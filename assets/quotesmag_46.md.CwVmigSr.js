The character was created for the series by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, and Andrew Kreisberg. Diggle is portrayed by David Ramsey. In the series, Diggle is introduced as a military veteran and Oliver Queen's new bodyguard. Over time his relationship with Oliver evolves and he becomes his best friend and confidante in his crusade as the Green Arrow, joining him as Spartan and for a while succeeds him as the Green Arrow. After Oliver returns as the Green Arrow, he leaves the team and joins A.R.G.U.S. Ramsey reprises his role in the Arrowverse series The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and Supergirl. The character also appears in the Arrows tie-in novels and digital comics, as well as the Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham video game. While Diggle was originally created for the television series, since 2013 a character of the same name has appeared in the Green Arrow series published by DC Comics. Creation and casting Actor David Ramsey speaking about Arrow at Phoenix Comic con in 2014 In February 2012, David Ramsey was cast in the pilot episode of Arrow as John Diggle, a \\"former military man now working as a bodyguard for hire who soon finds he is trapped in a battle of wits, loyalty and trust\\". The character was created by Arrow creators Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg. Named after comic book writer Andy Diggle, and created specifically for the series, Guggenheim said Diggle was designed to be Oliver Queen's (Stephen Amell) equal in \\"many respects\\" such as their abilities and intelligence. He further explained that Diggle's mutual abilities were a means of setting him up early in the series as a confidant for Oliver's vigilante persona. Ramsey enjoyed the fact that he did not have to worry about matching the comic books, saying, it allowed him to \\"just kind of take [his character] and run with it\\".  Development  =Characterization= David Ramsey has compared Diggle to Alfred Pennyworth from the Batman comics, describing the character as Oliver's \\"moral voice\\". Ramsey, who has trained in various martial arts such as Wing Chun, Jeet Kune Do, and kickboxing, used his martial arts expertise to make Diggle believable, saying, \\"I think, honestly, it has to do with...having Diggle able to not just handle himself on screen but be able to really proficiently use the (martial) arts ‚Äî and look like he is a trained soldier. You don't see the stunt guy. You actually see David Ramsey doing it.\\" He has stated that since Diggle is older than most of Team Arrow and, to an extent, more experienced on the field and reconnaissance fighting, the other members \\"look to him for some leadership\\". While describing the other Arrow characters, particularly Team Arrow members like Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards) as \\"extraordinary\\", Ramsey said people would be able to identify with Diggle because \\"he's just a guy who decided to better himself.\\" He also said Diggle is not \\"a goody-two-shoes, but he‚Äôll stand up in your face and tell you the right way to get something done.\\" Ramsey also compared Diggle to Little John, a character in various Robin Hood stories. A running gag is that Diggle, whenever taken suddenly to places by Barry Allen / Flash at super-speed, vomits as a result of motion sickness, an exception being in the Arrow season 6 episode \\"The Devil's Greatest Trick\\". Diggle's military career and heroism led some fans to draw comparisons between him and Green Lantern John Stewart. In 2015, Ramsey confirmed there had been talks of turning Diggle into \\"John Diggle Stewart\\". This was referenced in the 2018 \\"Elseworlds\\" crossover event, where Barry Allen of Earth-90 indicates that on his Earth, Diggle is the Green Lantern. The series finale of Arrow features a scene where Diggle witnesses a meteor crash, and finds a box emitting a green light, which Ramsey said was a reference to fan theories that Diggle would become the series' version of Green Lantern. = Relationships = Regarding Diggle's relationship with Oliver in season 1 after realizing he is a vigilante, Ramsey said that \\"the biggest change is that they start working together\\", adding that, \\"He [Diggle] makes it clear to Oliver that this isn't about me being a yes man. This is about me understanding what you do and what it does to you as a person. What it does to your humanity.\\" After Diggle leaves Team Arrow and joins A.R.G.U.S. in season 6 due to his differences with Oliver, Ramsey said, \\"he obviously loves Oliver, but he sees that there's more than one way to save the city. He's still committed to Oliver, to a certain degree, but even more so than Oliver, to the people of the city.\\" Ramsey, Rickards and Amell at Heroes and Villains Fan Fest San Jose in 2017 Diggle, alongside Felicity, is shown to play an important role in the transitioning of Oliver from a 'lone-wolf' to part of a vigilante team. This working relationship between these three characters has been described both in the media and the show as 'Original Team Arrow', and has received particular praise from critics. Commenting on this \\"symbiotic relationship\\", terming it \\"Arrow's most important\\", Carrie Raisler of The A.V. Club stated \\"Amell, Ramsey, and Rickards have the kind of lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry that makes all their scenes together hum\\", in her review of the first half of season 2. Similarly, Jesse Schedeen of IGN, reviewing the season three premiere, described the three as the \\"core trio\\" of the show and Jenny Rafferty of Vulture, writing about season four, described the relationship between the three as \\"the heartbeat of the show\\". Looking back at the series during her review of the season seven finale, Della Harrington of Den of Geek commented that \\"The magic of the show and the magic of his [Oliver's] team within the show alchemised when John Diggle and Felicity Smoak signed on.\\" Juliana Harkavy, who plays Dinah Drake, described Diggle as Drake's \\"best friend\\" and \\"her family\\". = Combat skills= Having served in the military, Diggle is well-versed in live combat, and his primary skill is marksmanship. He is also proficient in stick-fighting and knives. While his primary weapon of choice is a firearm, he is shown to be able to knock out people simply by striking them with his arms. He has also been shown to be on par with Oliver in fighting skills. Early in season 6, when Diggle takes up the Green Arrow mantle at Oliver's request, he wields a crossbow named \\"Green Monster\\" that was created by Felicity and Curtis and fires arrows. = Costume = For the first three seasons of Arrow, Diggle does not have a vigilante costume. By the time season 4 begins, he has gained one, which consists of a helmet and black gear. Via social media, the helmet was criticized by fans for its resemblance to that worn by the Marvel Comics character Magneto. In response to the criticism, Ramsey said, \\"I know there's a lot of criticism that it looks like the Magneto helmet. But by the time you see Diggle in action ‚Äì we also get into what the helmet can do ‚Äì you won't be thinking of the X-Men at all.\\" In season 5, Diggle replaces his helmet with a new one, which Ramsey said can do \\"extraordinary things\\", apart from being just about concealment. Concept artist Andy Poon said the new helmet offers Diggle \\"full protection\\". He added that, since Diggle's codename is Spartan, he decided to make the helmet resemble \\"an actual spartan helmet design\\". Poon, a comic book fan himself, thought the new helmet would fix \\"the issues regarding some of the fan feedback about [the older helmet] looking similar to other comic book characters\\". Later in season 6, Diggle gains both a new Spartan costume and helmet, which eschew the gray overtones of previous Spartan costumes, and instead have a black and red scheme.  Appearances  = Arrow = In season one John Diggle is introduced as a former United States Army Special Forces soldier, honorably discharged with the rank of master sergeant in the pilot episode. He is hired as the bodyguard of billionaire Oliver Queen, and later becomes his confidant in his mission to save Starling City. Diggle tries to help Oliver balance his normal life and vigilante life, and occasionally helps him in the field. Diggle provides Oliver with medical assistance, limiting his need for hospital treatment. Already a skilled fighter, Diggle receives additional training from Oliver. Diggle has a grudge against Floyd Lawton / Deadshot who allegedly killed his brother, Andy. Diggle dates his brother's widow, Carly, and is a father figure to her son, Andrew \\"A.J.\\", during this season. In season two Diggle and Felicity Smoak continue to help Oliver with his crusade and Diggle continues to be Oliver's adviser and field partner, along with Sara Lance and Roy Harper. Diggle has a relationship with his ex- wife Lyla Michaels, is an unofficial member of A.R.G.U.S., and a member of the Suicide Squad under the codename \\"Freelancer\\". He also develops an uneasy alliance with Amanda Waller who occasionally asks him for field assistance with A.R.G.U.S. missions. In the season finale, it is revealed that Lyla is pregnant with Diggle's child. Diggle continues to help Oliver and his team during season three, but has to devote more of his time to his new baby with Lyla, whom he names Sara after Sara Lance is killed. After Lyla is seriously injured in an attack, they decide to remarry. When Oliver is presumed dead at Ra's al Ghul's hands, Diggle leads Felicity, Roy, and Laurel Lance until his friend's return. After Oliver's return, Diggle accompanies him to Nanda Parbat to help him free Malcolm Merlyn, but the two are captured. Diggle and Lyla marry after a near-death experience with the Suicide Squad, when Lawton sacrifices himself for them. Diggle and Lyla decide to quit Team Arrow and A.R.G.U.S. for their daughter's sake. After Oliver leaves the team to join the League of Assassins as part of a deal to revive a near-deceased Thea Queen, Diggle becomes the team leader, though he is not yet ready to forgive Oliver for kidnapping Lyla as part of a deception to gain acceptance by the League. Season four sees Diggle continuing to protect Starling City, now renamed Star City, with Laurel and Thea. Now going by the codename \\"Spartan\\", he discovers that the organization that targets the newly-named Star City is H.I.V.E., who had hired Lawton to murder Andy. Diggle eventually forgives Oliver after their fight with a H.I.V.E. metahuman operative named Jeremy Tell. With Quentin Lance's help, Diggle learns that Damien Darhk had Andy murdered, and that he was a drug cartel leader and Darhk's territorial rival prior to his death. However, Diggle discovers that Darhk actually faked Andy's death and recruited him as a H.I.V.E. soldier, leading Diggle and his brother to become enemies. Guilt-ridden over his brother's role in causing Laurel's death, Diggle seeks revenge against Andy and Darhk. Diggle kills Andy after the latter threatens to harm Lyla and Sara. He initially lies to Lyla that he killed Andy in self- defense, but Oliver encourages Diggle to admit the truth to his wife. Diggle rejoins the army after confiding to his wife and Darhk's defeat. In the second episode of season five Diggle is betrayed by his commanding officer, J.G. Walker, following a failed attempt to sell nuclear weapons. Framed for Walker's crimes, Diggle is arrested. Oliver and Lyla break him out of state prison, and Diggle stays at H.I.V.E.'s former base until his innocence can be proven. Diggle remains guilty about killing Andy and continues to serve as Spartan to redeem himself. Due to the events of The Flash episode \\"Flashpoint\\", Diggle's family history is altered: his daughter Sara has been erased from existence and replaced by John \\"J.J.\\" Diggle, Jr., as a result of a timeline change caused by Eobard Thawne, correcting the Flashpoint reality created by Barry Allen. Felicity is later able to prove Diggle's innocence by restoring the digital files that Walker had destroyed. However, Andy's betrayal and death at Diggle's hands has taken a toll on him; he struggles to control his rage and occasionally pulverizes criminals to vent it, fueling Oliver's concern over his erratic behavior. Diggle later befriends Oliver's chosen successor to Laurel's mantle, Dinah Drake, a Central City detective, and encourages her to set down roots in Star City. Diggle, along with the rest of Team Arrow, is later captured by Adrian Chase and taken to the island Lian Yu. Chase later detonates the explosive-rigged Lian Yu by shooting himself dead, with Diggle still on the island. The season six premiere reveals that Diggle survived the explosion by taking shelter in a plane like the others. However, he was wounded by bomb shrapnel and suffers a degenerative nerve injury that affects his motor control that requires taking daily medications, resulting him to develop a drug dependency. When Oliver decides to retire from being the Green Arrow, he appoints Diggle as his successor, oblivious to the fact that Diggle is currently not in condition to remain in action. Oliver returns to vigilantism until Diggle is fully recovered from his injury. Curtis Holt develops an implant for Diggle to help him control his tremors as he progressively recovers. After Oliver decides to remain being the Green Arrow, Diggle accepts the job offer from Lyla as one of the commanding officers in A.R.G.U.S., using his new position to lead his subordinates to maintain order in the city's police's place due to them having been compromised by crime lord Ricardo Diaz. Near the end of the season, Diggle is fully healed and no longer needing Holt's implant. His A.R.G.U.S. team later joins forces with FBI agent Samanda Watson's subordinates, and working with Team Arrow, they ultimately take back the city from Diaz, who goes into hiding. In season seven, Diggle remains working at A.R.G.U.S., and continues leading his manhunt against Diaz. The combined efforts of Diggle, A.R.G.U.S. and the other members of Team Arrow (except Oliver, who is in prison) result in the successful capture of Diaz. After Oliver is released from Slabside Maximum Security Prison in exchange for Diaz, Diggle and Felicity are the first to receive him. Later, Diaz is recruited by Diggle as a member of the \\"Ghost Initiative\\", his own version of the Suicide Squad. Diggle plans to use Diaz to locate Dante, the financier behind the legendary Longbow Hunters. Diggle returns to vigilantism along with Curtis and Rene Ramirez to capture the criminal Chimera. Despite succeeding, the trio are arrested for violating the city's anti-vigilante law, but mayor Emily Pollard ultimately offers to drop the charges against them, provided they agree to be deputized and work for the police, as Oliver has. The Ghost Initiative is successful in locating Dante, but when Diaz betrays the team and helps Dante escape, Diggle hands in his resignation to A.R.G.U.S. to save his wife's job, while sending Diaz back to Slabside. Diggle later meets his late father's commanding officer Roy Stewart; Diggle's father died during an operation abroad and he blames Stewart for leaving his father behind. Stewart went on to become Diggle's stepfather and put both Diggle and Andy through rigorous training to turn them into real soldiers, resulting in a strained relationship between Diggle and Stewart. The two make amends when Diggle learns that his father died because of his own negligence and Stewart is the reason anyone survived the operation. After Team Arrow thwarts the Ninth Circle's plan to destroy Star City, Diggle takes Oliver and a pregnant Felicity to an A.R.G.U.S. safe house in the woods where the two can raise their child safe from the Circle. The season also features flashforwards that take place in 2040. These feature Diggle's adoptive son Connor Hawke and reveal that J.J. is the leader of the Deathstroke gang. Connor states that J.J. grew up hating their parents and the expectations they put on them and considers the gang his way to rebel. In season eight, Diggle meets six-year- old Connor for the first time, but does not yet adopt him. After the adult Connor is accidentally teleported from 2040 to 2019 with Oliver's children, Diggle is shocked and devastated to learn that J.J. is psychopathic and becomes Grant Wilson's prot√©g√© and successor as Deathstroke and kills Rene's daughter Zoe in the future. Though these revelations strain their friendship, Diggle and Rene are determined to change their respective children's fates. Despite Diggle learning that his future bond with his adoptive son is what possibly would cause J.J. to take the path of vice, Diggle chooses to accept his destiny to Connor while trying to save J.J. After the events of the Crisis, during which Oliver perished, Diggle's daughter Sara is restored to existence. While moving to Metropolis, Diggle is intrigued by a crashed spaceship and discovers a mysterious box that glows green. = The Flash = In season one, Diggle arrives at Central City with Oliver and Felicity to locate a criminal who uses lethal boomerangs (Digger Harkness), but ends up assisting Team Flash (Barry's team) in defeating Roy Bivolo. In season two, Diggle and the rest of Team Arrow aid Team Flash during their fight with Vandal Savage. Later in the season, when the metahuman King Shark escapes from his A.R.G.U.S. prison and arrives at Central City to kill Barry, Diggle and Lyla arrive to warn the latter. After King Shark is defeated by the combined efforts of Team Flash, Diggle and Lyla, he is taken back to A.R.G.U.S. In season three, Diggle learns of the alteration of his life with Lyla, his daughter's erasure and his son's status as a time aberration, and despite the hurt caused by these circumstances, he chooses to forgive Barry. In season four, Clifford DeVoe infiltrates the A.R.G.U.S. facility holding the metahuman Neil Borman by impersonating Diggle and kills most of the security; overcharging and killing Borman to be a nuclear battery for his satellites. Afterwards, Barry brings the real Diggle to S.T.A.R. Labs to reveal the location of the facility. In season six, Diggle arrives in Central City to give Barry the mask he gave Oliver the first time they met. Diggle also helps him come to terms with Oliver's death. = Legends of Tomorrow = In season two, Diggle aids Team Arrow, Team Flash and the Legends of Tomorrow in their fight against the alien race of Dominators, who leave Earth after being defeated. In season 3, Diggle, who is an ordained minister, officiates Barry Allen and Iris West's wedding, simultaneously marrying Oliver and Felicity as well. In the fifth season, during the crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", Diggle's family history changed again after the multiverse's rebirth. His daughter, Sara, again existing in the new \\"Earth-Prime\\", who is now being J.J.'s sister. = Supergirl = In season four, John Deegan, a mad scientist, uses the Book of Destiny to rewrite reality on Earth-1; in this new reality, Diggle is working for him. This reality is undone by the combined efforts of Oliver, Barry, Kara Danvers / Supergirl and Clark Kent / Superman to restore the original reality. = Print media = John Diggle, in his DC Comics publications' canon debut on Green Arrow #24 (Dec. 2013 DC Comics). Art by Andrea Sorrentino. The character appeared in Arrow 2.5, a bi-weekly digital comic series that bridged the gap between the end of season two and the start of season three. He also features in the tie-in novels published for the series, Arrow: Vengeance, written by Oscar Balderrama and Lauren Certo, The Flash: The Haunting of Barry Allen written by Susan and Clay Griffith, and its sequel Arrow: A Generation of Vipers from the same authors, as well as Arrow Fatal Legacies, co-authored by Marc Guggenheim and James R. Tuck, published in January 2018. This novel bridged the gap between the season five finale and the season six premiere of Arrow. While Diggle was originally created for Arrow, a character of the same name was introduced into the Green Arrow comics during The New 52 run, in 2013, but having little resemblance to Ramsey's likeness. Looking at any elements of the show which would transfer to the comic-run, writer Jeff Lemire described the character of Diggle as \\"the breakout of that show\\", and wanted to incorporate elements of that into his story. When DC rebooted its continuity with Rebirth in 2016, Diggle continued to feature in the Green Arrow comics. = Video games = The character appears in the Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham video game as part of the Arrow DLC pack. As well as featuring in the add-on pack's level, Diggle can also be used in any other level as a freeplay character.  Reception  Writing for the DC Comics website, Ashley V. Robinson named Diggle as one of her \\"all-time favorite characters\\". Jesse Schedeen of IGN praised Ramsey's performance in the episode \\"Brothers in Arms\\", calling it \\"easily Ramsey's strongest episode in a long time\\".

Alv√©ole is specialized in the development of devices for controlling microenvironment in vitro. Its first product is Primo, a contactless and maskless photopatterning device allowing researchers to control the topography (via microfabrication) and biochemistry (via micropatterning) of cell microenvironment.  Products  Alv√©ole's first product is Primo, a photopatterning device which can be docked on standard inverted microscopes. Primo photopatterning technique is based on LIMAP technology and combines a maskless and contactless photolithography system controlled by a dedicated software (Leonardo) and a specific photo-initiator. This system modulate UV-light illumination through an array of micromirrors (digital micromirror device). The UV light is then projected through the objective of the microscope onto the substrate in order to either perform microfabrication or protein micropatterning.  Microfabrication: The modulated UV light is projected on a photosensitive resist. The cured photoresist can then be used as a mold to deposit PDMS and generate microstructured PDMS chips.  Protein micropatterning: The modulated UV light is projected onto a standard cell culture substrate previously coated with an anti-fouling polymer and reacts with the photo-initiator to locally degrade this coating. Adhesion proteins can then be adsorbed on the illuminated area only, allowing for the creation of proteins micropatterns on which cells can adhere.  Applications  By micropatterning adhesions proteins with a sub-cellular resolution, Primo enables to control cell adhesion and isolate single cells under highly reproducible conditions. This allows cell biology researchers from various fields ‚Äì such as mechanobiology, toxicology, immunology, oncology or neurosciences ‚Äì to control or study intracellular mechanisms or screen the effect of molecules on cell functions. On a larger scale, Primo also makes it possible to control complex cellular arrangements, to study cell migration, axon guidance. Furthermore, the micropatterning process with Primo can be performed on microstructures' sides, top or bottom, making it possible to confine single cells or multicellular arrangements in three-dimension. One last known possible application is the photopolymerization of photo-sensitive materials, such as resins for microfabrication or photosensitive hydrogel to include rheological cues in cell microenvironment or to create permeable membranes in microfluidic channels.

It can be found on the flowers of various plants in Central America and North America, where it waits to prey on other insects. Subspecies These four subspecies belong to the species Phymata americana: * Phymata americana americana Melin, 1930 i c g b * Phymata americana coloradensis Melin, 1930 i c g b * Phymata americana metcalfi Evans, 1931 i c g b * Phymata americana obscura Kormilev, 1957 i c g Data sources: i = ITIS, c = Catalogue of Life, g = GBIF, b = Bugguide.net  Habitat  Phymata americana are found in open fields of flowering plants near rural forest edges, farms, and urban areas.  Camouflage and color polymorphism  Although P. americana can be found on many species of flowering plants, they tend to prefer either yellow or blue flowers over red or white flowers. Variation in flower color choice may reflect individual variation in P. americana color pattern, where individuals prefer flowers which match their own body color. This habitat-matching behavior may confer benefits for increased camouflage and prey capture ability. However, increased camouflage can also be achieved through a small degree of phenotypic plasticity in color pattern (i.e. color changing ability).  Diet and predation behavior  Phymata americana feed on a wide variety of prey, most often including small bees, moths, and flies. As their common name suggests, P. americana are sit-and-wait ambush predators, resting on flower heads where they grab visiting insects with large raptorial foreleg weapons. Females can be larger than males, and often have disproportionately longer weapons. Sexual dimorphism in weapon morphology in P. americana may have evolved due to sex differences in prey capture strategies, with females capturing prey from underneath flower heads and males either eating prey already captured by females or capturing smaller prey on plant stems while searching for mates. Females tend to capture larger prey species than males due to their larger weapons, potentially decreasing intersexual resource competition.  Mating and reproduction  = Mating behavior = Phymata americana males actively search for females. After finding and mounting the female, males produce tactile and stridulatory courtship behaviors thought to be assessed by the female during mate choice decisions. During this time, males may also guard the female from competitors. = Sexual selection on color pattern = Phymata americana show sexual dimorphism in size and color pattern. Males tend to be darker than females, although only as adults. Additionally, the degree of coloration is condition dependent, with increased food availability resulting in darker males and females. Although many sexually dichromatic species use color signals in elaborate courtship displays, color patterns in P. americana do not appear to be involved in signalling behavior to rivals or potential mates. Darker males absorb more radiative heat and as a consequence heat faster and reach hotter temperatures than lighter males. Because this allows darker males to find mates more quickly (potentially due to the thermal sensitivity of muscle function), darker males are favored by intrasexual selection in cooler climates. However, darker coloration in males is less advantageous under hotter environmental conditions because it can increase heat stress. In addition to environmental temperature, the strength of sexual selection on color pattern depends on demography, with strongest selection occurring when male-to-female sex ratio is low and at high densities.

He has been credited as the author of a number of works such as The Metropolis that created a sensation in Dublin in the early 1800s. He was regarded as dissolute, and according to contemporary accounts, ended his life in poverty in Constantinople where he was decapitated and his body thrown into the sea. Early life William Norcott was born around 1770, and graduated BA from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1795. He received his LLB in 1801, and his LLD in 1806.\\"Norcott, William\\" by David James O'Donoghue in Dictionary of National Biography, 1885‚Äì1900, Volume 41. Career Norcott was called to the Irish bar in 1797, and according to David James O'Donoghue in the Dictionary of National Biography was successful for a while, but preferred social life to his legal work. He was popular at Dublin Castle during the Duke of Richmond's viceroyalty and in Dublin society, partly due to his excellent skill at mimicry. He was described in Jonah Barrington's Personal Sketches as \\"a fat, full-faced, portly-looking person.\\" O'Donoghue wrote that Norcott was the author with his friend John Wilson Croker of a number of poetical satires that were published in Dublin after the union with Great Britain, and that the following pieces could be attributed to him with confidence: *The Metropolis, an attack on various Dublin institutions, dedicated to John Wilson Croker, 1805; 2nd ed. 1805. *The Metropolis part 2, dedicated to Thomas Moore, 1806; 2nd ed. 1806. *The Seven Thieves: A Satire, by the author of \\"The Metropolis,\\" dedicated to Henry Grattan, 1807; 2nd ed., 1807. *The Law Scrutiny; Or the Attornie's Guide, a satire, dedicated to George Ponsonby, lord chancellor of Ireland, 1807. These works were published by John Barlow of Bolton Street, who also published Croker's Familiar Epistles and, according to O'Donoghue, caused a considerable stir in Dublin. Norcott, Grady, and Croker were each thought to be the author, and Richard Frizelle was also credited with writing The Metropolis. According to O'Donoghue, an author in the Dublin University Magazine (lviii. 725) named Norcott as the author, as did Barrington and Richard Lalor Sheil. It has also been claimed, however, that Andrew Blair Carmichael was the author of both parts of The Metropolis. Norcott was described as a \\"reckless gambler and generally dissipated\\" who \\"soon fell into debt and disgrace\\". His library of law books was sold by Thomas Jones in Dublin in December 1810.Kennedy, M√°ire. (2001) French Books in Eighteenth- Century Ireland. Voltaire Foundation. p. 210. In 1811 his art collection was also sold.Dido Conducting Aeneas into Carthage. Victoria & Albert Museum. Retrieved 6 May 2018. About 1815, however, through Croker's influence, he obtained an excellent position in Malta but failed to hold it for long, and fled the island \\"entirely discredited\\". Later life After leaving Malta, Norcott eventually reached Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire, where he lived by selling rhubarb and opium in the streets. He then travelled to Morea, and on to Constantinople where he lived in poverty, became a Muslim, and wrote to his friends in \\"heartrending\\" terms. Around 1820 he rejected Islam and attempted to leave Constantinople, but after being pursued and captured, was decapitated and his body thrown into the sea. The story of his later life is included in detail in Sheil's Sketches of the Irish Bar and also in Barrington's Personal Sketches.

It forms diffuse colonies with tiny, inconspicuous flowers and small, more or less round leaves and grows mainly in mosses places in beech forest. Description Townsonia deflexa is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs which grow in small groups with their tubers connected by a fleshy root. It spreads through mossy patches and leaf litter. Each tuber produces one or two leaves. The leaves of both flowering and non-flowering plants are very thin with wavy margins and a relatively long petiole. They emerge at ground level and are egg-shaped to almost round and about long. Flowering plants also have a similar leaf on the flowering stem except that it lacks a petiole. Up to four flowers about long are borne on a flowering stem high. The flowers are green with red blotches. The sepals are V-shaped in cross section, the dorsal sepal broader and slightly shorter than the lateral sepals. The petals are erect, oblong and much shorter than the sepals. The labellum is also shorter than the sepals and is thicker along its mid-line with two ridges of calli. Flowering occurs from November to February. Taxonomy and naming Townsonia deflexa was first formally described in 1906 by Thomas Cheeseman and the description was published in his book Manual of the New Zealand Flora.

The tradition entailed the use of a hobby horse that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth. It represents a regional variation of a \\"hooded animal\\" tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles. The Lancashire Old Ball custom differs from other animal head traditions in Britain by being associated with Easter; most of the others were instead carried out at Christmas time. Demonstrating potential links to other regional traditions is the use of the name \\"Ball\\" for hobby horses in other areas. At Ashford and Little Hucklow in Derbyshire, the Old Horse tradition was recorded as using hobby horses named \\"Ball\\", while at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, the hobby horse was called \\"Young Ball\\". Description The Old Ball tradition took place around Easter. The term \\"Ball\\" or \\"Old Ball\\" was the name of the hobby horse that featured in it. This hobby horse consisted of a horse skull affixed to a pole, with the bottom of glass bottles for eyes. The pole was carried by a man hidden beneath a sackcloth, and there was sometimes a tale affixed to the outfit. The hobby horse was taken around by a group of about six men, who disguised themselves by blackening their faces or wearing masks. This group sang a song, although its lyrics and tune were not recorded. Old Ball itself would chase people in order to obtain money from them. History and regional distribution The southern point of the custom's distribution lies near the foothills of the Forest of Rossendale. It was also recorded in neighbourhoods of Blackburn and Burnley, near the northern margins of that forest about 15 to 20 miles north. All of the settlements in which it was recorded were industrial towns; those in the south were mostly connected to cotton spinning, while the two in the north were associated with cotton weaving. Recorded accounts of the Old Ball tradition all come from the first three quarters of the nineteenth century. Old Ball was part of a wider \\"hooded animal\\" tradition that the folklorist E. C. Cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of Britain. Features common to these customs were the use of a hobby horse, the performance at Christmas time, a song or spoken statement requesting payment, and the use of a team who included a man dressed in women's clothing. In South Wales, the Mari Lwyd tradition featured troupes of men with a hobby horse knocking at doors over the Christmas period. In south-west England, there are two extant hobby horse traditions ‚Äî the Padstow 'Obby 'Oss festival and Minehead Hobby Horse ‚Äî which take place not at Christmas time but on May Day. Although the origins of these traditions are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's Morris dance tradition, which became a \\"nation-wide craze\\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into \\"a set of sharply delineated regional traditions\\".

The deepest point is in the southern part of the lake, rising to a shallow platform, ranging in depth from 22 to 24 m. In the northern, relatively shallow part of the lake, the depth change is smoother compared to the southern part. The height above sea level of the surface of the lake is 109 m. The shores of the lake are somewhat elevated, and the lake itself lays in a small basin. The hills encircling the lake are most distinctly manifested from the south, where they form an arc. The height of the hills reaches 122‚Äì124 m above sea level (13‚Äì15 m above the lake's water level) and are separated by deep (7‚Äì8 m) ravines. The lake's water is very pure and transparent to a depth of more than 5 m. The lake is cold, and fed by numerous bottom keys. The banks are weakly swamped. To the north-east is the small, shallow Lunda River, from which the lake is connected by a stream. The runoff from the lake through the stream was disturbed during the construction of a road during the Soviet era. As a result, the lake began to swamp. Restoration of natural lake flow occurred in the 1990s. The volume of the lake basin (not the lake itself) is about 1.5 km, and the area of the lake itself is 14.83 hectares. The thickness of the bottom sediments is about 8 m. Origin Various researchers at different times have hypothesized about the glacial, karstic, old, volcanic, neotectonic, salt-dome, and meteorite origin of the lake. The first explorer of the lake in the late 19th century was a Russian geologist, Vasily Dokuchaev, who suggested it was a meteorite crater. The volcanic origin of the lake was first suggested in the early 20th century by the writer Vladimir Korolenko. Amateur archaeologist A. P. Polivanovhttp://starina44.ru/polivanov-a-p-issledovanie-bogorodskago- gorodischa conducted excavations on one of the Svetlogorsk hills and discovered the remains of ancient tools related to the Stone Age. In 1969, under the leadership of Mark M. Barinov,Barinov, M.M., 'The new worlds of underwater archaeology - diving into the past' , UNESCO Courier, May 1972 'Underwater Archaeology' (special issue), pp.5-7 - http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000782/078276fo.pdf scuba divers using acoustical systems detailed the complex structure of the relief of the bottom of the lake. The central pit-hollow is fringed by a system of two underwater terraces, expanding in the northern and narrowing in the southern parts of the lake and having depths of 18-20 and 9‚Äì10 m, respectively. It was suggested that a multistage cyclic-periodic formation, very young in the scale of geological time, as a result of neotectonic processes. Based on this, it was concluded that the central basin was formed a little more than a millennium (about 1100‚Äì1200 years) ago in the form of a small lake with a depth of 15‚Äì17 m, and the immersion of the lower terrace occurred approximately 700‚Äì800 years ago. Recently, of the origin of Svetloyar and some neighboring lakes. In 2009, bolstered the hypothesis of the meteorite origin of the lake, around 3 thousand years ago.

Geographically, the custom was found in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and part of Yorkshire. The tradition entails the use of a hobby horse that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth. It represents a regional variation of a \\"hooded animal\\" tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles. In geographical location and style it displays strong similarities with the Old Tup custom, but in the latter the hobby horses was presented as a goat rather than a horse. The custom is similar to that of the Old Tup, which was largely found in the same area of England. In Derbyshire, the two customs are often recorded as existing in the same village. Old Horse was less common in Yorkshire than Old Tup, and also spread further into Nottinghamshire than the Old Tup custom did.

History If a train was accidentally divided, the drawing apart of the hose pipes would cause the brakes to be applied on both sections of the severed train. However, in shunting operations, it was necessary to have an arrangement by which the carriages may be disconnected when required, without the application of the brakes. Thus, a train-cock was installed at each end of the carriage where the hose-pipes were attached. If the hose-pipes were disconnected, and the train- cocks left open, the brakes were applied throughout the train. Therefore, train-cocks had to be provided.Westinghouse Brakes: Pearson's Coupling. Good Work by a New Zealand Inventor. Progress, Volume IV, Issue 6, 1 April 1909. Page 203. The not infrequent forgetfulness of a shunter to open the train- cocks after coupling-up the hose-pipes has caused accidents in the past. A further risk in connection with these cocks lied in the fact that they could be tampered with by passengers. Out of eleven accidents in New Zealand, eight have been the result of somebody's negligence in leaving train-cocks closed. In Pearson's invention the cocks are necessarily closed and the levers engaged by the lugs, before the heads could be coupled together. The action of turning the heads upon one another, while the levers were engaged by the lugs caused the cocks to open, because the ports of the plugs registered with the ports in the cocks, leaving the brakes in a condition ready to be applied. The heads could not be uncoupled in the ordinary way without the operations being reversed and the cocks left open. If the heads were accidentally pulled apart, as by the severance of a train, the cocks remained open, and the brakes were thereby applied.

Therefore, while focusing the needs of Indian museums, Dr. Dinesh Katre, Senior Director at C-DAC initiated the development of e-curator software named as JATAN (‡§ú‡§§‡§®): Virtual Museum Builder in 2001, which was developed and released in 2004. Subsequently, JATAN (‡§ú‡§§‡§®) software was deployed in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Museum, Mumbai; Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum, Pune and The Baroda Museum & Picture Gallery in Vadodara. Although the response from museums was lukewarm, C-DAC continued developing JATAN (‡§ú‡§§‡§®) software into a comprehensive digital collection management system for museums. As part of this research,early visions of using crowdsourcing method for metadata enrichment of museum artefacts and unified virtual catalogue for Indian museums was presented in 2005. During 2013, Ministry of Culture started the Vivekananda Memorial Museum Excellence Program in collaboration with The Chicago Institute of Art, USA. As part of this program various existing software solutions available in India were evaluated and finally JATAN: Virtual Museum Builder was selected for standardized implementation across national museums.  Certification Program for Museum Curators The team of Human-Centred Design & Computing Group at C-DAC, Pune organized JATAN certification training program in order to motivate and prepare the museum curators in taking on with the challenging task of digitization. Several batches of this 2 days training program for the museum curators were conducted. The training covered digitization best practices, hands on experience of JATAN software and exposure to advancements in digital heritage preservation, 3D Virtual walk- throughs, mobile apps, touch screen kiosk applications for museum visitors. Around 50 curators from 10 national museums were trained as part of this initiative.  Standardized Implementation of JATAN (‡§ú‡§§‡§®) in National Museums  In the first phase this project, Ministry of Culture decided to implement JATAN (‡§ú‡§§‡§®) software in the following 10 national museums - * National Museum, New Delhi * Allahabad Museum, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh * Indian Museum, Kolkata, West Bengal * National Gallery of Modern Arts (NGMA), New Delhi * National Gallery of Modern Arts (NGMA), Mumbai, Maharashtra * National Gallery of Modern Arts (NGMA), Bengaluru, Karnataka * Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) Museum, Goa * Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) Museum, Nagarjunakonda, Andhra Pradesh * Salar Jung Museum, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh * Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata, West Bengal As per the technical specifications provided by Human-Centred Design & Computing Group at C-DAC, Pune the museums procured and established computer labs equipped with computers, server, digital camera, scanner, Network Attached Storage (NAS), Local Area Network (LAN) and broadband connectivity, etc. The museums also arranged local technical support for maintenance of this facility. Major achievement of this effort was that museums became self-reliant and started with the digitization at their own. After the successful implementation of JATAN software in 10 national museums, C-DAC was entrusted with a new project to develop the National Portal and Digital Repository for Museums of India.  National Portal and Digital Repository for Museums of India  Ministry of Culture funded and entrusted this project to C-DAC, Pune with the objective of providing online and integrated access to digitized collections of 10 national museums by establishing the National Portal and Digital Repository for Museums of India. Human-Centred Design and Computing Group at C-DAC Pune designed and developed the portal as well as the software tools required for cataloging and digital repository management. The main features of the national portal are as under- * The portal introduces India‚Äôs rich heritage through a diverse range of digital collections in terms of sculptures, paintings, manuscripts, arms and weapons, terracotta, pottery, coins and a numerous other category of antiquities. * Search and retrieval across all museums and categories * Automatic keyword suggestions * Parameter based filtering of search results * High resolution images with zoom-in/out and metadata * Direct access to digital collections through categorization * Virtual exhibitions with scholarly essays published by museum curators * Automatic timeline mapping of objects * Dedicated homepages for museums to managed by nodal officers * Museum wise access to digital collections * Museum wise event announcements * Portal administration * Scalable framework of virtual museums The portal was inaugurated by honorable Minister for Ministry of Culture, Government of India, Shripad Naik on 21 October 2014. Presently, the national portal is providing online access to over 1,15,000 historical antiquities with approximately 5,00,000 digital images with metadata produced by 10 national museums.  Data packaging and transfer  Digitization and metadata integration is undertaken locally in each museum. Transfer and integration of museum data in centralized database was the major challenges before us as museums are still to be connected over National Knowledge Network (NKN). Therefore, JATAN software has been supported with the functionality to package and transfer the digitized contents to C-DAC, Pune.  Process for acquisition and ingesting of museums data  = e-SANGRAHAN (‡§à-‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡§£): E-acquisition tool = It is a digital data acquisition tool which receives the packaged data sent by the museums and makes to available for ingesting in Sanskriti Digitalaya system. = DIGITƒÄLAYA (‡§°‡§ø‡§ú‡§ø‡§ü‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ø): e-Library and Archival System = It is an e-Library and Archival System primarily focusing on the long term archival and repository development of digitized contents in image, audio and video formats. This system is an adaptation of CCSDS Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model, ISO 14721: 2012 in cultural heritage domain. It supports the domain specific metadata standards like MARC21, Dublin Core, MODS, METS, etc. The system allows to configure archival strategies and dissemination package for the public access portal. Human-Centred Design & Computing Group at C-DAC, Pune has designed technical quality assurance procedures for data acquisition, archival and dissemination. The correctness of information is to be ensured by domain experts in museums only.  Unique advantages  * The National Portal and Digital Repository for Museums of India has dissolved the physical walls and removed the geographical distances between 10 national museums by merging them into a single Virtual Museum which can be accessed online through single window. * Students and teachers can access the museums directly from home or classrooms. * Researchers, scholars, historians and tourists can access the antiquities from anywhere. * The project has created a comprehensive national database / register of museum antiquities which is necessary for management, protection and conservation of historical antiquities.  Recognition  National Portal and Digital Repository for Museums of India won the Grand Jury Special Mentions Manthan Award in 2015 in e-Culture and Heritage Category. Hon'ble Minister for Culture, Dr. Mahesh Sharma has appraised Rajyasabha on the progress of JATAN Project in an official press release dated 4 April 2018. Another press release on capacity building to improve standards in museums also mentions about the progress on museums of India in collaboration with C-DAC, Pune.

It originally aired on FX in the United States on May 2, 2018. Plot When Elizabeth (Keri Russell) returns home from drinking with Claudia and Paige, Philip (Matthew Rhys) tells her about Stan's visit and that Philip sabotaged the Kimmy kidnapping as a result. Dennis tells Stan (Noah Emmerich) that the X-rays of one of Gennadi's diplomatic pouches showed that the pouch contained a sensor chip from Altheon in Chicago, which (because of the D.C. killings related to Altheon) led the FBI to a vulnerable Altheon engineer in Chicago. In turn, he identified a Russian illegal code-named \\"Harvest\\", whom the FBI currently have under surveillance. Dennis and Stan also note the upcoming summit and Oleg's return, which they do not believe are coincidental. Dennis convinces Stan to temporarily return to counterintelligence and lead an effort to run down leads in D.C. based on the tradecraft used by \\"Harvest\\", such as small business fronts, cars bought from free paper ads for cash, advance payment of utilities at safe houses, and contact with Russian Orthodox priests. Henry comes home for Thanksgiving and sees the distance between his parents. Following Paige's idea, Elizabeth pretends to be a D.C. consultant and makes contact with Jackson, a congressional intern from Sam Nunn's office. Philip lays off three of his travel agents, beginning with Stavos. Claudia notifies Elizabeth and Marilyn to go to Chicago to extricate \\"Harvest\\", who was also working on Dead Hand, and reminds Elizabeth that neither she nor \\"Harvest\\" can be captured. When \\"Harvest\\" realizes that he's being followed, Elizabeth has to leave on Thanksgiving, causing her to miss the Jennings' Thanksgiving dinner at Stan's with Renee and Dennis's family. Renee thanks Dennis for advancing her application to the FBI. After dinner, Philip reviews Elizabeth's hidden records, including her drawings from Emily's lessons, and \\"dead drops\\" a coded message to Oleg, which Oleg retrieves and decodes in his hotel room. Elizabeth and Marilyn agree that their chances of success with \\"Harvest\\" are poor. Elizabeth calls Henry, which Philip interprets as a possible \\"last call\\" before her death. Philip calls Elizabeth and asks her to abort the mission; when she refuses, he offers to go to Chicago to help. Production The episode was written by Stephen Schiff and Justin Weinberger, and directed by Kevin Bray. The title of the episode is based on the 1955 French film, Rififi, which is the movie that Elizabeth and Jackson (the intern) see when she makes first contact. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Rififi\\" was seen by an estimated 611,000 household viewers and gained a 0.15 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received positive reviews.

He was among a group of close associates of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos referred to in media as \\"Marcos cronies\\", having benefitted from his close association with Marcos. The Marcos mansion at 2442 Makiki Heights Drive in Honolulu, Hawaii, in which Marcos spent the last years of his life in exile, was registered under the name of Floirendo Sr.  Early life and family Floirendo Sr. was born on November 20, 1915 in Bauang, La Union. He was in his 20s when World War II took place, and made a living through the war by ferrying passengers on his calesa (horse drawn carriage). He eventually married Nenita R. Floirendo, with whom he would have six children.  Early career  After the war, Floirendo Sr. was among those who took up President Elpidio Quirino's call for people from Luzon and the Visayas to seek opportunities in Mindanao. In Davao, he eventually put up Davao Motor Sales (DAMOSA), the first Ford dealership outside Manila. In the 1950s, Quirino gave Floirendo his big break by issuing a proclamation that granted Floirendo the title to a total of 1,200 hectares of previously-unproductive marshland in Davao del Norte. He founded Tagum Agricultural Development Company, Inc. (TADECO) with the intent of turning the land into an abaca (Musa textilis) plantation. The abaca plantation was highly successful at first, but began to decline in the 60s with the development of synthetic nylon ropes. Floirendo Sr. promptly shifted TADECO's focus from abaca to bananas.  Association with Ferdinand Marcos  Antonio Floirendo Sr. became a close business associate of the Marcoses before Ferdinand Marcos became president, and was a major contributor to Marcos‚Äôs 1965 and 1969 presidential campaigns. He also contributed to many of First Lady Imelda Marcos' projects, and was a regular part of Imelda's entourage. TADECO during the Marcos Dictatorship  During the Macapagal administration, TADECO leased 6000 hectares of prime, fertile, government land for use as a banana plantation. However, the project was halted because it violated the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines and Philippine corporate law, which permitted only up to 1,024 hectares of land acquisition. Senator Lorenzo Ta√±ada chaired a Senate Blue Ribbon Committee investigation into the matter, which caused Floirendo to shelf the plan and wait for a more favorable political climate. The plan finally came into fruition after Marcos‚Äô second term. When Marcos declared Martial Law in the early 1970s, TADECO began exporting its bananas to the Japanese market, resulting in phenomenal growth for the company. = Hiring of Prison Laborers = Floirendo also hired prisoners from the Davao Penal Colony (Dapecol) as his laborers, permitting him to take advantage of prison labor at starvation wages. Prisoners of Dapecol were given the most physically strenuous jobs in the plantation, such as harvesting, hauling and drainage work. Workers carried over 50 kilos of bananas in long distances, and were severely punished if they damaged the quality of the bananas along the way. The prisoner-laborers were exposed to many health hazards, such as inhalation of chemicals, flu, pneumonia and other respiratory diseases that they caught due to the extent of the labor. Overseas Properties Floirendo also served as a front for the Marcoses in purchasing international properties, a fact he acknowledged when he inked a compromise deal with the Philippines' Presidential Commission on Good Government after the Marcoses were ousted in 1986. With former First Lady Imelda Marcos, he purchased three condominium apartments in Olympic Tower in New York City. He purchased two units at the St. James Towers in Manhattan. He purchased a $1.35 million mansion in Makiki Heights in Hawaii. He purchased the $4.5 million Lindenmere estate in Long Island New York, and a $2.5 million Beverly Hills property.  1986 Escape to Brunei  The day before Ferdinand Marcos fell from power in 1986, Floirendo and his family fled from the Philippines to Brunei.  Compromise Deal with the Presidential Commission on Good Government  Antonio Floirendo Sr. signed a compromise deal with the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) in 1987, turning over about PhP 70 million ($1.5 million) in cash and assets. This included the Lindenmere Estate and Olympic Tower in New York City; a property in Beverly Hills, California; and the mansion at 2443 Makiki Heights Drive, Honolulu, Hawaii, in which Marcos lived in exile.  Death  Floirendo Sr. died of kidney failure on June 29, 2012 at the age of 96.  Descendants  Floirendo Sr. had six children, the second of which and his namesake, Antonio \\"Tonyboy\\" Floirendo Jr., would eventually become congressman for the 2nd District of Davao Del Norte. His grandson, Antonio Lagdameo Jr. (through his Daughter Linda Floirendo-Lagdameo) would also serve in the same post, in between the terms of his uncle, Tonyboy.

It forms diffuse colonies with tiny, inconspicuous flowers and small, more or less round leaves and grows mainly in mossy places in myrtle beech forest. Description Townsonia viridis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs which grows in small groups with the tubers connected by a fleshy root. It spreads through mossy patches and leaf litter. Each tuber produces one or two leaves. Both flowering and non- flowering plants have an erect, very thin leaf emerging at ground level. These leaves are pale green to yellowish and have wavy margins. They are long and wide with a petiole long. Flowering plants also have a similar leaf on the flowering stem except that it lacks a petiole and is well above ground level. Up to four flowers long and wide are borne on a brittle, fleshy flowering stem high. The flowers are green with red blotches. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are a similar length to the dorsal sepal but only half as wide. The petals are about long, wide and spread apart from each other. The labellum is a broad egg shape, long and wide, folded lengthwise with the tip turned downwards. Flowering occurs from November to January. Taxonomy and naming The beech orchid was first formally described in 1906 by Joseph Dalton Hooker who gave it the name Acianthus viridis and published the description in Flora Antarctica. In 1911 Rudolf Schlechter changed the name to Townsonia viridis. The specific epithet (viridis) is a Latin word meaning \\"green\\". Distribution and habitat The beech orchid grows in permanently wet forests, especially those of myrtle beech. It is found mainly on the west coast of Tasmania.

It is directed by Lee Philips and stars Lee Grant, Susan Myers, Lelia Goldoni and Helen Hunt. It touches on the subject of telekinesis and follows the story of an adolescent girl who seeks revenge on those who ridicule her, while her mother tries to bring an end to her evil acts. It has gained a reputation as being an imitation of the 1976 classic Brian De Palma film Carrie as several similarities are present, while it has fallen somewhat under the radar over the years and is seen as a \\"forgotten film\\". Plot Rita Matchett is a shy 15-year-old girl often picked upon for being overweight. One day in particular in her high school gym, Rita is teased by her classmates, in which she attempts to defend herself. While the girls take turns at rope climbing, Rita, struggling to climb, is opposite Jackie Segall, one of her snooty classmates. Jackie climbs to the top and begins to show off in front of the other girls by doing spins. Rita's stare becomes fixated on Jackie which causes her to fall off the rope and break her neck, killing her in the process. Rita comes from a wealthy family and her home life is unhappy. She is neither close with her father, Glenn, nor her younger sister, Kristina, who view her as fat and unattractive, and often criticize her for her looks. Her mother, Marilyn, tries to maintain a balance in the home and is constantly upset by how Rita is treated and the rivalry between her daughters. Marilyn becomes furious with Rita when her attitude begins to change. However, she grows more concerned when Rita shows signs of abnormal behavior and starts speaking in chant, following an argument. It later becomes evident that Rita is dabbling in something dangerous as a number of \\"accidents\\" seem to occur; Glenn is almost injured in a hit-and-run incident but is unharmed, while Marilyn's friend, Kathleen, having been ill for sometime, suddenly dies due to spontaneous combustion and Kristina almost drowns in a swimming pool. Marilyn is initially not convinced that Rita is behind these attacks, but Kristina confirms her suspicions when she reveals to Marilyn that Rita has been visiting Jo Standish, the school gym teacher, and they chant together. Rita had threatened Kristina to keep quiet about it. Glenn informs Rita that she will be leaving home to attend a private school London, much to her disapproval, resulting in her to act aggressively. Marilyn sends Glenn and Kristina away for the night so that she can spend time with Rita. That evening, Marilyn follows Rita to Jo's house where she watches in secret as the two discuss the recent events and discovers that Jo caused the accidents so that Rita could seek revenge. When Jo tells Rita that their power will extend to a new community, Rita becomes upset as she believes that she will no longer be different and unique if others were to be like her. In the disagreement, the two begin to chant, and with her new powerful strength, Rita forces Jo to the ground. Back at home, Marilyn confronts Rita and begins to chant which violently forces Rita to be thrown around the room, while Marilyn tells her that it is over and if Rita insists on hurting her father and sister that she will destroy her. It is revealed that Marilyn also has power as Rita tries to retaliate and the two begin to constantly chant until Marilyn overpowers Rita, bring it all to an end. Marilyn comforts a sobbing Rita telling her that it is all over.

Columbia was impressed with Taggert's writing and his take on the theme of telekinesis. However, the film was slow to get off the ground and during the pre-production process, Brian De Palma's similarly themed Carrie became acclaimed and widely successful, which resulted in the film being converted into a teleplay for a network television Movie of the Week. Taggert claimed that he completed his script for the film while Stephen King was writing Carrie. Both films open with a similar scene in which the character, Rita, in The Spell, is teased and picked on by her classmates, which is how Carrie opened. As The Spell premiered on NBC three months following the release of Carrie, it was seen as an imitation. Release =Premiere= The Spell was broadcast on NBC on February 20, 1977 at 8:00 pm. =Reception= The film has received mixed reviews from critics. In an early review from Harriet Van Horne from New York Magazine, she said that \\"you will shudder at The Spell, giggle in the wrong places, and, NBC hopes, and stay tuned in to learn all about telekinesis.\\" Of actress Lee Grant, she stated, \\"Grant is too fine an actress for this sort of TV trash\\".Van Horne, Harriet In an online review for The Terror Trap, it was said of the film that \\"overall, a little slow at times but not bad\\". When reviewed for The Horror Honeys website, it was stated of the film that \\"It's not the perfect revenge film, but it is an interesting snapshot of the era and there are far worse ways to kill an evening\\". Chris Hartley of The Video Graveyard mentions that \\"The Spell is pretty forgettable stuff. When taken for what it is, it's not a complete waste of time and does have some unintentional chuckles and solid performances propping it up, but it's also just another forgotten 70s TV flick.\\"Hartley, Chris The film has been reviewed in several blog posts; in a 2009 blog post for Final Girl, Stacie Ponder said that \\"This is a made-for-TV effort that's fairly tame even for its time period\\" and \\"It's little more than a pleasant 70-minute diversion\\".Ponder, Stacie Jeffery Berg of the jdbrecords commented that \\"it's pretty preposterous, kind of boring, and sometimes hilarious.\\" When it film was reviewed in a blog post for Horror Movie a Day, it was said that \\"even as a TV Movie this thing is shockingly dull throughout.\\" =Home media= In the United States, The Spell received a VHS release courtesy of Worldvision Home Entertainment Inc. in 1984 following its television broadcast, which was rare considering that television films of the time were not picked up for home video distribution. The film received a second VHS release in the U.S. from GoodTimes Entertainment. It has been released on VHS in several European countries including Finland and Spain. It has never been made available on DVD format. It was released on Blu-ray format in North America on September 5, 2017 via Scream Factory, a subsidiary of Shout! Factory, under license from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment and MGM Home Entertainment. The set contains the film's original broadcast ratio of 1.33:1, DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 and English Subtitles, while special features consist of a new commentary by made-for-TV historian and author Amanda Reyes and a new interview with screenwriter Brian Taggert. It was available for streaming in the United Kingdom via Amazon Prime Video, which was added to the service on February 21, 2019 and removed on September 5, 2019. Similarities to Carrie With the telekinesis theme becoming increasingly popular following the release of Brian De Palma's Carrie, an adaptation of Stephen King's 1974 novel, many films attempted to recreate this theme, with little success; The Spell was the first to do so and although claimed that the script with written prior to King's novel, many similarities appear in The Spell including the opening scene in which the character, Rita, is bullied by her classmates, family issues, and telekinetic revenge. In the final scene in the film, which concerns the showdown between Rita and her mother, Marilyn, Rita uses her power to hurl knives at Marilyn; although missing her aim, it is much like the ending to Carrie in which Carrie kills her mother by launching flying knives through the air. Many films which have been considered imitations followed this, some of which include, Jennifer (1978), Patrick (1978), Evilspeak (1982), and to a lesser extent, Laserblast (1978).Muir, John Kenneth Other films with a similar theme include The Fury (1978) and Firestarter (1984).

He made his professional debut at sandanme tsukedashi, which allowed him to skip the lower divisions, in March 2016, and his first makuuchi division honbasho was the Natsu tournament in May 2017. His highest rank has been maegashira 1. Early life and sumo background Oyanagi started doing sumo his first year of elementary school. He abandoned sumo in junior high school in favor of baseball and continued until entering high school. He started to feel he was reaching his limit in baseball and in high school because of his size he went back to participating in sumo. After a fairly successful high school career he chose to continue doing sumo at Tokyo University of Agriculture where he majored in forestry in the Faculty of Regional Environmental Science. Each spring in Osaka the members of the Tokyo University of Agriculture sumo club would have joint training with the members of Tokitsukaze stable. This is where he was introduced to Tokitsukaze-Oyakata who was also a Tokyo University of Agriculture graduate. He was later told by him that he should join professional sumo, which he accepted. Career =Early career= Oyanagi won no major titles in his amateur career, being somewhat prone to lapses in concentration and overconfidence against some of his key rivals. However, having finished in the top eight at the All-Japan Sumo Championship he was granted sandanme tsukedashi which allowed him to skip the lower divisions and start at sandanme 100. He won his debut basho with a 7‚Äì0 championship, he matched this performance the following tournament to win the makushita division. After two more winning tournaments he made his sekitori debut by being promoted to j≈´ry≈ç in November 2016. =Top division career= Following three successful tournaments in j≈´ry≈ç he was promoted to the top makuuchi division in May 2017. To mark the occasion he changed his shikona or fighting name from his own surname of Oyanagi to Yutakayama, a prestigious name at Tokitsukaze stable that had previously been used by the former ≈çzeki and head of the Japan Sumo Association Yutakayama Katsuo and former komusubi Yutakayama Hiromitsu. He could only manage four wins at the rank and was demoted back down to the second division for the next tournament. He managed a runner-up performance and was promoted back up the following tournament only to match his record for May 2017. After coming back to the makuuchi division for the third time he was finally able to get a winning record of 9‚Äì6 at maegashira 14 and followed that performance with a 10‚Äì5 at maegashira 11, which saw him promoted to the upper maegashira ranks for the first time, at maegashira 3. Fighting all the top ranked wrestlers for the first time he could manage only a 2‚Äì13 record, but in the following July tournament he produced his best performance to date, with a 12‚Äì3 runner up performance including a final day victory over the tournament winner Mitakeumi. He was awarded his first special prize, for Fighting Spirit. Promoted to his highest rank to date of maegashira 2 in September 2018, he withdrew from the tournament on Day 5 after sustaining an elbow injury in his Day 3 defeat to Kisenosato. He returned to the tournament on Day 9 and won three bouts out of his remaining seven matches for a 3‚Äì10‚Äì2 record. Three more losing records saw him demoted from makuuchi after the March 2019 tournament. He returned to the top division in September 2019 and three straight winning records saw him climb to maegashira 3 for the March 2020 tournament. Fighting style Yutakayama is an oshi-sumo wrestler, who prefers thrusting and pushing at his opponents to fighting on the mawashi or belt. His most common winning kimarite is oshi-dashi, or push out.

Sanguan arranged a coalition of five parties, including Sahaphum and the Democrat Party that tried to topple Phibunsongkhram's government in a vote of confidence. Sahaphum Party particularly accused the government of failing to provide peace and order. The opposition could not disempower Phibunsongkhram by parliamentary means, so Sarit Thanarat launched a successful coup d'√©tat on 16 September 1957. King Bhumibol Adulyadej appointed Sarit \\"Defender of Bangkok\\" and he ruled the country by means of a \\"revolutionary council\\". However, Sarit promised not to stay in power permanently and appointed Pote Sarasin as a civilian prime minister. Sukich Nimmanheminda and Sanguan Chantharasakha held posts in Pote's cabinet (economy minister and deputy minister of industry, respectively). Sarit also called an election for December 1957. With 44 of 160 seats, the Sahaphum Party finished as the strongest party. Nevertheless, its performance was considered disappointing, as it was far from a majority and did badly in the major cities, not winning a single seat in Bangkok or Thonburi. Strongman Sarit quickly lost his interest in the party. Instead he founded the National Socialist Party as the new pro-government party a few days after the election. The National Socialist Party hoped to win over former members of Phibunsongkhram's Seri Manangkhasila Party who had been reelected as independents, while the Sahaphum Party had refused to accept former Seri Manangkhasila members in their ranks. Pote Sarasin resigned as prime minister, Sarit's right-hand man Thanom Kittikachorn, vice-leader of the National Socialist Party, succeeded him. His cabinet included six members from the Sahaphum Party. During the following period, the party was divided between those who wanted to join Sarit in his new party and those who wanted to continue with the Sahaphum Party. 26 Sahaphum MPs resigned from the government benches in February 1958, protesting a cut in educational expenditure, while military spending was increased.

She was the author of the very popular cookbook \\"Mrs. Maclurcan's cookery book : a collection of practical recipes specially suitable for Australia\\". She is also known as Hannah Maclurcan Lee.  Early life  Hannah Phillips was born on 17 October 1860 in Tambaroora, New South Wales, the daughter of Jacob Aaron Phillips, a London-born Jewish storekeeper and his first wife Susan (n√©e Moses) from Scotland. Her mother died in 1866. Her family moved to Toowoomba before she was a year old and then on to Brisbane when she was 10.  Hotelier  Her father owned a number of hotels and Hannah gained a thorough knowledge of the business at a very early age. Her father put her into the kitchen of his hotel at Brisbane in Queensland, and she worked through the dining room to the office, until she knew how to organise and manage a hotel. When she was only 15 years of age, she was manager for her father of the Club Hotel in Sandgate although her obituaries state incorrectly it was Toowoomba. On 25 March 1880 Hannah Phillips married English born Robert Watson Wigham at her father's home in Brisbane. The couple had their first daughter born in February 1881. They left for England later that year and their second daughter was born there in 1882. Hannah returned to Australia in 1883. In April 1884, Hannah Wigham applied for her first publican's licence which was for the Club Hotel on the corner of Margaret and Ruthven Street, Toowoomba. She married her second husband, Donald Maclurcan, in June 1887. Her father was bankrupt in January 1892 owing ¬£4,000. In 1894, she and Donald moved to Townsville, running the Criterion Hotel and then moving to the Queen's Hotel. Maclurcan's cookbook known as \\"Mrs. Maclurcan's Cookery Book\\" was first published in 1898. She helped the Townsville printers, Thankful Willmett, to set the type, and when the establishment ran out of type, she bought some more. The first edition sold out in a fortnight. The second edition was published in Sydney. The third edition was published in London, at the time of the jubilee of Queen Victoria, who accepted a copy. Until 1929 there was a new edition published almost every year. The Maclurcans came to Sydney in 1901, when Donald leased the Wentworth Hotel which Hannah described as \\"with 30 rooms and an unpopular name\\". Donald died in 1903. The venture was an unusually large business undertaking for a woman in those days. She did all the cooking for two years with only the help of two Chinese boys in the kitchen. When her chefs refused duty at the Wentworth Hotel at one point, she locked the gates on them and took on new men. In 1909, Hannah purchased the lease of the hotel and undertook ambitious plans to expand. In 1912, she raised capital on the Stock Exchange by forming The Wentworth Hotel Limited, a limited liability company and she became its governing director ‚Äî a position she retained for more than 20 years. During that time she bought land on either side of the hotel, and remodelled and rebuilt until she had achieved a modern hotel. She was actively associated with the management of the Wentworth Hotel until 1932, when she handed over responsibility to her son Charles Dansie Maclurcan (born 1889). Although Charles was an electrical engineer who used the flat roof of the hotel for his pioneering experiments in wireless transmission, he had been a director of the company since 1916. Maclurcan's daughter Evelyn Clara (born 1888, later Mrs F. C. Postle) was also a director. Throughout her life she was involved in numerous charities. During World War I, she worked for numerous comfort funds for the troops.  Later life  In 1924, Maclurcan purchased a house called Bilgola at Bilgola Beach from William Bede Dalley, which became the focus of her life and a place to display her curios and antiques. On 17 August 1931 Maclurcan married Robert Lee at St Nicholas's Church of England, Mordialloc, Melbourne. Maclurcan Lee died at St Vincent's Private Hospital Sydney on Sunday 27 September 1936 at 75 years of age. She was survived by her husband, Robert Lee, her three daughters: Mrs. Ralph Moore, whose home was in England, Mrs. Spencer Watts, and Mrs. F. C. Postle and her son, Charles Dansie Maclurcan, of Strathfield, one of the pioneers of wireless in Australia. Her husband Robert Lee died on 17 October 1937 at Waverley.  Legacy  Her son Charles Dansie Maclurcan was a prominent early wireless experimenter before WW1 (callsign: XDM) with his firm of Maclurcan and Lane. When amateur licensing recommenced after WW2, Charles was one of a handful initially licensed and the first to commence regular music broadcasts from 1922 (callsign: 2CM). Her grandson Donald Charles Boulton Maclurcan (son of Charles) became a well-known architect. The Wentworth Hotel continued operation under the control of the Maclurcan family until 1950 when Qantas Empire Airways purchased a controlling interest. Qantas constructed a new 400 room Wentworth Hotel completed in 1966 which it operated until 1982 when the hotel was sold. In 2002, the hotel was purchased by the Accor Group and under that ownership operates (as at 2018) as the Sofitel Wentworth Hotel.

In 1991, she starred in the Toei V-Cinema work Josh≈´ Sasori: Satsujin Yokoku of the Josh≈´ Sasori series and gained popularity. Both of her reasons for getting off the plate are said to have been disputed without getting nude, both for rest by physical condition. In the meantime, she decided to temporarily suspend her entertainment activities with the opportunity, during which she reported her neurose theory and weight loss, and transferred to her affiliated office. After that, she became a regular of the television variety programme, Hey! Say! A Board of Education, often showing rare answers with natural blurring. From a sexy tarento who sells sex appeal, she turned into a variety talent of whatever character she gave away. On June 1995, a police officer at a hotel caused a fuss with her and became a topic. After that, in a row, returned troubles and troubles in cosmetics shops were reported, and Natsuki Okamoto also became an article when there was something to kill the entertainment world. In the same year her staff's separation would be reported as well.

A Board of Education, Ken Shimura no Daij≈çbudaa and Monomane ≈åzakettei-sen also lost the broadcast on Fuji Television, and in April 1996 all the programmes were gone. Her offer of work has decreased and looked back on that time later as \\"getting scolded.\\" Her television appearances were rare in the 2000s, but she appeared frequently in golf pro-am tournaments. She made regular appearances in late-night television programme Yorubijo on April 2005. Prior to that, in February of the same year, she appeared in Cream Nantoka as a mother in a skating rink.

This pattern was broadcast at 5-Ji ni Much≈´! on 20 and 27 August of the same year. From October 2011 and March 2016, Tokyo's local television station Tokyo MX's 5-Ji ni Much≈´! stepped down as Tuesday regular. In May 2017, she returned to the television for the first time in about a year with the special edition of Cream Nantoka broadcast by AbemaTV. Personal life =Nominal profile problem= The content of the profile published about Okamoto has often been raised doubt, and its content is often described as \\"self-describing.\\" Age misrepresentation Born in 1967, she was younger her than real age, and in February 1991 it was reported that she was not 23 but actually 25, later she was born in 1965 and her profile was changed. In 1995 it was reported that there was a rumour that in Sh≈´kan Josei, she was 35 years old. She ate 37 beans at Setsubun at the television talk show Lion no Gokigenyou broadcast on 3 February 1997, two years later, which is supposed to eat the same number as the age, actually she revealed she was 37 years old. About this, the person herself said in 2010, \\"I tried to eat a lot of beans at once in order to make you laugh.\\" The allegation of age spoofing recurred around 2000, but Okamoto herself continued a stance that could be taken as a midway affirmation about the truth of suspicion, and calmed down as soon as tacit consent. In the 2010s, she had disclosed an identity document to prove her date of birth, and in J≈çh≈ç Live Miyane-ya on 17 December 2010, she actually released a driver's license stated as \\"12 September 1965\\" in the broadcast. Okamoto talks that, \\"please go to pick up your family register,\\" \\"even if I show my health insurance certificate I do not believe my actual age,\\" etc., even though she herself makes a suspicion about age spoofing. =Friendship= She was a colleague when she served as a race queen of the Nissin Cup Noodle Racing Team in 1990, and had friendship with Izumi Sakai (Zard), which later became popular as a singer.

He was tried for three homicides and sentenced to thirty years in prison, and as of 2016 is free.  Biography  The son of diplomat Hamlet Gonc√°lvez (died on July 16, 1992), who fulfilled functions representing Uruguay in Spain. At nine years old, Pablo settled in Uruguay, in the Carrasco neighbourhood. There he attended primary school at the Stella Maris College and completed his high school studies in a public high school. A member of the Montevideo high society, he entered as a student of economic sciences, in the Faculty of the Economic Sciences of the University of the Republic.  Sentence  The first homicide victim was Ana Luisa Miller Sichero, which took place in the early hours of the morning of January 1, 1992. The victim was 26 years old, had a degree in history and a practicing teacher, and was the sister of the well-known tennis player Patricia Miller. The autopsy revealed that the young woman was suffocated and then thrown out at 8 AM on January 1, 1992, on the beach of Solymar. At the time of her death, she maintained a relationship with engineer Hugo Sapelli, who was the initial suspect, but took the polygraph test, passed it without incident and left the authorities with no evidence to incriminate him.Gabriel Pombo, Historias de asesinos, en Google libros, Montevideo, 2010, , p√°gs 237-239. The second murder was that of 15-year old Andrea Castro, who was also suffocated to death on September 20, 1992, after leaving the England disco in Montevideo. This crime was perpetrated by manual suffocation and the peculiarity that, as a kind of signature, the criminal left a tie tied to his belongings to the neck of the deceased. When a series of similar ties were found in the hands of Gonc√°lvez, the prosecution counted it as one of the most incriminating pieces of evidence. The third victim, 22-year old Mar√≠a Victoria Williams, died of asphyxiation inside of Gonc√°lvez's home. In this case, the murderer tricked his victim, who was his neighbour, into believing that Gonc√°lvez's elderly grandmother with whom he lived had suffered a heart attack, and he alone could not revive her. Once inside the farm, Gonc√°lvez strangled Williams and make sure of her death by placing a nylon bag over her head, enjoying the victim's agony. He then traveled to Porto Alegre, where his two half brothers lived. Pablo was caught in Brazil and taken to the Montevideo Headquarters. In Judicial Headquarters he was sentenced to 30 years in jail for being the sole perpetrator of the murders, although he pleaded not guilty to all charges. On March 6, 1999, he was attacked by two inmates and sustained 26 stab wounds, but on March 19 he left the Maciel Hospital and was transferred to Central Prison. But before the closing of the Central Prison, he was moved to a Campanero jail in Lavalleja Department. On July 7, 2005 he married a woman named Alejandra, and the ceremony took place in the premises of the Central Prison, located within the Police Headquarters of Montevideo, but later the couple divorced in 2015. In 2012, the defense requester early release, which was denied judicially. He continued to serve his sentence behind bars in a minimum security penitentiary located near the city of Minas, but enjoyed temporary exits. According to experts, the murderer had the same modus operandi in all three of the murders: that of Miller, Williams and Castro. Also bear in mind that despite the abundant amount of evidence in the case, the accused has emphatically denied guilt before various medias. = Freedom = Conc√°lvez was released on Thursday, June 23, 2016 at the age of 46, after having fully completed his sentence for the three homicides. He was favoured under the count of two or one, only for a reduction of condemnation given to all prisoners who work or study. The day of his release and the days before were characterized by a large media coverage at a national level, revealing the great interest of public opinion on the murders, and who appears to be the first condemned and identified serial killer in Uruguay. The media information disclosed consistent of brief reports from the Campanero penitentiary in Lavalleja (Gonc√°lvez's last place of imprisonment), as well as extensive interviews with criminologists, psychiatrists, criminal lawyers, etc. In 2017 he was arrested in Paraguay and is currently detained on charges of carrying an unregistered weapon and a quantity of cocaine.

Early life and education Morteza Neidavoud was born in Isfahan to an Iranian Jewish music-loving family. His musical gift was revealed at childhood. His father Bala Khan, who was a musician himself and played the tonbak, wanted to see his son enroll into a different field, and was thus initially against him becoming a musician. However, realizing his natural talent and determination, he eventually took him to see Ramazan Zolfaghari, a musician who was a student of Aqa Hosseinqoli. Neidavoud was trained by Zolfaghari for a short while and then he went to Aqa Hosseinqoli to learn from the master musician himself. Neidavoud learnt with Hosseinqoli until the latter's death in 1916. He then went on to learn music from Darvish Khan who was a famous student of Mirza Hossein-Qoli. During this time he picked up on playing radif and then the tar. At the end of three years he received the symbolic Golden Battle-Axe, awarded to outstanding students. Career In early 1925 he founded a class to teach the Iranian Tar and Radif. He named the school Darvish in honour of his master, who had died in 1926. His acquaintance with Qamar-ol-Moluk Vaziri at a private celebration led to the discovery of one of the greatest Iranian singing talents. The two continued to co-operate and as Qamar learned from him, she performed many of her famous songs. Since 1927, most of Qamar's lyrics and songs have been accompanied by Morteza Neidavoud. Following the establishment of the radio, Neidavoud worked with the broadcasters just like other artists did, some being Reza Mahjoubi, Ali Akbar Shahnazi, Habib Samayi, Abolhassan Saba and Musa Maroufi. He either wrote lyrics or composed for famous singers such as Qamar-ol-Moluk Vaziri, Maluk Zarrabi, Ruhangiz, Adib Khansari, Javad Badi Zadeh and Gholam Hossein Banan.

Two mock air attacks on Pearl Harbor during war games in the 1930s were judged to have been a success.Lt. Stephen Jurika, Saturday Evening Post, January 21, 1930. (Reports USS Saratoga simulated attack on Pearl Harbor.) Shortly after taking office, Navy Secretary Knox wrote an overview memo which specifically noted the possibility of an attack at Pearl Harbor. However, neither observation led to formal policy recommendations to forestall such an attack. Admiral James O. Richardson, who was fired by President Roosevelt for complaining about the President's order to station the Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor instead of its normal berthing on the U.S. West Coast,Pearl Harbor Countdown: Admiral James O. Richardson, by Skipper Steely, Pelican Publishing Company, 2008. blamed the President for the \\"initial defeats in the Pacific\\" as \\"direct, real and personal.\\" Richardson believed stationing the fleet in Pearl Harbor made the ships extremely vulnerable against attack and provided a poor and unstrategic defense.  Development of torpedoes  British ship with deployed torpedo nets during WWII The British proved that torpedoes could be effective in their attack on the Regia Marina at Taranto on November 11, 1940. The U.S. Navy discussed this new development as can be seen in a June 1941 memo.http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pha/hart/xha-019.html The British attack method was not considered relevant to a torpedo attack at Pearl, as Taranto was about deep and Pearl less than . The Royal Navy had used Swordfish torpedo biplanes, and their low speed was part of the reason the Taranto attack succeeded. The Imperial Japanese Navy no longer had any similar planes, so they had to develop other methods, both hardware and delivery technique. They independently developed shallow water torpedo modifications (called \\"Thunder Fish\\") during the planning and training for the attack in 1941. Wooden fins were added to the tail and anti-roll \\"flippers\\" kept the torpedo upright once in the water. The fins kept the torpedo's nose level in the air and broke off on entering the water. The flatter \\"flight\\" trajectory helped keep them from diving so deeply as to encounter bottom mud. (Despite these modifications, some Japanese torpedoes did indeed reach the bottom and several remain unaccounted for.) These simple modifications were not anticipated by the USN, and Admiral Bloch (commander of the Pearl Harbor Naval District) did not push to install torpedo nets or baffles at Pearl. Nor, it seems, did anyone else. Practical considerations also were an influence. Due to the shallow anchorage (which continues to require regular dredging), installation of torpedo nets would have severely restricted the mobility of vessels in the harbor. Kimmel and his staff testified regarding torpedo nets and booms: \\"(m) Fact XV ... The decision not to install baffles appears to have been made by the Navy Department.\\"The Statement of Facts, Part 39, and Navy Court of Inquiry Parts 32 and 33.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. History Lake Orion was first settled in the 1820s, and a number of mills were in place along Paint Creek. The mills flourished, attracting more settlers, and the village of Orion was platted in 1838. The first general store was opened that year, and a second added in 1843. By 1857, there were nearly two dozen businesses in the settlement. Orion was incorporated as a village in 1859, but a devastating 1862 fire that destroyed the business district caused the charter to be repealed. The downtown was quickly rebuilt, and the village reincorporated in 1869. In 1872, the Detroit & Bay City Railroad was completed through Orion. This stimulated local businesses and gave an outlet to the local agricultural market, with Orion as a primary shipping hub. It also gave visitors from Detroit easy access to Lake Orion, setting up the area as a resort hub. Lake Orion became one of the most popular resorts in southeastern Michigan. In addition to the 1862 fire, fires in 1874, 1894, 1901, and 1902 destroyed buildings in Lake Orion's downtown, resulting in infill of newer buildings. While the commercial section of the village grew, the residential section did also, but without the disastrous fires, resulting in a full range of houses existing, dating from the 1840s through the 1950s. At the onset of the twentieth century, the rise of the automobile contributed to a tremendous growth in Oakland County and in Lake Orion. Although the newest parts of the residential section of Lake Orion are not included in the historic district, the growth and mobility did change the village. The resort community declined in the twentieth century, and the new alignment of M-24 to bypass the downtown meant fewer shoppers for the village's commercial core. Orion began to change to a suburban community, but with an intact historic core. Description The Lake Orion Historic District includes about twenty-six blocks in the historic core of Lake Orion surrounding the intersection of Broadway and Flint Street, which was historically the commercial center of the village. The historic district includes a total of 280 properties, of which 218 contribute to the historic nature of the district. The commercial portion of the district generally contains brick one- or two-story buildings, spanning Commercial Italianate, Romanesque Revival, Moderne, Commercial Brick styles. At the edges of the commercial district, a number of formerly residential buildings have been converted to commercial uses. The surrounding residential area of the district consists primarily of wood frame houses built between the mid-nineteenth century and the mid-twentieth century. The oldest homes in the historic district are evenly dispersed throughout the area, with most early residents owning multiple lots surrounding their homes. As the village grew, newer homes began to fill in the lots between the original homes, with the result that many architectural styles are intermixed.

Parasequences are not directly related to sequences.  Definition  A parasequence is defined as a genetically related succession of bedsets that is bounded by marine flooding surfaces (or their correlative surfaces) on top and at the bottom. The succession is supposed to be relatively conformable in the sense that breaks in deposition within the parasequence are much shorter than the time of deposition of the parasequence itself. Most parasequences show a shallowing upward, which is sometimes also included into the definition.  Properties  Since parasequences are relatively conformable, so Walther's law applies within a parasequence. This is not necessarily the case for transitions from one parasequence to another.

Until relatively recently, it was uncommon for prime ministers in Australia to hold a university degree. Out of the first ten prime ministers, only three attended university and only two held degrees. However, nine out of the most recent ten prime ministers have been university graduates. The University of Sydney (seven), the University of Oxford (five), and the University of Melbourne (four) have been the most frequently attended institutions. The vast majority of degrees awarded to future prime ministers were in either arts or law. Only Edmund Barton, Earle Page, and Robert Menzies undertook postgraduate studies that resulted in a substantive master's degree. Six others undertook postgraduate studies in the form of a second bachelor's degree, including four who did so at Oxford University and proceeded to a Master of Arts by seniority. No prime minister has held a substantive doctorate, although Earle Page was a medical doctor. Bob Hawke dropped out of a Ph.D. program. Many of Australia's early prime ministers had limited formal education and left school at a young age to seek employment. Chris Watson, Andrew Fisher, and Joseph Cook all finished their formal schooling before the age of 13. John McEwen is the most recent prime minister to have had no secondary schooling, while Paul Keating is the most recent to have had no university education. Four early prime ministers were educated entirely outside of Australia ‚Äì one in New Zealand and three in Great Britain.

Built as part of a major restoration work of the Paris headquarter of French national radio broadcasting organization Radio France, it is located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris in the heart of the city. The Auditorium was designed to serve as the residence of the four musical ensembles of the organization : Orchestre National de France, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Ch≈ìur de Radio France and Ma√Ætrise de Radio France. Fully equipped with audiovisual equipment, the concert hall is also a recording and broadcasting studio and a screening room. The Auditorium is also devoted to Radio France seven national networks : France Inter, France Info, France Culture, France Musique, FIP, France Bleu, Mouv'.  Construction  Located near the Eiffel Tower and the Paris Department Store Beaugrenelle, Radio France's Auditorium was built on the former studios 102 and 103 of the Maison de la Radio. The official inauguration took place on November 14, 2014.  Architecture  Nine years after winning an international competition to restructure Paris‚Äô Maison de la Radio, AS architecture-studio composes the auditorium. Inspired by the Berlin Philharmonic, Radio France Auditorium has 1 461 seats. The auditorium is shaped like an amphitheater, wrapping around the stage, with the furthest seats only 17m from the stage, thus creating an exceptional proximity between the audience and the musicians, and a deep sense of intimacy. = Acoustic = Two architectural firms contributed to the Auditorium‚Äôs conception : Nagata Acoustics, an international acoustical consultancy firm involved in the design of over seventy concert halls, and Jean-Paul Lamoureux Accoustique firm. = The ¬´ box in the box ¬ª = The Auditorium is designed with the constructive principle of \\"box in the box\\". The acoustic is rather emblematic of radio sound : direct, accurately defined and close to the source. The result is quite spectacular : a perfectly accurate sound, soft that offers an incredible proximity, even from the most distant points. = Balconies and bleachers = Its interior is composed entirely of wood (cherry tree, birch tree and beech wood), balconies are repeatedly staggered. The result is quite amazing and very beautiful. The dark wood of the hall contrasts with the light wood stage where the musicians play. The wood panels and the polycylinders on the rear walls allow sound to travel through. = The canopy = The suspended ceiling is 18 m above the stage and is doubled with an acoustic reflector called canopy. This reflecting panel provides a good acoustic propagation and is greatly increasing the sound quality.  The organ  Organ, built between 2013 and 2016 by Gerhard Grenzing weighs around 30 tons, is 12 meters wide and 12 meters high.

Known primarily as the pastor of Plymouth Congregational Church in Lawrence, Kansas in the 19th and early 20th century, Cordley was an early settler of Lawrence and a survivor of both the Sacking of Lawrence and the Lawrence Massacre in 1863. Cordley wrote about the history of Lawrence and the state of Kansas later in his lifetime and was also the recipient of the first degree awarded by the University of Kansas. Biography Plymouth Congregational \\"Brick Church\\", shortly after being constructed, 1870. During this time, Cordley was the church's pastor. Cordley was born on September 6, 1829, in Nottingham, England. He later immigrated to Livingston County, Michigan, with his family when he was four. He began attending public school when he was about nine, although he had been taught how to read by his \\"cultivated\\" mother prior to his attending a formal school.Wilson (2004), p. 188. He earned degrees from the University of Michigan (B.A. 1854) and the Andover Theological Seminary (M.A. 1857).University of Michigan (1902), p. 34. \\"Richard Cordley, A.B., A.M. '57, D.D. (Kansas) '73\\". In 1874, he also was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of Kansasmaking him the recipient of the first degree bestowed by the then-fledgling KU.Burdick (1912), p. xiii. In 1857, he became the pastor of Plymouth Congregational Church in Lawrence, Kansas, a position that he held until 1875. From that later year until 1884, he served in Flint, Michigan, and Emporia, Kansas. Then, in 1884, he returned to Lawrence and resumed his role as the pastor at Plymouth Congregational Church. He died on July 11, 1904,Blackmar (1912). and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Lawrence. Interest in education Cordley was instrumental in the founding of both the University of Kansas and Washburn University in nearby Topeka. He was elected the president of the latter in 1871, but turned down the offer so that he might stay in Lawrence. He also served as a state board regent, and was an active member of the Lawrence School Board (serving as its president from 188591).Wilson (2004), p. 195. Religion and politics Cordley, according to Nathan Wilson, was a \\"staunch advocate of New England moral reforms,\\" and when he arrived in Lawrence, he began to impact the moral development of the town. In particular, he strove to promote strict Sabbath adherence, as well as the prohibition of slavery, the prohibition of alcohol sales and consumption, and advocacy for Christian fundamentalism.Wilson (2004), p. 190. Slavery, in particular, was despised by Cordley, and he established the Plymouth Congregational Church at least in part to aid and educate runaway slaves.Wilson (2004), p. 191. During the Bleeding Kansas period, Cordley was known as the \\"Abolition Preacher\\", due to his opposition to slavery.Burdick (1912), p. xi. Cordley spoke frequently about his belief in the importance of loyalty to God, family, and national identity, and is quoted in his posthumously released book Sermons as saying, \\"There are some things to which a man gives a specified service, and there are others to which he gives his entire self. A man owes his friends certain social obligations, but to his home he gives his entire self. A man does not gives sections of himself to the things that he loves. In some such sense Christ wants you. It is not a section of your personality, or time, or means, but of your entire self, with all which that implies that Christ wants. It is reasonable you should give yourself to your family, for your life is wrapped up in your family. It is reasonable you should give yourself to your nation, for your nation has in its keeping all that you have and are. It is reasonable you should give yourself to God, for God is the giver of all you have and the foundation of all you hope for.\\" In another service, Cordley said, \\"You may serve God in the home, but you are at the call of God to serve Him in whatever line his providence may lead you. The claims are God are higher than that of nation, for He created your nation. His claims are higher than that of family, for He made family possible.\\" In the same sermon, Cordley spoke of his belief that the education system in America only turned out copycats and instructors rather than genuine masters of a craft, saying, \\"Our schools are the glory of our age, but there are limitations to their capabilities and things in which they should never attempt to do. A college diploma is not a guaranty of scholarship any more than a church letter is a guaranty of sainthood. A college diploma often covers a record of laziness, and a limping course. Often they come to us in sheep's-skin clothing, but inwardly they are but simpering fools. It is not the fault of the schools, but it does show their limitations. We have schools of art which do grand work, but no school of art has ever had the temerity to advertise that it turned out artists. They turn out copyists and critics and even teachers of art, but not actual artists. There are schools of elocution, but they do not even pretend to turn our orators. So it is true that one cannot be made an artist or an orator. They are born not made. When God creates one He will open a door for him somewhere.\\" Because Cordley was an abolitionist who supported the free state movement, during the Lawrence Massacre (1863), he was hunted by pro-Confederate forces led by William Quantrill. While his home was burned, he survived, as did his church's building.Cordley (1903a), p. 212. (Quantrill later lamented that he was unable to kill the \\"Abolition Preacher\\".) Cordley was influential in documenting such events in the early settlement of Kansas.Cordley (1903b), p. 3. Commemorations Cordley Elementary School in Lawrence, KS was named after Richard Cordley.

This contrasts with RNA-sequencing of single cells, or the sequencing of bulk RNA extracted from tissue volumes, where precise spatial information is lost.  Method  When a tissue cryosection is attached to a spatial transcriptomic slide the barcoded primers bind and capture adjacent mRNAs from the tissue. While the tissue section is attached to the slide, reverse transcription of captured mRNA is initiated and the resulting cDNA incorporates the spatial barcode of the primer.

Powell's 1879 Report on the Lands of the Arid Region of the United States. Report on the Lands of the Arid Region of the United States is a scientific report and policy recommendation written by American explorer, geologist, and anthropologist John Wesley Powell, and first published in 1878. The work sought to create an equitable and sustainable method for developing the arid region of the United States, an area characterized by its low annual rain that encompasses 40% of the continental portion of the country. The work begins with a detailed account of the climate of the western United States, founded on Smithsonian climate data and Powell's personal observations from his own extensive surveys of the region.Powell, John Wesley, and William DeBuys. Seeing Things Whole: The Essential John Wesley Powell. Island Press/Shearwater Books, 2001. Powell describes the extent and potential of three main types of land in the region: irrigable lands, timber lands, and pasturage lands. After his initial establishment of the details of the arid region's climatic conditions, he questions several of the period's prevailing ideas of the West and crafts several policy proposals to be considered by Congress. Map of watersheds of the western arid region of the United States. Created by John Wesley Powell for the Eleventh Annual Report of the Director of the United States Geological Survey, Part 2- Irrigation: 1889-1890.  Policy critiques and proposals  In the report, Powell sites empirical evidence of rain patterns that contradict the theory that Rain follows the plow, which was widely propagated by politicians, scientists, railroad corporations, and proponents of Manifest destiny. Powell also argued against many common practices and laws used to settle unclaimed lands in the Public Domain managed by the General Land Office. Powell discouraged the practice of dividing government land into arbitrary rectangular plots for settlement, arguing that this technique ran the risk of concentrating valuable water resources on single plots, leaving adjacent plots unable to be settled, farmed or used for pasturage. He also pointed out the inadequacies of the Homestead Act of 1860 for settling the arid lands. The Act allowed individuals over the age of 21 to stake a claim for parcel of land of 160 acres. Powell argued that while this was fitting for the humid and sub-humid regions of the country, 160 acres of dry, western land would be too little to support grazing due to sparse vegetation and also too little for agriculture without irrigation due to scarce water availability. As one of the central tenets of his strategy for developing the western United States, Powell proposed that settlements consist of cooperative communities, similar to those of the Mormons, Pueblos, and Hispanic New Mexicans. This communal lifestyle would allow groups to pool the capital for the irrigation projects necessary to draw water from large rivers. This idea stemmed from the notion that smaller streams can often be diverted by individuals but irrigation projects from larger rivers require more work and capital than individual citizens can provide He proposed that collectives of 9 or more individuals be able to create their own irrigation or grazing districts with a maximum number of acres per person. The lands would be surveyed and classified primarily by the United States Geological Survey as irrigable lands, timber lands, pasturage lands, mineral lands, and coal lands. These would have different regulations for communal settlement. Individuals and groups would then democratically determine their own allotments and hold other individuals accountable to prevent fraud Political borders would be organized based on watershed boundaries, guaranteeing access to irrigation for a maximum number of individuals instead of allowing scarce water resources to be controlled by single allotments. In order to further ensure a democratic division of water, Powell was insistent in the report that water rights not be separated from land they irrigated on the basis that this would prevent developers from monopolizing water rights and extorting landowners.  Following events  The publication of Report on the Lands of the Arid Regions of the United States further established Powell's reputation as an authority on the western United States, its physical characteristics, and the problems it faced. On March 3, 1879, the same day that a second round of reprinting of the report was ordered, Powell's survey of the west was merged with two other competing expeditions to create the United States Geological Survey with Powell's peer and friend Clarence King as its first director. Powell was put in charge of the newly created Bureau of American Ethnology. In 1881, upon King's resignation, Powell was also appointed the second director of the Geological Survey. In these positions, Powell led efforts to catalog the disappearing cultures of Native Americans and further study the geographic character of the West. Under Powell, from 1881 to 1884, the Geological Survey became the largest scientific organization of its type in the world. In this time, Powell also continued to push his ideas on the orderly development and irrigation of western arid lands. In 1886, harsh blizzards killed livestock and subsequent of droughts devastated homesteaded farmers. In response, Congress appropriated funds in 1888 for the Geological Survey under Powell to undertake a survey of irrigable lands and identify possible areas for dams and irrigation projects, allowing one of Powell's main ideas the opportunity to become reality. With the same legislation, Congress also gave the Secretary of the Interior the ability to withdraw lands from the public domain, stating: > ... all the lands made susceptible of irrigation by such reservoirs, ditches > or canals are from this time henceforth hereby reserved from sale as the > property of the United States, and shall not be subject after the passage of > this act, to entry, settlement or occupation until further provided by law > ...\\" John Wesley Powell at a farewell dinner from the United States Geological Survey, after resigning as the 2nd director of the institution in 1894. The survey identified possible sites for reservoirs in Utah, Texas, and California through the summer of 1889. However, the survey's effectivity was compromised by speculators that followed the expedition and subsequently claimed land that it identified as irrigable, knowing that the land would be made more valuable by the planned irrigation projects. After the surveying and consequent speculation of the land around Bear Lake in Utah, the Secretary of the Interior responded by withdrawing all lands from the public domain until the survey could be concluded. This action caused immediate backlash from Congress, speculators, and normal citizens. The following year, the portion of the legislation that allowed the withdrawals from public domain was repealed. The Irrigation Survey was slashed, and in the following year of 1890, the overall US Geological Survey budget was slashed as well. With the financial troubles caused by the Panic of 1893, the Survey's chances of budgetary recovery were dashed. In 1894, Powell resigned as Director of the US Geological Survey to focus on his anthropological work at the Bureau of American Ethnology and his declining health.  Opposition  From the publication of the Report on the Lands of the Arid Region of the United States until the end of his term at the US Geological Survey, Powell's ideas had not gathered enough support to be codified into law. Powell received intense criticism for a multitude of reasons. Many individuals took issue with the report's recommendation that grazing allotments from the public domain be 2,560 acres. Powell saw this size as necessary for cattle to have enough pasturage to survive the arid conditions, others saw it as supporting wealthier ranchers and powerful investors instead of the average American. Powell was also opposed for his support of large-scale federal programs which were perceived as threatening private enterprise and the individual freedoms of western settlers. Western legislators, led by Senator William M. Stewart of Nevada originally championed the creation and funding of Powell's Irrigation Survey. However, Stewart soon clashed with Powell's direction of the program due to differing notions of the involvement of the federal government. Stewart imagined the expedition identifying potential sites for irrigation and then turning them over to private interests to develop. Powell, on the other hand, intended to create irrigation districts based on watersheds, invested in and governed by local communities, and overseen by the federal government. With the Secretary of the Interior's controversial withdrawal of all land from the public domain, Powell lost even more favor from the American public and gained further ire from vested commercial interests, making his plans for the scientifically managed development of the West politically impossible. As a result, Powell's ideas went generally disregarded with the Homestead Act, large-scale damming projects by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, and water rights untethered to the land being norms throughout the West in the years following [3][2].

Life  Albert Bonnier was the son of Gerhard Bonnier, a Jewish merchant and his wife Ester (n√©e Elkan). Gerhard Bonnier was born in Dresden in 1778 as Gutkind Hirschel and later emigrated to Copenhagen. There he changed his name to Bonnier and founded a publishing house. Bonnier's older brother Adolf was from 1827 in Gothenburg as a bookseller and moved two years later to Stockholm. Albert followed him and worked from 1839 to 1865 with his brother. In addition, he founded in 1837 a F√∂rlagsbyr√•, from 1858 as Albert Bonniers F√∂rlag AB firmierte. The publishing house is today part of the resulting media Bonnier Group AB. For training purposes, he traveled from 1840 to two years to Leipzig, Vienna and Pest. Albert Bonnier was married since 1854 with Betty Rubenson. Her daughter Eva Bonnier was a painter. Her son Karl Otto was also publisher and led from 1914 the father's company. Bonnier edited and published the Stockholms figaro between 1844-1847. And Sveriges Handelskalendar Bonnier added a number of strong titles, such as the Sveriges Handelskalendar, Folkkalendern Svea, the weekly publication Stockholms Figaro, and H√∂rbergska Tryckas... which began in 1859.

Previously he was a lecturer at Oxford University, a visiting professor at Harvard University and a researcher at the London School of Economics.  Biography  Scott was born 12 May 1965 in Enfield, London. He was educated at Firs Farm Primary School and Haberdashers‚Äô Aske‚Äôs, Elstree. He attended Trinity College, Oxford where he graduated with a first with prizes in Politics, Philosophy and Economics in 1987. He received a MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics in 1990 and was elected to a Prize Fellowship to All Souls College, Oxford in 1990. He was elected in the same year as philosopher Robert Rowland Smith and historian Scott Mandelbrote. He received his D.Phil (Essays in Aggregate Consumption) from Oxford in 1994. He worked briefly as an economist for Credit Suisse First Boston before holding research positions at London Business School and the London School of Economics. He then took up a lectureship at Oxford University, a Visiting Assistant Professor at Harvard before joining London Business School where he is currently Professor of Economics having previously served as Deputy Dean. Alongside his academic career Scott has been a non-executive director for the UK‚Äôs Financial Services Authority and an advisor to the House of Commons, the Bank of England, and H.M.Treasury. He is currently on the advisory board of the UK‚Äôs Office for Budget Responsibility and a member of the Cabinet Office Honours Committee (Science and Technology).  Work  Most of Scott‚Äôs published academic work has focused on macroeconomic fluctuations ‚Äì originally on business cycles (with a number of joint papers with Daron Acemoglu) then on monetary policy and most recently on fiscal policy and government debt management (with a number of joint papers with Albert Marcet). More recently his work has been on longevity and focusing on the positive economic, social and personal effects that arise from the fact that on average we are living longer and healthier for longer. This focus on the positive aspects of longevity is an offset to the focus on the negative aspects of an ageing society. This longevity agenda is set out in his co-authored books The 100 Year Life ‚Äì Living and Working in an Age of Longevity (2016) and The New Long Life (2020). In 2019 the ESRC awarded him a ¬£1mn grant to investigate the economics of a longevity agenda. He is also the co-founder of The Longevity Forum.

Hamilton (February 23, 1888 ‚Äì May 27, 1946) was an American businessman. He is most notable for his work as a senor executive of the Weyerhaeuser wood products company and a named partner of the Booz Allen Hamilton management and information technology consulting firm. Biography Carl Lewis Hamilton was born in Dubuque, Iowa on February 23, 1888, the son of Dr. Charles H. Hamilton and Mathilda Heberling (Lewis) Hamilton. He graduated from Dubuque High School in 1906, from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor of science degree in forestry in 1911. During his time in college, Hamilton worked as an agent for a West Virginia timber, land, and rock company. In the years immediately following his graduation, he was the general sales manager for a Minnesota lumber distributor, and manager for a lumber company with operations in Costa Rica. In 1915, Hamilton joined Weyerhaeuser. Originally the general manager of the Weyerhaeuser Forest Products subsidiary, he advanced through the ranks to become vice president and general manager of the Weyerhaeuser General Timber Service Company. Hamilton joined Edwin G. Booz & Fry Surveys as a partner in 1935. During World War II, Hamilton led Booz & Fry's successful effort to obtain management services work in the defense industry, including personnel management for the United States Cartridge Company in St. Louis. Hamilton's most lasting legacy at Booz, Allen & Hamilton was the creation and implementation of the company's initial code of ethics. His effort to codify the importance of corporate integrity and fair behavior was one of the first adopted by a U.S. corporation, and became a model that many other businesses emulated. During Hamilton's tenure, the Booz & Fry company became first Booz, Fry, Allen & Hamilton. After George Fry left the company in 1942, it became Booz, Allen & Hamilton. In the mid 1970s, the company was renamed as Booz Allen Hamilton. Death and burial Hamilton died of a heart attack at his home in Winnetka, Illinois on May 27, 1946. He was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. Family Hamilton was the husband of Marjorie Atwood. They were the parents of son Charles (1917-1995) and daughter Marjorie (b. 1918), the wife of William Noble Lane (1917-1978).

No one was ever convicted of the lynching. Smith's memory was honored in June 2017 with a plaque at St. Anselm Episcopal Church in Nashville; two other lynching victims from Nashville have also been memorialized there. Lynching Nolensville is about 22 miles from Nashville. At 1 a.m. on December 13, 1924, a white grocer named Ike Eastwood reportedly heard noises outside his house, grabbed a gun, and found an African-American man, Jim Smith, in his garage. He thought Smith was stealing spark plugs from his car. Eastwood shot Smith, but the man was joined by his nephew, Samuel Smith, age 15, who shot and wounded Eastwood. The grocer fired back, wounding the younger Smith as well. Samuel Smith ran away, and tried to hitch-hike to Nashville. The next morning, Sam Smith was arrested 100 yards from Eastwood's house. The police took him to Nashville's General Hospital for treatment, where he was chained to his bed. His uncle Jim Smith was captured by police at the garage, and was taken to the county jail. At midnight on December 15, 1924, Samuel Smith was seized by a group of six or seven masked and armed men from his hospital room in Nashville. They were joined by a larger masked mob outside the hospital. Smith was taken to Frank Hill Road in Nolensville, where he had been arrested near Eastwood's house. He was stripped, hanged from a tree, and riddled with bullets. The lynching was watched by onlookers in thirty cars, many of whom shot guns as soon as Smith was hanged, before they drove away. At 12:50 a.m., an unidentified individual called The Tennessean newspaper and reported the lynching. Smith's body was found hanging from an oak tree by W. F. Fly, a farmer who had been woken by the gunshots, at 1 a.m. Shortly after, the hospital superintendent called the police, and County Sheriff Robert Riley drove to Nolensville, where he saw the hanged and shot youth. Riley was joined by county coroner J. R. Allen, and several police officers. They left the body hanging at the scene, about 200 yards north of the Williamson county line along the Nolensville Pike. The Nashville Tennessean noted that it was reminiscent of the 1892 lynching of Ephraim Grizzard. The lynching was denounced by Nashville Mayor Hilary Ewing Howse. Prominent city residents wrote an open letter to Governor Austin Peay and Sheriff Riley asking them to bring the perpetrators of the lynching to justice. The Nashville Chamber of Commerce offered a reward of $5,000 to identify and arrest the lynchers. Members of the Vine Street Temple condemned the lynching, and leaders of the Agora Club, an African-American club, wondered if they should encourage fellow blacks to move to other parts of the country. An article in The Leaf-Chronicle noted, \\"Such open defiance and violation of law cannot escape detection unless public opinion in that community approves it. Somebody knows who did it and somebody will tell unless somebody is afraid or unwilling to tell.\\" No one was ever convicted of the lynching. According to the Tennessee Tribune, this is \\"believed to be the last lynching\\" in the Nashville area. Fisk University Dean Reavis L. Mitchell Jr. said, \\"There may have been others, but there‚Äôs no public record.\\" Legacy In June 2017, a worship service was held at the chapel at Fisk University Memorial Chapel, entitled \\"Reclaiming Hope Through Remembering\\", in memory of lynching victims Sam Smith and brothers Ephraim and Henry Grizzard, killed in 1892. In addition, a plaque was installed in their memories in St. Anselm's Episcopal Church in Nashville. The ceremonies were related to three years of work by a diocesan task force working on policy and community discussions related to racism in Nashville. The services were open to all the public.

Guided by the importance of cell-autonomous immunity as the sole defender of unicellular organisms, Randow has made contributions to our understanding of host-pathogen interactions. He is an EMBO member and received a Wellcome Trust investigator award in 2014.  Education  Randow grew up in Germany, where he was educated at Goetheschule in Pritzwalk and Humbold-University in Berlin. He obtained his PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) in 1997 under the guidance of Hans-Dieter Volk.  Career and Research  Between 1997 and 2002 Randow undertook postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Brian Seed at Harvard Medical School. In 2003 he became group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. His work revealed novel principles of cell-autonomous immunity in human tissues, namely that human cells activate anti-bacterial autophagy when sensing endomembrane damage and that cells convert cytosol-invading bacteria into anti-bacterial signalling platforms by coating the bacterial surface with specific host proteins. Randow's work has provided important insights into the mechanism of anti-bacterial autophagy. He discovered a new pathway of cell-autonomous defence relying on galectin-8 as the receptor for membrane-damage caused by cytosol-invading bacteria., NDP52 as the first anti-bacterial autophagy receptor, and TBK1 as specifying the sites of anti-bacterial autophagy. Because the galectin-8 pathway detects membrane damage rather than the invading pathogen per se, its importance likely reaches well beyond anti- bacterial defence, including protection against viruses and tauopathies. Randow's discovery of the E3 ubiquitin ligase LUBAC attaching M1-linked ubiquitin chains directly onto cytosol-invading bacteria, thereby activating NF-Œ∫B and autophagy, revealed another novel concept of cell-autonomous immunity, namely that cells transform bacteria into pro-inflammatory and anti- bacterial signalling platforms by coating their surface with ubiquitin. His recent demonstration of guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) encapsulating cytosolic bacteria, thereby preventing the infection of neighbouring cells, revealed that host cells generate a distinct variety of polyvalent protein coats on cytosolic bacteria as a means to antagonize bacteria and strengthen the host defence  Awards  * 2018 Member, European Molecular Biology Organisation (EMBO)  References  Category:German immunologists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Felix Armin Randow"},{"id":"57313841","text":"Youri Roulaux (born 19 May 1999) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays for Roda JC Kerkrade, as a goalkeeper.

A specialist in Modern Irish Gaelic (Nua-Ghaeilge), Wigger has published many articles on different aspects of the modern language. He is a fluent speaker of the Connemara dialect. He also studies Hungarian, Portuguese and Arabic. He is closely associated with the Studienhaus f√ºr Keltische Sprachen und Kulturen - SKSK, at the University of Bonn. Career Wigger studied Irish Gaelic under Hans Hartmann in the 1960s at the University of Hamburg. He taught general linguistics at the University of Wuppertal until 2009. After completing a thesis entitled Nominalformen im Conamara-Irischen in 1970, he published many other studies, especially in Modern Irish Gaelic. In addition, he has published many Irish texts based on sound recordings. He revised the German edition of the Gaelic textbook Lehrbuch der irischen Sprache, with M√≠che√°l √ì Siadhail (1980). He joined two research initiatives, one on Gaelic dialects (1995‚Äì2000) and one on the Irish Gaelic language (2005‚Äì2008), funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (the German Research Foundation). It was at Wigger's initiative that the SKSK, (Studienhaus f√ºr Keltische Sprachen und Kulturen) was established. In 2012, he made a film for TG4 about his former teacher Hans Hartman, a man who recorded many native Gaelic speakers in Connemara in the late 1930s and broadcast Nazi propaganda in Gaelic from Germany during World War II. Wigger says in the film that he had high regard for Hartman as a teacher, but he would have abandoned him on the spot had he known that Hartman was a former member of the Nazi Party. Wigger has been instrumental in bringing to the attention of Irish academics and researchers the importance of general-register speech (as opposed to high-register speech, as found in traditional storytelling and other such genres).

Some YouTube personalities also have corporate sponsors who pay for product placement in their clips or production of online videos. These content- creators are often considered to be \\"influencers\\".  Etymology  The name \\"YouTuber\\" refers to individual(s) whose main or only platforms are YouTube channel(s), personalized subpages of the YouTube video sharing platform. History YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim created the first YouTube channel \\"Jawed\\" on April 23, 2005. The Internet domain name \\"\`www.youtube.com\`\\" was activated on February 14, 2005 by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, when they worked for PayPal. The first YouTube channel \\"Jawed\\" was created on April 23, 2005 PDT (April 24, 2005 UTC) by the YouTube co-founder of the same name. He uploaded the first YouTube video, a short vlog clip titled Me at the zoo, on the same day. In October 2005, YouTube introduced the ability to subscribe to YouTube channels. The New York Times claims that most YouTube videos up until 2006 were focused on different forms of talent, citing back- flip stunts, lip-syncing, and other people's talents being uploaded via clips such as clips of Saturday Night Live. By June 2006, recognized Hollywood and music industry firms had begun to establish formal business ties with \\"homegrown\\" YouTube talent‚Äîthe first believed to be comedian blogger Brooke \\"Brookers\\" Brodack (through Carson Daly), then singer Justin Bieber (through Usher), and physician-become-political satirist Bassem Youssef (through an Egyptian television network). In 2007 YouTube started its \\"Partner Program\\", an ad-revenue-sharing arrangement that allowed for YouTubers to make money off the videos they uploaded to YouTube. By October 2015, there were more than 17,000 YouTube channels with more than 100,000 subscribers, and nearly 1,500 with more than a million. These numbers have grown to almost 44,000 channels with at least 250,000 subscribers in January 2019.  Influence  PewDiePie, the platform's second most-subscribed channel, and most subscribed YouTuber, in July 2019. According to multiple studies, YouTubers have become an important source of information and entertainment for the millennial and Generation Z-generations. Influential YouTubers are frequently described as microcelebrities. Since YouTube is widely conceived as a bottom-up social media video platform, microcelebrities do not appear to be involved with the established and commercial system of celebrity culture but rather appear self- governed and independent. This appearance, in turn, leads to YouTubers being seen as more relatable and authentic, also fostered by the direct connection between artist and viewer using the medium of YouTube. These microcelebrities often communicate with their viewers which gives a more friendly outlook. The content- creators of YouTube (YouTubers) create content on a wide range of variety including vlogs, instructive, how to, informative videos, and more. In a 2014 survey conducted by the University of Southern California among 13-18 year-olds in the United States on whether 10 YouTube celebrities or 10 traditional celebrities were more influential, YouTube personalities took the first five spots of the ranking, with Smosh ranking as most influential. When repeated in 2015, the survey found six YouTubers on the first ranks, with KSI ranked as most influential. Several prominent YouTubers and their influence were subjects for scientific studies, such as Zoella and PewDiePie. Because of this level of influence, Robert Hovden argued for the creation of a new index similar to the g-index and h-index to evaluate a person's output and impact on YouTube.  Commercial success  YouTubers can earn revenue off of Google AdSense. Additionally, they can supplement their income through affiliate links, merchandising, and 3rd party memberships such as ones on Patreon. Popular channels have garnered corporate sponsors, who pay to be included in the videos. In 2018, Walmart, Nordstrom, and others sought YouTube stars as influencers. In 2015, NME stated that \\"vlogging has become big business.\\" In 2015, Forbes reported that Felix Kjellberg, known on YouTube as PewDiePie, had earned $12 million in 2014, more than some popular actors such as Cameron Diaz or Gwyneth Paltrow. Additionally, YouTube stars have crossed over to other media platforms including late-night television such as Canadian Youtuber Lilly Singh, who hosts the talk show A Little Late with Lilly Singh on NBC.

Spun off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando P√©rez, Project Jupyter supports execution environments in several dozen languages. Project Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python and R, and also a homage to Galileo's notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter. Project Jupyter has developed and supported the interactive computing products Jupyter Notebook, JupyterHub, and JupyterLab, the next-generation version of Jupyter Notebook.  History  In 2014, Fernando P√©rez announced a spin-off project from IPython called Project Jupyter. IPython continues to exist as a Python shell and a kernel for Jupyter, while the notebook and other language-agnostic parts of IPython moved under the Jupyter name. Jupyter is language agnostic and it supports execution environments (aka kernels) in several dozen languages among which are Julia, R, Haskell, Ruby, and of course Python (via the IPython kernel). In 2015, GitHub and the Jupyter Project announced native rendering of Jupyter notebooks file format (.ipynb files) on the GitHub platform.  Philosophy  Project Jupyter's operating philosophy is to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages via the development of open-source software. According to the Project Jupyter website, \\"Jupyter will always be 100% open-source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license\\".  Products  = Jupyter Notebook = Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating Jupyter notebook documents. The \\"notebook\\" term can colloquially make reference to many different entities, mainly the Jupyter web application, Jupyter Python web server, or Jupyter document format depending on context. A Jupyter Notebook document is a JSON document, following a versioned schema, and containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text (using Markdown), mathematics, plots and rich media, usually ending with the \\".ipynb\\" extension. A Jupyter Notebook can be converted to a number of open standard output formats (HTML, presentation slides, LaTeX, PDF, ReStructuredText, Markdown, Python) through \\"Download As\\" in the web interface, via the nbconvert library or \\"jupyter nbconvert\\" command line interface in a shell. To simplify visualisation of Jupyter notebook documents on the web, the nbconvert library is provided as a service through NbViewer which can take a URL to any publicly available notebook document, convert it to HTML on the fly and display it to the user. Jupyter Notebook interface Jupyter Notebook provides a browser-based REPL built upon a number of popular open-source libraries: * IPython * √òMQ * Tornado (web server) * jQuery * Bootstrap (front-end framework) * MathJax Jupyter Notebook can connect to many kernels to allow programming in many languages. By default Jupyter Notebook ships with the IPython kernel. As of the 2.3 release (October 2014), there are currently 49 Jupyter-compatible kernels for many programming languages, including Python, R, Julia and Haskell. The Notebook interface was added to IPython in the 0.12 release (December 2011), renamed to Jupyter notebook in 2015 (IPython 4.0 ‚Äì Jupyter 1.0). Jupyter Notebook is similar to the notebook interface of other programs such as Maple, Mathematica, and SageMath, a computational interface style that originated with Mathematica in the 1980s. According to The Atlantic, Jupyter interest overtook the popularity of the Mathematica notebook interface in early 2018. = Jupyter kernels = A Jupyter kernel is a program responsible for handling various types of requests (code execution, code completions, inspection), and providing a reply. Kernels talk to the other components of Jupyter using ZeroMQ over the network, and thus can be on the same or remote machines. Unlike many other Notebook-like interfaces, in Jupyter, kernels are not aware that they are attached to a specific document, and can be connected to many clients at once. Usually kernels allow execution of only a single language, but there are a couple of exceptions. = JupyterHub = JupyterHubhttps://jupyter.org/hub is a multi- user server for Jupyter Notebooks. It is designed to support many users by spawning, managing, and proxying many singular Jupyter Notebook servers. While JupyterHub requires managing servers, third-party services like Jupyo provide an alternative to JupyterHub by hosting and managing multi-user Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. = JupyterLab = JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter. It offers all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface. The first stable release was announced on February 20, 2018. = Jupyter{Book} = Jupyter Book is an open source project for building books and documents from computational material. This allows the user to construct the content in a mixture of Markdown an extended version of Markdown called MyST, Maths & Equations using MathJax, Jupyter Notebooks, reStructuredText, the output of running Jupyter Notebooks at build time, etc. Multiple output formats can be produced currently Single Files & Multipage HTML web pages and PDF files. = nbgrader = nbgrader is a tool for creating and grading (marking) assignments in Jupyter notebooks. It allows the instructor to create assignments that include coding exercises in python or any other supported kernel and text responses. The submitted assignments can be automatically marked, manually scored or a mixture of both.  Industry adoption  The Jupyter Notebook has become a popular user interface for cloud computing, and major cloud providers have adopted the Jupyter Notebook or derivative tools as a frontend interface for cloud users. Examples include Amazon's SageMaker Notebooks, Google's Colaboratory and Microsoft's Azure Notebook. = Colaboratory = Colaboratory (also known as Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud and stores its notebooks on Google Drive. Colab was originally an internal Google project; an attempt was made to open source all the code and work more directly upstream, leading to the development of the \\"Open in Colab\\" Google Chrome extension, but this eventually ended, and Colab development continued internally. the Colaboratory UI only allows you to create notebooks with Python 2 and Python 3 kernels; however, if you have an existing notebook whose kernelspec is IR or Swift, that will work, since both R and Swift are installed in the container. Julia language can also work on Colab (with e.g. Python and GPUs; Google's tensor processing units also work with Julia on Colab).  Media coverage  * On February 11, 2016, the LIGO collaboration announced the first observation of gravitational waves. The collaboration released the raw scientific data along with Jupyter Notebooks containing Python code to process the data and reproduce the figures from the discovery paper. * On April 5, 2018, The Atlantic published an article entitled The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete, which discussed the role of the Jupyter Notebook and the Mathematica notebook in the future of scientific publishing. This article led to responses from prominent scientists and academics, including economist Paul Romer.  Grants and awards  * In 2012, Fernando P√©rez received the Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software for his work on IPython, the precursor to Project Jupyter. * In 2013, the IPython team received a $1.15 million grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation which funded early work that led to the creation of Project Jupyter. * In 2015, Project Jupyter was awarded a joint $6 million grant from The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which funded work that led to expanded capabilities of the core Jupyter tools, as well as the creation of JupyterLab. * On May 2nd, 2018, the steering committee of Project Jupyter was awarded the 2017 ACM Software System Award, an annual award that honors people or an organization \\"for developing a software system that has had a lasting influence, reflected in contributions to concepts, in commercial acceptance, or both\\".

For assassinating him she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 29 October 1943 by decree of the Supreme Soviet.  Early life  Mazanik was born on 2 March 1914 to a Belarusian peasant family in the village of Poddegtyarnaya of the Minsk Governorate, then part of the Russian Empire. Her education was average for the time, as she graduated from only six grades of school before leaving in 1931 to work as a waitress at the dining room of the Belarussian SSR Council of People's Commissars. Soon she married a man by the name of Boleslav Antonovich Tarletsky, who was a chauffeur and an employee of the NKVD. In 1935 she gave birth to a son, but he only lived for a year and a half. After giving birth to her first son she changed jobs to work at the gym of the Belarusian Council of People's Commissars. In 1939 she gave birth to another son, this time very prematurely, and he did not survive. That same year she went back to her previous job working as a waitress. After the Germans took control of Minsk, Mazanik infiltrated a Wehrmacht unit using the pseudonym of Galina, but later moved on to working as a waitress at a dining hall and casino for German officers until she was recruited to work at the mansion of Wilhelm Kube in June 1943.  Assassination of Wilhelm Kube  = Planning and preparation = By the time Mazanik had begun working as a maid in the Kube mansion, partisans had already been planning his assassination. After receiving authorization from Moscow the partisan detachments in the Minsk area began preparing to liquidate him. On 22 July 1943 they detonated a bomb in a Minsk theater, killing around 70 German soldiers; however, Kube had left the theater just minutes before the bomb went off. On 6 September 1943 after partisans attacked a banquet for German officers they managed to kill 36 high ranking officials and officers, but because Kube was not present for unknown reasons they did not kill him that day, nor did they when they attempted to ambush him on a road he often traveled on. On 8 August 1943, Tatyana Kalita, one of the maids who had worked for Kube, introduced Mazanik to other members of a partisan unit tasked with killing Kube, including Nadezhda Troyan under the pseudonym \\"Kanskaya\\" and a man named Artur working for the partisan detachment known as \\"Dyadi Koli\\". In a series of meetings, Mazanik agreed to kill Kube, either using an explosive or poison, but not before waiting for her sister Valentina Shchutskoi to confirm the identity Mariya Osipova and Nikolai Pokhlebayev, who had introduced Osipova to Mazanik while Troyan was trying to get her to agree to a task. Before carrying out the assassination they made plans for her family to be evacuated from Minsk because they would undoubtedly face retaliation. She then met with several other partisans, and after a few bumps in the road Mariya Osipova provided Mazanik with a bomb and a poison capsule in case she was caught. Originally they planned to poison Kube with arsenic, but Mazanik did not want to do that because there were children in Kube's mansion who might eat the food they would poison. = Execution of the plot = On the night of 21 September 1943 Mazanik, with the assistance of her sister Valentina, set the bomb to go off in 24 hours. At 6:30 the next morning she wrapped the small bomb in a handkerchief and placed it in her purse before leaving to observe a mass execution. Meanwhile, Valentina and the rest of her family were packing their possessions into carts and leaving Minsk for partisan-controlled areas of the forest. The guards standing at the entrance to Kube's mansion did not pay much attention to the maids they knew worked for Kube, but nevertheless tried to see what was under the handkerchief in Mazanik's bag; however, she managed to stop them from lifting it enough to see the bomb by interrupting them by saying it held a gift for Kube's wife Anita. After entering the house Mazanik went to the bathroom and hid the bomb under her dress. At 10:00 am Kube left for his job while his older children attended school. Anita and her youngest child went on a shopping trip, leaving only Mazanik and one other servant in the house; she then entered Kube's bedroom and planted the small bomb under his bed between the mattress and springs. At about the same time Mazanik's family were leaving the city for the forest. After planting the bomb Mazanik left the apartment, saying she was going to go to the doctor for a toothache. At 1:20 am on 22 September 1943, the bomb under Kube's bed went off forty minutes early, killing him. His pregnant wife was not hurt because she had been sleeping in a different bed at the time. A truck had evacuated Mazanik from Minsk and she was never apprehended by the Nazis, but over 1,000 people in Minsk were forced to dig their own mass grave and were shot in collective punishment inflicted on the city. Late at night on 12 October all of the conspirators in the plot were flown out of Belarus to Moscow, and after writing the final report on the mission the partisans were interrogated by Vsevolod Merkulov, Bogdan Kobulov, and Fyodor Kuznetsov at the Lubyanka. Later she learned that the NKVD wanted to kill her and identify another woman as the assassin, but they didn't. On 29 October 1943 the three main conspirators, Mazanik, Troyan, and Osipova, were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. = Other parties who claimed responsibility = Soviet intelligence agencies had assigned the task of killing Kube to twelve different partisan units, several leaders of which assumed that their members were the ones who executed the plot when they got news of his death. One leader of a partisan unit in Belarus, Stepan Kazantsev, claimed that a prisoner in the Minsk ghetto by the name of Leo Lieberman had planted the bomb under Kube's bed. While Lieberman did work at Kube's mansion, Kazantsev's claims that Lieberman was the assassin did not hold up to scrutiny. Another partisan group, nicknamed \\"The Avengers\\" claimed they were responsible and that Mazanik was a member of their unit, but this was considered erroneous.  Postwar life  Mazanik did not remarry after the end of the Second World War. In 1946 she joined the Communist Party before graduating from the Minsk Pedagogical Institute in 1952. She later worked as the deputy director of the Main Library of the Academy of Sciences of the Byelorussian SSR. She died on 7 April 1996 and was buried in the Eastern Cemetery of Minsk.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. History The first settler in what is now Pleasant Ridge was Virgil Rose, who purchased a 400-acre portion of land centered on the Ten Mile Road - Woodward Avenue intersection. In the late 19th century, the Rose family heirs sold a portion of the tract west of Woodward to Alfred F. Wilcox, who developed a large estate in 1900 and in 1906 began platting a subdivision. The Rose family continued to own the land east of Woodward until 1914, when they platted the LaBelle Heights and Hamilton Woods subdivisions which include the majority of this historic district. The first houses were built in 1915-16, and in 1919 Pleasant Ridge, on both east and west sides of Woodward, was incorporated as a village. Development boomed in the 1920s, and a number of developers and building contractors worked in the area. The most prominent of these was Walter Gehrke, who established an office in the district in 1926. The village incorporated as a city in 1927. The Pleasant Ridge East Historic District became home to a range of business, professional, and middle class workers, including teachers, architects, art directors, auditors, editors, brokers, accountants, brokers, metallurgists, electrical engineers, chemists, dentists, pharmacists, and physicians. Description The Pleasant Ridge East Historic District is a primarily single-family home residential district, with only a few commercial properties along Woodward and Main Street. The neighborhoods are remarkably intact and cohesive, with homes representing a variety of architectural styles popular during the 1920s and 1930s, including colonials, English cottages, bungalows and Craftsman structures. The district's largest homes tend to be located along the block or two closest to Woodward, with the ones most modest in scale farther away, near the railroad line.

Born into slavery, her freedom was purchased and she became the owner of the Royal Naval Hotel, a brothel which catered to the itinerant military personnel on the island of Barbados. She was one of the first mulatto women to operate a business in the colony. Rising to a position of prominence, her story has been told and retold in Bajan history, with the narrative being shaped by different eras. At times her biography was used as a cautionary tale, while in other eras it was used to illustrate empowerment. Recent scholarship has focused on archival records in an attempt to provide a clearer picture of African and African-descended women's lives during the slave economy. Early life Born Rachael Lauder around 1753 in Bridgetown, Barbados, in the colony of the British West Indies to an enslaved woman and William Lauder, a white Scottish schoolmaster. J. W. Orderson wrote a novel, Creoleana in 1855, which gives details of her life. Orderson, who inherited the newspaper, Barbados Mercury, from his father John Orderson, would have been a teenager during Polgreen's life and it is probable from evidence of advertisements placed in his paper by Polgreen that the two knew each other. Other than archival records, a lithograph, and Orderson's stereotyped and sexualized retelling of her life with its intent to make a moral statement against miscegenation, little is known from her own perspective of her life. In Orderson's narrative, she was purchased by Captain Thomas Pringle, an officer in the Royal Navy, to rescue her from her sexually abusive father. Pringle and Lauder had become lovers and after he purchased her, he manumitted her and set her up in a house in Bridgetown. Career After settling Lauder in the house, Pringle left the island returning to his military career. Lauder took his name, and later took the surname Polgreen, though it is unclear whether that was due to another relationship. She turned the house Pringle purchased for her into a hotel, which also served as a brothel, offering sexual services to the itinerant military personnel traveling through Bridgetown. After an incident in which Prince William Henry visited her hotel, wrecking it in a drunken spree, and threw Polgreen from her chair into the street, Orderson tells that she sent the prince (later King William IV) a hefty bill for damages. She named the establishment the Royal Naval Hotel, referencing the prince, as well as the navy, as her prestigious clients. Whether the story of the encounter is legend or not, is unknown, though an advertisement in the Barbados Gazette in 1789, offered a reward from Polgreen for the return of several items. The publication dates coincide with the prince's visit to the island and might indicate that there is some truth to the novel's depiction of events. Archival records from the Privy Council minutes of 1791 paint a portrait of Polgreen as having a violent temper and of abusing her own slaves. The Barbados Slave Code allowed slave owners to punish their slaves with extreme violence, nor was her running of a brothel controversial. Marisa J. Fuentes, a scholar who studies enslaved women of the Caribbean, has evaluated how formerly enslaved women became dependent upon the slave economy and thus perpetuated the system of exploitation of others. For example, in 1780 Polgreen sold a woman named Joanna to a soldier, Joseph Haycock, who then manumitted her. Unable to support herself as a free woman, three years later, Joanna indentured herself to Polgreen for twelve years in exchange for clothing, food and drink. Likewise, though Polgreen was able to amass property and gain an economic position similar to many white business people, she was only able to do that in an endeavor that would not have been considered respectable for her white counterparts. Polgreen accrued an estate worth over ¬£2,900, which included houses, goods, furnishings, and thirty-eight slaves. Comparable to an estate of a moderately well-to-do white person at the time, her wealth bound her to an affluent social network, allowing her burial in the Anglican cemetery. Per the terms of her will, she manumitted a slave named Joanna, and transferred ownership of two of her other slaves to Joanna. She also freed a slave named Princess and four mulatto children. The rest of her slaves were bequeathed to \\"William Firebrace and his female relatives, William Stevens, and Captain Thomas Pringle\\". It is unclear from the will whether the freedom of Joanna discounted her earlier manumission or whether it terminated her contract of indenture. Thomas Rowlandson, an English artist, printed a lithograph of Polgreen in 1796. The caricature depicts Polgreen sitting in front of her establishment, which is adorned with a sign proclaiming \\"Pawpaw Sweetmeats & Pickles of all Sorts by Rachel PP\\". Behind her and to her left in the work is a young woman, clad in a low-cut dress, facing a portly white man wearing tattered garments. To her right, is a white British military officer peering from a window. In 1958, the Journal of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society contained an anonymously written article analyzing the painting. The author claimed that the painting was an allegorical reference to Polgreen's life, with the woman in the background representing Polgreen as a young woman, the tattered man depicting her master- father-abuser, and the officer illustrating her savior Pringle. Fuentes noted that figures, as well as the sign, allude to sexuality, as is typical for works by Rowlandson. The double entendre of the words both indicate that Polgreen was involved in the market economy, but also refer to the consumption of women's bodies (delectable fruit) by men (phallic symbolism). Death and legacy Polgreen was buried in the churchyard of the Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels in Bridgetown on 23 July 1791. Her hotel was taken over by Nancy Clarke, who ran it successfully for a decade, before turning it over to Carolyn Barrow (also sometimes Charlotte Barrow). It continued in business until it was destroyed in a fire in 1821. Her legacy has been used repeatedly in Bajan historiography to represent different images at different times. In the nineteenth century, her story was exploited as a cautionary tale for the dangers of not curtailing the sexuality of black women. In the post-colonial period, Polgreen's story was used by elites to foster a sense of the benefits to be gained by accommodation and loyalty to Britain. Still later, she began to symbolize the power that black women were able to wield in resistance to slavery. Current scholarship is reevaluating her story once again to ascertain how the complexities of her life, such as her own sexual abuse and then sexual exploitation of others, living under the threat of punishment and then domination of others, interacted, keeping in mind that the discourse is colored by the facts that she was an illiterate woman of color and did not tell her own story.

It is the most common subtype of Castleman disease, symptoms are typically mild, abnormalities on blood tests are uncommon, organ dysfunction is uncommon, and surgical treatment is curative in the majority of patients. The cause of UCD is not known. Castleman disease is named after Benjamin Castleman, who first described the disease in 1956. The Castleman Disease Collaborative Network is the largest organization focused on the disease and is involved in research, awareness, and patient support.  Signs and symptoms  UCD commonly presents without symptoms; however, people with the disease may experience enlarged lymph nodes in a single lymph node region or report symptoms related to compression of neighboring structures by enlarged lymph nodes, such as difficulty breathing and pain or pressure in the abdomen or chest. Systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue), extravascular fluid accumulation (peripheral edema, ascites, pleural effusions), and enlargement of the liver and/or spleen, all of which are commonly seen in HHV-8-associated MCD and iMCD, are uncommon in UCD. = Associated diseases = UCD is associated with increased risk of paraneoplastic pemphigus.  Causes  UCD has no known causes or risk factors. Cases of Castleman disease running in families have been reported; however, no causative genetic variants have been identified  Mechanism  The mechanism of UCD is poorly understood. Most published research supports a growth of abnormal immune system cells (neoplasm) as the most likely cause of UCD, but this has not been conclusively demonstrated or fully characterized. Other proposed mechanisms include viral infections and autoimmune processes. Because surgical removal of affected lymph nodes in UCD is typically curative and recurrence is rare, it is believed that the pathologic process is limited to affected lymph nodes. Unlike HHV-8-associated MCD, which is caused by the HHV-8 virus, UCD has not been associated with HHV-8 infection1 When findings typically seen in MCD, such as systemic symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, they are likely related to increased levels of molecules that stimulate the immune system (cytokines), such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). Systemic symptoms and laboratory abnormalities may be associated with the presence of plasmacytic features on microscopic analysis of affected lymph node tissue. There have been no reported cases of UCD transforming into iMCD. Diagnosis UCD is diagnosed based on patient history, physical exam, laboratory testing, radiologic imaging, and microscopic analysis (histology) of biopsied tissue from an enlarged lymph node. There are no widely accepted diagnostic criteria for UCD; however, diagnosis generally requires enlargement of lymph nodes limited to a single region of lymph nodes (typically confirmed with radiologic imaging), biopsy of an enlarged lymph node demonstrating characteristic features of Castleman disease, and exclusion of other diseases that can mimic UCD. = Classification = Castleman disease describes a group of at least 3 distinct disorders‚Äîunicentric Castleman disease (UCD), human herpesvirus 8 associated multicentric Castleman disease (HHV-8-associated MCD), and idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD). Identifying the correct subtype of the disease is important, as the three disorders vary significantly in symptoms, clinical findings, disease mechanism, treatment approach, and prognosis. * In Unicentric Castleman disease enlarged lymph nodes with characteristic microscopic findings are present in only a single lymph node region. * In the multicentric subtypes of Castleman disease, enlarged lymph nodes with characteristic findings are present in multiple lymph node regions. The multicentric variants of Castleman disease are further classified by known causes of the disease.  HHV-8-associated MCD is caused by uncontrolled infection with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8, also known as Kaposi sarcoma- associated herpesvirus).  In idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) the cause of the disease is unknown (idiopathic). Testing for HHV-8 must be negative to diagnose iMCD. = Medical imaging = Radiologic imaging shows an enlarged lymph node or multiple enlarged lymph nodes in a single region, which are typically 18F-fluorodoxyglucose (FDG) avid on positron- emission tomography (PET). = Laboratory testing = Laboratory testing is typically normal, including blood counts, metabolic tests, and inflammatory markers; however, in some people with UCD, laboratory testing may show abnormalities more commonly seen in HHV-8-associated MCD or iMCD. These abnormal tests include elevated C-Reactive Protein, decreased hemoglobin levels (anemia), low albumin levels, elevated creatinine (kidney dysfunction), increased immunoglobulin levels, abnormal platelet counts, and elevations of molecules involved in inflammation (cytokines), such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). = Pathology = The microscopic appearance (histology) of biopsied tissue from an enlarged lymph node must demonstrate a constellation of features consistent with Castleman disease. There are three patterns of characteristic histologic features associated with UCD: * Hyaline vascular - regressed germinal centers, follicular dendritic cell prominence or displasia, hypervascularity in interfollicular regions, sclerotic vessels, prominent mantle zones with an ‚Äúonion-skin‚Äù appearance. * Plasmacytic ‚Äì increased number of follicles with large hyperplastic germinal centers and sheetlike plasmacytosis (increased number plasma cells). * Mixed - features of both hyaline vascular and plasmacytic patterns UCD most commonly demonstrates hyaline vascular features; however, plasmacytic features or a mixture of both hyaline vascular and plasmacytic features may also be seen in UCD lymph nodes. The clinical utility of subtyping Castleman disease by histologic features is uncertain, as histologic subtypes do not consistently predict disease severity or treatment response. Staining with latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1), a marker for HHV-8 infection, must be negative to diagnose UCD. = Diseases to be excluded = Diagnosis of UCD requires ruling out other diseases that can present with enlarged lymph nodes limited to a single region of lymph nodes and histologic findings similar to UCD on microscopic analysis of biopsied lymph nodes. This include infectious causes, such as toxoplsasma lymphadenitis, and cancers, including Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, and plasmacytoma.  Treatment  Due to the rarity of the disease, data regarding treatment is limited to observational case series and case reports. No randomized trials have been conducted comparing treatment options for UCD. Complete surgical removal of the enlarged lymph node or region of lymph nodes is considered the gold standard treatment for UCD and is typically curative, with resolution of symptoms and lab abnormalities attributable to the disease. Occasionally, surgical removal of an enlarged lymph node may be prohibitively high risk at the time of diagnosis due to large size or proximity to critical structures. This is more common with lymph nodes located deep in the chest, which may be close to major airways and blood vessels. In these cases, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive medications, catheter embolization of blood vessels supplying the lymph node, and/or radiation therapy may be used to shrink the involved lymph nodes, potentially reducing the risk of surgery to acceptable levels. If surgical risk remains too high after treatment to shrink the enlarged lymph node, treatments used to reduce the size of the lymph node may be continued to control symptoms related to the disease. = Follow-up = After initiation of treatment, patients are regularly evaluated for recurrence of disease and response to treatment with laboratory testing and radiologic imaging.  Prognosis  Most people with UCD who undergo complete surgical resection of enlarged lymph nodes achieve long-term disease-free survival, with an observed 10-year mortality of 4% in the largest case series to date.  Epidemiology  There are approximately 5000-6000 new cases of UCD diagnosed per year in the United States, making it the most common form of Castleman disease. UCD can occur at any age, but the median age at presentation is approximately 35 years old. There is a slightly increased incidence of UCD in women. There have been no published epidemiologic studies of Castleman disease outside of the United States; however, there is no evidence of increased or decreased incidence of Castleman disease in specific regions or ethnicities.  History  Castleman disease was first described by Dr. Benjamin Castleman in 1956. World Castleman Disease Day was established in 2018 and is held every year on July 23. = Organizations = The Castleman Disease Collaborative Network was founded in 2012 and is the largest organization focused on Castleman disease. It is a global collaborative network involved in research, awareness, and patient support.

People with iMCD have enlarged lymph nodes in multiple regions and often have flu-like symptoms, abnormal findings on blood tests, and dysfunction of vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and bone marrow. iMCD has features often found in autoimmune diseases and cancers, but the underlying disease mechanism is unknown. Treatment for iMCD may involve the use of a variety of medications, including immunosuppressants and chemotherapy. Castleman disease was named after Dr. Benjamin Castleman, who first described the disease in 1956. The Castleman Disease Collaborative Network is the largest organization focused on the disease and is involved in research, awareness, and patient support.  Signs and symptoms  Patients with iMCD may experience enlarged lymph nodes in multiple lymph node regions; systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, unintended weight loss, fatigue); enlargement of the liver and/or spleen; extravascular fluid accumulation in the extremities (edema), abdomen (ascites), or lining of the lungs (pleural effusion); lung symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath; and skin findings such as cherry hemangiomas.  Causes  The cause of iMCD is not known and no risk factors have been identified. Genetic variants have been observed in cases of Castleman disease; however, no genetic variant has been validated as disease causing. Unlike HHV-8-associated MCD, iMCD is not caused by uncontrolled HHV-8 infection.  Mechanism  The disease mechanism of iMCD has not been fully described. It is known that interleukin-6 (IL-6), a molecule that stimulates immune cells, plays a role in some cases of iMCD. IL-6 levels measured in some patients with iMCD increase and decrease with corresponding changes in disease activity, mice treated with IL-6 develop features of iMCD, and blockade of the IL-6 pathway using the medications siltuximab and tocilizumab effectively treats some patients with iMCD. However, many patients with iMCD do not demonstrate elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-6 levels are not strongly correlated with response to treatment with anti-IL-6 medications. In cases where IL-6 does play a role, the underlying cause of elevated IL-6 levels and the cells responsible for producing IL-6 remain unknown. Several theoretical mechanisms for iMCD have been proposed based on existing research and observed similarities between iMCD and other diseases that present with similar clinical findings and lymph node histology: * Autoimmune ‚Äì The immune system may produce antibodies that target healthy cells in the body instead of bacteria and viruses. Self-directed antibodies are commonly seen in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous and rheumatoid arthritis. * Autoinflammatory ‚Äì A mutation in a gene controlling inflammatory systems may contribute to harmful activation of inflammatory pathways in patients with iMCD. * Neoplastic ‚Äì Genetic mutations that develop in mature cells (somatic mutations) may cause an overgrowth of abnormal cells as in cancers such as lymphoma. * Pathogen ‚Äì Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is the known causative agent in HHV-8-associated MCD, which has very similar symptoms and findings to iMCD. While iMCD by definition is not caused by HHV-8, an unknown virus may cause the disease. There have been no reported cases of UCD transforming into iMCD.  Diagnosis  iMCD is diagnosed according to evidence-based consensus diagnostic criteria, which require a thorough evaluation including patient history, physical exam, laboratory testing, radiologic imaging, and microscopic analysis (histology) of biopsied tissue from an enlarged lymph node. Diagnosis of iMCD requires clinical abnormalities, exclusion of other diseases, and a lymph node biopsy showing features consistent with Castleman disease. A lymph node biopsy alone is not sufficient to make the diagnosis. = Laboratory testing = Laboratory testing may demonstrate elevated C-reactive protein, decreased hemoglobin levels (anemia), low albumin levels, elevated creatinine, increased immunoglobulin levels, and abnormal (elevated or decreased) platelet counts. Patients may also have elevations of molecules involved in inflammation (cytokines), such as Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). = Medical imaging = Radiologic imaging will demonstrate enlarged lymph nodes in multiple regions, which are typically 18F-fluorodoxyglucose (FDG) avid on positron-emission tomography (PET). = Associated diseases = iMCD is commonly seen in patients with POEMS syndrome, but it is unclear if iMCD occurs as an independent disease process or a manifestation of POEMS syndrome in these patients.Patients with iMCD have increased risk for solid tumors and cancers of the blood.Occasionally, iMCD patients present with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. = TAFRO Syndrome = iMCD patients with thrombocytopenia, anasarca, myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly syndrome (TAFRO syndrome) are considered to have a distinct clinical subtype of iMCD. Patients often have rapid progression of symptoms and frequently develop severe organ dysfunction. Compared to iMCD patients without TAFRO syndrome, iMCD patients with TAFRO syndrome are more likely to present with severe abdominal pain, low platelet levels, progressive renal dysfunction, and normal to mildly elevated immunoglobulin levels. While iMCD with TAFRO syndrome was first described in Japanese patients in 2010, cases of iMCD with TAFRO syndrome have since been reported in non-Japanese patients in many other countries. = Classification = Castleman disease describes a group of at least 3 distinct disorders‚ÄîUnicentric Castleman disease (UCD), human herpesvirus 8 associated multicentric Castleman disease (HHV-8-associated MCD), and idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD). Identifying the correct subtype of the disease is important, as the three disorders vary significantly in symptoms, clinical findings, disease mechanism, treatment approach, and prognosis. * In Unicentric Castleman disease enlarged lymph nodes with characteristic microscopic findings are present in only a single lymph node region. * In the multicentric subtypes of Castleman disease, enlarged lymph nodes with characteristic findings are present in multiple lymph node regions. The multicentric variants of Castleman disease are further classified by known causes of the disease.  HHV-8-associated MCD is caused by uncontrolled infection with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).  In idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) the cause of the disease is unknown (idiopathic). Testing for HHV-8 must be negative to diagnose iMCD.  Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease  iMCD may be further differentiated by the presence of associated diseases, such as polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, skin changes syndrome (POEMS syndrome), or by distinct clinical features, such as thrombocytopenia, anasarca, myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly syndrome (TAFRO syndrome). = Diagnostic criteria = Diagnosis of iMCD requires: the presence of both major criteria, multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes as demonstrated by medical imaging; the presence of at least two minor criteria, at least one of which must be an abnormal laboratory test; and exclusion of diseases that can mimic iMCD.  Major criteria 1: multiple regions of enlarged lymph nodes  Radiologic imaging must demonstrate enlarged lymph nodes in multiple regions.  Major criteria 2: microscopic analysis of lymph node biopsy consistent with iMCD  The microscopic appearance (histology) of biopsied tissue from an enlarged lymph node must demonstrate a constellation of features consistent with Castleman disease. There are three patterns of characteristic histologic features associated with iMCD: * Hypervascular - regressed germinal centers, follicular dendritic cell prominence, hypervascularity in interfollicular regions, and prominent mantle zones with an ‚Äúonion-skin‚Äù appearance. * Plasmacytic ‚Äì increased number of follicles with large hyperplastic germinal centers and sheet-like plasmacytosis (increased number of plasma cells). * Mixed ‚Äì features of both hypervascular and plasmacytic. iMCD most commonly demonstrates plasmacytic features; however, hypervascular features or a mixture of both hypervascular and plasmacytic features may also be seen in iMCD lymph nodes. The clinical utility of subtyping iMCD by histologic features is uncertain, as histologic subtypes do not consistently predict disease severity or treatment response. Staining with latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1), a marker of HHV-8 infection, must be negative to diagnose iMCD.  Minor criteria  Patients must experience at least two of the following 11 minor criteria with at least one being an abnormal laboratory test. Laboratory tests: * Elevated C-Reactive Protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate * Low hemoglobin levels (anemia) * Abnormal (low or high) platelet counts * Low albumin levels * Elevated creatinine * Increased levels of immunoglobulins (hypergammaglobulinemia) Clinical features: * Flu-like symptoms * Enlargement of the liver and/or spleen * Fluid accumulation (edema, ascites, pleural effusions) * Skin findings such as cherry hemangiomas or violaceous papules * Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis  Diseases to be excluded  Diagnosis requires exclusion of diseases that can present with similar clinical findings and similar appearance on microscopic analysis of tissue from an enlarged lymph node. Diseases that must be excluded in the diagnosis of iMCD include infectious diseases, such as HHV-8-associated MCD, Epstein- Barr virus mononucleosis, and reactive lymphadenopathy; autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis; and cancers, including lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and primary lymph node plasmacytoma.  Treatment  Due to the rarity of iMCD, data regarding treatment is limited and based on a combination of observational case series, case reports, and a single randomized clinical trial. Unlike UCD, for which surgery is the treatment of choice and curative for most patients, surgery is not effective in iMCD. Instead of surgical treatment, a variety of medications are used based on disease severity and a patient's response to prior treatments. Siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6, is the only medication approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of iMCD; however, successful use of other medications has been reported in the literature. In 2018, the first evidence-based consensus treatment guidelines for iMCD were published by an international group of experts in the field. In addition to creating a treatment algorithm for iMCD, these treatment guidelines established common definitions for disease severity and response to treatment. = Evaluation of iMCD Severity = Patients with iMCD are classified as having severe or non-severe disease based on the 5 criteria listed below. Patient with 2 or more of the below criteria are classified as having severe disease while patients with 0-1 of the criteria are classified as having non-severe disease. * Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ‚â• 2 * Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 or Creatinine > 3.0 mg/dL * Anasarca and/or ascites and/or pleural effusion and/or pericardial effusion * Hemoglobin ‚â§ 8.0 g/dL * Pulmonary involvement (e.g. interstitial pneumonitis with dyspnea) =Treatment response= Patients with iMCD are evaluated for treatment response based on changes in symptoms, sizes of involved lymph nodes, and laboratory testing. Each category is graded as a complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease. Overall treatment response is determined by the lowest category grade. For example, a patient with a complete laboratory response, a partial symptom response, and complete lymph node response would be given an overall treatment response of partial response. See below for descriptions of the criteria and grading of responses.  Laboratory Testing  Laboratory tests include all of the following: C-reactive protein, Hemoglobin, Albumin, and eGFR. * Complete response - All lab values within normal ranges * Partial response - >50% in all lab values * Stable disease - All lab values between <50% improvement and <25% worsening * Progressive disease - >25% worsening in any lab value = Symptoms = Four symptoms are assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (version 4): Fatigue, anorexia, fever, and body weight * Complete response - Normalization to pre-disease baseline * Partial response - Improvement in all 4 symptoms, but not to pre-disease baseline * Stable disease - Improvement in at least 1 (but not all) symptoms * Progressive disease - Worsening of at least 1 symptom on 2 or more assessments = Lymph Node = Treatment response for lymph nodes is evaluated using radiologic imaging and graded as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease based on modified Cheson criteria. = Treatment Algorithm = The treatment algorithm for iMCD is based primarily on disease severity and response to treatment. Because of the high rate of relapse with withdrawal of treatment, most patients with iMCD are treated with medications indefinitely.  Non-severe disease  Siltuximab, an IL-6 blocker, is the recommended treatment for all patients with non-severe iMCD regardless of measured IL-6 levels. Tocilizumab, a drug that also targets the IL-6 pathway, is commonly used as an alternative to siltuximab when siltuximab is unavailable. Corticosteroids may be added to anti-IL-6 therapy depending on clinical presentation. Rituximab, a drug targeting B-cells, is primarily recommended as a second line therapy for patients who do not respond to siltuximab or tocilizumab, but may be used as a first line agent in appropriate patients. For patients with non-severe disease who fail to respond to siltuximab, tocilizumab, and rituximab, treatment recommendations are not well defined. Cytotoxic chemotherapies have been reported to induce remission in patients with non-severe iMCD; however, the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies is not currently recommended for non-severe iMCD due to high likelihood of relapse and severe side effect profiles. As an alternative, immunomodulators such as thalidomide, cyclosporine A, sirolimus, bortezomib, and anakinra are recommended due to their similar response rates and more favorable long term side effect profiles.  Severe disease  Recommended initial treatment for all patients with severe iMCD is high dose steroids combined with an anti- IL-6 agent such as siltuximab or tocilizumab, regardless of measured IL-6 levels. For patients who immediately improve with this regimen, steroids may be slowly tapered, but the anti-IL-6 agent should be continued indefinitely due to the high relapse rate with withdrawal of treatment. Due to the high risk of complications associated with severe iMCD, if patients worsen or fail to improve with high dose steroids and anti-IL-6 therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens are recommended. Patients with life-threatening disease, particularly those with TAFRO Syndrome, may require advanced measures such as breathing support with a mechanical ventilator or treatment with dialysis for kidney failure. Following improvement in disease status, maintenance therapy with an anti-IL-6 agent or an immunosuppressant medication is typically continued indefinitely, as withdrawal of such medications can lead to relapse. = Follow-up = Patients with iMCD require routine assessment of treatment response and disease progression. It is recommended that follow-up visits include evaluation of symptoms, physical examination, laboratory testing, and radiologic imaging.  Prognosis  iMCD can present as an acute life- threatening disease in some patients or a chronic disease in others. Some patients have longstanding stable disease while others suffer flares of severe disease that may improve with treatment. Successful treatment controls symptoms and organ dysfunction associated with iMCD, improves symptoms and organ dysfunction during disease flares, and prevents future disease flares. Observed survival in a recent study of iMCD patients was 92% at 2 years, 76% at 5 years, and 59% at 10 years.  Epidemiology  There are approximately 1500-1800 new cases of iMCD diagnosed per year in the United States. iMCD can occur at any age, but the median age at presentation is approximately 50 years old. There is a slightly increased incidence of iMCD in women. There have been no published epidemiologic studies of Castleman disease outside of the United States; however, there has been no published data demonstrating increased or decreased incidence of Castleman disease in specific regions or ethnicities.

Desmond, who denied attacking Young, was reportedly unhappy that a story about the death of 1960s pop star Carl Wayne had not been included in the newspaper. Young took the Daily Express to an employment tribunal in 2005 but a settlement was reached the day before the hearing was due to begin. The terms of the settlement were not made public but press reports claimed Young was paid \\"a six-figure sum\\". =New York Daily News Online= Young was hired as editor of the New York Daily News Online by the newspaper's then editor-in- chief and fellow Briton Colin Myler in May 2012. During Young's time as web editor, it became the second most-visited newspaper website in the US, surpassed only by The New York Times. Young received press attention during 2012's Hurricane Sandy for managing to edit the New York Daily News overnight despite a power cut and flooding to its offices in New York City. =Metro= Young was appointed editor of Metro in April 2014, replacing Kenny Campbell. A month before he joined the newspaper, parent company DMGT separated production of Metro newspaper and www.metro.co.uk, moving management of the website to MailOnline. This meant Young's editorship would be focused entirely on the print and tablet editions. A different editorial team was established to run the website. Following a series of changes under Young, including a redesign and an expansion of its publication regions, Metro became the highest circulation newspaper in the UK in March 2018. Young was asked to appear before the UK Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee in April 2018, alongside other national newspaper editors, as part of its inquiry into the relationship between the media and hate crime in British society. He told MPs that Metro newspaper had tried to reduce racial tensions following terror attacks. Young told the committee: 'Mistakes happen but we definitely as a paper try to be proactive in promoting racial harmony and a sense of national togetherness, especially in times of crisis.' Personal life Young is married to Marie-Benedicte Fournier, who is originally from the Hautes Alpes, France. The couple have two children, a son, Christopher Pierre, and daughter Sophie. They live in London.

Danish unemployment hit a peak in 1993 with 12.4 percent unemployment. Since then, Denmark has seen a steady decline in unemployment rates, bottoming at 2.4 percent in 2007. This significant decrease in unemployment is attributed to Denmark's emphasis on active labour market policies (ALMP) throughout the 1990s; which sought to help workers obtain the skills needed to create a successful labour market. The Danish labour market is infused with a high degree of job mobility. The average job length in Denmark is 8 years, making it one of the lowest among the OECD countries. The system of labour market flexibility provides workers with a high level of benefits and allows employers to hire and fire employees with ease. This combination has been in place in Denmark since the 1970s, but the high costs of public benefits eventually began to strain government finances. Therefore, in the 1990s there was policy change that led to an emphasis on private insurance funds. The 1990s saw a decade of unemployment benefit insurance reform in Denmark. Government policy addressing employment security however, remained largely unchanged. Prior to the early 1990s reforms, Danish citizens were entitled to 2.5 years of unemployment benefits given they remained employed for 26 weeks out of the previous 3 years. During their unemployment benefit collection period, citizens were entitled by law to receive subsidized employment for 7‚Äì9 months. If employed under this program, individuals were then once again subject to receive another 2.5 years of unemployment benefits, essentially allowing for unlimited unemployment benefits. The reforms of the decade were devised to place an upper limit on entitlement to unemployment benefits. In 1995, the entitlement period for unemployment benefits was limited to 5 years, with a requirement for employment for 1 year in the past 3 years. Three years later, the maximum length of the unemployment benefit entitlement period was shortened to 4 years for individuals over the age of 25. These reforms have resulted in an average shorter length of unemployment period for Danish since when compared to pre-1990s statistics. More recent unemployment benefit policies have dealt with cash benefit reform. In 2013, the Danish government implemented a reform that aimed to reduce the amount of cash benefits given to unemployed youth, and instead transform those payments into education benefits in order to pursue its \\"usefulness initiative\\". These new cash benefit policies have had a positive effect on the flow of young adults away from unemployment and into education or employment.  Current policy  Currently, the legislation which encompasses the policies of these benefits is The Act on Unemployment Insurance, which is executed by the Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment under the Ministry of Employment. In order to become eligible for unemployment benefits, one must become part of one of the twenty four private and state approved Insurance funds; these funds are commonly known in Denmark as A-kasser's or A-kasse. To receive benefits through an insurance fund, one must be a part of the fund for at least one year prior to unemployment, register with the Public Employment Service, and fulfil a waiting period if unemployment is self-imposed. According to the government, registration with the Public Employment Service, also known as the jobcentret, must occur on the first day of a person's unemployment. From here, the claimant is required to specify the industry in which they wish to work, create a CV and look at jobs suggested for them every seventh day, in order to actively seek employment. The benefits received are contingent on one's registration with the Public Employment Service; the individual's insurance fund then assesses the benefits that they are to receive. The amount paid by their insurance fund depends on age, educational attainment, full or part time status and previous salary. Employment benefits in Denmark can involve up to 90 percent wage reimbursement per month for a maximum period of three years. Additionally, those who obtain part-time employment are able to receive what is known as a supplementary benefit. A supplementary benefit compensates for the remainder of a wage in order to provide a full time wage for a maximum period of 30 weeks. In Denmark, those not registered with an insurance fund may be eligible to receive some benefits through the state, depending on certain qualifications. The difference here is that these benefits are paid direct though a citizen's municipality. Recently, there have been changes to this generous benefit system. Beginning in 2019, only those who have lived in Denmark, Greenland, the Faroe Islands or some other European Union or European Economic Area country for seven out of the past eight years will be eligible to receive unemployment benefits. Additionally, reforms have been made regarding self-employment and non-standard employment policy in Denmark. These new criteria will take into account a company's overall revenue, tax constraints and type of industry when assigning new benefits in an effort to ensure that wage earning does accurately meet the needs of all workers. While there is much new research on active labour market policies in Denmark; some of the research has been inconclusive about the factors that have contributed to the success of such ALMP policies, including unemployment benefits. = Worker Activation = One of the identifiable features of Denmark's labor market and unemployment benefit policies is the high re-activation rate observed in its labor market. The Danish government provides considerable unemployment aid in the way of government programs focused on getting displaced laborers back to work. Weak job protection policies result in a high rate of labor turnover in the country, but effective job activation policies have ensured that the period of unemployment suffered by displaced workers remains short. As noted by the OECD, \\"seven displaced workers out of ten get back into work within one year\\". This statistic can be mainly attributed to the reduction in unemployment benefits by way of reforms during the 1990s and early 2000s and also to the effectual active labor market programs instituted in Denmark. In the Danish labor market, active labor market policy agencies have successfully served as intermediaries between employers and job seekers. These agencies have been particularly successful in helping economically disadvantaged groups and workers on the outskirts of the labor market through pre-employment training, job searching, CV writing, and subsidized \\"work trials\\", which allow employers and employees to measure the future success of candidates in their desired position.

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Soranthera. The generic name Soranthera is from the Greek (heap) and (blooming). The specific epithet ulvoidea refers to certain resemblances the algae has with Ulva. The name in Japanese is / ( or ) literally meaning \\"Kuril Islands bag nori\\". Description True to its common name, studded sea balloons are pale green to olive, ovoid sacs in diameter with small brown bumps on the surface. The bumpy 'studs' are the sori, which produce the zoosporangia. The sori are darker and measure 1 mm in diameter. There are groupings of multicellular hyaline 'hairs' in the center of the sori. The clavate to ovoid unangia (the unilocular reproductive structures or sporangia) are 78-100 Œºm long. The paraphyses are pluricellular (6-14 cells), also clavate, and almost double the length of the unangia. It has polystichous sporophytes. In juveniles, the 'balloons' are solid, but in adults they are hollow and pop when squeezed. Thalli are tall. The small, discoid holdfast underneath is barely noticeable and can include rhizoids. The rhizoids wrap around the thallus of the host, and will penetrate host tissue in structures resembling haustoria. However, these structures are not haustoria as S. ulvoidea is not parasitic; the holdfast is merely filling cavities in damaged areas of the host with no intermingling of cells. The earliest recognizable sign of the algae are tiny semicircular outgrowths among the stichidia on hosts such as Neorhodomela larix. S. ulvoidea resembles immature Leathesia, but when popped the thallus will smash together and not fall apart into filaments. It is also said to resemble Colpomenia sinuosa f. deformans and other Colpomenia species, especially when young. Taxonomy William Albert Setchell and Nathan Lyon Gardner describe two forms of the species. Soranthera ulvoidea f. typica is the typical form for the species as originally described by Alexander Postels and Franz Josef Ruprecht with a regular ovoid or globular shape. It is more common than the other form is in the southern part of the range. Soranthera ulvoidea f. difformis has fronds that have deep and sometimes irregular lobes. It is usually found in muddy or brackish water. Isabella Aiona Abbott notes that individuals growing on Odonthalia tend to be narrowly attached, thin walled, and obovoid, growing from central California up to Alaska. Those that have Neorhodomela as a host tend to be attached more broadly, thick walled, spherical, and occurring primarily in northern or central California. She, however, does not apply names to these forms. Soranthera leathesi√¶formis was placed in the genus at one time by Hippolyte Marie Crouan and Pierre Louis Crouan, however examination of the specimenNatural History Museum (2014).

A 2005 phylogenetic analysis showed no genetic evidence to support any infraspecific taxa or other species besides S. ulvoidea, despite the morphological differences of the forms. The study also noted that Botrytella micromorus (=Sorocarpus micromorus) is a close sibling taxon, as shown in their maximum likelihood tree of Chordariaceae: A 2011 study found a compatible tree using different representative species.

The type specimen was collected off of Baranof Island. It grows in protected or partially exposed areas of the low to high intertidal zone, and even in tide pools. Although typically found growing as an epiphyte, it also grows on rocks (epilithic) and sand. Ecology S. ulvoidea grows mainly as an epiphyte. Some of its common hosts include Odonthalia floccosa and Odonthalia aleutica. The type specimen was found growing on Neorhodomela larix. It also grows on other species of Odonthalia and Neorhodomela, which are all perennial red algae in the Rhodomelaceae family. The epiphytic relationship is thought to be beneficial to the host. Though the relationship was once thought to be parasitic, it is decidedly an epiphyte only. This contrasts with Harveyella, which also uses Odonthalia and Rhodomela as hosts but is a true parasite. S. ulvoidea is fed on by herbivores such as amphipods, Littorina, and Idotea. A study on the ecological impacts of ferry traffic at the Canadian Gulf Islands in British Columbia indicated that Soranthera is negatively affected by wakes, despite one of its hosts (Odonthalia floccosa) only being found at wake-impacted test sites. Methanolic extract of S. ulvoidea has been shown to inhibit Potato virus X (PXV) on lesions of Chenopodium quinoa.

Plot FBI agent Mark Adams (John Gabriel) poses as a member of a Las Vegas crime syndicate in order to infiltrate the hideout of a neo-Nazi group. Led by World War II Nazi war criminal Count von Delberg (Kent Taylor), the group prints counterfeit U.S. dollars, which they plan to circulate to help finance their party. Adams is aided from an undercover Israeli agent (Vicki Volante) whose parents were killed by von Delberg during the war; the count has in turn recruited a vicious Swastika-clad motorcycle gang, the Bloody Devils, to do his dirty work.  Cast  Production Shooting began in 1967 as a spy thriller under the working title Operation M, and then the film was subsequently retitled The Fakers. However, after the film couldn't be sold to a proper distributor, new footage featuring bikers was filmed, incorporated into the plot, and released through Adamson's and producer Sam Sherman's own newly-formed at the time Independent-International Pictures in 1970. According to Tom Weaver's book, It Came from Horrorwood, the bikers used in the film were from a real motorcycle gang and were busted for carrying weapons during production. Colonel Sanders makes an uncredited cameo appearance inside one of his restaurants, where the protagonists are dining. KFC paid for product placement and also fed the cast and crew. Nelson Riddle is co-credited as the composer of the opening titles' theme song, however, he was not involved with the production of the film. Sherman and Adamson bought the rights to a pre- existing Riddle cue and used it in the titles. Reception A short review of the film by Howard Thompson of The New York Times referred to the use of young motorbike riders he descried as \\"brutes\\" to be \\"box-office bait\\". He also expressed dismay at seeing Broderick Crawford, Scott Brady and Kent Taylor's involvement in the \\"smoking out\\" of a Nazi-minded counterfeiter. The review by Peter Roberts of The Grindhouse Cinema Database noted the \\"funky psychedelic\\" opening credits montage which he described as \\"real cool.\\" He also said that \\"this was more of an espionage film than a biker film.\\" He said that the advertising of the film was to bring in the drive-in audiences. He also said that it was entertaining and those who were \\"looking for a Hells Angels on Wheels\\" wouldn't find it in this one. Instead, viewers would get \\"a crazy mash up of babes, neo-Nazis, sexy bikers spies, undercover cops and shootouts.\\" References External links   =Reviews= * RideApart: Review by Bryan Wood * DVD Drive-In: Review by George R.

It has small globe-shaped, at first yellow, later pinkish flower heads of 1¬Ω‚Äì2 cm (0.6-0.8 in) in diameter, without a stalk, usually crowded with two to eight together near the end of the stems. It is known as oval-leaf pincushion in English, and patrysbos or kleinkopspeldekussing in Afrikaans. It is an endemic species of the south of the Western Cape province of South Africa, and flowers between August and December.  Description  The oval-leaf pincushion is a slender, stiffly upright and very sparsely branching evergreen shrublet mostly 1‚Äì1¬Ω m, occasionally up to 2 m (6 ft) high, with a single basal stem. The flowering stems are slender, 3‚Äì4 mm (0.12‚Äì0.16 in) in diameter, densely set with soft hairs. The leaves are small for a Leucospermum species, rounded egg-shaped to oval with entire margins, 1‚Äì2¬Ω cm (0.4‚Äì1.0 in) long and ¬Ω‚Äì1 cm (0.2‚Äì0.4 in) wide, densely overlapping, covered with fine silky hairs. The flower heads are globe-shaped, 1¬Ω‚Äì2 cm (0.6-0.8 in) in diameter, without a stalk, usually crowded with two to eight together near the end of the stems. The common base of the flowers in the same head is flat and 4‚Äì5 mm in diameter. The bracts subtending the flower head are arranged in three or four whorls, each broadly lance-shaped to oval, with a pointy or blunt tip, 5‚Äì7 mm (0.20‚Äì0.28 in) long and 2‚Äì5 mm (0.08‚Äì0.20 in) wide, papery in consistency and with a thin tuft of long straight hair at its tip, with a regular row of straight hairs along the margin but otherwise without hairs. The bracts subtending the individual flowers are lance-shaped with a pointy tip, about 6 mm (0.24 in) long and 2 mm (0.08 in) wide, densely covered in woolly hairs. The perianth is initially yellow in colour but changes to pinkish over time, is 8‚Äì10 mm (0.32‚Äì0.40 in) long. When the flower opens, a hairless and slightly quadrangular tube of 4 mm (0.16 in) long remains, while the four lobes curl back when the flower opens, which are covered in soft hairs. The highest part consists of oval lobes of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, with very few rough hairs. The styles are 1.4‚Äì1.6 cm (0.56‚Äì0.64 in) long, straight to a bit curved towards the center of the head, tapering towards the tip, at first yellow but aging to crimson. The thicked part at the tip called pollen presenter is abruptly cone- to egg-shaped with a pointy tip and about 1.0 mm (0.04 in) long, with a groove that functions as the stigma central at the very tip. The ovary is subtended by four opaque, threadlike scales with a blunt tip of about 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) long. The flowers of Leucospermum truncatulum have a slight scent. = Differences with related species = The oval-leaf pincushion differs from its nearest relatives by its small, entire, densely overlapping, egg-shaped leaves of 1‚Äì2¬Ω cm long, the papery involucral bracts that form a conspicuous involucre and the cone- to egg-shaped pollen presenter.  Taxonomy  The oval-leaf pincushion was first described in 1809 by Richard Anthony Salisbury in a book by Joseph Knight titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, calling it Leucadendrum truncatulum. It is assumed that Salisbury had seen a draft of a paper called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae that Robert Brown was to publish in 1810. Brown however, called the species Leucospermum buxifolium. In 1900, the genus name Leucospermum was conserved over Leucadendrum. The French botanist Jean Poiret assigned Brown's species to the genus Protea in 1816, making the combination P. buxifolia. Otto Kuntze moved buxifolium in 1891 to Leucadendron. Carl Ludwig Willdenow gave this pincushion the name Protea villosa given without a proper description in a book by Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel in 1825. Michel Gandoger distinguished Leucospermum buxifolium forma epacridea in 1901, which he raised together with Hans Schinz to Leucospermum epacrideum in 1913. In 1967, John Patrick Rourke created the new combination Leucospermum truncatulum, combining the conserved genus name Leucospermum R.Br with the earliest valid species epithed truncatulum Salisb. ex Knight. He regarded L. epacrideum as identical. Leucospermum truncatulum has been assigned to the section Diastelloidea or louse pincushions. The name of this species, truncatulum, is Latin and means \\"somewhat cut-off\\", although it remains unclear to which part of the plant this refers. The synonym buxifolium means with leaves like Buxus. The name Leucospermum buxifolium is still used in the trade of ornamentals and cut flowers. The common name in Afrikaans, patrysbos means \\"partridge bush\\", and may refer to francolins liking to eat the seeds, or because they are seen sheltering underneath the shrub during the hottest periods of the day.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The oval-leaf pincushion can be found from the eastern foothills of the Kogelberg Peak in the west, to the south along the Bot River, along the coast from Hermanus, almost reaching Cape Agulhas in the southeast of its range, north to Bredasdorp northwestwards via Caledon. Plants are mostly found in extensive stands. Across its range the average annual precipitation is between 650 and 1000 mm (25‚Äì40 in), most of which falls during the winter half year. The species prefers aciduous and nutrient-poor sands on east- and southward facing slopes from sea level to about 365 m (1200 ft) where grows in a dense sclerophyll vegetation further mainly consisting of other Proteaceae, Ericaceae and the grass-like Restionaceae. The oval-leaf pincushion is pollinated by insects, including bees and flies. When the fruits are ripe about two months after flowering, they fall to the ground. Here they are gathered by ants who are attracted to a pale fleshy ant loaf (or elaiosome) and carry them to their underground nests where the ant loaf is eaten, but the seeds remain safely stored. This seed dispersal strategy is known as myrmecochory. After above ground the plants are killed by the wildfires that naturally occur in the Fynbos every decade or two, chemicals from the charred vegetation which percolate with the rainwater, the seeds germinate and revive the population. Seeds also need night temperatures of and day temperatures of to trigger germination, circumstances which are characteristic for autumn in its home range and signal the arrival of the copious winter rains.  Conservation  Agricultural development has resulted in decreased populations of this species, and invasive alien Hakea and pines may in the future have a further impact. The species is not considered threatened however since most of the remaining locations are protected.

It is held annually in Ilid≈æa, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The festival was established in 1964 by the Association of Bosnian Recording Artists, is held in July and lasts for four days. The event hosts contemporary and traditional artists in genres under the umbrella of Folk, including Sevdalinka, Starogradska, Modern Folk, Novokomponovana, Macedonian Folk, Turbo-folk and accordion music. It has traditionally been the premier showpiece event for folk recording artists in Yugoslavia, with the two major Yugoslav record labels Jugoton and PGP-RTS releasing live LPs of each year's edition. Numerous acclaimed folk singers from the Former Yugoslavia were either signed by record labels or received wider media exposure following performances at the festival. Serbian Turbo- folk star Ceca performed at the 1988 edition when she was 15 years old and won the competition with her single Cvetak Zanovetak, while Hanka Paldum was signed by Diskoton after winning the newcomer competition in 1974. History Sarajevo was a traditional hub for folk music in the Former Yugoslavia, with numerous recording artists from other parts of the country moving to the city in hopes of being discovered and in search of artistic inspiration. The city's vibrant music venue scene that included countless live music clubs, bars and kafanas attracted interpreters of traditional Bosnian Sevdalinka and Romani music, as well contemporary folk singers and musicians of the day. In 1963 the Association of Bosnian Recording Artists organized the Meeting of Performers and Singers of Folk Music '63, which was a precursor to the festival and was held in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilid≈æa. One year later the festival was founded under the working title Festival of Folk Songs and Games ‚Äì Ilid≈æa (). The first edition was immediately endorsed by all major folk-based record labels and hosted performances by Safet Isoviƒá, Beba Selimoviƒá, Zaim Imamoviƒá and Silvana Armenuliƒá. The festival quickly grew in size and in 1969 its live performance LP went platinum by selling 1,700,000 copies. The 1970 edition was the first to receive more than 700 applicants and was rebranded as the Ilid≈æa Festival of Yugoslav Song. With the start of the Siege of Sarajevo and the Bosnian war, Ilid≈æa found itself in Serb-controlled territory and the festival's run was halted. After the Dayton Peace Accords were signed in 1995, the suburb was reintegrated into Sarajevo. The festival was reestablished in 1998 under the patronage of the Ilidza Municipality and the Sarajevo Canton. Since 2013 the festival is held in cooperation with the Hayat Television Network. In 2014 it celebrated its 50th anniversary.

It operated from 1909 to 1925 in the suburb of Killara. Pupils during the school's brief existence included two future prime ministers, William McMahon and Harold Holt. History Abbotsholme College was established in 1908 and began taking students the following year. The school's founder and principal was John Fitzmaurice, who was born in Ireland and was a nephew of the naval engineer Maurice Fitzmaurice. He fought with the British Army in the Boer War, after which he moved to Australia for health reasons. He was a proponent of progressive education, and named his new school after the Abbotsholme School that had been established by Cecil Reddie in Staffordshire, England. The Sydney Mail reported in 1920 that Abbotsholme had buildings and equipment worth ¬£30,000 and grounds of . It was promoted as an open air school, and advertisements often claimed that its students had one of the lowest rates of illness in the state. At the height of the 1919 Spanish flu pandemic it was one of the few schools that remained opened. Abbotsholme initially accepted both day students and boarders. However, by 1922 all 160 pupils were boarders, ranging in age from 6 to 19 years. In 1920, Fitzmaurice established a scholarship scheme for the sons of soldiers who had died in World War I. It initially consisted of 50 scholarships valued at a total of ¬£10,000, and was expanded through later endowments. The scheme drew the attention of Edward, Prince of Wales, who gave permission for them to be called the Prince of Wales Scholarships. Fitzmaurice was prominent in local Freemasonry circles, and in 1923 he gave free-ride scholarships to Abbotsholme to all the former students of the Charles Kolling Masonic College, a school for the sons of deceased Masons that had been forced to close. Fitzmaurice died suddenly in January 1924. The Daily Telegraph reported that his death was likely to endanger the scholarship schemes he had established, as there were no specific provisions in his will for their continuance. Abbotsholme closed in April 1925, and two months later it \\"burned practically to the ground\\" in suspicious circumstances.

The purpose of the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (the FCCA) is to create healthy and effective markets in which companies and other operators act responsibly and in keeping with consumers' interests. The FCCA functions according to the following acts: * Act on the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (661/2012):Act on the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (661/2012) // https://www.kkv.fi/en/facts-and-advice/competition- affairs/legislation-and-guidelines/act-on-the-finnish-competition-and- consumer-authority/ * Competition Act (948/2011)Competition Act (948/2011) // https://www.kkv.fi/en/facts-and-advice/competition-affairs/legislation-and- guidelines/competition-act/ Legislative development The FCCA was established as a result of the merger of the Finnish Consumer Agency and the Finnish Competition Authority. = The Finnish Consumer Agency = The first consumer council was formed in 1965. Since 1974, the consumer co-ordination council had been part of the Ministry of Trade and Industry (currently the Ministry of Employment and Economy). One result of this Council is the establishment of the Finnish Consumer Agency. However, its roots may be found in 1957, when the Social Democratic Women's Association established a Home Counselling Alliance. The women's organizations and representatives of the household for both co-operative movements were active representatives of these governmental consumer bodies. Consequently, stakeholders and pressure groups from women's organizations and consumer co-operatives addressed the empowerment of consumers.Wahlen S., Huttunen K. (2012) Consumer policy and consumer empowerment: comparing the historic development in Finland and Germany. International journal of consumer studies, 36 (1), 2-9. P. 5. = The Finnish Competition Authority = The Finnish Competition Authority was established in 1988 and it used to operate under the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Its aim was to protect sound and effective economic competition and to increase economic efficien—Åy by promoting competition and abolishing competition restraints.Holmes M. and Davey L. (2004). A Practical Guide to National Competition Rules Across Europe. Kluwer Law International. P. 94. = The merger of the Finnish Consumer Agency and the Finnish Competition Authority = Now both aforementioned agencies have been working together as the FCCA since 1 January 2013. With all functional differences between competition and consumer policies, both divisions aim to maintain the market order that consumers trust, and that creates incentives for economic growth. During the preliminary study that preceded the submission of the legislative proposal regarding the merger, several grounds for the merger were put forward in addition to the explicit savings targets in respect of support functions and the costs of premises. There are some reasons for the merge:Tuorila H. Roundtable on changes in institutional design of competition authorities // http://www.oecd.org/daf/competition # the functions of the agencies are connected with the markets, and there were also similarities in the agencies‚Äô objectives; # the need to increase and use cross-sector specific expertise; # the need to develop the research function; # the aim to increase the social weight and influence of competition and consumer affairs and to make their administration more effective.  Organizational structure  The FCCA consists of two main Divisions: the Competition Division and the Consumer Division.Information on the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority // https://www.kkv.fi/en/about-us/ The FCCA is led by the Director General Kirsi Leivo. The European Consumer Centre Finland is part of the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (FCCA). = The Competition Division = The departments which operate under competition affairs: * Enforcement 1, headed by Assistant Director Maarit Taurula * Enforcement 2, headed by Assistant Director Valtteri Virtanen *Enforcement 3, headed by Assistant Director Sanna Syrj√§l√§ * Advocacy Unit, headed by Assistant Director Arttu Juuti * International Affairs, headed by Assistant Director Rainer Lindberg = The Consumer Division = The following departments and functions deal with consumer affairs: * Consumer Protection 1, headed by Assistant Director Miina Ojaj√§rvi * Consumer Protection 2, headed by Assistant Director Outi Haunio- Rudanko * Consumer Protection 3, headed by Assistant Director P√§ivi Sepp√§l√§ * Advisory services, headed by Director Maija Puomila Moreover, the following departments operate directly under the Director General: * Market Research, Research Director Martti Virtanen * Communication, Director Laura Salmi * Administration, Head of Administration Anna Saharinen  Responsibilities  The two most important functions of the FCCA are supervision of compliance with legislation regarding public procurement and the merger control. = Public procurement = The new Act on Procurement and Concession Contracts (1397/2016) gave the FCCA the authority to monitor compliance with the legislation on public procurement from the beginning of 2017. The Act on Public Contracts in Special Sectors covers procurements by contracting entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal service. The Defence and Security Procurements Act is applicable to defence and security procurements. ln addition, the Act on Public Contracts contains sector- specific rules –æ–ø social and health services, and certain other service procurements. As –∞ Member State –æ—Ç the European Union, Finland is subject to the applicable EU legislation on public procurement. Finland has implemented the latest EU directives on public procurement, i.e. Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement, Directive 2014/25/EU on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and Directive 2014/23/EU on the award of concession contracts. The objective of procurement supervision is to ensure the implementation of the key principles of procurement legislation, such as openness and non-discrimination, in procurement. In the supervision of procurement, the FCCA's focus is primarily on the monitoring of illegal direct procurement and other corresponding procurements conducted in a blatantly erroneous or discriminatory manner. According to the Act on Procurement and Concession Contracts, the FCCA must draw up an annual report on its supervision of public procurements. The report on the first year of procurement supervision includes a summary of illegal activities observed by the FCCA during its procurement supervision operations, and of the measures referred to in the Act on Public Contracts. It is important to mention that anyone who considers that a contracting entity has contravened the procurement legislation may submit a request to the FCCA for measures to investigate the legality of the procedure. Damages claims can be sought in civil proceedings. = Merger control = In the field of the merger control the FCCA gives its permission to the deals concerning economic concentration. For example, the FCCA has approved the acquisition of Onninen Oy by Kesko Corporation,KESKO CORPORATION STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE 20.04.2016 AT 13.15 1(1) the sale of Stockmann Delicatessen in Finland to S Group's three regional cooperatives and SOK.STOCKMANN plc, Inside Information 15.12.2017 at 12:10 EET =Measures and available resources= The Consumer Ombudsman selects a measure enabling the best possible effectiveness to be achieved in light of the situation with the resources available. Options include, for example: * Provision of information to the company or entire sector; * Consumer education; * Cooperation with and lobbying of the industry organisation to change the practices of companies; * Request for clarification sent to the individual company in question; * Request for commitment from the company; * Prohibition; * Petition to the Market Court; * Consumer assistance in court; * Collective complaint; * Class action.  International cooperation  The FCCA annually works on approximately 600 international cooperation issues, and participates in the activities of roughly 50 international working groups involving competition policy. The FCCA's most important international cooperation partners in competition affairs include the ECN (European Competition Network) which includes the national competition authorities of the EU Member States. The FCCA also has close ties to the national competition authorities in other Nordic countries. Furthermore, the FCCA is an active participant in the OECD's (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), ICN's (International Competition Network) and the ECA's (European Competition Authorities) international cooperation on competition- related affairs.The International Comparative Legal Guide to: Merger Control 2017. Chapter 18: Finland. P. 146. The Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority (FCCA), earlier The Finnish Consumer Agency & Ombudsman, has been a member of the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) since 1993.http://www.beuc.eu/beuc-network/members/finnish-competition-and-consumer- authority-fcca The FCCA develops relations with the agencies of other countries. For example, the FCCA cooperates with the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (the FAS). The cooperation is shown in such directions asProgram on cooperation between the Federal Antimonopoly Service (Russian Federation) and the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority for 2016-2017 * The exchange of legal and other normative documents as well as information exchange; * the organization of meetings of the Heads of Authorities; * in the field of organization of traineeships for the Parties‚Äô representatives and organizing symposiums, conferences and seminars.

It has been called one of the world's greatest places by Time magazine in 2019https://time.com/collection/worlds-greatest- places-2019/5654151/transcaucasian-trail-caucasus/. A long-distance trail in the Caucasus has been a lingering idea for trekkers and hikers for many years since they started hiking remote parts of the region. Many sections of the TCT already exist, used by local community members and shepherds for centuries. These trails cross long valleys and traverse mammoth mountains to connect mountain villages together. In recent years many of these trails have fallen into disrepair, and while many trails are known to locals, they are difficult to navigate for visitors and tourists. In 2015, two former Peace Corps volunteers, Paul Stephens and Jeff Haack, mapped and charted known routes in the Republic of Georgia. During this time they succeeded in locating many connections between known trails and publicizing the concept of a long- distance trail. At the same time, British explorer Tom Allen began an attempt to hike the length of the Republic of Armenia, which was unsuccessful due to an absence of known routes and detailed maps. Allen devised a 'Transcaucasian Trail' project to remedy these problems, and discovered Stephens' shared vision when attempting to register the same domain name, at which time the two decided to collaborate\\"Land Rover Bursary recipients pioneer new routes for the Transcaucasian Trail (TCT)\\". In late 2015, Allen approached British 4x4 manufacturer Land Rover and the UK's Royal Geographical Society for funding to scout a potential route traversing the Lesser Caucasus through Armenia and southern Georgia, launching the 'Transcaucasian Expedition' in April 2016\\"Royal Geographical Society - Land Rover Bursary\\". In July of the same year, Stephens initiated the first trail construction and maintenance project in Svaneti, Georgia, employing international volunteers to carry out the work. The Transcaucasian Trail Association nonprofit organisation and Transcaucasian Trail Armenia NGO were formed later that year. In 2017, the volunteer trail building programme expanded to Dilijan National Park in Armenia and continued in the Svaneti region of Georgia. Today, over 400 km of the proposed route of the trail has been improved and marked in Georgia and Armenia. The long-term goal is to build two trail corridors of approximately 1,500 km each. The \\"northern route\\" would follow the Greater Caucasus Mountains through northern Georgia and Azerbaijan from the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, though parts of this route are problematic due to conflict zones. Meanwhile, a \\"southern route\\" will traverse the Lesser Caucasus Mountains through southern Georgia and Armenia, taking hikers from the Black Sea to the River Arax at Armenia's border with Iranhttps://transcaucasiantrail.org/en/about/vision-philosophy/.

In partnership with Rev. Sara Mouer, Richard served as a permanent pastor in churches across Wisconsin. She also conducted evangelistic work across the United States during a period when the ordination of women was severely limited or denied outright for most Christian denominations including the United Brethren church.  Early life  Richardson was born on February 8, 1889 in Richland County, Wisconsin. As an adult, she taught school in Richland and Grant County, Wisconsin. In 1923, at age 34, Richardson entered theBonebrake Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio.  Career  Richardson graduated from Bonebrake in 1926. While at the seminary, she met Sara Mouer, with whom she made a plan ‚Äúfor sharing their ministerial careers‚Äù. Mayte was ordained on September 12, 1926 at Turtle Lake, Wisconsin. After ordination she joined Mouer for their first assignment at the United Brethren church at Ontario, Wisconsin from 1926-1932. In December 1932 the two pastors were assigned to the United Brethren church in Monroe, Wisconsin. Upon their assignment, the local newspaper stated that ‚Äúa permanent woman pastor is an innovation in Monroe.‚Äù Richardson and Mouer served in Ontario, Monroe, Loyd- Ithaca, Lime Ridge-Sandusky and Beloit Wisconsin from 1926 to 1959. Richardson and Mouer also served for five years as evangelists from 1936 to 1941, fulfilling calls across the United States. Reverends Richardson and Mouer were known for the musical aspects of their ministry which ‚Äúincluded duet signing with Miss Richardson playing the accompaniment‚Äù. This partnership continued until Mouer‚Äôs death on April 27, 1959. Rychie Breidenstein states in How Shall We Be Known that ‚Äúthese were two women whose way of life and ministry would, today, be subject to all kinds of scrutiny, yet they seemed to have found a way to make ‚Äòall things work together for good‚Äô in God‚Äôs service‚Äù (58). After Mouer's death, Richardson moved to Richland Center, Wisconsin where she served as a substitute pastor and conducted special services until her death in December 1963. Richardson spent the larger part of her career as an ordained minister in a denomination that denied ordination to women. She was ordained under the auspices of the United Brethren Church which had permitted the ordination of women from 1889 to 1946. However following the merger of the United Brethren Church with the Evangelical Association in 1946, the ordination of women was no longer permitted. It was only in 1968, five years after Richardson‚Äôs death, that Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB) members through their merger with the Methodist Church accepted women for ordination as members of the United Methodist Church. While women ministers were an innovation for the rural communities of Wisconsin that Richardson served with Mouer, the ministerial pair were beloved by their communities.

Architecture The roof of the haveli is made up of wooden planks. Considering the hot temperature of Lahore, the haveli has high ceilings. Around 1901, Haveli was divided into Zanan Khana and Mardan Khana. A room was called Sheesh Mahal (glass palace) because the room had glass work done in it. During the Sikh era, a prayer room was built for the Sikh holy book, Granth Sahib. The room also has murals of the Sikh general fighting demons. Location Haveli Barood Khana is located in old Lahore city facing the Lahore Fort, close to Taxali Gate. It is also close to Shahi Mohallah Bazaar, Jamia Masjid Hanfia, the shrine of Pir Hazrat Baba Nauguzah and Badshahi Mosque. The British built a water tank near the haveli which supplied water to the city. Popular culture The haveli is used for cultural activities and is an important part of Lahore culture. Haveli Barood Khana was the centre of the Basant festival in Lahore and has hosted royalty, presidents, politicians, international dignatories over the years. Many important events have been hosted there such as musical evenings, TV/movie shootings, politicians, actors, musician etc. Some scenes of the movie Khuda Kay Liye were shot here. Pakistan Television Corporation used this as a location to record music- related program ‚ÄòVirsa: Heritage Revived‚Äô.

This was considered the remedy in cases where excommunication was deemed insufficient and that sterner measures were required to secure obedience to the law. The secular arm as a means by which lay power intervenes in ecclesiastical cases had two types: sought and unsought by the Church. In the Middle Ages especially in Inquisition trials for heresy, or grave immorality, ecclesiastical courts delivered convicted clerical and lay offenders over to the secular arm to administer severe capital punishments. The phrase \\"relaxed to the secular arm\\" was used by the Spanish Inquisition to describe the handover of the condemned heretic. On the other hand, an individual could seek a civil court to interfere - invoking the secular arm - on account of a miscarriage of justice on the part of church authorities. The medieval Latin phrase 'brachium seculare' was translated first into late Middle English.The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Religion Background Introduced circa 1180‚Äì1250 at the time of the Albigensian Crusade, the church inquisitors delivered a Cathar heretic, or any heretic, to the secular arm, to be burnt at the stake. Under canon law church tribunals had no jurisdiction to impose penalties involving mutilation or death.Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages p.260 The law, however, provided that the judge of a common law court had the right to invoke the secular arm to address the culpability of an individual, who was a subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Notably the contrary circumstance of appeal by individuals to the secular authorities to interfere with, or hinder, the process of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was until recently punished in the Roman Catholic Church by excommunication.The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (3 ed.)p.532 Sources Catholic Culture The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Religion References Category:History of Catholicism in Europe Category:Canon law ","title":"Secular arm"},{"id":"57315235","text":"The Pest Control Products Act is a portmanteau for Canadian legislation to govern the application of pesticides.

He was mortally wounded while in jail, shot twice in the back while resisting white mob members who came to take him out; the whites pulled him into the Public Square and hanged him from a post outside the police station, with a crowd of an estimated 2,000 in attendance. The sheriff interrupted the hanging and took Jones down. Taken back to the jail, Jones died of his injuries on April 9, 1872. Lynching David Jones, an African-American man, was accused of murdering white man Henry Murray, who died in March 1872. Jones was arrested and taken to the county jail in Nashville. At 7pm on March 25, 1872, a mob met outside the Maxwell House Hotel in Downtown Nashville. By 9pm, they walked to the jail, where they broke into Jones's cell, shot him twice when he resisted, and put a halter around his head. They took him to the public square and hanged him on the gas post outside the police station. A crowd of 2,000 onlookers surrounded Jones. Sheriff Donaldson interrupted the hanging, taking Jones down from the post and carrying him back to the police station. The crowd dispersed at 10pm. Former Nashville mayor and Tennessee representative Major Richard Boone Cheatham asked the crowd to go home, and Nashville Mayor Kindred Jenkins Morris and Governor John C. Brown made their way to the scene. Governor Brown ordered a detachment of federal troops from Ash Barracks to act as a posse under the mayor's direction, and vowed to prosecute the lynchers. Jones was mortally wounded from the gunshots, and died of his injuries several days later on April 9, 1872. The Nashville Union and American suggested the lynching was perpetrated by \\"twenty or more negroes.\\" The Chicago Tribune said the lynchers were thought to be \\"railroad men.\\" After Jones died, in April 1872 Governor Brown offered a reward of $500 to anyone able to identify the lynchers.

The Compendium politicum: ex universa civili doctrina Justi Lipsii pro principatu, tum ex Notis integra fide concinnatum was published by Persius in Frankfurt in 1614.., and the Telescopium: sive ars perficiendi novum illud Galilaei virorium instrumentum ad sydera, by Paul Jacob in 1618 His Telescopium book was written around 1612, only 4 years after the telescope was invented. The book contained a complete set of instructions and diagrams for building a refracting telescope. Sirtori pointed out that \\"a workman had to be most careful in polishing otherwise the lens became lopsided or aspherical with peripheral distortion\\". The book states that the goal is to create a lens with perfectly spherical surfaces. He may have also invented the method of the spherical grinding of moulds, which improved lens grinding and polishing techniques dramatically. With the rapid dissemination of the telescope the priority question about the inventor soon arose. Sirtori downplayed the achievement of the first discovery of the telescope by presenting the story of Johannes Lippersein, who would have grasped the idea from ‚Äòa genius or some other man, as yet unknown, of the race of Hollanders,‚Äô who had visited a Middelburg spectacle maker. It's believed that Sirtori might also be the author of the Sirtori cipher, given to the King Philip II and ordered on 1 July 1574. The cipher contains mining discoveries from American ports (gold and silver), and was conserved in the AGI (Archivo General de Indias). From 1509 the King had ordered that all American riches should be 'secret' or 'coded' with the cipher that \\"you have taken from the Secretary\\".

He played college football at Florida. Early life Pi√±eiro was born in Miami, Florida, to Cuban and Nicaraguan immigrants. His father, Eddy Sr., came to the United States from Cuba at the age of nine during the Mariel boatlift of 1980 and later had a professional soccer career with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the ASL/APSL. Pi√±eiro started off playing soccer like his father; he was a four-time All-Dade County pick in soccer. Despite having grown up only playing soccer, he joined the Miami Sunset Senior High football team in his senior season, handling extra points and kickoffs. College career Pi√±eiro signed with Florida Atlantic on a scholarship to play soccer but academic issues prevented him from attending. His dad encouraged him to try on football cleats and pads but with no football scholarship, Pi√±eiro went on to play soccer for a small junior college, ASA College. In the summer of 2015, Pi√±eiro went to an open kicking combine at Alabama. Out of hundreds of kickers, Alabama coach Nick Saban narrowed his scholarship offers to Chris Salek and Pi√±eiro. Pi√±eiro verbally committed to Alabama, but later tried out for Florida and ultimately chose to play there. Pi√±eiro played for the Gators during the 2016 and 2017 seasons. During his final year at Florida, Pi√±eiro had the best field goal percentage in the nation, making 17 out of 18 attempts for a 94.4% conversion rate. His career conversion rate of 88.4% (38-for-43) ranks first in school history (minimum 35 attempts), surpassing Bobby Raymond (who made 43 of 49 kicks, or 87.8%, in 1983 and 1984). Pi√±eiro's 38 made field goals rank sixth in school history, and his streak of 16 straight made field goals to close the 2017 season tied Jeff Chandler (2001) for the second-longest streak in program history. Professional career =Oakland Raiders= Pi√±eiro declared for the 2018 NFL Draft early after only two seasons with the Gators, only to go undrafted. He signed with the Oakland Raiders as an undrafted free agent on May 4, 2018. He was placed on injured reserve on September 1, 2018. =Chicago Bears= 2019 season On May 6, 2019, Pi√±eiro was traded to the Chicago Bears in exchange for a conditional seventh-round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, and he was one of nine participants in the Bears' 2019 summer kicking competition to replace Cody Parkey. The tryout was orchestrated by coach Matt Nagy to find a new kicker in the wake of the Bears' \\"Double-Doink\\" loss against the Philadelphia Eagles in the playoffs, when Parkey missed the game- winning field goal when the ball hit the upright and then bounced off the crossbar before falling to the ground. On August 24, in a preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts, Pi√±eiro connected on field goals from 21 yards and 58 yards away. He also went 2-for-2 on extra points. Pi√±eiro finished the 2019 preseason connecting on 8 of 9 field goals and 3 of 4 extra points. His misses included a 48-yard field goal attempt against the Carolina Panthers on August 8, 2019, and an extra point attempt that went very wide to the left against the Tennessee Titans on August 29, 2019. In the first game of the 2019 regular season against the Green Bay Packers, Pi√±eiro made his first NFL field goal on a 38-yard kick. The field goal ended up being the only points the Bears scored as they lost 10‚Äì3. During Week 2, Pi√±eiro kicked a game-winning 53-yard field goal as time expired to give the Bears a 16‚Äì14 win over the Denver Broncos. He also made a 52-yard field goal in the second quarter. For his performance, Pi√±eiro was named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. In Week 8, Pi√±eiro missed two out of five field goal attempts, including a potential game-winning 41-yard attempt as time expired, as the Bears lost to the Los Angeles Chargers 17‚Äì16. He missed his first regular-season extra point the following week, when his second of three extra-point attempts sailed wide right. He made his two other extra-point attempts in the Bears' 20‚Äì13 win over the Detroit Lions. He had been perfect on his first 15 attempts. In Week 11, Pi√±eiro missed two field goals in the Bears' three first-quarter possessions during their game against the Los Angeles Rams; the Bears eventually lost 17‚Äì7. Nagy commented he would stick with Pi√±eiro as his kicker, and that he would not bring other kickers in to try out, even though Pi√±eiro was ranked 31st in the league in field-goal percentage at that point. After missing an extra point (but making his two field goal attempts) in the Bears' Week 12 win over the New York Giants, Pi√±eiro was perfect in the final five games of the season, including making all nine field goal attempts and all eight extra point attempts. In the season finale against the Minnesota Vikings, he was perfect on one extra point and four field goal attempts, including the game- winning 22-yarder to secure the 21‚Äì19 victory. Pi√±eiro ended the 2019 season with 23 of 28 field goals made (82.1 percent).  2020 season  After the 2019 season, both coach Matt Nagy and general manager Ryan Pace expressed confidence that Pi√±eiro would be the team's kicker in 2020. \\"For us, you all know, [kicker] was a huge, huge, big void that we had going into this year,\\" Nagy said. \\"I feel pretty good that that void is filled. I feel like that's a positive from this year.\\" In April, the Bears announced that they had signed former Nevada kicker Ramiz Ahmed and intended for Ahmed to compete with Pi√±eiro for the Bears' 2020 placekicker job. Pace explained, \\"We see those guys competing. Look, we love Eddy, and we think his future's very bright.... But those two competing against each other is a really good thing.\\" On August 11, Ahmed was waived, effectively making Pi√±eiro the Bears' kicker for the 2020 season. However, Pi√±eiro struggled with a groin injury that prevented him from kicking in training camp and resulted in him being placed on injured reserve on September 8. Personal life Pi√±eiro is a Christian. In 2017, Pi√±eiro and his father, Eddy Pi√±eiro Sr., were awarded the Police Service Award from the Gainesville Police Department for helping a woman escape from a domestic abuser. Pi√±eiro is the first player of Nicaraguan descent to play in the NFL. Before the Bears‚Äô October 2019 game against the Oakland Raiders in London, Pi√±eiro received a glass sculpture as a gift from Nicaragua‚Äôs ambassador to the United Kingdom.

History  William Penn was originally a Mexican land grant to Issac Jackson, who later sold the land to John G. Pitts. In 1849, John C. Eldridge settled in the area, who named the town after a steamboat. In the 1850s, Robert Hallum constructed a house in the area which still stands. In the 1860s a Lutheran church was built followed by a cemetery. A post office was built in 1873 that remained active until 1916. In 1876, the church built a school. By the 1890s, William Penn's economy was almost exclusively agricultural with a commercial sector and a wagon maker. In the 1910s, William Penn had two cotton gins, one of which did not close down until 1988. Ranching is the only remaining commercial activity in the area. The estimated population is 100.

Sleep (born 14 February 1945) is an American geophysicist and professor of geophysics at Stanford University. He has done internationally recognized research on plate tectonics and many other areas of geology and planetology.  Education and career  In 1967, Sleep graduated with a B.S. in mathematics from Michigan State University. He then studied geophysics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he earned his master's degree in 1969 and a doctorate in geophysics in 1973. After a brief period as a postdoctoral research associate at MIT, he joined Northwestern University in 1973 where he was an assistant professor of geophysics until 1979. He was from 1979 to 1984 an associate professor and from 1984 to 1993 a full professor of geophysics and geology at Stanford University. Since 1993 he has been a professor of geophysics there.  Research  Since 1969, Sleep has done research on mid-ocean ridges. He first demonstrated the temperature dependence of the ratio of water depth to the age of the underlying ocean floor and developed models that showed the great influence of the circulation of hydrothermal fluids on the chemistry of the seawater and the structure of the ridges. In the 1970s he explored the formation of stretched continental margins. He measured the subsidence rate, which can be determined from thickness and age of deposited sedimentary rock, and found that the subsidence history was not affected by the subsidence history of oceanic crust. Further areas of research were island arcs and subduction zones, the composition of the atmosphere, as well as impact events affecting the entire planet. In addition, he explored the mechanisms of geological disturbances, and was able to prove the great influence of water on their movements. In the mid-1970s, he began research on magmatism, and until the early 1990s, dealt with the temperature history of the Earth's mantle. He also studied the formation and composition of mantle plumes, as they exist under Hawaii. Until the mid-1990s, he worked on transferring his findings in the field of magmatism to Mars and, with Roger J. Phillips, developed a model for the Tharsis region.

However, it seems that an exception occurred in the case Ward & Lee, P.L.C. v. City of Claremore 316 P.3d 225, which came before the OCCA on May 31, 2013. Robert D. Bell presided over the three-judge panel and wrote the majority opinion.\\"Ward & Lee, P.L.C. v. City of Claremore.\\" Westlaw. 2018. Accessed May 19, 2018. The case was appealed after Judge Sheila A. Condren had ruled against Ward & Lee's client, Richard Stangland, who had been arrested for DUI by a Claremore Police Department (CPD) officer. The core issue in this case was the refusal of the CPD to release the dash-cam video of the arrest (along with certain other items of evidence), so that Attorney Lee could present them at the lower court trial. CPD replied that it adhered to a policy written by Police Chief in 2011, stating that evidence such as dash cam videos and audios were not public records and must not be released for any reason without his specific approval. After reviewing the laws relevant to this topic, Judge Bell found that the CDP policy violated the Oklahoma Open Records Act, which specifically stated that such evidence constituted a public record and cannot be withheld.\\" This determination resulted in the Civil Appeals Court overturning the District Court verdict, which was directed to retry the case with the formerly missing evidence. The appeals verdict also noted that, \\"...any person denied access to a public record and who successfully brings a civil action for declarative or injunctive relief is entitled to reasonable attorney fees.

Habitat and distribution Cerrena zonata is a white rot fungus that grows on dead hardwoods. In Asia, it has been recorded from India to Thailand, Vietnam, China, Far East Russia, and Japan. It is also in New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina.

From 1826, the first cotton arrived. These 300 bales were brought by wagon. Even today, cotton is important to Memphis. By the start of the American Civil War, Memphis with its river port, bankers, manufacturers, and brokers became the business focus for the Mid-South.

The cotton industry had a great influence on the city and the region. A variety of jobs were created, such as: spinners', buyers, buyers for expert, cotton classers, weighers, compress hands and clerks.

Background The Infernal Marriage appeared in a series of editions of the New Monthly Magazine published from July to October 1834. Its story was never concluded because the remaining manuscripts were stolen from Disraeli's chambers, and he \\"never had the heart to undertake it again\\".  Synopsis  Pluto, the king of hell, whisks Proserpine, the daughter of Jupiter, away to Hades. They are greeted by Pluto‚Äôs loyal but monstrous dog, whom Proserpine takes an instant disliking to. She asks Pluto to prove his love for her by banishing the dog, which he does by promoting him from his role of Guardian of the Gates. Pluto and Proserpine are disturbed one morning by a furore brought to them by Terror and Rage concerning a mortal who has got into hell. The mortal explains to the Hades assembly that his wife has died and he wants Pluto to revive her. Pluto declines but Proserpine pleads with him to yield which he does. The assembly wishes to call the Guardian of the Gates to account but learn that he has been ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù. Seeing the influence of the queen, all the assembly members resign. alt=A young man of vaguely Semitic appearance, with long and curly black hair Shortly afterwards Proserpine falls ill but is brought back to health by an esteemed doctor brought to hell for that purpose. It is agreed that Proserpine should complete her recovery by visiting Elysium, Pluto remaining in Hades due to the difficult political situation. Proserpine‚Äôs enemies see this as an opportunity to move against her. Proserpine sets off with a seer (Tiresias), the ship‚Äôs captain and Lady Manto. En route they stop at a cavern owned by the Titan Porphyrion who has a toy model of the stars and skies which Saturn, who is now a dethroned monarch, made. Proserpine resolves to visit Saturn, whom they find in a magnificent palace with Titans. He attributes his fall to having unsuccessfully taken on the ‚Äúspirit of the time‚Äù, embodied by Jupiter who, since coming to power, has not acted on the emancipatory liberal principles he espouses. Proserpine thinks they should embrace the spirit of the age. Saturn then takes Proserpine to the Valley of Lamentations where they see the defeated Titans including Hyperion and Enceladus who laments their fall and, like Oceanus, is pessimistic about their prospects. Another Titan (Briareus) thinks they should fight back and blames the loss of Olympus (to Jupiter) on the Titans being disunited, thereby letting in the Olympians, whereas Rhoetus believes the only way to beat the Olympians is by ridiculing them. Proserpine‚Äôs party journeys on to Elysium which is wonderful. The novel ends describing the habits of the Elysians, e.g. if rumours start to spread of a couple being devoted to each other, people deliberately spread other fabricated tales so that people cannot separate the lies from the facts so that nobody knows what to believe. The Elysians just enjoy themselves, all the work being done by Sylphs and Gnomes. Reception and analysis The novelist William Beckford appreciated the novel conveying the message to its author via a friend, \\"Pray tell Disraeli that I have read, enjoyed, and admired his Infernal Marriage. The sly, dry humour of that most original composition is to me delightful.\\" Disraeli's father, Isaac, also a writer, considered The Infernal Marriage and the novel it immediately followed, Ixion in Heaven, to be his son's most original contribution to literature.Blake Much of the analysis of the novel has focussed on what its contents represented. Twenty years after publication, Disraeli himself wrote that Jupiter represented George IV, Apollo Lord Byron, Tiresias Talleyrand and Manto the Duchess of Dino.Letters 1852-6 The introduction to the 1926 edition extended the list by likening Saturn to Charles X, Oceanus to Lord Goderich, Hyperion to Robert Peel, Elysium to London and the Titans led by Enceladus to the Tories under the Duke of Wellington with the young Disraeli represented by the mocking Rhoetus. A more modern review, however, speculated that Enceladus represented Lord Lyndhurst before going on to suggest that, \\"Disraeli's propensity to autobiographical narratives,\\" meant that the Pluto-Proserpine relationship reflected \\"Disraeli's own problems with Henrietta [Sykes]\\" with whom Disraeli was conducting an affair at the time of writing The Infernal Marriage.

History  In the 1950s the date of its construction was set for the first half of the 11th century. Recent research, however, indicates that it might be as late as around 1180. The rotunda was erected within the walls of the castellan stronghold at the top of Castle Mount (built in the 10th century and the first half of the 11th century). The first reference to the rotunda comes from 1223, where it was described as St. Nicolas Chapel, obliged to pay a tithe to Norbertine‚Äôs sisters in Rybnik [4]. The end of the 13th century and the entire 14th century was related to a reconstruction of the castle and replacement of wood by bricks. The Romanesque rotunda was adapted to the Gothic castle: the level of the floor was raised by two meters, Romanesque windows in the apse were walled up and bigger, Gothic ones were created. In 1484 the chapel burned down together with the castle, however this did not significantly influenced its condition. In 1495 a parson of Pszczyna, Wac≈Çaw Hynal from Stonawa, funded an altar of The Divine Providence, Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, Saint Ersmus and Saint Wenceslas. This gave the basis for attempts to present the last one as the patron saint of the rotunda. When Princess Lucretia, the last of the Piast dynasty, died in 1653 the rotunda ceased to be the castle chapel. Since that time the rotunda has been the property of the Chamber of Cieszyn established by the Habsburgs. The new managers did not pay much attention to the church, however the sources state that the Rotunda did not go to rack and ruin. In 1722 and 1755 it was written that the Rotunda ‚Äúis old, domed and twice a year, on Saint Wenceslas and Saint Nicolas days services are held there‚Äù. In the early years of the dominance of the Habsburgs the Rotunda was used as a repository for tools required for performance of the so-called orchards God‚Äôs Judgements and sometimes also as an arms depot. At the time of the conversion of the lower castle in 1838-40, the Romanesque walls of the temple were ringed by a brick wall. New and bigger windows were walled out and a new, tin helmet was put up. The level of the interior nave and the exterior area was raised (the building was almost halfway up rimmed by soil). The Romanesque chapel received a classical division of the fa√ßade adjusted to the style of the castle. The design of a romantic pavilion was created by Joseph Koernhausel. The interior of the Rotunda was decorated by a neo-gothic wooden altar and a picture of Saint Wenceslas. During World War II, as a result of archaeological research conducted by the Germans, plasters were removed and the original level of the floor was restored. Further archaeological and works (conducted under the supervision of A. Kietli≈Ñski) and restoration works were carried out in 1947-1955. Thanks to restoration works (supervised by Z. Gawlik) that comprised a reconstruction of the gallery, disclosure of the original windows, the altar stone and the floor the Rotunda regained its Romanesque characteristics. After the end of World War II the temple became a tourist attraction and the first service after a break of approx. 50 years took place on 6 December 1997 and was related to the resacralisation of the church.  Architecture  The rotunda is build of flat limestone chops that create an internal and external front, with circular layout with a semicircular and oriented apse. The space between the fronts is filled with rubble and crushed stone joined by lime mortar. A circular nave is covered by a dome made of concentrically arranged stones, the apse is covered by a semi- dome. In the north part of the nave there are one-way stairs leading to the gallery - a kind of a balcony supported by columns and semi-columns (located from the western side) - placed in a wall that in this spot is 1.75 m thick. At the top of the stairs leading to the gallery there is a walled-up Romanesque portal , which decorated a passage to the palatium, the seat of a castellan for whom the gallery was constructed. A semi-circular apse with three stairs is oriented to the East. The apse is separated by an internal phase and closed by a conche emphasised by building stones. The altar stone located in the apse is a hole for relics or holy oils. A similar role was played by a niche in the south wall with a Gothic brick framework and three round holes for extinguishing candles below. In the apse there are two two-way embrasured Romanesque windows. Two narrow slot windows light up the upper part of the nave. Additional light for the nave came from slot windows located at ¬æ of the height of the wall. On the rainbow arch that separated the nave from the apse traces of a Romanesque paining from the second part of the 15th century was found with tracery. The nave was covered by a dome with a concentric arrangement of stones. The nave is 13 metres high, the apse is 6.8 metre high and the total height of the rotunda is approx. 15 metres. Entrance to the Rotunda is located on the western side of the building. From the outside, where the stairs are located, the wall is thickened and creates a slightly protruding bay window hanged over cantilevers. The roof over the nave and the apse are cone-shaped and covered by shingles. Classicistic reconstruction in 1839 by the design of Joseph Kornh√§usl involved walling out two semi-circular windows and plastering the fa√ßade. In 1947-1955 reconstruction works were carried out, during which the rotunda was restored to its original state and the gallery in the south part was reconstructed on the basis of preserved parts.  Patron saints  Saint Wenceslaus, the second part of the eighteenth century, oil on canvas, equipment of the rotunda. It is commonly assumed that the patrons saint of the rotunda are St.Nicolaus and St. Wenceslas. In the document from 1223 in which a sacral object in Cieszyn is mentioned for the first time there is a following entry: ecclesia sancti Nicolai. It does not follow, however, that the church mentioned in the said document is the castle rotunda. Analysis of a few preserved written documents and the already recognised settling context seem to point to the fact that the church mentioned in the document by a bishop of Wroc≈Çaw from 1223 was located outside the stronghold, most probably within the borders of a pre-settlement hamlet. Therefore it is likely that in the first quarter of the 13th century there were at least two churches in Cieszyn - St. Nicolas church in the latter ‚Äúsuburbium‚Äù and the rotunda in the castellan‚Äôs stronghold. It is worth mentioning that in 1495 a parson of Pszczyna, Wac≈Çaw Hynal from Stonawa funded an altar of the Divine Providence, Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, Saint Erasmus and Saint Wenceslas. In later documents the rotunda as the castle chapel is mentioned as having saint Wenceslas as its patron saint. Also, preserved documents from the 18th century (urbaria) confirm Saint Wenceslas as its patron saint. Conflict between Poland and Czech Republic concerning Cieszyn Silesia in 1919 - 1920 has contributed to progressive removal of St. Wenceslas as a Czech element, without paying attention to the fact that St. Wenceslas not only is the patron saint of Bohemia , but in 1436 he was established as one of the four major patrons saint of the Kingdom of Poland by cardinal Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki.  Holy Masses  Holy Masses are celebrated once a year - on December 6 - on St. Nicolas.  Trivia  The Rotunda of Cieszyn as one of the oldest monuments of Polish architecture is depicted on the current Polish 20 PLN banknote.

He worked at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and served as chair of the department of medicine for 36 years. Seldin has been referred to as the \\"intellectual father of UT Southwestern Medical Center\\", and transformed a school housed in a dilapidated barracks into a world renowned medical center. He is noted for his contributions to medical ethics and research in kidney function. Early life and education Seldin was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 24, 1920. His father was an immigrant from Bessarabia, and his mother's parents immigrated from Vienna prior to her birth. He grew up during the Great Depression, and worked while in school delivering groceries. He had one sister, who died at age 27. He graduated from high school at age 16, and studied literature at New York University, receiving his bachelors of arts in 1940. He graduated from Yale University School of Medicine in 1943. In 1943, he married Muriel Goldberg. After her death in 1994, he married Ellen Lee Taylor, a physician. He has three children from his first marriage. Seldin died of lymphoma in 2018.  Career  Seldin served as a captain in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1946 to 1948, where he served as the chief of medicine and ran the laboratory at the 98th General Hospital, a military hospital in Germany. While there, he was called to Dachau to testify at the trial of a Nazi physician accused of human experimentation resulting in the deaths of 40 prisoners. The doctor, who had trained at The Rockefeller University, defended himself at the trial. Seldin testified for three days, and the doctor was sentenced to death. He attributed his interest in medical ethics to this experience. After his military service, he worked as a professor at Yale University until 1951. In 1951, Seldin was recruited to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, where he worked for 67 years. When Seldin joined UT Southwestern, it was the newest medical center in the country, and was housed in a dilapidated army barracks. When he arrived, Seldin described it as \\"shacks and trash\\", with holes in the floor and broken windows. Within 6 months, the physician who recruited him left, leaving him as the only full-time faculty member of the medical center, and earning him the position of chair by default. The school was placed on probation by the accrediting agency. He served as chair of the department of medicine from 1952 to 1988. He was credited with greatly increasing the stature of the institution and recruiting top faculty. Many of the students and faculty he recruited have become leaders in medicine, including Dan Foster, Jean Wilson, Kern Wildenthal, Roland Blantz, Floyd Rector, Helen Hobbs, John Fordtran, John Dietschy, and Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein, who together won the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He also trained over 200 residents in the field of nephrology with at UTSW. During his leadership, the once-decaying school was transformed into a world-class medical center with five Nobel laureates and an endowment of more than $1 billion. In the 1970s, Seldin served as a Commissioner on the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects, which published the Belmont Report, which dictates standards ethical behavior of researchers involving humans. During the course of his career, Seldin was the president of seven major professional societies: the Central Society for Clinical Research, the Southern Society of Clinical Investigation, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the American Society of Nephrology, the Association of Professors of Medicine, the Association of American Physicians, and the International Society of Nephrology. He was a founder of the American Society of Nephrology. In 1974, he was elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. = Research = Seldin has been recognized for his research in the field of nephrology. A 1990 book on the history of the National Kidney Foundation states that \\"Nephrology in the United States is what it is today because one day, many years ago, Donald W. Seldin decided to make it his major area of interest.\\" He and Robert Tarail first described how glucose behaves as a solute causing water to exit cells due to the change in concentration gradient in uncontrolled diabetes. He is known as an author of one of the fundamental textbooks in Nephrology, Seldin and Giebisch's The Kidney. In collaboration with others, he has published research on a variety of topics in the field of nephrology, including the factors affecting acid-base homeostasis, the role of the kidney in determining osmolarity and volume of blood, and the basic functions of renal tubules.  Awards and honors  UT Southwestern's Seldin Plaza is named in his honor, and a 7-foot statue of him is displayed there. UTSW has named several professorships for him: the Donald W. Seldin Distinguished Chair in Internal Medicine, the Donald W. Seldin Professorship in Clinical Investigation, and the Sinor-Pritchard Professorship in Medical Education Honoring Donald W.

She is the founder and co-CEO of the Dart Group, now known as 42West, which prior to its 2017 acquisition was the largest independently-owned public relations firm in the entertainment industry. Dart's work has been focused on both actors and filmmakers since the start of her career. She has represented actors including Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Daniel Day-Lewis, Tom Hanks, and Jessica Lange, and directors Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Mike Nichols, Woody Allen, and Sydney Pollack. Dart directed the publicity campaigns for the Academy Award-winning films Lincoln, No Country for Old Men, The Departed and Chicago, among others. Early life and education An only child, Dart was born and raised in Los Angeles. She attended the University of Southern California, where she initially studied fine arts. After her father suggested she consider journalism or public relations, she enrolled at the USC School for Communications. She graduated with a degree in public relations in 1976. Career =Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Rogers and Cowan= Dart worked briefly in corporate PR after her graduation, first as an in-house publicist, and later on behalf of corporate clients at an agency. In 1977, she was hired by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. While working on the Academy Awards, she met Warren Cowan, the co-founder of Rogers & Cowan. A \\"mastermind of the modern day Oscar campaign,\\" he incorrectly assumed Dart had established relationships and hired her on the spot. Dart was mentored by Cowan as well as Sam Cohn, who would later introduce her to directors. =PMK= At 28, Dart partnered with Pat Kingsley and Lois Smith to form the PR agency PMK, the successor to Smith and Kingley's firm Pickwick/Maslansky/Koenigsberg. She moved from Los Angeles to New York to head the New York office of PMK in 1983, and became an owner of the company with Kingsley and Smith in 1985. During her 23-year tenure at the agency, it became the leading PR firm in entertainment. Revenue increased from $1.5 million to $14 million annually, as the PMK roster grew to more than 200 clients. In 2001 a photo of Dart, Kingsley and Smith ran in the \\"Legends of Hollywood\\" issue of Vanity Fair with the caption \\"Not since the heyday of MGM have three little letters wielded so much power.\\" In 2004, The New York Times wrote: \\"With the explosion in media interest in celebrity over the last decade, publicists have become a power center in their own right. For many years, Ms. Kingsley, based in Los Angeles, and Ms. Dart, her New York-based partner in privately held PMK, were indisputably the most influential among them.\\" PMK was sold to advertising company Interpublic in 1999, and its focus shifted away from Hollywood talent toward high-paying corporate clients. Dart brokered partnerships with brands such as Coca-Cola and General Motors, but said in a 2004 interview with Newsweek that her \\"passion\\" was always for filmmakers and talent. As the concentration on brands intensified, Kingsley and Dart became increasingly estranged. In November 2004, Kingsley fired Dart, then the president of PMK, stating that her contract would not be renewed. It was reported that Dart's dismissal was based on a protracted power struggle, a \\"succession drama\\" between Kingsley, then 72, and Dart, more than 20 years her junior. Dart's termination and the resulting departure of talent from PMK was a major media story, with New York writing that \\"the ultimate test for any publicist is spinning her own dismissal, and this Leslee Dart has done masterfully.\\" =The Dart Group, 42 West= The weekend after she was fired from PMK, Dart established the Dart Group, working with one assistant from a midtown Manhattan hotel room. The filmmakers and actors who left PMK for the Dart Group included Demme, Hanks, Jessica Lange and Mike Nichols. In 2006 the Dart Group was renamed 42 West. As the company expanded, its roster grew to include musicians. It was acquired in March 2017 by Dolphin Digital Media.

Nazi influence in Germany grew exponentially after the German Federal Elections in 1932 and 1933, coinciding with the appointment of Adolf Hitler, the head of the Nazi Party, as Chancellor in November 1932. The strict racial policies of the Nazis began to take effect after Adolf Hitler gained power though the Enabling Act, passed by the German Parliament in March 1933. By the time of the 1932 Olympics the Nazis were so much opposed to international competition that the International Olympic Committee sent its German member Karl Ritter von Halt to Hitler to reaffirm that the Games could take place at all in case the Nazis were in government. Hitler mainly said that international obligations were being kept, but did not show any enthusiasm for the Games. During 1933 Hitler's position changed and as of October 1933 the Games were seen by Hitler as a time to show the strength of the new Nazi Germany to the world;The reason for this shift is discussed in more detail by Kr√ºger, Arnd: ‚ÄúHeute geh√∂rt uns Deutschland und morgen...‚Äù?

The Nazi Olympics. University of Illinois Press. 2003. . page 20.  Nazi Party views on sports and athletics  1933 marked the beginning of Hitler's consolidation of power. He was the F√ºhrer of the Third Reich, seeing himself as the destined leader of the German people. This consolidation meant that every aspect of the Nazi government would lead to him. However, when it came to hosting the Olympics, there were no separate Nazi sports organizations. Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda Minister, was of the opinion that simply gaining power was only part of the process in creating the new German state; the Nazis needed to win the heart of the people. Sports were crucial to this success, as according to him it would \\"strengthen the character of the German people, imbuing it with the fighting spirit and steadfast camaraderie necessary in the struggle for its existence\\". Eventually Goebbels' ministry had eleven sections dedicated to athletics. Jewish athletes were expelled from all organized athletics, as mandated by the German Olympic Committee.  Organization and propaganda  Invitations to the Games were sent out to the Olympic Committees of various countries. Publicly, in sports and athletics Hitler had no stated policies about athletes and competitors, but his racism had caused worry among members of the IOC. Finland and Italy were the first to accept. Support for the Games within Germany was heavily sought after by Joseph Goebbels. He believed that every German should share in the responsibility of presenting the Games to the rest of the world. Goebbels' Ministry promoted the Olympics with colorful posters and athletic imagery, drawing a link between Nazi Germany and ancient Greece. Leni Reifenstahl, the film maker behind Triumph of the Will (1934), was employed and created a controversial documentary titled Olympia (1938) about the Summer Games. Elaborate plans were created and constructed, including a new stadium as well as a state-of-the-art Olympic Village. Hitler placed the full resources of the state behind the Olympic preparations. Goebbels and the Nazi regime covered up their violent, racist policies throughout the Games by removing anti-Semitic signs and toning back rhetoric of newspapers. Orders were made to allow foreign visitors to bypass certain laws and not be subjugated to Nazi homophobic laws. Tourists were mainly unaware of the change in the political atmosphere, thus the Nazi regime was successful in bypassing foreign scrutiny of their racial policies. The Games were exploited by Hitler and his Party, and spectators and journalists from around the world were presented with the fraudulent image of a tolerant and peaceful Germany. = Foreign appeasement = The International Olympic Committee as well the Committees of several countries, attempted to rectify the racial issues in Germany. Henri de Baillet-Latour, the President of the IOC, was aware of the German sports authorities and the restrictive training possibilities for 'non-Aryans'. Boycott movements around the world surfaced in the United States, Great Britain, France, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and the Netherlands, as rumors of Nazi racism spread. Fierce debate occurred in the United States, causing some worry to the Nazis. The United States traditionally sends one of the largest teams to the games, generating interest and tourism. Many individual Jewish athletes boycotted the games or their country's qualifying trials. However, Baillet-Latour continued to support the German Olympic Committee, and reassured foreign visitors to the Nazi Games that they would, \\"receive a cordial welcome without the risk of experiencing anything which might offend their principles\\". The boycott movement eventually failed.  Jewish athletes excluded from participation  The 'Aryans only' policies in Nazi Germany caused many world-class athletes to be left out of competitions. Jews or individuals with Jewish parents were systematically excluded from German sports facilities and associations. What follows is a short list of specific athletes banned from representing their country in world events. * Erich Seelig, Boxer, expelled from the German Boxing Association * Daniel Prenn, Tennis, removed from Germany's Davis Cup Team, and banned from international competition * Gretel Bergmann, High Jump, expelled from her German Club in 1933, and from the National Team in 1936 = German placation = Helene Mayer, a fencer, was allowed on the German National team in order to appease international opinion. She herself was not Jewish, but she was viewed as 'non-Aryan' because her father was Jewish. She went on to win a silver medal, and on the podium, proceeded to give the Nazi salute.

She was posthumously awarded the Order of Glory 1st class on 29 June 1945, making her one of only four women to be awarded all three classes of the award. Civilian life Petrova was born in 1893 to a Russian family in Lomonsov within the Russian Empire. Her father was an officer in the Russian navy but died shortly after the family moved to St. Petersburg. Her mother was left to raise the five children by herself, so after completing secondary school Nina enrolled in trade school. Three years later the family moved to Vladivostok where Nina worked as an accountant during the day and went to school at night. Later she moved to Revel and found employment at a shipyard. During the 1917 revolution she was a resident of Lodeynoye Pole in the St. Petersburg Oblast but moved to the city of Leningrad with her daughter in 1927. There she worked as a gym teacher and was active in various sports including horseback riding, cycling, rowing, swimming, basketball, skiing, hockey, and skating. From 1934 to 1935 she was the team captain of the Leningrad Military District women's ice hockey team. After improving her sharpshooting skills she entered a sniper school and became a certified sniper instructor. Military career Petrova fought in the Soviet- Finnish War before volunteering for service in the German-Soviet War. Initially she served in the 4th Division of the Leningrad People's Militia before entering a medical battalion, even though she was too old to be drafted. In November 1941 she transferred to fight as a sniper in the 1st Infantry Battalion of the 284th Infantry Regiment of the 86th Tartu Rifle Division, where she rose through the ranks to sergeant-major (starshina). In the Battle of Leningrad she trained other soldiers of the Red Army as snipers in addition to participating in direct combat. On 16 January 1944 in the village of Zarudiny in the Leningrad Oblast she took out an enemy communications officer and another soldier. Her position was discovered and she managed to retreat to a different position and shot three more before it was attacked. From January to March 1944 she took out 23 enemy soldiers and was awarded the Order of Glory 3rd class on 2 March 1944 for her actions in Leningrad. For her actions in Leningrad she was awarded the Medal For Battle Merit and the Medal For the Defence of Leningrad. In early August 1944 while fighting on the 3rd Baltic Front she fought in a battle near the Lepassaare railway station in Estonia. During those combat engagements she killed an additional twelve enemy soldiers for which she was awarded the Order of Glory 2nd class. While fighting on the 2nd Belorussian Front in the battle for the control of Elbing in February 1945 she provided cover to her unit by attacking enemy positions with sniper fire, killing 32 enemy soldiers in that engagement and bringing her kill tally to 100 with her victories in Leningrad, Lepassaare, and other battles. For her actions in Elbing she was nominated to be awarded the Order of Glory 1st Class but did not live to receive it. She was killed in action on 1 May 1945, just days before the end of the war, when a mortar attack pushed her off a cliff. Throughout her career she trained 512 other snipers, killed 122 enemy soldiers, and took three enemy combatants hostage.

It is located in the city centre, on Szersznika street.  History  Initially at the location of the church there was a chapel built in 1648, which was given to Jesuits after their arrival in Cieszyn in 1670. Franciscans found many supporters among the gentry of Cieszyn - one of them a starost Adam Wac≈Çaw Paczy≈Ñski built a sacristy and a pulpit and in 1712 he sponsored the construction of a monastery school (that was to be managed by Jesuits) for 16 poor children of the nobility who intended to study in Cieszyn. The chapel could house approx. 500 worshippers and in 1707, when Jesuit preaching became increasingly popular, it was converted into the Holy Cross Church. After the suppression of the Jesuit order in 1773 the church became a school church and was used mainly by pupils of Cieszyn grammar school. In 1791-92 father Leopold Szersznik supported extension of the church that was given, inter alia, a vaulting and a tower. After the fire in 1789, the Church was renovated in the baroque style. It was then when a new main altar was created in the Classicistic style with bas-relief showing the Crucifixion and the Last Supper. The church was renewed many times during the nineteenth and twentieth century and one major renovation took place in 1862 and involved alteration of the church tower. In 1773 the Jesuit order was suppressed. The Jesuit residence in Cieszyn was sold, the grammar school was taken over by the state and the Holy Cross Church was converted into a grammar school church. Its supervisor became father Szersznik, who in 1782 vaulted the interior and built a tower with a helmet and an octagonal lantern. Also, it was he who managed the reconstruction of the church after the fire in 1789. In 1794 according to the plans of Andreas Kaspar Schweigl (currently without a superstructure). Most probably two side altars and a pulpit are of his design. A late baroque gallery was constructed as well. Initially the church belonged to the parish of Saint Maria Magdalene up to 2005. Then it was leased to the order of St. Francis, which had a retreat centre in the neighbouring building of the former Jesuit monastery. Currently the monastery and the church belong to the Province of the Assumption of Virgin Mary of the Order of Minor Brothers in Katowice.  Architecture  Holy Cross Church is built in a late Baroque style. It has one nave, three bays and is built on a rectangular plan. The nave of the church (with a tower in the middle) is closed by an apse behind which a sacristy, a former sacristy and a shed are located. On the ground floor there is a church porch opened to the nave by three arcades with a basket arch in stucco framework. The wall of the nave is divided by pillars with hollow corners embraced by Ionian pilasters and semi-pilasters. An old Baroque main altar, Baroque-classicistic pulpit and a Baroque music gallery survived until today. The altar part is oriented to the North and vaulted hemispherically with lunettes. The vaults of the church are of a sail shape and are separated by broad straps. There is a barrel vaulting with a segment arch in the sacristy, and in the former sacristy a barrel vaulting is enriched by lunettes. In the nave and the presbytery there is a nineteenth-century marble flooring with a two-colour theme. Pictures of Crucifixion (the main altar) and Virgin Mary (the side altar) are from the 18th and 19th century. Late Baroque fa√ßade of the 18th century has three axes and has been divided by Ionian pilasters. On its axis there is a stone portal topped with a basket arch with a sinuous fronton. Over the portal one can see a window closed by a basket arch with a putta head in a keystone. The fa√ßade is decorated by figures of Saint Francis of Assisi and St Joseph with Baby Jesus (located in the hemispherically vaulted niches), most probably due to the person of the emperor Francis Joseph I, listed on the renovation plague inside the church on the left hand side from the entrance. In the church there is also a wooden Baroque gallery, built after 1784 and a Baroque pulpit in the Baroque and classicistic style. The upper level of the fa√ßade is separated from a gable and one-piece roof by a pedestal behind which a square tower with dials can be seen. In the corners of the tower composite pilasters were created. On the axis of the tower there is an oval window above which on four sides windows are placed closed by a semi- circular arch. The helmet of the tower is made of four pieces and has an octagonal lantern. In the side facade of the nave there is a big window closed by an overhung semi-circular arch with broad frames and keystones. The fa√ßade of the presbytery part is embraced by pilasters with windows in two climes.  Holy Masses  Holy mass is celebrated on the following days: Sundays and holy days of obligation: 10.00 A.M. and 7.00 P.M. from Monday to Saturday: 9.00 For the youth: during a school year on Tuesdays at 7.00 P.M.

Like traditional grafting, there is a combination the hardy characteristics of a rootstock with the desired fruit of the budded region; however, micro- budding is done at a younger age, and because of apical hormonal dominance, the resulting citrus trees grow faster and bear fruit at an earlier stage (2 years) than traditional T-budded grafted trees (5 years to fruit).Alam, Naeem, et al. ‚ÄúEarly Age Propagation of Three Commercial Citrus Species Through Microbudding Technique‚Äù Researchgate.net, Pakistan Journal of Agricultural Sciences, 1 Mar. 2006, www.researchgate.net/publication/242585595_early_age_propagation_of_three_commercial_citrus_species_through_microbudding_technique It was developed in 1997 by Dr. Mani Skaria, a citrus scientist (retired) from the Texas A&M; University - Kingsville Citrus Center.Santa Ana, Rod. ‚ÄúSkaria Honored for Novel Contributions to the Citrus Industry.‚Äù Themonitor.com, The Monitor, 27 Feb. 2016, www.themonitor.com/news/business/article_3c88ab30-e420-11e5-ad9e-e7f4116b1036.html.

With contribution from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. JHU Press. pp. 236‚Äì246. The General Government represented the middle portion of occupied Poland, with originally the West being under German control and the East under Soviet control. The basis for this split was to eliminate the Polish state and to turn all Polish nationals as stateless subjects, disregarding international law. The administration of the General Government was run exclusively by German officials. There was no national Polish influence. The purpose of this was to reduce the status of the Polish nationals to virtual serfdom. This was one of the first steps toward ethnic cleansing in Poland. Hans Frank, the first General-Governor, told Adolf Hitler that his intention with the occupation was to make it a completely German-occupied area within the next 10 to 15 years. \\"Where 12 million Poles now live, is to be populated by 4 to 5 million Germans,\\" said Frank.Keith Bullivant, Geoffrey J. Giles, Walter Pape (1999). Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identities and Cultural Differences. pp. p. 32. There were many different plans formulated for the fate of the Poles living in German-occupied Poland. Among the most common were calls for deportations of the Polish population to Western Siberia. However, in most cases \\"deportation\\" was a euphemism for execution of the Polish population. In the meantime, all educational institutions, besides primary schools, and cultural centres were closed in Poland to exclude Polish nationals from cultural, intellectual, and economic life in the General Government.Segal, Simon, and Raymond Leslie Buell (1942). The New Order in Poland. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. pp. 4‚Äì5. The General Government had no international recognition and also did not allow Polish nationals any representation. This gave the General Government a lot of freedom to implement their own policies without consequence. Because of this freedom, many of the basic rights of Polish nationals were violated, their property rights among them.  Polish economy  Forced labor was expected of Jews and Polish nationals living in the General Government after the invasion of Poland in 1939. These laborers were deported to Germany where they worked on German farms and in German factories. Polish citizens who were considered to have special talents, or were otherwise useful to Nazi Germany, were kidnapped and sent to Germany. This \\"brain drain\\" left Poland's economy in ruins. Agricultural exports increased during this time. However, this was primarily due to food rationing in Poland, rather than increased production. = Bank Of Issue in Poland = The Bank of Issue in Poland was a bank created by the Germans in the General Government in 1940.Jerzy Jan Lerski, Piotr Wr√≥bel, Richard J. Kozicki, (1996). Historical Dictionary of Poland. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 26. As a result, Polish banks and credit institutions were closed, their assets nationalized by the General Government. This meant that many polish nationals lost their entire savings. The bank's main functions included issuing currency, supplying short term loans, and taking deposits.Morawski, Wojciech. Bankoteca. pp. 32‚Äì36. The new currency printed by the bank was called z≈Çoty, and it was given no backing. Because of this, the currency suffered from increasing inflation during the time of occupation. For reference, the z≈Çoty's exchange rate with the American dollar doubled by the end of the war period. The bank was also assigned the task of accumulating as much capital as it could, which would then be put back into the German economy. This capital was also used to finance the German army. = Seizure of Polish property = After the invasion of Poland in 1939, both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany seized the property of the Poles and the Jews living in the occupied territory. The value of this lost property is estimated to have been around $8 billion in 1942 currency values.Martin, Dean (2008). Robbery and Restitution: The Conflict over Jewish Property in Europe. Berghahn Books. pp. 1‚Äì7. One of the most commonly looted was Poland's cultural artifacts, including over half a million art pieces. Among these cultural artifacts were also many books and archives. This sparked the creation of many well-known German collecting agencies. Polish state property was given directly to the General Government. An institution entitled the Trust Office (Treuh√§ndstelle) was introduced by Nazi Germany in 1939. Its purpose was to assume state companies, all private property and companies important to defense, and then all estates and farmsteads that belonged to Jews and ‚Äòenemies of the Reich‚Äô. This property was then handed to a trustee, who in return gave a significant percentage of their income back to the Trust Office in compensation. The most valuable possessions and companies were given directly to Germans. In some cases, former owners were allowed to remain working at their plants or living in their homes. However, in most cases former owners were simply kicked out. Many Poles were deported to ghettos after the German invasion. Over 1000 ghettos were created by the Germans in occupied territories. The largest ghetto was in Warsaw, Poland and held almost half a million Jews. After their deportations, Germans would confiscate their property and sell it or send it back to Germany. = Restitution = The conflict over restitution of property to these victims of the holocaust took place primarily in two periods, 1945, with the end of World War II, and in 1990. In 1943, 18 signatory states of the London Inter-Allied Declaration declared null and void all German expropriation measures in occupied territories and that any transfer of property was to be reversed with the conclusion of the war, whether or not the property was transferred by legal transaction or by looting or theft. Unfortunately, many former owners of the seized property were murdered or had fled to neighboring countries. This limited the restitution process. This heirless property became a point of contention within these communities. Many fought over the right to these heirless properties and many worried that the significance of these properties was surpassing the importance of restoring individual rights to those who had suffered. Another problem with restitution was that many countries had established that only citizens of the country where the property was resituted could make a claim. However, many of the people who had fled their home countries during the war had lost their citizenship, disqualifying them from claiming their own property. In 1990 there was a revamping of the restitution process. This included the creation of The World Jewish Restitution Organization designed to represent the best interests of many different Jewish organizations. The European Union played a big role in putting pressure specifically on Eastern countries to return property still in their countries. In 1998 there was a Conference of Holocaust-Era Assets in Washington, D.C. The commissions, which included 23 countries, researched what had happened to stolen property during the war. This same year Swiss banks agreed to $1.25 billion in compensation to future claimants. The German Chancellor, in an attempt to make amends to forced laborers, created the foundation, \\"Remembrance, Responsibility, and Future.\\" There continue to be efforts to return the individual rights to victims of the holocaust today. An example is the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016. The purpose of the act is \\"to provide the victims of Holocaust-era persecution and their heirs a fair opportunity to recover works of art confiscated or misappropriated by the Nazis.\\" See also * General Government * Invasion of Poland * Timeline of World War II * Timeline of Polish history  References  Category:1939 in Poland Category:Chronology of World War II Category:General Government Invasion of Poland ","title":"Money transfers in the Generalgouvernement"},{"id":"57315965","text":"Rajbiraj Airport is a domestic airport located in Rajbiraj serving Saptari District, a district in Province No. 2 in Nepal.https://www.aviationnepal.com/shree-airlines-to-conduct-test-flight-for- rajbiraj-airport-with-crj-aircraft/ After 11 years of complete shut down, the airport resumed its operations on 23 May 2018 with a Shree Airlines test flight.

She showed very promising form as a two-year-old in 1949 when she won two races and finished second in the Prix de la Salamandre. She reached her peak in the first half of the following year when she won the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and the 1000 Guineas before recording an emphatic victory in the Epsom Oaks. She made little impact when competing in the United States as a four-year-old. She had some success as a broodmare. Background Impudence was a brown mare with a small white star bred in France by Pierre Corbiere. She was sent into training with Joseph Lieux. The filly raced in the colours of Pierre Corbiere's wife. She was sired by who won the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud and was placed in the Prix du Jockey Club, Grand Prix de Paris and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Imprudence's dam, the British-bred Indiscretion was an influential broodmare whose other descendants included Definite Article, Rakti and Holding Court. Racing career =1946: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old in 1946 Imprudence ran three times and won two races. She produced her best performance in defeat when she finished second to Catalina in the Prix de la Salamandre over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in September. =1947: three-year-old season= Imprudence recorded her first major victory in April 1947 when she won the 1600 metre Poule d'Essai des Pouliches from Montenica and Djama. She was then sent to England to contest the 134th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 2 May and stated the 4/1 favourite in a 20-runner field. Ridden by the Australian jockey Rae Johnstone she won by a neck and a head from Rose o' Lynn and Wild Child. Imprudence was back in England on 5 June and, with Johnstone again in the saddle, started the 7/4 favourite for the 169th Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. Wild Child was again in opposition but the best fancied of her the opponents were Solpax (Lingfield Oaks Trial), Mermaid and Netherton Maid (Princess Elizabeth Stakes). Imprudence came home five lengths clear of Netherton Maid, with two lengths back to Mermaid in third. In August Imprudence was matched against older horses in the Prix Jacques Le Marois over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse and finished second to the Prix Lupin winner Djelal. =1948: four-year-old season= In 1948 Imprudence was bought by Harry Frank Guggenheim and sent to the United States where she raced in the colours of Cain Hoy Stable and was known as Imprudence II. She failed to win in five starts, producing her best effort when second to Camargo in the Molly Pitcher Stakes on 31 July at Monmouth Park. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Imprudence an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas and an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks. The Prix Imprudence run at Maisons-Laffitte, is named in her honour. Breeding record Impudence was retired from racing to become a broodmare in the United States. She produced at least nine foals and four winners between 1951 and 1967: *Hot Pursuit, a chestnut colt (later gelded), foaled in 1951, sired by Requested.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species is classified as Nationally Endangered by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  C. paterna was described by Alfred Philpott in 1926 using a male specimen collected by Stuart Lindsay on the 31 March 1923. George Vernon Hudson illustrated the type specimen of the moth in his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. Although the type locality given by Philpott is Little River, evidence suggests that this locality is incorrect. The genus level classification of New Zealand endemic moths within the genus Cnephasia is regarded as unsatisfactory and is under revision. As such the species is currently also known as Cnephasia (s.l.) paterna. The type specimen is held at Canterbury Museum.  Description  Philpott described the species as follows:  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand and has only been found in the South Island. The type specimen remained unique until the species was rediscovered by Brian Patrick on the 28 May 2012 at Saddle Hill, Banks Peninsula. This locality remains the only site where this species has been found.  Habitat  The rediscovery of the species occurred on south-eastern slopes at an altitude of 750-800m amongst the snow tussock Chionochloa rigida.  Life history and biology  Much information on biology and life cycle of this moth is yet to be discovered and the species has not yet been reared. Patrick hypothesises that the larvae of this species feed in silken tunnels and that they have an annual life-cycle. Adults emerge in the late autumn or early winter. Hudson records the insect being collectable at the end of March. The female of this species is short wings and flightless, which inhibits the dispersal of the species. The male of the species are active during the day and are regarded as fast flyers.  Conservation status  This species has been classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Endangered.

Initially intended to protect the city from attacks by Ottoman Muslim Albanian warbands, it became an instrument of Haseki's tyrannical rule over the city. History The 1770s were a period of lawlessness and disorder in southern Greece, particularly due to the presence of roving Ottoman-Albanian warbands, that had been brought in by the Porte to suppress the Orlov Revolt in the Morea in 1770. In In 1778, such a warband arrived in Attica, and sent emissaries to Athens, threatening to burn the city unless they received provisions and an official document hiring them as guards of the city. The Ottoman governor, Hadji Ali Haseki, and the Athenian populace, both Christians and Muslims, resolved to meet the Albanians in the field, as the city was unfortified except for the Acropolis. In a battle that took place near Halandri, the Athenians defeated the Albanians. To secure the city against another attack, Haseki immediately began construction of a new city wall. Work had not progressed far when a second and far larger force of 6,000 Albanians approached, under a certain Maksut, on their way to the Morea. The Turks then abandoned the city and found refuge in the Acropolis, while Haseki allowed the Greeks to move to Salamis Island for safety. There they remained for 13 days, until the Albanians departed, after receiving a substantial sum as a bribe. Construction on the wall resumed with increased vigour: Haseki not only enlisted the entire population of the city without distinction, but himself participated in the work, so that the 10 km long wall was completed in 108 days, or, according to other reports, in only 70 days. Many ancient and medieval monuments were demolished and reused as building material (spolia) in the process. Haseki then promptly presented the Athenians with a bill for 42,500 piastres, ostensibly for the supervisors he had brought from outside. Not only that, but he placed guards at the gates, so that the wall served to virtually imprison the population in their own city. During and after the Ottoman siege of Athens in 1826, the wall was reduced to ruins, like most of the city; its remains were demolished in 1834. Description The hastiness of the construction resulted in a wall only about high and less than thick, rather than a proper fortification. The course of the wall was as follows: from the Odeon of Herodes Atticus at the foot of the Acropolis, it went to the Theatre of Dionysus, and thence to the Arch of Hadrian, whose lower portion was walled up. From there it followed the course of the modern Vasilissis Amalias Avenue to Syntagma Square, thence down Stadiou Street to the original headquarters of the National Bank of Greece. From there it turned west to Koumoundourou Square, passed in front of the Theseion, over the Areopagus, and arrived again at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus. The Boubounistra Gate with the namesake fountain in the background, painted by Edward Dodwell. The spolia from Hadrian's aqueduct are evident. The wall had seven gates: * the \\"Castle Gate\\" (Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒöŒ¨œÉœÑœÅŒøœÖ) or \\"Karababa\\" (Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒöŒ±œÅŒ¨ŒºœÄŒ±ŒºœÄŒ±) in front of the Acropolis, which led to the Muslim cemetery outside the wall (hence also Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ± œÑœâŒΩ ŒúŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ, \\"Gate of the Tombs\\"), and was rarely used * the \\"Mandravili Gate\\" (Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒúŒ±ŒΩœÑœÅŒ±Œ≤ŒØŒªŒ∑), after a local family, also known as \\"Drakos Gate\\" (Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒîœÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒøœÖ, ŒîœÅŒ±Œ∫œåœÄŒøœÅœÑŒ±) and in Turkish \\"Lion Gate\\" (Aslan Kapƒ±sƒ±), between the Theseion and the hill of the Pnyx, leading to the Piraeus * the \\"Morea Gate\\" (Mora Kapƒ±sƒ±) or \\"Gypsy Gate\\" (ŒìœçœÜœÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑ Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ±) in the area of the Kerameikos, named after the Gypsy ironsmiths in the area * the \\"Gate of Menidi\\" (ŒúŒµŒΩŒπŒ¥ŒπŒ¨œÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑ Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ±) in modern Aiolou Street, also known as the \\"Gate of the Holy Apostles\\" (Œ†œçŒªŒ∑ ŒëŒ≥ŒØœâŒΩ ŒëœÄŒøœÉœÑœåŒªœâŒΩ) from the nearby Byzantine-era Church of the Holy Apostles; as it led to Euboea, in Turkish it was known as \\"Gate of Euboea\\" (Eƒüriboz Kapƒ±sƒ±) * the \\"Mesogeia Gate\\" (ŒúŒµœÉŒøŒ≥ŒµŒØœÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑ Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ±, Mesoya Kapƒ±sƒ±), or \\"Boubounistra\\" (ŒúœÄŒøœÖŒºœÄŒøœÖŒΩŒØœÉœÑœÅŒ±), from the rushing sound of a local fountain, in Othonos Street * the walled-up \\"Gate of the Princess\\" (Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒøœÄŒøœçŒªŒ±œÇ) or \\"Arch Gate\\" (ŒöŒ±ŒºŒ±œÅœåœÄŒøœÅœÑŒ±), as the Arch of Hadrian was known * the \\"Albanian Gate\\" (ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒØœÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑ Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ±), in the mostly Arvanite-inhabited quarter of Plaka; it was also known as the \\"Three Towers Gate\\" (Œ†œåœÅœÑŒ± œÑœâŒΩ Œ§œÅŒπœéŒΩ Œ†œçœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ), and led to Phaleron and Cape Sounion References  Sources    * Category:City walls of Athens Category:Ottoman Athens Category:Infrastructure completed in 1778 Category:Ottoman fortifications in Greece Category:1770s in the Ottoman Empire Category:18th-century fortifications in Greece ","title":"Wall of Haseki"},{"id":"57316042","text":"Events in the year 2018 in Uruguay.

Known as 'Shotgun Charlie' as he was seldom without one in his hands in Angola, he was involved in the murder of at least 167 people during that conflict. Early life and career Christodoulou was born in Birmingham in the United Kingdom of Greek Cypriot parents and was believed to be a cousin of Costas Georgiou, known later as 'Colonel Callan', the leader of the British mercenaries in Angola. The two served together in the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in the British Army and toured in Northern Ireland. Georgiou was going out with Rona Angelo, Christodoulou's cousin. Unlike his felllow mercenaries Georgiou and Mick Wainwright, Christodoulou had been honourably discharged from the Army with the rank of Corporal,Mockler, Anthony.

In Angola he was known as \\"Shotgun Charlie\\", because he was never seen without a Spanish-made shotgun, which became his weapon of choice.Charlie Christodoulou - Imperial War Museum Oral History databaseScott Fitzsimmons, Mercenaries in Asymmetric Conflicts, Cambridge University Press (2013) - Google Books pg 110 Mercenary in Angola In 1991 Christodoulou was recruited in the Aldershot area by Nick Hall as a mercenary for the Angola War along with Georgiou and Michael Wainwright.Alan Axelrod, Mercenaries: A Guide to Private Armies and Private Military Companies- Google Books Described as a \\"withdrawn and easily led character\\", Christodoulou fought with the rank of CaptainMockler, p. 173Scott Fitsimmons, 'Culture Clash: The Influence of Behavioural Norms on Military Performance in Asymmetric Conflicts', Innovations: A Journal of Politics, Volume 8 ‚Äì 2008-2009 in Angola in 1976 for the FNLA. A ruthless and sadistic man disliked by all except Georgiou, his best friend, Christodoulou was one of the first three British mercenaries to land in Angola after Georgiou, arriving with his close friends Nick Hall and Michael Wainwright.Mockler, p. 170 Thanks to continuing recruitment in England, a somewhat larger mercenary contingent was formed, with the first contingent of mercenaries to arrive in Angola being mostly made up of professional soldiers. However, a full battalion was never realised. The enlarged force was still rather small relative to MPLA/Cuban forces, and many of the men were civilians with no military experience, and often refusing to submit to military discipline. This, combined with the foreign, Mediterranean origin of most of the core leadership, (Georgiou, Christodoulou and the Portuguese - although Christodoulou spoke with a Birmingham accent),Mockler, p. 181 created a deep gulf between the officers and the British other ranks ‚Äì to say nothing of the native Angolans recruited as infantry and support troops. Most of these had no military experience and many knew no English, or even Portuguese (then still the language of government and the native elite.) When the FNLA soldiers at Quiende barracks semi-mutinied Callan's now larger military force moved on their barracks where Callan and Christodoulou personally executed 20 of the ringleaders.Mockler, p. 182 Christodoulou would later boast to his friend Chris Dempster that he and Georgiou and their team had killed 167.5 FNLA mutineers and deserters. When Dempster asked, 'Why point five?' Christodoulou replied, 'One of the prisoners brought for execution at Quiende Bridge the other night had a lucky escape. He was bound hand and foot and had a pistol put to his head. But the weapon didn't fire. The gun was re-cocked but it jammed again. The poor bastard was terrified. He jumped off the bridge. We sprayed bullets into the water but since it was unconfirmed whether he was hit, and just in case he could swim with his hands and feet tied, we decided it was only fair to classify him as \\"half dead\\"'. After 14 British recruits were murdered by firing squad by Callan and his force for desertion Holden Roberto decided he should be dismissed from his command and court-martialled. Roberto and five mercenaries flew to Maquela to carry out this mission where they were met at the airport by Christodoulou, shotgun in hand. He was disarmed with riflebutt blows to the face while shouting, \\"I wasn't even effing there!\\" At a drumhead court-martial Christodoulou was acquitted of mass murder but found guilt of 'unmilitary behaviour', stripped of his rank and sentenced to serve six months at the front without pay. His colleague Sammy Copeland was found guilty and sentenced to immediate execution.Mockler, pp. 202-203 To some present Christodoulou's lenient sentence seemed ludicrous considering the number of atrocities he was guilty of in Angola, and one mercenary named Peter McAleese argued unsuccessfully with Roberto to reverse the sentences and execute Christodoulou as a warning to others. Roberto confirmed the original verdicts and sentences. However, British mercenary Andrew Black on his return to the United Kingdom made the unverified claim that all 14 murders were the work of \\"the cold- blooded killer\\" Christodoulou alone.'I Accuse Shotgun Charlie' - Daily Mirror, 11 February 1976, p. 1 Death On 14 February 1976 Christodoulou heard reports that the enemy were 40 miles away and went with two British and two American mercenaries in a landrover to investigate.Mockler, p. 208 Christodoulou was killed instantly by heavy automatic fire in an ambush.David Tomkins, Dirty Combat: Secret Wars and Serious Misadventures, Mainstream Publishing (2008) - Google BooksEx-Paras in Angola - Kriegsreisende website Christodoulou was a cold-blooded killer and was involved in the murder of at least 167 members of the FNLA.
