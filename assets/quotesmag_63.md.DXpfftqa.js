It is distributed extensively throughout various subtropical geographical areas including Australia, South Africa, Oriental Asia, and the Americasnot found in Europe or South Africa. The phenotypic traits of the female spiders include a large spherical abdomen with a milky white base often covered in darker brown patterns and a smaller brown carapace. In terms of relative size of the species, an extreme sexual size dimorphism allows for a clear distinction between the two sexes where the female is much larger. Although both sexes hatch with their cephalothorax range being around 0.5 mm, the female develops into a significantly larger specimen than her male counterpart. The size difference coheres with the divergence of their respective hunting behaviors. While female bolas spiders hang from a horizontal thread waiting to swing her bolas or sticky orb towards her nearby prey (typically moths), the males do not use a bolas but rather implement hunting tactics reminiscent of early- instar spiders. Along with a bolas, the female exploits a unique ability that allows her to aggressively mimic the pheromone composition of moths awaiting to mate to attract male prey.  Population Structure, Speciation, and Phylogeny  The M. hutchinsoni are part of the Mastophora species within the larger Araineida or orb-weaver family. They are in the Arthropoda phylum, the Arachnida class, and the Araneae order. Originally stemming from normal orb weavers, the species adopted an alternative web design (the bolas). The Mastophora are widely distributed throughout the world in temperate climates except for in Euro Asia and South Africa. These species can be distinguished by extreme sexual dimorphism where the female grows nearly tenfold the size of the male.  Habitat and Distribution  The M. hutchinsoni primarily reside in the northeastern regions of North America near areas of a more temperate climate. The range of locations can be from Minnesota to New Hampshire. Their primary habitats where they nest or feed include shrubs or short trees which coincide with their hunting behavior and web production as leaves or twigs are necessary for residence outside of hours of predation or for the placement of egg sacs. Due to the limited range of prey affected by the female‚Äôs aggressive mimicry technique, the predator frequently moves to different locations according to prey availability. They do so by riding a silken thread that travels with the direction of the wind.  Diet  = Adult Female Diet = Lacinipolia renigera As a result of a highly specialized hunting technique that mimics the disparate chemical compositions of its prey, the hunting range for the M. hutchinsoni is limited to a couple families of male moths. The females typically hunt either Noctuidae moths consisting of the bristly cut- worm, bronzed cutworm, and smoky tetanolita or the bluegrass worm of the Pyralidae family during prime activity hours in the eveningresulting in a nocturnal hunting pattern. In particular, the Lacinipolia renigera (bristly cut-worm) constitute two-thirds of total prey biomass and together with the Tetanolita mynesalis (smoky tetanolita) make up to ninety percent of its overall diet.  Aggressive Pheromone Mimicry  Female M. hutchinsoni employ a specialized hunting tactic where she aggressively mimics the pheromones of moths to attract male moths near their bolas trap. Female moths produce a complex pheromone typically combining two compounds in a ratio specific to the species. This allows male moths to easily distinguish between mates of different species. The periods of activity for each moth are also different. For instance, the bristly cut-worm is active earlier in the night than the smoky tetanolita. Thus, the female spiders must adjust the level of chemicals produced to accommodate for different moths. = Spiderling Diet = Instead of producing bolas like adult females to capture their prey, the spiderlings remain motionless in the margins of leaves in shrubs or trees and wait to quickly ambush small flies that pass. In preparation for capture, the early-instar spiders extend both of their front legs which contain small bristles that aid in capture. These immature spiders also seem to attract male Psychoda using a mechanism near to or the same as aggressive chemical mimicry. = Adult Male Diet = The males also do not construct a bolas to capture. Although females lose the strong bristles on their front legsused to aid in captureafter maturation, the males retain such features. There are not many observations made on the predatory habits of the male, however there has been research that proved the reservation of juvenile tactics and association with the male and psychodid fly attractionthe main source of the male‚Äôs diet.  Webs  Bolas Web Design Dissimilar to many of the web designs constructed by its closely related species in the family of orb weavers, M. hutchinsoni do not form the typical two-dimensional orb web. Instead, the females primarily reside in a nearby leaf or plant while producing a single horizontal thread which they stay on and travel across during times of predation. At the terminal end, the spider forms an extremely adhesive orb which it quickly hurls in a circular pattern to capture flying prey. The bolas is much more efficient at capturing moths as it prevents the prey from escaping through shedding its scalesan escape mechanism that would otherwise work on typical orb webs. If there is no prey captured after a short while, the Mastophora brings the orb back and consumes it preparing to form another one to replace the former. Such behavior seems attributed to the short-term efficacy of the orb‚Äôs stickiness. Accordingly, after a single use of the bolas, the female must form another if willing to hunt more prey.  Parental Care  Bolas Spider egg sac with eggs inside The egg sacs of the M. hutchinsoni are spherical in shape with an extended stem typically surrounded by multiple protective layers and an off-white silk covering. The globose vessels have a diameter around 8 mm while the connected stem extends up to thirty-six millimeters. With regards to the placement of the egg sac, the base is attached to either a branch of twig.  Mating  While both sexes of the M. hutchinsoni emerge during the spring, the males normally develop much more quickly than females with around a couple of months in between their respective growth. While the males fully develop during the summer months, the females mature around the fall season. During this gap, the mature males often leave their webs and reside in the webs of developing females awaiting to mate.  Protective Coloration  Considering the extreme sexual dimorphism resulting in a noticeably large size, M. Hutchinsoni adult females fashion a more cryptic coloration with a white palette and dark brown patterns. Meanwhile, the male bolas spiders are much smaller with reddish-brown hue. Moreover, the female‚Äôs large globular abdomen allows it to resemble bird droppings sitting on leaves. The bolas spider makes use of this resemblance as a defensive mechanism to avoid encounters with potential predators.  Physiology  The female M. hutchinsoni have the ability to produce and emit a chemical mixture that duplicates the sex pheromones found in the female moths during the mating seasons of moth species. Pheromone blends of each moth species are unique and may interfere with each other resulting in reduced efficacy or complete failure mimicry. To accommodate such discrepancies, the bolas spider continuously produces a substandard blend of both pheromones elements and adjusts the amount of emission as time moves from one species‚Äô zone of activity to another. = Moth Pheromone = The pheromone compositions are unique to their respective species of moththis differentiation helps male moths recognize the correct mating partner. Accordingly, the pheromones usually contain a blend of multiple chemical components. The bristly cutworm which makes up the majority of the diet of the M. hutchinsoni emits a pheromone with (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate (Z9-14: Ac) and 3.8 percent (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecenyl acetate (ZE-9, 12-14: Ac). M. Meanwhile, Tetanolita mynesalis, the other main food source, emits a blend with two parts (3Z, 9Z)-(6S, 7R)-epoxy heneocosadiene and one part (3Z, 6Z, 9Z)-heneicosatrience). Nephelodes minians (the bronzed cutworm) holds a chemical composition consisting of a blend of (Z)-11-hexadecenal and (Z)-11- hexadecenyl acetate. M. hutchinsoni is not only able to synthesize the components of different chemical blends but also mimic the exact ratios. = Wing Vibration = Despite being nocturnal hunters, M. hutchinsoni have poor vision and rather rely on prey wing vibrations to trigger bolas construction.The female has tiny hairs on her legs that are sensitive to such vibrations. Using a cabbage looper moth as an intermediate wing vibration rate for the L.renigera and T. mynelasis, researchers found that the bolas spider constructed a bolas a few minutes after being exposed to wing vibrations.  Bites to Animals  The M. hutchinsoni females produce venom to fatally impair her prey. After the M. hutchinsoni successfully attracts and traps the moth prey on the sticky bolas, the spider quickly reels the moth to herself, paralyzes the moth with a venomous bite, and wraps the prey in an envelope of silk to preserve the meal. The venom of Mastophora is not recorded to be dangerous toward humans or large animals.

Background New Zealand Cricket established the Shell Conference in 1997 in response to two problems. First, the Shell Trophy (also known as the Plunket Shield), the first-class competition contested by the six major association teams, was becoming expensive to run in its double round robin format. Second, it was felt that the standard of New Zealand cricket would be improved by holding a competition in which the six teams combined to make three teams, and adding a team from overseas to make a four-team single round robin format. The three domestic teams were: * Northern Conference, which selected its players from Northern Districts and Auckland * Central Conference, which selected its players from Central Districts and Wellington * Southern Conference, which selected its players from Canterbury and Otago The overseas teams were Bangladesh in 1997-98 and Pakistan A in 1998-99. The format was abandoned after the 1998-99 season. In 2000-01 the Plunket Shield resumed its place as New Zealand‚Äôs only first-class competition, returning to its double round robin format. Playing record Southern Conference played eight first-class matches, winning four, drawing three and losing one. They played in both finals, drawing in 1997-98 and winning in 1998-99. They also played three List A matches, losing two with one no-result. 1997-98: Captained by Darrin Murray, Southern Conference beat Central Conference and Bangladesh and lost to Northern Conference in the round robin before drawing with Northern Conference in the final.

It has round or heart-shaped leaf and a tiny reddish purple flower. Unlike many others in the genus, the dorsal sepal does not cover the labellum. It is similar to C. incurvus but the flowers are smaller.Corybas despectans leaf  Description  Corybas despectans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single round or heart-shaped leaf long and wide. The leaf is green on the upper surface and silvery green on the lower side. There is a single erect, reddish purple flower with green or translucent areas, long and wide. The dorsal sepal is greenish grey, erect in the lower part then curves, long and wide and does not usually completely cover the labellum. The lateral sepals are about long, wide and joined at their bases before tapering to a fine tip. The petals are about long, wide, widest at the base then tapering to a thread-like tip. The labellum is longer than the dorsal sepal, long, wide and reddish with obvious veins. Flowering occurs from June to September.  Taxonomy  Corybas despectans was first formally described in 1976 by David Jones and R.C. Nash from a specimen collected near Warooka and the description was published in Muelleria. The specific epithet (despectans) is a Latin word meaning \\"look down upon\\". In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed splitting Corybas into smaller genera and placing this species into Corysanthes but the change has not been widely accepted.

Sextus] Attius Labeo was a Roman senator, who held a number of imperial appointments during the middle of the second century AD. He was suffect consul in the year 146, following the death of Sextus Erucius Clarus in March, serving until the end of June; his colleague was Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus.Werner Eck, \\"Die Fasti consulares der Regungszeit des Antoninus Pius, eine Bestandsaufnahme seit G√©za Alf√∂ldys Konsulat und Senatorenstand\\" in Studia epigraphica in memoriam G√©za Alf√∂ldy, hg.

Life  An inscription from (modern Marino), currently in the Gallaria Lapidaria of the Vatican Museum, provides us details of his cursus honorum. Modestinus began his career as one of the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, one of the four boards that form the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. Mireille Corbier interprets the combination of this position and a lack of service as a military tribune as making him \\"predestined for an administrative career\\".Corbier, L'aerarium saturni et l'aerarium militare. Administration et prosopographie s√©natoriale (Rome: √âcole Fran√ßaise de Rome, 1974), p. 210 His next posting was as quaestor to the proconsular governor of Africa, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Modestinus was enrolled in the Senate. Two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed: plebeian tribune and praetor. Once he completed his term as praetor, Modestinus was qualified to hold several important offices. First was curator of the Via Salaria, which G√©za Alf√∂ldy estimates was from around the year 138 to around 141.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 295 This was followed by prefectus of the aerarium Saturni; although Alf√∂ldy dates his tenure from around the year 141 to 144,Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 293 Corbier has argued in her monograph on the prefects of the Roman treasuries that his tenure extended from the year 138 to 140.Corbier, 'L'aerarium saturni et l'aerarium, p. 211 While being prefect of this treasury in most cases led immediately to the consulate, Modestinus was instead governor of the public province of Achaea for the term 144/145.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 260 However, Corbier lists two other men who held a propraetorian governorship before acceding to the consulate. Modestinus also held a number of Roman priesthoods. These included membership in the collegium of the fetiales, in the sodales Augustales, and in the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis, the Roman priesthood entrusted with the care of the Sibylline oracles.

Description Kunzea serotina is a tree or shrub that has an erect growth pattern with fastigiate growing branches that form a pyramidal (pyramid-like) canopy. The growth pattern may vary under a stable environment in older trees. The shrub has a single trunk arising from the ground (base). Less commonly, it may have 2 to 3 trunks growing at the same time. The base is covered with a protective wall layer while the rest of the trunk is covered with the dead cambium tissue called the bark. The bark of K. serotina is a greyish-white to pinkish white colour. It has cracks which become bigger and crumpled as the bark grows older, forming a secondary layer of bark. The old bark is similar to the new bark, but has more cracks and crumples, with the upper surface of the older bark hanging loose and eventually peeling off. The plant has numerous branches which grow at or close to the base of the trunk. These are short and stout with a fastigiate branching with numerous leafy branchlets including a brachyblast within the branchlet and forming a curled apex. The vegetative buds are not clearly visible and hidden by the foliage. It has a diameter of 0.2-0.5mm covered with a bud scale, having a yellow-brown to red-brown colour forming an ovate shape. The midrib supports the upper half with a lengthy cuspidate tip, no lateral veins and oil gland and keel apex ciliate. The leaves and shoots are red- green, and pale-green spreads through the red or bright green colour of the leaves. The leaf and shoot lamina are (0.8-) 5.2 x 9‚Äì7.8) x (0.6-) 0.8 (-1.2) mm, with a narrow oval shape. The mature leaf has a dark glossy green or bronze green colour with the leaf margin and base red with a lamina of (2.0-) 3.7 (-6.3) x (0. 8- ) 1.1 (1.8) mm with a narrow oval shape with no hair and smooth surface. Flowering is from November to May, with peak flowering in January and February. The inflorescent compact and corymbiform with (1-3) 8 (-12) flowered with a length of 25mm long. Inflorescences on branchlets tips extend out with active vegetative growth without the male flower. Deciduous pherophylls with foliose form and about 0.9‚Äì25 mm in length, it has a round end and tapered to at the base. Hypanthium has a bell-shaped structure that is (1.6-) 2.0 (-3.4) x 1.9 (-3.5) mm and a free portion of 0.4 ‚Äì 0.8 mm long with a dark green or red-brown colour.

Distribution  = Natural global range = Kunzea is an Australasian genus that is endemic to Australia and New Zealand. Species of Kunzea are commonly found in North and South Island of New Zealand, in Western Australia and the great barrier islands of Australia. The Kunzea ericoides complex consists of 10 species that are endemic to New Zealand, seven of which were described for the first time by Peter James de Lange. Kunzea serotina is one of those seven, and is endemic to the North and South Island of New Zealand. It is a native tree or shrub that is not found anywhere in Australia but restricted to New Zealand. = New Zealand range = Kunzea serotina is a New Zealand native shrub or tree that is restricted to New Zealand North and South Island. It was first sited in Makaroro River, eastern Ruahine Range. In North Island it is found in Paeoa Range, Mt. Tarawera, Kaingaroa, Central Volcanic Plateau and the Northern Aorangi Range. North-east of Rangitaiki River K. serotina is abundant where it grows between flat and upland podocarp forest. In the South Island, it was first sited in Marlborough. It grows all throughout Canterbury from the north to the east Canterbury and down to Eastern Central Otago, growing along the ranges and remnants in the Canterbury plains. K.serotina is distributed throughout South Island,and in the North of Canterbury it is found east of upper Wairau, west of Karamea, and Wangapeka Valley and lakes around Nelson. The distribution spreads down to East Canterbury along the mountain ranges through upper Hurunui, mainly the Hanmer area and to Sumner. Crossing the Canterbury Plains further down south are remnants of K. serotina in Lake Wanaka and Hawea and Eastern Central Otago in Clutha Rivers and Nenthorn. = Habitat preferences = The Kunzea ericoides complex which includes Kunzea serotina is a tall shrub or tree species that is commonly found throughout New Zealand. The species grows particularly in areas that native forest once occupied but was removed and invades pasture lands. It easily establishes and becomes the dominant vegetation in the area. K. serotina grows mostly near inland mountain ranges; it prefers growing in seasonal frosting conditions. It is found growing on steep slopes on mountain ranges down to rivers and lakes, tussock grassland and above tree line on mountain tops. It is abundant on soil that has a lot of rock fragments and is easily affected by flooding. Life cycle/phenology The Kunzea eriocoides complex species flowers during early and late spring; the flowering of Kunzea serotina initiates in late spring (November) and peaks in mid-summer (January ‚Äì February) unlike other Kunzea species in the K. ericoides complex. The later flowering of the species is where the species name is derived from. The flowering of the K. serotina starts in November to May, flowering peaks in January and February and fruiting is from January to December. The seeds germinate and grow in different kind of soil conditions , with the seeds having a lifespan of up to five months in dry conditions. Germination of the seeds depends on the condition where the seed has been dispersed; if it is dispersed under a cover of moss the seed is slow to germinate, but it germinates rapidly if dispersed on bare soil without any cover. K. serotina is a fast growing trees or shrub, but is short lived, living up to 80 ‚Äì 150 years. The juvenile K. serotina takes approximately seven years (less than ten) to reach reproductive maturity, at which point the tree or shrub reaches a height of 1.5m. During its short lifespan the tree or shrub grows to a height of approximately 15m, increasing the trunk to about 60 cm in diameter. It produces a huge seedbank on the soil surface under the plant, where the seeds await dispersal through rainwater runoff, or germinate if the conditions are viable. The seeds of K. serotina are not adapted for long-distance dispersal, which depends on rainfall runoff to disperse the seed. Since the plant lacks the ability for long-distance dispersal it has adapted a character that enables it to survive up to five months or longer, if the seeds remain dry throughout the five months. Diet and foraging Kunzea serotina grows on soils that contain rock fragments and is barred close to the top soil. It also grows in areas where the soil is prone to flooding, steep slopes, and hard rock. K. serotina succeeds previous vegetation that once was growing in the area but was removed by natural disturbances. K. serotina colonizes more easily than the native forest or vegetation including pasture land that once dominated the landscape. Changes in the concentration of nitrogen in the will affect the growth performance of K. serotina; however, limited information is known about the species' soil nutrient requirements. The plant can tolerate dry soil conditions, twhichhat enables it to perform better than native forest. According to Olsen, it is found in areas where the soil is free-drained, with different soil types, from sand and loam to alluvium, sedimentary and ultra- mafic rock. Predators, parasites, and diseases The Kunzea serotina and other Kunzea spp. are not grazed by any livestock or browsing animal, but the flower provides a source of food (nectar) for the native bees, birds, gecko, flies, moths and beetles. Ochrocydus huttoni (kanuka longhorn) larvae is a pest that drills tunnels into the stem of the living K. serotina stem. Kunzea serotina is also regarded as a weed by farmers, as it can easily colonize pasture land. Other information Kunzea serotina was first recognized by W. Colenso in 1849 in Makaroro River and was also recognized by Allan in 1961 then later was first described in 2014. Before it was recognized and described it was known to the Maori people as ‚Äúmakahikatoa‚Äù meaning ‚Äúwhite-wood‚Äù. K. serotina is not a species that is threatened or at risk but abundant through New Zealand. Kunzea serotina has been used in restoration projects, such as Eyrewell Forest in North Canterbury because, as mentioned above in Predators, Parasites, and Diseases it is not eaten by grazing animals making it useful to spread further than fenced off restoration areas. This is by ways of germination and not being disturbed by grazing livestock.

Construction work on the bridge commenced in March 1877. The bridge consisted of both timber and iron with a Gothic appearance. Most noticeably, the tops of its piers were designed as turrets, giving the structure an ornamental appearance. The bridge was 1104 ft (336m) in length, with the roadway situated 20 ft (6m) above the high water mark. Construction of the bridge cost ¬£54,000. Officially opened on 1 January 1881, the Fitzroy Bridge was Rockhampton's first bridge and until the Alexandra Railway Bridge was opened in 1899, it was the only bridge crossing the river. Prior to it being built, residents were ferried across the river on a steam ferryboat. The official ceremony consisted of a procession walking across the bridge, the planting of memorial trees at the northern end and the bridge's designer, Frederick Byerley breaking a bottle of champagne on one of the pedestals at the southern end of the bridge where he \\"baptised\\" the structure, the Fitzroy Bridge. Following the official opening, a large crowd gathered at the Criterion Hotel who proceeding to drink a number of toasts in honour of Rockhampton's new bridge. Byerley was presented with a walnut writing desk along with a gold pen and pencil as a token of the respect the bridge workers had for him during construction of the bridge. The bridge remained in service until a new bridge, also called the Fitzroy Bridge, was officially opened alongside the old bridge on 27 September 1952. After standing for 75 years, the original Fitzroy Bridge was demolished on 25 January 1956. A commemorative plaque was erected on the riverbank near to where the bridge was once accessed from the south opposite the Criterion Hotel on 27 August 1988.

He murdered 5 of his newborn children that he had as a result of violations that his two stepdaughters were subjected to. For this reason he was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on April 6, 1900.  History  On May 29, 1896, a bag containing the arm of a baby was found at a waste facility. The findings were reported to Police Station 12, where the head of police ordered an inspection of the place. Leaving the place under surveillance, they found, among the trash, a shattered skull, legs, and the other arm. It was concluded that all parts were from the same body. The autopsy revealed that baby died from a skull fracture, but the investigation did not yield any leads as to who the victim or the killer was, leaving the crime unsolved. Two years later, on May 5, 1898, a body of a newborn with a shattered skull in advanced state of decomposition was found. On his arms and neck were signs of first and second degree burns. According to the forensic tests, the baby did not die from the burns, it died from severe compression of the anterior part of the neck. During the investigation, someone noticed that the body appeared to be wrapped up in burlap that is used often in repairs. It was established that a car had collected the garbage and human remains. Interviewing a man named Carretero, he confessed that he had seen the remains, but of fear of being considered involved, had decided to say nothing to police. Thoroughly reviewing the collected items, the researches noticed that the bag had numerous patches, had a remarkable wear on the trellises, as if it had been used by a peddler carrying baskets with straps and that in his pockets were remains of cigarettes and anise grains, which made the authorities consider that the perpetrator was either Spanish or Calabrian, since they had a habit of carrying anise seeds. The other garments, by their quality and condition, showed that their owner was poor. Thus, the police started staking out the garbage cart and directing the search towards people with scarce resources; they were able to locate and take cognizance on May 9, 1898, that on Artes Street 1438 (now Carlos Pellegrini) in the Retiro neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, there was a family that always dressed in the morning. The aforementioned family consisted of a woman named Rose Ponce de Nicola, her spouse, Cayetano Domingo Grossi (a carter by profession); Rosa's two older daughters Clara and Catalina, and three younger children. The police learned from neighbours' testimonies that Grossi had intimate relationships with his stepdaughters. It was also established that Clara had been pregnant a short time before, and a few days later, she was in a normal state, not knowing what happened to her baby. A day later, on May 10, a police commission ordered an inspection of a room occupied by the family, which revealed a tin containing the body of an infant wrapped in rags, thus confirming their suspicions. Grossi explained that the sack was found in a garbage bin belonging to his son Carlos, and that he had killed the baby at Clara's request. He also said that the other baby had been born dead. That night, Rosa and her daughter Clara declared that the latter had two children with Grossi. He initially denied having sex with his stepdaughters, blaming their boyfriends for their pregnancies. Finally, a few days later, he confessed to murdering the first found baby in 1896; at the same time he confessed to incinerating several more babies, but without assuming they had died. In subsequent interrogations, Grossi acknowledged having one child with Catalina and four with Clara, strangling three, the remaining two being burned by his stepdaughters. Rosa, Clara and Catalina accepted the five crimes but blamed Grossi for the deaths of the newborns. The strange degree of submission of the women to the criminal which had led them to be so silent for so long caught the police's attention. It was alleged that on one occasion Grossi tried to rape one of Rosa's younger daughters but the sisters prevented it. Finally, it was established that Grossi himself helped with the births and then threw the babies into fires, which was witnessed by the women.  Death sentence and execution  Grossi's concubine Rosa and her daughters, Clara and Catalina, were considered \\"concealers\\" of the homicides and were sentenced to 3 years of effective prison each and paying court costs. Ultimately, Catalina's sentence was reduced to 2 years in prison. Having established the responsibilities of the accused, Cayetano Domingo Grossi was found guilty as the perpetrator of the murders of the babies. He was sentenced to death by Judge Ernesto Madero. The day of his execution, at 5 o'clock in the morning Grossi's children entered the prison chapel, the first to enter being a 19-year-old man. He hadn't seen his father in over a year, but he showed no emotion on his face. The youngest son, Lorenzo, 6 years old, did not want to approach his father and shied away from his caresses. Teresita, his daughter, cried when she saw him, also resisted hugging him. First lientenants Rosa Burgos and Calisto Garc√≠a and captain Manuel Medrano were in charge of his execution. He was blindfolded, put on the bench and had his hands and feet tied. Grossi was executed by firing squad on April 6, 1900 at 8 AM. Second lieutenant Emilio Lascano approached his body and shot him in a coup de grace. He is the first serial killer in Argentinian history and not Cayetano Santos Godino, as most believe.

Country The Wambaya are an indigenous people of the southern side of the Barkly Tableland, whose lands are estimated by Tindale to have stretched over some . Their western frontier ran to Eva Downs, while to the east they inhabited the area as far as Mount Morgan. The southern limits were around Alroy Downs. They were present at Anthony Lagoon, Corella Lake, Brunette Downs, and Alexandria, and about the Brunette and Creswell Creeks. Working clockwise, their northern neighbours were the Ngarnka, with Waanyi on their eastern flank and the Wakaya, and then the Warumungu south with the Warlmanpa further west. Social organisation R. H. Mathews was the first to describe the class system governing marriage rules of the Wambaya, and used his model as a Wambaya pattern for an Australian intermarriage structure based on eight sectional divisions. In terms of identity, the way a language describes the landscape in which its speakers live defines their identity. In the case of the Wambaya people this means, as Harold Koch and Rachel Nordlinger state it, following an observation by Nicholas Evans that: > in creation myths it is very common for the ancestors to be described as > passing across the lands instilling different languages into different areas > as they go. People are then connected to a particular tract of land and, > through that connection, to the language associated with that place. Thus > the Wambaya people are Wambaya because they are linked to places which are > associated with the Wambaya language, and therefore speak Wambaya. The explorer David Lindsay remarked on the fine build of the Wambaya and other tableland peoples he encountered, with many as tall as 6 feet or over. Language The Wambaya language belongs to the Mirndi family of the non- Pama-Nyungan languages. Noting its unusual word ordering properties, Emily M. Bender described it as a \\"radically non-configurational language with a second position auxiliary/clitic cluster\\". She used it to illustrate the LinGO Grammar Matrix. History of contact The first colonial intruders into Wambaya lands were struck by the rich pasturing prospects they detected in the vast plains of Mitchell grass with their lagoons, streams and springs. Large herds of cattle were introduced to graze over the tableland, edging out the kangaroo, emus and bustards which had been the hunting staple of the original inhabitants. The Wambaya eventually adapted by taking on work in the cattle industry, though for a long time they were paid less than white stockmen. As late as the 1960s they received a pittance of $6 dollars a week, as opposed to the standard whiteman's weekly wage $46, for the same labour. With the passage of a ruling by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission establishing the principle of Equal pay for equal work in the outback, station owners reacted by dismissing their black employees, which meant many Wambaya established in the industry were fired and forced to drift away. The managers of the Brunette Downs Station endeavoured to bulldoze the last remaining trace of the Wambaya, an encampment they retained on the lagoon, and shift them 60 miles north to Corella Creek.

Early Life Enriqueta Gonz√°lez Baz was born in Mexico City on Calle de Correo Mayor on September 22, 1915. She attended Escuela n√∫mero 8 for women where she studied to become a teacher. After completing secondary school, her father, Roberto Gonz√°lez Baz, sent her to a two-year program at the Escuela Dom√©stica for domestic studies. Her father believed that above all, his daughters should be women: learn how to cook, tend the house, etc. At this school, one of her teachers, Elena Picazo de Murray, recognized Gonz√°lez Baz's talent for studying, so she urged her to pursue higher education. Education After finishing domestic school, Gonz√°lez Baz enrolled in night classes at the former San Ildefonso College while studying at the Escuela Nacional de Maestros in Mexico City where she earned a teaching credential to become a school teacher. She then enrolled in the National Preparatory School, where she studied physical sciences and mathematics. After graduating high school, she enrolled at the Faculty of Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. She was part of the first cohorts of students majoring in mathematics. In 1944, she became the first woman at National Autonomous University of Mexico and in Mexico to earn a degree in mathematics. She wrote a thesis on Special Functions (Bessel, Gama, and Legender) and completed postgraduate studies at Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Career and contributions During this time, the Ministry of Public Education in Mexico did not distinguish between the title of a mathematician and a mathematics teacher, so Gonz√°lez Baz became a high school math teacher. She taught mathematics at the National Preparatory School and various other secondary schools. She also taught mathematics at the Faculty of Sciences and was a researcher at the Institute of Physics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Among her mathematical works, she translated Solomon Lefschetz's 1930 textbook Topology. Legacy Gonz√°lez Baz was one of the five founding women of the Mexican Mathematical Society.

It has round or heart-shaped leaf and a reddish purple flower with a central white patch.  Description  Corybas diemenicus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single round or heart-shaped leaf long and wide. The leaf is green on the upper surface and silvery green on the lower side. There is usually only a single erect, dark reddish to purple flower with translucent areas, long and wide. The dorsal sepal is long and wide on a stalk about long and forms a hood over the labellum. The lateral sepals are about long, joined at their bases before tapering to a fine tip. The petals are wider than but shorter than the lateral sepals and joined to them. The labellum is long, wide and tube-shaped with a white centre and many short, broad teeth on the edges. Flowering occurs from June to December.  Taxonomy  The stately helmet orchid was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley and given the name Corysanthes diemenica. The description was published in Lindley's book The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants. In 1942 Herman Rupp and William Nicholls changed the name to Corybas diemenicus. The specific epithet (diemenicus) is a Latin word meaning \\"belonging to, or from Tasmania\\". (Tasmania was formerly known as Van Diemen's Land.) Distribution and habitat Corybas diemenus is widespread and common, growing in moist forest and rainforest, sometimes in drier habitats. It occurs in New South Wales south from Barrington Tops National Park through the Australian Capital Territory to the south-east of Victoria and Tasmania.

Located on the south side of the University of Oregon (UO) campus at 18th and University, it is the home field of the Oregon Ducks of the Pac-12 Conference. Robert C. \\"Bob\\" Sanders donated more than $16 million to build the stadium, a memorial to his late wife Jane Sanders, who had been a longtime fan of Ducks softball. Former Ducks softball coach Becky Sisley matched other donations, up to $200,000. The total cost of the stadium was $17.2 million. The stadium was opened in 2016 and expanded a year later with an additional 1,000 permanent general admission seats in the outfield. The official seating capacity is 2,500.  History  Jane Sanders (1928‚Äì2013) On June 7, 2014, US$10 million gift from alum and football player Robert Sanders supported a new stadium project to be named in honor of his wife, Olive Jane (Daggett) Sanders. They met at the University of Oregon, where she was a member of Pi Beta Phi, cheerleader for the Ducks, class of 1950, and he was a fullback on the football team, class of 1951. The Sanders were successful in the lumber industry with their business, RSG Forest Products Inc., on the west coast. Jane frequently attended Ducks softball games with her grandchildren; Bob wanted to honor her and support the Oregon Ducks. In May 2016, Bob Sanders donated an additional $6 million toward completion of the stadium. The total cost of construction was $17.2 million. = Howe Field = left Jane Sanders Stadium was constructed on the site of the University's Howe Field stadium, which was built in 1935 with a $10,000 grant from the Works Progress Administration. Howe Field is still the name of the field itself, according to the Daily Emerald. Named for Professor Herbert C. Howe of the English faculty, who served as faculty athletics representative, Howe Field had been used by the Ducks baseball team until Oregon dropped the men's baseball program in 1981. Describing the small field south of Mac Court as \\"a welcoming place for fans and hitters\\", former Duck shortstop Steve Wolf said it was \\"a kind of 'little Fenway'\\". However, it had no dugouts, no bathrooms, no clubhouse, and the grass was mowed by the players themselves. Memorial plaque dedicated to soldiers who died in World War I In 1974, Oregon had added the varsity women's softball program, which for four years used Amazon Park and a green space between Pioneer Cemetery and Gerlinger Hall as the softball home diamond. In 1978 a space south of Hayward Field was designated for the softball program. By 1987, the expanding Ducks track program needed more space, and the softball area at Hayward was converted to the hammer area. The softball program then moved to Howe Field, where dugouts were added, and temporary lights were brought in for telecast games. These improvements were funded by Bob Sanders, the alumnus who later also donated funding for the new Jane Sanders Stadium, according to the first softball coach at Oregon, Becky Sisley. Players used portable toilets, and changed in the locker room at the aging Mac Court. The Register Guard reported Howe Field had \\"no permanent bathrooms or on-site locker rooms, limited concessions, a small press box and little space for live television and radio broadcasts\\", and, \\"In recent years, Howe Field became a symbol of benign neglect.\\" The last remnants of Howe Field, the historic iron gates, are located in front of the new stadium's courtyard.  \\"The Jane\\"  Jane Sanders Stadium opened March 4, 2016, earning praise from ESPN, who compared it to similar ballparks in the Southeastern Conference. = Construction = The duck-wing canopy is lined with a mosaic of wood inlay home-plate shapes, with a nod to the lumber business of Bob and Jane Sanders. On April 30, 2015, the athletic department of the University revealed drawings of Jane Sanders Stadium, planned to replace facilities at Howe Field. Designed by SRG Partnership, the project was managed by Chris Hartson, and the university hired general contractor Howard S. Wright of Dallas to build the stadium. The new stadium was designed with features not formerly available at Howe Field, such as locker rooms and an indoor practice facility, as well as media rooms. The stadium was built to meet needs described by former coach Mike White, \\"...a player development center indoors, a place where we can have batting cages, and for recruiting, a place we can have a great team room\\". The upper level of the stadium includes concessions and restrooms, as well as a multi-purpose room, a video room, and offices for coaches. Jane Sanders Stadium opened March 24, 2016, with 1,500 permanent seats available. Temporary bleachers adding another 1,000 seats were constructed by April 1, 2016. = Addition of \\"The Bob\\" = Outfield bleacher seating nicknamed for donor Bob Sanders With a donation from Bob Sanders, in addition to his previous gifts of $16 million, construction on permanent outfield seating was announced in July 2017, and built in time for the 2018 season. The permanent seating also includes bathrooms and a concession stand. = Facilities = The stadium has a seated capacity of 1,483 people, including several suites and a grandstand that is covered by a V-shaped canopy decorated with wood cutouts in the shape of the home plate. The stadium's videoboard measures and cost $250,000. = Playing surface = The stadium has a clay infield and artificial turf in the outfield, as requested by former coach Mike White, making it playable in Pacific Northwest weather conditions.

History The Foundling hospital of Dublin was opened in 1704. Firmly established by mid-18th century, the Foundling Hospital had steadily become a large \\"baby finding\\" institution. Two primary objectives of the hospital were to avoid deaths and murders of illegitimate children and to teach the protestant faith to these children. No inquiry was made about the parents, and no money received. A cradle was installed by 1730.Wodsworth, p. 11. Between 1,500 and 2,000 children were received annually. A large income was derived from a duty on coal. In 1822 an admission fee of ¬£5 was charged on the parish from which the child came. This reduced the annual arrivals to about 500.Wodsworth, p. 52. Child deaths during transport to the hospital or whilst staying in the hospital was not infrequent and would often become subject to inquiry. The number of Protestant nurses was usually inadequate with the resulting use of Roman Catholic nurses and occasional consequence of \\"religious error\\". In 1829 the select committee on the Irish miscellaneous estimates recommended that no further assistance should be given. The hospital had not preserved life or educated the foundlings. The mortality was nearly 4 in 5, and the total cost ¬£10,000 a year. Accordingly, in 1835 Lord Glenelg (then Irish Secretary) closed the institution.

History Following a 1735 Act of the Irish Parliament which provided for hospitals being funded by a local tax on coal and culm, (a type of coal known as Anthracite), weigh-house fines, carriage car licenses and penalties on drivers of same, it was decided to establish a foundling hospital in Leitrim Street.Lewis, Samuel. A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland. S. Lewis & Co, 1837, 'Cork' Section. The properties constructed, at a site now occupied by the Lady's Well or Murphy's Brewery, were based around a small quadrangle with a chapel, school-rooms, boys dormitories, girls dormitories, and staff apartments. The hospital opened in 1747. In 1821 the foundling hospital was governed by the Lord Bishop of Cork, the Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen, Sheriffs, and Common Council, Common Speaker, and 26 others annually chosen at the Court of D'Oyer Hundred. At this time the tax on coal was levied at one Shilling per ton of coal imported into Cork. Geary, T. The Gentleman's & Citizen's Cork Almanack. Geary's, 1821, p.36.

He is linked to at least 70 murders (making him the third most prolific serial killer in Mexico). Although because of his motive he's not typically classified as a serial killer. His criminal association operated mainly in bars and restaurants around Mexico City, but were present in several states of the republic. It represented a great controversy regarding the double morality of society.  Modus operandi  Supposedly, according to detained members of the gang, David, along with his wife Claudia Castillos Maya, led the band. Las Goteras owes its name to the use of ophthalmological drops combined with intoxicating drinks as a poison to perpetrate their crimes. Their modus operandi was simple but effective: the women belonging to the gang approached the victims and took them to motels, where they were offered an intoxicating drink of high ethyl alcohol content (tequila or vodka) combined with ophthalmological drops that had benzodiazepine or cyclopentolate in the formula. These compounds combined with the ethyl alcohol act as suppressors of the nervous systems; those intoxicated with this mixture first feel dizzy and weak, followed by loss of consciousness, finally dying of cardio-respiratory failure. Many times the victims survived but had terrible aftermaths (from a terrible hangover, to blindness or anaphylactic shock). And for fear of the social opinion they did not reveal what had happened.  Arrest  On May 11, 2007, one of the most important cells in the gang was arrested in Mexico City; conformed by 18 people (11 men and 7 women). The detainees mentioned in their statements the existence of more cells and associated the band and referred to Avenda√±o as their leader. A year later, after several investigations, David Avenda√±o was arrested on February 12, 2008.  The double moral  The news of the existence of such gang shocked the public, and the victims were quickly demonized. More controversial was that the long list of deaths contained the name of the brother-in-law of a former governor of Chiapas.  New cases  At the beginning of 2009, the possibility of the band's continued action was supposed, despite the affirmations of the federal government that the band was completely extinct. On February 14, 2009, the corpses of two professional wrestlers were found inside a hotel in the Central district of Mexico City, the cause of death was defined as respiratory failure, traces of benzodiazepine were found in the bodies; a reason why it was immediately attributed to the Goteras. This event pointed to the possibility that the band as such is still functioning and Avenda√±o's arrest represented a political strategy to gain credibility with respect to the armed struggle that was and still is developing (it was never fought to Avenda√±o's innocence, but it was believed that he was just a simple member of the gang and not the leader), or simply a judicial mistake. In fact, this hypothesis represented a line of research to follow (it was possible that the gang was still in function, but it was a branch of descendant of the first one, according to the government). Although it was not ruled out the possibility were imitators, or simply isolated incidents. On July 21 and August 12, 2009, Mar√≠a de los √Ångeles S√°nchez Rueda and Estela Gonz√°lez Calva were arrested, the two sex workers who were responsible for the deaths of the two fighters. It was ruled out that they were members of \\"Las Goteras\\", it was determined that they were copycats. Both were sentenced to 47 years in prison.

It stands at high and is one of the tallest Buddha statues in Sri Lanka. The temple is built on land donated by the Minister of Lands, Hector Kobbekaduwa, to Ven. Ampitiye Dammarama Thero, a monk from the Amarapura Nikaya in the early 1970s. Initially Dammarama lived in a makeshift dwelling whilst soliciting funds for the construction of the temple. The temple was opposed by the senior monks of the Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic), claiming it would overshadow the centre of the Siyam Nikaya. In the 1980s a chief monk of the Amarapura Nikaya, Hinatiyana Dhammaloka, successfully petitioned President Ranasinghe Premadasa to intervene and legally grant the land to Dammarama. In the late 1980s Dammarama began to build a statue of Buddha, with construction of the statue completed in 1992. It was officially opened on 1 January 1993 by President Ranasinghe Premadasa.

History The company was co-founded by Asheesh Mehra and Govind Sandhu in 2015. Asheesh Mehra was formerly the Head of information of Infosys Technologies‚Äô BPO operations in the Asia Pacific, Japan and Middle East regions. Mehra had been involved with Infosys for seven years. They founded the new company to cater to the financial services and healthcare industries. It was initially headquartered in Singapore, with three delivery centers in India including an office in Mumbai. It initially had seed capital of $8 million. In June 2015, it was announced that the company was planning on acquiring two American firms. In October 2015, the company purchased Benchmark Systems, a company based in the United States. At the time, AntWorks primary delivery system was in Pune, India. Its first year, the company had $11 million in revenue. In March 2016, the company hired Greg Hackney to lead healthcare. In June 2016, the company announced it had upped its three-year revenue goal to $50 million and was scouting for acquisitions. The CEO attributed the increased goal as a result of the company's \\"transparent\\" pricing system. The 2018 research paper \\"Banking Automation & Roboadvisors: Cost Analyses, Impacts & Opportunities 2018 -2022\\" by Juniper Research identified Antworks as one of 5 robotic process automation vendors that are current market leaders in delivering advanced cognitive, or intelligent RPA solutions. As per the report, the other vendors include IP Soft, Pegasystems, Wipro and Workfusion. The study highlights IP Soft and Antworks as one of two vendors that provide AI-integrated RPA solutions that use both knowledge-based and pattern-recognition based AI to generate dynamic process execution. In July 2018, Japanese financial services giant SBI Holdings invested US$15 million (approx. INR 103 crore) in AntWorks. The investment in AntWorks was made through SBI Investment Co, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings. As part of the partnership, SBI Holdings and Singapore-headquartered AntWorks have also formed a joint venture to work in the AI space across Southeast Asia, according to a statement issued by Yoshitaka Kitao, president of SBI Holdings. In August 2018, HFS Research placed AntWorks' platform ANTstein in the Top Ten RPA Product 2018. Major Products AntWorks‚Äô primary product is ANTstein. It is an AI-based RPA software product designed to understand structured as well as semi-unstructured data types such as handwriting and forms, as well as broader cognitive capabilities that include pattern recognition, photos and images. It consists of Integrated technical and operational capabilities in a BOT which can be configured and trained. These bots can be created in a code- free environment, and allows automation of complex processes. ANTstein integrates cognitive Machine Learning and autonomous automation into a single technology stack. ANTstein is a content based, object retrieval framework with the capability to acquire and adapt to new information as part of its learning mechanism. It is designed to be able to handle business processes that require reasoning. With a cognitive machine reading based engine, ANTstein is designed to independently re-engineer itself while evaluating new data, and a dynamic learning engine allows it to analyse and resolve problems simultaneously. This product enables completion of laborious jobs of large teams, faster and with better accuracy.

She previously worked in the cargo ship industry. Lauritzen was born in 1971 in Denmark, to a Japanese mother and a Danish father. Her father had been a sailor for Maersk Line, but gave up that career when Lauritzen and his daughters were born. His stories inspired Lauritzen to pursue a maritime based career. She attended a navigation school in Fan√∏, Denmark.  Career  Lauritzen's first role on board a ship was while working for J. Lauritzen A/S in June 1989 as a junior seaman. She worked on the gas tanker Kosan for seven months. Afterwards, Lauritzen worked on ships in South America and on the Danish Great Belt ferries. After ten years in the industry, she had completed her Master Mariner certificate and was looking for a fresh challenge. She joined Royal Caribbean International as first officer on Grandeur of the Seas in November 1998. Laurtizen served in this capacity on several Royal Caribbean cruise ships, including Explorer of the Seas, Radiance of the Seas, Monarch of the Seas, and Jewel of the Seas. Her first command came as a Relief Captain on Jewel of the Seas in 2008, a position she also undertook on Radiance of the Seas. Lauritzen was named Captain of Vision of the Seas on 10 August 2011. This made her the second ever female Captain for Royal Caribbean International, after Karin Stahre-Janson who was named Captain of Monarch of the Seas in 2007. At the time of her promotion, Lauritzen was one of four female cruise ship captains then employed. She has since been made Captain for Jewel of the Seas. When not at sea, Lauritzen lives in Portugal.

Function microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].

As one of the most influential prelates following the Mongol invasion of Hungary, he held the office of royal chancellor for two decades, from 1240 until his death. Early career His origin is uncertain, but he was definitely born into a wealthy noble family, as one of his relatives was a certain comes Peter. In contemporary records, his name is referred to with the honorary title of \\"magister\\", demonstrating his education and skills in science. He first appears as vice-chancellor and provost of Buda in January 1238, holding both positions until 18 June 1240. His \\"friend\\", Bartholomew, Bishop of Veszpr√©m ceded certain tithe to the provostry of Buda. On 25 June 1240, he is already styled as royal chancellor. He functioned in this capacity for more than two decades until his death, the longest time of any office-holders during the Age of √Årp√°ds. Simultaneously, Benedict was elected provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r too, serving in this dignity until 1243. Shortly after the election, the chapter petitioned the case to the Holy See to request Benedict's confirmation from Pope Gregory IX, who appointed John of Civitella on 25 February 1241 to conduct the procedure. In his reply, the pope called Benedict as an \\"educated, diligent and honest man\\", finding him fit for the position. After the disastrous Battle of Mohi in April 1241, Benedict fled together with king B√©la IV and the royal court to the Dalmatian coast, and stayed there until the withdrawal of the Mongols from Hungary in 1242. Archbishop of Kalocsa Archbishop Ugrin Cs√°k was killed in the Battle of Mohi. Benedict was already styled as archbishop-elect in September 1241, when the royal court resided in Transdanubia yet. However, theologian J√≥zsef Udvardy considered that royal charter as a forgery. When the court arrived to Dalmatia by February 1242, Thomas the Archdeacon again referred to him as archbishop-elect. Udvardy argued Benedict's title meant a broad interpretation and merely B√©la's wish, as the cathedral chapter was unable to meet under the chaotic conditions and a royal document issued in August 1242 states that there was sede vacante in the episcopal see of Kalocsa. The canonical election of Benedict took place in the autumn of 1242, according to Udvardy. the newly elected Pope Innocent IV confirmed the episcopate of Benedict on 15 July 1243. The Archdiocese of Kalocsa suffered heavy damages due to the ravages of the Mongols, who left behind destroyed villages, depopulated regions, ruined churches and monasteries. As a result, Benedict decided to settle the friars of the Augustinian Order. In addition, Benedict intended to acquire lands and estates for his archbishopric; he bought the half of the village F√ºzegy, near to Szond in B√°cs County (Viziƒá and Sonta in Serbia, respectively) from local lord Gregory Monoszl√≥, who was forced to sell to the archdiocese because of its right of pre-emption in 1252. B√©la IV also donated a certain land of Pechul to Benedict, who also took care of the disabled child of Csama, the deceased landowner. Preparing for a new Mongol invasion, the Hungarian king abandoned the ancient royal prerogative to build and own castles, promoting the erection of new fortresses during his reign. The pope sent a letter to Benedict to entrust him and his suffragan bishops by defining places to build castles in the territory of the archdiocese. During several lawsuits regarding ecclesiastical estates, Benedict frequently acted as a mediator between the Holy See and the Hungarian royal court. When B√©la IV filed a complaint that Zlaudus J√°k was elected Bishop of Veszpr√©m without his consent in 1245, which \\"contradicted the old customary law\\". Innocent instructed Benedict of Kalocsa to investigate the case in February 1245. According to his letter, Stephen B√°ncsa, Archbishop of Esztergom confirmed Zlaudus' election despite the king's opposition. B√©la did not recognize the election and ignored Zlaudus in the royal council (his charters refer to the Diocese of Veszpr√©m \\"in vacancy\\"). The conflict has been resolved by December 1245. When Philip T√ºrje was elected Bishop of Zagreb in 1248, Benedict, as the metropolitan archbishop, confirmed the election, despite that one of the canons Albert challenged the legitimacy of the process. Thereafter Albert petitioned to the Holy See, but Pope Innocent confirmed Benedict's decision on 26 October 1248. Like his predecessors, Benedict also had to deal with the question of Bogomilism. In the summer of 1246, Benedict requested the Holy See to allow a crusade to be launched against the Bosnian Church. In response, Pope Innocent appointed him as a papal legate to Bosnia. As a response to the request of B√©la IV and Ponsa, Bishop of Bosnia, Pope Innocent IV decided to put the Bosnian Church under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Kalocsa in 1252. This decision provoked the schism of the Bosnian Christians, who refused to submit to the Hungarians and broke off their relations with Rome. Beside his function of royal chancellor, Benedict was also styled as \\"chief judge of the Jews\\" in 1251. He served as isp√°n and \\"royal governor\\" of Syrmia County in 1253 too, when ruled over a counterfeiting case. Archbishop of Esztergom The first royal castle of Esztergom became the archbishopric's property under Benedict's episcopate in 1256 Stephen B√°ncsa was created Cardinal Bishop of Praeneste (Palestrina) by Pope Innocent IV in December 1251, becoming the first Hungarian cardinal. B√°ncsa remained in the position of archbishop at least until 20 October 1252. Thereafter, he temporarily left Hungary for Rome. Even so, upon his personal request, he continued to serve as Administrator of the Archdiocese of Esztergom. However, he wanted to return to Hungary because of financial difficulties and climatic inconveniences. However, B√°ncsa's efforts in this direction failed. The Esztergom Chapter elected Benedict as their archbishop sometimes before May 1253. Benedict was submitted by B√©la IV himself to the position. The king requested the pope to confirm it in a letter dated May 1253. Later, he repeated his request in October. Simultaneously, Innocent granted B√°ncsa the privilege of returning to Esztergom, and continuing his administration of that diocese, until the next Feast of All Saints (November 1). At that point he was to resign the Church of Esztergom to a prelate of the Kingdom of Hungary of his choice, and return to the Papal Curia by Christmas 1253. If he did not return by that date, the bishopric of Palestrina was to be considered vacant, according to the pope's instruction. B√°ncsa did not achieve his purpose, as the legitimacy of his administration was not recognized in Hungary; finally, the election of Benedict was confirmed by Pope Innocent on 25 February 1254. Benedict was advised, however, that during his episcopate, he should not give away pensions or prebends without the express permission of the Holy See. As compensation, Stephen B√°ncsa was granted annual 300 silver denari from the archdiocese's income. Thus B√°ncsa was forced to return to Rome. Benedict had to borrow 3500 silver denari during his translation from Kalocsa to Esztergom. On 11 March 1254, Pope Innocent sent his pallium through his procurators, provost Peter and vicar Reynold. Benedict was present, when Pope Innocent IV mediated a peace treaty between B√©la IV and Ottokar II of Bohemia, which was signed in Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) on 1 May 1254. He was granted the vineyard of Vadkert (today √ârsekvadkert, lit. \\"Archbishop's Wild Garden\\") and the right of collection of tithe beyond the Drava river by B√©la in 1255. Benedict had several conflicts with the local burghers, who were allowed to live in Esztergom Castle. As a result, B√©la IV resettled them to their old homes, and the archdiocese was granted the royal palace and the surrounding ancient castrum on 17 December 1256 (the phrase \\"Holy Crown\\" first appears in this donation letter). Simultaneously, the king ordered the construction of reinforced stone walls around the town of Buda and set his own royal palace on the top of the protecting hills of Buda, creating a new royal capital in the decades between 1247 and 1265. Benedict held a national synod in Esztergom in the same year (1256), where several bishops and, among others, Blessed Eusebius, the First Provincial of the Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit (first mentioned in this capacity) attended, but its resolutions did not survive. Pope Alexander IV donated the privilege of annual 40-day indulgence to the visitors of the St. Adalbert Cathedral of Esztergom on the occasion of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul in 1257. Benedict died in the second half of 1261, last mentioned by contemporary records in July.

Unlike his predecessors who mainly dealt with polemics and theology, most of his written works deal with Kavya (poetry), Alankara (figure of speech) and Nataka (drama), which is considered unique in history of Dvaita literature. He is also notable as a disciple of Vijayendra Tirtha, engaging in scholarly debates across the subcontinent and for mentoring Raghavendra Tirtha who succeeded him as the pontiff of the matha at Kumbakonam. Regarding his oeuvre in the context of Dvaita literature, Sharma notes \\"he was left us works of real merit, which stand out like oases in the dreary desert of theological writings\\". His works are characterised by alliterations, elegance and simplicity. Life Information about his life mainly comes from Raghavendra Vijaya by Narayanacharya. Nothing is known about his early life. He served as a disciple of Vijayendra Tirtha whom he later succeeded as the pontiff of the matha at Kumbakonam in 1596. The text speaks of Sudhindra receiving patronage by the rulers Venkatapati Raya of Vijayanagara and Raghunatha Nayaka of Tanjavur indicating his influence and respectability as a holy man. There are records of him inducting Goud Saraswat Brahmin families of Cochin to the precepts of Dvaita and installing an idol of Venkateswara for their utility, implying his popularity among the people of that particular sect. Raghavendra Vijaya speaks of Sudhindra mentoring and grooming the young Venkatanatha (known later as Raghavendra Tirtha) to take up the mantle of sannyasa and succeed him as the pontiff. Sudhindra died in 1623 and his mortal remains are enshrined in Navabrindavana in Hampi. Works Among his non-extant works is a commentary on Vyasatirtha's Tarkatandava called Sadyuktiratnakara, a commentary on Bhagavata Purana and a work on aesthetics entitled Madhudhara. Alamkara Manjari is a manual of figures of speech and metaphors. In the context of Indian poetics, alamkara can be translated to \\"literary ornamentation\\". Sudhindra demonstrates the aspects of alamkara by making his guru, Vijayendra, the subject of ornamentation and praise. His Alamkara Nikasa is a work of similar nature of enumerating and expanding upon different alamkaras. Views of different philosophers on the elements of Indian aesthetics such as rasa and kavya are consolidated and expanded upon. Sahitya Samrajya is a commentary on the original by Krsna Yajvan, who was a philosopher of poetics in the Tanjore court. The work is unique in the history of Dvaita literature in that, Sharma notes, \\"a Madhva ascetic and pontiff of Sudhindra's standing, should have come forward to comment on the work of a layman and a Smartha, laying aside all considerations of pontifical prestige and religious difference\\". Damaged fragments of a drama entitled Subhadra Dhananjya has been ascribed to him.

They were traditionally used as houseboats by the seagoing Sama Dilaut. Since most Sama have abandoned exclusive sea-living, modern lepa are instead used as fishing boats and cargo vessels. Lepa are medium-sized boats, usually averaging at in length, and around in width; with the hull averaging at in height. Lepa is also known as pidlas, among land-dwelling Sama. Very large lepa are known as kumpit. They can reach lengths of and are most often used as trade ships. Family lepa usually tow smaller daughter ships, like the buggoh or the birau. Lepa can also be used as a generic term for \\"boat\\" in the various Sama-Bajau groups; the vinta, for example, is also known as lepa-lepa. Lepa nowadays are increasingly being replaced by motor-powered outrigger canoes, the pambot (\\"pump boat\\"). National Museum of Ethnology, Osaka, Japan Description Sketch of a lipa-lipa (lepa-lepa) of Bajau people. The keel of lepa is made from a shallow dugout known as the tadas or lunas. It is built up along the sides with strakes that are narrower than the keel. An additional three sideboards are joined edge-to-edge to the topmost strake (the gunwales), extending from the stern. They are known as (bottom to top) bengkol, kapi kapi, and koyang koyang. They do not extend fully towards the prow, forming a distinctive gap at the front hull of the ship. The hull tapers sharply at the prow and stern. Like in other indigenous Philippine ships, the hull of the lepa is traditionally fitted together by dowels (tambuko) and fiber lashings instead of nails. A detachable house-like structure (the kubu or balutu) is often built in the center of the hull, with a removable decking known as lantai as the floor. The roof (sapaw) is made with plaited nipa leaves mounted on detachable Y-shaped posts. The portable cooking hearth (lappohan) is located in the stern deck, along with stored food (lutu) and water jars (kibut). Lepa has a single sail (lamak), mounted on a mast socketed into the keel through the front decking. Like the roof posts, it can be detached as needed. Lepa can also be propelled by paddles (dayung) or quant poles. Modern lepa are almost universally fitted with motor engines. Lepa can be differentiated from other native boats in the region (like the djenging and vinta, which are also used as houseboats) in that the lepa does not have outriggers. The prow and the stern are also made from flat carved blocks of wood, and not posts or curving planks as in vessels like the balangay. The bow (mundaÀä) and the stern (buliÀä) are low on the water to make the casting and gathering nets easier, as well as facilitate poling and rowing. A lepa in the 2015 Regatta Lepa festival in Semporna, Malaysia Lepa are traditionally decorated with elaborate flowery designs known as okil (also spelled ukkil). The prow, especially, often features a large beautifully-carved bowsprit called the jungal or jungar. Traditions In the Philippines and Malaysia, there are usually no rituals involved in the making or the launching of the lepa, probably a result of the higher level of Islamization of indigenous Sama beliefs. In eastern Indonesia however, prayers and rituals are associated with the joining of the keel with the bow and stern blocks, and the drilling of the mast post (the \\"navel\\" of the ship). After the latter, the boat is launched for the first time, and symbolically becomes the child of the boat owner. In the nomadic past of the Sama Dilaut, before a young man was to be married, his family would build or buy him a lepa, so he and his wife could live as an independent fishing unit. Upon his death, his lepa would be disassembled and served as his coffin for burial. Before undertaking long or dangerous journeys, lepa are often blessed with magic spells (haligmun) by the village shaman. These include spells that supposedly makes them invisible to pirates or deflect bullets. Sama-Bajau also sometimes make a pledge (magjanji') to God (Tuhan) or to ancestor spirits (umboh) in a crisis at sea, or when a boat fails to return home. When the boat is safe, the pledge is paid by a thanksgiving feast called the magmaulud or magbajanji. Regatta Lepa Regatta Lepa is an annual boat festival in Semporna, Malaysia, celebrating the boat-building tradition of the Sama-Bajau communities in Sabah.

History On his retirement from the Bank of England in 1908, Grahame returned to Blewbury in Berkshire, the county in which he had grown up. In October that year he published The Wind in the Willows, a novel for children featuring an array of anthropomorphic characters, including Rat (a water vole), Mole, Badger and Toad. Toad lives in a house on the edge of the River Bank, Toad Hall. The novel was almost universally condemned by critics, but achieved very considerable sales. It has been in print continuously since its publication and has been adapted for plays, a ballet, films and musicals. Originally published as plain text, it has subsequently been illustrated by a number of notable artists including Paul Bransom, Arthur Rackham and E. H. Shepard. Description Grahame's description of Toad Hall is sparse: \\"a handsome, dignified old house of mellowed red brick, with well-kept lawns reaching down to the water's edge\\". Its owner is in no doubt as to its merits: Finest house on the whole river,' cried Toad boisterously. 'Or anywhere else, for that matter. The hall has a \\"very old banqueting-hall\\" and a \\"large boat-house\\". Stables stand to the right of the house, as viewed from the river. An ancient passage, unknown to Toad but vouchsafed to Mr Badger by Toad's father, and of critical importance to the novel's denouement, \\"leads from the river bank ..., right up into the middle of Toad Hall\\". Inspirations A number of houses have been cited as the inspiration for Toad Hall. These include: * Fawley Court in Buckinghamshire; * Fowey Hall Hotel in Cornwall; * Foxwarren Park in Surrey; * Hardwick House in Oxfordshire; * Mapledurham House also in Oxfordshire.

As with most regional recipes, there are as many recipes as there are people making it, everyone adding their own personal touch. Description This dish consists of one or two big meatballs (the size of the ball allows one to differentiate a boulet from the smaller boulette), made from pork and veal or pork and beef minced meat, bread crumbs, onions and parsley. The balls are then cooked in a pan until golden brown before lowering the heat and letting the meat simmer in a sweet and sour sauce made from onions, vinegar, brown sugar, Li√®ge syrup and Corinthian raisins. The sauce is called sauce lapin (literally \\"rabbit sauce\\"), not because of any rabbit in the sauce but after Madame G√©raldine Lapin, born Corthouts, wife of Ernest Lapin (1868-1922), a tax collector in the suburbs of Li√®ge. A true institution in brasseries and friteries throughout Li√®ge, and known nationwide, this dish is traditionally served with French fries (it is then called boulets-frites), mayonnaise, and lightly seasoned crudit√©s or apple sauce.

It is related to the larger eruption of Kƒ´lauea that began on January 3, 1983, though some volcanologists and USGS scientists have discussed whether to classify it as a new eruption. Outbreaks of lava fountains up to high, lava flows, and volcanic gas in the Leilani Estates subdivision were preceded by earthquakes and ground deformation that created cracks in the roads. On May 4, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake hit Puna. By May 27, 2018, 24 fissures had erupted lava in and near the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions. The eruption forced the evacuation of approximately two thousand residents. The Puna Geothermal Venture, which provided one-quarter of the island's electricity, was forced to shut down and was later damaged by lava. The fissures had sent lava rivers that buried part of Hawaii Route 137 on May 19, and began flowing into the ocean. On May 29, lava from a new northeastern flow overran Hawaii Route 132, cutting the access between Kapoho and PƒÅhoa. The massive lava flow reached the Pacific Ocean at Kapoho Bay on June 4. Lava entered the Kapoho Crater and evaporated Green Lake, the largest natural freshwater lake in Hawai'i. On the night of June 4‚Äì5, the northeastern flow of lava speedily moved forward and destroyed the subdivision of Vacationland Hawaii. By June 5, Kapoho Bay had been filled in with lava now forming a point where the bay had been. The volcanic activity was the most destructive in the United States since the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. By August 7, of land had been covered by lava flows. About of new land has been created in the ocean. The official number of houses destroyed by the eruption reached 700 on July 9. It was estimated that recovery efforts would cost more than $800 million (2018 USD). By early August the eruption had almost completely subsided, and on December 5, it was declared to have ended after three months of inactivity. Background The volcanic event in Puna was the 62nd episode of Kƒ´lauea's east rift zone eruption that began in January 1983. Pu ªu  ª≈å ª≈ç had become a prominent volcanic cone east of the summit caldera of Kƒ´lauea, since the 1983 eruption's beginning. In the 1980s and 1990s, Pu ªu  ª≈å ª≈ç produced lava flows that destroyed the nearby Royal Gardens subdivision and the settlement of Kapa ªahu. In 1990, lava flows from the K≈´pa ªianahƒÅ vent of Kƒ´lauea, downrift from Pu ªu  ª≈å ª≈ç, destroyed and partly buried most of the nearby towns of Kalapana and Kaim≈´. On April 30, 2018, the crater floor of the cone of Pu ªu  ª≈å ª≈ç collapsed and the summit lava lake level in Halema ªuma ªu dropped significantly. In the first two days of May, hundreds of small earthquakes were detected on Kƒ´lauea's East rift zone, leading officials to issue evacuation warnings for some residents of the Puna District. On May 2, 2018, the US Geological Survey reported that ground deformation resulting from magma intruding beneath the Leilani Estates subdivision had caused ground cracks to form on roads in and around the subdivision. In connection with the eruption and its possible effects on the Hilina Slump, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory published information concluding that the chance of a catastrophic collapse would be incredibly remote. Eruption =Earthquakes and Leilani Estates fissures= On May 3, 2018, after a 5.0 earthquake earlier in the day, steaming ground cracks opened in Leilani Estates and began to spew lava, causing evacuations of the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions. The outbreak marked the beginning of the 62nd episode of the east rift zone eruption that began in January 1983. That evening, Hawaii Governor David Ige activated the state National Guard to help with the evacuation process. The next day, May 4, two homes were reported destroyed in Leilani Estates from three erupting vents. The Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency reported high levels of toxic sulfur dioxide gas in the area, and Talmadge Magno, the Civil Defense Administrator for Hawai ªi County, stated that power lines had melted off poles from the heat. The Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV), a power station, was shut down on 22 May 2018; the geothermal power plant provided approximately 25% of the Big Island's power, but its shutdown was later stated not to present a risk to power on the island. A Temporary Flight Restriction area was declared by the FAA to restrict flights below 3,000 feet AGL in the eruption area. A 6.9 magnitude earthquake occurred on May 4 that the United States Geological Survey said was related to the eruptions.The \\"lurch\\" from this quake was from pressure on the east rift zone from the magma intrusion., ; Tectonic Summary: [...] This earthquake was directly associated with activity at Kilauea, and the evolution of its rift system. [...], The earthquake was the strongest to hit the state since 1975. On May 6, Hawai ªi County Civil Defense reported that 26 houses had been destroyed by lava or fires in Leilani Estates. Lava fountains up to were observed in the subdivision. The lava vents formed a northeast/southwest line; officials were concerned about potential damage to a water main in the area. On May 7, 1,700 people had been ordered to evacuate their homes. Two hundred residents and their pets were in two Red Cross shelters and hundreds more were staying with family and friends. Several first responders were sickened by sulfur dioxide gas. Also on May 7, the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated, for humanitarian use of satellite data. (The USGS used Sentinel2 and Arirang-2.) By May 9, another home had been destroyed, along with other structures. The fifteenth fissure opened near the entrance to Lanipuna Gardens and added more lava to the nearly covered since May 3.

A 17th fissure opened east of the 16th fissure later that day. As of May 14, 2018, lava flows from fissure 17 had traveled just under a mile from the vent, destroying an additional structure and leading officials to advise residents in an area known as Four Corners to evacuate due to the possibility that lava from a future fissure could cut Highway 132 and eventually Highway 137 as well. A spokeswoman for the mayor also reported that the chemistry of the lava was changing in later fissures, containing a mixture of more viscous old lava and faster-moving new magma. By May 16, there were 20 fissures. That day the ash plume from the summit reached 12,000 feet. On May 17, an eruption from the summit sent an ash cloud 30,000 feet high. A 21st fissure opened and several magnitude 3 earthquakes damaged the road near the entrance to Hawai ªi Volcanoes National Park and some of the park buildings. On May 17, at approximately 4:15 a.m., an explosive eruption occurred at Halema ªuma ªu, creating a plume of ash 30,000 feet into the air. On May 19 some of the fissures had merged into a line of fountaining lava, with a lava flow split into separate lobes. At least two of the lava flows through parts of Malama Kƒ´ Forest Reserve crossed Highway 137 and flowed into the Pacific Ocean at Malama flats near MacKenzie State Recreation Area on May 19, producing clouds of irritating ‚Äúlaze‚Äù (lava haze), made up of steam, hydrochloric acid, and volcanic glass particles produced by littoral explosions. Warnings regarding the hazard were issued for communities downwind of the lava‚Äôs ocean entry points. By May 22, splashes from fissure 22's lava cone had engulfed the former Hawai ªi Geothermal Project site adjacent to the PGV and was reported to be threatening the grounds of the PGV proper from the south until activity at fissure 22 slowed.

On the same day, fissures 5, 13, and 15 began to form lava fountains around the Leilani Avenue-Kahukai Street intersection. Fissures 3, 7, 8, 9, 21 and 23 farther up the rift zone would experience intermittent but lively activity between May 24 to May 27 as the center of activity moved to fissure 7. A 24th fissure would also form farther up the fissure complex on May 27, between fissures 8 and 9. Due to continued encroachment by lava, the number of destroyed structures was revised upward to 82 on May 25. The area of land covered by the 2018 lava on May 25, 2018 reached 2,223 acres. The eastern fissures would experience limited resurgences in activity into June and July. The pool of lava in Leilani Estates eventually spilled eastwards into two paths, one short-lived route running southeast parallel to lava channels headed for the ocean, and another travelling northeast, crossing Pohoiki Road over the western boundaries of the Puna Geothermal Venture. On May 27, one of the 11 geothermal wells at the PGV was covered by the advancing lava flow from the Leilani Estates fissures, the first time lava had covered a geothermal well, followed by a second well hours later, along with ten more structures in the adjacent Leilani Estates. As the lava flow from Leilani Estates intensified by the end of May, activity shifted to fissure 8 as nearly all surrounding fissures ceased to release lava. Fissure 8's lava fountains rapidly formed a new cinder cone, increasing the volume of pooling lava over the course of the week and feeding the northeastern flow further. By May 29, the northeastern flow approached Hawaii Route 132, which linked PƒÅhoa and Kapoho, blocking the access road to the PGV and forcing the closure of Route 132 between the Lava Tree State Park from the west and the Four Corners intersection to the east. The lava flow covered a section of the highway later that day, before travelling farther east in the direction of Kapoho. The northeastern lava flow also cut power to Kapoho and nearby developments including Vacationland Hawai ªi, and surviving sections of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens. It was not known how and when power to those communities could be restored. By the morning of June 3, the lava flow from fissure 8 had reached Kapoho and Vacationland Hawai ªi, where it then destroyed hundreds of houses as it buried most of the town within a day. Lava also entered the Pu ªu Kapoho crater and evaporated the 400-year old Green Lake inside the crater, the largest natural freshwater lake in Hawai'i. The flow entered the ocean at Kapoho Bay at about 10:30 PM HST that evening, creating plumes of laze, and began to fill the bay, building a lava delta that reached about 700 yards into the water by late afternoon on June 4. By June 5, the lava had completely filled the bay, and preliminary reports from Hawai'i County officials indicated that hundreds of homes had been destroyed. In addition to the draining of Pu ªu  ª≈å ª≈ç, the protracted release of lava along the Lower East Rift Zone has also led to significant drainage of lava away from Halema ªuma ªu at Kƒ´lauea, resulting in large scale inward slumping and collapse around the crater and regular earthquakes since May 17, similar in pattern to the crater's slumping during the 1924 event. Explosions or mild earthquakes of similar magnitude became an almost daily cyclical occurrence at the summit, and have also been reported to influence the intensity of lava surges at fissure 8.US Geological Survey,\\"Frequently Asked Questions about Kilauea Volcano's summit earthquakes\\" =Transition to steady lava effusion, and August 2018 pause= By the middle of June 2018, lava eruption from the source in Leilani Estates reached a consistently vigorous rate, flowing in the direction of Kapoho Bay and forming a widening coastal lava field. By July 3, fissure 8's constant lava splatter created a cone that peaked at high. A total of 5,914 acres were reported by Hawaii Civil Defense to have been covered by lava, with 533 homes confirmed destroyed. On June 22, the number of houses covered by lava was revised upwards by Hawaii County Civil Defense to 614. By July 1, that total had grown to 671 residences destroyed. The official toll of houses reached 700 on July 9, leaving 3 houses left standing in Kapoho. On July 13, geologists reported a tiny new island had appeared immediately offshore from the lava flow. The island was only across and may have formed as a submarine tumulus pushed up the outermost crust of the earth above sea level. It was connected to the mainland by an isthmus on July 16. In mid-July, the main stream of lava from fissure 8 changed course away from flowing around the northeast of Pu ªu Kapoho crater following a breakout from a lava pond on July 9, redirecting to a new channel that traveled in a more direct southerly direction west of Pu ªu Kapoho. The flow would cover more of the 1955 lava flow, and destroy more coastal features including Ahalanui Beach Park, its warm ponds, as well as Kua O Ka LƒÅ Public Charter School's Lower Puna compound on July 11. By July 24, 2018, the western boundaries of the lava spill was within of Isaac Hale Beach Park. As of July 21, 2018, the lava flow from fissure 8 was estimated to be a steady , according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which also stated that the most likely scenario was that lava effusion would continue at a steady rate for several months to two years. By mid-July 2018, the volume of lava had exceeded the volume deposited in the eruptions of 1955 or 1960. Eruption activity at fissure 8 began to see a downtrend beginning on August 5, 2018, as the intensity of both the lava channel and seismic activity at Halema ªuma ªu decreased significantly over the course of the following days. Within the same time frame, the USGS reported that Pu ªu  ª≈å ª≈ç was venting gases at its highest rate in more than 10 years, though no other noticeable changes had taken place at the vent. On August 15, 2018, the lower east rift zone eruption was reported to have subsided, with no new lava entering the channel from fissure 8 in over a week. While scientists cautioned that the eruption could resume at any time, in that week there was no further underground volcanic inflation registering on instruments, and no further summit collapse events, with only a small amount of lava active inside fissure 8.  Impact and response  The Hawaii National Guard stated on May 11, 2018, that they were ready to evacuate up to 2,000 people at a moment's notice, through the use of land convoys and Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters. Hawaii Governor David Ige had made a request for a Presidential Disaster Declaration, which was approved that day and opened the door to federal assistance for the disaster. Starting May 23, two CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters were on standby in Hilo in case of sudden evacuation needs. The U.S. Marine Corps helicopters were in support of Joint Task Force 5-0, a military/government partnership to assist in managing the disaster. The large heavy-lift helicopters have a carrying capacity of about 50 people at once, ensuring that residents south of the lava flow can be completely evacuated in a few hours, should the last functioning road out of the area south of the lava flow be cut off by the eruption. As the area of destruction grew significantly as a result of fissure 8's resurgence in late-May 2018, access to surviving sections of Leilani Estate within immediate proximity to the margins of the lava field began to be heavily restricted starting May 31. A proposed ban on future home construction in areas subject to high-risk of volcanic activity was also reported on July 1, 2018 to be in discussion by Hawaii politicians. Temporary repair works were conducted for sections of Highway 11 (near Volcano Village and the entrance to Volcanoes National Park) and Highway 130 (connecting much of lower Puna to the rest of the island), which suffered cracks from seismic activities over the months, and have been subject to restricted use due to the extent of their damage. Chain of Craters Road, which has previously been partially covered by past lava flows, had also been prepared as an alternate escape route should Highway 130 be blocked by the current eruption, a measure previously taken during the 2014 PƒÅhoa lava flow. In early June, a Winter Weather Advisory alert was issued for the higher areas of the island due to freezing rain and ice falling. The quantity of lava reaching the ocean created large plumes of steam which rose high enough in the atmosphere to eventually condense and freeze before falling on the summit of Mauna Kea, from the eruption. Sporadic incidences of injuries and emergency rescues have been reported over the course of the eruption. The first known injury was reported on May 20, 2018: A homeowner was struck with a piece of \\"lava spatter\\" and suffered burns and a broken leg. Four people were evacuated by helicopter on May 19, after lava cut off their exit, and three people were airlifted on June 3 from the Kapoho area. On July 16, a further 23 were injured when a tour boat carrying passengers observing a lava ocean entry was pelted by lava rocks thrown by an intense hydrovolcanic explosion, including a large lava rock that pierced through the boat's roof. Thirteen were treated at the hospital, including three who were admitted with unspecified injuries and one in serious condition with a broken thigh bone.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. History Thomas W. Taliaferro was born in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1863. His family moved to Chicago in the 1870s, and Taliaferro started working in the meat-packing industry as a clerk in about 1880. He was soon a bookkeeper and then cashier of the packinghouse Underwood & Co., and by 1885 he was plant superintendent. In 1886, Taliaferro married Margaret Forbes McKay, a native of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. The couple soon moved to Omaha, Nebraska, and by 1897 Taliaferro was the general manager of Omaha Packing. By 1908, Taliaferro has moved the Detroit to become the vice-president of the meat-packing firm of Hammond, Standish & Co. He became president of the firm in 1922. By the 1920s, Bloomfield Hills was becoming suburbanized, with Judson Bradway developing first the Bloomfield Highlands subdivision in 1914, then the Bloomfield Estates and Bloomfield Manor subdivision, and then the Trowbridge Farms subdivision in 1917. Trowbridge Farms lots required that the house, exclusive of outbuildings or lot improvements, cost at least $10,000, and that no building could be set closer than twenty-five feet from a lot line. Thomas W. and Margaret Taliaferro had lived in Birmingham, Michigan since 1912, and in 1925 they purchased a lot and built this house, one of the first two houses built in the subdivision. The Taliaferros lived in this house until Margaret's death in 1939 and Thomas's in 1940. In 1941, the house was occupied by the Children's Fund of Michigan, in 1944 by John Singos and Marian Singos, in 1956 by Charles O. Miller, in 1968 by Herbert and Mary Jane Craw, and in 1974 by Conleyt and Nancy Bacon, who owned the house until at least 2011. Description The Taliaferro house a two and-a-half-story T-shaped building of mixed Tudor Revival, Arts and Crafts design. It stands on a low, wooded hilltop. The house is asymmetrical, with a combination of gable and hip roofs. The exterior is clad in stucco with red brick and limestone trim and wood shingles on the dormers. A cross-gable-roof three-bay garage is sited near the house and connected by a gable-roof porte cochere. The central entrance door projects outward and is enframed with cut stone jambs and a brick arch overhead. A leaded glass panel is within the arch, and casement windows with stone surrounds flank the entrance. Above the door is a broad triple leaded glass window, and in the gable peak above is a decorative arched window. Next to the gabled entry section is a hip-roof portion of the house's front containing a paired casement leaded glass window with cut stone jambs on the first floor, and double-hung windows on the second. A shed dormer projects from the roof above. On the other side of the entrance is another paired leaded glass casement window, along with a pair of leaded glass French doors, above which is a double-hung window.

The maps are gathered in nine volumes and show how the Low Countries, including Belgium and the former colonies of the Netherlands, have developed over the course of about two decades. The atlas contains more than 600 printed and manuscript maps and is preserved by the Special Collections of the University of Amsterdam.Atlas der Neederlanden in the Catalogue Library of the University of Amsterdam. Composite atlas Frontispiece from the publishing company Covens and Mortier. The Atlas der Neederlanden is an atlas factice, also known as composite atlas. These atlases were composed by wealthy people who collected maps concerning a specific region or topic. In some cases rich buyers contracted the publisher to collect the maps for them. These maps were then bound together in one or more volumes by a book binder in the typical ‚Äúatlas-binding‚Äù. Each composite atlas contains a different collection of maps and is therefore unique in its composition. There are different composite atlases preserved, for example the Atlas Blaeu- Van der Hem in the Austrian National Library in Vienna and the Atlas Van der Hagen, which was made earlier than the Atlas der Neederlanden, around 1690, and has been in the possession of the National Library of the Netherlands since 1887. History Map of the northern part of Overijssel (1743). Who the collector of the Atlas der Neederlanden was or for whom it was made remains unclear. At some point in the 19th century the book found its way to the University of Amsterdam where it is now part of the Special Collections of its University Library. It is assumed that the atlas was composed by Covens and Mortier. The publisher is mentioned at the frontispieces of eight of the nine volumes with the following text: Table des cartes etc: de I. C√≥vens et C. Mortier contenues dans ce volume. Also, most of the maps in the atlas were published by Covens and Mortier. When the last volume of the atlas was finished around 1816, the publishing house was led by Cornelis Covens (1764-1825). He worked for his family‚Äôs firm from 1790 until 1825, bringing it innovation and success. Covens and Mortier published many new maps but also kept the old stock, which ensured that the firm had a large fund of maps. Within the field of commercial and government cartography Covens and Mortier became the leading publishing company at the beginning of the 19th century.Marco van Egmond, Covens & Mortier: a map publishing house in Amsterdam, 1685-1866 (Houten 2009). Around 1816 the last volume of the atlas was finished. The largest part of the map collection dates from the 18th century. A few maps originate from the 17th century, like the Leo Belgicus dating from 1611 and a map of the Netherlands created by Frederik de Wit in 1670. Most of the 18th century maps are collected in volumes 1-8. Volume 9 contains maps from the 17th century and a few maps dating from the beginning of the 19th century. This volume doesn‚Äôt have a frontispiece of the publisher. The most recent maps in the atlas are to be found in volume 9 and date from 1816. Map collection Map of Utrecht (second quarter of the 18th century). 40-sheet wall map of Holland created by Jacob Aertsz Colom. The sheets were bound separately. The Atlas der Neederlanden contains maps of large sizes. Most atlases from the 17th and 18th century don‚Äôt have large maps because these didn‚Äôt fit in the bound volumes. The Atlas der Neederlanden forms an exception. The large-scale maps were folded to fit in the atlas and several wall maps of 4, 12 and 25 sheets were bound separately. The multi-sheet wall maps were popular decorations and therefore rarely preserved well. Because the separate sheets were bound and kept in the atlas, they remained in good condition with their lively colours still preserved. The atlas has nine volumes. Each volume is about a different part of the Netherlands: * Volume I: Gelderlandt, Utrecht & Over Yssel (Gelderland, Utrecht and Overijssel) * Volume II: Holland 1.

The record is the follow-up to the project Ninety Miles (2011), a video documentary accompanied by a studio-recorded CD which focused on the jazz and popular music traditions of New Orleans and New York and the musical and cultural connections with Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean. The name alludes to that stretch of waters between America, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. The album was recorded on May 18, 2010 at Cubadisco, one of the biggest music festivals in Cuba, at Teatro Amadeo Rold√°n in Havana, and released on September 24, 2012 via Concord Picante label.

The main building was opened in 1931 as a hotel and casino, but from 1934 it was used only as a hotel. Additions in the late 1950s included buildings designed by the architect F√©lix Candela that were roofed by reinforced concrete paraboloid shells. The interior was decorated with murals by well-known Mexican and Spanish artists. After the 1970s the hotel went into decline, and in 1994 was sold to a hotel chain that failed to pay taxes on the property. It was seized by the Mexican government and was auctioned off in 2001 as a site for construction of a discount store and a hypermarket. After demolition had begun there was a public outcry, and eventually some parts of the murals were preserved. History =Initial construction (1931)= Cuernavaca in the early 1930s held the homes of several former generals who later became presidents, Plutarco El√≠as Calles, L√°zaro C√°rdenas and Manuel √Åvila Camacho. It was also often visited by foreigners, particularly Anglo-Saxons. The first constitutional governor of Morelos state, Vicente Estrada Cajigal(es), authorized construction of a casino complex in Cuernavaca by the Compa√±√≠a Hispanoamericana de Hoteles. This was a consortium of Mexican businessmen backed by President Abelardo L. Rodr√≠guez. Manuel Su√°rez y Su√°rez, an Asturian entrepreneur, was the building contractor. The Casino de la Selva was inaugurated in 1931 near the train station. The layout was relatively simple. There was a large fountain at the entrance, then a main driveway between two blocks of rooms, one on each side. The drive led to the main hall, used as the gaming room. There was also an Olympic swimming pool, a pediment and some other facilities. The grounds contained bungalows set within the surrounding Amanalco Forest. Hundreds of the trees were at least 100 years old. Two of them were estimated to be over 1,000 years old. The site held springs and a wide variety of plant species. There was evidence of pre-Hispanic culture that could have been over 1500 years old. The pre-Columbian site was first excavated in the 1940s. =Early years (1931‚Äì46)= Detail of sculpture of Manuel Su√°rez at Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, Mexico City The Casino de la Selva was briefly the most luxurious watering spot in the Americas until the Garci-Crespo Hotel opened in Tehuac√°n in 1934. However, the owners were unable to pay their debts to the state or to the builders. Manuel Su√°rez was the main creditor and acquired the property in 1934. That year the new president L√°zaro C√°rdenas took office. One of his first decrees banned gambling in Mexico since he saw casinos as centers of vice. Su√°rez retained the property but ran it purely as a hotel. Su√°rez and the Valencian architect Jes√∫s Mart√≠ Mart√≠n founded the company V√≠as y Obras, which built facilities in the ports of Veracruz, Acapulco and other cities. Su√°rez built the Hotel Mocambo in Veracruz, and was involved in other industries, including sugar mills. In 1938 Malcolm Lowry moved to Cuernavaca to work on his novel Under the Volcano, and described the hotel in the first chapter, =Expansion (1946‚Äì70)= In 1946 the Casino de la Selva was closed so that V√≠as y Obras could undertake various enlargements under the direction of Mart√≠. The two blocks of rooms were each given a second floor, and a French-style garden was laid out in the area between them. New rooms were added to the main building. Other additions included a large convention hall, a bowling alley and cafeteria, a walkway around the Olympic pool, two more pools and sandy areas to give a beach-like atmosphere. The effect was much like the Hotel Mocambo. F√©lix Candela came to Mexico to escape Francoist Spain and worked for V√≠as y Obras from 1942 to 1947. He helped the architect Mart√≠ in his renovation of the Casino de la Selva. Candela is best known for his reinforced concrete shells, which he introduced to Mexico. These are based on hyperbolic paraboloids, in which straight beams can be used to build a saddle roof, and can cover large spans with minimal thickness. At the end of the 1950s the construction company of the brothers F√©lix, Antonio and Julia Candela built a dining room attached to an auditorium, and a non-denominational chapel in place of the fountain at the entrance, all with shell roofs. Candela's pupil, the architect Juan Antonio Tonda(es), designed the shells and about 30 bungalows in the south of the site and oversaw construction. Later the chapel was converted to a nightclub, the Club Jano, and then the Discoteca Mambo. Dining room in front of the auditorium The dining room, the Sal√≥n de los Relojes (Room of the Clocks), had a roof formed of five paraboloid sections with a large clock hanging from the central point where the arcs intersected. It showed the times of places around the world. The auditorium, reached via the Sal√≥n de los Relojes, had a single hyperbolic paraboloid roof and contained the mural La far√°ndula (Showbiz) by the Mexican artist Francisco Icaza, a tribute to the German playwright Bertolt Brecht. After 1965 Su√°rez started various unfinished projects such as a monorail below the pools and a forum to hold large murals by David Alfaro Siqueiros. Later this project was transferred to Mexico City where it became the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, leaving the building at the Casino de la Selva unfinished. The result of these later works was increasing diversity of architectural styles and growing maintenance costs. Lilia Su√°rez, daughter of the owner, assumed management of the Casino de la Selva in 1966. =Decline and abandonment (1970‚Äì2001)= From the 1970s until his death Su√°rez put most of his energy into the Hotel de M√©xico (now the World Trade Center) in the Federal District, a project that grew out of control. The Casino de la Selva was neglected and used only by foreign tourists. Su√°rez died in 1987. After this the hotel was used as a spa, and was sometimes rented for events such as wedding celebrations and graduations. Cuernavaca continued to expand, but most development happened outside the city center, which had expanded to include the hotel. A bus station was built beside the hotel and in 1991 the Plaza Cuernavaca shopping center opened to its east. In 1994 Su√°rez's heirs sold the property to the Grupo Situr-Sidek, a hotel company. The deed of sale does not seem to have included any stipulation that the murals were to be preserved. In 1996 the group defaulted on $63.7 million of taxes it owed to the Mexican government, and the Ministry of Finance seized the property. The Hotel Casino de la Selva was abandoned for several years and deteriorated quickly. The heritage authorities chose not to evaluate the property. Ownership was transferred to the Fondo Bancario de Protecci√≥n al Ahorro (Fobaproa: Bank Fund for the Protection of Savings). By 2001 the buildings had deteriorated badly, with murals crumbling from neglect, bat guano on interior walls, and litter and human excrement covering the floor of the main salon that held some of the finest murals. The buildings and over of green land were sold in 2001 for 10 million pesos, well below market value. The cultural wealth contained in the property was not declared. Fragment of the mural \\"La Hispanidad\\" by Josep Renau Artwork Fragmento of mural by the artist Jos√© Reyes Meza Su√°rez wanted the hotel to be a gathering place for intellectuals and artists, and commissioned various works of art for the walls and gardens. He hired Mexican and Spanish artists such as Jos√© Reyes Meza and Josep Renau to decorate the walls with murals showing Mexican history from the pre-Columbian period to the modern age. The murals would cover an area of . The hotel became the center of cultural activity in Cuernavaca and was visited by artists, writers and political activists. The former gaming room in the main hall came to be called the Sal√≥n de los Murales. The Spanish Republican artist Josep Renau painted a mural there of \\"La Hispanidad\\" a history of the Iberian Peninsula from the time of the Phoenicians to the conquest of America. The other side of the room held a 1965 mural by Jos√© Reyes Meza that depicted indigenous culture in the Valley of Mexico. The hall also had a mural of The Apocalypse by Jorge Flores, a disciple of David Alfaro Siqueiros. Renau's ', painted with his wife Manuela Ballester(es), depicted the conquest and colonization of America by the Spanish and covered more than . The walls of the rooms and corridors also held the work of David Alfaro Siqueiros, Dr. Atl, Benito Messeguer, Jorge Gonz√°lez Camarena, Francisco Icaza, Victor Moscoso and others. Sculptures in the gardens included pre-Hispanic allegories by Federico Canessi(de) and works by Antonio Ballester. A large equestrian statue of Hern√°n Cort√©s by the Spanish sculptor Florentino Aparicio was installed late in 1962. Su√°rez provided the hotel with a pottery workshop directed by Aparicio, where several noted potters learned their art. In 1980 the ceramicist Gustavo P√©rez Mirada was able to rent the workshop for a nominal sum with the help of his friend Ida Rodr√≠guez Prampolini. Famous visitors  In 1969 the mother of Lilia Rossbach was director of the hotel. She offered the author Carlos Monsiv√°is an old bungalow as a quiet space where he could write a book, his D√≠as de guardar, published in 1971. Rafael Bu√±uel, son of the filmmaker Luis Bu√±uel, spent six months living at the casino in 1971‚Äì72 developing avante-garde theatrical works, which were staged over the next four years. Carmen Montejo and Sergio Jim√©nez came to give classes to the performers. The pianist Alfonso Morquecho performed at the hotel. The Mexican painter and muralist Gerardo Murillo, better known as Dr. Atl, was among the best known guests. Dr. Atl would hold marathon conversations from three to four in the afternoon in the dining room with other visitors such as Mario Orozco Rivera and Benito Messeguer. A fragment of Dr. Atl's mural, Architectural view of the City of Puebla, is preserved in the Chapultepec Castle. Leonora Carrington lived in the casino while they built her house in Cuernavaca. Jules Dassin visited with Joseph Losey and Richard Burton, planning to film Under the Volcano, but the project fell through due to funding problems. Demolition controversy The property was sold at auction in 2001 to a joint venture of the American Costco discounter and the Mexican Comercial Mexicana supermarket chain. The partner companies quickly began to clear the site for construction of two giant stores, uprooting trees and tearing down many of the buildings. Costco said they would invest over $30 million in the Club de Precios (Price Club) store, which would generate 1,500 temporary and 500 permanent jobs. When the plans became public the Civic Front for the Defense of the Casino de la Selva was formed by local environmentalists, preservationists and small business owners, asking the city to maintain the hotel and turn the land around it into a park. Fragment of one of the murals The issue quickly gained national and international media attention. The painter Jos√© Reyes Meza was refused access to inspect the state of the murals. On 14 July 2001 it was reported that the Josep Renau Foundation of Valencia, Spain, had sent a communiqu√© to K≈çichir≈ç Matsuura of UNESCO asking him to exert pressure on the Mexican government to hold responsible those causing this \\"damage to the universal cultural heritage\\". The Civic Front organization filed lawsuits, organized a boycott of Costco's other Mexican stores, and held public demonstrations outside the construction site entrance. A group of Morelos state deputies drafted a proposal to urge the Federal Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) and Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) to conserve the historical and archaeological cultural heritage on the site. They described the damage to the murals due to demolition of part of the shell of the Casino de la Selva building as an act of aggression against the cultural heritage of humanity. They called on the City of Cuernavaca to take into consideration the opinion of the citizens, suspend the work and prepare a comprehensive plan for conservation and use of the cultural, historial and ecological resources. In August 2002 demonstrators held a lengthy sit-in, calling for access to the site so they could count the remaining trees. On 21 August 2001 protestors blocked access to the property for eight hours before being evicted by the authorities. 31 of the demonstrators were arrested and accused of riot, sabotage, assault, blocking public roads and incitement to crime. On 23 August 2002 the state authorities transferred 31 opponents of the shopping centre project who had refused to pay bail to Atlacholoaya prison and deployed 360 troops around the entrance to the site to prevent the arrival of a group of supporters from San Salvador Atenco, M√©xico. Six days later 15,000 people marched in protest through downtown Cuernavaca. Eventually the company agreed to save the murals and part of the surrounding forest. The hotel was demolished in the fall of 2002. During the excavation figurines and prehispanic ceramics were found. The INAH tried to intervene but was too late to stop the work. Aftermath Within a year the new Costco outlet and the new mega supermarket opened in two huge concrete blocks surrounded by a sea of asphalt. In 2003 the UN High Commission on Human Rights in Mexico condemned the project and criticized the local authorities for using excessive force in removing the protesters from the site. One of the organizers of the protests, Flor Guerrero, described the failure to protect the Casino de la Selva as symbolic of Mexico's acceptance of the U.S. free-trade gospel. Another local resident gave a different view, saying \\"They said we were all against those stores, but the stores may bring more benefits than harm. New jobs and investment were created, and there's a greater variety of products to choose from in those stores. Besides, the Casino de la Selva hotel never belonged to the people.\\" Costco opened an art museum named the Museo Muros to hold the Renau and Reyes Meza murals that had been salvaged as well as the Gelman collection of Mexican art. A reinforced concrete shell was built next to the museum in imitation of the Sal√≥n de los Relojes. The shell was poorly executed and does not achieve the feeling of lightness that was characteristic of Candela's work.

He served as the first known Count of Hermannstadt around 1210. Joachim was the forefather of the Szentgr√≥ti noble family. Family Joachim was born into the illustrious gens T√ºrje, which originated from Zala County. His father Gecse I, was the first known member of the kindred. He had at least three siblings: Denis I, the father of the powerful baron Denis II, Gecse II, who served as isp√°n of Zala (1225) and Bars counties (1236‚Äì1240). An unidentified sister was also mentioned in 1254, when she was widow of a deceased male member of the gens √Åkos. Joachim had two sons from his unidentified wife: Thomas participated in the Battle of Mohi, and later functioned as the isp√°n of Karak√≥ isp√°nate. The Szentgr√≥ti family descended from him. Joachim's younger son was Philip, an influential prelate in the second half of the 13th century, who served as Bishop of Zagreb from 1247 or 1248 to 1262, and as Archbishop of Esztergom from 1262 until his death, and was a strong confidant of the Hungarian royal family. Military career Joachim was a faithful soldier of Andrew II of Hungary. Around 1210, he served as the first known Count of Hermannstadt (or Szeben; ), and in this capacity, he was the head of the Transylvanian Saxons living in the wider region of Hermannstadt (now Sibiu in Romania). When an uprising broke out in Vidin against Boril of Bulgaria in that year, the Bulgarian ruler was unable to suppress the rebellion without external assistance and turned to Andrew II, reminding him \\"their reliable friendship\\". In response, the Hungarian king sent Joachim to lead an army of Saxons, Vlachs, Sz√©kelys and Pechenegs across the Carpathian Mountains to fight for Boril of Bulgaria against three rebellious Cuman chieftains, according to a royal charter issued in 1250. The record suggests that the four ethnic groups were subjected to the Counts of Hermannstadt in the early 13th century. Joachim first routed the three Cuman chieftains who tried to halt his invasion, killing two of them in the battlefield, while the third one Karas was captured and sent to the Hungarian royal court as a prisoner. Following that Joachim's army marched along the Danube to Vidin, and besieged the castle. According to the 1250 charter, the Hungarian troops set fire to two gates of the fort and \\"fought valiantly\\". Joachim himself was gravely wounded in the skirmish, but Vidin was successfully captured and was given back to Boril, suppressing the rebellion against him. For his military service and merits, Joachim was granted lands in Slanje (today in Croatia) and Vara≈ædin County. Four decades later, B√©la IV of Hungary issued a royal charter in Gy≈ër on 23 June 1250, which became the only source of information on Joachim's military campaign. In the document, the king confirmed Thomas and Philip, the sons of the late Joachim, in their inherited paternal land possessions, describing the merits of the three members of the T√ºrje kindred. Joachim also participated in Andrew's military campaign against the Principality of Halych in 1211. He acted as a pristaldus (royal commissioner or \\"bailiff\\") in 1214, when comes Nicholas was inducted into the ownership of the land of Lendva (present-day Lendava, Slovenia).Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus T√ºrje, Szentgr√≥t branch) References Sources  * Category:12th-century Hungarian people Category:13th-century Hungarian people Category:Medieval Hungarian military leaders Joachim ","title":"Joachim T√ºrje"},{"id":"57357613","text":"Drew Skundrich (born September 17, 1995) is an American soccer player who currently plays for Sacramento Republic FC in the USL Championship.

Urszula Zamoyska (1750-1808), was a Polish noblewoman and socialite, niece of king Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. She is known for her public role during the reign of her uncle, when she played the ceremonial role of the hostess of his court. Life She was the daughter of Ludwika Maria Poniatowska and Jan Jakub Zamoyski. Her parents separated shortly after her birth. In 1763, her maternal uncle, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, was elected king of Poland. In 1773, she married Count Wincenty Potocki (d. 1825). Her marriage was discontinued by a divorce in 1777. According to the diary of the king, the fault was with her spouse. Her divorce was subject to a poem by Ignacy Potocki. Gregory Potemkin presented a marriage proposal, but the king did not support it. She married secondly to Michal Jerzy Mniszech in 1781. =Hostess of the Royal Court= She played a significant role during the last two decades of her uncle's reign. As the king was unmarried and there was no queen, his favorite niece Urszula Zamoyska often played a ceremonial role by his side, and accompanied him in public. The king reportedly had the palace in Dƒôblin remade for her. In October 1781, the meeting between the king and the heir to the Russian throne, Grand Duke Paul, took place in her palace in Wi≈õniowiec in Wo≈Çy≈Ñ in her presence, during which she was given a portrait encrusted with diamonds by the Grand Duchess Maria; she herself visited Saint Petersburg a few months later. Described as a haughty beauty, she played the role of hostess at the royal court of king Stanis≈Çaw and was a leading figure in the aristocratic high society life of Warsaw.Biogram zosta≈Ç opublikowany w 1976 r. w XXI tomie Polskiego S≈Çownika Biograficznego She formed a theatrical society which staged plays at court consisting of amateur actors from the nobility. She had a good relationship to the Russian ambassador Stackelberg, and arranged the reception on his arrival in Poland. In 1787, she accompanied her uncle the king on his meeting with empress Catherine the Great in Kani√≥w, during which she was given the Order of St. Catherine. On their return to Poland, she was the hostess on the king's meeting with emperor Joseph II, during which she staged plays and ballets for his amusement. During the Great Sejm (1787-1791), Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz's political comedy, The Return of the Deputy (1790), was performed in her salon. In the spring of 1791, she and her mother visited Paris during a difficult period in Poland, which attracted bad publicity. During the crisis of 1793, she and her spouse left for Grodno. Reportedly the Russian ambassador Jacob Sievers threatened to have her property, which was now situated in the Russian sector of Poland, confiscated, which contributed to the king giving in to Russian demands.Biogram zosta≈Ç opublikowany w 1976 r. w XXI tomie Polskiego S≈Çownika Biograficznego During the crisis of 1794, it was noted that she and her spouse had plans to evacuate to K√∂nigsberg, though it is unconfirmed if they did leave. =Later life= On 7 January 1795, she and her family joined king Stanis≈Çaw in Grodno, and remained by his side during the Third Partition of Poland. Reportedly, she and her mother, along with their coterie and urged by the Russian N. Repnin, contributed to persuade the king to sign his abdication on 25 November, as they feared that his refusal would lead to a Russian confiscation of their property and their ruin.Biogram zosta≈Ç opublikowany w 1976 r. w XXI tomie Polskiego S≈Çownika Biograficznego After the abdication on 25 November 1795, the confiscation of the Mniszch property and her palace in Deblin was lifted, which she could control herself after having visited her property on the summer of 1796. On the mission of Repnin, she was also given the task to persuade J√≥zef Poniatowski to join them in exile in Russia. In February 1797, she followed her uncle, the deposed king, to St Petersburg. She participated in the coronation of Paul I, was given the honorary rank of Imperial Portrait Lady of the Russian court, and was celebrated by the Russian aristocracy. After the death of her uncle the former king in 1798, Urszula Zamoyska returned to Poland and settled with her spouse in Wi≈õniowiec. After being widowed in 1806, she lived in Vienna and Paris. Legacy She was subject of many Latin poems by nuncio AM Durini, and the \\"Czestochowa Song\\" by Celestyna Czaplica. She described the 1787 journey to Kani√≥w to her mother, and her letter was published in French by Andrzej Edward Ko≈∫mian (it was also published in Russian by P. Saweljew in 1843).

It was the home of architect Minoru Yamasaki, designed by him in 1972. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. History Minoru Yamasaki was born in Seattle in 1912, studied architecture at the University of Washington, then moved the New York City, where he took graduate courses at New York University before accepting his first architecture position with the firm of Githens and Keally in 1935. Yamasaki spent the next decade in New York with various firms, and married Teruko Hirashiki in 1941. In 1945 left for Detroit to become the new head of design for Smith, Hinchman, and Grylls. He stayed until 1949, when he left to establish his own practice. When the Yamasakis first came to Detroit, they found it difficult to find suitable housing, due in part to a persistent anti-Japanese sentiment in Detroit's suburbs. They eventually purchased a farmhouse on Livernois Road, in Troy, Michigan, which was then very rural. By the early 1970s, however, the encroaching suburbification had reached Troy, and the Yamasakis were able to sell for a profit. By this time, they were also able to purchase land in areas from which they were previously excluded. In 1972, they purchased this lot, and Minoru Yamasaki designed the house. The house embodies Yamasaki's approach to architectural design, expressed in residential architecture. Minoru Yamasaki lived in this house until his death in 1986. Description The Yamasaki house is a two-story, flat roofed, L-shaped structure. It is constructed on an aluminum frame and clad with bricks. The front elevation features an entry through the interior of the L. The entry is on the second level of the house. Other elevations feature tall curtain walls. A pool addition is to one side. The interior is an open floor plan and simple design, reflecting Yamasaki's philosophy that the interior of a house should recede into the background, allowing the furniture, artwork, and people to become the focal points.

Life Macchetti studied music in Venice and joined the Benedictine Order, which assigned him to the monastery in Rovigo as solicitor in 1669.Carolyn Gianturco, voce Macchetti, Teofilo, in The New Grove of Music and Musicians. Second Edition, edited by Stanley Sadie, executive editor John Tyrrell, vol. 15: Liturgy to Martin≈Ø, London, Macmillan, 2001-2002, p. 449. He stayed in Rovigo until 1674, but his interest for history and music caused him to travel for research to Venice (in 1672 and in 1673) and to Rome, where he stayed for four years (from 1675 to 1679).Gabriele Giacomelli, Macchetti, Teofilo (sub voce), in Dizionario biografico degli italiani, vol. 66, Roma, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 2006, available on-line on Treccani.it After that he made stops in Loreto and Spoleto, and then settled in Pisa, where he became Chapel Master of the Duomo in 1681. Macchetti kept this role for the rest of his life, supervising the musical life in Pisa and teaching regularly (his most well-known student was Giovan Carlo Maria Clari); however, he continued to travel for his studies of music history (documented stays in Rome, Volterra, Siena, and numerous other Tuscan cities). Conti di musiche 451x451px While working, Macchetti kept a detailed diary, entitled Conti di musiche (translated as Tales of Music, or Musical Tales, or Tales from Music), which is preserved today in the Biblioteca Universitaria of Pisa.Ilaria Zolesi, I manoscritti musicali della Biblioteca Universitaria di Pisa. Storia e catalogo, Lucca, LIM, 1998. From the notes in his diary, precious information regarding the musical activity of a 1600-1700 chapel can be understood. Macchetti describes his duties, the music that was performed, and his academic activity in minute detail. In addition, he documented many distinctive traits of the music performed at that time.Carolyn Gianturco, Lucia Pierotti Boccaccio, Teofilo Macchetti and Sacred Music in Pisa (1694-1713), in Siegfried Gmeinwieser, David Hiley, J√∂rg Riedlbauer (a cura di), Musicologia humane. Studies in Honor of Warren and Ursula Kirkendale, Firenze, Olschki, 1994, pp. 393-415. Curiosit√† musicali His interest for antique music is gathered in Curiosit√† musicali (translated as Musical Curiosity, or Music Trivia) which dates back to beginning in 1711 and is preserved today in the Biblioteca Universitaria of Pisa. In Curiosit√†, Macchetti verifies many anecdotes about antique music circulating at the time (for example, the anecdote that Pythagoras understood the concept of musical consonance by listening to the sound of hammers on anvils), attests the circulation of medieval dissertations as well as those of the Renaissance in Italy (Macchetti demonstrated knowing very well the dissertations of Johannes de Muris, Johannes Tinctoris, Glarean, Vincenzo Galilei and Athanasius Kircher) reflecting on the concept of tempo, and studied the evolution of performance customs (for example, he observed how the mass Aeterna Christi munera by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina was performed more quickly over the years). The Curiosit√† represents the first Italian attempt at creating a true and proper History of Music, which precedes, by almost 40 years, the most famous treaty of Giovanni Battista MartiniGiovanni Battista Martini, Storia della musica, Bologna, Istituto delle Scienze/Bologna, Lelio della Volpe, 1757. Digitalized on IMSLP. in which he recognizes Curiosit√† musicali as its essential foundation. The angle of Curiosit√† is much more practical than theoretical, and it also documents the customs of performance of the time. This last fact renders it a priceless direct source for performance customs of sacred music of the 1700s.Beatrice Pescerelli, Teofilo Macchetti (1632-1714). Un dimenticato precursore della ricerca musicologica, in Acta Musicologica, XLVIII/1 (gennaio-giugno 1976), Kassel-Basel-London-New York-Praha, B√§renreiter, 1976, pp. 104-111.A transcription of Curiosit√† musicali, edited by Massimo Redaelli, is available on Manuscripts of Italian Music Theory in Translation. Works In Conti di musiche, Macchetti describes the performances of many of his works, but it seems today that only two compositions remain: Sacri concerti di salmi, printed in Bologna in 1687 (samples of this print are found at the Museo internazionale e biblioteca della musica of Bologna and at the Biblioteca Diocesana of Lucca)Macchetti, Teofilo (sub voce), in Dizionario enciclopedico universale della musica e dei musicisti, edited by Alberto Basso, Appendix, Torino, UTET, 1990, p. 504., and the Responsori della liturgia dei defunti. It is assumed that consistent traces of his production can be preserved indirectly (for example, copies and re-elaborated versions by his students or other successors in the chapel at the Cathedral of Pisa) or even autographs found at the Musical History Archive at the Opera Primaziale Pisana. As aforementioned, the Biblioteca Universitaria of Pisa preserves his written works, some of which have been digitallized.

The Liber regum, written about a century later in Navarre, records his name, Diago Royz, and says explicitly that El Cid and Jimena had one son. Ambrosio Huici Miranda's theory that Diego was the son of El Cid by an earlier wife is based on the less reliable Mocedades de Rodrigo.

Currently, reindeer are the only semi-domesticated animal which naturally belongs to the North. Reindeer herding is conducted in nine countries: Norway, Finland, Sweden, Russia, Greenland, Alaska (the United States), Mongolia, China and Canada. A small herd is also maintained in Scotland. Reindeer herding is conducted by individuals within some kind of cooperation, in forms such as families, districts, S√°mi and Yakut villages and sovkhozy (collective farms). A person who conducts reindeer herding is called a reindeer herder and approximately 100,000 people are engaged in reindeer herding today around the circumpolar North. Domestication The domestication of the reindeer does not lend itself to a simple explanation. There is no doubt that when the glaciers retreated at the end of the last Ice Age, people followed reindeer to the North, using traps during the reindeer hunt. Modern archaeological data (rock art) suggest that domestication may have taken place for the first time in the Sayan Mountains between Russia and Mongolia, possibly 2-3 thousand years ago. According to another theory, the Tungus (the ancestors of the present Evenks and Evens) independently domesticated reindeer to the east of Lake Baikal, and that reindeer herding originated in several places simultaneously. Reindeer herders have their own stories about how reindeer were domesticated, and about the relationship between wild and domestic reindeer. Whatever the debate, the very fact of domination of a reindeer led to a reindeer revolution that spread to the North, East, and West. Sleds pulled by reindeer appeared later than dog sleds. The reindeer sleds made accessible areas of the tundra and mountains, which even now can only be accessed by helicopter. Reindeer became the preferred vehicle on the expanses of Eurasia. S√°mi Sami people in Norway, c. 1900, painted by Wilhelm Peters The S√°mi people lived and worked in so-called siiddat (reindeer herding groups) and reindeer were used for transport, milk and meat production. The Siida is an ancient S√°mi community system within a designated area but it can also be defined as a working partnership where the members had individual rights to resources but helped each other with the management of the herds, or when hunting and fishing. The Siida could consist of several families and their herds. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the traditional regions of Saami reindeer husbandry were divided by state borders between four states: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, which led to the destabilization of traditional reindeer husbandry practices. The state borders (in 1852 between Norway and Russia and in 1889 between Sweden and Finland, then owned by Russia) have divided the reindeer Siids. =Scandinavia= In Scandinavia, about 6,500 Saami are engaged in reindeer herding. In Norway and Sweden reindeer herding is characterized by large herds and a high degree of mechanization in all regions. The main product of reindeer herding is meat. However, skins, bones, and horns are important raw materials for making clothes and handicrafts. The involvement of young people in Norway and Sweden is hindered by legislative acts, and the lack of pastures and economic opportunities hamper the growth of the industry. The total number of reindeer in the Sami territory, with the exception of Russia, is privately owned, despite the fact that in many aspects the reindeer grazing is carried out collectively within the framework of the Siid. Norway Reindeer herding in Norway In Norway, there are six pasture territories, divided into 77 pasture areas. Only ethnic Saami have the right to reindeer husbandry in these areas. The reindeer is also bred in southern Norway in special concession areas. There, reindeer herding can also be practiced by non-Saami Norwegians. The reindeer graze on pastures with an area of approximately 146 thousand km2 in the provinces of Finnmark, Troms, Nordland and Trendelag, which is 40% of the mainland part of Norway. Reindeer herding is managed by the Norwegian Reindeer Husbandry Administration, which is directly subordinate to the Ministry of Agriculture of Norway. 2936 reindeer herders graze about 240 thousands deer, most of which are based in the province of Finnmark. Reindeer herding is regulated by the New Norwegian Reindeer Herding Act of 2007. Only specified persons have the right to a reindeer earmark and to conduct reindeer husbandry in the S√°mi reindeer herding area. Only a person who is a S√°mi and themselves, their parents or their grandparents have or had reindeer herding as their primary occupation qualifies for an earmark. The number of reindeer in Norway is calculated after slaughtering but before the calving starts in May, and it fluctuates around 200,000. In Norway, the reindeer numbers were 242,000 in 1990, 172,000 in 2000 and 241,000 in 2007. The most common reasons for these fluctuations include difficult climatic situations during several winters, increasing predation levels and poor pasture conditions.Resursregnskap for reindriftsn√¶ringen, reindrifts√•ret 2006/2007, Reindriftsforvaltningen 2008 The economic situation for reindeer herders in Norway varies greatly. Modern reindeer herders have to adapt to a wide variety of changes in the local, regional and national economy. Reindeer herding is in terms of taxation seen as a for-profit-business and for a reindeer herder a common tax form is as a private entrepreneur. Today, the income of individual reindeer herders consists of the production of meat and raw materials such as skins, bones and horns. Additional sources of income include financial subsidies and compensation. More than 50% of the costs in the industry in all the six areas of reindeer husbandry are related to the costs of running and maintaining mechanical equipment. Other high costs are related to other equipment and constructions.Dieƒëut, Analyse av den samiske reindriftens √∏konomiske tilpasning, nr 4, 2006, S√°mi Instituhtta, Norden Norway has since 1976, an agreement for reindeer husbandry which is called the Reindeer Husbandry Agreement (Norwegian: Reindriftsavtalen) and the main purpose of this is to preserve and develop reindeer husbandry based on its traditions. The agreement is a result of the Norwegian authorities‚Äô views on reindeer herding and especially in relation to the support of the S√°mi culture and reindeer husbandry as a S√°mi industry. The agreement reflects the political objectives and guidelines for reindeer husbandry. The economic support for the years 2008‚Äì2009 amounted to 97 million NOK (10.1 M Euro). The financial support agreement includes activity supports, production bonuses, early slaughter supplements, calf slaughter payments, district support, special transition assistances and other payments.Foreskrifter til Reindriftsavtalen 2008/2009 m.m., Reindriftsforvaltningen, Alta 2008 Sweden Under kalvemerking i Gabna sameby i Nord-Sverige In Sweden, reindeer herding is practised almost everywhere in the provinces of Norrbotten, V√§sterbotten, and J√§mtland, and in parts of the provinces of Dalarna, V√§sternorrland, and G√§vleborg. Reindeer pastures occupy about one-third of the territory of Sweden. Reindeer herding employs about 2,500 people in Sweden and the number of reindeer owners is a total of about 4,600 people. According to figures from 2005, 77% of the country's reindeer are owned by men.http://www.sametinget.se The Saami Village (in Swedish: the Sameby), the structural unit of S√°mi reindeer herding in Sweden is divided into 51 Sami reindeer herding villages which are both economic associations and geographical areas. Of those are 33 mountain and 10 forest Sami reindeer herding villages, and eight concession Sami reindeer herding villages. Contemporary reindeer husbandry is regulated by the Swedish reindeer husbandry act.Renn√§ringslagen 1971: 437 - http://www.notisum.se/Pub/Doc.aspx?url=/rnp/sls/lag/19710437.htm According to this Act, the right to pursue reindeer herding only belongs to the S√°mi people. Only a person who is member of S√°mi reindeer herding village (Sameby) has reindeer herding rights, in other words, may engage in reindeer husbandry in the S√°mi reindeer herding village to which she/he belongs. The only exception are concession villages, as they engage in reindeer husbandry with special permission from the County Administrative Board (in Swedish: L√§nsstyrelsen). The reindeer in the concession villages are owned by non Sami who also often own the land on which their reindeer graze. However, according to the reindeer husbandry Act the actual reindeer herding in a concession village must be conducted by a Sami. A reindeer owner in a concession village is not allowed to own more than 30 reindeer. Concession villages exist only in the Torne Valley (the area on the Swedish side of the river which marks the border between Sweden and Finland). Any reindeer has to be marked in the ears. A reindeer earmark is a combination of one to many cuts in a reindeer's ears which all together tells who the reindeer owner is. There are around 20 different approved cuts and in addition some 30 different combinations of cuts, and all those cuts and combinations have their own name. All reindeer in the Sami reindeer husbandry area are marked with the owner's registered earmark by 31 October in the year of its birth. Before an earmark is implemented, it is be approved by the earmark committee consisting of three to five members.Renn√§ringslagen 1971:437 The number of reindeer in Sweden fluctuates and during the 1900s it has varied between 150,000 and 300,000 reindeer. In Sweden the reindeer numbers were 253,000 in 1995, 221,000 in 2000 and 220,000 in 2007. The number of reindeer is counted after slaughtered reindeer are withdrawn from the herd, and before the calving starts, which is usually in may. For each S√°mi village, the maximum number of reindeer is decided by the County Administrative Board and the reindeer are counted each year by the reindeer herders themselves. On the individual level there are no maximum numbers for reindeer.http://www.bd.lst.se Basic ear marks for marking Finnish reindeers =Finland= In Finland, reindeer husbandry is practiced through a system of reindeer herding districts (in Finish: paliskunta ‚Äì b√°lgosat). There are 56 districts in the reindeer husbandry area, 41 of which are in the Province of Lapland and the remaining 15 are in the Province of Oulu. 13 of the districts are so called S√°mi districts. The districts have strictly defined boundaries and they vary in size and number of reindeer. The total area of reindeer husbandry in Finland is approximately 33% of the surface of the country or about 122,936 km2Rensk√∂tsellag 14.9.1990/848 Reindeer herding in Finland is not the prerogative of only ethnic Sami, and any European Union citizen can engage in this type of farm. However, there are some conditions. The owner of the reindeer must be approved as a member by a reindeer herding district (Finish: paliskunta ‚Äì renbeteslag ‚Äì b√°lggos) and must permanently reside in the municipality to which the district belongs. In total, there are about 5,600 reindeer herders, most of whom are Finnish by nationality. The number of reindeer owners in Finland is about 6,700.http://www.paliskunnat.fi In the beginning of the 20th century, the number of reindeer in Finland was slightly over 100,000, and by 1959‚Äì1960 it had reached 140,000. During the 1970s and 1980s the number increased rapidly and reached over 250,000 reindeer at a maximum. The number of reindeer in Finland was about 207,000 reindeer in 2004/2005. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (in Finnish: Maa- ja mets√§talousministeri√∂) regulates the number of reindeer by confirming the largest permissible numbers of living reindeer for each district. If the number of reindeer in a district exceeds the permitted level, the district must reduce the number of its reindeer to below the largest permissible number.The Encycloapedia of Saami Culture The largest permissible number of reindeer owned by a reindeer husbandry entrepreneur is 300 animals in the southern region of the reindeer husbandry area and 500 animals in the northern parts of the area. In Finland, reindeer husbandry at the individual level in terms of taxation is not treated as a for-profit- business. Instead the reindeer herding district serves as a joint company for the reindeer owners. The district reports all incomes and costs within the district. The vast majority of reindeer owners in Finland practise reindeer husbandry as a supplement to agriculture and forestry. With regard to ethnic groups in Finland, reindeer herding is from the economic point of view the most important for S√°mi people. The annual total revenue from reindeer husbandry in Finland is estimated to be 60 million Euro with the main product being meat. In 1999‚Äì2000, 93,000 reindeer were slaughtered, producing 2.1 million kilograms of meat. In addition to meat production, reindeer are also an extremely valuable resource for both summer and winter tourism, as they are one of the main attractions for foreign tourists. Numbers from 1994-2000 show that 60-80% of reindeer husbandries income is from meat and about 10% from compensation and 10% from aid. Only a small part comes from investments and other incomes. Numbers from the same years show that about 40% of the costs are related to herding activities, about 20% of costs to cross country traffic and the rest to damages caused by reindeer, administrative costs, office supplies and equipment and other utilities.Sustainable Reindeer Husbandry ‚Äì Arctic Council 2000-2002, J-L. Jernsletten, K. Klokov =Russia= Archangel reindeer Reindeer breeding of the Kola Sami in the North-West of Russia underwent a transformation in the 19th century with the arrival of 65 Komi reindeer herders with their 600 deer. Reindeer herding on the basis of semi- grazing was transformed into large-scale farms with a focus on productivity. Collectivization in the 30s of the last century continued the further transformation of reindeer husbandry as the size of the herds increased. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, reindeer husbandry was neglected. Reindeer husbandry is managed by two state farms and reindeer herders are hired workers of these farms, as in the Soviet period. In total, about 200 people are employed in Sami reindeer herding, still mostly Komi by nationality. The remaining smaller part of reindeer herders are of the Sami nationality, Russians and Ukrainians. Nowadays about 40‚Äì50,000 reindeer graze, this is less than half of the livestock that was grazed several decades ago. The share of private property in reindeer husbandry in the last decade has grown significantly. Evenki Evenki are the most widespread of the Tungus speaking people and can be found in various regions of the Russian Federation: through the Lower Yenisey valley through the Evenk Autonomous Okrug, Irkutskaya and Amur Oblast to Khabarovsk Krai, Buryatia, North-West and South Sakha (Yakutia); they also live in China and a small group in Mongolia. Their number is probably 50,000 people, most of whom live on the territory of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), a federal subject of the Russian Federation. Being traditional nomads, they practice traditional types of economy, including reindeer herding and hunting. =Russia= Reindeer pulling a sleigh, Russia Summer pastures are located on watersheds, while winter pastures are located in river basins. Hunting for wild deer has traditionally served as a by-catch for reindeer herders and was conducted seasonally by small groups of hunters in river crossings. Nomadism is of key importance to the Evenk culture. As a result of Soviet collectivization, the nomads forcibly became sedentary, which resulted in the disintegration of social structures and cultural identity. Deer are used for riding and transporting loads and are grazed without dogs. Modern vehicles only partially replaced deer. Evenk reindeer herding serves as a model for small-scale reindeer herding where deer are used as vehicles for milk production. Reindeer milking, Russia Traditionally, the number of deer varied from several head to two or three dozen head per family. Relations with the deer were close, deer were saddled and milked, and the process of domestication continued through the use of millennial techniques, such as the use of salt, smoke to control insects and protection from predators. Evenk reindeer herding is closely connected with the Sayan reindeer herding (Todzhans, Tofalars, Czataans). On the reindeer Evenks traveled along the whole Eastern Siberia, spread out on 7 million square kilometers. As a result, there are about 20 clearly defined Evenk subgroups, and reindeer herding has become an important indicator of the Evenk identity. The industrial development of certain parts of Siberia had catastrophic consequences for some groups of Evenks, and recently this process is gaining momentum due to accelerated extraction of minerals, construction of pipelines and development of the timber industry complex. The fate of the Evenk reindeer herders in the Upper Bureysky District of the Amur Oblast serves as a reminder that reindeer husbandry in these regions may come to an end. =China= Reindeer husbandry in China is limited to the territory of one small area in the northeast of the country between 50¬∞ and 53¬∞ N. Currently 234 Evenk are employed in reindeer husbandry, distributed among 20 families, and about 1,000 deer grazing. These Evenk reindeer herders are what remained of the once large group of Evenk hunters who freely crossed the Russian-Chinese border. When military operations broke out on the Soviet- Chinese border in the 1960s, this group found itself in the territory of China. Intending to put an end to free migration across the state border, the Chinese authorities moved these people deep into the country: first to Alonsohn, then to Monkey, and finally to the settlement of Alougoya. The deer were collectivized in 1967. The state bought out all deer from the reindeer herders and began to pay the shepherds wages despite the fact that the deer continued to be under the care of their former owners and shepherds. Grazing of these deer is comparable to that of other peoples in the south of Siberia: The small number of reindeer that were owned by the families were milked and used as a means of transport. Deer were highly valued and were not slaughtered for meat. Improving the health status and diversity of the herd, as well as the economic situation of reindeer herders, are the top priorities for this region. The production of antlers for marketing on the Asian pharmacological market is the main source of income, and attempts are being made to develop small-scale tourism in the tribal communities located near the largest city in the region, Genhe. =Mongolia= Tsaatans,(Reindeers) have lived in the remote, deep forest of northern Mongolia. They are one of the few remaining tribes of its kind left as modern development makes its way into their remote habitat, their ancient traditions are now at risk of dying out. Nowadays, there is a little income in the Tsaatan communities because of tourism in Mongolia.

Biography  = Youth = Ivan Kalmykov was born in the District of Grozny in the Terek Region on September 5, 1890. His father was an old trader from Kharkov. He was brought up in the Alexandrovskaya Missionary Theological Seminary in the village of Ardon, Terek District (present-day North Ossetia). He joined the service in 1909 in the Tiflis Junker Military School as a Junker of rank in the direction of the Ataman of the Groznenskaya Village and the Ataman of the Kizlyar-Grebensky Department. In 1910 he was promoted to Non- commissioned officer. On October 30, 1913, he submitted a report to the Commander of the 2nd Sapper Company requesting \\"a petition for his transfer for the benefit of service to the Ussuri Cossack Division\\" as a patriotic Cossack. His request was granted and on January 20, 1914, he was transferred to the Ussuri Cossack Regiment. = World War I = He took part in the First World War, holding the rank of Centurion (—Å–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫) from 1915, then Captain (–ü–æ–¥–ø–æ—Ä—É—á–∏–∫) from 1917, in the Ussuri Cossack Regiment. During the war he received four awards, including the Order of St. Vladimir and the Sword of St. George, in battle on Dec. 17, 1916, on the ridge of Poiana-Kiriyak, commanding two and a half hundred and guarding the right flank of the 12th Romanian Infantry Division retreating into the valley of the River Solchya. He held his position and thereby ensured the evacuation of the Romanian Division, despite repeated and persistent attacks by the Germans to flank around the rear and surround the Romanians. = Russian Civil War = Following the February Revolution, he returned to Primorye in the fall of 1917. With the outbreak of the October Revolution and the Bolshevik seizure of power, he took to guerrilla fighting against the newly created Red Army. First he fought against the Bolsheviks from his base at Grodekovo and, on 5 September 1918 at the head of the Special Ussuri Cossack Detachment, he occupied Khabarovsk. On September 17, he took over as head of the Khabarovsk Garrison. On October 22, 1918, the 5th Extraordinary Great Military Circle of the Ussuri Cossack Army, for distinctions in battle against the Bolsheviks, promoted to him the rank of Major-General and elected him the Military Ataman of the Ussuri Cossack Army. In March 1919 he was awarded by Ataman Grigory Semyonov for his combat services with the Order of St. George, 4th Class. On December 30, 1919, Semyonov appointed him an assistant in the position of Marching Ataman of the Far Eastern Cossacks, and on January 30, 1920, the head of the Ussuri group of forces and the Khabarovsk Military District. Kalmykov became infamous for the number of robberies, murders, and wanton rape and looting committed by his soldiers, which aroused the indignation of many leaders in the White Movement, first among them Admiral Kolchak himself. On January 4, 1920, Admiral Kolchak, on the eve of his arrest, transferred the entirety of military and civil power in the Far East to Ataman Grigory M. Semyonov. At the same time, the real power belonged to General S. N. Rozanov, who was the Chief of Staff of the Amur region in Vladivostok; to Ivan Kalmykov in Khabarovsk, and to the Amur Army Ataman Kuznetsov in Blagoveshchensk. All these Atamans depended heavily on Japanese money and troops. Rozanov was removed from power on January 31, 1920, after which the Provisional Government of the Primorsky Regional Zemstvo Board assumed control in Primorye. The authority of Kuznetsov ceased on February 4, 1920, after which Kalmykov remained alone with the Zemstvo, who moved their troops against him. Under the command of Ataman Kalmykov, the Ussuri Cossack detachment left Khabarovsk on February 13 and transferred the Ussuri Host to the Chinese territory over the ice. Shortly before, Kalmykov seized 622kg/1372lb of gold from the Khabarovsk branch of the State Bank, secretly transferring it as a loan to the Japanese command. = Death = Representatives of the Bolshevik Government in Moscow and the White Regional Zemstvo Board unanimously protested against Kalmykov's division's stay on Chinese territory. Under mounting pressure, the detachment was disarmed on February 29, 1920 on the Chinese shore of Ussuri Bay, opposite Bikin Station. The Officers and all healthy fighters were escorted to Fujin CityFugdin, where on March 8, the Ataman was arrested by the Chinese military authorities together with Major-General N.N. Sukhodolsky and Captain 1st Rank V. V. Bezuar. Under escort, part of the detachment were sent to Lahasusu. On March 12, the ill and injured Cossacks were transferred from Lakhasusu to the village of Mikhailo-Semyonovskaya. Kalmykov was charged with the appropriation of 917kg/2022lb of gold, the murder of representatives of the International Red Cross - Swede Sven Hedblom and Norwegian Ole Opshaug - near the Pogranichnaya Station, as well as in the shelling of a detachment of Chinese gunboats on the Amur River in October 1919. Kalmykov said that his testimony would be given either to the Emissaries of the legitimate White Russian government, or to the international commission, but not to the Chinese military. On March 21, 1920, General Sukhodolsky died, and Kalmykov and Bezoar were transported to the city of Jilin on April 16, where they were placed in the building of the gendarme. Initially, the detainees were kept in complete isolation, but on April 30 they met with a Japanese military adviser. After the conversation between the Japanese and General Bao Guiqin, Kalmykov got an opportunity to meet with the Russian Consul V.A. Brattsov. Russian diplomats petitioned for the release of those arrested, but the Chinese stated that the Ataman was accused of attacking Chinese warships and crossing the Chinese border with weapons. The Provisional Government in the Far East demanded that Kalmykov be transferred to Vladivostok in custody. At the behest of the Russian Envoy in Beijing, Prince Nikolai A. Kudashev, Brattsov demanded the relief of Kalmykov in late May 1920, after which the Chinese allowed the Ataman to visit the Russian consulate 1-2 times a week. During these visits, an escape plan was drawn up on July 13, and Kalmykov hid in one of the buildings in the territory of the consulate. Although the alibi of consular workers was prepared in advance, the Chinese authorities rejected their explanations and placed soldiers on the premises of the institution. In this situation, Nikolai A. Kudashev sent Consul General A.A. Kolokolov to Jilin. On August 25, Chinese soldiers discovered the hiding place of Kalmykov. At the request of the Russian Envoy, Jilin's authorities replied that the Ataman would be sent to Beijing, and from there to Vladivostok. The Japanese refused to participate in the extradition of Kalmykov. At the beginning of September 1920, the Ataman, escorted by the convoy to Jilin once again attempted to flee from the city, wounded the Chinese officer, and was subsequently shot and killed by the Chinese soldiers during the escape attempt.

Since the union was founded in 1895 in Rhenish Prussia, it is treated as a legal entity under the protection of the Federal Republic of Germany, based on a government decree signed on 11 March 1895. The Association‚Äôs main office is based in CologneStatus of the German Association of the Holy Land (memento of the original, 24 September 2015). Pilgrim House Tabgha, Jerusalem __TOC__  History  The German Association of the Holy Land was founded on 30 July 1895 at a general meeting. It was created through the merging of the Association of the Holy Grave (German: Verein vom Heiligen Grabe) and the Palestine Union of the German Catholics. The former was founded in 1855 by the initiative of the then canon of the Cologne Cathedral Gottfried Strau√ü and the latter was established in 1885. Following the First World War and after the outbreak of the Second World War, the meetings of the Association were under the forced administration of the British Armed Forces for several years. In 1854, two Catholics from the Archdiocese of Cologne travelled through the Holy Land, where they learned about the difficult living conditions of the Catholic Christians in Palestine and the run down state of the holy sites. Upon their return, they encouraged the establishing of the Association of the Holy GraveFriedrich Heyer: 2000 Years of Church History in the Holy Land: Martyrs, Monks, Fathers, Crusaders, Patriarchs, Excavators and Pilgrims, (German: 2000 Jahre Kirchengeschichte des heiligen Landes: M√§rtyrer, M√∂nche, Kirchenv√§ter, Kreuzfahrer, Patriarchen, Ausgr√§ber und Pilger) LIT Verlag M√ºnster 2000, P. 306, which aimed to support the Catholic Church and its institutions in the Holy Land. In 1885 it established ties with the Palestine Union of the German Catholics, which aimed to \\"strengthen the German Catholic ways in the holy land of Palestine\\". In 1895 both organisations merged into the German Association of the Holy Land. By then, the target group had extended to all oppressed Christians in the Ottoman Empire under the control of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Following the decisions reached at the Bishops‚Äô Conference at Fulda in 1896, donations were gathered for the victims of the Hamidian massacres.Johannes Lepsius, Armenien und Europa. Eine Anklageschrift, Verlag der Akademischen Buchhandlung W. Faber & Co, Berlin 1897, Online auf Wikisource Through the nation-wide interest in the Holy Land and the population's religious sense of mission, the German Association of the Holy Land attracted new members within the German Kingdom. As a result, the number of members increased to 30.000. The Association also constructed lavish buildings in Jerusalem, competing with other European nations and denominations doing the same. The impressive Abbey of the Dormition, which is owned by the Association, was built on a patch of land on Mount Zion gifted by Kaiser Wilhelm II. Afterwards, they began constructing a large hospice for the hundreds of pilgrims travelling to the Holy Land. The Association also supported a school for young European and Arab girls. However, its original plan of establishing Catholic settlers in economic colonies in Palestine failed, as they couldn‚Äôt find any volunteers. More hospices for pilgrims were raised on patches of land in Emmaus and Tabgha on the Sea of Galilee, which were cultivated with the help of local Bedouins. The work of the Association was made considerably more difficult by the two world wars and their consequences, such as the British occupation of Palestine in 1917. However, the Association successfully kept and still supports its institutions, located in present-day Israel and the Palestinian areas. Today, the German Association of the Holy Land acts as a charitable organization, supporting all Christians in the Middle East. It encourages understanding and reconciliation between religions and provides help to those in need. It also fosters social and pastoral projects in its historical buildings, supporting its partnering religious orders and communities. Nowadays, with its organised pilgrimages and its member magazine in German, The Holy Land, (German, Das Heilige Land) the German Association of the Holy Land continues to be a bridge between Germany and the Holy Land, as it has been for the last 160 years.  Mission  The main aims of the German Association of the Holy Land are the support of Christians in the Holy Land and assisting with pilgrimages to the Holy Land for German Christians. At the moment the Association maintains several pilgrim hospices and schools and supports these financially. Furthermore, it encourages a dialogue between the Christian and Jewish communities in the area. The Association also provides opportunities for voluntary work in its institutions. Paulus House, Jerusalem  Administration The president of the Association is the appointed Archbishop of Cologne, currently Rainer Maria Kardinal Woelki. The board makes its business decisions by voting with the administrative council which is supported by an advisory council. The assignments in the Holy Land are coordinated by the head office in Cologne. The German Association of the Holy Land and its interests are represented by a specific presiding priest in the diocese, chosen by the respective bishop.

The Ministry was first created in 1917 as the Ministry of Social Welfare (Ministerium f√ºr soziale F√ºrsorge). In its modern form, it dates back to the 1987 establishment of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (Ministerium f√ºr Arbeit und Soziales). From January 2018 to January 2020, the Ministry's official name was Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Health, and Consumer Protection (Bundesministerium f√ºr Arbeit, Soziales, Gesundheit und Konsumentenschutz). It is responsible for welfare, senior citizens affairs, health care, and consumer policy; it is also charged with stimulating job creation and fighting unemployment. In spite of its official designation, the Ministry is only rarely referred to as the Ministry of Labor (Arbeitsministerium). The moniker does see occasional use, but the traditional short form of Ministry of Social Affairs (Sozialministerium) clearly predominates.In a Presse archive search performed May 6, 2018, arbeitsministerium wien returned 108 while sozialministerium wien returned 1163. In a Standard archive search performed on the same day, arbeitsministerium wien returned 1 hit for the past month; an analogue search for sozialministerium wien returned 9. Presse and Standard are prestige broadsheets from opposite sides of the political spectrum.  History  The Ministry was first established in 1917 as the Ministry of Social Welfare (Ministerium f√ºr soziale F√ºrsorge). Created in the final days of World War I, a time of widespread hunger and destitution, it was concerned almost exclusively with pensions and benefits for subjects widowed, crippled, or impoverished by the conflict. After the war, it took control of Austria's developing system of social insurance. Gradually expanding, it existed in more or less its original form until 1987. Austria did not have a Ministry of Labor, or any other cabinet-level government agency with Labor in its name, for much of its existence. In the decade leading up to the Anschluss and to World War II, implacable hostility between Social Democrats and Christian Conservatives had eroded civil society, undermined democratic institutions, and sparked a civil war; the Christian Social Party eventually manufactured a constitutional crisis that allowed it to replace the Republic of Austria with the Federal State of Austria, a Fascist single-party state. In light of these experiences, Austrian politicians chose to reinvent the country as a consociationalist republic when Nazi Germany had collapsed and Austria, devastated and occupied by the victors, needed to be rebuilt. For the first few decades of postwar Austria, its new ethos of consensus decision making was an undisputed success, at least in terms of stability and prosperity. Social Democrats and Conservatism, while still intensely mistrustful of each other's motives and jealous of each other's influence, ruled the country through a series of constructive and mutually beneficial \\"grand coalition\\" cabinets. The Sozialpartnerschaft, a system of ritualized confrontation and conflict resolution between state-sponsored industrialists' lobbies and state-sponsored workers' unions, essentially dictated social policy to Parliament ‚àí while obviously questionable from a perspective of democratic purism, the system created rapid economic growth, near-full employment, and general social harmony all at the same time. It simply did not occur to either party that a dedicated Ministry of Labor should be necessary to protect workers' interests. When Franz Vranitzky did establish a Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (Bundesministerium f√ºr Arbeits und Soziales) in 1987 by extending and renaming the existing Ministry of Social Affairs, the move was a consequence of the decay of the postwar system. The Wirtschaftswunder years were over. Austria's nationalized heavy industries were in trouble. Some of the country's largest employers were in danger; the credibility of the Sozialpartnerschaft was suffering. At the same time, Austria's party landscape was changing: the combined vote share of Social Democrats and People's Party was declining; parliamentarism was becoming more vigorous and assertive. It was clear that future cabinets were going to have to take charge of employment policy and workers' welfare more directly and with more parliamentary accountability. In 1997, the Klima cabinet dissolved the Ministry of Health and Consumer Protection and transferred its responsibilities in matters of health care to what was now called the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs (Bundesministerium f√ºr Arbeit, Gesundheit und Soziales). The Chancellery was put in charge of consumer protection. A few years and one election later, in 2003, the Sch√ºssel I cabinet split the Ministry into three: Labor was attached to the Ministry of Economy. Social Affairs became a ministry in its own right again; Health became a standalone ministry as well. The new Ministry of Health was also in charge of family affairs; the Ministry of Social Affairs took back consumer protection from the Chancellery. A few years later, in 2009, responsibilities were shuffled again: the Faymann cabinet removed labor affairs from the Ministry of Economy, creating an independent Ministry of Labor once again; Labor then absorbed Social Affairs. In 2018, the Ministry also absorbed the Ministry of Health. On 29 January 2020, it was renamed Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection.  Responsibilities   Structure  As of May 2018, the ministry consists of the Minister and his personal staff (Kabinett), the office of the director general (Generalsekret√§r), and ten numbered regular departments (Sektionen): * Presidium, support, IT (Pr√§sidialangelegenheiten, Supportfunktionen, IT) * Social insurance (Sozialversicherung) * Consumer protection (Konsumentenschutz) * Nursing care insurance, disabilities matters, benefits policy (Pflegevorsorge, Behinderten-, Versorgungs- und Sozialhilfeangelegenheiten) * European and international policy outlook (Europ√§ische, internationale und sozialpolitische Grundsatzfragen) * Labor market (Arbeitsmarkt) * Employment law and employment law enforcement (Arbeitsrecht und Zentral-Arbeitsinspektorat) * Health care (Gesundheitssystem) * Patients' rights and health care consumer protection (Recht und Gesundheitlicher VerbraucherInnenschutz) * Public health and medical matters (√ñffentliche Gesundheit und medizinische Angelegenheiten) The Minister and his staff are political appointees; the director general and the section heads are career civil servants.

This was on the same day as other local elections in England.  Campaign  In February 2018, Peter Walker, a former Labour councillor for Figges Marsh who was suspended by the party in October 2017, claimed that the local Labour Party was excluding supporters of the national party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, from becoming councillors. Labour pledged to complete the building of a new leisure centre, bring AFC Wimbledon's home grounds within Merton, consider the introduction of a landlord licensing scheme, establish targets for affordable housing and introduce 20 mph zones. The Conservatives pledged to reintroduce weekly street cleaning, increase mobile CCTV, deliver a masterplan for Wimbledon, regenerate Morden, establish a 24/7 anti-social behaviour hotline, rebuild St Helier Hospital, introduce borough-wide anti-idling measures and reintroduce webcasting of council meetings. The Liberal Democrats pledged to institute a target of 50% affordable housing in large developments, install more public bins and public drinking fountains, increase cycling infrastructure, introduce default 20 mph zones, make Raynes Park and Motspur Park railway stations fully accessible, replace the closed walk-in surgery in Mitcham, introduce a levy on planning developments to pay for local schools, scrap charges for the use of Council-owned parks and playing fields, develop incubator sites for start-ups and establish neighbourhood plans. A key issue during the campaign was the proposed closure of Wimbledon police station by the Labour Mayor of London. The Conservatives proposed to buy the police station, while the Liberal Democrats supported a legal action against the closure. The legal action was brought by Paul Kohler, one of the successful Liberal Democrat candidates for Trinity in the election. = Demolition of Merton Hall = A key issue during the campaign was the partial demolition of the historic Merton Hall in South Wimbledon, which was given planning permission by the council in September 2017. Under the plans, the Elim Pentecostal Church would assume tenancy of Merton Hall after the year-long works, under the condition that the site could still be hired as a community space by local residents. Elim Church's current High Path site would then become a Harris Federation school hosting 1,200 students from September 2020. A petition opposing the plans and calling on Historic England to list Merton Hall attracted over 4,000 signatures. The plans attracted national attention in March 2018 over concerns that Elim Church could seek to prevent LGBT groups from hiring Merton Hall. The Conservatives opposed the demolition plans and pledged to end the demolition works immediately if elected; they also alleged that the demolition broke pre- election purdah rules, given that it was using public money on a contentious issue. The Merton Park Ward Residents Association also expressed their regret over the council's plans; their councillors suggested alternative sites for the secondary school and questioned the extent of the demolition required. The demolition works began in April 2018. In the election, the ward of Abbey, in which Merton Hall is situated, returned one Conservative councillor. After the election, responding to criticism of the plans, council leader Stephen Alambritis claimed that the council is building a brand new hall and not demolishing the existing one. Alambritis confirmed that two investigations were underway, one by the Local Government Ombudsman and another by Ernst and Young.  Results  Labour retained its control of Merton Council, its majority reduced to four seats. The Conservatives gained two seats from Labour (one each in the wards of Cannon Hill and Abbey) and the Liberal Democrats gained five seats from the Conservatives (two in West Barnes, two in Dundonald and one in Trinity). The Merton Park Ward Residents Association maintained its three councillors in Merton Park. By seat count, this was the best ever election result for the Liberal Democrats in the borough, and the first time they had held council positions outside the West Barnes ward. Paul Kohler, who achieved significant recognition after leading a legal campaign against the proposed closure of Wimbledon police station, was elected for the Liberal Democrats in Trinity. Two months after the election, his legal action resulted in a judgment that the decision to close the police station was unlawful. } On 11 May 2018, it was announced that the council's cabinet would be reshuffled. Mary Curtin, a Labour councillor for Lower Morden, was voted in as the council's new mayor at the Annual Council Meeting on 23 May 2018.

It was created on 1 April 2019 by the merger of the areas that were previously administered by the unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole, and the non-metropolitan district of Christchurch. The authority covers much of the area of the South Dorset conurbation. Background Districts of Dorset prior to the creation of BCP Bournemouth and Christchurch are historically part of the county of Hampshire, whilst Poole is historically a part of Dorset. By the mid 20th century the area had begun to coalesce as a conurbation, and in the 1974 Local Government Act, the three areas were brought together under the Ceremonial County of Dorset, whilst still forming separate districts. In 1997 Poole and Bournemouth became unitary authorities, whilst Christchurch remained within Dorset County Council. The new authority was formed as a result of local government reorganisation in the ceremonial county of Dorset. Under the plans, dubbed \\"Future Dorset\\", all councils within the county were abolished and replaced with two new unitary authorities. One was formed from the existing unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole, which merged with the non-metropolitan district of Christchurch to create the unitary authority to be known as Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. The other was created from the merger of the existing non-metropolitan districts of Weymouth and Portland, West Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck and East Dorset to form a new Dorset authority. Christchurch Borough Council formally opposed the plans, whilst every other existing authority in Dorset supported the plans. Christchurch Borough Council unsuccessfully challenged the proposals in the High Court. Several Conservative Councillors in Christchurch were suspended from the party for their opposition to the plan, with several of them subsequently standing as independents in the 2019 election. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council Statutory instruments for the creation of the new authority were made on behalf of the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on 25 May 2018, and a shadow authority was formed the following day. The Shadow Authority was composed of the existing borough councillors from Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, as well as the County Councillors representing Christchurch. The shadow authority had 125 members, and first met on 6th June 2018. However, in the Local Government Boundary Commission's review, they reduced the number of wards for the new authority to 33 multi- member wards, with 76 councillors in total. The first elections took place in 2019 alongside other local elections, and led to the Conservatives holding the most seats, but lacking a majority, meaning that the council remained under No overall control. Subsequent to the election, the Liberal Democrats, the second largest party in the council, led the creation of the Unity Alliance Administration, made up of the Liberal Democrats (15), Independents (11), Poole People (7), Labour (3), Green Party (2) and Alliance for Local Living (1). The Unity Alliance therefore had 39 members, the number required for a majority. The remaining councillors, belonging to the Conservative Party (36) and UKIP (1) remained in opposition. However, two Unity Alliance councillors died in 2020, and two Poole People councillors left both their party and the administration, leaving the administration in minority; a Vote of No Confidence in Council Leader Vikki Slade was subsequently passed, removing her as leader. A new leader is due to be elected on 1st October.  Geography  The authority lies in the South East of the ceremonial county of Dorset around 150 km from London. Dorset as a whole is part of the South West region of England, which is used for statistical purposes. The three former boroughs are all historically seaside towns with tourism playing an important part in the local economy. Bournemouth and Poole lie north of Poole Harbour, whilst Christchurch contains Christchurch Harbour, with the Isle of Wight and Solent to the East and English Channel to the South and West. = Climate = Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole has an Oceanic Temperate Climate. The presence of the Gulf Stream ensures that the British Isles maintain an all- year-round ambient temperature, and, because of its position on the south coast of England, the area has slightly warmer winters and cooler summers than settlements further inland. = Demographics = Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole The major settlements within Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole are Bournemouth, Poole, Christchurch and Merley / Oakley. Within the ceremonial county of Dorset, Bournemouth and Poole are the largest two settlements, whilst Christchurch is the fourth, after Weymouth. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole roughly overlaps with the South-East Dorset Conurbation, although the latter also spreads to the former East Dorset Borough and parts of the New Forest district of Hampshire. As such, the area lies within the South West Hampshire/South East Dorset Green Belt, created between 1958 and 1980, which regulates environmental and planning policy to manage development expansion.

She was a useful and consistent juvenile in 2017, winning three races including the Prestige Stakes and being placed on four of her other five starts. In the following spring she ran fourth on her seasonal debut and then recorded a 66/1 upset win in the 1000 Guineas. She failed to win again that year but returned to form in 2019 to win the Queen Charlotte Fillies' Stakes, Oak Tree Stakes and Sun Chariot Stakes. Background Billesdon Brook is a chestnut filly with a white blaze bred in England by Stowell Hill Partners. During her racing career she has carried the red and green colours of the Pall Mall Partners and has been trained by Richard Hannon Jr. at Everleigh in Wiltshire. She is from the fourth crop of foals sired by Champs Elysees whose wins included the Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes, Northern Dancer Turf Stakes and Canadian International Stakes. Before Billesdon Brook, the best-known of his progeny was the Ascot Gold Cup winner Trip To Paris. She is the second foal of Coplow, a mare who failed to win in eight races but made a promising start to her broodmare career by producing the Upavon Fillies' Stakes winner Billesdon Bess. She is a granddaughter of the Preis der Diana winner Anna Paola whose other descendants have included Annie Power, Helmet, National Defense (Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re), Annus Mirabilis (Mainichi Okan), Middle Club (Prix d'Aumale) and Piping Rock (Horris Hill Stakes). Geographically, Billesdon Brook is a stream in the Leicestershire village of Billesdon: Coplow Lane is 300 metres to the north. Racing career =2017: two-year-old season= Billesdon Brook began her racing career by finishing third in a maiden race over five furlongs at Salisbury Racecourse on 30 April. She finished second when favourite for her next two races, a novice stakes (for horses with no more than two wins) at Goodwood Racecourse in May and a similar event at Salisbury in June. On 5 July the filly started the 8/15 favourite for a novice stakes over seven furlongs on the Polytrack synthetic surface at Kempton Park. Ridden by Ryan Moore, she took the lead a furlong out and drew away to win by six lengths from Last Enchantment. The filly was moved up in class for the Listed Star Stakes at Sandown Park later that month and was partnered by Sean Levey, who had ridden her in her first two races. She took the lead two furlongs out but despite staying on well she was caught in the final strides and beaten a nose and a neck by Tajaanus and Capomento. A week later she was matched against male opposition and was assigned top weight of 129 pounds in a nursery (a handicap race for juveniles) at Goodwood. In a very rough race she was denied a clear run until the final furlong but then produced a strong finishing burst to win by a head from her stablemate Cheeky Rascal. The Prestige Stakes at Goodwood on 26 August saw Billesdon Brook stepped up to Group 3 class and start the 4/1 second favourite behind the John Gosden- trained Verandah. After being restrained by Levey in the early stages she began to make rapid progress in the last quarter mile, caught Whitefountainfairy 100 yards out and won by three-quarters of a length. After the race Richard Hannon said \\"I was very impressed. The fact she quickened past horses that were already quickening at the time was impressive. Ryan Moore said he thought when she gets to the front she does just enough and I think she did that there. Sean gave her a lovely ride and kept filling her up.\\" On her final appearance of the year she finished fifth in the Group 2 May Hill Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse but was only three and a half lengths behind the winner Laurens (later to take the Fillies' Mile). =2018: three- year-old season= On 18 April Billesdon Brook began her second season in the Nell Gwyn Stakes (a major trial race for the 1000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. She appeared to recover from a poor start but never looked likely to win and finished fourth behind the Godolphin filly Soliloquy. On 6 May Billesdon Brook started the 66/1 outsider in a fifteen-runner field for the 205th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile. Happily started favourite while the other fancied runners included Soliloquy, Laurens, Wild Illusion (Prix Marcel Boussac) and I Can Fly. Billesdon Brook raced towards the rear of the field before making a forward move approaching the last quarter mile. She passed at least ten horses in a matter of strides to take the lead a furlong out and won by one and three quarter lengths from Laurens with Happily taking third ahead of Wild Illusion. Her winning odds made her the longest-priced winner in the race's history, eclipsing Ferry's 50/1 success in 1918. Richard Hannon admitted that the filly was not the best fancied of his three runners in the race but insisted that there was \\"no fluke\\" about her victory while Levey said \\"She ran \\"gassy\\" in the Nell Gwyn. I thought she'd improve and that if everything fell into place for her she would be in the first four. But I was so happy at halfway and was counting down the horses I had left to pass at the two-furlong marker. I just hoped she would keep running, but she sailed all the way to the line\\". Levey, who is of Irish and Swazi parentage was described as the first black jockey to win a British Classic Race. At Royal Ascot in June Billesdon Brook started 9/2 second favourite for the Group 1 Coronation Stakes. After being retrained towards the rear of the field she stayed on steadily in the straight but never looked likely to win and came home fourth of the twelve runners behind Alpha Centauri. The filly was then stepped up in distance for the ten-furlong Nassau Stakes at Goodwood and finished fourth again, beaten three and a half lengths by the winner Wild Illusion. On her only other appearance that year, Billesdon Brook finished fifth to Laurens in the Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket in October. =2019: four-year-old season= On her first appearance as a four- year-old Billesdon Brook contested the Group 2 Dahlia Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket on 5 May and finished a well-beaten third behind Worth Waiting and Nyaleti in a five-runner field. Thirteen days later at Newbury Racecourse she was matched against male opposition in the Group 1 Lockinge Stakes and came home ninth behind the six-year-old gelding Mustashry at odds of 33/1. In June the filly was dropped in class and distance for the Listed Queen Charlotte Fillies' Stakes over seven furlongs on Polytrack at Chelmsford City Racecourse and started the 5/1 third choice in the betting behind Victory Wave and Solar Gold. After racing in mid-division she made progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead 100 yards from the finish and won by a length from Crossing The Line to record her first success for over a year. Three weeks after her win at Chelmsford Billesdon Brook attempted to follow up in the Pipalong Stakes over one mile at Pontefract Racecourse but after taking the lead 50 yards from the finish she was caught in the final strides by the 25/1 outsider Exhort and beaten three quarters of a length into second place. At Goodwood on 2 August the filly, with Levey in the saddle as usual, went off at odds of 12/1 for the Group 3 Oak Tree Stakes over seven furlongs. The three-year-old Jubiloso (third in the Coronation Stakes) started favourite in a seventeen-runner field which also included Angel's Hideaway (Princess Margaret Stakes), Royal Intervention (Summer Stakes) and Pretty Baby (winner of the race in 2018). Billesdon Brook was restrained towards the rear before producing a sustained run in the last quarter mile and gained the advantage in the closing stages and won by a neck and three quarters of a length from Perfection and Jubiloso. After the race Hannon said \\"she always turns up and runs her race every time... She has been a star for us. People slightly forgot her after she won the Guineas, but there was no fluke about that. She looked like a monster when she won her nursery here. She is just a really sweet filly.\\" On 5 October at Newmarket Billesdon Brook started a 16/1 outider as she made her second attempt to win the Sun Chariot Stakes. Laurens and Hermosa started joint-favourites while the other fancied runners were Iridessa, Lavender's Blue (Atalanta Stakes), Veracious (Falmouth Stakes) and I Can Fly. Billesdon Brook broke well but was hampered soon after the start and dropped back in the field as Laurens went to the front and set the pace. Levey had some trouble finding a clear run for Billesdon Brook in the last quarter mile but when the filly obtained room to race she produced a strong late run, overtook the leader Veracious well inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths. Hannon commented \\"Form may be temporary but class is permanent and you don't win a Guineas and be average. We've moved her from Herridge Stables to Everleigh and the change of scene has done her good. As well as that, her work rider Luke Catton has done a good job with settling her down. That was a good performance as there were plenty fancied in it, and Sean gave her a lovely waiting ride. I would like her to stay in training for the next 20 years.\\" For her final run of the season the filly was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf over ten furlongs at Santa Anita Park on 2 November. She was made the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting but never looked likely to win and finished eighth behind Iridessa. =2020: five- year-old season= Billesdon Brook began her five-year-old season in the Listed Snowdrop Fillies' Stakes over 1 mile on the Polytrack surface at Kempton Park on 3 June, leading inside the final furlong before finishing second by ¬æ lengths to Nazeef.

The RHYP administers the National Runaway Safeline, a 24 hour hotline for adolescents in crisis, which provides educational resources and technical assistance, and the National Clearinghouse on Runaway and Homeless Youth, founded in 1992, and which serves as a central repository for information related to runaway or homeless youth. The RHYP provides services to approximately 30,000 individuals through emergency shelters, and houses between 3,500 and 4,000 youths per year. the program was funded at a rate of $115 million annually. The program overall is divided into three major components: =The Basic Center Program= The Basic Center Program provides \\"intervention, temporary shelter, counselling, and after-care services\\" through a network of emergency shelters mostly housed in local non-profits or public health departments. Shelter is provided for youths for a period of up to 21 days, which includes individual and family counseling for a range of issues, which may include educational assistance, vocational training, job searching, and exit planning if needed, to make arrangements for after they depart the shelter. Annual funding for the 2015 fiscal year was $53 million, with 296 grantees. Of those served by the program in the 2014 fiscal year, 52% were female and 48% were male; 3% were under the age of 10, while 37% were age 11 to 14, and 60% were age 15 to 17; and finally 51% were white, while 32% were black and 20% were Hispanic or Latino. A total of 86% were living in a private residence prior to entry in the program, and 67% were attending school regularly. The same year, centers had to turn away 2,425 youths who contacted them for services due to lack of available space. Overall, 90% of those staying in Basic Centers transition to a stable living situation, and 70% return to the home of a parent or guardian. =The Transitional Living Program= The Transitional Living Program provides \\"long-term housing and supportive services\\" to those age 16 to 21. These may include life-skills building, interpersonal skills building, educational assistance, vocational assistance, behavioral health care and physical health care. Services are normally provided for a period of 540 days, although those who remain in the program for longer than 635 days may remain until they turn 18 years old. The annual funding for the 2015 fiscal year was $44 million, with 200 grantees. Of those served by the program in the 2014 fiscal year, 60% were female and 39% were male; 45% were white, 39% black, and 16% Hispanic or Latino; and finally, 4% were under the age of 16, while 40% were age 17 to 19, 46% were age 19 to 20, and 10% were over the age of 21. The same year the program was forced to turn away 4,842 youths who contacted them for services due to lack of space, including 801 who were placed on waiting lists. Overall, 88% of those leaving transitional living go on to find stable housing, 38% had attained a high school diploma or GED, and 27% were employed while 46% were seeking employment. =Street Outreach Program= The Street Outreach Program (also known as the Education and Prevention Services to Reduce Sexual Abuse of Runaway, Homeless, and Street Youth Program) provides \\"education, treatment, counselling and referrals\\" for teenage runaways, homeless teenagers, and others living on the streets. Annual funding for the 2015 fiscal year was $17 million, with 101 grantees served. Although workers to not gather personal information on those served, the program recorded a total of 461,524 instances of contact with young people in the 2014 fiscal year, of which 21,378 moved to a shelter for at least a single night. Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program The Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program supports efforts at reducing rates of teen pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, with an emphasis on adolescents in foster care, those who are homeless, and those who belong to minority groups. Grant programs include: * The State Personal Responsibility Education Program, which began in 2010 through an amendment to the Social Security Act, and which in the fiscal year for 2016 dispersed $40.8 million among 50 grantees. * The Tribal Personal Responsibility Education Program, which in 2016 dispersed $3.4 million among eight grantees * The Personal Responsibility Education Program Competitive Grants, which in 2015 awarded $10 million to 21 grantees * The Personal Responsibility Education Innovative Strategies Program, which awards about $9 million annually * The State Abstinence Education Grant Program, which supports abstinence education, and in the fiscal year for 2016 awarded $60.4 million to 38 states and territories * The Competitive Abstinence Education Grant Program, which funds initiatives that increase \\"knowledge of effective and promising approaches to reducing teen pregnancy\\" Family Violence Prevention and Services Program The Family Violence Prevention and Services Program (FVPSP) provides a number of grants to targeted as domestic violence victims along with their families, provides funding for approximately 1,600 emergency shelters, as well as counseling, and a national domestic violence hotline. The FVPSP also provides funding for research into the prevention of family violence, training, and technical assistance to related programs. Program funding is allocated as follows: * 70% to states and territories for domestic violence programs * 10% to tribes for domestic violence programs * 10% to Domestic Violence Coalitions * 6% to the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence * 2.5% for evaluation, monitoring and administration * 1.5% for discretionary spending See also * Foster care in the United States * Homelessness in the United States References External links  Family and Youth Services Bureau Fact Sheet from the National Clearinghouse on Families & Youth Category:Administration for Children and Families programs ","title":"Family and Youth Services Bureau"},{"id":"57358310","title":"Money in the Bank (2019)"},{"id":"57358313","text":"Fabiana Mollica (born 25 December 1983) is an Italian bobsledder.

He was a close associate of Ferdinand Marcos, and is noted not to be embarrassed by \\"his much-criticized close association with Marcos and his being tagged as a crony.\\"  Early life and education  Rodolfo Cuenca was born on May 1, 1928, at the Philippine General Hospital, to Nicolas and Cristina Cuenca. He is the eldest among four children. Cuenca spent his early years in Vigan, as his father was assigned district engineer in Ilocos Sur. In 1937, the family transferred to Bulacan, where Cuenca finished his fourth and fifth grade. He continued sixth grade in Ateneo de Manila on Padre Faura, then transferred to the Intramuros campus for his seventh grade. During the Second World War, Cuenca withdrew from high school and worked some jobs, one of which was at the General Engineering Depot for the US Army in Malolos. In 1946, he returned to Ateneo to finish high school. He then enrolled in Far Eastern University to study commerce, but soon dropped out to work as a road contractor. On 2 January 1948, he married Yasmin Santos, whom Cuenca met in Angat, Bulacan.  Association with Ferdinand Marcos  Cuenca financially donated to Ferdinand Marcos' first presidential campaign in 1965. In his second year of presidency, Marcos awarded large-scale projects to Cuenca's company, Cuenca Construction Company, which later became part of the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP). Under the Republic Act (RA) 3741, private contractors were allowed to bid for government infrastructure projects. In 1967, CDCP won government contracts to build the Manila North and South Expressways, valued in just over $16 million. The company maintained its favored treatment until the early 80s, for the benefit Cuenca and Marcos, both of whom divided and funneled commissions and kickbacks into their own pockets. According to Cuenca, it was in also in 1967 when he started joining Marcos to play golf, along with Robert \\"Bobby\\" Benedicto, the latter's classmate in UP Law School, and the former's close friend since the 1950s. These frequent golf sessions would continue well into the Martial Law era. For Marcos' re-election campaign in 1969, Cuenca again played the role of fundraiser.  Tenure as Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) Chairman  Cuenca's chairmanship of Construction & Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) began in 1967, and lasted until 1983. It was during this period that Cuenca acquired much of his wealth, properties, and companies. Between these years, CDCP experienced a rapid rise of profits, mainly through what critics called \\"bloated\\" government contracts. These profits then suddenly plummeted, due to accumulation of government debts and unnecessary expenses. = CDCP Projects = Cuenca's company was involved with many projects, which were constructed at the behest of Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda Marcos. These included the Manila North and South Luzon Expressways, the San Juanico Bridge, Imelda Marcos' Manila Bay Reclamation Project, and the Light Rail Transit (LRT). Manila North and South Luzon Expressways The first major government contract CDCP was awarded were for the construction of Manila North and South Luzon Expressways. By the end of 1968, the first phase of the Manila North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) was open to the public, the road measuring 28 kilometers towards Guiginto Bulacan from Balintawak. In the same year of 1968, construction for the Manila South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) began. The initial 16-kilometer stretch from Nichols to Alabang was finished by 1970. These contracts also allowed CDCP to gain back their expenditures and/or capital by collecting toll fees for a decade, \\"starting from 1968 or until it accumulated $6.1 million, whichever came first.\\" CDCP, however, requested that the duration be extended, as well the amount increased, justifying that their cost of operations had also inflated, and that they were held responsible \\"not only to maintain the highways but also to improve and 'expand' them.\\" Although a TRB report showed evidence that CDCP has amassed $25.6 million already in one year alone from 1976‚Äì77, TRB approved their request and extended the duration to thirty years. Presidential Decrees (PD) 1112 and 1113 in 1977 also imposed an increase in toll rates, forcing the public to pay steep fees that would primarily benefit CDCP and Cuenca's pocket. During a 1975 toll hike, buses boycotted the NLEX and SLEX roads. The Marcos administration retaliated by releasing a PD that closed service roads for buses, which then had no choice to pass through the expressways.  San Juanico Bridge  In 1974, the Marcos administration and the CDCP tapped Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) loans to build the San Juanico Bridge, which crossed the San Juanico Strait and connected the two then-underdeveloped islands of Leyte and Samar. With a total length of , it remains the longest bridge spanning a body of seawater in the Philippines. It was touted as President Ferdinand Marcos' \\"birthday gift\\" to his wife Imelda,and it was one of the high-visibility foreign-loan projects initiated by Marcos during the run-up to the 1969 Presidential election campaign. Completed four years later, it was inaugurated on July 2, 1973 - Imelda Marcos' birthday. Upon its completion, economists and public works engineers tagged it as a \\"white elephant\\" which was \\"constructed several decades too soon\\", because its average daily traffic (ADT) was too low to justify the cost of its construction. As a result, its construction has been associated with what has been called the Marcoses' \\"edifice complex\\". In the decades after the Marcoses administration, economic activity in Samar and Leyte has finally caught up with the bridge's intended function, and it has become an iconic tourist attraction acknowledged as \\"part of the identity of people in Samar and Leyte.\\"  Manila Bay Reclamation  CDCP, again at Imelda's behest sought out a land reclamation project in Manila Bay. They were to construct an artificial 240-hectare white beach behind the Cultural Center of the Philippines. The rationale of the project was to create a 'Cannes' vibe for the international visitors of the Manila Film Festival. The white sand was quarried from the cities of Mariveles and Cavite. This area is now known to be the Manila Bay Free port Zone. Also at Imelda's command, CDCP and other companies worked to create a \\"huge complex of native-style pavilions\\" for representatives of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in their 1979 conference in Manila. The complex became a ghost town throughout the 1980s.  Light Rail Transit  Another project of the CDCP was the Light Rail Transit (LRT), this time partly financed by a $40 million loan from the Belgian government. A study of the World Bank in 1977 challenged the intentions of the project, stating that Manila needed a street-level transport system, not a 'high-flyer'. A street-level transport system would also cost much cheaper, with only a $8.1 million estimate, compared to the $278 million over-all cost for the LRT. Despite these skepticism, Marcos permitted Cuenca to begin construction in October 1981.  Other projects  Other projects the CDCP under Cuenca handled were the Pantabangan Dam, and the Candaba Viaduct.  Turnover of Chairmanship to Roberto Ongpin  Cuenca eventually invited Roberto Ongpin to take his place as CDCP chairman, although Cuenca kept his position as president, and \\"7% ownership\\" of the firm.  1987 PCGG Case  On July 24, 1987, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) filed a case whose respondents included Cuenca and his son Roberto, Imelda Marcos, Roberto Ongpin, former Philippine National Bank president Panfilo O. Domingo, Development Bank of the Philippines officer Don Ferry, and eleven others, claiming that the respondents had engaged in ‚Äúschemes, devices or stratagems‚Äù to acquire ill-gotten wealth. On August 5, 2010, the Sandiganbayan dismissed the case after throwing out 60 of the 100 documentary exhibits presented by the PCGG at the trial because they were photocopies, rather than original copies of the documents. The 27-page decision penned by Sandiganbayan Associate Justice Alex L. Quiroz, asserted that ‚Äúsince the due execution and authenticity of said photocopied documents had not been proved, the same were inadmissible in evidence. Further, the documents in question were rendered inadmissible as they were only photocopies.‚Äù In June 2018, the Philippine Supreme Court‚Äôs First Division dismissed the complaint of the PCGG against the 2010 Sandiganbayan ruling, stating that the Supreme Court was not able to review the evidence in order to rule on the PCGG‚Äôs complaint. The 28-page decision penned by Supreme Court Associate Justice Noel Tijam said that: \\"In order to determine the veracity of the Republic's main contention that it has established a prima facie case against respondents through its documentary and testimonial evidence, a reassessment and reexamination of the evidence is necessary[‚Ä¶.] Unfortunately, the limited and discretionary judicial review allowed under Rule 45 does not envision a re-evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence upon which respondent court's action was predicated. \\" The PCGG released a press statement reacting to the decision, saying \\"Although the complaint was filed by the PCGG more than 31 years ago, and the Supreme Court decision was a mere affirmation of the Sandiganbayan ruling 8 years ago, the present officials of PCGG will still exhaust all possible legal remedies to pursue the case and to protect government interest.‚Äù  2010 biography  In the 2000s, Cuenca sought out authors Jose Dalisay Jr. and Antonette Reyes to write his biography, which was eventually published in September 2010 under the title \\"Builder of Bridges: the Rudy Cuenca Story\\". Journalist Amando Doronila, who had himself been one of the first critics arrested when Marcos proclaimed martial law in 1972, noted that \\"the book is the first time a Marcos crony or a senior functionary has written about his role in the Marcos hierarchy,\\" adding that in the book, \\"Rodolfo Cuenca who admits to being a Marcos crony, reveals for the first time an insider‚Äôs view of the heightening rivalry among power blocs within the Marcos inner circle as the dictator‚Äôs health started to deteriorate in 1983... The book reveals the corruption and the corrosive tensions among the Marcos‚Äô Palace elite that contributed to its downfall during the last three years of the dictatorship.\\"  See also  * Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos * Ferdinand Marcos  References  Category:1928 births Category:Filipino businesspeople Category:Marcos Administration personnel Category:Living people ","title":"Rodolfo Cuenca"},{"id":"57358433","text":"Arabian Ranches is a gated villa community in Dubai, United Arab Emirates launched in 2004.

In the late 1960s, Mexico experienced an intense conflict of ideologies between state officials and university students. In the spirit of left wing politics and democracy, students organized and protested in order to promote social change. When the state responded by coordinating a military assault that ended up killing hundreds of unarmed students, students resorted to super 8 mm film to express their grievances with the state and to rebel by creating films uncensored by the state. This group of mostly male college students identified as the superocheros, adopting the name of the type of film with which they shot films.  History  This social movement lead by the radical youth became popular and eventually gained the attention of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Because of the youth counterculture‚Äôs rapid spreading influence, President Diaz Ordaz ordered for the formation of a special military unit designed specifically to infiltrate and disrupt student protests. This military unit was named Los Halcones (The Falcons) and commanded by President Ordaz Diaz‚Äô Interior Secretary, Luis Echeverria. On October 2nd, 1968, Echeverria coordinated a military level strike on unarmed student protestors gathered in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco section of Mexico City. Hundreds of university students were murdered by this assault and it became known as the Tlatelolco Massacre. Soon after this attack, frustrated students and activists poured their time and energy into shooting super 8mm films. The young radicals used filmmaking as a tool to express their dissatisfaction with the state and to reflect their harsh lived realities. These young organizers referred to their collective mentality for political and social change as ‚ÄúLa Onda‚Äù. This spirit of criticizing the state through the medium of 8mm film worked to establish an identity for young artists. The superocheros created films that defied any traditional sense of Mexican national cinema and in their attempt to specifically oppose Golden age Mexican Cinema, the superocheros heavily borrowed influence from European new-wave cinema and also adopted the ideology of the auteur. The Superocheros created critical and conceptual low budget films that were privately exhibited in underground bars, coffee shops and social hangouts. The independent film counterculture is officially stated to have begun with a festival style exhibition in 1970. The socially conscious ideologies set forth by La Onda combined with the ambitious actions of the superocheros eventually manifested into what can be considered the earliest version of Independent Cinema in Mexico.  State Funded Films  Yet, state policies changed when Gustavo Diaz Ordaz left office and Luis Echeverria succeeded him as President. While in office, Echeverria implemented an initiative to recreate the notion of Mexican National Cinema altogether by using state funding as means to finance films with the intention of creating a new high quality national cinema. Ironically, the individual responsible for the murder of hundreds of unarmed students just two years before was Echeverr√≠a himself. Echeverria‚Äôs brother and former actor Rodolfo Landa Echeverria, was appointed the head of the new national cinema initiative and was responsible for funding projects that would make Mexican National cinema respectable, as it was during the days of Golden Age Mexican Cinema. Although the goal of rebuilding a national cinema was intended to reflect Mexico as a progressive society, many of the state policies remained unchanged and the same political ideals implemented by Diaz Ordaz remained intact under Echeverria. In fact, many films funded during Echeverria‚Äôs presidency specifically attempted to mock youth counterculture. Despite Echeverria‚Äôs efforts to make a mockery of youth counterculture, it was during his time in office that a number of independent filmmakers would emerge and advance from directing films as a part of the underground counterculture to directing state funded big-budget projects. As Cazals proved to be a standout talent, he was granted funding for a number of films during Echeverria‚Äôs sexenio including Las Poquianchis, The Heist, Zapata, and eventually his most critically acclaimed and controversial film Canoa: A Shameful Memory.Hegarty, Kerry, et al. ‚ÄúYouth Culture on Film: an Analysis of Post-1968 Mexican Cinema.‚Äù Studies in Hispanic Cinemas, iv, no. 3, 2007, pp. 165‚Äì182.  The Declaration of Independence - 8 Millimeter vs 8 Million  While directors such as Cazals, Ripstein and others experienced commercial success as well as critical acclaim for their state funded films, the superocheros became vocal about their grievances with the director‚Äôs claims of being independent filmmakers. In 1972, the superocheros created a document titled 8mm vs 8million, which was a declaration of independence that directly called out Felipe Cazals and others as they believed that the directors were violating the term ‚Äúindependent‚Äù when they used it to categorize their work. This document not only expresses a clear disdain for state censored filmmaking, but functions as a clear guide to understanding how the counterculture ideologies of the time defined the term, independent. According to the document, in order to be considered independent, a filmmaker must abide to the specific rules and ideologies laid out in the manifesto. Signed by forty-eight filmmakers, this manifesto serves as documented evidence that the term independent was once determined with concrete requirements in Mexico. This document would later prove to lose its conviction as Felipe Cazals demonstrated the ways in which state funded films could incorporate the major ideals of independence laid out in the manifesto even if the film did not meet certain requirements. Things would also change for the underground counterculture as commercial filmmaking began to attract superochero filmmakers, driving them away from the counterculture and into the mainstream.Cazals, Felipe, et al. ‚ÄúManifesto: 8 Millimeters Versus 8 Millions.‚Äù Wide Angle, vol. 21, no. 3, 1999, pp. 36‚Äì41.

Popularly known as \\"The Argentine Vampire\\" and \\"The Window Vampire\\", referencing his modus operandi.  Background  Florencio Fern√°ndez was mentally ill, suffering from delusions and hallucinations that made him firmly believe that he was a vampire (he was possibly schizophrenic), in addition to having a sexual attraction to blood. From a young age he began living in the streets because his family abandoned him. At the time of his arrest, he was living in a cave adjacent to the community, suffering from photophobia.  Modus operandi  He stalked his victim for several days, made sure she was alone at home, and taking advantage of the hot spring or summer nights, when residents left their windows open during the night, he entered the house through them. While his victim slept, Fern√°ndez beat her. Then, he would bite the body, sometimes reaching to dissect the trachea and the carotid, and thus mirrored the stereotype of that he drank the blood of his victims. Then, he left the victim to bleed to death, if they hadn't died already.  Apprehension, imprisonment and death  Florencio was arrested on February 14, 1960 at the age of 25; in the police investigation, which the press described as \\"picturesque\\", since it took the cave where the murderer lived. Fern√°ndez did not resist the arrest, until the police made him leave the cave into the sunlight. He was declared insane and confined in a psychiatric institution, where he died of natural causes a few years later.

He is currently a Senior Advisor for Donald Trump's 2020 Presidential Re-Election Campaign. He was also the campaign's Ohio state director in 2016. Career Paduchik started his professional career at Ohio Department of Transportation during the tenure of Governor George Voinovich. In 1994, Paduchik was the coordinator for Northeast Ohio during the senate campaign of Mike DeWine and then served on the Senator‚Äôs staff. He became political director in Bob Taft‚Äôs campaign to become Governor of Ohio in 1998. After the successful campaign, he was appointed Director of Constituent Affairs responsible for Minority, Veterans and Cultural affairs. In the year 2000, he was executive director of the Bush- Cheney campaign in Ohio, on leave from his usual job as political director of Ohio's governor Taft. After the election, Paduchik was a member of the Department of Defense Transition Team and was later appointed by George W. Bush as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Intergovernmental Affairs at the U.S. Department of Energy. He served in this capacity between October 2001 and January 2003. During this time, he was a driving force in the so-called Yucca Mountain Project. Paduchik afterwards founded his own company, Agincourt Consultants, in the Columbus, Ohio area. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to run Bush's reelection efforts in Ohio in 2004 and succeeded through a grassroots campaign which included the help of about 85,000 volunteers to motivate up to 175,000 new voters, most of whom where presumably Republican, to cast their votes. He then again moved to the private sector, where he became Vice-President of Client Services at the public affairs firm DCI Group before joining Rob Portman's team, a former Congressman from Cincinnati, who ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate in February 2009. In February 2011, Paduchik became Senior Vice President, State Affairs and Outreach for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE). When the Trump campaign gained traction after the candidate's success in the primaries in 2016, it was in need of an experienced leader for the key state of Ohio. They asked Paduchik who became campaign manager and was later described as \\"the architect of President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs wildly successful campaign in Ohio\\". This success was considered to be even more notable for the fact that the Republican's campaign started more than four weeks later than Hillary Clinton's and only had a relatively small staff. Another burden the campaign had to overcome was a certain opposition by Ohio GOP leaders against candidate Trump, which in fact kept on until late in the campaign and led to a public exchange between Paduchik and Matt Borges, GOP's chairman in Ohio in October 2016. In December 2016, however, Borges announced in an interview, his support for Bob Paduchik's upcoming election as deputy chairman of the RNC. In December 2016, President-elect Donald Trump announced Paduchik as next RNC Deputy Co-Chairman, poised to become Co-chairman of the RNC in 2017. Indeed, Paduchik‚Äôs as well as his superior Ronna McDaniel‚Äôs election by the Republican National Committee which took place on January 2017 were unanimous. In February 2018, Trump praised Paduchik during an RNC dinner for his handling of the campaign in the swing state of Ohio. Education Paduchik earned a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Akron ('89) and an honorary certificate in applied politics from the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics. Private life Paduchik lives in Genoa Township in Ohio with his wife and two daughters. The native of Tallmadge, Ohio is a member of the St. Gregory of Nyssa Orthodox Church. He is a member of the board of the Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio Foundation as well as a certified coach for the U.S. Soccer Federation.

The Commission was created in March 2016 by the Evidence-Based Policymaking Commission Act (P.L. 114-140), legislation jointly filed by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA). Over the subsequent 18 months after the law's enactment, the Commission engaged in fact-finding and deliberations that involved consideration of evidence from a survey of more than 200 federal agencies, testimony from more than 50 individuals, and additional written comments from 350 individuals. The commission also received feedback from President Barack Obama's administration. On September 7, 2017, the Commission issued its final report, \\"The Promise of Evidence-Based Policymaking\\" which outlined a vision for \\"a future in which rigorous evidence is created efficiently, as a routine part of government operations, and used to construct effective public policy.\\" The final report includes findings and 22 recommendations for the President and Congress that were unanimously agreed to by the members of the Commission. The Commission outlined three overarching themes about improving access to data, strengthening privacy protections, and ensuring the capacity to generate and use evidence is present in government. In line with each of the three themes, the commission's recommendations include strategies for modifying federal laws affecting data use, establishing a National Secure Data Service to engage in data linkage activities, instituting processes to improve data access and transparency, and designating leadership positions to support evidence generation and use in government.  Implementing the Commission Recommendations  On September 28, 2017, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the U.S. House of Representatives heard testimony from four commissioners: Chair Katharine G. Abraham, Co-Chair Ron Haskins, Commissioner Robert Shea, and Commissioner Latanya Sweeney. = Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (Evidence Act) = In October 2017, Speaker Ryan and Senator Murray jointly filed the Foundations for Evidence- Based Policymaking Act, intended to implement half of the Commission's recommendations. The House bill was marked up by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on November 2, 2017, and voted out of the House under suspension on November 15, 2017. While waiting for Senate action on the legislation, in 2018, the administration of President Donald Trump indicated its support for the commission's vision and indicated steps that were being taken to implement some of the Commission recommendations. In September 2018, the Bipartisan Policy Center hosted a one-year anniversary event called \\"Evidence: A Time to Act\\" that featured keynote remarks from Margaret Weichert, the deputy director for management at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. In conjunction with the event, the co-chairs of the commission called on Congress to advance legislation implementing their recommendations. In December 2018, the Senate passed a modified version of the legislation and the House of Representatives subsequently concurred in the amendments. On January 14, 2019, President Donald Trump signed the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (\\"Evidence Act\\") into law as Public Law 115-435. The new law was described as the most comprehensive data reforms in a generation and an \\"enormous step\\" for evidence-based policymaking. The Evidence Act takes steps to promote data accessibility and enable responsible data use, including by creating chief data officers, evaluation officers, and statistics officials at agencies across the federal government. = Federal Data Strategy = On June 4, 2019, the White House Office of Management and Budget issued the Federal Data Strategy, outlining a set of principles and practices federal agencies are expected to adhere to over the next decade. The Federal Data Strategy is considered one of the implementation vehicles for the Evidence Act and the Evidence Commission's recommendations. An earlier draft version of the strategy received extensive public comments from federal agencies and non-governmental organizations like the Data Coalition and the Bipartisan Policy Center. In June 2019, the Trump Administration also released a draft action plan, describing a set of 16 actions agencies are expected to undertake in 2019-2020. The plan was referred to by one expert as \\"a promising start to recognizing government data as a strategic asset.\\" A public forum was held on July 8, 2019, co-hosted by the White House's Office of Management and Budget and the Data Coalition, to solicit additional feedback on the draft action plan from more than 50 commenters. A final action plan is expected in fall 2019.  Two-Year Progress Report  On September 7, 2019, the Data Coalition issued a two-year update summarizing the achievements made in law and policy for addressing the Commission's recommendations, indicating \\"substantial progress\\" had been made on the recommendations. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan is anticipated to describe next steps in addressing the Commission's recommendations during keynote remarks at the Data Coalition's GovDATAx Summit on October 30, 2019.

Definition of homeless youth The RYHA forms the basis of the federal government's definition of homeless youth, as a person who is: > not more than 21 years of age ... for whom it is not possible to live in a > safe environment with a relative and who have no other safe alternative > living arrangement. Runaway and Homeless Youth Program It provides federal funding in the amount of $115 million per year as of 2014, for emergency shelters and other services throughout the country targeted at young adults and adolescents who have run away or are homeless. This funding forms the basis of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau of the Department of Health and Human Services. The program provides services in three areas: the Basic Centre Programme, the Transitional Living Programme, and the Street Outreach Programme.

Inspired by millenarian ideas, the movement launched several uprisings against the late Qing Empire, the Republic of China, and the Chinese puppet states of Japan. The Yellow Sands were eventually suppressed by the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the second half of the 20th century.  History  = Origins = Similar to other secret societies in China, the exact origins and operations of the Yellow Sand Society are difficult to discern. Chinese secret societies occasionally changed names, and were highly decentralized, with several differently named branches operating as part of the same movement. Sometimes, completely unrelated groups also shared the same name. It is thus difficult to clearly differentiate between the secret societies. The Yellow Sands are known to have operated as \\"Yellow Way Society\\" for part of their existence and have also been equated with the \\"Yellow Gate Society\\", which was active in Jinan, Shandong. In turn, \\"Yellow Gate Society\\" served as an alternative name for the Yellow Spears, a sub-group of the Red Spear Society. Consequently, the Yellow Sands have been characterized both as offshoot and predecessor of the Red Spear Society. It has also been theorized that the Yellow Sand Society was connected to the White Lotus movement. The Yellow Sands were already active in the late Qing Empire, having possibly emerged as rural self-defense movement in reaction to the gradual decline of the Chinese government and the subsequent rise of banditry and chaos. By the late 19th century, they flourished in the isolated Guan County, Shandong, at the border to Henan. The Yellow Sand Society would continue to be most active in the border area of Henan, Shandong, and Hebei for the rest of its existence. In 1908, peasants in eastern Henan banded together and organized themselves as the \\"Yellow Way Society\\" in opposition to the Qing government. Three years later, these peasants started an open rebellion in an attempt to support the Xinhai Revolution. They captured and plundered Taikang. They were defeated thereafter, with about 1,000 Yellow Way insurgents killed. = Republican China = Ming Emperor of China (pictured: Chongzhen Emperor, the last recognized Ming ruler) Following the collapse of the Qing Empire, the Yellow Way Society opposed the new Republican government. This was unusual, for most secret societies chose to cooperate with the new regime until the mid-1920s. Around 1919, a man calling himself \\"Chu the Ninth\\" appeared in Anyang County of northern Henan. Claiming to be the ninth-generation descendant of the Ming dynasty, he proclaimed himself Emperor of China with the era name \\"Great Brightness\\" (Daming). In doing so, Chu was supported by a local Yellow Way teacher. The two jointly declared that China had to be reunified under the \\"true dragon [rightful emperor]\\" and that only Yellow Way Society members would be spared in the coming armageddon; their insurgency against the government lasted three years and was finally suppressed by Republican militia and army forces. Thereafter the movement resumed to call itself the Yellow Sand Society and continued to organize rural communities to resist increasing taxation and government intrusion for the rest of the Warlord Era. In course of the Kuomintang (KMT)'s Northern Expedition 1926‚Äì28, the power of the warlords in northern China weakened significantly. This prompted the Yellow Sands, alongside other rural groups like the Red Spears and Heavenly Gates, to seize large areas for themselves. For example, these three secret societies captured Cheng'an County in 1927 and proceeded to run the local government for several months. Although the secret societies were thus fighting the same enemies as the KMT, the latter regarded this development unfavorably. This was due to the KMT-led Nationalist government fearing that the Yellow Sands and other rural groups would hinder their own tax collections just as they had resisted the warlords' taxation. The 1936 rebellion of Yellow Sands in Miyun District was crushed by the Imperial Japanese Army (pictured: Japanese soldiers in 1937) The Yellow Sand Society also took part in the Chinese resistance against the Empire of Japan, which increasingly occupied Chinese territory in the 1930s. One branch of the movement was reorganized by its leader Chang Yin-tang into the \\"People's Anti- Japanese National Salvation Self-Defence Corps\\", based at Taocheng in southern Hebei. Another Yellow Sand faction launched an uprising against the East Hebei Autonomous Council, a puppet state of Japan, in July 1936. Led by an old Taoist priest, the Yellow Sands managed to defeat an East Hopei Army unit that was sent to suppress them in Miyun District, whereupon the Imperial Japanese Army mobilized to crush the uprising. By September, the Yellow Sand forces in Miyun had been defeated by the Japanese, with about 300 rebels killed or wounded in battle. As peasant organization, the Yellow Sand Society was among the secret societies that also attracted the Communist Party of China (CPC)'s attention. In December 1942, CPC leader Li Ta-chang released a paper which detailed how Communist cadres should deal with rural secret societies, grouping them into three categories. The Yellow Sands were considered to be a \\"feudal organization\\" led by landlords, but also important potential allies in the war against the Japanese. Li argued that Communists should join the secret societies and covertly indoctrinate them, and only attack those groups that adamantly refused to adopt Communism. Over time, however, the Communists became increasingly frustrated with the secret societies' political conservatism and refusal to adopt Communist ideas, so that the CPC increasingly shifted from cooperating with the rural groups to undermining and dismantling them. = Suppression by the Communist Party = With the CPC's victory in the Chinese Civil War and the People's Republic of China's establishment in 1949, the secret societies were seen as a political threat. As result, the CPC started to purge Mainland China of them, violently curtailing their activities. The Yellow Sand Society was consequently suppressed as seditious \\"sect\\". Nevertheless, remnants of the movement remained active as late as 1980, when three peasants were arrested as purported Yellow Sands. They were accused of having planned a rebellion and the reestablishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and reportedly resisted arrest. In the ensuing altercation, eight policemen were injured before the purported Yellow Sands were taken into custody. All were sentenced to unknown terms of imprisonment.  Beliefs  The Yellow Sand Society, like many other Chinese secret societies, was inspired in its activities by millenarian, spiritual and romanticised monarchist ideas. Its members believed that they could become immune to gunfire through \\"magic and incantations\\", a belief that was widely shared among secret societies. Historian Elizabeth J. Perry noted that this conviction of invulnerability was \\"a powerful weapon for bolstering the resolve of people who possessed few alternative resources with which to defend their meager holdings\\". The Yellow Sands also aimed at the restoration of the Ming dynasty. This too was a common motive among Chinese secret societies, often expressed in the slogan \\"Oppose the Qing; restore the Ming\\". This slogan remained popular in rural areas even after the Qing dynasty's fall and was still widely used in the 1940s. The rule of the Ming dynasty represented an idealized time, and it was widely believed that a Ming restoration would result in a \\"reign of happiness and justice for all\\" under a \\"good sovereign\\".

(2005), the genus is placed as the only member of the tribe Eupalini. However, the name \\"Eupalini\\" was not explicitly indicated as new, so it is currently considered an unavailable name according to the ICZN. In the sixth volume of the Catalogue of Palaearctic Coleoptera and in Bouchard et al. (2011), the genus is placed as incertae sedis within Eumolpinae instead. Eupales is recognised by some authors as a primitive member of Eumolpinae, and it shares some features with the Spilopyrinae. The genus was originally known as Pales, named by Chevrolat in Dejean's catalogue in 1836, but this was preoccupied by the fly genus Pales Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830. The replacement name \\"Eupales\\" was created by √âdouard Lef√®vre in 1885. Floricola is an older available name for the genus, created by Gistel in 1848; however, almost all authors have used Eupales in the last 125 years. An application to ICZN was sent in 2009 to conserve both the names Eupales and Eupalini, but the case was never published.

Konsthall roughly translates to \\"Art Gallery\\" however the organization is much more similar to a German Kunsthalle. R√∂da Sten Konsthall is an exhibition space for a diverse range of cultural events and art exhibitions, is home to Gothenburg's only legal graffiti wall \\"Draken\\"https://www.rodasten.com/index.php/sv/om/draken Draken and hosts a rich program of educational activities for all ages.

History R√∂da Sten Konsthall was originally built in 1940 as an old boiler house that supplied the industries of with heat. It was then used as a warehouse for hazardous waste, abandoned and stood empty for many years. The building, owned by the city of Gothenburg, was set to be demolished as it was seen as a \\"festering sore\\" on the city, because it was home to intense rave parties and covered in graffiti. This was the place that inspired Kulturprojekt R√∂da Sten. R√∂da Sten Konsthall and Gothenburg's only legal graffiti wall \\"Draken\\". Bob Kelly, a businessman and entrepreneur, had seen how people in the USA and England were renovating and re-purposing old factory buildings into spaces for cultural and artistic activities. He believed the boiler house had the potential to become a similar project. Kelly contacted Per H√•ll√©n, who at the time was a district committee representative of the Left Party for the Majorna district of Gothenburg, and who from January 1992 was also a member of the Gothenburg City Council. Kelly and H√•ll√©n then approached the Director of the Gothenburg Museum of Art and , an architect from the firm Lund&Valentin; to add an art institutional/architectural perspectives to the group. These four ‚Äúfounders‚Äù soon expanded the group by adding people with different strengths: artist and former professor of painting , and economist Lars Stranneg√•rd. =First functions at R√∂da Sten= During the summer of 1994, the Property Management Administration completed a provisional repair of the boiler house. The premiere program was a newly composed ‚Äúpsycho-acoustic‚Äù opera performance based on Dostoyevsky‚Äôs novel The Idiot. In September 1994, thirty-seven artists from Majorna exhibited their work in the boiler house as a manifestation of Kulturprojekt R√∂da Sten. October 1994 brought another exhibition: Ready for Landing, an installation by Michel and Eva Droetto. Forty-five tons of soil were trucked in for the exhibition and covered the floor in the cathedral. In 1995, the Friends of R√∂da Sten Association was established, and during 1995‚Äì1999 the R√∂da Sten Project was dedicated to finding financing and planning for the renovation of the building. =Renovation and inauguration= Shipping magnate Sten Allan Olsson pledged a donation of three million SEK (approximately 360,000 USD) toward the boiler house renovation. The County Labor Board contributed free labor, and the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning offers one million SEK (approximately 120,000 USD) to the renovation. S√∂ren Mannheimer, chairperson of the Chalmers Technical University Foundation, offers 500,000 SEK (approximately 60,000 USD) toward the property renovation and an equal amount for collaboration between artists from R√∂da Sten and technology students from Chalmers. Between September 1999 and September 2000, the boiler house was renovated. On October 6, 2000, the renovated boiler house was rededicated.

Background \\"Lingwood\\", Leytonstone in 1898 where Halszka spent her earliest years Halszka was first of the three daughters of Wanda, n√©e Zieleniewska and her husband, Leon Wasilewski, later to be first foreign minister of the Second Republic of Poland. Her father, who originally came from the Polish community in St-Petersburg, met his future wife, Wanda, at Lw√≥w University where they were both students. He however dropped out of his course and became involved in the Polish independence movement setting up his own \\"university programme\\", in the words of his biographer, Stoczewska.Stoczewska, B.

After meeting J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski in the mid 1890s, he joined the Polish Socialist Party and became an activist. The movement operated across international frontiers with its main groupings centred at the time on Zurich and London. Wasilewski became the editor of the Whitechapel-based political review, \\"Przed≈õwit\\" (\\"Pre-Dawn\\"). He and his wife lived in Leytonstone between 1898 and 1903 in a house called \\"Lingwood\\", where many leading Polish activists would meet and where Pi≈Çsudski stayed after his escape from St. Petersburg.≈öwiƒôtek, Ryszard.

Development On 18 May 2015, France, Germany and Italy launched a European MALE RPAS study over two years, joined by Spain since, to define its operational capabilities, system requirements and preliminary design. In November 2015, the program management was assigned to the European defense procurement agency OCCAR, with European Defence Agency support for air traffic integration and certification. The definition study was to be contracted in the first half of 2016, the potential development and production aiming for a 2025 first delivery. A two-year definition study was launched in September 2016. Airbus, Dassault Aviation and Leonardo unveiled a full-scale mockup at the April 2018 ILA Berlin Air Show. Airbus, Dassault Aviation, Leonardo On 31 October 2018, OCCAR invited Airbus Defence and Space to submit a tender for the program, to coordinate the major sub-contractors, Dassault and Leonardo. On 22 November, the System Preliminary Design Review was achieved, allowing the stakeholders to align their requirements and contract in 2019. In late May 2019, Airbus submitted its offer, but the contract signing may slip from 2019 to 2020. In the summer, the French Senate criticised the platform as \\"too heavy, too expensive and therefore, too difficult to export\\" due to \\"German specifications\\". First flight is scheduled for 2024, before first deliveries for 2027. Design Missions targeted are long endurance intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and ground support with precision-guided weapons. The twin-turboprops are mounted in a pusher configuration behind the wing, similar to the smaller BAE Systems Mantis, and one-third larger than the MQ-9. The drone's dual engines were a demand of Germany, which intended to use the UAV for surveillance over domestic urban areas and was concerned that an engine failure in a single-engine drone could lead to the drone crashing into a house. France, which intends to use the system over the Sahel, has been critical of its cost and weight. At 11,000 kg, it is over twice as heavy as an MQ-9 Reaper.

Published in paperback in 2015 by FMRL, the novel is a seriocomic pastiche of paranormal, sci-fi and neo-noir detective genres. It is the first book of Howell's Lumaville Labyrinth series and part of his \\"Lumaverse\\" story world, which includes the feature film Pill Head, written and directed by Howell. Quantum Deadline shares the same narrator as the author's first novel, The Late Projectionist, though, in Quantum Deadline, the protagonist's name is the same as the author's, i.e., \\"Daedalus Howell.\\"  Plot  Prior to the events of the contemporary-set novel, journalist Daedalus Howell's intern has committed suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, an event for which the character feels responsible and that has sullied his professional reputation. Forced to work for a second-rate blog, Howell is still trying to clear his conscious and his byline five years later. Then he and Jude, a lost 11-year-old thief, happen to both witness a murder in a discount men's suit shop. When they re-meet during the investigation, the boy claims to know Howell but from a parallel universe. He proves this to the reporter by using his original, not professional name, which was Kit Fergus (a.k.a. \\"Chris F.\\" in Howell's previous novel The Late Projectionist). Jude claims he found a smartphone loaded with a game called The Knights of Skeldaria. An Easter egg in the app sent him to Howell's universe where no records of his existence can be found to the consternation of Detective Shane, Howell's wary friend. Howell pitches Jude's story to his editor at the local news blog he writes for but is dispatched to cover a 100-year-old's birthday instead. There he meets Mac, an elderly and retired reporter who claims to have written the notorious \\"Dewey Defeats Truman\\" headline, except where he came from it was correct. Mac, like Jude, is from a parallel universe and urges Howell to help the boy. When Howell contacts Detective Shane seeking information, the boy has vanished. Howell resolves to find and help the boy as a means of reconciling with the intern he was unable to talk out of suicide. This leads him to both his ex- girlfriend, Annika Strang, an artificial intelligence researcher, and his old college friend and sometime rival Cameron Block, whose success in tech ‚Äî particularly the Knights of Skeldaria video game ‚Äî has long rankled Howell. The reporter connects the dots between Block and Strang's research and the Easter egg Jude alleges to have activated, which brought him into Howell's universe. Hijinks ensue, leading to a fatal showdown between Howell and Block.  Critical reception  Carly Fjeld of SciFi Bloggers observed that Quantum Deadline was \\"A wonderful blend of mystery, science fiction and dark comedy that keeps readers from putting the story down.\\" Others, such as the North Bay Bohemian's Stett Holbrook found the novel difficult to categorize due to its multi-genre approach. \\"Daedalus Howell's novel Quantum Deadline: The Lumaville Labyrinth is hard to categorize. Let's call it a noirish, sci-fi-lite detective story with a heap of self-parody that's by turns poignant, witty and comic... With humor and verve, the novel takes up some of the experiences and struggles within Howell's personal and professional life. He says he likes to explore 'the liminal space between truth and fact' as it relates to himself,\\" wrote Holbrook. Additionally, the genesis of Quantum Deadline was discussed with the Petaluma Argus-Courier in regard to its author having lived next door to kidnap and murder victim Polly Klaas, whose case is cited as an influence. Bruce Robinson, a host at NPR affiliate KRCB, observed that Quantum Deadline \\"Playfully meshes stylistic conventions with a sardonic self-deprecating protagonist.\\" In the same interview, Howell, admitted that his creative process amounts to drinking a bottle of wine and weeping. In the Pacific Sun, columnist David Templeton characterized the work was a \\"hard-to-categorize novel, a kind of nourishing, comedic, satirical sci-fi mystery.\\"  References  Category:2015 American novels Category:Paranormal films ","title":"Quantum Deadline"},{"id":"57358937","text":"Xiangkou () is a town located in the Wulong District of Chongqing, China.

Summary  In April 1882, Captain Despard with his invalid wife and six children moved into a house known as Garden Reach in Cheltenham, England. The house had been empty for many years, and there were reports of its being haunted. It was in June that Rose, the Captain's daughter, saw the ghost for the first time: > \\"The figure was that of a tall lady, dressed in black of a soft woollen > material, judging from the slight sound in moving. The face was hidden in a > handkerchief held in the right hand (...)on further occasions, when I was > able to observe her more closely, I saw the upper part of the left side of > the forehead, and a little of the hair above. Her left hand was nearly > hidden by her sleeve and a fold of her dress. As she held it down a portion > of a widow's cuff was visible on both wrists, so that the whole impression > was that of a lady in widow's weeds\\". The ghost was seen on a number of occasions between 1882 and 1886 by several people, some of whom also claimed to hear the woman's footsteps. All 17 people who saw it say it was so lifelike that at first, they mistook it for a living person. The Society for Psychical Research was asked to investigate.  The Society for Psychical Research Investigation  Frederic Myers researched the history of the house and found that Garden Reach was built in 1860 and occupied by a husband and wife. After his wife's death, the husband married again. The couple was a heavy drinker and did not have a good relationship. The second wife left the house shortly before the husband died, in 1876 to die shortly afterward in 1878. By obtaining pictures of both women, Frederic Myers was able to allow Rose to \\"identify\\" the ghost as the first wife of the previous owner . Seventeen people claim to have seen the Ghost and it was assumed that it was no longer seen after 1899. Later, after the house was turned into a boarding school for boys, there were stories of a lady being encountered in the corridors, in the stairs and in the gardens. Andrew MacKenzie, an occult and crime writer who is a member of the Society for Psychical Research, wrote a book, Hauntings and Apparitions: An Investigation of the Evidence, in which he claims that three people have seen figures around Garden Reach between 1958 and 1961.

The first ever drone strike conducted in Afghanistan was on Jan 1, 2015, at Spera District, Khost province. There have been a total of at least 4130 airstrikes conducted by the US government, killing at least 3923, with 150 civilians and 36 children.

LBH Jakarta seeks to provide legal aid for the poor, aiding with law illiteracy, and suppressed peoples. LBH was established in 1969 in the city of Jakarta as the first LBH of what would eventually become multiple LBH offices around the country. It was not until 1970, with the support of PERADIN and the Provincial government of Jakarta, that LBH officially began commencing in operations. After the establishment of the YLBHI, which also operates out of Jakarta, the LBH located in Jakarta became the legal aid institute for the city. Now working under the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI), which has 15 LBH branches throughout Indonesia, the Legal Aid Institute of Jakarta operates based on the principle of Structural Legal Aid. Currently, YLBHI acts as the central umbrella in Jakarta for all of the regional LBH branches throughout Indonesia, it is currently lead by Asfinawati as Chairman of Board and Nursyahbani Katjasungkana as the Board of Trustees. LBH Jakarta acts heavily in accordance with 'rule of law', a principle entrenched in Indonesia's constitution. Due to its historical influence, predominantly during the post- Suharto era, it is regarded by some as an institution that works with cases that have the ability of serving justice, but also further the aim of better developing political rationales. In 2017, LBH Jakarta received over 19,000 cases from justice seekers. These cases ranged from involving city and urban issues, labor issues and family issues. In addition they received hundreds of reports dealing with civil society and political concerns, human rights, and women and children issues.  History = Background= The Legal Aid Institute of Jakarta was established in 1969 following discussion at the third congress of the Indonesian Advocacy Association, and founded by Professor Dr. Adnan Buyung Nasution. Dr. Nasution was also a prominent human rights lawyer and activist who entered into the legal profession as a prosecutor in the 1950s. Initially, LBH Jakarta was created as a pilot idea with the support from PERADIN (Persatuan Advokat Indonesia), the Indonesian bar association, and from the provincial government of Jakarta. Despite this, LBH has played a historical role in the creation of what is now the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI), and been a key player in human rights cases throughout Indonesia. LBH was created with the idea of Bantuan Hukum Struktural (Structural Legal Aid) at the forefront of Nasution's motivation for what the institution would eventually become. .\\\\ Nasution maintained the belief that cause lawyering should go beyond the standard routine casework for those who cannot afford it but are in desperate need of it. Officially commencing operations in 1970, LBH took aim at helping those belonging to a lower socio- economic status, operating off of the principle of providing legal aid for the poor, and has been a leading NGO since. During the 1980s LBH Jakarta began applying principles of Structural Legal Aid. LBH Jakarta was the initial LBH in Indonesia, but not soon after its establishment, the formation of 15 other LBH office branches soon followed. These branches are located in 15 different provinces throughout Indonesia, ranging from Medan and Lampung to Bali and Papua. Given all of these different branches, the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) was founded on the basis of supporting the other offices throughout the country.  Suharto regime LBH was established while Indonesia was under the authoritarian regime of Suharto. Entering into power in the late 1960s, Suharto and his 'New Order' maintained a dominance in Indonesia until the end of the regime in May 1998. During this time law was hardly effective, which was one of the primary reasons Nasution kept structural legal aid at the forefront of LBH. Throughout the New Order dominance in Indonesia, LBH became an outspoken critic of the leader's authoritarian regime. Thus leading to the legal aid institution, becoming the immediate source of defence for those accused in subversion and political cases. Many significant political trials were litigated by LBH during the Suharto regime.  Post-suharto regime The end of the Suharto era was seen as a sign of hope by many within the country, as well as on the international level. Numerous new formal structures like the National Law Commission and Constitutional Commission were entrenched, and the post-Suharto removal of restrictions on political activity, helped to facilitate and further anti-corruption activity; by 2000 approximately 450 legally oriented NGOs were identified, while the more exact numbers were estimated to be in the thousands. However, the creation of several establishments and commissions did not directly result in a guarantee of protection of the rights of the underprivileged. The transition period after the fall of the Suharto regime was immersed with corruption. Communal conflict increased in cases explicitly regarding violence against small ethnic groups, women and the lower-class community. Specific to LBH, the number of cases reported post-Suharto increased drastically, and attacks against various LBH offices escalated during this time period, including the 2001 attack on the LBH Jakarta office. = Structural legal aid (bantuan hukum struktural)= Ten years after LBH Jakarta began operating, it began to apply the practice of structural legal aid, which has been one of its most unique qualities as a legal aid NGO. Although the concept was only applied ten years after its founding, the concept was essential to the founder Dr. Nasution's vision of the institution who believed that structural legal aid was pivotal to the role of cause lawyering. Through this approach, the importance of addressing the root of human rights violations is maintained. The concept of structural legal aid is often seen as broad, and is consequently applied as such. Structural Legal Aid is a form of litigation. Briefly, it encompasses public interest litigation as well as activities that are non-litigation based. These may include various forms of research, publication and community education; through this model LBH also engages in the discussion and questioning of numerous government policies and practices that breach the legal rights of Indonesia's citizens. LBH's use of structural legal aid, has brought some challenges to the institution. Given that the approach is quite broad, the institution was operating with various lawyers and legal aid workers of different competencies when it came to the handling of non-court based activities. Additionally, structural legal aid approach also made LBH workers targets of the Suharto regime. = Attacks= The existence of multiple LBH offices throughout Indonesia have not always been received by the entire Indonesian population. This is due in part to the cases they represent and the political activism they engage in. This has been evidenced in various attacks on the physical offices themselves, as well as direct attacks on LBH Directors. Two of these attacks have been on the LBH/YLBHI Jakarta office.  2001 attack  On April 13, 2001 the LBH Jakarta office was attacked by members of the Jakarta Police Precinct. The attack was motivated by the anti-military protests taking place near the LBH Jakarta office. Police officers attempted to arrest some of the demonstrators, some of whom took refuge in the office building. The building was damaged as rocks were thrown at the building, and batons were used to break windows. Five members went on to enter the building, where a Legal Aid Training session (Kalabahu) was being held. 10 of the student activists who sought refuge in the building were assaulted. The attacks on the activists were so violent than an eye-witness claimed to have lost consciousness at the sight of seeing real forms of torture. The LBH Jakarta office being used as a place to take cover is not uncommon as demonstrators often use the building as a safe place whenever interactions between demonstrators and police/military become violent.  2017 attack  On September 18, 2017 in the early hours of the morning, the YLBHI office in Jakarta was attacked by hundreds of anti- communists. The attack was provoked by the belief that an event associated to the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) was being held inside the building. Initially, a day prior to the attack, a rally was held outside the building in opposition to the events believed to be occurring the next day. This rally was held despite both military and police representatives maintaining that the allegations regarding the event were false. After protestors returned the next day, and were met with police resistance, a mob attacked the building at 1:22 am on the Monday morning, resulting in physical damage.  Legal aid in indonesia Legal Aid Organizations are not limited to receiving solely government/public funding. They are permitted to receive funds in various forms such as grants or donations. In terms of receiving funding from the government, the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights is solely responsible. = Advocates law= Law No. 18/2003, also known as the Advocates Law, was one of the only documents outlining legal aid in Indonesia, prior to the 16/2011 law. The Advocates Law came into effect on April 5, 2003. This document not only defined the term 'advocate' but also set out specific requirements for all advocates to adhere to. According to the law, advocates are defined as \\"individuals in the profession of providing legal services, both within and outside court, who fulfill professional requirements set out in the Advocates Law\\" The Advocates Law states the following requirements for all advocates: * Be admitted to the profession by a single Bar Association, which must issue a declaration of admission to the Supreme Court and the Ministry (art. 2(2)); * Hold a law degree (arts. 2(1) and 3(1)(e)); * Participate in professional advocate special education (art. 2(1)); * Have Indonesian citizenship (art. 3(1)(a)); * Reside in Indonesia (art. 3(1)(b)); * Not work as a civil servant or state official (art. 3(1)(c)); * Be at least 25 years old (art. 3(1)(d)); * Pass the Bar Association examination (art. 3(1)(f)); * Have conducted an apprenticeship of at least two continuous years in an advocate‚Äôs office (art. 3(1)(g)); * Never have been convicted of a criminal offence (art. 3(1)(h)); and * Demonstrate good behaviour, honesty, responsibility, fairness, and strong integrity (art. 3(1)(i)). The Advocates Law also outlined the following provisions on legal aid: * Legal assistance is legal service that an advocate provides pro bono to an incapable client (Article 1 No. 9); * In performing his duty an advocate should not discriminate against potential clients based on gender, political interest, ethnicity, race, and cultural or social background (Article 18 paragraph 1); * An advocate has an obligation to provide pro bono legal assistance to incapable justice seekers (Article 22 paragraph 1); * Through the legal assistance he/she provides, an advocate is performing his/her professional duty to provide justice based on the law in the interests of justice seekers, including empowerment efforts (Clarification of Paragraph 2) Despite the provisions set out in this Law, it was criticized for lacking a system of implementation of the provisions it outlined. The Advocates Law was essential to legal aid in Indonesia prior to the era of the new legal aid, and currently still provides a foundation for the provision of legal aid which the new provisions add to or build off of. = New Legal Aid= The beginning of the New Legal Aid in Indonesia was marked by the drafting of Law 16/2011. This law marked an important change in legal aid in Indonesia. Prior to the creation of Law 16/2011, legal aid and public interest law organizations, including LBH Jakarta, conducted their work without legislative or regulatory structures. Legal aid NGOs operated off of minimal decrees issued on behalf of the Indonesian Supreme Court, and the Advocates Law of 2003. Law 16/2011 adds several definitions for legal aid and those who receive legal aid. According to this law legal aid is defined as, \\"legal assistance that is given by a legal aid provider free of charge to the recipient of legal aid\\" and the recipient of legal aid is defined as \\"a poor person or group, and the provision of legal aid includes criminal, civil, and administrative matters, both litigious and non-litigious\\" This new law was a critical development for legal aid in Indonesia; until this piece of legislation was created the only guidelines regarding legal aid specifically existed in the Advocates Law. However, this new law outlines many more relevant aspects of legal aid such as those who are qualified to give and receive legal aid, in addition to the standards that must be met when administering forms of legal aid.  Structure = Cause lawyers= A cause lawyer is defined as a \\"lawyer driven by a \\"willingness to undertake controversial and politically charged activities and/or by a sense of commitment to particular ideals.\\" Due to the socio-political nature of what unites and drives cause lawyers, they address such issues with the aim of achieving a means of greater social justice, like changing laws or regulations. Through addressing certain issue areas, cause lawyers have the capacity to draw attention to the lack of stability within law and politics. In contrast to a 'hired gun lawyer' a cause lawyer can be seen as quite different; a cause lawyer either works as a volunteer or on quite a low salary. Cause lawyers are another unique attribute of LBH Indonesia. Since the 1970s LBH has been a prominent force for cause lawyers. The lawyers within LBH take initiative in seeking judicial review of policies, convictions, and government decisions in general, in forms relevant to court action = Funding= Funding for the Legal Aid Institute of Jakarta has been tumultuous. After 2001, financial support from funding agencies plummeted, the long established donors, Novib and USAID withdrew support. After the Suharto regime collapsed, financial support from domestic sources was scarce. However, LBH has been able to obtain financial support from the Canadian International Development Agency [CIDA], the Partnership Governance Reform in Indonesia [PGRI] and through local donations from the public. LBH Jakarta also receives funding from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID).  Institutional goals The institutional goals and mission of not only LBH Jakarta, but the LBH offices all over Indonesia are: * Establish, promote and disseminate the values of democratic and just law-based state, and uphold human rights in all social segments without condition * Establish and promote independent and empowered ... marginalized people in such a way that enables them to formulate, articulate and struggle for and sustain their collective and individual interests; * Develop systems, institutions and other supporting instruments to increase effectiveness of the efforts to fulfill the rights of the marginalized people; * Initiate, encourage, advocate and support law development programs, enforcement of legal justice and national legal reform in line with the viable Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; * Promote and develop programs that contain dimension of justice in politics, socio-economics, culture and gender, particularly for the marginalized people Overall, the institute aims to be consistent in the fight for democracy and protection of human rights in Indonesia.  Activities LBH Jakarta's activities are categorized into four areas: * Fair Trial * Labor Rights * Urban Poor * Vulnerable Minority After the end of the Suharto regime and following the reformation, LBH Jakarta has been one of the leading institutions in terms of representing religious minorities in cases of religious freedom and violations. These cases have become a large part of LBH Jakarta's agenda, especially due to the 'Blasphemy Law' passing in 2010. Two prominent cases LBH Jakarta represented in regards to blasphemy against Islam are the Aan case in 2012, and Muluk case in 2013. * Alexander Aan was convicted under law 11/2008 on Electronic Transactions and Information. His conviction was based on a post on the \\"Minang Atheists\\" Facebook page concerning the Prophet Muhammad, and was considered blasphemous against Islam. Under this conviction Aan is classified as \\"A person who intentionally and without right spreads information that aims to cause hatred or hostility towards an individual and/or particular group that is based on ethnicity, religion, race or inter-group relations\\". * Tajul Muluk was convicted of \\"blaspheming Islam\\" under Art 156a of the Criminal Code in Indonesia. He was convicted for holding Shia beliefs, which are regarded as inherently \\"deviant\\" by mainstream Sunni organizations in Indonesia . These cases are also examples of the institutions' public interest litigation agenda they have pursued since its early years of implementation. LBH Jakarta has brought cases for judicial review of legislation to the constitutional court, including aforementioned Blasphemy Law in 2010, and in 2012‚Äì13.

It is controversial for rapping about race and society and depicts a heated discussion about race relations from the perspective of a white man and a black man. Lucas has said that the song's lyrics represent the uncomfortable race talk that people shy away from. Composition The track features Lucas rapping from a white man's point of view in the first verse, then rapping from a black man's point of view in the second verse, which is notable as Lucas is biracial. Both verses are supported by an airy, ambient trip hop beat. Music video The song was first released as a music video on Lucas' YouTube channel and has since garnered over 135 million views. It was directed by Lucas and Ben Proulx. The video starts off with a white man wearing a Make America Great Again cap from Donald Trump's presidential campaign opening up about his unfiltered view on the black community, synced to Lucas' first verse. He is talking to a black man in braids who sits across a table from him. The white man in the MAGA hat mentions perceived laziness and lack of goals of the African American community, pointing out the trend of blacks abandoning their children and families in place of partying and dealing drugs. The white man laments that all his \\"hard-earned\\" tax payments went into supporting them, mocking the Black Lives Matter movement. He also criticizes white rapper Eminem, speaking out against Trump, calling him motherfucker, and claiming \\"he ain't white no more\\", the national anthem protests by notable black athletes, and rips blacks for idolizing rapper Tupac Shakur as compared to Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs, saying that rap music has poisoned their minds. He finishes off by blaming blacks for their treatment by police, saying if they pulled up their pants, took the du-rag off and put on a suit, dropped their victim mentality, and quit blaming the white community and everyone but \\"[their] own race\\", then perhaps the police would \\"stop killin' you fucks\\". The white man claims he is \\"not racist\\" due to the fact he has connections to some black people and as he finishes his verse, he states he wishes he knew the dreadlocked man's point of view. The black man then states his own unfiltered point of view, synced to Lucas' second verse (Lucas does not physically appear in the video), countering the white man's stereotypes and critiquing the All Lives Matter movement as a \\"protest to my protest\\". The black man mentions police brutality in the United States and institutional racism in a country run by whites, which gave him no choice but to constantly fear for his life and deal drugs when he was blackballed from getting a decent job, and that his \\"grandmama\\" was a slave and that it still \\"gets to [him]\\". He also mentions the white community's hate for former president Barack Obama and his policies, which led to Trump's election. He then criticizes the white community for misconstruing black stereotypes and stealing black culture, such as fried chicken, barbecue, dance, Kool-Aid, and usage of the word \\"nigga\\" and other black slang. Regarding Tupac, the black man defends looking up to him as he carried the struggle of the black community up to his death and welcomes Eminem's freestyle against Trump as Eminem expressed his solidarity with blacks through it. The black man becomes so angry in the process that he flips the table and swats away his white counterpart's MAGA hat, telling him to stop \\"blaming the blacks and everyone except [his] own race\\" for the country's problems. At the end of his verse, the black man also claims he is \\"not racist\\" and that he wished they could trade shoes. Following the argument, the two men embrace each other, having heard each other's point of view and desiring to reconcile despite their differences. Critical reception the video for \\"I'm Not Racist \\" went viral within a few days of release. It has been characterized as \\"polarizing\\". Some critics have called the video necessary to spark conversation about race by tying in both extremes of the debate, while others criticized it as \\"clich√©d\\" and \\"cheesy\\", and that it oversimplified the race debate by reinforcing stereotypes. On December 7, 2018 the video was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 61st Grammy Awards.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. History The first Methodist circuit riders came to the Farmington area in 1827, and a small congregation was formed in 1829. The first permanent church for the Methodist congregation was built in 1840-44 on Shiawassee Street, and expanded in 1878, when the church had 135 members. By 1919 the congregation began looking for a site to construct a new building. This site was selected for a new building, but before construction was even begun, the 1844 church burned. The congregation met at another church until the new building could be completed. The church selected the Detroit firm of Butterfield and Butterfield to design the church. The Butterfields lived in Farmington and attended the Methodist Church. Ground was broken in 1921., and the church completed in 1922. The new contained both a sanctuary and a separate large auditorium with stage for community events; the church was soon the center of the Farmington community. The congregation continued to grow as people moved into Farmington, and by 1958 there were nearly 900 members. The church completed a new high school in 1953 and a new education wing in 1958. In 1961 the sanctuary and community room were altered, and in 2000 an addition was constructed on the side of the education wing. The congregation continues to flourish and use the building. Description The First United Methodist Church is made up of a 1922 Late Gothic Revival church and an attached, non- contributing, educational wing with an addition. The buildings form an overall U-shaped footprint. The original church is a T-shaped, dark red brick building on a raised basement with a three-story bell tower. It has a steeply pitched gable roof clad with asphalt shingles. The church is divided into two sections: a rectangular gable-roof building that contains the church's sanctuary, and a second gable-roof section forming the head of the T. The bell tower is set in the angle between the two sections, and contains a primary entrance. The exterior has a limestone foundation and limestone water course with Gothic arch openings above containing stained glass windows.

Her verses appear in the major medieval Sanskrit anthologies.  Names and identification  Vijja (IAST: VijjƒÅ) is known by several alternative names. Vidyakara's anthology calls her VidyƒÅ, while Sharngadhara-paddhati uses the Prakrit form VijjakƒÅ. Vallabhadeva's anthology also calls her VijjakƒÅ, although some of its manuscripts use the variations VijjƒÅka or VijjikƒÅ. = Identification with Vijayanka or Vijaya = A verse, attributed to Rajashekhara in Jalhana's Suktimuktavali, states: Some modern writers have identified this Vijayanka (literally \\"having the mark of victory\\") with the Vidya or Vijja (literally \\"knowledge\\" or \\"science\\") mentioned in several Sanskrit anthologies. This person is also identified with Vijaya (r. c. 650-655 CE) of the Chalukya dynasty that ruled the Karnata region in southern India. One of the verses attributed to Vijja compares her to the goddess of learning, Sarasvati, and states that she had a dark complexion unlike the goddess. This verse also mentions the famous poet Da·πá·∏çin (a native of southern India), calling him wrong for describing Sarasvati as \\"all-white\\" in his invocation to the goddess at the beginning of Kavyalakshana. Jalhana's Suktimuktavali contains a variation of this verse, beginning with \\"Not knowing her, VijjƒÅkƒÅ, dark as petal...\\"; Jalhana attributes the verse to an anonymous poet. The verse may be considered as evidence supporting Vijja's connections to South India, but there is no concrete proof she was same as Pulakeshin's daughter-in-law Vijaya. In fact, such an identification results in chronological improbabilities: the poetess whose works mention the 8th century poet Dandin could not have been the 7th century royal Vijaya, unless she lived until the end of the century, and deigned to notice a verse by a much younger author. Dhanadeva, a writer who praises Vijja as a talented poetess, also mentions a poetess called Vijayanka (Vijaya), who excelled in the Vaidarbhi style. Dhanadeva's writings do not clarify if these two women poets are the same person. = Identification as the author of Kaumudi Mahotsava = The Sanskrit play Kaumudi-Mahotsava is known from a single manuscript discovered in Kerala. The manuscript was partially damaged by worms, and had a hole at the place that appears to state the beginning of the author's name in the prologue. The visible part of the author's name can be read as (\\"-kayƒÅ\\"); the ending syllable suggests that this is a feminine name. Scholar Manavalli Ramakrishna Kavi (1866-1957) saw the remains of what he believed to be \\"ja\\", and read the name as \\"jakayƒÅ\\", although Indologist A. K. Warder finds this reading doubtful. Based on Kavi's reading and the space occupied by the hole, some scholars have theorized that the author was \\"VijjakayƒÅ\\", identifying her with Vijja. However, Warder notes that the word could have been another name, such as \\"MorikayƒÅ\\". Alternatively, the broken word may not be a name at all: it is possible that the sentence containing it states that \\"the play was composed with a sub-plot patƒÅkayƒÅ\\". An analysis of the play's style and language indicates that it was definitely not authored by the poetess Vijja: the play resembles the works of earlier authors such as Bhasa, and is highly unlikely to have been composed after the 6th century.  Date  Vijja finds a mention in the writings of Rajashekhara (10th century) and Bhoja (11th century). One of her poems mentions the 7th-8th century scholar Da·πá·∏çin. Based on this, she is believed to have flourished in the 8th or the 9th century.  Poems  Vijja wrote poems featuring topics such as love, nature, changes of season, the sea, and the female beauty. Her verses are characterized by eloquent expressions, long compounds, and rhythmic sound effects. These verses are included in the major Sanskrit anthologies. A verse attributed to Dhanadadevas in Sharngadhara's 14th-century anthology Paddhati names Vijja among four notable women poets: = Example verses = The following verse has been attributed to Vidya by Vidyakara and Shridhara- dasa, to VijjakƒÅ by Sharngadhara, to VijjƒÅkƒÅ by Jalhana, and to an anonymous author by Vallabhadeva: The following verse has been attributed to Vidya by Vidyakara and Shridhara-dasa, to VijjakƒÅ by Sharngadhara, to VijjƒÅkƒÅ by Jalhana. Here, a woman refers to the scratches that she expects her lover to leave on her body.

With the release of their fourth album in 2014, the band underwent a change in style from Dark Rock to Neuen Deutsche H√§rte.  History  After Mikki Chixx and Rico H decided to form a band in spring 2004, they quickly found some like- minded people. Despite several changing bassists, the original formation of the band Stoneman was clear. On October 20, 2006 the debut album Sex Drugs Murder was released, in which Sabine D√ºnser contributed the vocals to Devil In A Gucci Dress and Protect Me. The video for Devil in a Gucci Dress was shown on several TV stations like MTV and VIVA. In autumn 2006 Stoneman were on tour with the Deathstars. In early 2007 Dave Snow switched to bass, whereupon the keyboards are played by a sampler. In May 2007 followed another European tour, this time already as headliner. On September 14, 2007 the second album How to Spell Heroin was released, which was again produced by Dave Snow. It received conflicting reviews. While it was perceived as a clear increase to Sex Drugs Murder, others criticized the songs always built according to the same knitting pattern. In 2008 they performed at one of the biggest festivals of the alternative scene, the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig. Tours with the German rock band Xandria and the glam rocker Wednesday 13 followed, whereby the latter recorded a feature song on the third album Human Hater. In 2011 the band signed a management contract with ICS Festival Service GmbH and the music publisher Enorm Music. In 2014 Stoneman released their fourth and only full German album Goldmarie, which was published by the leading dark label Danse Macabre and Bruno Kramm. The band made it onto the cover and poster inserts LEGACY Musik-Magazin, issue no. 3/2014, interview and poster of specific music magazines Music Magazines: GOTHIC No. 82/2014, ORKUS No. 4/2014 and 05/2014, SONIC SEDUCER No. 4/2014, 05/2014 and 06/2014 The band got a 4th place in the German Alternative Charts (DAC). In 2015, Stoneman was the opening act on the \\"Terlingua\\" tour of Mono Inc. Stoneman also performed on the main stage at the Wacken Open Air, as well as other festival shows.

It offers equity in the start up instead of direct compensation for investors. History Play Business team as of 2017. Started in 2014, the site has several cofounders, including Joan Segura (currently the general director), Fernanda de Velasco and Marc Oyamburu. Oyamburu‚Äôs and Segura‚Äôs experience with video games is behind the idea of the site, both involved in play, critiquing and creating game worlds. As a college student, Oyamburu came across the idea of gamification of real world activities, which is behind the name Play Business. In addition, Oyamburu is a lawyer and economist, which allowed him to develop the idea despite being told it could not be done for legal or financial reasons. The business started with an initial investment of 200,000 pesos, most of which went into paying for servers and the development of the site. The website officially went on-line in March 2015, while still using the laundry room of Joan Segura's parents' house. The company grew 700% in its first year and 300% and 100% in the following years. More recently, the company has been able to rent larger space to allow for offices and are now located in the Condesa neighborhood of Mexico City. As of April 2018, the site has supported over 85 start ups and attracted over 115 million pesos for projects, with 50,000 registered users. Its first client was Briko Robotics, with a goal of 645,000 pesos and even financed itself in part through its own site. Another success story for the site is Tumbiko, a jewelry enterprise which now employs about 1,000 people. However, the management has stated that it has not grown to the level of other online funding site due to lack of funding. In February 2015, the platform reached its beta version. The platform has alliances with organizations which provide investment and other support to start ups. In October 2016, Startup Studio Monterrey signed a contract to collaborate with Play Business. After the election of President Trump at the end of 2016, the site saw a sudden increase in participation. In thirteen days, projects garnered six million pesos, breaking a record. Business model Marc Oyamburu The business model of the company was created to help Mexican entrepreneurs find new and more modern ways to finance start ups, as well as provide investors alternatives to investing abroad. The company believes that a weak peso against the dollar is good for them as it makes U.S. investments less attractive, leading investors to look for alternatives. Its funding method is different from Kickstarter and Indiegogo, and the company claims it is the only one of its type in the world. Instead of offering products or souvenirs to contributors, entrepreneurs, investors and Play Business enter into a contract, with investors offered equity and say in the running of the start up. This percentage is between nine and eleven percent of the total value of the company. The model is called crowdequity rather than crowdfunding. It is an integral model, broken down into steps. Entrepreneurs are called ‚Äúmakers‚Äù and investors ‚Äúplayers.‚Äù While it welcomes projects of all types, it does select those it believes truly addresses a market need with a viable business plan and growth potential. Only about ten percent of applying start ups make it to the platform. Prospective makers must attend a bootcamp to develop their idea, learn about investment tools, how to value their company and how to offer players a role. They do not receive their money immediately, but rather in stages as the project reaches milestones. In this way, players can decide at any time to withdraw from the ‚Äúgame,‚Äù limiting their risk. Joan Segura describes the business as a \\"scale up\\" as it emphasizes the execution of the project in stages. For example, instead of having makers write a business plan on paper, they get the new businesses out to recruit investors. The idea is that if everyone ‚Äúplays well‚Äù (jugar bien in Spanish), everyone wins. The goal of players is to increase the value of their investment and the goal of the makers is to keep the players. If a players retires from the ‚Äúgame,‚Äù others can buy his/her share. Minimum investment for players is 100 pesos per month, but they can invest up to about 500,000 pesos. If a contributor invests four percent or more of the initial investment, s/he becomes an associate of the enterprise and is able to further invest with or without Play Business. Makers report to players every month as well as a trimester report. Play Business charges 5% of the investment, but only if the business reaches its goal amount. Play Business estimates that about 30% of a business‚Äôs initial investment from the platform comes from friends and family.

It feeds on the skin and blood of freshwater fishes in the boreal regions of northern Europe, Asia and North America. Taxonomy Leeches in this infraclass are primitive, and some authors place them in a separate subclass to the Hirudinea. However, the World Register of Marine Species places them within the Hirudinea, as a sister group to Euhirudinea, the true leeches. Acanthobdella peledina was first described by the German zoologist Adolph Eduard Grube in 1851. For a long time, it was believed to be the only species in the infraclass, but in 1966, another species in the genus, A. livanowi, was described from the vicinity of the Kamchatka Peninsula in eastern Siberia. Description A. peledina differs from other fish leeches in not having a sucker at its anterior end; instead, it attaches to its host with about forty hooked chaetae (chitinous bristles) borne on its first five segments. It is in fact unique among leeches in having chaetae at all, and also in having a coelom (body cavity) divided by septa into a discontinuous channel. Other ways in which it differs from other leeches are that the body is divided into 29 segments, it lacks a prostomium and a peristomium, and the nephridia do not have funnels. It has a sucker at the posterior end, and moves in a typical leech fashion by alternately extending its anterior end forward, then clinging on with its hooked chaetae while it brings its posterior sucker close to its front end. The leeches are cylindrical, olive green and about in length. Distribution The species has a boreal distribution and is known from freshwater locations in northern Europe and Asia, and from Alaska. Ecology One of the fish in Alaska parasitized by A. peledina is the sardine cisco (Coregonus sardinella). The leeches were found just behind the pelvic fins with their anterior ends embedded in the skin and muscle tissue below.

By 1852, 300 people, including some slaves, were in the area. The town was incorporated in 1858. A post office operated there from 1855 to 1872. Around that same time, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Episcopalian churches were started in the town. The town diminished around 1870 after Waverly town leaders would not give the railroad the right of way because they feared that the railroad would attract \\"tramps and ignorants to the town and kill cattle\\". In 1896, the population was up to 400, but dwindled to 100 by 1925. By the 1980s, all that was left of Waverly was a cemetery, a Presbyterian church, and a subdivision.

Family and Early Life  Nathaniel Pryor was born about 1806 in Kentucky. He married in 1838 in California, then part of Mexico, at Mission San Gabriel. The record stated his father's name as Nathaniel Pryor (speculated by researchers to be Nathaniel Hale Pryor) of Louisville and Mary Davis was his mother. His bride was Maria Teresa Sepulveda, a descendant of Francisco Xavier Sepulveda, a Mexican colonialist whose descendants owned vast tracts of land in Alta California.  Captured by Mexico  Nathaniel Pryor was noted for his entry into California in March 1828. He was on a fur trapping expedition with several other Americans when captured by the Spanish and taken to the prison at San Diego. His companions were Syvester Pattie and his son James O. Pattie, Richard Lochlyn all from Kentucky, Isaac Stover from Santa Fe, William Pope from Indiana, Jesse Ferguson from Missouri, and Edmund Russell from Pennsylvania. James O. Pattie wrote to John Coffin Jones, the American consul to the Sandwich Islands to ask assistance for their release.  A Citizen of Los Angeles  Upon his release Pryor settled in Los Angeles. A son named Juan Pryor was baptized in 1837. It's unlikely that Pryor was married to the boy's mother Juana Montalvo, as the baptism indicates the child was a \\"es\\" or a born out of marriage. He had two more sons by Sepulveda: Pablo Pryor and Manuel Pryor who died soon after birth in 1840. Miguel Pryor (aka Nathaniel Pryor) is mentioned in an account of the defense of Los Angeles in 1846, during the Mexican War. National newspapers recounted that the citizens of Los Angeles had met in September 1846 to expel the American military who had positioned themselves in California during the war. An escalation in violence had left 150 Americans dead. To stop the bloodshed both sides met to agree on conditions of a cease-fire. The Americans were represented by surgeon Edward Gilchrist and the Los Angelenos were represented by Miguel Prior (sic). Pryor married again in 1848 to Maria Felipe Paula Romero at the Plaza Church in Los Angeles. They had two additional children, Joaquina and Nathaniel Juan. Stephen C. Foster, a mayor of Los Angeles, published in 1884 A Sketch of Some of the earliest Pioneers of Los Angeles in which he recorded meeting Nathaniel Pryor in about 1849.

In 1941, a branch of the hospital was established at 80/82 Leszno Street and, after the liquidation of the so-called small ghetto in August 1942, it was moved to Umschlagplatz, to the building at 6/8 Stawki Street.  History  The idea to build a hospital to treat Jewish children was born in the early 1870s. In 1873 two families: Majer and Chaja Bersohn and their daughter Paulina Bauman together with her husband Salomon bought the land for the construction of the hospital. Initially, the facility was intended for 27 children. The hospital was built in the area between two parallel streets: Sienna and ≈öliska (hence the double address). Thanks to the families‚Äô financial support, the entire hospital complex, designed by Artur Goebel, was built in 1876-1878. The first chief physician of the hospital was Ludwik Chwat. Between 1905 and 1912, Janusz Korczak worked in the hospital as a pediatrician. During the First World War, the financial situation of the hospital changed dramatically, due to the fact that the testamentary and founding provisions were devalued. In 1923 the facility was closed down. The situation changed after numerous interventions of doctor Anna Braude-Heller, thanks to whom hospital buildings that belonged to the Bersohn and Bauman Foundation Board were taken over by the Society of Friends of Children in 1930. Soon, efforts were made to expand the hospital complex, which was financed by the Warsaw Jewish Community and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. After the enlargement the hospital had 150 beds. At the outbreak of the war, the hospital had about 250 hospital beds. The buildings did not suffer any damage during the defense of Warsaw. In November 1940, the hospital was incorporated into the Warsaw Ghetto. German authorities appointed Wac≈Çaw Konieczny from Inowroc≈Çaw as the hospital administrator. Hospital building today, view from ≈öliska Street As the hospital was overcrowded due to a huge increase in the number of children suffering from typhus fever, in October 1941, thanks to the efforts of Anna Braude-Hellerowa, a branch was opened at 86/88 ≈ªelazna Street, at the corner of 80/82 Leszno Street. 400 patients were admitted to the newly-organized hospital. Since February 1942, the staff of the hospital have been taking part in scientific research on hunger disease in the Warsaw Ghetto. The research was conducted in utmost secrecy in order to avoid German ordered shutdown. Postmortem examinations of starved to death patients were carried out in a shed at the Jewish cemetery at Okopowa Street, where they waited for burial in mass graves.Marta Janczewska.

Warszawa: American Joint Distribution Committee, 1946, s. 16. As a result of the reduction of the ghetto area on August 10, 1942 (the liquidation of the so-called small ghetto), the mother hospital and its patients were evacuated from Sienna Street. On August 13, the hospital was moved to the buildings of former common schools at 6/8 Stawki Street in the Umschlagplatz area. Doctors and nurses lived in a tenement house at 22 Pawia St. The hospital staff could enter the Umschlagplatz area in a compact column after a thorough control. In Umschlagplatz, the Bersohn and Bauman Hospital merged with the second Jewish hospital in the Warsaw Ghetto, the Czyste Hospital. On September 11, 1942, the sick and most of the staff (about 1000 people) were deported to the death camp in Treblinka. Adina Blady-Szwajger gave a group of children morphine so that they could die in the hospital in peace, avoiding the suffering of displacement. The hospital complex looking from Sienna Street During the war, at the beginning of 1943, the Children's Clinic from Litewska Street was located in the abandoned buildings of the hospital.Zofia Podg√≥rska- Klawe: Szpitale warszawskie 1388‚Äì1945. Warszawa: Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1975, s. 309. It operated there until the Warsaw Uprising. From August to October 1944, the hospital was the only professional medical facility in the downtown area of Warsaw. Hospital buildings were damaged during the uprising. Entrance to the southern pavilion After the end of the war, in 1946-1950, after reconstruction, the hospital buildings housed the headquarters and apartments of employees of the Central Committee of Polish Jews. It was then adapted back to medical needs and housed a hospital for children with infectious diseases. Between 1988 and 1993 all the buildings were rebuilt and modernized. Later, it housed the Provincial Infectious Hospital named after the Children of Warsaw. In 2000, the center was merged with Children's Hospital in Dziekan√≥w Le≈õny, where all the units were gradually transferred. In 2016, the owner of the property, the local government of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, put the emptied property up for sale.Tomasz Urzykowski.

History Melania Trump made the initiative and came up with the name \\"Be Best\\". Trump said she was willing to face any criticism. She formally introduced the campaign on May 7, 2018. Following her speech in the White House Rose Garden, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation declaring May 7 \\"Be Best\\" day. Unlike policy initiatives by previous first ladies (such as Michelle Obama's Let's Move! campaign against childhood obesity, or Nancy Reagan's Just Say No to drugs campaign), Be Best is broad in scope. The initiative focuses on physical and emotional well- being, and also advocates against cyberbullying and opioid abuse. The initiative began with a slow start, as Trump underwent kidney surgery one week after the campaign was launched. She made no public appearances for the next several weeks. On July 24, 2018, she visited the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tennessee and talked about children with neonatal withdrawal. On August 6, 2018, she tweeted: \\"It's #Backtoschool for many youth this month. As you begin a new year, how will you be the best you? #BeBest\\". She spoke at a cyberbullying summit outside Washington, D.C. on August 20, 2018. Criticism The campaign was accompanied by a booklet that was promoted as having been written \\"by First Lady Melania Trump and the Federal Trade Commission\\" (FTC), but it was nearly identical to a document prepared by the commission in 2014. The similarities prompted accusations of plagiarism, to which her office responded by admonishing the press for reporting on the issue. Following the plagiarism accusations the White House's website changed the copy to read \\"a Federal Trade Commission booklet, promoted by First Lady Melania Trump\\". The fact-checking site Snopes found the charge of plagiarism \\"Mostly False\\", saying: \\"Melania Trump did not claim she had written the pamphlet herself, and she contributed an introduction to a slightly revised version of the booklet. The FTC was always credited for the creation of the booklet and supported its inclusion in the First Lady's \\"Be Best\\" campaign.\\" The slogan \\"Be Best\\" has also been criticized for having an apparent grammatical error, as it is missing a definite article. The Guardian noted Mrs. Trump's native language, Slovenian, does not use definite articles, and speculated whether the name constituted one-upmanship after Michelle Obama's call to \\"Be Better\\". Mrs. Trump's senior adviser, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, called the slogan \\"illiterate\\" and pushed for an alternative slogan, \\"Children First\\", which the First Lady rejected due to the similarities with her husband's \\"America First\\" branding. On December 12, 2019, Melania Trump's 'Be Best' hashtag trended on Twitter after the President sent a critical tweet directed to 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Several media outlets noted that Melania Trump criticized legal expert Pamela Karlan the previous week after Karlan mentioned the Trumps' teenage son, Barron, during testimony as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.

Begun as a line of scented candles, the house now makes fine perfumes as well as bath and body products. The perfumes are created by Pilkington and Geza Schoen.  Background and founding  Ormonde Jayne founder Linda Pilkington grew up in a village in Cheshire, England, where she and her sisters often made beeswax candles, selling them to neighbors. She later lived in Brazil and Argentina, where she became an ice cream vendor, before moving to London in 1992. Her first commission came from a friend who knew of her fondness for making candles and asked her to create a set for the launch of his Chanel fine jewellery boutique. Thinking she might like to pursue the enterprise further, Pilkington invested ¬£1000 in the business and next went to France to study candle-making. The brand grew rapidly, eventually exceeding Pilkington's capacity to keep up with demand. In 2001 she left the wholesale market and opened her own retail shop instead. She began web sales in 2002, accommodating international customers. The brand's name derives from Pilkington's middle name and the address of a former family home. The business is wholly owned by Pilkington and her husband, a banker.  Products  Ormonde Jayne has since grown from candles to include fine perfumes, bath and body products. Perfumer Geza Schoen has worked with Pilkington on perfumes for the line. Reviewing the line in 2009, New York Times perfume critic Chandler Burr wrote, ‚ÄúThe Ormonde Jayne collection has managed to bottle mesmerizing strangeness that stays, just barely at times, this side of unwearable art scents.‚Äù In Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez‚Äôs Perfumes: The Guide, the line‚Äôs titular fragrances Ormonde Man and Ormonde Woman both received five-star reviews. Both fragrances are based on hemlock; Ormonde Man also has notes of juniper berries and oud. Turin and Sanchez also included the pair in their book of 100 ‚Äúclassics‚Äù in perfumery. Other notable Ormonde Jayne fragrances include Orris Noir, based on purple-black iris, pink pepper and pimento berries; Champaca, an orange wildflower from India mixed with green tea, basmati rice and myrrh; Sampaquita, named after a species of jasmine that is also the national flower of the Philippines; Ta‚Äôif, a rose and saffron fragrance named for the city in Saudi Arabia where the rose ingredient is grown; Tolu, a resin mixed with rose; Vanille d‚ÄôIris, vanilla and iris as well as carrot seed, coriander seed, bergamot and musk; Montabaco, with orange absolute, tobacco and leather; and Nawab of Oudh, a blend of ambers, oud and musk. Pilkington also develops Ormonde Jayne fragrances for individual clients, in a six-month process.  Expansion  Eventually Pilkington decided to expand the business again, in part necessitated by the rising rent at her shop in Mayfair. She signed a deal with Saks Fifth Avenue to sell her fragrances in their New York City store, launching in May 2018. Pilkington estimates 2018 sales at ¬£5.1 million.

Pre-Victorian era  The first house built on the site around the early fifteenth century by Ieuan ap David ap Madog ap David Hen of Burton, otherwise known as Dafydd Hen of Burton. Ieuan Llwyd ap Gruffydd ap David Fychan inherited the hall followed by Howel ap David ap Gruffydd Fychan of Talwrn. The children of Howel ap David ap Gruffydd Fychan of Talwrn adopted the surname Powell. A succession of the Powell family owned the hall. Members of the Powell family who owned the hall included, in about 1540, Thomas Powell, the Constable of Holt Castle, who built ‚ÄòPlas Y Horsli‚Äô a timber building surrounded with a moat on the site. In 1792, John Hughes possessed Horsley Hall, with it passing to Dr Francis James Hughes. Townshead and Frederick Potts jointly bought the hall, but through a deal, Frederick Potts became the sole owner.  Late Victorian era  In about 1875, the owner Frederick Potts demolished the timber building and replaced it with a stone building. He resided at the hall until his death in 1898. Between 1898 and 1910, Alfred Ashworth owned Horsley Hall. In 1906, he extended the estate by purchasing 700 acres of the adjoining Parkside estate. Between 1907 and 1912, the hall was enlarged, remodelled in a Jacobethan style, and had a formal garden laid out by the architect George Herbert Kitchin (1870-1951). In 1910, Phillip Henry Ashworth, his only son, inherited the estate. In 1917, the hall was bought by Colonel Hall Walker MP and further improvements made to it. On 27 July 1933, Horsley Hall was sold by auction. The advertisement for the sale describes the Hall in detail. The hall had an outer and entrance hall, Saloon, hall with beamed ceiling, library, gallery, four reception rooms, 20 principle bedrooms and dressing rooms, theatre room, school room, 9 bathrooms, servants bedrooms, head grooms house, chauffeurs cottage, gardeners flat, stabling for 18 horses and 3 garages. Mentioned was the formal gardens and golf course. The sale also included the contents of the hall. On 5 July 1934, the remaining parts of the estate were due to be auctioned. In 1934 a decision was made to demolish Horsley Hall.  Post-1939  At the start of the Second World War, Horsley Hall was still standing and requisitioned by the army. During the war, it was for training and accommodation by Number 12 Camp, Royal Pioneer Corp. Built in the formal gardens were Nissen huts, garages and military building. On 20 April 1950, Horsley Hall was mentioned in the House of Commons when a Member of Parliament raised a question about Lance-Corporal Sankey, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, never seen again and reported as a deserter after leaving the camp on 25 September 1944. In 1955, the army left the site. Horsley Hall, for a short time, was used as a private school but demolished in 1963. Until 1978 a feature of the gardens was a baroque gateway from Great Buckingham Street, London, where Peter the Great once stayed. Horsley Hall, and in the grounds, a dovecote and gazebo are Grade II listed buildings by CADW. The main reason for the listing is, \\"survival of a structure of an extensive Edwardian garden, with some massive rock work and a few fine ornamental trees\\". Some badly deteriorated parts of the hall remain, and the formal gardens are overgrown. The site is now privately owned with no public access.

Initially it was a chapel serving a local asylum and later a hospital church.  History  It is assumed that the church was created in 1327-1404, during the reign of duke Kazimierz I of Cieszyn. His crest includes a golden eagle without a crown on a blue background, similar to the one that can be seen in the presbytery of the church, so one of the dukes might indeed be the founder of the church. The church was built outside the medieval walls of the city, on the so called Frysztackie Suburbs, with a cemetery near it dated 1472 and the first hospital for the sick and the poor in Cieszyn. The church was mentioned in documents once again in 1442, when it became a succursal church of saint Maria Magdalene church. At this time the church was devoted to the Cross of Jesus Christ. In 1653 the hospital church was once again consecrated, and in 1751 a church bell was funded, which in 1826 and 1866 was remelted for military purposes. In 1804-1805 a new tower on the western side was added to the church and in 1840-1855 the church went through a general overhaul. In 1882 fire destroyed the church asylum and from that time the church was no longer a hospital church. During the partitions masses were celebrated only occasionally; on the feast of saint George, the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows and on the Cross Days and the All Souls‚Äô Day. After the cassation of the Jesuits order in 1773 in Cieszyn and Cieszyn Silesia Czech became the dominant language (which was related to services in this language). Czech Jesuits were spreading the cult of saint John of Nepomuk, which is related to placing a sculpture of the saint on the right side of the entrance to the church. After World War I the church was taken care of by German Catholics and masses were offered in German. At the beginning of the 20th century another bell was founded and consecrated in autumn 1922. During the occupation masses were said only on the occasion of the feast of St. George and Our Lady of Sorrows. In 1945 retreating German troops blew up a nearby bridge on Bobr√≥wka river. As the result of the explosion all the stained glass windows in the church were destroyed, a part of the roof was torn and the vault broken. Renovation of the church took place in 1950-1953 version and was attended by the parish priest, father Lichota. In 1961, in fear of influences of the National Church Sunday services were offered on a regular basis. In the summer of 1973 the church went through a general overhaul, when a jubilee of 550 years of existence was celebrated. On this occasion, on 1 September 1974 a solemn mass was concelebrated by bishop J√≥zef Kurpas. By 1901 behind the church there was a graveyard. Currently only a few tombstones remain to be seen. This was the burial place of, inter alia, Karol Miarka and Pawe≈Ç Stalmach.  Architecture  The temple bears traces of the Gothic style. It is made of brick, has one nave, a one-arch three-sided presbytery covered by the cross-ribbed vault. In the presbytery there is a seventeenth century epitaph of Anna Heinel ‚Äì a wife of a chalcographer from Cieszyn and his family ‚Äì founded by Galen Heinel with the initials G.H.A.H. And unknown coats of arms. On the west side of the church there is an adjacent quadrangular tower built in 1806. The side door leading to the sacristy is closed by a steep arch. In the entrance to the sacristy and to the nave (from the south) there are Gothic portals and fragments of Gothic polychrome from the 15th century over the vault. In the spanner of the vault there is a disc with the emblem of the Piasts. The nave is built on a square plan, and splayed windows have Gothic arches.  Holy Masses  Holly mass is celebrated on the following days: Sundays and holy days of obligation: 7.35 am, 10.05 am, 11.30 am Monday: 6.00 pm Tuesday: 6.00 pm Wednesday: 8.00 Thursday: 6.00 pm Friday: 6.00 pm Saturday: 8.00 am, 6.00 pm (Sunday mass)  Trivia  There is an on- line camera installed in the church showing a live view of the altar.

He was known as \\"Jack the Strangler\\", \\"The Women Strangler\\" and \\"The Mata-Meretrices\\".  Modus operandi  He intercepted his victims in the streets (all women between 20 and 40 years old, mostly sex workers), driving them to hotels in Mexico City's Central Zone. He would rent a room, threaten the women and strike them, later violating them; finally, he murdered them, mainly by strangulation with improvised objects in the room (the killer's clothing, the victim's own clothing, drapery cords, cables for household appliances, etc.), although he sometimes stabbed them. He left the half-naked bodies abandoned in the room, usually wrapped up in covers and hidden under the bed. Sometimes he would leave messages written on mirrors and walls.  Unresolved cases  At the end of 1989, the corpse of a strangled woman appeared in the Hotel \\"Magnolia\\" on Magnolia Street, Guerrero Colonia, Mexico City. This crime was considered an isolated incident, but in a short time, at the beginning of 1990, a second woman died in very similar conditions, followed by another 2 in September of the same year. It was evident that there was a link between the crimes, and the evolving method of murder of the perpetrator and their episodic character, suspicions of a serial killer came up. The crimes continued until 1993, when del Valle was arrested for the murder of a sex worker, and after his arrest he became the main suspect in all the cases. But his guilt could not be proven, in total 27 of the 30 cases attributed to \\"Jack the Strangler\\" were unresolved and became cold cases. In addition, several details made the authorities firmly believe that it was the work of either copycats of multiple serial killers. * 1989: the first victim in Guerrero. * 1990: nine victims in hotels in La Merced, Iztapalapa and Anahuac. Here was highlighted the homicide of a sex worker, found on December 1 in Iztapalapa. Until this point the crimes began with women being simpy beaten, raped and strangled, then they were stabbed and cut up, and finally in this case, the victim was mutilated, with her hands and feet cut off. After these nine crimes (from 1989 and the eight of 1990) which surpassed in sadism after each murder, the last murder in 1990 was on December 23, which broke the killer's pattern. Like the very first victim, this woman was raped and strangled, and her body was wrapped in quilts and hidden under a bed. The police considered this the work of a copycat. * 1991: five victims in Obrera, Moctezuma and Anahuac.. The killer's line of evolution was in a zigzag (between very violent crimes and others not so much), this made evident the existence of more than one murderer, unrelated to each other. On January 5, (with the first victim of the year), the murderer made a change in the execution of his crimes, writing with lipstick in one of mirrors in the room the initials \\"LMB\\". The killer had never been interested in giving a message, as he was hedonistic. The desire to be the antagonist and to be identified as a \\"serial killer\\" (especially in ones that are mediated), are characteristic features, more non-exclusive, of copycats or assassins. Of course, this was never proven. * 1992: nine victims. On September 2, with the sixth victim of the year, the perpetrator returned to leave a message, again written with lipstick in a room with the mirror reading: \\"I will return.\\" * 1993: three victims (not including the homicide to which del Valle confessed, which was resolved). = Suspects = Before the arrest of Agust√≠n Salas, the police arrested several men that were suspected of being the strangler: the first was Jaime Meza Roque on December 14, 1990, after the murder of the ninth victim after hitting a prostitute, but his involvement in the crimes could not be proven. In addition, during Roque's imprisonment, the Strangler continued to attack. He was only prosecuted for the physical aggression inflicted on Roc√≠o P√©rez Hern√°ndez. On September 9, 1992, sex worker Raquel Cisneros was murdered in the style of the \\"Mata-prostitutes\\" after being raped and strangled with the strap of her purse. At first the crime was attributed to the serial killer, but this time the murderer behaved sloppy because he let many people see him leave the hotel with the victim and going out alone, leaving fingerprints and DNA samples all over the room and the body. It was evident it was the Strangler's doing. On September 25, Jos√© Luis Ornelas Angulo was arrested, sixteen days after the crime, who was convicted of this homicide. On October 10, 1992, the body of Martha Mart√≠nez Garc√≠a, a 25-year-old sex worker, was found. As in Ornelas' case, the perpetrator made rookie mistakes. The crime scene was a copy of the Strangler's first murder. It even took place in the original murder location, the \\"Magnolia\\" hotel. In addition, that same day another woman was killed but the refined and violent details attributed to the Strangler. Thirteen days later, on October 23, Jos√© Enrique Mart√≠nez Morales declared himself the Strangler, but no matter how much tried to prove it, he could not describe the crime scene correctly due to his knowledge being from the media. He was a simple imitator anxious for recognition and he was detained for the aforementioned homicide. On April 14, 1993, Filadelfo Miranda Rivera was arrested for trying to strangle a prostitute, but had verified alibis for most of the crimes of the Strangler, and it could not be provent that he was connected to any of them. He was only convicted for attempted murder.  Arrest of Agust√≠n Salas  On April 6, 1993, the body of a sex worker was found in a hotel. The details of the crime were shocking: the woman was brutally beaten and stabbed, raped and killed by strangulation with a tie (which was later proven to belong to the murderer); the heart was removed with surgical precision, and the body was left on the bed with arms and legs extended, covered in blankets; the perpetrator had drawn a pentagram and a circle, along with the acronym \\"CO\\" and several scribbles. Witnessed gave a description of a man who entered with the victim. On August 7, 1993, after the Strangler had killed two other victims, Agust√≠n Salas del Valle, a 29-year-old accounting student, was arrested. Testimonies that affirmed his entrance with the woman and his later exit alone, in addition to forensics exams, made Salas accept his fault. He never confessed, nor could it be proven that he had connections to the other murders, but the crime on April 6 (which brought several aggravating circumstances) was enough to condemn Salas to 50 years in prison. After his arrest, the crimes stopped.

Description  It was created as The Great Synagogue of Warsaw‚Äôs library between the years 1879 to 1880 at the behest of Ludwik Natanson, who had come up with the idea in 1860. The funds for setting up the library were raised through public collections. Its existence was further assured by contributions from private founders along with a committee of the synagogue. The Historical Commission was functioning within the Library for many years, up until 1914. Its main purpose was to gather collections, including documents from qahals‚Äô archives and variety of manuscripts. Samuel Pozna≈Ñski was in charge of the Commission. Moj≈ºesz Moszkowski was a long- standing librarian. In 1927, Moses Schorr led activities to build a new headquarters of the Library. The new facility of the Main Judaic Library, erected between 1928-1936 at T≈Çomackie Street 3/5, was designed by Edward Eber. It was also the headquarters of the Institute for Judaic Studies. The building was designed in modernized historicism (semi-modernism), corresponding to the architecture of the Great Synagogue. From November 1940 until March 1942, the building was within the Warsaw Ghetto borders. It hosted the headquarters of the Jewish Social Self-Help, a staging point for Jews forcibly resettled from Germany and a storage unit for furniture stolen in the ghetto. The edifice endured the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw Uprising, although it sustained damage. The Library‚Äôs collections were looted by the Germans. Some were restored after the war (according to other sources, the Library had lost all of its stock, i.e. 40,000 units). On 16 May 1943 there was a fire in the Library which had begun after the explosion in the Great Synagogue. Traces of the fire on the lobby‚Äôs floor are visible today.Tomasz Urzykowski.

The building of the former Main Judaic Library is currently the headquarters of the Jewish Historical Institute. The part of the ghetto that included the Great Synagogue and the Library in the years 1940-1942 has been commemorated by the Warsaw Ghetto boundary marker on the corner of Biela≈Ñska and Corazziego streets in 2008.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Willer joined the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in the 1950s and became the president of the organization a few years after. Because of her energy and dedication, she helped to revolutionize the homophile movement in the 1960s and helped pave the way for future civil rights advancements for the gay community. Family, career, and personal life Shirley Willer was born on September 26, 1922 in Chicago, Illinois. Willer's family consisted of her father, Arthur C. Willer, her mother, Theresa, and her younger sister, Doris. While her father was a native from Illinois, her mother was originally from Austria and received American citizenship in 1919. Her father worked as a salesman for the Prudential Life Insurance Company in Chicago for many years before he became a judge.Year: 1930; Census Place: Norwood Park, Cook, Illinois; Page: 9A; Enumeration District: 2244, https://search.ancestryheritagequest.com/ Arthur, a heavy drinker, often beat his wife and so, in 1931, Willer's mother packed her and her younger sister into the family car and fled. In order to make ends meet, her mother worked split shifts, leaving Willer to manage household activities. Willer obtained a bachelor's degree in nursing at the University of Chicago.Soares, LHA Daughters of Bilitis, tape 2. She later went back to school at the University of Iowa to obtain her master's degree in nursing. In 1941, at age 19, Willer discovered she was a lesbian during a nursing class lecture about mental hygiene. The lecture discussed common terms used to describe people who find individuals of the same sex attractive. The professor stated that lesbians are not attracted to men and oftentimes develop crushes on women. Willer reflected on the lecture and came to the realization that she was a lesbian. Later in an interview, Willer stated that at this moment, she thought to herself \\"Oh, gee, I'm one of those things!\\" She had thought everyone was like that. She never understood why other girls got excited about going out on dates when she preferred the company of other women. After the lecture, Willer spoke with her professor about identifying as a lesbian. Her professor, appalled by her statement, sent her to a psychiatrist who Willer saw for six months. When Willer returned home that evening, she came out to her mother. Disgusted, her mother stated, \\"Where did I go wrong?\\" It took a few weeks before Willer's mother began to accept the fact that her daughter was a lesbian. Willer's mother gave her the book titled The Well of Loneliness, which discussed other lesbians‚Äô experiences on coming out. After reading through the book, Willer was disturbed to find that related words for her sexuality were described as \\"pervert\\" and \\"queer.\\" She developed romantic feelings towards her cousin. Her aunt did not approve and forbid Willer to see her daughter ever again. For most of her life, Willer worked as a registered nurse at the Albert Merritt Billings Hospital in Chicago. She often worked 16-hour shifts due to nursing shortages due to World War II. During her time as a nurse, she filled many different positions, ranging from psychiatric nursing to working with Argonne National Laboratory. Argonne National Laboratory contributed to the Manhattan Project, which helped build America's atomic bomb.Soares, LHA Daughters of Bilitis, tape 1. After living in Chicago, Willer visited California and lived in San Francisco. In 1962, after living in California, Willer moved to New York City. Soon after, she joined the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB), the first lesbian civil and political rights organization in the United States. During her first DOB event, she met founding member Marion Glass (also known Meredith Grey) and they became a couple. Though Willer and Glass remained together for their entire lives, they never married. For Willer, marriage was unnecessary, \\"We don't believe in possession of people\\" she declared. However, she always emphasized the importance of commitment: \\"You're a couple of people who love each other... if I am stronger than you I'm going to lift that heavier thing.\\" Willer eventually became president of the DOB but left the organization during the late 1960s. After leaving the DOB, Willer and Glass moved to Key West, Florida where they spent the last years of their lives together. They opened a rock shop which was quite profitable. They both took part in the growing lesbian and gay community in Key West, with Willer serving as an active member until she died of heart failure on December 31, 1999. Activism Willer's activism was inspired by the mistreatment and violence she and her friends experienced as members of the gay community. While living in Chicago, Willer was the victim of police brutality. She was walking down Rush Street trying to go to The Seven Seas, a gay bar. The officer assumed she was gay and proceeded to harass her, picking her up by the front of her shirt and slapping her back and forth. He called her names saying, \\"You god-damned pervert. You queer. You S.O.B.\\" Willer mentioned in an interview that she became so angry at the policeman that she could have killed him. Though she was angry, she was not frightened and later clearly stated that \\"the policeman had no right to do that to me.\\" In 1947, while still living in Chicago, Willer's close friend Barney was badly burned in a fire. He received inadequate treatment of his wounds by the doctors because he was known to be gay. In addition to this maltreatment, Barney was also delayed transfer to a facility that could have more adequately tended to his injuries, and he died as a result. Later Willer commented \\"I think anybody who calls themselves an American, who believes in any kind of religion, to deliberately allow someone to die or force them into a position where they're going to die, it's unforgivable.\\" These injustices, and Barney's death in particular, inspired Willer to advocate for lesbian and gay rights. She was a proudly out lesbian and refused to work for anyone who did not accept her sexuality. She hoped to inspire others, especially young people, to be similarly open about their sexuality‚Äîeven in the face of parental anger and rejection. Always compassionate, Willer opened up her apartment in San Francisco to lesbians whose families had disowned them. \\"They were usually younger\\", Willer explained. \\"Their parents had thrown them out, they were on the street... I had bedrolls all over the place.\\" Daughters of Bilitis Some of Willer's most significant activism occurred during her time as a member and leader of the DOB. She became the president of the New York chapter in 1963 and became the National President in 1966. Willer was the first national president who did not live in San Francisco, where the DOB headquarters were located. After Willer became president of the DOB, a close friend of hers (whose name remains unknown), also a lesbian, became an anonymous sponsor of the movement. With $3,000 checks distributed to each member, the money initially contributed to the printing of The Ladder, a nationally distributed lesbian publication. To increase membership and awareness of the movement, Willer and Glass began traveling the country to advocate for gay and lesbian civil rights while opening additional chapters. During her presidency, she held classes for psychiatrists to help them understand gay identity. As a result of this, Willer explained that \\"before the 12 years were up the psychiatrists had removed the term lesbian from the lexicon of mental illness. Also the New York Times finally printed the word \\"homosexual\\" and not \\"pervert\\". Despite its success, the organization needed restructuring due to the lack of coordination and communication between higher level officers. In the late 1960s, Willer and Glass pulled the DOB out of ECHO (East Coast Homophile Organization) because its delegates voted in favor of picketing for civil liberties. Soon after, Glass challenged the vote but the national office did not comply, resulting in the DOB's permanent withdrawal from ECHO. Willer and Glass introduced a plan to decentralize the DOB and allow chapters to make their own policies. DOB members thought that the plan needed more consideration which ultimately led to Willer and Glass leaving the organization. There are conflicting opinions on whether they quit the DOB themselves or were fired. Legacy During Willer's lifetime, openly gay people were subject to homophobic treatment.Soares, LHA Daughters of Bilitis, tape 2 As a result of this, the DOB found it difficult to recruit members due to the risks of associating with homosexuals. Most lived discreetly, preferring to pass as heterosexual in public, and often even private, lives. Willer's openness about her relationship with Marion Glass was a dangerous move at the time. Yet the visibility of her love life endured both in and outside of the community. This openness encouraged other couples to follow her and Glass' example, increasing visibility for homosexual couples in the United States. Her work in the DOB increased acceptance of the gay community in general. She later noted a decrease in personal discrimination and police harassment as a result of the DOB's work within the New York chapter. The effect of Willer's work created a sharp distinction between older and younger generations, the former operating with discretion and the latter with open acceptance. At Willer's encouragement, the DOB worked closely with the Mattachine Society, an LGBT civil rights organization founded in 1950 and that initially focused largely on the rights of gay men. The DOB was originally created as a counterpart to this organization and to provide a space for lesbian women. Willer created general guidelines for interacting with the male section of the gay community, and despite some initial struggle, her guidelines ultimately benefited both groups. After the DOB and Mattachine Society disbanded, Willer's efforts to bring gay men and lesbians together helped to form the modern LGBT community. During Willer's tenure as the president of the DOB, she attempted to convince the group to have a more aggressive political stance. But, despite Willer's efforts, the DOB stayed closer to its accommodationist roots. The DOB's reputation for emphasizing accommodation reduced potential membership as alternatives appeared. But the organization's failure prompted other movements to learn from its mistakes.Gerstner, \\"Daughters of Bilitis.\\": 172 Although decentralization played a part in the organization's downfall, it planted the seeds for the demonstration at Stonewall and the post-Stonewall gay liberation movement.Gerstner, \\"Daughters of Bilitis.\\": 171 Some chapters of the DOB remained active even after The Ladder stopped production in 1972. The organization established a $4,000 need-based scholarship fund for members of the gay community. It also created a legal defense fund of $6,000, necessary for the multitude of legal penalties charged to homosexuals living in New York City at the time. Willer primarily drove the fundraiser efforts for these trusts. Season 2, episode 2 of the podcast ‚ÄúMaking Gay History‚Äù is about Willer.

Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past is a 2016 non-fiction book by American author and essayist Chuck Klosterman. Content and concepts The premise of the book is that most of what we believe is likely to be wrong, but to avoid delusions in our perceptions, Klosterman advises us to ‚Äúthink about the present as if it were the distant past.‚Äù Klosterman examines such things as: the history of scientific theories such as gravity, our perception of historical literary geniuses, our interests in entertainment and professional sports‚Äîas background examples to challenge confidence in our contemporary perceptions, to try to detect how those perceptions might be mistaken. In a series of what have been called thought experiments, various topics (literary greats, multiverses, time, dreams, democracy, television shows, sports) are analyzed under ‚ÄúKlosterman‚Äôs Razor‚Äù: the concept that \\"the best hypothesis is the one that reflexively accepts its potential wrongness to begin with.‚Äù Reception But What If We're Wrong? reached The New York Times Best Seller list in the Culture category. Jim Holt wrote in The New York Times that while he was \\"never bored\\" and Klosterman's goals were admirable, the book left him \\"exasperated,\\" Holt asserting the book lacked rigor and treated profound questions with glibness: \\"My hackles raised, I argued inwardly with the author on every page.\\" Kirkus Reviews indicated the book is \\"full of intelligence and insights\\" and \\"makes readers think,\\" challenging our beliefs \\"with jocularity and perspicacity.\\" Publisher's Weekly acknowledged the book was \\"pop philosophy\\" but noted parts were based on interviews of \\"heavyweights,\\" adding that Klosterman's humor and curiosity \\"propel the reader through the book.\\" In The Oregonian, Douglas Perry recognized the impossibility of the predicting the future, explaining why the book includes \\"endless streams of maybes, coulds and ifs, all leading to a shrug\\"‚Äîwhile affirming that Klosterman is \\"good company throughout the long, fruitless expedition.\\" In the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Will Ashton asserted the book to be Klosterman's most wide-reaching accomplishment to date and confirmed the writer‚Äôs \\"signature wit,\\" but wrote that Klosterman appeared \\"overwhelmed\\" by the challenge, leaving \\"an ongoing sense (Klosterman) is grasping here.\\" The book's cover, designed by Paul Sahre, was judged among the year's best, as chosen by the art director of The New York Times Book Review.

Background  The VCU School of the Arts is the art school for Virginia Commonwealth University, a public-research university located in Richmond, Virginia. The School of the Arts, branded as VCUarts, is a nationally recognized art program, which employs around 400 professors on its academic staff. Approximately 202 of these teachers in VCUarts are adjunct professors, who are contractual professors who are paid by credit hour and do not receive employee benefits. Most adjunct professors at VCU, including the School of the Arts are paid about $800 per credit hour they teach, and are limited to two or three classes they can teach per semester. This ultimately leaves them earning a potential annual salary of approximately $15,000, which is just above the federal poverty line. According to a report from Style Weekly, most VCUarts adjuncts make about $10,000 per year, which ranks last of the Top-10 art schools from U.S. News and World Report. In the fall of 2017, adjunct professors began organizing and formed a coalition known as \\"VCU Adjuncts for Fair Pay\\". In December 2017 and again in February 2018 the group protested the lack of pay, and protested in the propose raise in adjunct pay from $800 to $1,000 per credit hour, demanding that it is raised to $2,000 per credit hour. Such a raise would allow a full-time adjunct professor to earn close to $36,000 per year. The group further attacked Michael Rao and his administration for having nearly $1 billion in endowment and used monies to purchase a night club off the VCU Campus.  Reactions  = VCU administration = VCU's Vice President for Finance and Budget Karol Kain Gray said in response that the low pay for adjunct faculty was becoming a moral issue. The Board of Visitors approved a budget for the 2018-19 school year that increased adjunct pay from $800 per credit hour to $1,000 per credit hour, which was about $1,000 less than what the VCU Adjuncts Organizing For Fair Pay demanded. = VCU students = The reception from students, especially art students, was positive. Most of the people in the protests were reported to be students in the VCUarts program.

When the United States entered World War II on December 7, 1941, he began announcing the Coca-Cola ‚ÄúSpotlight Bands‚Äù program from various military bases around America. = Military work = In August, 1944, Bartholomew enlisted in the army as a war correspondent for the Blue Network (ABC), and shipped out from New York in October 1944 to broadcast on the war from London. After several months covering Parliament meetings and conducting personal interviews, he was assigned on February 10, 1945 to General George S.

After the war ended in Europe, he spent the next several months in Germany and then in Norway conducting interviews with German citizens and American soldiers before returning home in Wilmette, Illinois. Bryson is quoted in the book, The Patton Papers, 1940-1945 as saying ‚ÄúIt was his greatest privilege to report on the Third Army during the war and to be close to 'the greatest military genius since Lee and Jackson.' He honestly believed that the war would be still in progress if Patton had not been there. Patton was without doubt the 'greatest front line general in the world' and his Army was the best. He had heard somewhere, Bryson added, that there had been other American Armies engaged, but for him that would always be a rumor.\\"Blumenson, Martin (1974), The Patton Papers 1940-1945, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, , page 713 On September 15, 1945, three months before he died, General Patton wrote a letter to ABC commending Bryson's service with him. John subsequently wrote a letter to the general thanking him for the compliment, and the general promptly responded in a letter to him saying ‚ÄúIt's always a real pleasure to be able to say a good word to a man's boss about a man who has done a good job.

He began his career as a news commentator with John Bartholomew Channel 11 Commentary on television station KKTV and radio station KVOR. News commentary was in its infancy, but for a decade he \\"carved a niche in the minds and hearts of Colorado Springs radio listeners and TV watchers.\\" The Free Press, (May, 1964),‚ÄúJohn Bartholomew Is Sacked by KKTV‚Äù During his decade with KKTV, he and his wife conducted world tours sponsored by KKTV, journeying to 66 countries. He was also a featured speaker for many local organizations and school graduations. After President Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, Bartholomew wrote a screenplay for the movie Countdown in Dallas, which afforded him the opportunity of interviewing Marina Oswald. That same year he also began his career in newspaper journalism with his twice weekly column Personally Yours for The Free Press (later Colorado Springs Sun). After his television show was canceled in 1964, Bartholomew returned full-time to radio as a news journalist and commentator for KVOR. He subsequently became the news director of KRYT radio and several years later, assumed the same position for the new FM station in town, KKFM, where he remained until 1981 when he retired. During his years with KKFM, he wrote the script for Money Savers, a series of syndicated radio programs on financial management. He also wrote and broadcast a series of reports for senior citizens.

Early life Anthony (Tony) Calio, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 27, 1929. He graduated from Northeast High School (Philadelphia) in 1947, and earned a BS degree in physics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1953 and then stayed for some postgraduate study. He served in the Army Chemical Corps at Fort Detrick, Maryland, during the Korean War from 1954 to 1956. Career Calio started his career in 1956 in the nuclear power industry with Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he was part of the team that developed and built the first land-based nuclear power reactor in Shippingport, Pennsylvania. In 1959 he left Westinghouse and did graduate work in physics at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Later that same year, he took a job as Chief of the Nuclear Physics Section at American Machine and Foundry Company in Alexandria, Virginia. In 1961, he co-founded the Mount Vernon Research Company in Mount Vernon, VA, serving as Executive Vice President and Manager of Operations. He helped build a business making scientific instrumentation for the first rocket programs and vacuum chambers for spacecraft testing. They sold the business in 1963 and Calio went to work for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Calio then spent 18 years with NASA. He was first hired as part of the Electronics Research Task Group in the NASA Headquarters Office of Advanced Research and Technology. In 1964, he was appointed Chief of Research and Engineering at the newly established Electronics Research Center in Boston. The next year he returned to NASA headquarters to work for the Manned Space Science Division as the Chief of the Instrumentation and Systems Integration Branch. In 1967 he became the Assistant Director of Planetary Programs in the Office of Space Science Applications. He joined the Apollo Program Office at the Johnson Space Center in 1968, and worked as the Deputy Director of the Science and Applications Directorate. He became the Director in 1969 and assumed responsibility for managing all scientific aspects of the Apollo and Skylab programs, a job he would continue until 1975. During that time he was one of the people responsible for implementing and directing all aspects of the program's science activities for all missions from Apollo 7 through Apollo 17, work for which he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Washington University in St. Louis in 1974. After completing a Sloan Fellowship at Stanford University Graduate School of Business in 1975 and earning an MBA, he returned to NASA Headquarters, where he pioneered early applications of civil remote sensing from space while serving as the Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Science. From 1977 to 1981, he was the Associate Administrator for Space and Terrestrial Applications. He earned the NASA Exceptional Service Medal and the NASA Group Achievement Award in 1969; the Apollo Achievement Award in 1970; the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 1971; the Lunar Science Team Award in 1973 and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1973 and 1981. President Reagan appointed Calio the Deputy Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1981. He became the Acting Administrator of NOAA in 1984 and the Administrator in 1985, serving until 1987. He served as the United States Whaling Commissioner, and helped to gain approval for the international moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. While at NOAA, Administrator Calio led the effort to modernize NOAA's National Weather Service, and to develop the NEXRAD radar and the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System for the 90's (AWIPS 90), the first program of its kind to bring operational satellite data to the forecasting community. Administrator Calio supported the creation of a domestic policy council working group which would look at how the nation could better understand and address changing climate and large-scale environmental change. His work resulted in the creation of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy's NSTC Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainability, which recommended the establishment of the interagency U.S. Global Change Research Program. Calio developed NOAA's Climate and Global Change Program which proceeded to conduct extensive climate research. He also attempted to improve NOAA's geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites program, including the GOES satellites that were launched in the 1990s. After leaving NOAA, Calio was Senior Vice President of the Planning Research Corporation in McLean, Virginia for four years. He joined Hughes Aircraft Company in 1991, where he assisted in the creation of an information technology subsidiary. He was an Executive Vice President there from 1991 to 1995, Senior Vice President and President of Space Systems from 1996 to 1997 and then President of Hughes Information Technology Corporation, Space Systems Division until his retirement. After Raytheon purchased the Hughes aerospace and defense businesses, he stayed on to facilitate the transition to the new organization. He retired from Raytheon in January 1999. Personal life Calio married Betty Delp in 1951, and they had four daughters. His marriages to Delp and Cheryll Madison, whom he married in 1971, ended in divorce. He met Jenanne Murphy while working for Hughes. They were married in June 2000 and retired to Whidbey Island, Washington that year.

It was built by the United States in 1966 and was used by the United States Air Force (USAF) during the Vietnam War in the II Corps Tactical Zone of South Vietnam. It was captured by the People's Army of Vietnam in April 1975 and was abandoned for several decades. Today, the site has been redeveloped as Dong Tac Airport. USAF use In September 1965 Tuy Hoa was identified as a potential site for an air base and in October, following feasibility and soil studies, CINCPAC recommended construction of a base there. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) originally opposed the decision based on cost, logistical, construction capacity/manpower and security concerns, but in December it agreed to begin construction in January 1966. However, in January construction was postponed by MACV in favour of constructing Ph√π C√°t Air Base. In order to speed up construction of the Tuy Hoa base, in February 1966 Air Force Secretary Harold Brown approached Defense Secretary Robert McNamara for approval to engage a private contractor to build the base. After overcoming opposition from CINCPAC and MACV, the USAF signed a Turnkey contract with Walter Kidde Constructors, Inc. to build the base on 27 May 1966. Walter Kidde committed to achieved interim capability within 7 months of contract signing, complete the base within one year and open permanent port facilities within 15 months. Walter Kidde began construction in June and on 15 November 1966, 45 days ahead of schedule, interim capability was achieved when the 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron equipped with F-100 Super Sabres began arriving at the base. Over the following month the F-100 equipped 306th and the 309th Tactical Fighter Squadrons arrived at the base and on 16 December 1966 the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing became operational at the base. Walter Kidde completed the entire contract on schedule and within budget. In November 1966 McNamara instructed the Joint Chiefs of Staff to investigate the possibility of basing 15 B-52s at Tuy Hoa. This proposal was opposed by the Joint Chiefs, USAF Secretary Brown and CINCPAC on cost and security grounds. On 7 June 1968 the Federalized New Mexico Air National Guard 188th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed to Tuy Hoa and would remain there until 18 May 1969. On 14 June 1968 the Federalized New York Air National Guard 136th Tactical Fight Squadron deployed to Tuy Hoa and would remain there until 25 May 1969. On 29 July 1968 a Viet Cong sapper attack on the base destroyed 2 C-130s and damaged a further 5 C-130s, 1 F-100 and 1 C-47. In early 1969 Flight A of the 71st Special Operations Squadron equipped with AC-119G Shadow gunships moved to Tuy Hoa from Nha Trang Air Base, it was later replaced by Flight A of the 17th Special Operations Squadron equipped with 4 AC-119G gunships. On 12 April 1970 Flight A moved from Tuy Hoa to Ph√π C√°t Air Base. On 15 May 1969 the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed to Tuy Hoa. On 28 May 1969 the 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron moved to Tuy Hoa from Bien Hoa Air Base. On 13 July 1970 the last \\"Wonderarch\\" concrete and steel aircraft protection shelters were completed at the base. On 15 October 1970 the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing left Tuy Hoa and moved without personnel or equipment to Homestead Air Force Base. US Army use In late 1970, the base was renamed Tuy Hoa Army Airfield and various U.S. Army units, including all army aviation units based at Ph√∫ Hi·ªáp Airfield were relocated here. The facility was turned over to South Vietnamese government control on 15 January 1971.

Two timed explosives encased in suitcases were planted by the Embassy's front entrance; the resulting blast injured two people and damaged the building's residential section beyond repair. The Irgun targeted the Embassy because they considered it an obstacle to illegal Jewish immigration into Mandatory Palestine. One of the Irgun's intended targets, ambassador Noel Charles, was away on leave during the attack. It was quickly determined that foreign militants from Mandatory Palestine were behind the attack and under pressure from Great Britain, the Italian police, Carabinieri and the Allied Police Force rounded up numerous members of the Betar organization, which had recruited militants from among the displaced refugees. Confirming fears of the expansion of Jewish terrorism beyond Mandatory Palestine, the bombing of the Embassy was the first attack against British personnel by the Irgun on European soil. The British and Italian governments commenced an extensive investigation and concluded that Irgun operatives from Mandatory Palestine organized the attack. The attack was condemned by the leaders of Jewish agencies superintending their refugees. Italy subsequently enacted strict immigration reform and antisemitic sentiment heightened in the United Kingdom. During the early 1950s, Israel lobbied the British to pressure the Italian government not to pursue the militants. In 1952, eight suspects‚Äìincluding ringleader Moishe Deitel‚Äìwere tried in absentia and received light sentences ranging from 8 to 16 months.  Background  The British government anticipated the threat of Jewish terrorism emanating outside Mandatory Palestine in the aftermath of the Second World War. The Irgun had been founded before the Holocaust out of discontent with the Haganah's policy of havlagah, or self-restraint. It became the armed wing of Revisionist Zionism in 1936, a turn related to the Arab recourse to insurrectionary violence in that year, itself a protest against British policy regarding Jewish immigration. Terrorism, the Irgun reasoned, was a winning tactic for it had enabled the Arabs to alter Great Britain's policy on Jewish migration into Palestine. The consequent White Paper of 1939 severely curtailed further Jewish immigration by imposing quotas and ignited a brief military response by the Irgun as well as its later offshoot Lehi, with both concluding that only campaigns of political violence targeting British personnel and installations could shift the British. The Irgun suspended these operations when the Second World War broke out some months later. News from occupied Europe of the Holocaust led them to undertake an insurrection in 1944 under the leadership of Menachem Begin. The Irgun also played a key role in organizing Aliyah Bet to enable clandestine Jewish immigration into Palestine, and is said to have singled out the Embassy convinced that it was a center of \\"anti Jewish intrigue\\" curbing illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine. Before he retired as MI5's wartime Director General in May 1946, David Petrie offered an assessment of the threat of Jewish terrorism in Europe and a warning: \\"the red light is definitely showing\\". The alert was confirmed by his successor Sir Percy Sillitoe in August and September, when he designated the Irgun and Lehi as the possibly planning to assassinate prominent English figures outside the Middle East. MI5 considered Mandatory Palestine a priority within the British Empire and had Defence Security Officers (DSO) stationed within the Mandate, working with local criminal investigation departments (CID) as well as MI5's sister agency the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), to collect intel on Jewish terrorist threats to Britain. Their sources warned that the Irgun and Lehi were targeting British personnel outside Mandatory Palestine. MI5 were obliged to take these threats seriously: on 22 July 1946, the Irgun bombed the King David Hotel, housing British government offices, in Jerusalem, killing 91. A low intensity guerilla war was being waged in Palestine, with sabotage of communication lines and attacks on British soldiers and mandatory policemen, 99 being killed for the period 1 October through to 18 November. While the Haganah decided at this time to suspend its role in sabotage operations, the Irgun and the Lehi extended their operations to Europe to strike at British diplomatic representatives.  Bombing  Remains of the British Embassy in Rome in 1946 British Embassy in Rome in 2011 By November 1945 alone, it was calculated that some 15,000 Jewish refugees had managed to enter Italy over the preceding six months since the termination of hostilities; the country's geographical location was favorable for the traffic of refugees to Palestine. In September 1945, already engaged for several years in an insurgency against the British Mandatory authorities and army in Palestine, the Irgun high command dispatched a mission to Europe whose aim was to organize the flow of displaced Jewish survivors of the Holocaust to Palestine, recruit soldiers, engage in sabotage against Great Britain and coordinate activities among Zionist organizations sympathetic to the cause. Eli Tavin, nicknamed Pesach, was appointed head of operations in the diaspora and set up the first logistical base for the group in Italy. Tavin found strong support there among Italian antifascist resistance groups, and, recruiting many members of the Betar organization among the refugees, many of the latter of whom, residing in camps run by UNRRA were also eager to participate, set up cells through the country, while establishing two schools to train commandos for operations at Tricase and Ladispoli. Already in March 1946, several refugees, Dov Gurwitz(Roumenian), Aba Churman (Polish), assisted by several others ‚Äì Natan Rzepkowicz (Polish), Tiburzio Deitel (Fiume), Chono Steingarten (Polish) and Girsh Guta (Polish), had established an office of Jewish correspondence in via Sicilia 135, near the Allied Intelligenced offices, and this was chosen to become the central office for Irgun operations in Italy. The British Embassy in Italy was considered by the Irgun to be a centre of operations hindering Jewish migration to Palestine, and thus was singled out as a target. Planning for the operation was completed by early October. Before the war Zeev Jabotinsky's Betar movement had obtained permission from Mussolini to have militants train at a Naval College established in Civitavecchia under the auspices of the Italian fascist authorities. According to the historian of fascism Giuseppe Parlato, the Irgun had purchased from the post-war neofascist terrorist group FAR the explosives used for the attempt via the offices of its co-founder Pino Romualdi a fascist who had set up a secret repository of army munitions and explosives after war's end. Furio Biagini states that the material was taken from deposits located in a center administered by UNRRA. On the night of 31 October 1946, Irgun operatives divided into two squads: one daubed a large swastika on the front wall of the British Consulate, and the other planted two explosives, amounting to 40 kilos of TNT encased in suitcases and rigged to a timer on the steps of the Embassy's front entrance in Via XX Settembre. A driver, working for the embassy, noticed the suitcases and entered the rear of the building to report them. A few moments later, at 02:43, the explosives detonated. The report of the explosion echoed throughout the entire city and was sufficiently powerful to shatter all the windows of the houses and apartments within a distance of one kilometer. The 350-children school of the Handmaids of the Sacred Heart was \\"badly damaged.\\" The Embassy's residential section was destroyed by the blast which created a gaping hole in the entranceway. Noel Charles‚Äìthe British ambassador and main target of the attack‚Äìwas away on leave though his quarters were heavily damaged. No British personnel were harmed but two Italians, one a soldier who happened to be passing by and the other the Embassy's concierge, suffered severe wounds that left them in a critical condition.  Aftermath  The bombing was the first terrorist operation by the Irgun against British personnel in Europe; it resulted in both a setback for illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine, and a major public relations disaster for the Zionist mainstream. The chief of the Italian police declared the following day that no Italian nationals were involved, that the incident bore the hallmarks of similar operations against the British in Palestine, and that those responsible were Jews from Palestine, dismissing rumours alleging that Italian fascists might have been responsible. An investigation was conducted by the Polizia di Stato with British and American assistance. On the 4 November the Irgun plastered streets in many Italian cities with notices proclaiming it was behind the explosion and released to an American journalist a communiqu√© claiming responsibility and this was duly reported in The Times on 6 November. The Irgun also threatened more coordinated attacks against Britain, and justified its actions by charging that Great Britain was engaged in a \\"war of extermination\\" against Jews throughout the world. Soon three refugees were quickly arrested on suspicion, and another two detained on 4 November. The Irgun Zvai Leumi sabotage school was discovered in Rome, where pistols, ammunition, hand grenades, and training literature were found. Four other suspects were caught in Genova, and Tavin arrested in December. Among those arrested were Dow Gurwitz, Tiburzio Deitel, Michael Braun and David Viten. Many were members of Betar. The English authorities requested that those rounded up be handed over, for transfer to British prison camps in Eritrea. One of the arrested, Israel (Zeev) Epstein, a childhood friend of the Irgun leader Menachem Begin, attempted to flee from his imprisonment on 27 December 1946. He had been receiving assistance from the American League for a Free Palestine, which provided blankets, food and cash, but which denied sending him the rope with which he escaped. He was shot in the stomach after an Italian officer on the scene fired a warning shot and called on him to stop. He died of his wounds later that day. Eventually after reported pressure from the Allied Command, the suspects were released. The distinguished Italian criminal lawyer Giovanni Persico, who was a friend of Jabotinsky's from their days at university, took on the suspects' defense. In November, the British media began to sensationalize the idea that Jewish terrorism was a threat to Britain itself, creating unsubstantiated accounts of other putative terrorist plots and activities. However, the American League for Free Palestine on behalf of Irgun and Irgun itself made the same threats as what the media was reporting. As a consequence, antisemitic sentiments increased in the United Kingdom. Though the Jewish leadership of displacement camps condemned the bombing, the attack had an adverse effect on refugees in Italy. Encouraged by Britain, the Italian government enacted several pieces of legislation, reforming their immigration policy. The government set a registry deadline for 31 March 1947 and imposed strict travel visa requirements. The Irgun bases of operations in Italy were closed down and shifted to other European capitals where operatives continued to strike at British targets: the Sacher Hotel in Vienna, which at the time was headquarters of the British Army in that area, to name just one. In order not to be outdone by the Irgun, the rival Lehi undertook similar operations against the Colonial Office in London, which the Scotland Yard unit investigating Jewish terrorist activities linked to the Embassy bombing, and only desisted from a plan to release a strain of cholera bacteria into London's underground water supply system by news that the British government had decided to leave Palestine. According to Italian historian Furio Biagini the entire world cheered at the way such bold feats by members of the Palestinian yishuv managed to humiliate Great Britain and the recourse to terrorism by the Irgun and Lehi were complementary to the activities of the Haganah and the diplomacy of the Jewish Agency in effecting the British withdrawal from Palestine. Five years following the bombing, Israel urged Britain to pressure Italy not to pursue eight suspected perpetrators of the bombing who resided in Israel. Five of them had been arrested in Rome but had jumped bail and escaped, while three others had never been arrested. On 17 April 1952, the Italian government tried Moshe Deitel in absentia for his leading part in the bombing. Deitel was found guilty and sentenced to 16 months imprisonment. The seven other suspects were also convicted for taking part in the bombing and received eight-month sentences. The sentences, however, were immediately annulled by amnesties.

Brown is known for his song \\"Don't Stay in School\\", being the lead vocalist for the rock band You And What Army and collaborations with other YouTubers such as iDubbbz, Roomie, Andrew Huang, TheOdd1sOut, Emma Blackery, Dan Bull and PewDiePie. His work spans various genres including electronic, hip hop and heavy metal as a producer, vocalist, rapper, songwriter, DJ and instrumentalist. Among other endeavors are his former electronicore band You and What Army, which had various successes playing Download Festival and Sonisphere Festival. The band was put on hiatus in 2014. Other video content of his include vlogs, music tutorials, education, comedy skits, raps, and challenges. Career  Brown's YouTube channel was created on 14 November 2007. Most early videos were focused on his band You and What Army, or were tutorials, educational, vlogs, reviews and interviews with other musicians. From 2011 onwards, parodies and skits were more prominent on the channel, for example \\"How to Play Dubstep Guitar\\" and \\"Appropriate Faces for 10 Genres of Music\\". On 2 February 2015, Brown published the music video for his song \\"Don't Stay in School\\", which went viral. In the track, he criticizes the school systems for teaching topics he deems unnecessary, instead of teaching practical life skills or topics that interest students. The song has been subject to controversy for seeming to encourage students to drop out of school. However, Brown has stated that it is merely meant to critique the school system, and the words \\"Don't Stay in School\\" refer to the topics discussed in the song. Despite drawing controversy, the song has also received praise from students, teachers and parents. The video was reacted to by parents on the Fine Brothers channel, with many sympathizing with his arguments. Over time, Brown released a series of follow-up videos to \\"Don't Stay in School\\". His final follow-up video, \\"You don't legally have to go to school\\", discusses various unconventional educational options: alternative schools, charter schools, \\"unschooling\\", and homeschooling. In the video, Brown also interviews a student from one of these progressive schools. In 2015, Brown published a song featuring fellow YouTubers Cryaotic and Minx focusing on LGBT issues and him voicing his support for the community in collaboration with the UK-based LGBT charity somewhereto_. In 2017, Brown collaborated with iDubbbz to create a diss track against RiceGum titled \\"Asian Jake Paul\\" as part of iDubbbz's Content Cop series. On 31 March 2019, Brown collaborated with PewDiePie and RoomieOfficial in an upbeat rap/synth pop/hip hop music video titled \\"Congratulations\\". The music video was based on sarcastically congratulating T-Series in surpassing PewDiePie in subscribers, while also bringing up the corporation's past scandals and criticizing the Caste system in India.

He is responsible for 83 U.S. patents and several hundred patents outside of the United States. Plank was born in Calcutta, India where his American parents were Methodist missionaries. As a child, he and his family returned to the United States, ultimately settling in Lafayette, Indiana. He graduated from Purdue University with a B.S. in chemistry, mathematics, and physics in 1936. Plank received his Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1942, also from Purdue University. Plank (right) and Rosinski (left) demonstrating their invention prior to their induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Feb 11, 1979 While researching catalysts for Mobil Oil in the 1950s, Plank and his chemical engineer partner Edward Rosinski came up with the idea to use zeolite, a porous clay-like material that contains microscopic channels approximately the same size as the desired hydrocarbon length for gasoline. The superior activity and selectivity of the zeolite catalysts led to dramatically higher gasoline yields. Additionally, the increased gas oil conversions could be obtained without increasing gas or coke yields, two of the unwanted byproducts of cracking. On July 12, 1960, US Patent No. 3,140,249, Catalytic Cracking of Hydrocarbons with a Crystalline Zeolite Catalyst Composite was submitted and was officially patented on July 7, 1964. Mobil named it \\"Zeolite Y\\" and began using the process commercially in 1964. In 1977, Plank was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Purdue University for his contributions to the scientific community. In 1979, Plank and Rosinski were inducted as the 30th and 31st members of the National Inventors Hall of Fame for US Patent No. 3,140,249, Catalytic Cracking of Hydrocarbons with a Crystalline Zeolite Catalyst Composite. By the mid 1980s, about 35% of US gasoline was produced from zeolite catalytic cracking, saving the country an estimated 200 million barrels of oil per year. Today this process is now used in every major oil refinery in the world, saving consumers billions of dollars a year while extending the Earth's precious oil reserves.Time Magazine, 1998 Plank died from complications from prostate cancer on October 23rd, 1989, survived by his wife Helen, his son Larry, daughter Lois, and four grandchildren.

It has a heart-shaped to more or less round leaf and a single purplish flower with greenish or transparent areas. It is a vulnerable species, found in near-coastal sand and leaf litter.  Description  Corybas expansus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which forms small colonies. It has a broad heart-shaped or almost round leaf long and wide. The leaf is bright green on the upper surface and silvery green on the lower side. The single flower is erect, reddish purple with greenish or translucent areas, long and wide. The dorsal sepal is mostly transparent green, long and wide. It is erect near its base then curves forward, partly covering the labellum. The lateral sepals are linear but tapered, long, wide and joined to each other at the base. The petals are lance-shaped, about long, wide and curved. The labellum is longer than the dorsal sepal and forms a tube about long near its base, before curving and flattening into a concave dish shape, long and wide. The upper part of the labellum is reddish purple grading to white from the centre down. There are teeth or serrations up to long around the edges of the labellum. Flowering occurs in July and August.  Taxonomy  Corybas expansus was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Warrenben Conservation Park and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (expansus) is a Latin word meaning \\"spread out\\", referring to the flared labellum. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements proposed splitting Corybas into smaller genera and placing this species into Corysanthes but the change has not been widely accepted. Distribution and habitat The flared helmet orchid grows in shrubland and shrubby forest in coastal areas on the southern tip of the Eyre, Yorke and Fleurieu Peninsulas and on Kangaroo Island. Conservation Corybas expansus is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. The main threats to the species are inappropriate fire regimes and weed invasion.

The function of a PAT is comparable to that of any turbine, to convert kinetic and pressure energy of the fluid into mechanical energy of the runner. They are commonly commercialized as composite pump and motor/generator units, coupled by a fixed shaft to an asynchronous induction type motor unit. Unlike other conventional machines which require being manufactured according to the client‚Äôs specifications, pumps are a very common piece of equipment widely available in different sizes and functionality anywhere around the globe. When used as a turbine, the rotor moves in the opposite direction, or in reverse, as to when it is operating as a pump. In this manner, it allows the motor to generate electrical power.  History  First mentions of the possibility of using pumps as turbines (PAT) dates back to the early 1930s and are associated to lab experiments performed by Thoma and Kittredge, who first identified the potential for a common pump to function quite efficiently as a turbine by reversing the flow. Subsequently, in the second half of the 20th century, a new impulse for research on this topic came from the pump manufacturing industry. During this time, established collaborations with several research institutes helped develop an in-depth understanding of the phenomena associated with PAT utilization. Efforts were made to develop methods to predict characteristic and efficiency curves. This helped determine the Best Efficiency Point (BEP) of these machines, in turbine mode, and related it to its specifications when used as a pump. The adoption of PATs has the potential to turn economically feasible even hydropower potentials in the \\"pico\\" scale (i.e. less than 5 kW of installed capacity), since they only cost a fraction of a conventional hydro turbine. Recent examples of such schemes are two pilot plants built in 2019 in Ireland and Wales.  Pumped-storage hydroelectricity  In micro Pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH), the same pump/PAT could be used for pumping and generating phases by changing rotational direction and speed. The best efficiency point in pumping usually differs from its reverse mode : a variable-frequency drive coupled to the motor/generator would be needed in order to change from pumping to generating mode and to react efficiently to the PSH load fluctuation .  Theory of operation   Types  Among the existing designs of hydraulic pumps/PATs, \\"centrifugal\\" or \\"radial\\" units are the most used worldwide in a wide variety of application fields. The name is derived from the radial path followed by the fluid in the rotor: from the centre to the periphery when running as a pump and in the opposite direction when flow is reversed. To achieve a higher head drop across the machine, more impellers can be assembled in series to create a multistage unit. Conversely, a double flow radially split pump/PAT design involves a single radial open rotor fed by two symmetric inlets and enable processing a higher flow rate with respect to a standard radial unit. A second type of pump/PAT design is the axial one, in which the fluid interacts with a propeller following a trajectory parallel to the pump axis. Such units are particularly suitable to processing high flow rates with low head difference. Finally, mixed flow pumps/PATs stand in between the applicability range of radial and axial units and have an impeller shaped in a similar way as a Francis turbine. Another special pump/PAT design is that of submersible units, which can possibly be fitted inside a pipe connected to draft tube exploiting small head differences in flowing rivers.
