It is pronounced \\"Jay-Fack\\". It refers to a senior officer who is responsible for the air forces within a joint force; i.e., a military force composed of forces from two or more military departments. The term \\"air forces\\" encompasses aircraft from any service not already designated to specifically support ground forces (e.g., a marine air wing as part of a MAGTF or \\"organic\\" Army aviation assets). The tool by which the JFACC tasks assets is called an air tasking order (ATO). As defined in Joint Publication 1-02, the JFACC is: \\"The commander within a unified command, subordinate unified command, or joint task force responsible to the establishing commander for making recommendations on the proper employment of assigned, attached, and/or made available for tasking air forces; planning and coordinating air operations; or accomplishing such operational missions as may be assigned. The joint force air component commander is given the authority necessary to accomplish missions and tasks assigned by the establishing commander.\\" Confusion While the position is often held by an aeronautically rated United States Air Force officer, an aeronautically-designated officer of any other service can be the JFACC, if that service has the preponderance of air forces in theater (e.g., a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier strike group; a U.S. Marine Corps air-ground task force) and the ability to command and control those forces. The noun adjunct force is not pluralized (as in the incorrect usage \\"joint forces air component commander\\"). The JFACC is the commander of the air component of the joint force.

The Bicycle Kitchen serves and is served by its community, providing a place where people can use tools to empower themselves as bicycle mechanics. The Bicycle Kitchen promotes a do-it-yourself attitude to recycling and reuse. The educational experience is entirely hands-on and any instruction arises out of the interactions between clients and more knowledgeable volunteers. The Bicycle Kitchen also has a strong social aspect where strangers discover shared purpose and mutual respect. The Bicycle Kitchen is entirely run by volunteers and is supported by small individual donations from its everyday clients. Some clients support the Bicycle Kitchen through cash donations while many others donate their time and effort to help clean and organize the space. The community's continuing generosity means that no one need be turned away simply for lack of funds. The Bicycle Kitchen shares the culture of many traditional Bicycle Cooperatives and many of the most dedicated volunteers at the Los Angeles Bicycle Kitchen have been members of bicycle cooperatives in other parts of America and around the world. New volunteers are constantly joining the Bicycle Kitchen and while a knowledge of bicycle mechanics is helpful to volunteers it is not essential. The only real prerequisite is the willingness to engage with people of all backgrounds in a constructive and supportive way. Volunteering at the Bicycle Kitchen is not only a way to find and connect with individuals who are like minded and share your interests, but also it might help you to bridge across social divisions and to repair some of the damage caused by pervasive and ever increasing market driven social stratification. The Bicycle Kitchen is part of a larger do-it-yourself movement and shares many aspects of maker culture and open source culture.  Visiting The Bicycle Kitchen  The Bicycle Kitchen is located at 4429 Fountain Ave in East Hollywood, two blocks south of the large intersection where Hollywood Blvd. and Sunset Blvd meet. It is South of the Vons on Virgil, and West of Sunset Nursery and Akbar on Fountain. The closest subway stop is Vermont / Sunset on the Red Line. Walk one block South and two blocks East to reach the Kitchen. Because the Bicycle Kitchen is run by volunteers with changing schedules, it does not always open on time. It doesn't hurt to call ahead to ask if they are open. The phone number is (323) 662-2776, but the phone is normally only answered when the Kitchen is open. Please understand that the Coronavirus Pandemic has significantly changed Bicycle Kitchen's hours of operation. The Kitchen is currently open for just a few hours per week until the situation stabilizes.  History  The name \\"bicycle kitchen\\" is a version of the more common term \\"bike kitchen\\" which is a popular name among community bicycle organizations. However the LA Bicycle Kitchen has played no small part in popularizing the name throughout the globe in the past decade. The origins of Los Angeles' Bicycle Kitchen date back to 2002, when a tiny bicycle repair workshop was set up in an unused apartment in an intentional community known as the Los Angeles Eco-Village. Jimmy Lizama, a resident and local bicycle messenger, cooked and encouraged others to join him for evenings of bikes, pizza, and beer. Soon other kindred spirits joined the group among them Ben Guzman, Aaron Salinger and Randy Metz. In the following year, the bicycle kitchen became a community resource and a local hot spot for bicycle enthusiasts. By the winter of 2004, the small space could not accommodate the number of people attending, so the loosely organized group of volunteers decided to find a different space and to become a collectively run non-profit organization. In 2005, Ben Guzman signed the lease that brought the Bicycle Kitchen into the forefront of the public's eye by moving it from the confines of the Eco-Village storefront at Melrose and Heliotrope. The neighborhood that the Bicycle Kitchen moved into was in rapid transition quickly became filled with like-minded supportive entrepreneurial young businesses, namely: Scoops (ice cream), Pure Luck (vegan food and beer), Vlad the Retailer (craft items, venue), and Orange 20 (boutique bicycle shop). In 2010, after years of successive rent increases at their location in what was coming to be called \\"The Bicycle District\\" and fearing that the Bicycle Kitchen might get priced out of the neighborhood it became clear that the bicycle Kitchen should purchase a building. In May 2012, after a very successful fundraising campaign, the Bicycle Kitchen was able to move into a larger space only 1.4 miles away from their beloved old neighborhood. Their new home is in a former sapin-sapin bakery at 4429 Fountain Avenue.

The ATO is a large document written in United States Message Text Format (USMTF) that lists air sorties for a fixed 24-hour period, with individual call signs, aircraft types, and mission types (e.g. close air support or air refueling). NATO uses a different text format, ‚Äú.ato‚Äù. The ATO is created by an air operations center which has command and control for a particular theater (e.g. Combined Air Operations Center for Southwest Asia). More specifically, the Combat Plans Division of the AOC is responsible for creating the ATO, as well as the associated Airspace Control Order (ACO) and linked detailed information in the Special Instructions (SPINS). Use of the standardized USMTF allows ATO processing by a variety of legacy computer models, newer software, and even word processors. Since 2004, the ATO has been standardized as an XML schema by NATO Allied Data Publication-3 and US MIL- STD-6040. The ATO was historically known as the \\"fragmentary order\\" or \\"frag order\\". Pilots continue to informally refer to it as the \\"frag\\"; to be \\"fragged\\" to a mission is to be assigned to it, and \\"as fragged\\" indicates that an operation will/did occur in accordance with the original ATO, without modifications.

Through stereo vision, the primary cue for human depth perception, the brain interprets the images as being in three dimensions. However, current technology does not allow the displays to simulate the many other cues to depth perception, so most viewers ignore those cues while viewing 3D displays. Virtual Reality researcher Mark Pesce argues, citing research in Japan, Britain, and America, that there is an adjustment period after watching simulated 3D during which vision is impaired, and that overconsumption of 3D content could lead to increased risk of accidents or even permanent impairment. Pesce says that an unreleased product safety study by Sega led the company to cancel the release of a head-mounted display for the Sega Genesis in the mid 1990s. At present there is no peer reviewed evidence of this condition.

Other features such as creating a Media Library, saving playlists and bookmarking songs were available only to members of its Private Beta program. Just Hear It does now allow users to download songs. File:Just hear it screenshot landing.jpgHomepage Just Hear It's homepage design is very minimalistic and similar to that of Google Search. It features nothing more than a search bar, a few links and a sentence that prompted users to \\"search the web for any song in the world\\". Recently, the sentence had been replaced with the company's slogan \\"Any song. Legal. Free.\\" The interface runs in Adobe Flash, features a glossy black background and is organized in three distinct areas. The left area is occupied by a search bar, the center by a song list, similar to that of iTunes, and the right area by a player and playlist manager. Its player is one of the few on the internet that includes the full functionality of standard music services, including shuffle and repeat buttons. Almost all interactions with the website, including adding songs to playlists and reordering songs work through drag-and-drop actions. The interface features a subtle color changing ribbon-like wave in the background that added to the visual experience.  History  Just Hear It was founded in 2008 in Los Angeles, California by USC student Nicolae Ivanescu and Emory University student Cosmin Panait. Their goal was to \\"change the stereotype that free music is illegal while immersing the user in a unique visual experience\\" and \\"become the place for music\\". Just Hear It launched in Private Beta in late 2008 at USC and Emory University as a free service with no advertisements. During the first months of its private beta stage, the website was visited by well over 1 million people.

The cast included Billy Bob Thornton, Lisa Blount, Harry Lennix, Walton Goggins, and Grace Zabriskie. Ray McKinnon, in addition to playing the role of \\"Snake\\", directed, wrote, and produced the film. The story is about a woman named Chrystal (Lisa Blount) who has been traumatized both physically and mentally from a car accident that took the life of her son. Joe (Billy Bob Thornton), Chrystal's husband, has just been released from jail after a 16-year sentence stemming from multiple crimes he committed. Plot The story takes place in Arkansas. The film was shot in the Eureka Springs, Arkansas area of the Ozark Mountains. It is the story of Chrystal, a woman who has become permanently injured, emotionally detached, and mentally unstable stemming from several traumatic events in her past. The movie begins with Joe fleeing from the police in a high-speed police chase with his wife and son in the same car. While weaving down the mountain roads at a high rate of speed, Joe loses control of the vehicle and ends up rolling down a hill and, subsequently, crashing into a tree. Chrystal is severely injured in the accident, suffering a broken neck. Their son, who the police presumed was flung through the windshield, was never found at the scene of the accident, or anywhere in the surrounding areas. For his role in running from the police and causing injuries to his passengers, Joe is arrested and sentenced to 16 years in prison for a variety of crimes, including fleeing to avoid capture by police. Upon his release from the state prison, Joe comes back to his home in search of a change in his life. He ends up coming back home to his wife, who hadn't divorced him even while he was away in prison. Because of Joe's run-in with the law, and the resulting car accident and loss of their child, Chrystal is permanently injured in her neck that left her a quadraplegic. Although later Chrystal has managed to regain limited mobility in her body, she has completely lost her enthusiasm, emotions, or will to live. As Joe begins to slowly work his way back into her life, she is unsure of whether to accept him once again, fearing what may happen if she does so. He now wants to change and atone for his past life of crime. Forced to face his past to continue with his future, Joe runs into an old enemy of his, Snake (Ray McKinnon). Worried about him, Snake invites Joe to rejoin him in his illegal drug operation.

She is a singer and songwriter of pop and rock for musicals and films. She also plays piano and harmonica. Career B√§ckman grew up in Iggesund (G√§vleborg County) and started her career as a nine years old when she was discovered by a touring radio show. After that, she was called up by the Swedish TV show host, Lennart Hyland, and came down to Stockholm, where she made her TV debut in 1957. After the television appearance, she toured around and sang songs in various public parks. As a teenager she thought it was frivolous with songs and began instead with rock music. In 1973 she began touring across Europe as a lead singer with Sweden's girl rock group NQB. During the late 1970s and 1980s, she worked a lot with her formerly cohabited Dan Hylander. The couple shared the backing band Raj Montana Band with whom she had a breakthrough album, Sista F√∂rest√§llningen. After the split in 1985 she continued as a solo performer. During her solo career she has, among other things, worked with producers as Clarence √ñfwerman (former member of the Raj Montana Band and later producer of Roxette), Mats Wester and Micke Wennborn. In addition to her solo career B√§ckman has also been very active as a songwriter for others and has worked with numerous artists. For example she wrote \\"Stad i ljus\\", which Tommy K√∂rberg won with in The Swedish preselection for Eurovision Song Contest 1988, and since 2006 also is a Swedish hymn. 1993 began the collaboration with Mats Wester where the successful Swedish folk music group Nordman was created, and B√§ckman were from the first beginning text writer in the team until 1998 when the group split. At a reunification in 2005 she turned down to continued cooperation, and was replaced by another songwriter. B√§ckman also wrote the text to the Swedish big hit \\"Gabriellas s√•ng\\" ( Gabriella's song) in the Kay Pollak film As It Is in Heaven, Stefan Nilsson made the music (2004). She has also translated musicals such as Chicago, Evita, and Garbo. 2004 B√§ckman wrote new hymns, an addition to the Swedish hymn book on behalf of the Swedish Church. She also made a Sweden- Finland tour for some time with the jazz legend Jukka Tolonen. In 2010 B√§ckman is up to date with a participation in the Swedish pre selection for Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Magic Star\\" (Swedish: \\"Magisk Stj√§rna\\"), written together with Micke Wennborn. She was noticed for being the only one playing an actual instrument [harmonica] live on stage in the Swedish pre selection since 1999, and also for being the only Swedish artist participating in the Swedish pre selection for 5 decades in a row. In March, the double album P20Y10 was released, and was B√§ckman's ninth studio album. It was produced by Micke Wennborn, that also was included as guitar player in the band together with the line up of David Garfield keyboards, Leland Sklar bass, John JR Robinson drums and percussion. P20Y10 was recorded in Castle Oaks, Los Angeles, and engineered by Steve Sykes.

It is colorless transparent crystalline salt that precipitates from solutions saturated in Mg2+ and SO42‚àí ions at temperatures less than 2 ¬∞C. The synthetic compound was formerly known as Fritzsche's salt. Meridianiite is a naturally occurring mineral species found on Earth in a variety of environments including sea ice, crusts and efflorescences in coal/metal mines, cave systems, oxidized zones of sulfide deposits, salt lakes/playas and Antarctic ice-cores. It is commonly associated with other evaporite minerals such as epsomite, mirabilite, halides, and other sodium-magnesium-sulfates. There is some evidence that it was once present on the surface of Mars, and may occur in several bodies of the Solar system. As of 2012, it was the only undecahydrate sulfate known.  Properties  Meridianiite belongs to the triclinic crystal system, having cell parameters a = 6.7459 √Ö, b = 6.8173 √Ö, c = 17.299 √Ö, a density = 1.512 g/cm3, x-ray diffraction peaks at d-spacings = 5.73, 5.62, 5.41, 4.91, 4.85, 2.988, 2.958 (highest intensity), and 2.940, and is IR active. It produces needle-shaped to broad flat crystals that are clear to colorless-white. Meridianiite decomposes incongruently above 2 ¬∞C to produce epsomite (MgSO4¬∑7H2O) and water. Meridaniite and water have an eutectic point at ‚àí3.9 ¬∞C and 17.3% (mass) of MgSO4. Meridianiite can incorporate large proportions of other divalent cations (whose sulfates themselves do not seem to form an undecahydrate) as solid solution, without changes to its structure. These include nickel (up to about 27% of the cations replaced), zinc (up to about 27%), cobalt (up to about 67%), manganese(II) (about 62%), copper (about 8%), and iron(II) (about 8%). At pressures of about 0.9 GPa and at 240 K, meridianiite decomposes into a mixture of ice VI and the enneahydrate ,  Discovery  In 1837 by C. J. Fritzsche described what he interpreted as magnesium sulfate dodecahydrate, based on the weight loss during dehydration to the anhydrous salt. The substance was referred to as \\"Frizsche's salt\\" and not formally given a mineral name or designation. The crystal structure was later resolved by Peterson and Wang in 2006, revealing that it belonged to the triclinic crystal system, and each formula unit included 11 molecules of water, not 12. The name \\"meridianite\\" is derived from Meridiani Planum, the locality on Mars where it is believed to have existed in the past. The mineral species and the name were approved by the Commission on New Mineral Names and Mineral Nomenclature of the International Mineralogical Association in November 2007.  Occurrence on Earth Meridianiite has been found to occur on the surface of the ice layer formed in winter over the ponds known as Basque Lakes, in Canada. The water in those ponds has a high concentration of magnesium sulfate and other salts. Water seeping through the ice layer evaporates at the surface leaving a deposit of crystalline meridianiite. Meridianiite has also been detected in sea-ice collected in winter from the saline Lake Saroma in Japan, as well as in ice cores from Dome Fuji station, Antarctica, near the summit of the east Dronning Maud Land plateau.  Extraterrestrial occurrence  Imagery of the massive sulfate deposits sent back by the NASA Opportunity Rover in Meridiani Planum show numerous needle-shaped void spaces throughout the deposit. The now empty angular holes are interpreted as being cavities once filled by a highly soluble mineral species, most likely a magnesium sulfate. These cavities are observed to closely match the crystal habit of meridianiite, and have been proposed as sites where crystals of meridianiite were located, having subsequently dissolved when environmental conditions rendered the crystal unstable. Due to the decomposition of meridianiite to 70% epsomite and 30% water, it has been proposed that meridianiite may represent a periodic reservoir of water near the Martian surface. During warmer periods in Mars‚Äô history it is possible that triggered melting of this mineral may help explain the occurrence of some of the chaotic, and short lived, surface-water episodes throughout Martian history. Remote sensing of other planetary bodies has also indicated the presence of numerous hydrated mineral species, including sulfates, near various planetary surfaces, a prominent example of which is Jupiter‚Äôs moon Europa. The relatively smooth, and very young surface of Europa has been interpreted as evidence for a putative ocean beneath the moons icy surface, and is therefore suggestive of liquid brine at depth. Due to the cryospheric conditions present on Europa it is likely that any magnesium sulfate minerals present, and in contact with liquid water, would inherently occur as meridianiite, and thus, it may make up an important mineral phase, and liquid water reservoir at depth.

Cluff was born in Willoughby, Lake County, Ohio. His parents David Cluff (Clough) and Elizabeth (Betsey) Hall joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when Cluff was about one. In 1837 they moved west, intending to go to Missouri, but were delayed by illness and stopped in Springfield, Illinois. In 1840 they moved to Nauvoo to be with the body of the Church, and then moved west in 1846. He arrived in Utah in 1850 in a company lead by Edward Hunter (Latter-day Saint), and in 1853 he served in the Nauvoo Legion during the Walker War. From 1854-1857 Cluff served as a missionary in Hawaii. In the fall of 1857 Cluff left the mission and went to California. Here he was involved in working with lumber mills and met Ann Whipple, whose father Eli Whipple ran a lumber mill. Cluff and Ann Whipple married. Her father, also a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints organized a company of 19 missionaries returning from their fields of labor and a few member families and st out from Redwood City, California for Utah.Overland Trails database entry on Whipple CompanyE. W. Tullidge, Tullidges's History of Utah p. 235 On reaching Utah Cluff returned to his home in Provo, but was soon sent to Salt Lake City where he was stationed in the Beehive House along with John T. Caine, Horace K. Whitney and James Ferguson with orders to watch Johnston's Army as it moved through the city and burn the place if there were indications the peace plan was not followed.Tullidge, p. 235 Cluff then enrolled in the Salt Lake Academy, co-tuaght by Orson Pratt and James T. Cobb until he was called on a new mission. From 1860-1863 he served another mission, this time in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. On October 24, 1863 he married Ann Whipple in Pine Valley, Washington County, Utah. In 1864 Cluff went to Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) with Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, Ezra T. Benson and Alma T. Smith to respond to messages from Solomona and other local elders that Walter M. Gibson, who had been sent by Brigham Young on a mission to Asia and the pacific islands, was committing irregularities such as selling the priesthood and establishing a new quarum of apostles. Upon approaching the shore, their boat was capsized and Lorenzo Snow went under the water. Cluff found and dragged Snow's body to shore and gave him resuscitation after working with him for several minutes. The companions thought that Apostle Snow had died, but Cluff said \\"No, the Lord would not allow him to die being so far away from home\\" and Cluff continued blowing air into Snow's lungs until he rouse from the ground.Matthew J. Grow, et al. Saints, Vol. 2 No Unhallowed Hand p. 322 Cluff and the others were able to reestablish regular order in the Church while in Hawaii. Shortly after this Cluff was the main force in locating Laie, Hawaii to be the new gathering place for the Saints in Hawaii. He received a vision while in Laie confirming it as the right place to set up a settlement.Grow, Saints Vol 2, p. 333 In 1865 Cluff was called as regional presiding bishop over Morgan County, Utah, Summit County, Utah and Wasatch County, Utah.

During his 1870-1871 mission he served as president of the Scandinavian Mission.Church Historian Office, missionary database He served in two Utah Constitutional conventions during the 1870s and 1880s (both of which ended up being without effect since Utah was denied statehood) and also six terms in the Utah Territorial Legislature. From 1877-1901 Cluff served as president of the Summitt Stake, which included all of Summit County, Utah. Cluff was elected to the Utah Territorial House of Representatives in 1865 for the district including Summit County, Utah. He served there until 1870. After being replaced by Orrin S. Lee for one term he was again in the territorial house for the 1874 term. In the next election in 1876 Cluff was elected to the upper house of the state legislature, known as the Council. He was one of four councilors elected jointly from Salt Lake, Tooelle and Summit Counties. The other three were Wilford Woodruff, Robert T. Burton and John T. Caine. In 1882 council districts were redrawn and Summit was put with Wasatch County (centered on Heber City), Uintah County, Utah (the main city in this county is Vernal, Utah) and Morgan County. Cluff was elected as the Councilor from this new district. In 1884 Cluff was also made the president of the Council. This was Cluff's last term in the territorial legislature.

Orpheus and Eurydice Eurydice was the wife of musician Orpheus, who loved her dearly; on their wedding day, he played joyful songs as his bride danced through the meadow. One day, Aristaeus saw and pursued Eurydice, who stepped on a viper, was bitten, and died instantly. Distraught, Orpheus played and sang so mournfully that all the nymphs and deities wept and told him to travel to the Underworld to retrieve her, which he gladly did. After his music softened the hearts of Hades and Persephone, his singing so sweet that even the Erinyes wept, he was allowed to take her back to the world of the living. In another version, Orpheus played his lyre to put Cerberus, the guardian of Hades, to sleep, after which Eurydice was allowed to return with Orpheus to the world of the living. Either way, the condition was attached that he must walk in front of her and not look back until both had reached the upper world. Soon he began to doubt that she was there, suspecting that Hades had deceived him. Just as he reached the portals of Hades and daylight, he turned around to gaze on her face, and because Eurydice had not yet crossed the threshold, she vanished back into the Underworld. When Orpheus later was killed by the Maenads at the orders of Dionysus, his soul ended up in the Underworld where he was reunited with Eurydice. The story in this form belongs to the time of Virgil, who first introduces the name of Aristaeus and the tragic outcome.Lee, M. Owen. 1996. Virgil as Orpheus: A Study of the Georgics. Albany: State University of New York Press. p. 9. Other ancient sources however, speak of Orpheus' visit to the underworld in a more negative light; according to Phaedrus in Plato's Symposium,Symposium 179d-e. the infernal deities only \\"presented an apparition\\" of Eurydice to him. Ovid says that Eurydice's death was not caused by fleeing from Aristaeus, but by dancing with naiads on her wedding day. In fact, Plato's representation of Orpheus is that of a coward; instead of choosing to die in order to be with the one he loved, he mocked the deities by trying to go to Hades to get her back alive. Since his love was not \\"true\\"‚Äîmeaning he was not willing to die for it‚Äîhe was punished by the deities, first by giving him only the apparition of his former wife in the underworld and then by being killed by women. The story of Eurydice may be a late addition to the Orpheus myths. In particular, the name Eurudike ('she whose justice extends widely') recalls cult-titles attached to Persephone. The myth may have been derived from another Orpheus legend in which he travels to Tartarus and charms the goddess Hecate.Graves, Robert. 1955. \\"Orpheus.\\" Ch. 28 in The Greek Myths 1. London: Penguin Books Ltd. p. 115. The story of Eurydice has a number of strong universal cultural parallels, from the Japanese myth of Izanagi and Izanami, the Mayan myth of Itzamna and Ixchel, the Indian myth of Savitri and Satyavan, to the Akkadian/Sumerian myth of Inanna's descent to the underworld. The biblical story of Lot's wife, who was turned into a pillar of salt because she looked back at the town she was fleeing, is \\"often compared to the story of Orpheus and his wife Eurydike.\\"Clark, Matthew. 2012. \\"The Judgment of Paris.\\" Pp. 97‚Äì111 in Exploring Greek Myths.

From the 1980s this phrase was used in its brochures, press releases, weapon instruction manuals and other documentation to denote the post-penetration effect of the AT4's HEAT anti-armour warhead against the interior and occupants of armoured vehicles. The phrase now has become more or less standard in modern military terminology.Hewish, Mark \\"FFV's Lightweight AT4, first of a new family of Swedish anti-armour weapons\\", International Defense Review, 5/1982, p. 70Not to be confused with Behind-the- armor effect or After-armour effect which is a term sometimes used to describe the effects of armour piercing shells fired by tanks, antitank cannons and naval warships that have a small high explosive charge in the rear of the projectile that explodes after penetrating the armour plating History During World War II, man-portable antitank weapons using shaped charge warheads, more commonly known today as HEAT projectiles, came into widespread use with almost all armies. These warheads have the advantage of not being affected by the projectile's velocity. They penetrate armour by the detonation of an explosive charge fitted in a liner in the shape of a cone or, more precisely, an ogive. The liner is often made of a soft metal, such as copper. Detonation of this shaped charge turns it into a highly focused stream moving forward at extreme speeds. Like medium and high velocity solid shot armour piercing projectiles, these warheads also cause spalling on the interior of the vehicle's armour plate.(solid shot AP projectiles also strike other items inside the vehicle and transfer very large amounts of kinetic energy to the object(s) struck) A problem with shaped charge warheads is that if the ogive shaped liner is deep, the warhead will have more penetration but will form a smaller hole; smaller holes are associated with less damage inside the armoured vehicle than larger ones. Research on shaped charge warheads has shown a hole that is the size of a large coin on the outside of a tank turret will have the diameter of a pencil lead on the turret's inner face. If, on the other hand, the ogive is shallow, it will have less penetration, but cause a larger hole on the inside which will result in a massive spalling.A rule of thumb for infantry antitank weapons is that if a HEAT warhead has to use more than two-thirds of its official penetration capability, it will have less effect on the interior of the vehicle. In 1954, during the siege of Dien Bien Phu, France had dismantled and flown in a number of M-24 Chaffee light tanks. Their thickest armor was only 25.4 mm. The Viet Minh's main infantry antitank weapon was the old World War Two U.S. 2.36-inch bazooka, captured from Nationalist Chinese forces and supplied by Communist China. During the siege the French launched counterattacks using the M-24 in support of their infantry. One Chaffee took seven hits from 2.36-inch bazookas and still continued to fight, demonstrating that portable rocket launchers were hardly a flawless tank-killer.John Keegan, \\"Dien Bien Phu\\", page 110, Ballantine Books, 1974 Other examples became evident during the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese and their allied forces in South Vietnam were equipped with two types of light anti-armour weapons. One was the 1950s era B-40, which was a Chinese manufactured version of the Russian RPG-2, and the other was the newer RPG-7. The RPG-2 had a shallow cone and the RPG-7 a deep cone. The B-40 had a maximum penetration against armour of approximately 150 mm while the RPG-7 penetration was more than double that of the B-40. But to the surprise of the North Vietnamese, the B-40, while not effective against heavy tanks, was far more effective than the RPG-7 in killing or wounding the occupants of light armoured vehicles, and in igniting the ammunition storage or the vehicle's fuel, including the more modern M113 APC which U.S. and South Vietnamese forces at that time operated in large numbers. In addition, the B-40 proved more effective than the RPG-7 against non-armoured targets, like the bunkers at fire base camps. There are many stories from U.S. Vietnam veterans of the enemy attacking or ambushing very effectively with the B-40.John Weeks \\"Small Arms Profiles #21 - Recoilless Anti-Tank Weapons\\", Profile Publications, 1973 The U.S. Army also discovered that in combat, with rare exceptions, more than one hit by the M72 LAW rocket was required to disable or kill the North Vietnamese PT-76 light tank.William R. Phillips, Night of the Silver Stars, pg 80, Naval Institute Press, 1997 Development The combat record of light anti-armour weapons was studied by the engineers at FFV working on a replacement for the Pansarskott m/68 in the late 1970s. The result was the AT4 with a HEAT warhead that had, as the early AT4 brochures stated, a \\"special beyond-armour effect\\". The designers of the AT4's warhead intended that one hit would cause massive damage to both the occupants and the interior of the targeted vehicle. FFV has said very little about the design of the AT4's warhead, being willing only to describe its effects. Defense journalists and military experts have speculated on the warhead's design. A cutaway photo of the AT4's projectile gave clues. Instead of the standard cone shape liner used by other HEAT warheads, the AT4 has a unique trumpet-shaped liner.Trumpet liners for HEAT warheads were first developed by the Swiss for their U.S. made M47 Dragon wire guided antitank missiles Trumpet-shaped liners are believed to be more effective in resisting the counter-blast of reactive armour tiles, that explode and disrupt the HEAT warhead's particle stream. There has been speculation that the liner in the AT4's HEAT warhead is constructed of a special aluminum alloy. Others have stated it is primarily a copper liner with a secondary liner of aluminum bonded to the back of the copper liner. Another clue to the effectiveness of the AT4 is the presence of a \\"focus ring\\" to concentrate the blast. All public statements to 1984 on the subject are speculative.Staff editors, \\"Tank Killers\\", SOF's Combat Weapons, page 46, Fall/1985 Tests conducted by the U.S. Army on the AT4 confirmed that the claims made by FFV regarding the AT4's devastating post-penetration effect were substantially correct.D. Kyle, Armed Forces Journal International, November 1983, \\"Viper Dead, Army Picks AT-4 Antitank Missile\\", page 21 Description As described by FFV in their first AT4 brochure in 1983,FFV Ordnance, Brochure FFV A 1204-1911 E the beyond-armour effect had five distinctive characteristics upon penetration of an armoured vehicle: * A massive overpressure inside the vehicle of approximately 11 bar over normal. * Secondary fragments from the warhead itself due to the large entry hole, plus more extensive spalling than caused by HEAT warheads of similar diameter. * An intense light that is 100 times brighter than sunlight. * Generation of dense smoke in the armoured vehicle's interior. * Generation of extensive heat inside the armoured vehicle. FFV claims that besides the effect of the massive spalling and fragmentation on the occupants of the armoured vehicle, which is standard for all HEAT warheads to a degree, the massive overpressure and intense heat will ignite ammunition and more importantly the armoured vehicle's diesel fuel.Diesel fuel has a very high flash point and is hard to ignite by a HEAT warhead. In some armoured vehicles, the diesel fuel cells are used as additional protection behind the main armour plating; for example, the Israeli Merkava main battle tank The intense light effect will blind any occupants for at least seven minutes, adding to the obscuring effect of the dense smoke created by the AT4's HEAT warhead.Hewish Mark, \\"FFV's Lightweight AT4, first of a new family of Swedish anti-armour weapons\\", International Defense Review, 5/1982, p. 70 References and notes Category:Anti-tank weapons Category:Explosives ","title":"Beyond-armour effect"},{"id":"26157115","text":"Half the Blood of Brooklyn is a 2007 pulp-noir / horror novel by American writer Charlie Huston.

This opens the door for a two-way exchange between the entities.  History  Three Swift Boats n Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam. Corrado Rudolfo Lutz Collection (va025931) In May 1989, a group of Vietnam veterans from West Texas gathered at Texas Tech University to discuss what they might do, in a positive way, about their experiences in Vietnam. Their meeting was spearheaded by Dr. James Reckner, a Texas Tech military history professor and two-tour Navy veteran of the Vietnam War who had become concerned with his students‚Äô lack of knowledge about the war. The group's immediate decision was to form a Vietnam Archive and begin collecting and preserving materials relating to the American Vietnam experience. On December 2, 1989, the Texas Tech University Board of Regents approved the creation of the Center for the Study of the Vietnam Conflict. Its dual missions are to fund and guide the development of the Vietnam Archive and encourage continuing study of all aspects of the American Vietnam experience. The group of veterans who first met in May 1989 was invited to form a board to provide guidance and support for the Vietnam Center. Since then, the Vietnam Center Advisory Board has met regularly to provide advice as the Vietnam Center and Archive at Texas Tech has evolved. Many of the veterans who attended the first meeting in May 1989 continue to advise the Vietnam Center today. In 2009, the Vietnam Center and Archive celebrated its 20th Anniversary. The guest speaker for the 20th Anniversary Ball was H. Ross Perot. Mr. Perot spoke about his work on POW/MIA issues, as well as the experiences of his friend, Congressman Sam Johnson, a former POW from the Vietnam War.  Vietnam Center and Archive's goals  The Vietnam Center's mission is to support and encourage research and education regarding all aspects of the American Vietnam experience; promoting a greater understanding of this experience and the peoples and cultures of Southeast Asia. The Vietnam Center provides administrative support for the Vietnam Archive and promotes education by organizing and hosting conferences and symposia each year. The Vietnam Center is currently located in the basement of the Math building at Texas Tech University. The Vietnam Archive's mission is to collect and preserve the documentary record of the Vietnam War. The Archive is committed to preserving the record of individuals who participated in the War and to providing greater understanding of their experiences. While the Vietnam Archive continues this commitment as its primary objective, it has expanded its collection policy to include records of veterans' organizations and scholars of the period as well as other individuals and organizations who share experiences from the war in Vietnam. The Vietnam Archive has collected millions of pages of material and tens of thousands of photographs, slides, maps, periodicals, audio, moving images, and books related to the Vietnam War, Indochina, and the impact of the war on the United States and Southeast Asia. The Vietnam Archive continues to collect materials today. It is a donation- driven archive, meaning they only have items that people have donated to them. A large portion of their materials are from military veterans, but the archive also contains collections donated by researchers and civilian anti-war demonstrators. The Vietnam Archive places equal importance upon preserving records relating to all aspects of the Vietnam War and wishes to preserve a complete history of the war era. It is currently located in the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library building at Texas Tech University.  Special Projects   The Virtual Vietnam Archive  The Virtual Vietnam Archive was created in December 2000 through funding provided by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and currently contains over 3.2 million pages of scanned materials. Types of material include documents, photographs, slides, negatives, oral histories, artifacts, moving images, sound recordings, maps, and collection finding aids. All non-copyrighted and digitized materials are available for users to download free of charge. When the Virtual Vietnam Archive project is complete, it will include a record for every item in the Vietnam Archive. A staff of full-time employees and part-time student employees work to digitize the materials and place them onto the Virtual Archive. Over 1400 of the Vietnam Archive's collections have been partially or completely digitized. Digitized collections include the Pike Collection, Social Movements Collection, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt Collection, the Combined Document Exploitation Center (CDEC) Collection, and the Diaries of Dr. Dang Thuy Tram. Additionally, over 12,000 documents from the US Marine Corps History Division are available in the Virtual Archive.http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/virtualarchive/redirects/faq.htm Over 700 Oral Histories are available online, many transcribed, as well as over 100,000 images. New materials are being added daily. In addition to the Virtual Vietnam Archive search page, which allows users to research across all media types, the Vietnam Archive has also created a search page specifically for their map collection. This page allows for searching by map title, scale, latitude/longitude, and grid zone. There are currently over 1000 maps are available.  The Oral History Project  The Oral History Project of the Vietnam Archive was created in 1999. The history of the wars in Southeast Asia is not complete without the inclusion of the voices of those who were in some way involved. To that end, the mission of the OHP is to create and preserve a more complete record of the wars in Southeast Asia by preserving, through recorded interviews, the recollections and experiences of all who were involved in those wars. Anyone can participate, whether an American veteran, a former ally or enemy of the U.S., an anti-war protester, a government employee, a family member of a veteran, etc. Currently the Oral History Project has conducted interviews with over 700 people. The audio of all of the interviews is available online, and many have been completely transcribed.  The Vietnamese American Heritage Project  The Vietnamese American Heritage Project, created in 2008, supports the Vietnam Archive‚Äôs mission to document the war from all perspectives by providing documentation of the post-war social and political history of Vietnamese Americans who immigrated to the United States during and after the Vietnam War. A component of the archive, the VAHP is composed of a full-time Vietnamese American Heritage Archivist and one part-time student assistant who collect, preserve, and make accessible to the public materials that document the experiences and contributions of Vietnamese Americans in American society. The VAHP aims to enhance the study of the Vietnamese immigration and resettlement experience by providing reference services to researchers and increasing Vietnamese American participation in the archive‚Äôs Oral History Project, conducting outreach activities, and developing cooperative relationships with other institutions dedicated to preserving Vietnamese American‚Äôs rich heritage. The cornerstone of the VAHP is the Vietnam Archives‚Äô Families of Vietnamese Political Prisoners Association (FVPPA) Collection. During the 1980s and 1990s, the FVPPA successfully helped over 10,000 former Vietnamese reeducation camp detainees and their families immigrate to the US and other countries through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee‚Äôs (UNHCR) Orderly Departure Program (ODP). Jennifer Young Collection (va043454)  Veterans' Organizations and Associations  The Vietnam Archive is actively striving to preserve the history and documents of the Veterans Associations and Organizations, as well as their members. Vietnam Archive staff travel to numerous reunions each year, and many Associations and their members have donated collections of materials. All donated materials are digitized and added to the Virtual Vietnam Archive.  Online Exhibits  Online Exhibits are used to highlight Vietnam Archive materials and to celebrate or commemorate events or aspects of the Vietnam War. Recently added exhibits include The Tet Offensive; Saigon: April 30, 1975, and pages celebrating the birthdays of each of the US Military Branches. The Online Exhibit program is ongoing, and new exhibits are added often.  Subject Guides  Staff of the Vietnam Archive have created subject guides on a variety of topics in order to provide researchers with better and more comprehensive access to the materials in the Vietnam Archive's collections. Recently added topics include: The Tet Offensive; April 30, 1975 Saigon; Dustoff / Medevac; and Agent Orange. Subject Guides include links to digital materials, including still images, moving images, documents, maps, and oral histories.  Conferences, Symposia, and Events  The Vietnam Center and Archive maintains an active schedule of events, including a yearly conference or symposium, a guest lecture series, annual film festival, and an annual celebration of the Vietnamese New Year, Tet. Many of these events are free and open to the public.  Conferences and Symposia  Since 1993, the Vietnam Center has hosted at least one conference a year, usually in the spring, with every third year being a larger symposium. The smaller yearly conferences are focused on a single topic, with the topic changing each year, and feature one panel of presentations at a time. Recent topics include: \\"Lessons Learned, Lessons Lost: Counterinsurgency from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan;\\" \\"Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and the Vietnam War;\\" and \\"The Impact of Culture, Ethnicity, Race, and Religion in the Vietnam War.\\" The Triennial Symposiums are much larger and have a variety of topics. Any interested person can submit a paper for presentation, and there are often multiple simultaneous presentations. All sessions of the conferences and symposia are filmed, and the videos are placed online for researchers and people who were unable to attend to view.  Guest Lecture Series  In 2011, the Vietnam Center and Archive initiated their first Guest Lecture Series. Speakers for the inaugural season included: Adrian Cronauer, the Former Air Force DJ made famous in the movie \\"Good Morning Vietnam!\\" Adrian later served as a Special Assistant to the Director of the Pentagon's POW/MIA Office; Kim Phuc, also known as \\"the girl in the picture,\\" was photographed running down a road naked and on fire after a napalm strike on her village. Kim now runs a non-profit organization dedicated to healing children in war- torn areas and is a UNSECO Goodwill Ambassador for Peace; LeAnn Thieman, a nurse involved in Operation Babylift, a mission to evacuate Vietnamese babies from South Vietnam as it fell to communist troops in 1975; Dr. Kara Dixon Vuic, a professor at Bridgewater College in Virginia and author of \\"Officer, Nurse, Woman: The Army Nurse Corps in the Vietnam War;\\" and Dave Carey, a retired Navy Captain shot down over Vietnam who spent five and a half years as a POW in Hanoi. The lecture series continues in 2012 with five new speakers, including noted author and veteran of the Vietnam War Dr. Lewis \\"Bob\\" Sorley; Chief Executive Officer of the Marine Corps University Foundation Brig. General Tom Draude; PTSD expert, author and veteran of the Vietnam War Dr. Raymond Scurfield; former Air Force Pilot and member of the National Aviation Hall of Fame Dick Rutan; and former running back for the Pittsburgh Steelers and member of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade in Vietnam Rocky Bleier.  Asian Pacific American Heritage Month Film Festival  The Vietnam Center and Archive holds a film festival every month celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage Month (APAHM). Selected films cover a wide range of topics, and often focus on the Vietnamese American experience. Films in the 2011 festival include Green Dragon; Rashomon; the Toll of the Sea; and Kim's Story. APAHM is May, but the film festival is held in April so that students at Texas Tech may attend before finals and the summer break.  Tet, The Vietnamese New Year  Every year the Vietnam Center hosts a celebration of the Vietnamese New Year, Tet, on the Texas Tech Campus. The festivities include Vietnamese food traditionally served on New Years, and a program about Tet. Recent programs have been put on by members of the TTU Vietnamese Student Association.http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/events/tet/  Future of the Vietnam Center and Archive  The remembrance of the Vietnam War has expanded at a fast pace at Texas Tech, and the Vietnam Center and Archive are rapidly outgrowing their current spaces and in need of a greatly enlarged new facility. The Texas Tech System Board of Regents has allocated 12 acres of land on the existing Texas Tech campus for this new building, which will enable the gathering of all aspects of the Center and Archive under one roof. As well, the creation of a world-class museum of the Vietnam War will portray the young men and women who served in Vietnam in an honorable and objective way. At the same time, the museum will critically examine all aspects of American policy in Vietnam. The facility must provide adequate storage and office space for a rapidly expanding archive, oral history project, Virtual Vietnam Archive and Vietnam Center Staff. Also important, the building will provide meeting facilities for Vietnam veteran groups to hold reunion meetings, facilitating Vietnam Center and Archive staff in displaying veteran group-specific artifacts that might not at that time be on display for the general public. Vietnam veterans will have an opportunity to critique the Texas Tech Vietnam War museum, and provide memories and other insights that will help the project staff to gather correct versions of individual stories. The new facility will attract even greater donations of artifacts and documents, making the planning of future space essential. The facility will also have adequate outdoor spaces for static display of major military artifacts, such as aircraft and military equipment.

A native of the city of Summerside, Carmody was a biology student at the University of Prince Edward Island when she broke onto the curling scene by winning three consecutive provincial junior championships, twice with an undefeated record. She entered the national scene in 2010 after forming a rink with longtime teammate Geri-Lynn Ramsay and veteran curlers Kathy O'Rourke and Trisha Affleck that captured the 2010 provincial championships at the senior level. At the 2010 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the squad made it all the way to the final, but lost in the last match to three-time tournament champion Jennifer Jones. After the event, Carmody was presented with the Sandra Schmirler Most Valuable Player Award. Personal life Carmody was born on August 4, 1988 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island and she has a younger brother, Anson, who also curls competitively. In 2006, she entered the University of Prince Edward Island to study biology and, in 2009, won the school's Robert Haines Memorial Science Award of Merit. She is also athletically active outside of curling and was the fastest woman a five kilometre charity race in her hometown for the Prince County Hospital, finishing fourth overall among the sixty-one competitors. In the fall of 2011 Carmody began further studies at the University of Calgary. As of 2019, Carmody is currently a student at Mount Saint Vincent University. Career 2003‚Äì2007 One of Carmody's earliest curling victories came in 2003, while skipping out of the Silver Fox Curling and Yacht Club, when she won the Prince Edward Island provincial 15 and under championship alongside Geri-Lynn Ramsay, Candace Cameron, and Courtney Champion. Later that year she and Ramsay were members of the Vanessa Aylward rink that won the junior women's Eastern Canadian Junior Cashspiel. The following year, with Ramsay and new additions Anita Casey and Danielle Chaisson, Carmody's rink captured the provincial 17 and under championships, a feat that Carmody and Ramsay repeated as members of the Danielle Sharkey rink in 2005. In the latter tournament Carmody threw fourth stones. The following month the squad captured the Atlantic 17 and Under Curling Championship, and later in the year finished in second place in the Under 20 division of the Maritime Junior Cashpiel and won the 3rd annual Bathurst Curling Club Junior Cashspiel with an undefeated record. The following year they were runners-up in both the provincial 20 and Under and 17 and Under championships. 2007‚Äì2009 Carmody made her breakthrough in 2007 when her rink, consisting of herself as skip, Lisa Moerike as second, Ramsay as third, and Jessica van Ouwerkerk as lead stone (a lineup that had participated in several cashpiels the previous year), captured the 2007 provincial junior curling championships with a perfect 7‚Äì0 record. They then advanced to the 2007 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, where they finished eighth out of thirteen teams. The squad took the provincial junior championships for a second time in 2008 and repeated their feat of a perfect record, before placing ninth out of thirteen at the 2008 Canadian Junior Curling Championships. Later that year the rink took the 2008 Codiac Curling Maritime Junior Bonspiel in the Under-21 category. In 2009 Moerike was replaced with Darcee Birch, but Carmody's rink won the provincial junior championship for the third consecutive time. The squad had their best national finish at the 2009 Canadian Junior Curling Championships when they placed fourth, narrowly missing a spot in the semifinals. 2009‚Äì2011 In 2009 Carmody and Ramsay received a call from veteran curlers Kathy O'Rourke and Tricia Affleck, who decided to join forces with the younger players under a team skipped by O'Rourke, but with Carmody throwing the skip rocks and O'Rourke throwing second. Ramsay would throw third and Affleck would take the lead position. The squad found quick success by winning the 2010 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts, which earned them the right to represent Prince Edward Island at the 2010 Scotties Tournament of Hearts. There they finished 8‚Äì3 in the round robin and eventually advanced to the final, where they lost against Jennifer Jones, who represented Team Canada as the competition's previous winner. Despite the loss, however, Carmody received the Sandra Schmirler Award as the tournament's Most Valuable Player. As of 2012, Carmody's most recent provincial win in Prince Edward Island came at the 2011 Prince Edward Island Mixed Curling Championships. Playing third for Brett Gallant, along with her brother Anson Carmody at second and lead Michelle Mackie, her rink defeated defending national champion Robert Campbell's squad 5‚Äì4. At the 2012 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship, Gallant's team finished the round robin with an 8‚Äì5 record and did not advance to the semi-final. 2011‚Äì2013 For the 2011-2012 curling season Carmody, along with Geri-Lynn Ramsay, played with Calgary skip Crystal Webster. Carmody began attending the University of Calgary and Ramsay decided to make the move to Calgary when her boyfriend was offered a new job opportunity. Webster was looking for new teammates, as her third Lori Olson-Johns switched rinks to curl with Cheryl Bernard. During the 2011 tour season the rink won one event and placed second in another, earning automatic entry into the 2012 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts after placing first with Alberta Curling Tour points. They made it to the semi-final of the event with a 4‚Äì2 record before losing to Heather Nedohin, the eventual winner. The team had less success the next season, winning just one game at the 2013 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts. The team also played in the 2012 Canada Cup of Curling, going 3-3 and missing the playoffs. 2013‚Äì2016 Carmody joined the Laura Crocker rink in 2013, playing third for the team. The team played in the 2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Pre-Trials, but were eliminated in the triple knock-out event, having won just two games. The team lasted just one season, and Carmody did not return to competitive curling until the 2015-16 curling season, when she played third for Jessie Kaufman. The team played in the 2016 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts, where they made it to the playoffs, but lost in the semifinal to Team Chelsea Carey. 2016‚Äìpresent In 2016, Carmody moved back to the east coast, and joined Team Jill Brothers, throwing third on the team. In their first season together, the team won two events. The team played in the 2017 Nova Scotia Scotties Tournament of Hearts, making it as far as the finals, where they lost to Mary Mattatall. The next season, the team won one tour event, and lost in the semifinal of the 2018 Nova Scotia Scotties Tournament of Hearts. In the 2018-19 curling season, they again won one event on the tour, and won the Nova Scotia Scotties in 2019.

He won the first land victory against the Japanese in the Second World War, at the Battle of Milne Bay, New Guinea. Like many other senior officers involved in the Papuan campaign, he was then transferred to a less important posting by General Sir Thomas Blamey. Early life and First World War Clowes was born at Warwick in Queensland, and entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 1911. In August 1914 he graduated and was appointed lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) with a commission in the Permanent Military Force. Posted to the 1st Field Artillery Brigade, he landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, serving as a forward observation officer and directing naval gunfire against Turkish positions. He was wounded at Gallipoli. After he recuperated Clowes was promoted to captain in the 2nd Divisional Artillery in Egypt during January 1916. On the Western Front during 1916, Clowes served as the 2nd Division's Trench Mortar Officer and was awarded the Military Cross. He received a promotion to major in January 1917 and the following year was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his work at Villers-Bretonneux. He returned to Australia in April 1919, and left the AIF in late June. Inter war years In 1920 Clowes took up a post as instructor at Duntroon, and remained there until 1925. That year he married Eva Magennis, and moved to Brisbane. There Clowes undertook staff, training, and command duties until 1930. He filled similar positions in Sydney and Darwin until, in 1936, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He went to England and completed a gunnery staff course, before returning to Australia as the Chief Instructor at Sydney's School of Artillery. In August 1939 he was given command of Australia's 6th Military District, receiving a promotion to colonel. Second World War When the Second World War began, Clowes was made a temporary brigadier in the AIF, and in April 1940 was appointed commander of the Royal Australian Artillery, I Corps. Clowes performed very well under pressure in directing the fighting withdrawal at Pinios Gorge, Greece, in April 1941. The Germans were attempting to drive a wedge between Greek units and the allied force sent to their aid. Clowes was successful in holding the gorge against a strong German tank attack, until the situation on other parts of the front stabilised. Although Greece fell and the campaign was a failure, Clowes' tactics minimised casualties in the withdrawal of the allied force. This battle saw the beginning of a problem that would dog Clowes' career ‚Äì disputes between his superior General Sir Thomas Blamey, and Blamey's Chief of Staff, Colonel Sydney Rowell, a personal friend of Clowes. Clowes returned to Australia in January 1942, was promoted to temporary Major General, and given command of the 1st Division. Milne Force Milne Bay within Territory of Papua, 1942. The highlighted area is enlarged below. Area of the Battle of Milne Bay, indicating some key locations. In May 1942 General Douglas MacArthur, Allied Commander in Chief of the South West Pacific Area (C in C SWPA), ordered the construction of an airfield at Milne Bay, at the eastern tip of New Guinea. His intention was to use this and other new airfields to attempt the reconquest of Rabaul, taken by the Japanese early in the war. However the airfield would also be a prize for the Japanese to attack. Once taken it could be a base for bombing sorties over the cities of south eastern Australia. MacArthur requested Thomas Blamey send troops to secure the construction site. Initially a militia brigade was dispatched. As building progressed this was progressively reinforced with regular troops. Once buildup was complete, the garrison assumed the name Milne Force, and Clowes, now promoted to Major General, was given command. He reached Milne Bay and assumed command of the Australian troops there just four days before the Japanese began landing, beginning the Battle of Milne Bay. Battle of Milne Bay The Japanese made their initial landing on 25 August 1942 under Commander Yoshihide Hayashi. By dawn of 26 August, the Japanese had reached KB Mission. A counterattack by the 61st Militia Battalion drove the Japanese from KB Mission, however after six hours of intense fighting, the militia withdrew to the Gama River. Clowes ordered the Australian 2/10th Infantry Battalion to the Gama River, where they attacked. The Japanese troops and the supporting tanks inflicted severe casualties on the 2/10th, which was forced to retreat to north of No. 3 Strip (under construction), on 27 August. The 25th Battalion held the Japanese back and a two-day lull followed. On 29 August 768 Japanese marine reinforcements were landed with Commander Minoru Yano, who took over from Hayashi. On 31 August at 3:00am, three banzai charges were repelled at No. 3 Strip with withering machine gun and mortar fire from Milne Force. The Australians launched a counter offensive at 9:00am on 31 August, and pushed the Japanese along the north coast of Milne Bay. By 4 September Japanese resistance was suicidal in intensity. On 5 September, the Japanese high command ordered a withdrawal. On 6 September the offensive reached the main camp of the Japanese landing force. That night most Japanese survivors were evacuated. Some, trying to reach the Japanese beachhead at Buna through the mountains, were intercepted and routed. Difficulties at Milne Bay Two Royal Australian Engineers with Clowes, Milne Bay, 21 September 1942 Milne Bay is a very high rainfall area, and the all-pervading mud made transport a constant problem for Clowes. He had no barges or four-wheel drive vehicles for moving troops around. Letter from Clowes to Official Historian, Gavin Long, AWM 67 3/74 Milne Force included the highly trained 18th Infantry Brigade of the Australian 7th Division, but also the inexperienced and poorly-equipped 7th Militia Brigade. Of the total force of 8,824, only about 4,500 were infantry. Several times during the battle, urgent signals arrived from MacArthur and Blamey, warning of imminent Japanese reinforcements, and urging him to pursue and exterminate the enemy landing force immediately. However, Clowes' original orders confirmed that his priority was holding the completed airstrip at Gili Gili. He maintained a defensive perimeter there which was never penetrated, even while taking the fight to the enemy at some distance from this base. MacArthur was responding to inaccurate intelligence. Clowes had no choice but to heed the new intelligence, and try to relocate his forces to deal with threats that in fact did not materialise. At one point Rowell received orders from Blamey that the \\"landed force must be attacked with greatest vigor and destroyed as soon as possible\\". Rowell refused to relay this to Clowes, and instead wrote \\"Confident you have the situation well in hand and will administer stern punishment\\". Relieved of command MacArthur and Thomas Blamey determined that rather than being commended and rewarded for the victory, Clowes should be relieved of his command and sidelined for the duration of the war, for showing insufficient \\"vigour\\". Blamey wrote to Sydney Rowell, now Clowes' superior officer in Port Moresby: Blamey subsequently sacked Rowell and shortly after, Rowell's friend Clowes. Clowes returned to Australia in 1943 and held various postings until the end of the war. Later life Clowes retired from the Army with the rank of lieutenant general in June 1949. His chief staff officer at Milne Bay, Colonel Fred Chilton, said he was He was known as \\"Silent\\" Cyril Clowes. In A Bastard of a Place: The Australians in Papua, Australian historian Peter Brune explained why; Clowes died on 19 May 1968 at Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg, Melbourne.

Sherrer served two terms as Oklahoma Secretary of the Environment under Republican Governors Frank Keating (1995-1997) and Mary Fallin (2011-2013). Sherrer also served as Oklahoma Secretary of Agriculture under Democratic Governor David Walters from 1989 to 1995. Early life Sherrer is a graduate of Southeastern Oklahoma State University.http://durantdemocrat.com/news/local- news-1/285/gary-sherrer-to-lead-rei-board He was a Democratic member of the Oklahoma House of Representatives from 1981 to 1989. After leaving the Legislature, Sherrer served as Director of Legislative and Regulatory Affairs for the Oklahoma Farmers Union and then worked for the Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives. Cabinet secretary Walters administration Governor David Walters appointed Sherrer to serve as the State's first Oklahoma Secretary of Agriculture. Walters also appointed him to concurrently as the Commissioner of the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture. He served in both of those positions from 1991 until the end of Walter's term in 1995. Keating administration In 1995, Walters choose not to seek re-election as governor. Frank Keating was elected to succeed him in that position. Keating asked Sherrer to stay on in his Administration. However, instead of Agriculture Secretary, Keating appoint Sherrer to serve as his Oklahoma Secretary of the Environment. In addition to his services as Secretary, the Oklahoma Water Resources Board appointed him to serve as their Executive Director. Sherrer served in both of those positions until he resigned to return to the private sector in 1997. Governor Keating appointed Brian C. Griffin to succeed Sherrer as Secretary. Fallin administration Following the election of Republican Mary Fallin as governor in 2010, Fallin appointed Sherrer to her Taskforce on Economic Development to advise her on matter related to the economy. He served in that position from the entire transition process between Fallin's election in November 2010 and her inauguration in January 2011. On January 14, 2011, Governor Fallin announced that she had selected Sherrer to serve as her Oklahoma Secretary of the Environment in her Cabinet. While serving in the Fallin Administration, Sherrer led negotiations between Oklahoma and Arkansas to protect the quality of the scenic rivers running through both states. Sherrer oversaw the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation's efforts to protect the Lesser Prairie Chicken, which avoided the need to place the animal under the protections of the Endangered Species Act by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Sherrer also oversaw the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality as it returned to compliance with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. The compliance measures allowed the state to regain control over water quality in the state rather than the Environmental Protection Agency. After two and a half years as Environmental Secretary, Sherrer resigned his position to return to private life. Private sector Following his resignation, Sherrer went to work for KAMO, a Vinita, Oklahoma-based power provider for northeast Oklahoma and southeast Missouri. He served as that organization's chief administrative officer and assistance chief executive officer. Sherrer currently serves as assistant vice president for external relations in Oklahoma State University‚Äôs Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. He also serves on the board of directors at Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc., a provider of economic development services to rural Oklahomans.

The mine is located on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada at about elevation, east of Markleeville and southeast of Lake Tahoe. The mine site comprises approximately of land surrounded by the Toiyabe National Forest, which is only accessible a few months a year. The approximately 22 million tons of sulfur ore-containing crushed rock at the mine http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha/leviathanmine/lev_p2.html are responsible for contaminating the Leviathan and Aspen Creek, which join with Mountaineer Creek to form Bryant Creek which ultimately empties into the East Fork of the Carson River. These water bodies are listed as 303(d) impaired. The site location is seismically active. Mining history Pre-open pit mining began in 1863 by Comstock Lode miners. Between 1863 and 1870, 500 tons of copper sulfate was removed from two adits. This copper sulfate was used for silver ore refining. A large sulfur deposit was discovered in one of the adits and the mine was subsequently abandoned.Schoen, C., B. Warden, and D. Henrioulle-Henry. 1995. Leviathan Mine 5-Year Workplan. Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board. Between 1935 and 1941 Calpine Corporation of Los Angeles, which subleased the mine from the Texas Gulf Sulfur Company, conducted subsurface sulfur mining and recovered 5,000 tons of sulfur. Mining was suspended in 1941 due to the hazardous nature of mining sulfur underground.Taxer, E.J. J.J. Churchill, and R.S. Gill. 1991. A History of the Leviathan Mine Pollution Abatement Project. California Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board. In 1945 the Siskon Mining Corporation, acquired the mine.California Division of Mines and Geology, 1977, p. 35\\"Leviathan NRDA Plan Final, http://www.fws.gov/sacramento/ec/Leviathan%20NRDA%20Plan%20Final.pdf\\" Open-pit mining of sulfur was initiated at the site when Anaconda Copper Mining Company purchased the Leviathan in 1951. The extracted sulfur was used for copper ore processing at Anaconda Copper Mine (Nevada). During its excavating operations and Leviathan (1953‚Äì1962), Anaconda turned the original mine into a , pit, and removed approximately 500,000 long tons of sulfur. During this time period acid mine drainage (AMD) began contaminating Leviathan Creek. In 1963, Anaconda sold the property to founders of the Alpine Mining Enterprises, Zella N. Mann and William Chris Mann, who was the Alpine County Clerk. Post-mining clean-up Site cleanup began with the 1983-1985 formation of the Leviathan Mine Pollution Abatement Project by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (LRWQCB) which was built in an effort to mitigate acid mine drainage. The State of California acquired Leviathan from Alpine Mining Enterprises in 1984, and the California State Water Resources Control Board gained jurisdiction over the property. The Leviathan Mine Pollution Abatement Project consisted of building drains beneath the pit to capture contaminated water and making evaporation ponds, filling and regrading the pit, and separating uncontaminated surface water from AMD groundwater. Results of the project include the discovery of unknown acidic springs and accidental AMD discharge directly into Leviathan Creek via a drain line. In 1997 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) became involved in the cleanup of Leviathan Mine at the request of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California. The tribe had concerns about overflow from evaporation ponds onto downstream tribal lands and the impacts of AMD on their cultural and natural resources. The EPA Region IX tried unsuccessfully to use a lime neutralization treatment of the AMD.Mayer, K. 2001. Memorandum to Keith A. Takata, Director, Superfund Division, Request for Approval of Removal Action at the Leviathan Mine, Alpine County, CA (Removal Action Memorandum). RPM, Site Cleanup Branch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX. June 29. In 1998, the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), who purchased Anaconda in 1977, was issued an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) by the EPA that obligated them to aid in the mitigation of AMD flow into Leviathan creek.EPA. 1998. Administrative Order on Consent for Removal Action, In re Leviathan Mine, Alpine County, California (ARCO Environmental Remediation, L.L.C.). Docket No. 98-07. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX. May 11. However, due to the use of unproven technologies implemented by ARCO Environmental Remediation, L.L.C. and the logistical challenges of getting supplies to the mine this effort had limited success. Then in 1999, a biphasic neutralization water treatment plant was established by the LRWQCB to treat AMD in the evaporation ponds and minimize over flow into Leviathan Creek. In 1999 the EPA proposed making Leviathan's open-pit sulfur mine a superfund site by adding it to the National Priorities List for hazardous waste sites.http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text- idx?c=ecfr&tpl;=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40cfr300_main_02.tpl In 2000 EPA added the mine to the NPL, and had the written support of the Washoe Tribe, Alpine County, California, the State of Nevada, Douglas County, Nevada and the Carson River Conservancy District. The LRWQCB was issued an Administrative Abatement Action (AAA) in 2000 (which was renewed in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb6/water_issues/projects/leviathan_project/docs/final2007_yearendreport.pdf) by the EPA in order to continue the biphasic treatment, water quality monitoring and other actives.EPA. 2001.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water. http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/criteria/cadmium/cad2001upd.pdf Since 2005, the involvement of the LRWQCB is determined by the EPA Remedial Project Manager for the mine. In 2000, a unilateral administrative order was issued to ARCO, in which the EPA required ARCO to conduct early response actions and develop a long-term response plan for mitigating AMD. In 1993 the State of California set up a pilot scale one-cell bioreactor with manure substrate for AMD treatment at Leviathan Creek Seep. By 1998, researchers from the University of Nevada-Reno (UNR) installed a two cell bioreactor at Aspen seep. By 2001, the Aspen seep bioreactor treated 2.5 million gallons of ARD. The design evolved over time and in 2003, at the behest of the State of California, ARCO and the UNR researchers developed a compost-free sulfate reducing bioreactor at Aspen Seep.http://www.epa.gov/aml/tech/leviathan.pdf Environmental damage Sulfuric acid is produced at the open-pit mine when water, such as rain, snow melt or groundwater, interacts with the waste rock. This sulfuric acid leaches contaminants from surrounding rock, such as arsenic, copper, nickel, zinc, chromium, aluminum and iron. This acid rock drainage ARD, with a low pH, and high concentrations of dissolved sulfate and metals, flows into the surrounding watershed and has adverse effects on water quality through deposition of metal-rich precipitates, which cascade through the ecosystem affecting algae, insect, and fish. The site is unvegetated and is susceptible to erosion due to several long steep slopes. The instability resulting from the open-pit mine has resulted in several landslides, with one affecting over . Human health concerns Contact with contaminates from the mine can result in both cancerous and non-cancerous health effects depending on where, when, and how long the exposure occurred. Arsenic poses the most significant health risk to exposed individuals via contact with contaminated surface water and sediment. Other risks for exposure include eating fish, plants and wild game collected near the mine, inhalation of dust near the mine, and or eating animals raised near Leviathan. In general, avoiding contact with mine tailings, surface water, and sediments in Leviathan, Aspen, and Bryant creeks, as well as the River Ranch Irrigation channel will reduce contaminate exposure and therefore reduce health risks. Biphasic neutralization water treatment  Biphasic neutralization water treatment is a two-step process. Phase I raises the pH of the outflow to the point that iron precipitates out of solution as ferric hydroxide and arsenic co-precipitates with the ferric hydroxide. This sludge is then removed and disposed of at an appropriate hazardous waste facility. In Phase II the pH of the effluent is raised again and additional metals precipitate. Much of this sludge is non- hazardous and is stored at Leviathan. The remaining wastewater can then be discharged into Leviathan Creek.LRWQCB. 2000. 2000 Year-End Report for Leviathan Mine, Alpine County, California. Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board.

The solution is reduced from sulfate to sulfide in Bioreactor No. 1, which is lined with 60-millimeter high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and filled with river rocks, which aid in the flow of effluent. The sulfide effluent is passed into Bioreactor No. 2 for additional metal removal. Next, sodium hydroxide is added to the effluent to increase the pH to neutral, and it is sent through two settling ponds (to allow for the settling of metal sulfide precipitates) and a rock-lined aeration channel for degassing of hydrogen sulfide. At the end of the aeration channel the effluent is released into Aspen Creek.

This form of art rooted in hoary antiquity, is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jewelry-making, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lacing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the culture and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very popular there.

Ornament on Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhchivan, the 12th century Seizure of Caucasian Albania by Arabs in the 7th century was of great importance in further development of visual arts. Muslim ‚Äì Iranian and Arabic cultures began to spread in the territory of modern Azerbaijan. Construction of mosques, mausoleums, castles and other cultic architectural monuments was followed by their decoration with various patterns and ornaments, calligraphic elements (epitaph), tile and bas- reliefs. Restriction of images of alive beings by Islam stimulated development of ornamental forms of decorative arts. Ornaments on Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhchivan, constructed in the epoch of the Seljuq Atabeg' reign and khanegah on the shore of the Pirsaat River are interesting monuments of that time. \\"Divankhana\\". A fragment of a decoration. Palace of the Shirvanshahs in Baku, the 15th century Set of small states appeared in the territory of Azerbaijan after weakening of Arab Caliphate. Local art schools were opened in cities such as Barda, Shamakhi, Beylagan, Ganja, Nakhchivan and Shabran. Architectural schools of Nakchivan, Shirvan-Absheron and Tabriz are the most important among them. Monuments and constructions of \\"Nakhchivan school\\" are distinguished for their ceramic details, which initially were one-colored, but then became multi-colored. Ornamental motifs generally consisted of baked brick and tile. Smooth stone walls with plastics which were rarely used in architectural elements, belong to \\"Shirvan-Absheron architectural school\\". Patterns of stone carving art, geometric and plant ornaments take an important place in buildings belonging to this architectural school.

Ceramic items found out during archeological excavations in Shabran and Baylagan also give evidence of the high-level development of visual arts in the Middle Ages. 15th century Azerbaijani rugs Azerbaijani rugs are a product of Azerbaijan, an ancient center of carpet weaving. Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery and ceramics, and last but not least carpet- weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Development of carpet weaving boosted after Ismail I's takeover of Safavid dynasty. Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. The true scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of Latif Karimov, a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, i.e. Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz. The Karabakh carpet is one of five major regional groups of carpets made in Azerbaijan named after the Karabakh region, which comprises present Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent lowland territories ('lowland Karabakh'). The Karabakh carpets amount to 33 compositions. Due to the specifics of the local sheep wool the Karabakh carpets are characterized by thick pile, high and fluffy. These carpets are marked for their vivid and joyous colors. They are divided into four groups: without medallions, with medallions, namazlyk and subject carpet. In the mountainous part of Karabakh the carpets were made in Malybeili, Muradkhanly, Dashbulakh, Jebrail, Goradis and many other villages.

Traces of this now ancient style created by artists worked in workshops of Rashidaddin in the beginning of the 14th century can be observed in miniatures created by Abdul-Bagi Bakuvi, Baku artist of the 15th century. Illustrations for \\"Anthology of the Eastern poetry\\" or \\"Anthology of Shamakhi\\" of 1468 and saved in British Museum in London are the best miniatures created by artist of Shamakhi and Baku. One-figured and two-figured portraits painted by Abdulbagi Bakuvi (\\"Stableman\\" and \\"Two amirs\\") and saved in Topkapi Museum, in Istanbul belong to miniature art of Baku. Influence of Far Eastern painting can be felt in creativity of many miniature artists of that time. Wars between Turkey and Iran and also feudal wrangles among khanates adversely affected development of visual arts in 17th-18th centuries. But colorful masterpieces of visual arts had been continuing created and the Palace of Shaki Khans built by architect Khadali Zeynalabdin from Shiraz in 1797, is one of these masterpieces. These decorative paintings created by masters such as Abbasgulu, Usta Gambar Garabaghi, Aligulu, Gurban Ali, Shukur and others were created with bright and motley colors. Images of people and animals, and also battle and hunting scenes were painted on the walls of the palace. Monumental constrictions, generally was suffering a decline. In the XVIII, wall paintings which mainly consisted of compositions of plant motifs appeared in houses of wealthy townsmen. National arts created ornaments for guns and jars. A copper jar and gun found out in Lahij has highly artistic ornaments.

Tree of life by Usta Gambar Karabakhi. From the 19th century to early 20th century several artists of decorative arts who hadn't got artistic education famed. Mir Mohsun Navvab who hadn't any artistic education and also famed as a poet, music theorist and calligraphist was among the most famous artists of that time. Ornaments created by him are important in art sphere. Ornamental wall paintings, images of flowers and birds, illustrations to his own manuscripts (\\"Bahr-ul Khazan\\" (The sea of sorrow), 1864) are typical of his creativity. Usta Gambar Garabaghi used national traditions of wall-painting (1830s-1905). He famed for his works in restoration of the Palace of Shaki Khans, paintings in interiors of houses of Mehmandarov and Rustamov in Shusha and other cities. Paintings made by him didn't break flatness of walls, but emphasized its architectural details. His new works distinguished for growth of realistic features. Landscapes, images of flowers and patterns of decorative-applied art made by poet Khurshidbanu Natavan should also be noted. She also decorated her poems with lyric art motifs.–ñ–∏–≤–æ–ø–∏—Å—å –ê–∑–µ—Ä–±–∞–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω–∞ Artists such as Avazali Mughanli (\\"Kalila and Dimna\\", 1809), Mirza Aligulu (\\"Shahnameh\\", 1850), Najafgulu Shamakhili (\\"Yusuf and Zulaikha\\", 1887) and others were famed among Azerbaijani miniature painters of that time. Easel painting New progressive visual arts of Azerbaijan faced a delay in development in the 19th century. Development of realistic easel painting was extremely low. Origination of easel painting in Azerbaijani visual arts began in this period, but works of that period such as portraits painted in Irevan \\"were still firmly connected to traditions of the eastern miniature of middle ages\\". A painter Mirza Gadim Iravani, who also hadn't got professional artistic education mainly famed as a portrait artist. \\"Dancer\\", \\"Dervish\\", \\"Strongman\\" and \\"Cavalryman\\" are his most popular works. His works are saved in National Art Museum of Azerbaijan. Portrait of a young man, portrait of a sitting woman and others are among these works. Irevani, whose works were firmly connected to traditions of the eastern miniature of medieval ages, laid down the foundations of the realistic easel painting in Azerbaijan. Paintings in Sardar's Palace in Irevan and also portraits of \\"Fath Ali Shah\\", \\"Abbas Mirza\\", \\"Mah Talat khanim\\" and \\"Vajullah Mirza\\" are among famous works of Mirza Gadim Iravani. Beside these portraits he also painted a portrait of \\"Unknown warrior\\". The palace was demolished in 1914 and four great portraits on the walls of the palace and also paintings on the walls of houses in Shusha were also erased. \\"Timur's portrait\\" by Mir Mohsun Navvab painted with watercolors in 1902 and now saved in National Art Museum of Azerbaijan in Baku is also famous. Genres of satiric graphics were appeared with publishing of \\"Molla Nasraddin\\" magazine in the beginning of the 20th century and development of book publishing. Artists of the magazine such as O.Schemrling, I.Rotter, A.Azimzade and K.Musayev actively worked in this sphere of arts.

Bahruz Kangarli is the first Azerbaijani artist who got incomplete professional education (1926), being one of the founders of realistic easel arts of Azerbaijan, created landscapes such as \\"Ilanly Mountain under the moonlight\\", \\"Before the dawn\\" and \\"Spring\\". He also created portraits of unfortunate people in \\"Refugees\\" series and everyday life compositions \\"Matchmaking\\" and \\"Wedding\\". His album \\"Memory of Nakchivan\\" consistsing of twenty landscapes is saved in National Art Museum of Azerbaijan. Kangarli drew outlines of costumes for \\"Deadmen\\" (J.Mammadguluzadeh), \\"Haji Gara\\" (M.F.Akhundov), \\"Peri Jaud\\" (A.Hagverdiyev) and other plays staged in Nakhchivan, in 1910.

Meetings dedicated to the conservation of historical monuments were held in the museum. At that time the magazine ' was issued by Ali bey Huseynzade, the eminent philosopher, journalist and artist of that time and pioneer of the art of oil painting in Azerbaijan. Huseynzade's most famous works are \\"Bibi-Heybat Mosque\\" and the \\"Portrait of the Sheikh ul-Islam.\\" Soviet Azerbaijan New type of arts was forming in Azerbaijan after establishment of the Soviet regime in Azerbaijan, in 1920.

Illustrations to books of Azerbaijani and foreign writers were made. Placards to actual themes of that time were also made. In 1928, the first art exhibition of Azerbaijani Union of Young Artists was held. In the 1930s, exhibition of Azerbaijani Union of Revolutionary Visual Arts achieved a great success. In 1932, the Committee of Azerbaijani Artists was created. In that period, works such as \\"Grape harvesting\\" by S.Sharifzade, \\"Azim Azimzade's portrait\\" by H.Hagverdiyev and \\"Portrait of Nizami Ganjavi\\" by Gazanfar Khaligov, were famous. Works by Mikayil Abdullayev, B.Mirzazade, B.Aliyeva, Sattar Bahlulzade and K.Khanlarova should also be mentioned. The first congress of Azerbaijani artists was held in 1940. Generally, political placards and satiric caricatures were made during World War II. Well-known artists as H.Khaligov, I.Akhundov, A.Hajiyev and S.Sharifzade were authors of such politic placards. For You, Humanity! by Tahir Salahov. 1961 Maturity stage in Azerbaijani visual arts began in the mid 1950s. Mikayil Abdullayev, Tahir Salahov, Vidadi Narimanbekov, Sattar Bahlulzade, Togrul Narimanbekov, Geysar Kashiyeva and others were famous artists of the Soviet Azerbaijan, in the second half of the 20th century. Tahir Salahov credited for pioneering a version of \\"severe realism\\" more truthful to the grim realities of workers' lives than the bright certainties of Socialist Realism. B.Aliyev, I.Feyzullayev, A.Mammadov, A.Verdiyev and others portrayed subjects of labor and industry in their works. But the works of Elbey Rzaguliyev, T.Sadighzade, Arif Huseynov, K.Najafzade and others are dedicated to historic past, traditions and customs of Azerbaijani people, to war and peace. J.Mirjavadova, N.Rahmanova, K.Ahmadova, G.Yunusova, S.Veysova, A.Ibrahimova, I.Mammadova, S.Mirzazade, F.Hashimova, F.Gulamova, A.Samadova and others painted mythological images.

As wrote Teymur Daimi in 2001 for the cataloque of international exhibition and published in English and French in Strasbourg in 2012. Activization integrative processes in culture. Joining the Council of Europe, creating the Azerbaijan State Art Academy, carrying out large-scale events, new art-groups as \\"Wings of time\\" (after disbanded of which the core and main cast of which formed the Yarat contemporary art space in November in 2012 that creates a platform for Azerbaijani art, both nationally and internationally.). Maiden Tower International Art Festival has been organized since 2010 with the view of the global promotion of the Maiden Tower in Old City of Baku, included in UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2000 and considered the symbol of Baku. In 2012, Azerbaijan staged the 012 Baku Public Art Festival, country's first modern art festival. As of the 2000s, Fine-art photography became popular in Azerbaijan, with names such as Rena Effendi hosting exhibitions in London and New York City. In 2010, art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in Azerbaijan was added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Taking into account its socio-economic importance, Azerbaijani folk applied art, particularly carpet weaving has been the subject to the special attention of the government to preserve, study, promote and develop carpet weaving traditions of Azerbaijani people. In this regard, the Law \\"On the protection and development of carpet art of Azerbaijan\\" was adopted in December 2004, Carpet Weaver Day started to be celebrated on May 5th according to the Presidential Decree, the new building for Azerbaijan Carpet Museum designed by an Austrian architect Franz Janz in the shape of a rolled carpet was constructed between 2007 and 2014.

He became a missionary in 1851 and continued in that position until about 1860. During these years Budge served for a time as president of the Swiss Mission, as district president in Glasgow and five different districts in England, and also preached the gospel in Italy and Germany. Among other assignments, in 1855 the president of the European Mission Franklin D. Richards sent Budge to Saxony to respond to inquires about the LDS Church from Karl G. Maeser. In 1860 Budge emigrated to Utah Territory. He later moved to Bear Lake County, Idaho. From 1878 to 1880 Budge was president of the European Mission, and in 1877 as well as in 1870 to 1906 he served as president of the Bear Lake Stake.

This process differs from anaerobic denitrification not only in its insensitivity to the presence of oxygen, but also in that it has a higher potential to create the harmful byproduct nitrous oxide. Nitrogen, acting as an oxidant, is therefore reduced in a succession of four reactions performed by the enzymes nitrate, nitrite, nitric-oxide, and nitrous oxide reductases. The pathway ultimately yields reduced molecular nitrogen (N2), as well as, when the reaction does not reach completion, the intermediate species nitrous oxide (N2O). A simple denitrification reaction proceeds as: :‚àí ‚Üí ‚àí ‚Üí NO ‚Üí ‚Üí (g) The respiration reaction which utilizes oxygen as the oxidant is: : (aq) + 6 (g) ‚Üí 6 (g) + 6 Classically, it was thought that denitrification would not occur in the presence of oxygen since there seems to be no energetic advantage to using nitrate as an oxidant when oxygen is available. Experiments have since proven that denitrifiers are often facultative anaerobes and that aerobic denitrification does indeed occur in a broad range of microbial organisms with varying levels of productivity, usually lower productivity than results from purely aerobic respiration. The advantages of being able to perform denitrification in the presence of oxygen are uncertain, though it is possible that the ability to adapt to changes in oxygen levels plays a role. Aerobic denitrification may be found in environments where fluctuating oxygen concentrations and reduced carbon are available. The relative harsh environment inspires the potential of denitrifiers to degrade toxic nitrate or nitrate under an aerobic atmosphere. Aerobic denitrifiers tend to work efficiently at 25 ~ 37¬∞C and pH 7 ~ 8, when dissolved oxygen concentration is 3 ~ 5 mg/L and C/N load ratio is 5 ~ 10. Environmental impact  Wastewater treatment  Water treatment often relies on the activity of anaerobically denitrifying bacteria in order to remove nitrate from water. However, due to the absence of oxygen, nitrate cannot be fully reduced to dinitrogen, thus nitrate remains in the water or it is converted to nitrous oxide. Lingering nitrate in drinking water poses a plethora of health risks, and both nitrate and nitrous oxide have major environmental impacts. Some hazards include, carcinogenic nitrate ions in drinking water, or eutrophication caused by oxidized nitrogen seeding Algal blooms. Conversely aerobic denitrification can further reduce oxidized nitrogen in a less specialized environment. For instance, many aerobically denitrifying bacteria from the pseudomonas genus (Pm. stutzeri, Pm. mendocina and Pm. Putida) were shown to be isolated from the Liangshui river in China, and could be further used in bioaugmentation to clear contaminated water. In addition to Pseudomas, Acinetobacter sp. SYF26 was isolated from the Hei He reservoir in China. Genomic analysis revealed a napA gene encoding a periplasmic nitrate reductase, and a nirK and nirS for gene for the nitrite reductase (both enzymes needed in aerobic nitrate denitrification).  Global warming  Nitrous oxide is a 200-300 times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, accounting for 5% of the global green house gas effect. During the reduction of nitrate in wastewater treatment, nitrous oxide is only released in the absence of appropriate oxygen regulation. Some solutions to combat the release of nitrous oxide from wastewater treatment could be to use aerobically denitrifying organisms with the capacity to fully reduce nitrogen. For instance, P. Denitrificans has shown to efficiently reduce nitrate to N2 in cultured media and wastewater. Furthermore, TR2 strains of P. sturzeri and Pseudomonas sp. strain K50 were also shown to have substantially low levels of nitrous oxide production in water treatment. Thus enriching activated sludge for aerobic denitrifying bacteria can be effective in combating the global warming effects of nitrous oxide in wastewater treatment.

For research purposes, each participant is asked to self-select the silhouette that best indicates his or her current body size and the silhouette that reflects his or her ideal body size (IBS).International Journal of Eating Disorders Reliability and validity Researchers assigned six specific instructions to ask of their participants during figure selection: (1) choose your ideal figure; (2) choose the figure that reflects how you think you look; (3) choose the figure that reflects how you feel most of the time; (4) choose the figure that you think is most preferred by men; (5) choose the figure that you think is most preferred by women; and (6) pick the opposite sex figure that you find most attractive.Thompson, J.K., & Altabe, M.N. (1991). Psychometric qualities of the figure rating scale. International Journal of Eating Disorders, 10(5), 615-619. For validity analyses, the figure ratings can be transformed into the three following discrepancy measures: (1) feel minus ideal; (2) think minus ideal; and (3) feel minus think.Thompson, J.K., & Altabe, M.N. (1991). Psychometric qualities of the figure rating scale. International Journal of Eating Disorders, 10(5), 615-619. The instructions developed for these measures may be changed depending on the specific topic of research or category of observation. Depending on its goal, each research study may require a different set of reliability and validity assessments. Trends in research The figure rating scale has been used in several influential studies on body image, body satisfaction, and eating disorders, and to measure how gender, media, race, and culture affect an individual's sensitivity to his or her own physical appearance. Most research involving the figure rating scale focuses on observing body dissatisfaction. This research area also focuses primarily on the effects of gender on body dissatisfaction. In association with the figure rating scale, more research has been conducted on female body image. Studies of body dissatisfaction have shown a woman will tend to choose an ideal body size smaller than her current body size.Cororve Fingeret, M., Gleaves, D., & Pearson, C. (2004). On the Methodology of Body Image Assessment: the use of figural rating scales to evaluate body dissatisfaction and the ideal body standards of women. Body Image, 2, 207-212 This discrepancy between the two figure selections indicates body dissatisfaction. A high level of body dissatisfaction can lead to eating disorders or depression. The figure rating scale has also been used to show that the media is an important factor in body dissatisfaction.Bissell, K. L. (2004b). What do these messages really mean? Sports media exposure, sports participation, and body image distortion in women between the ages of 18 and 75. Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 81(1), 108-123.

Correlated measurements Results from figure observations have been applied to other scales in order to assess body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. These scales provide more data that can assist researchers in determining why an individual will select a particular silhouette on the figure rating scale. * The Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) assesses various aspects of eating disorders.Garner, D.M., Olmstead, M.A., & Polivy, J. (1983). Development and validation of a multidimensional eating disorder inventory for anorexia nervosa and bulimia.

(2000). Reconceptualization of body image and drive for thinness. International Journal of Eating Disorders, 28(4), 397-407. * The Body Dissatisfaction (BD) Scale consists of nine items and measures the extent to which individuals are satisfied with specific parts of the body.Bissell, K.

Journal of Communication, 54(1), 5-21. This scale has been used in conjunction with the figure rating scale in order to observe if an individual's sensitivity to a particular body part explains his or her choice of silhouette. * The Body-Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults (BESAA) consists of twenty-three statements that measure an individual's general feelings about his or her physical appearance.Jung, J., & Forbes, G.

Sex Roles, 55(1/2), 39-50. doi:10.1007/s11199-006-9058-3 * The Male Body Attitudes Scale (MBAS) consists of 24 items and assesses the three dimensions of body attitude in men (muscularity, low body fat, and height). Applied theoretical frameworks In order to properly use this type of measurement, it is important to understand how researchers have applied theoretical frameworks. This scale is most associated with body image research. Researchers conducting observations in this area will also draw on theories from psychology and communications to understand why an individual will choose a certain silhouette to represent his or her own body type. Social comparison theory suggests that an individual will compare his or her own physical appearance to the body images presented in the media.Festinger, L. (1954). A theory of social comparison processes. Human Relations, 7, 117-140. Researchers have used this theory in association with the figure rating scale.Botta, R. A. (2000).

The role of image body size, race, and familiarity on subsequent evaluations of the self. Southwestern Mass Communication Journal, 27(3), 1-33. Self-discrepancy theory distinguishes among three domains of the self: the actual self, the ideal self, and the ought self.Harrison, K., Taylor, L. D., & Marske, A. L. (2006). Women's and men's eating behavior following exposure to ideal-body images and text. Communication Research, 33(6), 507-529.Veale, D., Kinderman, P., Riley, S., & Lambrou, C. (2003).

Real women on real beauty: Self-discrepancy, internalisation of the thin ideal, and perceptions of attractiveness and thinness in Dove's Campaign for Real Beauty. International Journal of Advertising, 29(4), 643-668. doi:10.2501/S026504871020138 The individual may choose a separate silhouette for each domain of the self. Limitations Since the scale's development in 1983, alternative body image measurements have been created for research in this area. The line-drawn silhouettes provided in the scale may not provide a clear presentation of the average human body. As the silhouettes in the scale shift from very thin to very obese, the figures gain more in the middle of the body, which may not reflect the way all bodies gain weight. Some individuals may have broader shoulders or wider hips than in the images provided in the scale; therefore, participants may have a more difficult time choosing the appropriate figures to represent their physical appearances. Research has also translated this scale into computer rendered images and photographic images with real people.Swami, V., Salem, N., Furnham, A., & Tov√©e, M. J. (2008). Initial examination of the validity and reliability of the female Photographic Figure Rating Scale for body image assessment. Personality and Individual Differences, 44(8), 1752-1761. These three-dimensional images are able to depict a more realistic presentation of different body types.

It is the only case of the Hodge conjecture which has been proved for all K√§hler manifolds.  Statement of the theorem  Let X be a compact K√§hler manifold. The first Chern class c1 gives a map from holomorphic line bundles to . By Hodge theory, the de Rham cohomology group H2(X, C) decomposes as a direct sum , and it can be proven that the image of c1 lies in H1,1(X). The theorem says that the map to is surjective. In the special case where X is a projective variety, holomorphic line bundles are in bijection with linear equivalences class of divisors, and given a divisor D on X with associated line bundle O(D), the class c1(O(D)) is Poincar√© dual to the homology class given by D. Thus, this establishes the usual formulation of the Hodge conjecture for divisors in projective varieties.  Proof using normal functions  Lefschetz's original proof worked on projective surfaces and used normal functions, which were introduced by Poincar√©. Suppose that Ct is a pencil of curves on X. Each of these curves has a Jacobian variety JCt (if a curve is singular, there is an appropriate generalized Jacobian variety). These can be assembled into a family \\\\mathcal{J}, the Jacobian of the pencil, which comes with a projection map œÄ to the base T of the pencil. A normal function is a (holomorphic) section of œÄ. Fix an embedding of X in PN, and choose a pencil of curves Ct on X. For a fixed curve Œì on X, the intersection of Œì and Ct is a divisor on Ct, where d is the degree of X. Fix a base point p0 of the pencil. Then the divisor is a divisor of degree zero, and consequently it determines a class ŒΩŒì(t) in the Jacobian JCt for all t. The map from t to ŒΩŒì(t) is a normal function. Henri Poincar√© proved that for a general pencil of curves, all normal functions arose as ŒΩŒì(t) for some choice of Œì. Lefschetz proved that any normal function determined a class in H2(X, Z) and that the class of ŒΩŒì is the fundamental class of Œì. Furthermore, he proved that a class in H2(X, Z) is the class of a normal function if and only if it lies in H1,1. Together with Poincar√©'s existence theorem, this proves the theorem on (1,1)-classes.  Proof using sheaf cohomology  Because X is a complex manifold, it admits an exponential sheaf sequence :0 \\\\to \\\\underline{\\\\mathbf{Z}} \\\\stackrel{2\\\\pi i}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\stackrel{\\\\operatorname{exp}}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\mathcal{O}_X^\\\\times \\\\to 0. Taking sheaf cohomology of this exact sequence gives maps :H^1(X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X^\\\\times) \\\\stackrel{c_1}{\\\\to} H^2(X, \\\\mathbf{Z}) \\\\stackrel{i_*}{\\\\to} H^2(X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X). The group of line bundles on X is isomorphic to H^1(X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X^\\\\times). The first Chern class map is c1 by definition, so it suffices to show that i* is zero. Because X is K√§hler, Hodge theory implies that H^2(X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X) \\\\cong H^{0,2}(X). However, i* factors through the map from H2(X, Z) to H2(X, C), and on H2(X, C), i* is the restriction of the projection onto H0,2(X). It follows that it is zero on , and consequently that the cycle class map is surjective.

Partridge was the son of Edward Partridge, the first Presiding Bishop of the LDS Church, and his wife Lydia. Partridge was born in Independence, Missouri, and was less than a year old when the Latter-day Saints were driven out of that place. The family moved to Clay County, Missouri, then Caldwell County, Missouri, and then to Nauvoo, Illinois, where Partridge's father died when young Edward was about seven. Partridge arrived in Utah in 1848 and then was called on a mission to Hawaii in 1854, where he remained until 1857. In 1858, Partridge married Sarah Lucretia Clayton, a daughter of William Clayton. He later moved to Farmington, Utah, where he ran Amasa M. Lyman's farm there. In 1864, Partridge moved to Fillmore, Utah, where he was called to serve as bishop in the LDS Church. In 1877, he became a counselor to Ira N. Hinckley in the presidency of the Millard Stake which was headquartered in Fillmore. From 1882 to 1885, Partridge served as president of the Hawaiian Mission of the church. Partridge then moved to Provo so his children could study at Brigham Young Academy. He served as a counselor to Abraham O. Smoot in the Utah Stake Presidency from 1892 to 1895 and then served as president of the Utah Stake from 1895 until his own death. Partridge had married Elizabeth Buxton as a second wife in 1862. He had a total of 17 children, only 12 of whom outlived him. References *Andrew Jenson. Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia.

The phase velocity of the sound wave is viewed as a function of frequency. Hence, separation of component frequencies is measured by the rate of change in phase velocities as the radiated waves pass through a given medium. Broadband transmission method A widely used technique for determining acoustic dispersion is a broadband transmission method. This technique was originally introduced in 1978 and has been employed to study the dispersion properties of metal (1978), epoxy resin (1986), paper materials (1993) ultra-sound contrast agent (1998). In 1990 and 1993 this method confirmed the Kramers‚ÄìKronig relation for acoustic waves. Application of this method requires the measurements of a reference velocity to obtain values for the acoustic dispersion. This is accomplished by determining (usually) the speed of the sound in water, the thickness of the specimen, and the phase spectrum of each of the two transmitted ultrasound pulses.

Biography He was born on 27 March 1892 in Bedford, the seventh child of the Rev Robert Warren Stewart MA and Louisa (n√©e Smyly), both CMS missionaries in China who were then on home leave. Stewart went with his parents to their mission station in Kucheng, Fukien Province, East China, in 1893 and was with them in 1895 at a nearby hill station called Hwa-sang when they were attacked by an insurgent group, the so-called \\"Vegetarians\\", who were opposed to all foreigners, particularly missionaries. His parents were killed as were one of his brothers, Herbert (aged 6), and one of his sisters, Hilda (aged 1), and their nursemaid. Evan survived, although it is said that he was hit on the head by a rifle butt, and was rescued from the then burning house by his sister Kathleen (aged 11), who also rescued their sister Mildred (aged 13) whose leg had been slashed by a sword. His elder brothers, Arthur, Philips and James, were at school in England. The surviving children were taken to Dublin to their grandfather's large house, Gortleitragh, in Kingstown (renamed D√∫n Laoghaire in 1922), where Evan, with his brother and sisters, were brought up by their uncles and aunts. Later they were looked after by their Aunt Emily (\\"Tem\\") at her home, Brighton Lodge, in nearby Monkstown. Educated in Dublin and then as a boarder at Wellington College where he shone at Mathematics, History and in Athletics winning the English Public Schools 100 yds sprint. On leaving school in 1910, went to Hong Kong to teach at St. Paul‚Äôs College where his older brother Arthur was headmaster; this was partly to raise money to attend University. Joined \\"The Hong Kong Volunteers\\" in 1910 and was soon commissioned, thanks to his officer training in the O.T.C. at Wellington. In 1913 returned to Dublin to attend Trinity as an undergraduate, reading History. In 1915, with the war becoming ever more demanding, he felt compelled to join up before completing his degree course although, as an undergraduate, he was then exempt from military service. He was commissioned immediately and volunteered for a machine-gun regiment, the Middlesex. He served in France, was wounded twice and on one occasion returned to Dublin to convalesce. In France, briefly met his brother James, an Army padre who was killed in 1916, and later another brother, Philips who was a Major in the RAMC. By the end of the war he was a Captain, acting Major, having been \\"on active service from 1915 to 1919\\". After the trauma of trench warfare he did not feel able to resume his degree course immediately so returned to Hong Kong in 1920 to teach again at St. Paul's College. However, realizing that he would need a degree to be fully acceptable as a teacher, took an external London University Degree in History, graduating in 1925. In 1926 Trinity College granted him its Degree and the \\"right to wear the cap and gown of a graduate of the College\\" because his studies \\"had been interrupted by military service\\". In 1928 married Dorothy Sarah Lander, daughter of the Rt. Rev. G. H. Lander, Bishop of Hong Kong from 1907 to 1920 and a previous headmaster of St. Paul's College. She was the younger sister of Kathleen, his brother Arthur's wife. They had one son, Robert Michael, born in 1931. He took over as Headmaster of St. Paul's College, in succession to his brother, in 1930, and remained headmaster, with the break of wartime, until his death. When the Japanese invaded Hong Kong in 1941 he was a Major commanding the HKVDC No. 3 (Machine-Gun) Company, first on Stonecutters Island and later in the Wong Nei Chong Gap area. His actions were to result in an award of the Distinguished Service Order for which the citation noted that the successful evacuation of Stonecutters while under fire was greatly due to his powers of organization and leadership. While at Wong Nei Chong Gap, although wounded early in the fighting, he continued to command his Company with a total disregard for his own safety and suffering. After the capture of Wong Nei Chong Gap by the enemy he organized the escape with six survivors from that area and finally found his own way back alone through the enemy lines. Throughout, his conduct was an example to all of high courage and coolness. During the fighting at Wong Nei Chong Gap, his Company suffered 100% casualties in officers and over 80% in Other Ranks. Before the start of hostilities, his wife and son had been evacuated to the Philippines and then to Sydney. After the surrender on Christmas Day 1941 he was interned as a prisoner-of-war in the Argyle Street Camp. His wounds could not be properly treated and so, combined with malnutrition, he became severely ill so that on Liberation he was evacuated first to Australia and then to England to Stoke Mandeville Orthopaedic Hospital. Returned to Hong Kong in 1947, despite a \\"dropped-foot\\" resulting from an inadequately treated shrapnel wound in his spine, he reopened the St. Paul's College, which had been temporarily restarted as a co-educational school by Katie Wu. He was Chairman of the HK Inter-Schools Sport Committee, Chairman of the HK School Certificate Panel, a member of the HK University Court, a member of St. John's Cathedral Council (and a Sidesman at the Cathedral), a member of St. John's College Council, on the Government's Appeals Board and was on served other Boards. Joined the Hong Kong Regiment, the successor unit to the Hong Kong Defence Corps, and in 1950 transferred to the Home Guard and took over command from October 1954 to 1956. Led the Hong Kong Regiment's contingent in the Coronation Procession in London in 1954, chaired the committee on the history of the HKVDC and was awarded the OBE in 1955. Served as Honorary Colonel of the Hong Kong Regiment from March 1958 until his death later that year. He died at age 66 on 17 December 1958, when still Headmaster of St. Paul's College, mainly from the effects of his time as a prisoner-of-war. His very well attended memorial service was in St. John's Cathedral on 23 December and his ashes were dispersed in the ground of St. Paul's College, which had played such a large part in his life.

The molecule consists of two thiol groups and linked via a pair of amide groups.Clarke D, Efficacy of a Novel Chelator for Mercury Chelation and Distribution, Dissertation, Arkansas State University, December 2012  Preparation  The compound was reported in about 1994 after a search for chelating agents selective for mercury. It was licensed in 2006 to CTI Science with the long-term goal of using BDTH2 in mercury poisoning. This compound is prepared by treating isophthaloyl dichloride with two equiv of cysteamine: :Isophthaloyl dichloride + 2√ócysteamine ‚Üí BDTH2  Use   Environmental remediation  BDTH2 can be used to chelate heavy metals like lead, cadmium, copper, manganese, zinc, iron, and mercury from ground water, coal tailings, gold ore, waste water of battery-recycling plants, and contaminated soil. BDTH2 appears to bind mercury more strongly than do other chelators. The mercury-BDT complex does not break down even at high pH and in the presence of cyanides, as in waste water of gold mines. The particular stability of the mercury bond can be attributed to the linear position of the two thiols.Lisa Y. Blue, Mike A. Van Aelstyn, Matthew Matlock, David A. Atwood, Low-level mercury removal from groundwater using a synthetic chelating ligand, Water Research, Vol. 42, Issues 8-9, April 2008, pp2025-2028 The company Covalent Research Technologies had investigated BDTH2 for the removal of mercury from flue gas without success.  Clinical use  Animal experiments with inorganic mercury showed, that BDTH2 effectively binds mercury in the body, and the resulting mercury derivative is excreted in the feces. Experimental animals showed no signs of poisoning. It is unclear, how the BDTH2-mercury-chelate behaves in the long term. BDTH2 is lipophilic, as opposed to DMPS and DMSA and thus can cross lipid membranes including the blood-brain-barrier and enters the bone marrow. In animal experiments, the amount of mercury in brain tissue was not increased, but also not decreased(can anyone provide a reference for the material/data/research from which this conclusion was drawn?). However, there are indications that the BDTH2-mercury-compound moves into adipose tissue. It is unknown, how BDTH2 works with methyl-mercury. BDTH2 appears to bind copper and zinc in vivo only weakly. In contrast DMPS und DMSA bind these ions more strongly. Its affinity is low for other \\"hard\\" ions, e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+. Until July 2010 CTI Science sold BDTH2 under the name OSR#1 as a nutritional supplement.Forrest Health Online: Since OSR#1 didn't fulfill criteria of a nutritional supplement, its sale was stopped under pressure of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Warning letter CIN-10-107927-14 17 June 2010 FDA to CTI Science Inc. In January 2012 BDTH2 was designated by the European Commission as an orphan drug, which guarantees CTI Science 10 years of exclusive marketing rights.EU/3/11/944 (PDF; 112 kB) NBMI as orphan drug by the EC The U.S. FDA in April 2012 also designated the compound as an orphan drughttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/OOPD_Results_2.cfm?Index_Number=367312  Potential applications  Like most thiols, BDTH2 binds to mercury salts to form thiolate complexes. In principle, it could be used to remove mercury from water for industrial applications under a wide range of conditions, including the high pH and cyanide of the effluent from gold mining. In industrial use, BDTH2 is easy to make and can be used either as-is or in the form of sodium or potassium salts that are more soluble in water. BDTH2 binds to mercury with a strong, nonpolar covalent bond within a water-insoluble organic framework. The resulting BDT‚ÄìHg precipitate is stable, and leaches mercury only under highly acidic or basic conditions. BDTH2 also binds to other elements, including arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and selenium. It is effective and economical for removing small traces of mercury from polluted soil, as the precipitate is inert and can be left in the soil after treatment.  Dietary supplement and controversy  BDTH2 had been marketed under the name OSR#1 as a dietary supplement for treatment of autism. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined that BDTH2 is a drug rather than a supplement and issued a warning, resulting in its removal from the market. The main proponent of the compound, Dr. Boyd Haley, was chairman of the department of chemistry where research is also conducted on the utility of this compound for remediation of heavy metal pollution.

It was part of a larger genocidal Intelligenzaktion, that took place across most of Nazi-occupied western Poland in the course of Operation Tannenberg (Unternehmen Tannenberg), purposed to install Nazi officials from Sipo, Kripo, Gestapo and SD at the helm of a new administrative machine. On the direct orders of Adolf Hitler carried out by Reinhard Heydrich's bureau of Referat Tannenberg along with Heinrich Himmler's SS-RSHA (Main Security Office), Poles from among intelligentsia and elites were rounded up, and executed without any due process by the SS-Einsatzgruppen in dozens of remote locations such as the forest massacres in Pia≈õnica and the cavernous Valley of Death. Starting right after the invasion in September 1939, with a second wave in the spring of 1940, these actions were an early measure of the German Generalplan Ost colonization.Prof. Dietrich Eichholtz (2004), ¬ªGeneralplan Ost¬´ zur Versklavung osteurop√§ischer V√∂lker. PDF file, direct download 74.5 KB.  Background  After the Nazi invasion of Poland, the ethnically Polish and Kashubian population of Polish Pomerania was immediately subjected to brutal terror.Jerzy Lukowski, Hubert Zawadzki, A concise history of Poland, Cambridge concise histories, Concise Histories Series, Cambridge University Press, 2001, pg. 228, Poles were seen by German state during the war as subhuman. Prisoners of war,Jochen B√∂hler, \\"Zbrodnie Wehrmachtu w Polsce\\" (Warcrimes of Wehrmacht in Poland), Wydawnictwo Znak, Krak√≥w, 2009, pg 183‚Äì192 as well as many Polish intellectuals and community leaders were murdered. Many of the crimes were carried out, with official approval, by the so-called Einsatzkommando 16 and \\"Selbstschutz\\", or paramilitary organizations of ethnic Germans with previously Polish citizenship. They in turn were encouraged to participate in the violence and pogroms by the local Gauleiter Albert Forster,Dieter Schenk, Hitlers Mann in Danzig Gauleiter Forster und die NS-Verbrechen in Danzig-Westpreu√üen, J. H. W. Dietz Nachf. Verlag, Bonn 2000, , ‚Äì Polish translation Dieter Schenk \\"Albert Forster gda≈Ñski namiestnik Hitlera.

Organized action aimed at exterminating the Polish population of the region, however, began only after the end of the September campaign, with the Intelligenzaktion Pommern, a part of an overall Intelligenzaktion by Nazi Germany aimed at liquidating the Polish elite. Its main targets were the Polish intelligentsia, which was blamed by the Nazis for pro-Polish policies in the Polish corridor during the interwar period. Educated Poles were also perceived by the Nazis as the main obstacle to the planned complete Germanization of the region.  Prepared list of targets  Poles and Jews interned in Bydgoszcz Even before the Nazi invasion of Poland, German police and Gestapo cooperated with the German minority in Poland to prepare special lists of Poles \\"Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen\\" whom they regarded as representative of the Polish government, administration, culture, and life in the region. People on this list were called \\"The enemies of Reich\\" and were designated to be executed. According to official criteria, the Polish \\"intelligentsia\\" included anyone with a middle school or higher education, priests, teachers, doctors, dentists, veterinarians, veteran military officers, bureaucrats, members of Polish administration, police, medium and large businessmen and merchants, medium and large landowners, writers, journalists and newspaper editors. Furthermore, all persons who during the interwar period had belonged to many Polish cultural and patriotic organizations such as Polski ZwiƒÖzek Zachodni or Polish Union of the West, ZwiƒÖzek Obrony Kres√≥w Zachodnich, Polish Gymnastic Society \\"Falcon\\" and Maritime and Colonial League. Between the fall of 1939 and spring of 1940, in the Intelligenzaktion and other actions, the Nazis killed around 100,000 Polish intellectuals and other prominent citizens, 61,000 of whom came from special lists. The main site of these murders were the forests around Wielka Piasnica.  Method of realisation  The action was realised by SS paramilitary death squads ‚Äì Einsatzcommando 16 and the paramilitary organisation of the German minority in Poland ‚Äì Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz.Andrzej Szcze≈õniak: Generalplan Ost. Plan Zag≈Çady S≈Çowian. Radom: Polskie Wydawnictwo Encyklopedyczne, 2001, . The aim of this action was elimination of Polish society elite: Polish nobles, intelligentsia, teachers, Polish entrepreneurs, social workers, military veterans, members of national organisations, priests, judges and political activists.  Locations  Polish teachers from Bydgoszcz guarded by members of Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz before execution Most executions of this regional action took place in forests near Pia≈õnica Wielka, Mniszek near ≈öwiecie and in the Szpƒôgawski forests near Starogard Gda≈Ñski. Local Germans (Selbstschutz) and the Gestapo murdered 5,000 ‚Äì 6,600 Poles and Jews in October and November 1939 in Fordon, Bydgoszcz, northern Poland in a place known as the \\"Fordon Valley of Death\\" ().Konrad Ciechanowski [et al.]: Stutthof: hitlerowski ob√≥z koncentracyjny.

Jacobs made his voice acting debut in 1999 with an uncredited role in Full Blast. He began his role of King Julien in The Penguins of Madagascar (2008‚Äì2015) and had reprised his role in the Christmas special Merry Madagascar (2009), the Valentine's Day special Madly Madagascar (2013), and All Hail King Julien (2014‚Äì2017). He also impersonated Baron Cohen's character Borat Sagdiyev (as well as a cameo appearance as a Pirate with an Eye Patch) in Epic Movie (2007). Besides King Julien, his voice work includes the role of Rowdy Remington in Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil (2010‚Äì2012), Victor Zsasz in Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009) and Batman: Arkham City (2011), Special Agent Porter in Justice League: Doom (2012), Snake / Snakeweed in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012), Grifter / Captain Cold in Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013), Baron Mordo in Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister 6 (2016), and Heinrich Zemo in Avengers: Ultron Revolution (2016). Career In 1993, Jacobs originated the role of Chico Fern√°ndez in Jeff Daniels' comedy The Vast Difference at the Purple Rose Theatre. In 1996‚Äì97, he won acting awards in Michigan, Florida, and Wisconsin for his portrayal of Aram in Richard Kalinoski's \\"Beast on the Moon.\\" In 1999, Jacobs landed an uncredited voice role as Curt in Full Blast. In the same year, he appeared in his first live-action role in Get the Hell Out of Hamtown. In 2003, he began to tour the nation with \\"Triple Espresso: A Highly Caffeinated Comedy.\\" Jacobs portrayed Borat Sagdiyev and made a cameo appearance as a Pirate with an Eye Patch in Epic Movie (2007). When portraying the role of Borat, Jacobs did an impression of Sacha Baron Cohen. In 2008‚Äì2015, Jacobs was a substitute for Baron Cohen as the voice of King Julien in The Penguins of Madagascar, again as an impression of Baron Cohen (Jacobs also provided additional voices in the series). In 2011, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for the role. Jacobs reprised his role in Merry Madagascar (2009) and Madly Madagascar (2013). In 2014‚Äì2017, he returned to the role in All Hail King Julien. In Penguins of Madagascar (2014), Jacobs once again reprised his role as King Julien. He had also done voice-overs in various commercials. In addition to the jobs that led to All Hail King Julien, Jacobs had been doing voice-over work for animated television series, including Phineas and Ferb (in which he provided additional voices) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (in which he voiced Snake / Snakeweed), as well as several video games. He had said that animation, much like the theatre, gives actors a chance to play a wide range of roles. He said, \\"I can play any character of any ethnicity, any age, even any gender. And that's a freedom the camera doesn't give you. It's an incredibly freeing thing.\\" He also stated that King Julien is his favorite voice role and would gladly reprise his role if ever asked. Jacobs had received more recognition as King Julien than the character's predecessor Baron Cohen. In Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012), Jacobs provided the singing voice of King Julien for the soundtrack. He had a voice role in Teen Titans Go! as George Washington. Personal life On July 13, 2015, Jacobs donated to Kids Kicking Cancer and had entertained some children with his King Julien voice.https://www.mlive.com/entertainment/detroit/index.ssf/2015/07/post_138.html Awards and nominations Jacobs was nominated for the 2010 Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Television Production for his voice role of King Julien in Merry Madagascar (2009), but lost the award to Tom Kenny.

The conflict between two older men with different mindsetsRamadasu (an eternal, devious debtor) and Mukundarao (a generous, rich gentleman with fake prestige)is the film's centrepiece. Production began after the success of Mayabazar (1957), with M. S. Chalapathi Rao and Jagannadham the film's executive producers. Marcus Bartley was the director of photography. S. Rajeswara Rao composed the soundtrack and background score. G. Kalyanasundaram and K. Radhakrishna edited the film, and Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were its art directors. The film is shown almost entirely in black and white, with the exception of a dance sequence filmed in Gevacolor. Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was released on 14 January 1959, during the Makar Sankranti festival season. With average returns during its first four weeks, the film eventually became an above-average grosser and its re-release was profitable. It has cult status in Telugu cinema, and is an acclaimed Prasad film. Goldstone Technologies announced that they would attempt to digitise the film in 2007, but abandoned the attempt three years later.  Plot  Rao Bahadur Ramadasu, a devious zamindar, is a perennial debtor who believes in leading a luxurious life on credit. His shrewd, schizophrenic manager Bhaja Govindam placates angry creditors with false promises. Dewan Bahadur Mukunda Rao, a wealthy, generous zamindar, is searching for a royal bridegroom for his granddaughter Manjari. Ramadasu plans to marry his son Raghu, a doctor practising in London, to Manjari to pay his debts. Unknown to his father, though, Raghu has married a woman named Leela. Ramadasu first bribes Rao's manager, Ramalingam. Rao, unaware of the deception, agrees to the alliance. Manjari, who knows the truth, wants to stop the marriage. Leela's brother, Raja, is released from prison after serving a sentence for his participation in the Indian independence movement. Raja and Manjari were lovers during their college days, and she tells him about Ramadasu's intentions. After Raghu arrives from London, Ramadasu misleads him into thinking that Leela has died. When Raja asks Ramadasu to spare Leela, he sends mobsters to attack him. Raja overpowers them, cornering Ramadasu later, and Leela stays in his home disguised as a mute maid. Govindam, fed up with Ramadasu, wants to expose his dishonesty to his creditors. Govindam's relationship with Ramalingam's daughter, Usha, is strained. Ramalingam's attempts to marry her off are thwarted by Govindam. To reunite Leela and Raghu, Raja disguises himself as Prince Bonkulamarri Raja and enters Rao's house aided by Govindam's schizophrenia. Rao is impressed with Raja and considers him a suitable bridegroom for Manjari, who is aware of and supports Raja's plans. Raghu recognises Leela and is affectionate to her, which bothers Ramadasu. Despite his opposition to his father's intentions, Raghu continues to flirt with Manjari and play the prospective bridegroom. Raja and Govindam use a number of disguises in an attempt to expose Ramadasu's greed. Raghu introduces a foreign woman to Ramadasu as his demanding wife, who forces his father to incur more debt until he is cornered by his creditors. Ramalingam's deception is exposed, and Ramadasu apologises for his misdeeds. Raghu and Leela reconcile; Raja marries Manjari, and Govindam marries Usha.  Cast  *N. T.

V. Reddy, B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios planned to make a contemporary film. Chakrapani came up with an idea about conflict between two older men who are polar opposites: one a debtor evading his creditors, and the other a wealthy gentleman with an inflated sense of prestige. L. V. Prasad was chosen to direct the film; he, Chakrapani and Vempati Sadasivabrahmam developed a script entitled Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, after a popular Telugu idiom. It was the only film from Vijaya Vauhini Studios with dialogue written by Sadasivabrahmam. Film historian Randor Guy opines that Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was a Telugu remake of Prasad's Tamil film Kadan Vaangi Kalyaanam (1958). Others such as Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen (authors of Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema), film scholar Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai, and M. L. Narasimhan of The Hindu believe that they were filmed simultaneously with different casts for different versions. Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass wrote the dialogue for Kadan Vaangi Kalyaanam, and M. S. Chalapathi Rao and Jagannadham were the film's executive producers.  Casting and filming  N. T. Rama Rao and Savitri were chosen for the lead roles, with Jaggayya, C. S. R. Anjaneyulu, S. V. Ranga Rao and Jamuna in supporting roles; Jamuna had no dialogue for most of the film. It was Rama Rao's 55th film as an actor, and Jaggayya's first film for Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Jaggayya replaced Akkineni Nageswara Rao, who bowed out due to scheduling conflicts. Jaggayya had worked with Prasad as a voice artist for the Telugu-dubbed version of the director's Manohara (1954), starring Sivaji Ganesan. Comedian Potti Prasad and Padmanabham made appearances as the prospective bridegrooms of Girija, who played Relangi fianc√©e; the former made his Telugu cinema debut with this film. Prasad, who received 1,116 for his single scene, praised Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani's generosity. Marcus Bartley was the director of photography. S. Rajeswara Rao composed the soundtrack and background score, assisted by Ogirala Ramachandra Rao and K. Prasada Rao. Ramachandra Rao's son, Narasimhamurthy, was cast as a child artiste. G. Kalyanasundaram and K. Radhakrishna edited the film, and Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were its art directors. The success of Missamma (1955) encouraged Chakrapani to include a dream sequence, \\"Damayanti Swayamvaram\\", in which Rama Rao, Savitri and Jaggayya play Nala, Damayanti and Indra. Rama Rao had to shave his signature moustache for a scene, making Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu the only contemporary film in which he is clean-shaven. Another dance scene, \\"Aathmathyagam\\", was filmed by E. V. Saroja and Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy in Gevacolor; both were choreographed by Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy. Though the film is shown almost entirely in black and white, \\"Aathmathyagam\\" alone was filmed in colour. M. Pithambaram and T. P. Bhaktavatsalam provided the make-up. Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was processed at the Vijaya Laboratory, and was recorded with the Westrex Sound System. The film's final length was .  Music  S. Rajeswara Rao composed the soundtrack of Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, which has 15 songs (including poems). Pingali Nagendrarao wrote the lyrics. Sound mixing was supervised by A. Krishnan and V. Sivaram, processed by N. C. Sen Gupta and orchestrated by A. Krishnamurthy. Ghantasala provided vocals for Rama Rao and Ramaiah, and A. M. Rajah sang for Jaggayya's portions. P. Leela, P. Susheela, and Swarnalatha provided vocals for the actresses. \\"Echatinundi Veecheno\\" was based on the Mohana raga. For \\"Sundarangulanu Choosina Velana\\" Rajeswara Rao re-used the melody of \\"Brindavanamadi Andaridi Govindudu Andarivadele\\", which he wrote for Vijaya Vauhini Studios' Missamma at Chakrapani's urging (a rare example of the composer recycling an earlier song). Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu soundtrack was released in December 1959 on the Saregama label. \\"Kaseeki Poyanu Ramahari\\", \\"Echatinundi Veecheno\\", \\"Moogavaina Emile Nagumome\\" and \\"Cheyi Cheyi Kaluparave\\" became popular over the years; \\"Cheyi Cheyi Kaluparave\\" was parodied by the Indian National Congress as part of their election campaign during the 1989 general elections. The poem \\"Nava Kala Samithi\\" and other popular songs were played by keyboardist V. Seetharamaiah at the April 2013 Ghantasala Padya Sangeetha Vibhavari event at Kalabharathi Auditorium in Visakhapatnam. Track listing  Release, reception and legacy  Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was released theatrically on 14 January 1959, during the Makar Sankranti festival season. With mediocre earnings during its first four weeks, the film became an above-average grosser. Its re-release was profitable, and it became a Telugu cult film. According to M. L. Narasimham of The Hindu, Prasad's \\"deft handling\\" made the scenes \\"flow smoothly\\" despite the number of characters but the magic of Pelli Chesi Choodu (1952) and Missamma was missing from Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu. In their Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen wrote that the film \\"stages the victory of nationalist-modern alliance over decadent feudalism\\"; Ramaiah's scenes are its \\"most remarkable sections\\", giving a \\"semblance of unity\\" to a plot they found \\"barely coherent\\". K. Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake wrote that Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, Missamma, Gundamma Katha (1962) and Ramudu Bheemudu (1964) \\"represented the scope comedy had in the 1950s and 60s.\\" In September 2006, a postage stamp commemorating Prasad was issued in Hyderabad. M. L. Narasimham, in an article about the honour, listed Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu with Shavukaru (1950), Samsaram (1950), Pelli Chesi Choodu, Manohara, Missamma and others as acclaimed films by the director after the release of Mana Desam (1949) and his association with Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was one of the popular 1950s films featuring Ramana Reddy and Relangi Venkata Ramaiah, whom film historian Punnami Ravi Chandra termed the Laurel and Hardy of Telugu cinema at the time. Relangi Narasimha Rao 2008 comedy film of the same name, starring Rajendra Prasad, was a commercial failure.  Digitisation plans  In late November 2007, Hyderabad-based Goldstone Technologies acquired the film-negative rights to 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios (including Mayabazar and Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu) to produce digitally- remastered versions in colour. Although the remastered, colourised version of Mayabazar was released in January 2010 and performed well in theatres, Goldstone decided not to remaster the remaining 13 films. According to the company, most of the producers who sold their negative rights to television networks relinquished control of them and the legal ownership and copyright issues proved insurmountable.

Due to improper waste handling and removal, the soil and groundwater beneath the property became contaminated and the area is now referred to as the Omega Chemical Superfund Site. Cleanup of the site began in 1995 with the removal of hazardous waste receptacles and a multimillion-dollar soil vaporization detoxifying system. History The Omega Chemical Corporation processed hazardous wastes from refrigerants at their facilities to be recycled into commercial products. They primarily handled hydrocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons and stored the waste at their facilities in Whittier, California. Due to leakage and improper handling, transport, and storage practices, there has been contamination of groundwater and soil by volatile organic compounds (compounds that can easily evaporate in air), and other metals. Removal activities began under the supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1995 after thousands of drums of hazardous wastes, contaminated cylinders of up to 20,000 pounds, and hundreds of contaminated, empty drums were reported at the Omega site. A CERCLA administrative order was administered to the owner of the site to begin cleanup activities and the Omega Chemical Site PRP Organized Group was formed of potentially responsible parties to carry out the orders. Over 4,000 contaminated drums were removed from the property by this group and numerous soil and groundwater samples were evaluated for toxicity. Major Contaminants  Tetrechloroethene (PCE)  Tetrachloroethene is a chemical often found in dry cleaning and degreasing agents and has been determined by the Department of Health and Human Services to likely be a carcinogen. It has been experimentally shown to cause liver and kidney tumors in mice and rats with prolonged exposure.  Trichloroethene (TCE)  Trichloroethene is a chemical commonly used as a solvent for metal cleaning and has been shown to remain in groundwater for a long time if leaked. Drinking TCE-contaminated water for a long time may cause liver and kidney damage, impaired fetal development, and possible immune system impairment. Prolonged exposure may also cause cancer.  Freons  Freons are chemicals used as coolants in refrigerators and as a pressurizing agent in aerosols. The EPA reports that prolonged exposure to small amounts of Freon is unlikely to cause adverse health effects. Risks While the majority of the Omega site is paved in concrete, direct contaminated soil contact at the site is a small risk, with the exception of exposure to construction workers who worked at the site. The greater risks lie in soil vapor exposure and groundwater contamination. Groundwater contamination is moving to the southwest from Whittier so drinking-water supply wells in the vicinity of the site and to the southwest are at risk of contamination. Multiple buildings near the site have also documented higher levels of toxic soil vapors. Cleanup Efforts The EPA proposed a cleanup plan in 2009 in order to reduce vapor intrusion risk, direct exposure risk, and migration of contaminants further down-gradient and to deeper levels. To do this, they proposed the use of Soil vapor extraction wells that remove and treat toxic vapors from the soil above the water table to keep them from contaminating the groundwater.

They used strong chemicals to recondition the drums, leading to public concern about health impacts on the surrounding community. In particular, staff and students from Tweedy Elementary School, which borders the Cooper Drum site to the south, complained of health problems that may have resulted from exposure to toxic chemical coming from Cooper Drum Company. In June 2001, the Cooper Drum site was placed on the Superfund list, marking the site as one of the most high priority toxic cleanup sites in the United States. History The Cooper Drum site is located at 9316 South Atlantic Avenue in South Gate, Los Angeles California. The site is bordered by industrial properties to the north and east, commercial/residential properties to the west, and Tweedy Elementary School to the south. The site had been used for reconditioning steel drums since 1941 by a series of recycling companies. In 1976, the site was purchased by Cooper Drum Company.EPA Cooper Drum Site Website Cooper Drum Company‚Äôs main recycling operation was reconditioning steel drums. Initially the drum reconditioning was conducted along the southern portion of the property. This was an assembly line process along an elevated concrete floor. Drums were flushed and stripped with sodium hydroxide in preparation for painting and resale. The fluids from reconditioning were transferred to two holding tanks and five clarifiers. Any solid precipitate was pumped out and transported for off-site disposal, while the liquid was reused in the conditioning process. When the drums contained solid or highly viscous material, they were subjected to hard washing. From 1976 to 1992 hard washing was conducted on the northern part of the property. During this time, hard washing consisted of placing chains and sodium hydroxide inside the drums and rolling the drums over four concrete sumps that were fitted with grates. The runoff was collected in the four sumps that were connected by open concrete trenches. In 1992, the drum reconditioning business was purchased by Waymire Drum Company resulting in a number of changes. Firstly, the hard washing operations were moved to the southern portion of the property and high pressure spraying was used in the place of chaining. Additionally, all the collection sumps and trenches, which had been open to the air were replaced with close topped steel tanks and hard piping. The tanks were placed over the sumps and hard piping over the trenches, allowing the initial sumps and trenches to serve as secondary containment for the upgraded equipment. While the Cooper Drum site was owned by Waymire Drum Company, it was fitted to process plastic totes. Since 2003, no drum processing operations have occurred, and all drum processing equipment has been removed. From 2003 to 2006 the site was used by a pallet company, a trucking and towing company, and two automotive repair and salvage companies. Health Concerns Beginning in 1986, both staff and students at Tweedy Elementary school began complaining of various health problems, including stomach aches, headaches, sore throats, and asthma.Valencia, Carmen. ‚ÄúParents Fear Foul Fumes At School Symptoms Spur Health Concerns About Nearby Industries. ‚Äò‚ÄôLos Angeles Times‚Äô‚Äô. 7 September 1986. Retrieved on 8 February 2010. Staff at Tweedy and parents of the students believed the negative symptoms were caused by exposure to toxic chemicals from nearby industries. The most notable industry was Cooper Drum Company, as it was separated from Tweedy Elementary only by a brick wall. Spurred on by popular demand, surveys and health exams of staff and students were conducted by both the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services and Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). However, these studies did not show any significantly greater health problems for the students and staff at Tweedy as compared to San Gabriel Elementary, a comparable school located in a residential neighborhood.Valencia, Carmen. ‚ÄúHealth Tests Begin for Students at Industrial-Area School‚Äù. ‚Äò‚ÄôLos Angeles Times‚Äô‚Äô 20 November 1986. Retrieved on 8 February 2010. Though the health problems of the staff and students at Tweedy Elementary could not be directly tied to Cooper Drum Co., the risks of having the elementary school next to the drum reconditioning site became apparent in April 1987. A quantity of highly caustic liquid, believed to be composed mainly of sodium hydroxide and oil, seeped underground from Cooper Drum Co. to exposed soil on the Tweedy Elementary property.

Following the study, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD), which selected the actions to take at the site. The groundwater remedy consisted of using a combination of in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) and extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater. To treat the soil, the EPA is using dual phase extraction (DPE) to protect the aquifer that lies below the site. This technique extracts contaminated soil vapors and groundwater simultaneously.

Her work has been included in The New York Times, Time Magazine and National Geographic. Life and work Sinclair was born in 1973 in Miami, FL. She graduated from the University of Florida with a B.S. in journalism and an outside concentration in fine art photography. After college, Sinclair began working for the Chicago Tribune, where she was part of the paper's 2001 Pulitzer-prize winning team in Explanatory Reporting. The Tribune sent her to cover the beginning of the war in Iraq. She later settled in Iraq and then in Beirut, Lebanon, covering the Middle East and South Asia for six years as a freelance photographer. Sinclair joined the VII Network upon its establishment in 2008, and became a full member of VII in 2009. She first encountered child marriage in 2003 while working on a project about self-immolation in Afghanistan. \\"All the victims she met had been married very young, some only 9 years old, and to much older men.\\" From 2003‚Äì2005 Sinclair photographed young Afghan women who had burned themselves. Most had been married between age 9 and 13. The result was her contribution to the 2010 Whitney Biennial exhibition, \\"Self-Immolation in Afghanistan: A Cry for Help.\\" In 2005, her work was featured on The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer in a segment called \\"Picturing Iraq.\\" The February 2010 issue of National Geographic included Sinclair's project on polygamy in America. Pictures from the series were included in The New York Times Magazine on July 27, 2008. Her photo series, Too Young to Wed, examines \\"how children continue to be forced into marriage in more than 50 countries around the world.\\" The project was the result of fifteen years of work in Afghanistan, Nepal, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Guatemala, and Yemen. In 2012, Sinclair and Jessica Dimmock made a short documentary about an Ethiopian girl married at age 11. Sinclair is the Founder and Executive Director of Too Young to Wed, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to empower girls and end child marriage globally. The organization shares a name with Sinclair's seminal body of work on child marriage, and was inspired by her years of work on the issue as a photojournalist. The organization runs on-the-ground programming through local implementing partners and awards educational scholarships to keep girls in school and out of marriage in some of the world's most vulnerable contexts. Too Young to Wed currently supports girls in Nepal, Yemen, Nigeria, and Kenya. In 2014, a collection of Sinclair's body of work was displayed in a show at the Bronx Documentary Center, a documentary photography community center based in the South Bronx founded by photojournalist and author of Photojournalists on War: The Untold Stories from Iraq, Michael Kamber. The same year, Sinclair and Jessica Dimmock were awarded the 2014 Infinity Award: Photojournalism by the International Center for Photography. In 2016, the BBC credited Sinclair for documenting efforts of some African leaders campaigning for the rights of girls at risk of forced or child-age marriage. Among others, she has documented the work of Thobeka Madiba Zuma (wife of Jacob Zuma), a First Lady of South Africa, and Esther Lungu, First Lady of Zambia are among those leading the effort.In pictures: African champions against child marriage BBC, May 26, 2016 In 2017, Sinclair's body of work on child marriage was displayed in the inaugural opening of the L'Arche du Photojounalisme, a premiere gallery that sits atop Paris' Grande Arche de la Defense. Organized by Visa pour l'Image Director Jean-Fran√ßois Leroy, the exhibition featured 175 of Sinclair's iconic images as well as six short films and educational materials on child marriage globally. 65 percent of the images featured had never been exhibited. The show honored Sinclair's documentation of child marriage in 10 countries over 15 years. Personal life In 2011, Sinclair's mother suffered a brain injury. Sinclair said: \\"When you share the experience of someone you love having a brain injury ‚Äî of becoming a different person ‚Äî there's an instant intimacy.\\" Awards Sinclair has won multiple awards and distinctions. This includes three World Press Photo awards, the 2015 Art for Peace Award, the 2015 Lucie Humanitarian Award, the International Center of Photography 2014 Infinity Award, unprecedented three Visa D'Or Feature awards from the Visa Pour L'Image photojournalism in France, UNICEF'S Photo of the Year, the Alexia Foundation Professional Grant and the Lumix Festival for Young Photojournalism Freelens Award. She has also received the 2008 CARE International Award for Humanitarian Reportage: The Overseas Press Club's Olivier Rebbot Award (2009) for her essay, 'A Cutting Tradition: Inside An Indonesian Female Circumcision Celebration'. Sinclair has also received another World Press Photo award for her coverage of the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006, and a Pulitzer Prize for her work in documenting systemic failures in the U.S. airline industry in 2000.

It was built along the same lines as the Martello towers that were constructed along the British and Irish coastlines in the early 19th century and is the last-built example of a gun tower of this type. It owed its existence to the need to protect the important dockyards at Sheerness and Chatham from a perceived French naval threat during a period of tension in the 1850s. Rapid improvements to artillery technology in the mid-19th century meant that the tower was effectively obsolete as soon as it had been completed. A proposal to turn it into a casemated fort was dropped for being too expensive. By the end of the 19th century the tower had gained a new significance as a defence against raids by fast torpedo boats. It was used in both the First and Second World Wars, when its fabric was substantially altered to support new quick-firing guns. It was decommissioned in 1956 and remains derelict today. The tower has been privately owned since 2005 and was reportedly sold to a new owner in 2014 for ¬£400,000. Context and construction Map of the fortifications at the entrance to the Medway At the time of the tower's construction, there were widespread fears that the imperial rivalry between Britain and France could result in a French invasion or naval incursion along the River Thames. The Thames was seen as particularly vulnerable; as well as being one of the UK's most important trade routes, it possessed several naval installations of great importance, including the victualling yards at Deptford, the armaments works of Woolwich Arsenal, the shipbuilding yards at North Woolwich, and the magazines at Purfleet. The Medway also had major installations, notably the Chatham Dockyard, which had been targeted to devastating effect by the Dutch during the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1667. It was thus deemed essential to prevent an enemy entering the Medway and reaching the dockyard. Grain Tower stands about offshore at the eastern tip of the Isle of Grain, where the mouth of the Medway meets the Thames. It was constructed on the tidal sandbank of Grain Spit and is reached by a causeway running in an east-west direction from the shoreline. Its location enabled the tower's arc of fire to overlap with that of the guns at Garrison Point on the Isle of Sheppey, on the other side of the Medway. 1870 view of the forts at the mouth of the Medway: (left to right) Garrison Point, Grain Tower, Grain Fort Construction began in 1848 but difficulties were soon encountered in laying the foundations and construction paused until 1853. It took nearly two years for the Lincolnshire builders Kirk and Parry to construct the rest of the tower; as the York Herald newspaper noted, \\"from the exposed situation of the tower, which is subject to the sea and weather, very great difficulties were experienced during the winter months in proceeding with the work.\\" It was completed in late 1855 and was handed over to the Ordnance authorities on 17 November that year. By this point it had gone more than 50 percent over budget, costing ¬£16,798 (equivalent to ¬£. The tower stands three storeys high, faced in granite ashlar, and is roughly oval in shape. Its base is , its original height was , and it has walls thick. The gun crews lived in barrack accommodation within the tower, which also housed stores and ammunition. Its overall design is similar to that of a Martello tower, dozens of which were built around the coasts of Britain and Ireland during the Napoleonic Wars at the start of the 19th century; it can be considered the last Martello tower to be built in Britain. Operational history The tower was initially armed with three 68-pdr. smoothbore guns which were mounted on traversing platforms on the roof and fired en barbette. Although Martello-style towers were well able to resist the smoothbore guns of the early 19th century, the development of a new generation of much more powerful rifled muzzle loader (RML) guns made Grain Tower obsolete as soon as it had been completed. The tower's weakness to fire from rifled guns was never fully addressed. A fresh invasion scare at the end of the 1850s prompted the British government to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. It recommended that many existing forts should be upgraded or rebuilt entirely, and that new forts should be constructed to guard particularly strategic or vulnerable points along the coast. In all, around 70 forts and batteries were constructed around the English coast as a result of the Royal Commission's report. The Commission recommended that Grain Tower should be turned into a fully casemated fort, which would be built around the existing structure. However, the cost of doing this was seen as excessive and the proposal was dropped as part of a cost- cutting exercise to reduce the overall cost of the fort-building programme.Clements, p. 135 Instead, a new Grain Fort was built on land, while the existing battery at Garrison Point was rebuilt as the two-tier casemated Garrison Point Fort. Close-up view of the Second World War fire director tower built on top of Grain Tower The tower's smoothbore guns were soon replaced with RMLs: one 56-pdr. and two 32-pdrs. These were withdrawn as late as 1910, when the tower was repurposed as a communications tower. In 1915, two 4.7-inch quick-firing (QF) guns were moved from Grain Wing Battery and installed on Grain Tower to counter the new threat of fast torpedo boats. This required the construction of a raised concrete and stone structure on the tower's roof within which the new guns were emplaced, and a shelter was created to provide room for detachments, stores and fire control. The body of the tower was also altered to upgrade the ammunition storage. The guns remained in place through the First World War, when the Grain Tower found an additional purpose as one end of a boom defence stretching across the Medway to Sheerness. The massive iron chain from the boom is still present, wrapped around the base of the tower. A fixed timber section of the boom stood between the tower and the shoreline. The tower was disarmed in 1929. During the Second World War much bigger changes were made when the tower became the location, in 1939, for a twin 6-pdr. QF gun. A large roofed concrete emplacement was constructed on the roof to house the gun with a tall directing tower at its rear. A Defence Electric Light Emplacement was also added to the fabric of Grain Tower. At the tower's rear, a brick and concrete barrack block standing on stilts was constructed to house the gun detachment. It is a freestanding structure but is connected to the tower via catwalks. In 1944 the tower was reduced to care and maintenance status before being decommissioned in 1956. Current status Grain Tower remains intact, though it is listed as \\"at risk\\" due to its poor condition and ongoing decay. English Heritage designated the tower as a Grade II listed building in 1986, forming part of a broader scheduled monument designated in 1976 to cover \\"coastal artillery defences on the Isle of Grain, immediately east and south east of Grain village\\". There is no public access, though it is reported to be used informally by anglers and has been visited by urban explorers. The Grain Tower Battery in July 2018 In 2005 a private owner purchased it from the Crown Estate and put it up for sale again from 2010, with a guide price of ¬£500,000. The owner, a south-east London builder named Simon Cowper, said that \\"it just didn't work out well as a home ‚Äì plus the cost of doing it [up].\\" It was reportedly sold in 2014 for ¬£400,000, though the new owner wished to remain \\"under the radar\\" until they had secured planning permission for renovations.

He also wrote critical and philosophical essays and reviews. His 1829 novel The Five Nights of St. Albans: A Romance of the Sixteenth Century received a good review from John Gibson Lockhart, an achievement which was considered a rare distinction. Mudford also published short fictional stories which were featured in periodicals such as Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Fraser's Magazine, and Bentley's Miscellany.Online Biography of William Mudford from the Dictionary of Literary Biography hosted by BookRags His short story \\"The Iron Shroud\\", about an iron torture chamber which shrinks through mechanical action and eventually crushes the victim inside,\\"The Iron Shroud\\" at Google Books was first published in August 1830 by Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, and later republished separately in 1839 and 1840 with the subtitle \\"Italian Revenge\\".

He was influenced by John Milton, Joseph Addison, Samuel Johnson, William Cowper, William Collins, Mark Akenside, Thomas Gray, and Oliver Goldsmith. Life and work Mudford was born in Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, London, on 8 January 1782. He exhibited an interest in political philosophy and attended lectures at the university of Edinburgh where he befriended John Black who, at the time, was also a student at the university. Later, Mudford published a series of letters exchanged with Black in William Cobbett's Political Register. The letters centred around a debate about classical education. In the exchanges, Mudford had argued against the merits of classical education, while Black supported the opposite side. In 1810 Mudford published a series of essays under the title The Contemplatist, which were originally published in instalments in a weekly periodical under the same title. The Contemplatist: a series of essays upon morals and literature Author William Mudford Publisher Sherwood, 1810 Original from the University of California Digitized 19 May 2009 336 pages from Google Books He later joined the Morning Chronicle as a parliamentary reporter. Departing from the Chronicle he was employed first as assistant editor, and then as the editor of the Courier which at the time was an influential evening journal on par with the Times. After he came to a disagreement with the owners of the Courier over policy matters, Mudform resigned from the journal and issued a letter justifying his actions. His letter drew a lot of attention at the time. In the aftermath of his departure the Courier lost readership and eventually closed while attempts at inviting Mudford back at the journal proved unsuccessful. Mudford has been described by Sir Walter Scott as an author who \\"loves to play at cherry-pit with Satan.\\"; a Shakespearean expression used to indicate familiarity with the Devil.THE TALE OF TERROR Study of the Gothic Romance BY EDITH BIRKHEAD M.A. ASSISTANT LECTURER IN ENGLISH LITERATURE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL FORMERLY NOB ftE FELLOW IN THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL LONDON CONSTABLE 6f COMPANY LTD.1921 GLASGOW: PRINTED AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS BY ROBERT MACLEHOSB AND CO.

Definition of \\"Playing at Cherry-Pit with Satan\\": Referring to the game of throwing cherry-pits in a hole and also found as an expression in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and used to indicate that Malvolio is on familiar terms with the Devil. p. 37 John H. Collins, analysing the influence of Mudford's work, comments that \\"the Shroud story is a first rate piece of writing comparable to the best half-dozen works by Poe\\" and that \\"it should not just be dismissed as a mere potboiler which the genius of Poe transformed.\\"American Notes & Queries ‚Äì a Journal for the Curious 1943‚Äì44 By Hesperides He goes on to mention that he thinks many readers mistakenly think that the \\"Iron Shroud\\" is one of Poe's works thus further strengthening Poe's reputation by attributing to him a story that he actually plagiarised. In the Dictionary of Literary Biography Mudford's writing is described as vigorous while as a writer he is called a master at creating atmosphere. In the same source, his stories are analysed as lacking the subtlety and psychological depth found in the writings of Edgar Allan Poe but they are described as amusing and entertaining. In 1803 Mudford published his first novel, Augustus and Mary also known as The Maid of Buttermere: A Domestic Tale. Following that, Mudford made a living occupied by more mundane work such as translating foreign works and editing essays and other literary works. He also wrote his second novel Nubilia in Search of a Husband which was his response to the popular Coelebs in Search of a Wife by Hannah More and was clearly aimed at capitalising on the market success of the novel by More. As a young man Mudford showed his ambition by contacting influential and powerful men. When only seventeen, Mudford approached the producer of the Covent Garden Theatre John Philip Kemble, with the suggestion of issuing a pamphlet in his honour. Years later this was followed by a proposal for a theatrical play which was rejected by Kemble. The play itself was subsequently lost. Mudford, at 18, followed the Duke of Kent to Gibraltar as his assistant secretary. Mudford was a Tory and a supporter of the foreign minister of the era George Canning. Mudford was also a close friend and supporter of Samuel Taylor. Mudford was a frequent contributor to Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine At the age of forty he lost a lot of money in speculative ventures in the stock market and had to start again financially. He worked very hard and accepted an offer from the conservative party in East Kent to become the editor of the Kentish Observer. He finally settled in Canterbury and eventually became the owner of the Kentish Observer. He contributed regularly to Blackwood's Magazine and sometimes he wrote a story, a review, and a political paper in the same issue. His series of First and Last stories were very popular as were his contributions under the nickname of The Silent Member. In 1841 Mudford moved back to London where he succeeded Theodore Hook as editor of the John Bull magazine all the while maintaining his connection with the Kentish Observer. During this period his health started declining but he still kept a busy work schedule. In 1848 he wrote his last article on the topic of the French revolution which appeared in the John Bull on 5 March of the same year. Mudford while employed at the Morning Chronicle met William Hazlitt who was also working as a journalist there. A rivalry developed between the two and Hazlitt became one of Mudford's detractors. In Hazlitt's essay in Table-Talk published in 1821 under the title Coffee-House Politicians, Roger Kirkpatrick, one of Hazlitt's friends, is described as a Mudford impersonator. In the essay Mudford was described by Hazlitt as a Contemplative Man who wrote an answer to Coelebs. Hazlitt then goes on to describe him as a man made of fleecy hosiery and fat, pert, and dull as it was possible to be. Hazlitt thought that Mudford was a political hack-type journalist and a government tool and he often criticised and ridiculed him. Charles Dickens used a parody of Mudford's name when he wrote the Mudfog Sketches, creating the town of Mudfog as a parody of Chatham. Mudford was also a founder member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and was among those who voted to create the organisation on 16 June 1824 at Old Slaughter's Coffee House, London.Kathryn Shevelow, For the Love of Animals: The Rise of the Animal Protection Movement (New York: Henry Holt, 2008), p 269. Also see Arthur W. Moss, Valiant Crusade: The History of the RSPCA (London: Cassell, 1961), p 23. Mudford died at 5 Harrington Square, Hampstead Road, on 10 March 1848, leaving a widow and eight children. His second son, William Heseltine Mudford, became the editor of the Standard in 1894. In Mudford's obituary, appearing in the June 1848 issue of Gentleman's Magazine, his abilities as the editor of the Courier were praised. The entry on Mudford for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography appeared in 2004, written by David Finkelstein .

Created in 1986 by the recorder player Jean-Marc Andrieu, the orchestra Les Passions is in residence in the south- west French town of Montauban. This flexible ensemble specialises in the practice of period instruments. Its artistic approach reconciles two principles: a respect for the musical technique of the period (authentic performance) and a dynamic interpretation of the musical composition. Its vocation is to convince the public that ancient music is as relevant to the present as are the writings of Moli√®re, the paintings of La Tour or the architecture of Mansart. Its repertoire extends from the beginning of the 17th century (Monteverdi‚Äôs V√™pres √† la Vierge) to the end of the 18th century (Mozart‚Äôs Requiem) encompassing a large number of the masters of the Baroque era (Bach, Handel, Telemann, Scarlatti, Vivaldi, Purcell, Charpentier‚Ä¶). The orchestra is also dedicated to rediscovering the legacy of French music by producing the opera Stratonice by M√©hul, Daphnis et Alcimadure by Mondonville, and works by Toulouse composers Dupuy, Levens, and Jean Gilles. The orchestra also contributes to the restitution of the musical library of the Dukes of Aiguillon. Formally The Baroque Orchestra of Montauban, at the end of 2003 Jean-Marc Andrieu renamed the orchestra \\"Les Passions\\" in reference to a musical form and to the philosophical and literary subject very much discussed in the 17th and 18th centuries that influenced lyrical composers during the Baroque and Classical periods.  Residence and support  Les Passions currently resides at the Conservatory of Music of Montauban, France. The orchestra receives support from the city of Montauban, the Midi-Pyrenees Region, and the city of Toulouse. It is also registered with the Ministry of Culture and Communication. The orchestra is recorded and distributed by Ligia Digital and Harmonia Mundi.  Discography  *Cantem Nadal - No√´l Baroque Occitan, 2009 *Requiem. Jean Gilles, 2008 *V√™pres V√©nitiennes.

In 1936, he married Charlotte Baranowski, the daughter of Hermann Baranowski, a concentration camp commandant. Hoppe was assigned to the Concentration Camps Inspectorate (Inspektion der Konzentrationslager) under SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Theodor Eicke. He was instrumental in helping Eicke form the Totenkopf Division of the SS in the fall of 1939 and served as Eicke's adjutant. In April 1941, he was given command of an infantry company. In the spring of 1942, he received a severe leg wound in fighting the Red Army near Lake Ilmen in the Demyansk Pocket in Novgorod Oblast, U.S.S.R.Ailsby, Christoper (1997).

SS: Roll of Infamy. p. 76 A promotion to SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer and Commandant of Stutthof were approved and he arrived at Stutthof in September 1942 to take up his new position. As the Soviets advanced westward it was decided by Albert Forster, Gauleiter of Danzig and the SS Higher and Police Leader Fritz Katzmann of military district XX, headquartered in Danzig to evacuate Stutthof. The formal evacuation order \\"Einsatzbefehl No 3\\" was signed by Hoppe on 25 January 1945 at 0500. The evacuation began an hour later under the command of SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Teodor Meyer. The destination of the ‚Äúdeath march‚Äù was a sub-camp of Stutthof near Lauenburg in Pomerania about 87 miles (140 km) west-southwest of Stutthof. After the mass evacuation, Hoppe became commandant of W√∂bbelin concentration camp, a temporary camp set up to take prisoners evacuated from camps about to be overrun by the Red Army. W√∂bbelin was only in existence from 12 February 1945 to 2 May 1945 when it was liberated by the American army. Hoppe was captured by the British in April 1946 in Holstein. He was sent to Camp 165 in Watten, Scotland in August 1947 until January 1948 when he was sent to an internment camp in Fallingbostel which was in the British zone of occupation in West Germany. While awaiting extradition to Poland Hoppe escaped and made his way to Switzerland where he worked as a landscape gardener under a false identity for 3 years before returning to West Germany. He was arrested by the West German authorities on 17 April 1953 in Witten, West Germany. He was tried and convicted as an accessory to murder in 1955. On 4 June 1957 the district court in Bochum re- sentenced Hoppe to nine years and he was released in 1966.Klee, Ernst (2005). Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945.

The fossils of Eoplectreurys were recovered from the ~164 Ma old Middle Jurassic Daohugou formation tuffs in Inner Mongolia, China. History and classification The type specimens are deposited in the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology with the genus being described from a total of seven adult spiders. Eoplectreurys was first studied and described by Drs Paul Selden and Diying Huang, who published their type description in the journal Naturwissenschaften in 2010. The genus name is a combination of the Greek word eos, which means \\"dawn\\", and Plectreurys the name of the modern genus which the fossils closely resemble. Eoplectreurys is considered the oldest described spider genus of the Haplogynae series, predating the described Haplogynae spiders from Cretaceous ambers in Jordan and Lebanon, and is the oldest member of Plectreuridae. The two other Plectreuridae species described from fossils are both known from specimens preserved in amber with Palaeoplectreurys baltica from Eocene Baltic amber and Plectreurys pittfieldi from early Miocene Dominican amber. The modern distribution of Plectreuridae is restricted to Southwestern North America, Central America, and parts of the Greater Antilles. The current restricted range of the family may be due to either the severe cooling at the Eocene‚ÄìOligocene transition or the Pliocene‚ÄìPleistocene ice age. Description The specimens of Eoplectreurys are preserved as compression fossils in the fine-grained lacustrian rocks and thus have been flattened from their dimensions in life. Due to the lack of exterior genitalia on females, it is very difficult to identify possible Eoplectreurys females from among the number of Haplogynae spiders found in the Daohugou formation. Only one specimen is a possible match, having a carapace that is round as in the Eoplectreurys males, while the other known Haplogynae female specimens possess elongated carapaces. Only one other family of spiders, Segestriidae, is similar to the fossils. However the legs of Segestriidae have more spines than the fossils and the overall carapace shape of Segestriids is elongated, with maxillae that do not meet in front of the labium. On average Eoplectreurys was a small spider with the average body length, not including legs, being . The fossils display fused chelicerae, distinctly short legs, and are ecribellate, that is, without the silk spinning organ called a cribellum. The number of eyes is not distinguishable in the fossils and the stridulating file on the pedipalps are not apparent or not present. Eoplectreurys is most similar in structure to the P. tristis group of Plectreurys. The species lived around a lake in a volcanically active area and was found in fine-grained volcanic ash lacustrine (lake-bed) deposits, the ash helping to preserve the specimens.https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/02/spider-fossil/ Accessed 2010-02-11 References Category:Plectreuridae Category:Jurassic arachnids Category:Jurassic animals of Asia Category:Prehistoric arthropods of Asia Category:Fossil taxa described in 2010 Category:Transitional fossils Category:Monotypic Araneomorphae genera Category:Spiders of China ","title":"Eoplectreurys"},{"id":"26158226","text":"Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems (POLES) is a world simulation model for the energy sector that runs on the Vensim software. It is a techno- economic model with endogenous projection of energy prices, a complete accounting of energy demand and supply of numerous energy vectors and associated technologies, and a carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emissions module.  History  POLES was initially developed in the early 1990s in the Institute of Energy Policy and Economics IEPE (now EDDEN-CNRS) in Grenoble, France. It was conceived on the basis of research issues related to global energy supply and climate change and the long-term impact of energy policies. It was initially developed through a detailed description of sectoral energy demand, electricity capacity planning and fossil fuel exploration and production in the different world regions. Along its development it incorporated theoretical and practical expertise in many fields such as mathematics, economics, engineering, energy analysis, international trade and technical change. The initial development of POLES was financed by the JOULE II and III programmes of the European Commission‚Äôs Third and Fourth Framework Programmes (FP) for Research and Technological Development (1990-1994 and 1994-1998) as well as by the French CNRS. Since then, the model has been developed extensively through several projects, some partly financed by FP5, FP6 and FP7, and in collaboration between the EDDEN-CNRS, the consulting company Enerdata and the European Joint Research Centre IPTS. With a history spanning twenty years, it is one of the few energy models worldwide that benefits from a continuous development process and expertise over such an extended time period.  Structure  The model provides a complete system for the simulation and economic analysis of the world‚Äôs energy sector up to 2050. POLES is a partial equilibrium model with a yearly recursive simulation process with a combination of price-induced behavioural equations and a cost- and performance-based system for a large number of energy or energy-related technologies. Contrary to several other energy sector models, international energy prices are endogenous. The main exogenous variables are the gross domestic product and population for each country or region.Energy Scenarios, Technology Development and Climate Policy Analysis with the POLES Modelling System The model‚Äôs structure corresponds to a system of interconnected modules and articulates three levels of analysis: international energy markets, regional energy balances, and national energy demand (which includes new technologies, electricity production, primary energy production systems and sectoral greenhouse gas emissions). POLES breaks down the world into 66 regions, of which 54 correspond to countries (including the 28 countries of the European Union) and 12 correspond to countries aggregates; for each of these regions, a full energy balance is modelled. The model covers 15 energy demand sectors in each region.  Demand sectors  Each demand sector is described with a high degree of detail, including activity indicators, short- and long-term energy prices and associated elasticities and technological evolution trends (thus including the dynamic cumulative processes associated with technological learning curves). This allows a strong economic consistency in the adjustment of supply and demand by region, as relative price changes at a sectoral level impact all key component of a region‚Äôs sector. Sectoral value added is simulated. Energy demand for each fuel in a sector follows a market share-based competition driven by energy prices and factors related to policy or development assumptions. The model is composed of the following demand sectors: * Residential and Tertiary: two sectors. * Industry: ** Energy uses in industry: four sectors, allowing for a detailed modelling of such energy- intensive industries such as the steel industry, the chemicals industry and the non-metallic minerals industry (cement, glass). ** Non-energy uses in industry: two sectors, for the transformation sectors such as plastics production and chemical feedstock production. * Transport: four sectors (air, rail, road and other). Road transport modelling comprises several vehicle types (passenger cars, merchandise heavy trucks) and allows the study of inter-technology competition with the penetration of alternative vehicles (hybrids, electric or fuel cell vehicles). * International bunkers: two sectors. * Agriculture: one sector.  Oil and gas supply  There are 88 oil and gas production regions with inter-regional trade; these producing regions supply the international energy markets, which in turn feed the demand of the 66 aforementioned world regions. Fossil fuel supply modelisation includes a technological improvement in the oil recovery rate, a linkage between new discoveries and cumulative drilling and a feedback of the reserves/production ratio on the oil price. OPEC and non-OPEC production is differentiated. The model includes non-conventional oil resources such as oil shales and tar sands.  Power Generation  There are 30 electricity generation technologies, among which several technologies that are still marginal or planned, such as thermal production with carbon capture and storage or new nuclear designs. Price-induced diffusion tools such as feed-in tariffs can be included as drivers for projecting the future development of new energy technologies. The model distinguishes four typical daily load curves in a year, with two-hour steps. The load curves are met by a generation mix given by a merit order that is based on marginal costs of operation, maintenance and annualized capital costs. Expected power demand over the year influences investment decisions for new capacity planning in the next step.  Emissions and carbon price  The model includes accounting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and allows visualising GHG flows on sectoral, regional and global levels. POLES covers fuel combustion-related emissions in all demand sectors, thus covering over half of global GHG emissions. The six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are covered (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulphur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons). The model can be used to test the sensibility of the energy sector to the carbon price as applied to the price of fossil fuels on a regional level, as envisaged or experimented by cap and trade systems like the EU‚Äôs Emissions Trading Scheme.  Databases  The model‚Äôs databases have been developed by IPTS, EDDEN and Enerdata. Data on technological costs and performances were provided by the TECHPOL database.Emissions Constraints and Induced Technical Change in the Energy Sector: simulations with the POLES modelTechpol, un observatoire des nouvelles technologies de l'√©nergie, Menanteau, P., in Lettre Techniques de l'Ing√©nieur - Energies, 2 (2006) 5-6 The data for historical energy demand, consumption and prices are compiled and provided by Enerdata.POLES description  Uses  The POLES model can be used to study or test the effect of different energy resources assumptions or energy policies and assess the importance of various driving variables behind energy demand and the penetration rates of certain electricity generation or end-use technologies. POLES does not directly provide the macro-economic impact of mitigation solutions as envisaged by the Stern Review, however it allows a detailed assessment of the costs associated with the development of low- or zero-carbon technologies. Linked with GHG emissions profiles, the model can produce marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) for each region and sector at a desired time; these can be used to quantify the costs related to GHG emissions reduction or as an analysis tool for strategic areas for emissions control policies and emissions trading systems under different market configurations and trading rules.Coupling with the GEM-E3 model Studies including POLES simulations have been commissioned by international bodies such as several Directorates-General of the European Commission,Greenhouse gas reduction pathways in the UNFCCC process up to 2025 - study for DG ENVWorld Energy Technology Outlook 2050 - study for DG RTD national energy, environment, industry and transport agenciesFacteur 4 - study for the French ministry of finance and industry or private actors in the energy sector.Sharing developed countries‚Äô post-2012 greenhouse gas emission reductions based on comparable efforts  Criticism  POLES can model changes in sectoral value added and shifts of activity between sectors. However POLES is not a macroeconomic model in the sense that it uses the gross domestic product as an input and includes no feedback on it that could result from the evolution of the energy system: carbon pricing, falling oil production and its effect on transport and mobility, or growth induced by technological innovation (such as the IT boom of the 1990s). As such, it does not provide the total impact on society of, e.g., climate adaptation or mitigation (it does however quantify the total cost to the energy sector, including investment necessary in the development of low-carbon technologies). The model does not cover all greenhouse gases emissions, notably those related to agriculture (in part), land use, land-use change and forestry. As such, the climate component of the model does not allow to fully project GHG stocks, concentrations and associated temperature rises from anthropogenic climate change.Economic Assessment of Post-2012 Global Climate Policies using POLES and GEM-E3  See also  * Energy economics * Energy modeling * Energy policy * UNFCCC  External links  * Enerdata * LEPII-EPE * JRC IPTS  References  Category:Energy economics Category:Energy models ","title":"Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems"},{"id":"26158230","title":"1949 Ostzonenmeisterschaft"},{"id":"26158237","text":"Kali Banerjee (20 November 1921 ‚Äì 5 July 1993) was an Indian film actor, who worked in the 1950s‚Äì1970s in Bengali cinema.

Career Starring in many commercial ventures in the 1960s, his association with the serious film-makers is what has given the late actor an imperishable place in the history of Bengali cinema. His starred first in the movie named 'Tatinir Bichar' and 'Barmar Pathe' (On the way to Burma). Further he brought out a convincing portrayal of a young Chinese vendor Lu Wang in the street of Kolkata in time of India's freedom struggle in Mrinal Sen's Neel Akasher Neechey (1959).Kali Banerjee - the legend of realistic films 12 November 2008. He acted in Satyajit Ray's Parash Pathar (1958) and Teen Kanya (1961), but it was his association with Ritwik Ghatak, with whom he worked in Nagarik (1952), Ajantrik (1958) that the cinephiles mostly enjoy and want to commemorate. He played a Bahurupi in Bari Theke Paliye. Then there was Ajantrik, where he was flawless in the portrayal of an idiosyncratic driver Bimal who is love with his car. Besides these Arthouse films, he acted with aplomb in the films such as * Kabuliwala (1956), Badsha, Kinu Gowalar Goli, Guru Dakshina and the Hindi films such as Bawarchi (1972) directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee. He acted as the leading character 'Totla Ganesh' (stammering Ganesh) in Satyen Bose's popular hit comedy Barjatri (1951) (English title: The Marriage Procession).

Founded in 1996 by Douglas Young and Benjamin Lau, the brand is known for their tongue-in-cheek interpretation of Hong Kong design and culture. The English name 'G.O.D.' is a homophonic translation of the Cantonese \\"‰ΩèÂ•ΩÂï≤\\" (jyu hou di) , which roughly translates as \\"to live better\\". At the end of 2019, there are eight store locations in Hong Kong. The company also sells products wholesale or brand-license to boutiques or department stores in cities such as London, Amsterdam, New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore. alt= History Architects by training, co-founders Douglas Young and Benjamin Lau wanted to do a lifestyle and home accessories store, with an aim to design and manufacture the products instead of shipping Chinese goods made in the West. They launched G.O.D. with their first store in an Ap Lei Chau warehouse (closed 2014) in 1996. Within two years, other locations followed including on Hollywood Road in Central, Tsim Sha Tsui (closed 2012). The Hollywood Road store is now their flagship and is home to the famous Instagram mural done in collaboration with street artist, Alex Croft in 2012. G.O.D. x Alex Croft Graffiti Wall outside the Hollywood Road store (corner of Graham Street and Hollywood Road) In 2001, G.O.D. opened its 20,000 square foot flagship store at Leighton Centre (closed 2013) in Causeway Bay, as well as lifestyle mall 'Delay No Mall', also in Causeway Bay in 2008. In 2008, the company introduced a 'Hong Kong Street Culture Gallery' at the Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre in Shek Kip Mei, Kowloon, also the location of their design studio and office. The studio remains at this location thought the Gallery is closed. In 2009, G.O.D. opened at The Peak Galleria (closed 2015) and in Stanley Plaza and Sai Kung in 2011. In July 2012, they expanded overseas and opened a 6,000 square foot flagship store (closed 2015) in Singapore's historical riverside Clarke Quay. In 2014, G.O.D. became an anchor tenant in PMQ, the historic heritage building turned creative hub in Soho and in the same year returned to Causeway Bay (closed end of 2019). In 2015, G.O.D. expanded in Asia once again by opening three stores in Taiwan (closed 2017) and two pop-up stores in Hong Kong - one at the Hong Kong International Airport in the Departures Hall and the other in Lab Concept (closed 2020) in Admiralty . In the beginning of 2016, G.O.D. opened a store in the MH Mall in Shenzhen, China (closed 2019). G.O.D. opened their second Hong Kong International Airport store in 2018 along with a store in the Hong Kong station (near Exit E / Tung Chung MTR line, closed 2019). Concept Taking inspiration from both the condensed urban centres and rural environments of Asia, G.O.D. is influenced by the concept of the eastern lifestyle as an alternative to the western way of living. The idea of such a cultural contradiction is especially prevalent in a city like Hong Kong, a city that boasts a modernised way of life combined with traditional Chinese practices. Young wanted to build a brand based on traditional images of Hong Kong and believes that \\"the most successful brands tend to incorporate national identity. Not many Hong Kong brands actually feel very Hong Kong. I want to do something different: to give ourselves some pride and some respect. Some of our signature items have a quirky Hong Kong feel ‚Äì they are unmistakable.\\" Young also said in an interview with Hong Kong Trade Development Council that \\"I'm trying to push Hong Kong traditions, to make the ordinary and mundane into something extraordinary. When I hear people saying 'wow' about my products, it's great because it shows Hong Kong's flexibility.\\" The intention is to provide 'something desirable' that the customers 'have not even imagined before'. Products G.O.D. shop on Hollywood Road Hong Kong, with the \\"Delay No More\\" slogan, in 2008 G.O.D.'s core range of lifestyle products are designed in-house, and their product range consists mostly of fashion, home accessories and premium gifts. The designs and prints are inspired by old and new aspects of Hong Kong culture, including products themed with Chinese \\"Double Happiness\\" characters, newspaper classifieds, retro local product packaging, 1950s advertisements, old letter boxes. Such products includes \\"Bishop\\" and \\"Rook\\" bean bags, inspired by Chinese chess and pencil case in the design of old-school Chinese ballet flats. In 2003, the company introduced its trademark slogan, \\"Delay No More\\". The phrase is a homophonic translation of the Cantonese profanity d√≠u n√©ih l√≥uh m√≥uh (Â±å‰Ω†ËÄÅÊØç) \\"fuck your mother\\", but in English it is a call to action; and it is emblazoned on T-shirts and other products. Crossover projects \\"Bing Sutt Corner\\" at Starbucks on Duddell Street in 2009 ;Starbucks In June 2009, G.O.D. collaborated with Starbucks to create a store with a \\"Bing Sutt Corner\\" at their outlet on Duddell Street in Central. It is a concept that fuses the retro Bing Sutt, a Hong Kong teahouse, style with the contemporary look of a coffeehouse. The coffee company states that, \\"This very unique Starbucks store has been built as a collaborative project with the quintessential Hong Kong brand G.O.D. (Goods of Desire). It is a celebration of Hong Kong's roots and spirit\\". ;Rugby Sevens For the 2012 Hong Kong Sevens, G.O.D. teamed up with sportswear brand Kukri Sports to produce merchandising for the tournament. The products, carried the specially designed \\"Kukri x G.O.D.\\" logo, which featured elements of the original Hong Kong flag, and ranged from polo shirts, traditional Chinese jackets, boxers, Cheongsam-inspired ladies polo, messenger and tote bags. A percentage of sales went to the Foodlink Foundation, supported by both companies. ;Cathay Pacific Starting in October 2012, Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific introduced a new range of amenity kits for Premium economy passagers, designed by G.O.D. The kits were designed as collectible with each bag being able to hook onto each other to form a wall-hanging accessory. The first two available were 'Joy' and 'Fortune', with designs that depict Chinese gods relaxing in-flight and of auspicious clouds respectively. They include 90% recycled plastic bottles and toothbrush made mainly from biodegradable corn starch and cellulose. Since then, G.O.D. has designed two bags every six months for the Cathay Pacific. Maxim's From 2009 to 2014, G.O.D. collaborated with powerhouse Hong Kong bakery, Maxim's, to design mooncakes for the Chinese Mid-autumn festival. They came up with presenting the traditional treats in the shape of bottoms in eight different designs, but still filled with traditional white lotus seed paste and salted yolks. In 2013, G.O.D. debuted the wildly popular Mahjong Box Pineapple Cake Gift Box, which were all snapped up within days of its debut. The Majong Box Pineapple Cake Gift Box was jointly created by Goods of Desire and Mei-Xin Fine Goods in Hong Kong. Exhibition In September 2012, the brand in co-operation with Sino Art, held The Street Market Symphony Exhibition at Olympian City, their first solo art exhibition in a shopping mall. The exhibition used multi-media installations housed in large red lampshades, the iconic representation of Hong Kong's wet markets. From 2010 to 2014, Young and G.O.D. designed the Club Lounge at Art HK followed by its successor, Art Basel Hong Kong, highlighting the icons of Hong Kong culture. The first year featured the Copper Towers Controversy In 2007, Young and seventeen employees were taken in by police for selling T-shirts bearing the logo '14K', the name of one of the city's triad crime syndicates. \\"Police claimed the shop had broken a section of an 1845 anti-triad law called the Societies Ordinance, which allows for the arrest of any person in possession of 'any books, accounts, writing, lists of members, seals, banners or insignia of or relating to any triad society.' Triad members still often carry such insignia ‚Äì usually worn on the backs of shirts ‚Äì that they show to shopkeepers in exchange for protection money.\\" Authorities \\"confiscated 88 shirts and more than 500 postcards printed with a \\"14K\\" logo ‚Äì with the numbers written in Chinese characters ‚Äì from the store's five offices and warehouse located in Central, Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui and Yuen Long.\\" Young states that \\"[It] was all a misunderstanding and the shirts were actually referring to 14 karat gold\\". The 18 employees, including Young, were released the next day, and \\"their 14K T-shirts, are now collector's items,\\" according to CNN Travel.

Background Aed is one of a number of 11th-century kings of U√≠ Maine who is obscure. According to John O'Donovan, this seems to have been as a result both of historical confusion, and possibly genealogical re-ramification, where the pedigree of one branch of the U√≠ Maine was later treated as a king-list. His place in the genealogical tree is uncertain, which reflects the tumult in the kingdom, following the long reigns of Tadhg M√≥r Ua Cellaigh (986-1014) and his son, Concobar mac Tadg Ua Cellaig (1014-1030). He is called Aed mac maic Taidhg h-√öi Cellaig but it is unclear which Taidhg is meant. The state of U√≠ Maine By the 1130s, the kingdom was a vassal state of Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. One of the few, albeit indirect, references to the kingdom during Aed's reign was the battle of Caill Cobhtaigh in 1131: > The battle of Caill-Cobhthaigh was gained over the Sil-Muireadhaigh by the > people of Upper Connaught, the former having come on a predatory excursion > into Munster; and both parties having engaged through mistake, the Sil- > Muireadhaigh left their spoils behind. Upper Connacht in this sense means south Connacht, which comprised almost the entire of U√≠ Maine. Warfare in 1132 In 1132, M√°enmaige, the westernmost section of the kingdom, was \\"plundered by Conchobhar ua Briain, who carried off many cows.\\" He may have attended the conference of Abhall Chethernaigh in his capacity as a vassal, where \\"Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair and Conchobhar Ua Briain, with the chiefs of the clergy of Connaught and Munster ... [made] a year's peace was made between them.\\" Aed died the same year died Muireadhach ua Flaithbheartach, King of Maigh Se√≥la. It is unknown if there were any connection between the two deaths - Muireadhach's kingdom bordered Maenmaige -, if as a result of ua Briain's attack, a succession dispute, or by other means.

All the nearby land including the coast of New Guinea was called by the Spaniards Magna Margarita to honour the wife of the king of Spain at that time Philip III, Margaret of Austria. Still today the nearby coastal village of Magarida keeps this name.Hilder, Brett The voyage of Torres, Brisbane, 1980, pp.42,48,51,54 This island was visited by Polish anthropologist Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski in 1914. Mailu Island was also visited by Austrian anthropologist and photographer Hugo Bernatzik in 1932. Bernatzik, who published an ethnography a few years later, described Mailu as a very pleasant place and had a good impression of the Mailuans, as reliable people of a good character and skilled seafarers. He admired the buildings and the boats and took photographs of Mailu houses from the inside and outside. Bernatzik also took pictures of the islanders and their artifacts, reflecting a culture that he deemed was dying in contact with the modern world.Hugo Bernatzik, S√ºdsee; ein Reisebuch. first edition Leipzig 1934 Frank Hurley also visited Mailu during his journeys.Photograph album of Papua and the Torres Strait Between 1972 and 1974 New Zealand archaeologist Geoffrey IrwinGeoffrey Irwin, The Emergence of Mailu as a Central Place in Papuan Prehistory. 1985 carried out a survey of Mailu Island and the neighbouring coast where linguistically related groups, speakers of Mailuan languages, live.

Takasu was commissioned as a lieutenant in December 1913, serving on the battleship , followed by the cruiser . He attended the 17th class of the Naval Staff College and was promoted to lieutenant commander upon graduation in December 1919. On June 23, he was assigned as a military attach√© to the United Kingdom and was promoted to commander in December of the same year. After his return to Japan in 1924, he served as executive officer on the cruiser . A year later, he was assigned as an instructor at the Naval War College and promoted to captain in December 1928, after which he received his first command, the cruiser in 1929. Takasu returned to England again in December 1930 to serve as military advisor on the ambassador‚Äôs staff. He served on the court marshal of the perpetrators of the May 15 Incident in 1932. He was promoted to rear admiral on November 15, 1934 and reassigned to head the 3rd Bureau of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, which was in charge of military intelligence. An outspoken opponent to the Tripartite Alliance between Japan, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, he was a member of the naval faction led by Isoroku Yamamoto and Mitsumasa Yonai opposed to war with the western powers. From 1936-1937, he commanded the First Carrier Division, which was active in combat in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was a naval advisor to the fledgling state of Manchukuo in 1937. Promoted to vice admiral on November 15, 1938, he then became commandant of the Naval War College. He was assigned as commander of the IJN 5th Fleet on September 29, 1939. On April 29, 1940, Takasu was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 1st class. On November 15, 1940, Takasu was assigned to command the IJN 4th Fleet, and from August 11, 1941, the IJN 1st Fleet. As the military position of Japan became precarious in the Solomon Islands and other areas of the Southwest Pacific, Takasu was assigned to command the Southwest Area Fleet from September 15, 1942. The IJN 13th Air Fleet also came under his command from September 20, 1943. Promoted to full admiral on March 1, 1944, he was recalled to Japan on June 18, to assume the position of military councilor. However, he died of sickness only two months later and his grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo. Notes References * Evans, David C. and Mark R. Peattie. (1997).

He is well known for his character roles and for his own style of acting in Bengali films from the late 1940s until the mid-1980s. Early life and education He was born in Kolkata, but his ancestral home was Madanpur, Nadia, West Bengal, India. Madanpur in the Nadia district. As a scion of a rich and aristocratic family, he grew up in liberal surroundings. He first attended Mitra Institution for his matriculation. Then Roy graduated with a Bachelor's of Arts from the University of Calcutta (Presidency College), and later earned a B.L (now it is called LL.B) from the same university. Career Acting in films He acted in numerous films, including Ratnadeep, 42, Uttar Falguni, Surya Toran, Neel Akasher Neechey, Marutirtha Hinglaj, Jiban Kahini, Jiban Trishna, and Chhadmabeshi. In the early 1950s, he acted as Kamal, the protagonist in the romantic comedy Chheley Kaar and also as a funny grandfather in the 1980 comedy Ogo Bodhu Shundori, followed by similar roles during the end of his career. But what may be his most famous role was the character of the selfless barrister Manish, whose committed to his beloved, a courtesan (played by Suchitra Sen), in Uttar Falguni. He also did a number of radio plays for Akashvani and shot into fame after being cast in the role of a ruthless, tyrannic military officer in the film 42 that included stars like Abhi Bhattacharya, Manju Dey, and Sombhu Mitra among others as stalwarts. His acting prowess and versatility could be gauged in films like Ratnadeep, where he plays the role of an imposter who reforms himself, as the prodigal hero in Naa, as the strife-torn co- protagonist in Surjamukhi (which he also produced), as the affluent businessman who rose from the rags in Surya Toran, as a protagonist (opposite Uttam Kumar) who aspires to beat his rival but is torn within himself in Jiban Trishna, as a patriot in Masterda Surya Sen, as the patriarch in Kanch Kata Hirey, as a caring brother in Dhuli, as the quiet and intense husband in Smriti Tuku Thak (opposite Suchitra Sen who plays a double role), as the quarrelsome husband in Jatugriha (directed by Tapan Sinha and starring Uttam Kumar, Arundhati Devi, and Binota Roy), in Baghini as a police officer, in negative roles - Bibhas, Agni Sanskar, Jighansa, Adwitiya, Bhola Moira, and Karcher Swarga, as a compassionate and humorous doctor in Arohi, as a psychological patient in Andhar Periye (both directed by Tapan Sinha), as a quack in Ramer Sumati, as the elder brother and head of the family in Bindur Chheley, as the hapless and helpless father in Maya Mriga in the early 1960s, and as the proud and high-handed father in Devdas (starring Soumitra Chatterjee, Sumitra Mukherjee, Uttam Kumar, and Supriya Devi) in the late 1970s and so on. One of the most prominent and best roles played by him was in Arogya Niketan, playing the cameo role of Moshay, an old village doctor who believes firmly in the Vedic way of medical practice, however, not being absolutely illogical and apartheid to modern medicine and the treatments associated with it. For this role, he happened to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali as well. Acting in theatrical plays His foray in commercial plays was commendable; most worth mentioning being Nahabat which ran for more than 1,200 nights. He pioneered the holding of stage-plays where the characters read out the play and their respective roles in front of the audience; known as \\"Shruti Natok\\" (audio drama). The most famous in this genre being Shesher Kobita and Chirakumar Sabha, based respectively on a novel and a play by Rabindranath Tagore. He also acted in a number of radio-plays on Akashvani/All India Radio (AIR), most notably Suk Sari (with Tripti Mitra) and Dui Bon. Directing films His love for the silver screen drove him to produce and direct a number of films like Marutirtha Hinglaj, Raja Saja (both featuring Uttam Kumar as the leading actor), Basant Bahar, Carey Saheber Munshi ‚Äì a film based on the life and times of Ramram Basu (1757-1813), and Debotar Graash, based on a poem by Rabindranath Tagore. Autobiography He remained active well into the 1980s, gradually moving to cameo roles, owing to his failing health. He has few autobiographical titles to his credit - Mone Pore, Kichhu Chhabi, Kichhu Galpo, Prasanga Abhinoy, and Aami.

Capricorn was first used in the HP-85 desktop BASIC computer, introduced in January 1980. Steve Wozniak was inspired to build the Apple to be a computer like the HP 9830, and in 1976 he offered HP rights to the Apple computer. He was turned down and was given a release. When the calculator division started an 8 bit computer project called Capricorn, he left for Apple when he wasn't allowed to work on that project.Byte Interview with Steve WozniakOld Computers HP-85  Architecture  The Capricorn is a microprogrammed CPU containing 64 eight-bit registers, an eight-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a shifter and control logic. The 64 registers are split by boundaries. There is a boundary every two bytes for the first 32 registers and one boundary per 8 bytes for the remaining 32 registers. Each low-level instruction modifies data beginning at the register addressed up to the next boundary. The design results in very compact code. It was up to the coder to access and modify between one and eight bytes using only one CPU instruction. The first 32 registers are often used for address manipulation. The remaining 32 registers are used for floating point operations. Because there are four sets of eight byte boundary registers (32-63) most floating point operations are done using only registers without any memory access. Behalf of the first 32 registers one register pair is defined as the program counter, another pair as the stack pointer, and one more pair as an index pointer for internal operations. There is no dedicated accumulator ‚Äî any general register can be used for ALU results because the register file is designed to allow up to two read and one write operations for the first 32 registers and up to eight read and one write operations for the remaining 32 registers at the same time. Any pair of registers can be used as a 16-bit index register. The ALU can work either in binary or binary-coded decimal (BCD) mode. Variable-length instructions let the programmer treat data in the upper 32 registers as entities between one and eight bytes in length ‚Äî for example, two eight-byte values (e.g. mantissa of a floating-point number) can be added using a single instruction. This feature reduces the number of loops that need to be programmed. The CPU has an interrupt mechanism with up to 127 vectors. For direct memory access, the CPU can be halted by an external device.  Implementation  The Capricorn CPU was implemented as a silicon- gate NMOS logic circuit (4.93√ó4.01 mm) in a 28-pin dual in-line package, with an 8-bit, multiplexed external bus. The CPU chip consumed 330 mW at 625 kHz. CPU timing is controlled by four non-overlapping clock phases with 200 nanosecond width and 200 nanosecond spacing, for an overall clock cycle of 1.6 microseconds, equivalent to 625 kHz clock frequency. The complete system included support chips co-designed with the CPU, such as a dynamic memory controller, keyboard controller with timers, printer controller and CRT controller. A special buffer chip connected to the expansion slots.

Foundation, established in 1953, is recognized by decree of the President of the Italian Republic and has conventions with Bologna University and other institutions: it operates in conditions of absolute autonomy regarding both in relation to churches and universities. It is open to public and private funding, as we all as that of foundations, companies, cooperatives and to ties with other centers. It intends to give continuity to the scientific research in the area of historical cultural activities begun by the intuition of Giuseppe Dossetti (1913‚Äì1996) and which developed thanks to the intellectual passion of Giuseppe Alberigo (1926‚Äì2007) who, for nearly 50 years, was its soul and secretary. From this consideration derives a non-antiquarian taste for research and the conviction that rigorous knowledge of the historical processes is an adequate and exhaustive way to participate in the collective intellectual and spiritual dynamism by which research is continuously increased. History In 1953 Giuseppe Dossetti, after having left political life (in which he had entered by participating in the Resistance and where he covered important roles both as vice secretary of the DC and as founder of the association Vita Humana and as the soul of the journal Cronache Sociali) gave life to a common experience of intellectual and spiritual research; the initiative with a group of men and women all younger than he was, then forty years old, settled in Bologna because of the presence of Giacomo Lercaro. At via San Vitale 114 he placed his books and started to construct a specialized library that could be an adequate instrument for the group. In a short time the library gained a size and quality rare in Italy, especially then: an international horizon of readings, a rigorous vision of research, the belief that through a free and strict condition of historical, theological patristic exegetical philosophical study one could strengthen a season of renewal of Christianity. In 1956 the two dimensions ‚Äì that more intellectual and that which was more clearly monastic were separated ‚Äì and the centre of documentation (a voluntarily neutral term) continued its activities in a different relation with Dossetti, which became again quite intense after the announcement of the opening of Vatican II. Dossetti participated in the council as an expert of Lercaro and that which had become the name of the Institute of Religious Sciences worked as a sort of workshop offering the decisive materials for the debates (Pope Paul VI expressed his gratitude to Alberigo for the volume on the doctrine of the powers of the universal church and the head of the Sant‚Äô Uffizio mons. Parente quoted him in the discussion), but also weaving vast relations (the historians and theologians Marie Dominique Chenu or Yves Congar, the biblical scholar Jacques Du Pont, the patrologist Jean Gribomont, the philosopher Ivan Illich, the ecumenist Emmanuele Lanne, the medievalist Jean Leclerq, the theologian of religions Raimon Pannikar, the dogmatic theologian Joseph Ratzinger for example beside those already consolidated with the historians and receiving unequaled intellectual stimuli. The dramatic conclusion of the episcopate of Lercaro in Bologna and the departure of Dossetti for the Middle East did not terminate the experience of San Vitale: on the contrary, once the idea of becoming a part of the university was set aside, the research group of which Pino Alberigo was the soul and motor became bigger, becoming at the beginning of the 1970s a reference point for the formation of a generation of scholars in the most different disciplines of the historical and religious branches and the great masters of that epoch (Roger Aubert, Henri Chadwick, Eugenio Corecco, De Halleux, Georg Kretschmar, Alois Grillmeier, Rudolf Schnackenburg, Brian Tierney, Jean-Marie Tillard, Robert Trisco and others). Once it had passed from the form of institute to that of an association recognized by law, of which the first signature was that of Benigno Zaccagnini and voted by the entire parliament, the reality of San Vitale 114 met with its last institutional metamorphosis in 1985, recommended by Nino Andreatta. For him the juridical form of the foundation was necessary in order to recognize that what had been established went beyond the life limits of the founders and protagonists. The association for the development of religious sciences of which Enzo Bianchi was president gave life to the foundation of Religious sciences John XXIII. Recognized by law, it was presided by Adreatta from 1985 to 2007. By the beginning of the 1980s and with a new recruitment of scholars the Institute returned to concentrate itself on grand collective projects ‚Äì first that mainly Italian on Pope Roncalli, from whose works started the request of collaborating on the historical question of the beatification of John XXIII of September 2000, then the mainly international group from which five volumes emerged of the History of the Second Vatican Council, translated into seven languages and the important monographs and acts of congresses emerged from the production of this work. In all these years the growth of the library ‚Äì which has a shelving system designed by Dossetti himself at the beginning of the activities of the institute ‚Äì has progressed without stopping making Via San Vitale a reference point for the scholars and a laboratory of formation which, without ties with any religious authority which is none other than that of loyalty and contacts with the academic work which are none other than that of scientific research, which belongs to the great European heritage. Location It was Angelo Saizzoni who in 1953 suggested some buildings in Via San Vitale 114 to Dossetti as a center of documentation. Since then ‚Äì along with the juridical changes ‚Äì these have remained the center of the present Foundation. The ancient hospital of Saint Gregory of the Incurables outside the medieval walls of the city, then hospital of the Poveri Vergognosi connected to Santa Maria della Piet√† within the walls of modern Bologna, the complex of San Vitale was for many decades a religious foundation which used it as an asylum, and then for private renting which have for a long time coexisted with the library and the research group of the institute. In the first anniversary of the death of Dossetti an agreement between the university represented by its Rector Fabio Alberto Roversi Monaco, the region presided by Antonio La Forgia, the mayor of Bologna represented by the vice mayor Luigi Pedrazzi and the Foundation represented by Andreatta was announced in the presence of the then-Prime Minister Romano Prodi. The entire building was acquired by the university and leased for free for fifty years to the foundation. A regional law and then the prime minister and then the university financed the complex restoration completed in 2003. Thanks to a donation of 2007 by which the mayor Sergio Cofferati, has honored the agreement taken by the city council of Bologna and the financial support of the prime minister the works have begun for the residence complex which will be at via San Vitale 116 and which will be named after Nino Andreatta. Currently at Via San Vitale 114 there is a library of 2100 square meters with 5323 m of shelves, the journals occupy 900 square meters with 2759metres of compact shelves. The areas for seminars and offices occupy 320 square meters and 330 square meters will be devoted to the residence unit. In Milan at piazza Duomo 2, one may find the Committee for the edition of the Diaries of Roncalli. Collaboration The foundation participates and promotes forms of cooperation in the world of scientific research both by inviting other scholars and centers within its projects both by offering invitations and collaborating with the formation of scholars. Some of the principle experiences of research of the institute ‚Äì the history of the second Vatican Council, the re-edition of the council decisions, the edition of the diaries of Roncalli, the dictionary of the historical ‚Äì religious knowledge of the 20th century ‚Äì have been made possible by the ties which common work has consolidated and which have become also the channels of formation for the new generation of scholars. Today the major scientific collaborations are those begun with: Bei Da, Beijing University for the exchanges and researches on the theme of Imago Dei; Chair Ben Ali, Tunis, for the research on Pacem in Terris; Ecole Francaise de Rome, Academy of Sciences of Moscow, Brown University, Pernambuco University, Excellenzcluster M√ºnster, for the research on Pius XI to which collaborate Lucia Pozzi and Alberto Guasco; Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, Irvine, California, for the research on the councils.

The album contains new versions of eight classic Newbury songs, with a full version of \\"All My Trials\\" which is part of Newbury's \\"An American Trilogy\\" (which is also included on the album.)  Background  In 1988, Airborne Records planned a release in which Newbury demos were treated with synthesizers and other then-contemporary production effects. These demos stemmed from sessions with producer Larry Butler in Nashville in March 1983 and featured new age synthesizer sounds, which Newbury came to loath. \\"I was so drunk then,\\" he later explained. \\"I hate those cuts and never want to hear 'em again.\\" Newbury also claimed to have thrown a cassette of the recording on the ground and stomped on it. Newbury was aghast when he heard that Airborne was planning to release the recordings, and had even printed up the album art, but, after learning that no CDs or cassettes had yet been made, Newbury instead re- recorded the songs Airborne planned to use, and the album was released with these new recordings, effectively Newbury's first recordings in years. Newbury recorded the album with accompaniment from violinist Marie Rhines. The set includes Newbury classics \\"An American Trilogy\\", \\"San Francisco Mabel Joy\\", \\"Lovers\\", and \\"Cortelia Clark\\". \\"Poison Red Berries\\" was originally released as \\"I Don't Think About Her No More\\" on Looks Like Rain while \\"Willow Tree\\" was originally titled \\"Wish I Was\\" and released on His Eye Is on the Sparrow. Rhines later recalled: > When I arrived at the studio at 11AM, I remember it was quiet, no one > around, except Mickey ‚Äì who had set up two chairs in this big empty > studio...I sat down, and then we began to play and never stopped until side > one was done...We returned after a brief lunch, sat down and went through > the exact order of side two never stopping the tape until we had finished > the final song. Done. Mickey loved the results. After recording had finished, Newbury convinced Larry Butler and Airborne to release his new version of the album instead, which they eventually agreed to do. Airborne did release the recordings Mickey rejected, also titled In a New Age, but had a Canadian distribution through CBS Music Products-catalogue No. ABK-61000. The title on the actual compact disc is printed A Legend In A New Age ‚Äì one that Newbury initially rejected. In 1999, In a New Age was revised by Newbury's label Mountain Retreat, bass, percussion, guitar, and sound effects were added. It was paired with a 1988 concert with accompaniment by violinist Rhines as part of a 2-CD set It Might As Well Be the Moon.

(Review of J. E. M. Latham's book at findarticles.com) Supporters of Alcott House, or the Concordium, were a key group involved in the formation of the Vegetarian Society in 1847. History and ideology The prime mover behind the community was \\"sacred socialist\\" and mystic James Pierrepont Greaves, who was influenced by American Transcendentalist Amos Bronson Alcott, and Swiss educational reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Together with his followers, who included Charles Lane ‚Äì and with the help of wealthy sponsors, Sophia and Georgiana Chichester ‚Äì he founded Alcott House on Ham Common in Surrey in 1838. The Ham Common Concordium, as it came to be known, consisted of a working mixed cooperative community and a progressive school for children. The community was dedicated to a regime of spiritual development and purification ‚Äì in the words of Greaves, aiming to produce the \\"most loveful, intelligent and efficient conditions for divine progress in humanity\\". To this end the members submitted to an austere regime of early rising, strict vegetarianism (usually raw food), no stimulants, celibacy, and simple living, and experimented with various practices such as astrology, hydrotherapy, mesmerism and phrenology. The men grew their hair and beards long and wore loose fitting clothes, while the women defied convention by not wearing the traditional, restrictive corset. Alcott House school was open to children from both inside and outside the community ‚Äì the latter usually from radical parents who sympathised with its progressive educational stance. The curriculum emphasised moral education and the development of the child's innate spiritual gifts, teaching practical skills such as gardening and cookery as well as book learning. Punishment was frowned upon and education aimed to produce \\"integral men and women\\", able to live in a truly cooperative society and not simply playing traditional roles. In 1848, the community came to an end and the house was purchased by John Minter Morgan to provide an orphanage, (number 18) though still run along vegetarian lines. In 1856 the foundation stone was laid of a new building on the site, South Lodge, which exists to this day. The new building has been converted to flats and the grounds have been developed as Bishops Close. See also *Fruitlands References Sources *The New Age, and Concordium Gazette (pub. W.

History The Spasskaya Tower was built in 1491 by the Italian architect Pietro Antonio Solari. Initially, it was named the Frolovskaya Tower after the Church of Frol and Lavr in the Kremlin, which is no longer there. The tower's modern name comes from the icon of 'Spas Nerukotvorny' () translated as 'The Saviour Not Made by Hands', which was placed above the gates on the inside wall in 1658 and removed in 1917. The tower is also named for the wall-painted icon of 'Spas Smolensky' () translated as 'Smolensky Saviour', which was created in the 16th century on the outside wall of tower, plastered over in 1937, but reopened and restored in 2010. The Spasskaya Tower was the first tower of the many Moscow Kremlin Towers to be crowned with the hipped roof in 1624‚Äì1625 by architects Bazhen Ogurtsov and Christopher Galloway (a Scottish architect and clock maker). According to a number of historical accounts, the clock on the Spasskaya Tower appeared between 1491 and 1585. It is usually referred to as the Kremlin chimes (–ö—Ä–µ–º–ª—ë–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ –∫—É—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç—ã) and designates official Moscow Time. The clock face has a diameter of 20 feet. The gate of Spasskaya Tower was used to greet dignitaries, and was also used during formal ceremonies or processions. Reverence and respect for the Tsar The tower gate was once the main entrance into the Kremlin. In tsarist times, anyone passing through the gates had to remove their headgear, crossing themselves and dismount their horses. This practice was revived after the Icon of the Saviour was restored in 2010, but ceremonially. \\"The Russians have always regarded the Spasskaya Tower with great reverence. According to old legends, the tower was possessed with miraculous powers and was reputed to protect the Kremlin from enemy invasion. People passing through the gates would always observe the custom of crossing themselves and doffing their hats to show their respect, and horses passing under the gates of the tower were said to shy. In fact, legend has it that Napoleon himself could not prevent his horse from taking fright as he rode through the gates, having failed to show his respect, and the French Emperor's hat was said to have fallen from his head.\\" The Spasskaya Tower was commissioned to be built by Ivan III, or Ivan the Great, the leader of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and the grandfather of Ivan the Terrible. Inscription on Spasskaya Gate On top of the gates of Spasskaya Tower, there appears the following inscription (it is inscribed in Latin): In Latin: IOANNES VASILII DEI GRATIA MAGNUS DUX VOLODIMERI√Ü, MOSCOVI√Ü, NOVOGARDI√Ü, TFERI√Ü, PLESCOVI√Ü, VETICI√Ü, ONGARI√Ü, PERMI√Ü, BUOLGARI√Ü ET ALIAS TOTIUSQUE RAXIE DOMINUS, ANNO 30 IMPERII SUI HAS TURRES CONDERE FECIT ET STATUIT PETRUS ANTONIUS SOLARIUS MEDIOLANENSIS ANNO NATIVIT ATIS DOMINI 1491 KALENDIS MARTIIS IUSSIT PONERE.O.A.

Soviet Union and modern day uses After the rise of the Soviet Union, in 1936 Joseph Stalin replaced the two-headed eagle on top of the Spasskaya Tower with a red star because he wanted to remove all evidence of the former Tsarist periods, the star is rotating in 360¬∞. The height of the tower with the star is 71 meters. The tradition of dismounting the horse and removing the cap ended during the Soviet era, when the Kremlin became the center of government and politics. Cars approached the gate head on from the Lobnoye Mesto and the road beside the GUM department store. All other traffic was routed through the Borovitsky gate. Various cathedrals were demolished throughout the years to make room for other government buildings. It was not until 1955 during the rule of Nikita Khrushchev that the Kremlin was reopened to foreign visitors; the Kremlin was turned into a museum in 1961 and added to the World Heritage List in 1990. The daughter of Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin is the current director of the Kremlin Museums, Elena Gagarina. There are many cathedrals inside the Kremlin walls, and many of them hold church services, however irregularly because the cathedrals are still operated as museums. The Spasskaya Gate posed an issue following the collapse of communism. In the new capitalist and market-based economy, the passage of vehicles disrupted the flow of pedestrians to GUM and other shopping centers, even though few vehicles actually passed through the gate each day. In 1999, the decision was made to finally close the gate to all traffic. The signal lights and guard platforms still remain. The gate is used occasionally when repairs must be made to the Borovissky Gate. However, in that case, all traffic is routed from Vasilyevsky Spusk. Nowadays, the gate opens to receive the presidential motorcades on inauguration day, for the victory parades, and to receive the New Year's tree. Russia's President Vladimir Putin discussed building two monasteries and a church with the city's mayor, Sergey Sobyanin. Gromov would like to get the approval for demolition on one of the administration buildings. This administration building is not an \\"UNESCO World Heritage Site or an object that has any historical or cultural significance\\". Spasskaya Tower is also the honorific for the International Military Music Festival \\"Spasskaya Tower\\"., which is based within the grounds of Red Square. In August 2010 the icon of Smolensk Saviour was uncovered and restored above the gate (see picture below). This begins the tradition of the parade inspector to remove his headgear and cross himself before the inspection of troops during all Moscow Victory Day Parades. Beginning 2016 there has been an hourly guard mounting ceremony by the Kremlin Regiment within the area of the gate.

It currently serves in the Surveillance and Target Acquisition role and is equipped with weapon platform locating equipment, which include radar and sound ranging systems. History The Rocket Troop Madras Horse Artillery was formed in 1805, at the request of the Madras Government and East India Company and it served in the Pindari and Mahratta Wars 1817‚Äì1819. It was re-designated as C Troop, Madras Horse Artillery in 1825. In 1840, the Troop was sent to China as part of an expeditionary force to fight in the First Opium War. Then in 1841, it provided artillery support for a combined land and sea force assaulted the formidable line of forts guarding the mouth of the Xi River, which cleared the way for an attack on Canton (now known as Guangzhou). For its contribution in the campaign, 'C' Troop was conferred the honorary title 'Dragon', and was given permission to include the Chineses dragon and the years '18401842' as part of its insignia. The Troop then served in the second Burma War between 1853 and 1855, and after much renaming, it became 'P' Battery Royal Horse Artillery in 1889. The Battery subsequently served in the Boer War 1900‚Äì1902 and as a training Battery during the First World War. The battery was part of M/P Battery in 3rd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (3 RHA) at the start of the Second World War and was equipped with the 2-pounder anti-tank guns. It latere became P battery, consisting of A, B and C troops at this time, still serving with 3rd RHA until the battery ceased to be part of the Regiment on 15 March 1941. After having its farewell dinner on 10 March, the higher regiment returned to the UK to be reformed as part of 6th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (6 RHA). Many NCO's and men were absorbed by other Batteries of 3 RHA. The battery then served in 6 RHA, seeing service in Palestine, Libya and the Central Zone until 1951 and become 'P' Field Battery Royal Artillery in 1958.

Like its predecessor, rFactor, it is designed to be modified and is used by professional racing teams for driver training and race car development. Much of its source code is derived from rFactor Pro which is also used by professional racers and most of the Formula One teams and NASCAR manufacturers. rFactor 2 is designed to simulate any type of multi-wheeled vehicle of any era including four-wheeled and six-wheeled vehicles with either two or four steered wheels. It features an advanced physics, suspension, and tire model. In September 2016, the developers announced a partnership with Dutch software company Luminis with the goal of bringing new features to the software.  Background  After the initial success of Sports Car GT (1999), Image Space Incorporated used its self-developed software engine isiMotor1 for a number of racing titles, including the highly praised Formula One simulators F1 2002 and F1 Challenge '99-'02. isiMotor is an umbrella term that covers every component of the software engine, for example the graphics engine gMotor, the physics engine pMotor and so on. After the release of F1 Challenge '99-'02, isiMotor was licensed to another company for the first time, SimBin, who went on to produce popular retail sim racing titles based on Image Space Incorporated's engine, including GTR and GTR 2. Image Space Incorporated then decided to make a racing simulator with an open architecture and provided tools for the modding community to create third party content. This title became rFactor which was the first ISI release using the software engine referred to as isiMotor2. rFactor went on to become the preferred racing simulation platform for nearly a decade, with a plethora of community created content. rFactor 2 is also being used to train the drivers who win the Gran Turismo Academy competition. isiMotor2 was further licensed to companies such as Slightly Mad Studios, Reiza Studios and 2Pez Games. isiMotor2 also laid the foundation for rFactor Pro, a software simulation engine used by real life racing teams and car manufacturers including most of the current Formula One grid and NASCAR manufacturers. Image Space Incorporated took the experience from isiMotor2 and rFactor Pro and began the development of rFactor 2. From this point on, the software engine would be referred to as isiMotor2.5. The editor from the sim racing site VirtualR stated: \\"It took me some time to see it but I do recognise rF2 as the best racing sim out there for the serious players\\".  Physics  rFactor 2 and its precursor have received much praise for its highly advanced and accurate simulation of vehicle dynamics and is the preferred simulator for most real life professional racing teams, car engineers and simulation centers. Race Engineer Andrea Quintarelli stated: \\"It is also no surprise for me that most of these professional simulators (or centers) are using rFactor. As I had the chance to prove myself (and probably to somebody reading here), when you know how to properly build your models, rFactor is producing very accurate results, at a very low cost\\". Petros Mak, founder of the professional modding company Mak Corp, stated: \\"All our race team clients and even our series clients, they don't only use rFactor for track familiarization. They also use it to test setup data before they go to an event, they use it to test potential new part data, by developing new brakes or new engine performances and testing it in the game before they actually commit to building it in real life. rF1 and rF2 provide far higher accuracy for those things than any other simulation on the market. [...] rFactor 2's physics engine is by far the most simulation based physics engine using real life aero and physical data that no other title has come close to\\". The interaction and collaboration between Image Space Incorporated and professional racing teams and their engineers using the ISI developed rFactor Pro platform has benefited the new tire model used in rFactor 2. This has resulted in the ISI TGM Tyre Tool, a tool that is also available to third party modders. rFactor 2 is the first consumer simulation featuring a thermomechanical physically-based tire model, based on first principles, simulating the entire carcass, thread and contact patch, with proper heat transfer, accurate tire wear, flatspots and visual deformation. It is also the first to feature truly dynamic track conditions. Most people new to rFactor 2 including experienced simracers are not used to having to manage their tires like in reality, therefore they tend to overdrive the car with too much steering input (something you can get away with in other driving simulations), resulting in overheating tires and excessive tire wear. rFactor 2 also includes a new constraint system that allows for advanced physics simulation such as chassis flex, which removes the typical infinite rigidity of a virtual vehicle and incorporates unique chassis characteristics into the handling and performance of the car as well as highly accurate suspension geometry and wheel rates.  Development  The public first became aware that the development of rFactor 2 was underway when Gjon Camaj of Image Space Incorporated posted WIP in-game screenshots on Twitter in early March 2009. Later that month, he revealed more details about the upcoming simulator alongside additional in-game screenshots. In October 2010, Camaj revealed in an extensive interview plans for including licensed content, a new reworked UI, inclusion of dynamic weather, new innovative dynamic racing surface technology, improvements to the AI logic and a new force feedback system with lower input lag and much faster and more direct steering rack forces, along the lines of the popular third party developed RealFeel plug-in for rFactor. On January 10, 2012, the first open beta was released and it went out of beta since early 2013.  Future development  On September 16, 2016 at Simracing Expo, ISI announced a deal with Luminis, a software company based in the Netherlands that has already had experience with racing simulators having supported Reiza Studios in the development of Automobilista. This partnership brings the development of rFactor 2 in a new company called Studio 397. Studio 397 managing director Marcel Offermans stated that a lot of new features will be implemented in the game, including a more web-based UI, a DirectX 11 compatible graphics engine and the VR support for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Moreover, a new \\"paid-content system\\" would allow ISI to add more licensed content to the simulator. In October, Studio 397 released information about the new content. The developers announced they have acquired the license of U.S. F2000 National Championship, Radical Sportscars and NOLA Motorsports Park. The new rFactor 2 version will be available only on Steam. Features Cars As with its predecessor, many default vehicles are available to download. The long list of cars includes Formula One cars, GT cars, touring cars, stock cars and vans. There are also quads and Formula RC cars available as experimental content.  Tracks  A list of default tracks is available but not all of them are licensed. The range of racing venues includes permanent, oval, rally, and street circuits.  Real Road  Real Road is one of the most prominent features of rFactor 2. Rubber is dynamically laid on the track surface in real time during a race session by the player and the AI. The rubber can carry over to the next sessions and this calls for the player to constantly having to adapt to the advancing track conditions during a race weekend which in a dry race weekend means more and more available grip throughout. The player can choose from various rubber presets to start with or just choose to start the weekend on a completely green track. Real Road can be accelerated, left at a normal rate, or be completely static. The feature also creates grip-affecting marbles outside of the normal racing line. Real Road also works together with wet weather. When rain hits the track, the previously built-up rubber and marbles is washed away and the track will then need to be rubbered in again. The wet track surface dries dynamically similar to the aforementioned rubber build-up due to both cars on track as well as temperature, sun and wind. The Real Road system of rFactor 2 is unique because it is not scripted, but completely dynamic.  Tires  rFactor 2 also features realistic tire wear and damage. This punishes the player for locking up the brakes because a flatspot will occur with force feedback vibrations (tire suddenly has edges instead of being perfectly round) and a car imbalance (due to the lost weight of the burnt off tire). Until the tires are changed during a pit stop, the car will feel imbalanced and uncomfortable to drive. Using bad driving techniques will also punish the player with tires overheating and wearing unevenly. Tire punctures are also featured though not visually represented in-game.  AI  The AI of rFactor 2 is highly advanced and much improved over the first rFactor. It has spatial awareness, adjustable strength and aggression sliders and has the ability to \\"learn\\" better racing lines around a track resulting in better lap times. The AI can also be allowed to take control over the player's car. rFactor 2 is unique in that it is capable of races with over 100 AI opponents and you can also mix AI opponents with real drivers during online multiplayer races.  Other features  Also featured in rFactor 2 is a full day-to-night cycle with lighting transitions which can be set to real-time or accelerated. Fuel usage and visual as well as mechanical damage are also featured in the simulator, along with a \\"resume from replay\\" feature where any saved replay can be loaded and the player can then choose to resume driving at any point during that replay. Modding rFactor 2 is designed specifically to be modded. It is the first race sim with a dedicated mod packaging system and with the Steam release it will be the first with Steam Workshop integration. 24 Hours of Le Mans Virtual The game was used for the 2020 Le Mans race.

Around the year 20 AD, they established a well-known villa north of Flerzheim in the 4th Century but was destroyed. Today's Flerzheim was founded in 807 AD. Under the Bonn-law, Flerzheim was recognized on 1 January 1969 as a district on the Rhine river. Flerzheim is retained as a separate village as part of the town Rheinbach; however, the phone prefix number is the town of Meckenheim (02225).  Transportation  The bus line 800 of Bonn / Rhine river of regional Cologne Buservice (RVK) provides links to other safe places. Also located within 5 kilometers of 3 stops the Voreifel train from Bonn to Euskirchen. In the city, the country's roads 113 and 163 meet. Two highways run west in the vicinity: the A61 is 2 km away and the A565 east 4 km away.

Grotzinger John P. Grotzinger is the Fletcher Jones Professor of Geology at California Institute of Technology and chair of the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences. His works primarily focus on chemical and physical interactions between life and the environment. In addition to biogeological studies done on Earth, Grotzinger is also active in research into the geology of Mars and has made contributions to NASA's Mars Exploration Program.http://zipcodemars.jpl.nasa.gov/bio-contribution- missions.cfm?bid=162&cid;=157&pid;=158&page;=&country;_id=0&state;_id=0 Academic history *B.S., Hobart College, 1979 *M.S., University of Montana, 1981 *Ph.D., Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 1985 *Post- doc, Columbia University, 1985-1987 *Professor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1987-2005 *Jones Professor, California Institute of Technology, 2005‚Äìpresent Studies on Mars John Grotzinger is involved in several planetary missions. He was Project Scientist for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover mission, a Participating Scientist for the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, and a Participating Scientist for the High Resolution Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera, on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). Grotzinger has made significant contributions to understanding the early environmental history of Mars, as preserved within its record of sedimentary rocks. A long-standing goal of Mars environmental studies has been to understand the role of water throughout its geologic history. The presence of water is an indicator of potential habitability as well as of formerly different climatic conditions. Prior to in situ investigations by the Mars Exploration Rovers, most studies of water-related processes had been based on orbiter analysis of geomorphic and spectroscopic attributes. However, we can now directly examine the record of past surface processes, including the role of water, through sedimentologic studies of the stratigraphic record of Mars. Many processes that operate at a planetary surface have the potential to create a record of sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks can provide clues that allow past environmental conditions to be reconstructed. Therefore, the detection of sediment transport by water and wind in ancient sedimentary layers is important, because it provides insight into past climatic regimes and potential habitability. The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover was launched on Saturday, November 26, 2011 on board an Atlas V-541 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rover landed in Gale Crater on August 5, 2012. Curiosity's mission is to determine the planet's habitability and has been doing this using a suite of sophisticated instruments including cameras, spectrometers, environmental sensors, sample collection tools, and laboratory-quality geochemical instruments. Curiosity landed at the foot of Mt. Sharp ‚Äì Gale Crater's central mound ‚Äì near the end of an ancient alluvial fan that formed by sediments transported by streams from the crater rim. In the first year of its mission, Curiosity discovered fine-grained sedimentary rocks of basaltic composition that represent an ancient lake and preserve evidence of an environment that would have been suited to support a Martian biosphere founded on chemolithoautotrophy. This aqueous environment was characterized by neutral pH, low salinity, and variable redox states of both iron and sulfur species. C, H, N, O, S, and P were measured directly as key biogenic elements. The environment likely had a minimum duration of hundreds to tens of thousands of years, and could have existed for millions of years. These results highlight the biological viability of fluvial-lacustrine environments in the post-Noachian history of Mars. Co-evolution of Earth's early environment and biosphere Grotzinger has made major contributions to the fields of Geobiology and Paleontology. Beginning in 1993, Grotzinger and his colleagues began a research program aimed at understanding the chronology of major biological and environmental events leading up to, and perhaps driving early Cambrian radiation of metazoans. The so-called Cambrian explosion of biodiversity was shown to have been much more rapid than previously understood. It also may have followed an extinction event of earlier organisms that pioneered and experimented with calcification. More recent research over the past decade has been based on understanding carbon and sulfur isotope ratios in carbonate sediments of Ediacaran age. This work proposed that vertical circulation of ocean water led to oxygenation of the deep ocean shortly before the end of the Proterozoic time, which may also have contributed to the rise in biodiversity in early Cambrian time. The Shuram carbon isotopic excusion - the largest known in Earth history - has been the subject of intensive research at Caltech. Measurement of the carbon isotope ratios in ancient carbonate rocks provides the principal basis by which the fluxes of reduced and oxidized carbon are determined over the course of Earth's history. Globally distributed carbonate rocks of middle Ediacaran age (ca. 600-560 million years ago) record the largest carbon isotope excursion in Earth history, suggesting dramatic reorganization of Earth's carbon cycle. The Shuram Excursion closely precedes impressive evolutionary events including the rise of large metazoans and the origin of biomineralization in animals. Combining his expertise in sedimentology and geobiology, Grotzinger's research on stromatolites shows that they are vital tools in understanding the interactions between ancient microorganisms and their environment. Stromatolites are attached, lithified sedimentary growth structures, accretionary away from a point or limited surface of initiation. Though the accretion process is commonly regarded to result from the sediment trapping or precipitation-inducing activities of microbial mats, only rarely is evidence of this process preserved in Precambrian stromatolites. Grotzinger's research has applied a process-based approach, oriented toward deconvolving the replacement textures of ancient stromatolites. The effects of diagenetic recrystallization first must be accounted for, followed by analysis of lamination textures and deduction of possible accretion mechanisms. Accretion hypotheses can be tested using numerical simulations based on modern stromatolite growth processes. Application of this approach has shown that stromatolites were originally formed largely through in situ precipitation of laminae during Archean and older Proterozoic times, but that younger Proterozoic stromatolites grew largely through the accretion of carbonate sediments, most likely through the physical process of microbial trapping and binding. This trend most likely reflects long-term evolution of the earth's environment rather than microbial communities.

Staging the Emperor's New Clothes: Dress-Codes and Nation-Building under Reza Shah, Iranian Studies, v.26, 3-4 The hat (to be worn with a European-style coat and trousers) was cylindrical with a peak, being based on the French military kepi, and was available in black or beige. The hat's peak, by obstructing the touching of the forehead to the ground during prayer, was seen as an attempt to reduce the influence of religious ritual in Iranian society (although unlike brimmed European hats it could be turned around for prayer), while its introduction across the whole of society served to efface distinctions in dress amongst different ethnic groups (the Armenians in particular objected to being made to wear it). Although widely adopted in cities, the Pahlavi hat was initially perceived as 'foreign' and proved deeply unpopular. In April 1930, the Ruler of the Trucial State of Dubai, Sheikh Saeed Al Maktoum, notified Persian residents of the emirate that they should not wear the Pahlavi hat and that 'those who wish to wear it should return to Persia.'Summary of the News from the Arab States for the Month of April 1930.

He was awarded the honorary title of People's Artist of the Azerbaijan SSR. Biography Young Azim Azimzade Reichstag Azim Azimzade was born on 7 May 1880 in the village of Novxanƒ± in the Baku Governorate of the Russian Empire which is now present-day Azerbaijan. The son of an oil industry worker, he had four siblings, each of whom died before the age of 10. Azimzade received no artistic education and was self-educated; in 1906 he began publishing paintings concerning social and political issues in magazines which represented the beginning of Azerbaijani satirical graphic art. Azimzade also actively participated in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and was the manager of the Department of Cultural Enlightenment of the People's Commissariat of Azerbaijan. After the revolution, Azimzade published a variety of works, including a book, easel graphics, book illustrations, paintings for satirical magazines and newspapers, drafts of costumes, decorations, political caricatures and posters. Nearly half of all the posters made by Azimzade contained anti-religious themes, however he also drew posters with a more political theme, such as one published in 1925 which portrays a peasant with a fork throwing a plunderer of the nation's property away from a village. His development of caricatures is closely related to the satirical Molla Nasraddin magazine, which was founded under ideas of the first Russian Revolution in 1905 and subsequently revived after the Russian Revolution in 1917. Azimzade worked closely with editor Jalil Mammadguluzadeh and published many illustrations and would become the chief artist of Molla Nasraddin. In 1923, he became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1927, Azimzade was awarded the honorary title of People's Artist of the Azerbaijani SSR. It is believed that he evaded political repressions due to his acquaintance with Mir Jafar Baghirov, who was the first secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist Party and an admirer of Azimzade's work. Azimzade created 56 colored lithographs for the collected works of poet Mirza Alakbar Sabir, as well as pictures for works of Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev, Nariman Narimanov and Huseyngulu Sarabski. In 1927, Azimzade drew the illustrations for the children's fairy tales found in the Wild Ox poems of G.K. Sanily. In the 1930s, Azimzade completed a thematic series of watercolors which examined social inequality, such as Wedding of the Rich People and Wedding of the Poor People. In 1933, Azimzade exhibited posters in Moscow for the first time, at an exhibition of Azerbaijani artists, which were well regarded by the central press. In 1937, he published a collection of 26 paintings entitled Shadows of the Past. During the beginning of World War II, Azimzade actively participated in the creation of the Agitokon posters written in both Azerbaijani and Russian with other Soviet artists. Writers and poets such as S. Rahman, Y. Fidler, G. Stroganov, M. Seyidzade and Nigar Rafibeyli also collaborated with the artists on the posters. Azimzade would make a significant contribution to Soviet wartime anti-fascist caricatures and drew more than 50 caricatures during the first two years of the war. One notable caricature Azimzade drew was called Lion and Kitten (1941), in which a caricature Adolf Hitler was ridiculed and compared to Napoleon, referencing the results of the Battle of Borodino in 1812. Azimzade died in 1943 at the age of 63. Legacy Baku is now home to the House-Museum of Azim Azimzade. A street in Baku, a museum, and the Artistic School of Azerbaijan, where Azimzade once taught and was director from 1932 to 1937, were all named in his honor.

Somerset County Cricket Club is one of the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship, representing the historic county of Somerset. The club was established in August 1875 and has played first-class cricket since 1882,Powell (2003), pp. 278‚Äì280. List A cricket since 1963, and Twenty20 cricket since 2003. Unlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within the county for home matches, although the use of minor \\"out grounds\\" has diminished since the 1980s. Somerset have played first class, List A, or Twenty20 matches at eighteen different grounds. Somerset's first home first-class match was against Hampshire in 1882 at the County Ground, Taunton. This ground is the headquarters of the county club, and has hosted more Somerset matches than any other ground. It was originally known as the Taunton Athletic Ground, and featured a cycling/running track around the outside of the playing area which was later removed. Prior to the cessation of cricket during the First World War, Somerset only played at three other grounds; two in Bath, and Clarence Park in Weston-super-Mare. The Recreation Ground in Bath, the home ground of Bath Rugby,Powell (2003), p. 288. has been a regular setting for Somerset, hosting over 300 county matches. It is also Somerset's only venue other than the County Ground to have hosted a Twenty20 match. Clarence Park also frequently hosted Somerset matches until 1996, and has featured over 200 Somerset games. The next most frequently used ground is Morlands Athletic Ground in Glastonbury, where Somerset played 24 times between 1952 and 1978. After the First World War, Somerset began playing in a wider variety of locations around the county, including three different grounds in Yeovil, and also hosted five matches at the Recreation Ground in Torquay, despite that being in Devon. They played in three different grounds in Bristol, which has been considered an independent county since 1373, though it was part of the county of Avon from 1974 until 1996, and where Gloucestershire County Cricket Club have their headquarters.Powell (2003), p. 106. After 1979, Somerset only played at the County Ground, the Recreation Ground and Clarence Park until 2012, when they faced Cardiff MCC University at Taunton Vale, their first new ground in 37 years. Somerset have not played a county match outside of Taunton since 2011, when they faced Essex in a Twenty20 match in Bath. Grounds Below is a complete list of grounds used by Somerset County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2020 season.

It currently serves in the Surveillance and Target Acquisition role and is equipped with various weapon platform locating equipment using radars and acoustic sound ranging assets. History K Battery was formed by the East India Company as 2nd Troop Bengal Horse Artillery on 4 August 1809 in Acra, India, with the majority of the other ranks being British. This fact and that the battery were all mounted to ensure greater manoeuvrability, was unusual during this period. During the next 100 years the battery came under command of the Bengal Horse Artillery then the Royal Horse Artillery and is now under command of the Royal Artillery. In 1939, K Battery was the last Royal Horse Artillery battery to be mechanised. At outbreak of the Second World War, K Battery was the current Riding Troop at St Johns Wood, and the battery joined 5th RHA, serving alongside G Battery, as part of the British Expeditionary Force during the Fall of France, consisting of D, E and F Troops. It was during the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940 with the British Expeditionary Force, that the battery gained its honour title. With the BEF retreating towards the Belgian coast as the German forces streamed through Belgium, the small village of Hondeghem lay on one of the Germans' main lines of advance and it became essential to hold it. However, the only troops available were K Battery and a detachment of one officer and 80 men of the 2nd Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery. The battery was armed with First World War Mark II 18-pounder guns which had been modernised by the fitting of road wheels and pneumatic tyres. Two of the guns of 'F' Troop were situated inside the village and the other two on the outskirts of the village. At about 07:30 on the morning of the 27 May the enemy, in the form of 6th Panzer Division, appeared and were engaged by the two outer guns. These guns destroyed several enemy vehicles and two or three tanks as they approached. An enemy tank closed on gun of J Sub Section firing its machine gun, the number 2 was killed. The tank then fired its main armament and scored a direct hit killing another member of the detachment and wounding Gunner Manning and Troop Sergeant Major Opie. Small arms fire poured into the gun pit wounding Gunner Manning again, but he gallantly insisted on remaining in action. The enemy tank was then engaged by the gun of I Sub Section just before it was destroyed while enemy infantry dashed in and captured the last few men of J Sub Section. Gunner Manning was taken to hospital by the Germans but died later of his injuries. The battle then surged into the streets of the village, with continuous, violent and sometimes confused street fighting was carried out for the next eight hours. The two remaining guns kept firing throughout at a very reduced range, as the Germans tried to establish machine guns in the upper windows of the houses. Throughout the day, as the battle continued, the guns were constantly being moved to fresh targets firing at 100 yards or less, but by 3pm the gun ammunition began running short, so the artillerymen used their rifles to fire at any Germans who showed their heads. Then at 4:15pm it was decided to try to save the last two guns and the survivors of the small force headed towards St Sylvestre, where the village was found to be occupied by the Germans with both infantry and medium tanks. It was now that the troop commander decided that the best course of action was to charge the enemy without delay. So at his command every man shouted at the top of their voice and assaulted the German position. The Germans lost their nerve and ran. After firing what little ammunition they had into the surrounding countryside, the little column resumed its retreat. The battery had suffered heavy losses, with 'F' Troop alone losing 45 men out of 63. However, they were rewarded with Major Hoare being awarded the D.S.O., Captain Teacher the M.C., Battery Sergeant Major Millard receiving the D.C.M., and Gunner Kavanagh was honoured with the M.M. In addition three men were Mentions-In-Despatches. After evacuation at Dunkirk the battery was rebuilt, with men from it going to help form CC Battery, as part of the re-organisation of the Royal Artillery, with the battery consisting of D and E/F Troops. It then, served along with G Battery and CC Battery, in 5th RHA, originally sailing to the Middle East as part of 8th Armoured Division, before 5 RHA joined 7th Armoured Division. It served in North Africa, Italy and North West Europe.

The film was Mahesh Manjrekar's 17th film, having previously directed critically acclaimed films such as Astitva and Viruddh... Family Comes First. It was adapted from Jayant Pawar's Marathi play, Adhantar, with Pawar going on to co-write the film's screenplay. The film explores the life of Mumbai's mill workers after the Mumbai mills shut down in response to the Great Bombay Textile Strike of the early 1980s. The film opened to mixed reviews, though it was commended for its themes, and acting. The name of the Marathi version of this film is Lalbaug Parel, while the Hindi version was released as City of Gold. Plot The film is the story of a family of mill workers in Mumbai. It follows the workers as politics and greed rise in Mumbai and exposes the collusion between the triumvirate of big business, the political establishment and the trade union leaders who ostensibly were charged with protecting the rights of the mill workers. Baba Dhudu narrates his story to his fiance. He is a son of a mill worker & has 2 brothers, Naru & Mohan & a sister Manju. Along with his parents, they stay in a congested locality of Parel. Mohan has a regular job as an accountant, while Naru & Baba are jobless. Naru is a local strongman & bashes anyone who crosses him or his friends. Baba aspires to be a professional playwright & spends time in writing, which his family despises as this does not bring any income for the family. His father is retired from the mill & fighting for his retirement dues from the mill which is on verge of closing down. The mill is managed son-in- law of the owner Mr Khaitan, who is a very hard-nosed selfish person. His aim is the close down the mill & establish real estate business over the mill land, which is worth gold in today's market. In order to covert the mill into a commercial complex, he needs NOC from the mill workers as well as their resignation letters. Mill workers are adamant over their dues & not willing to sacrifice their jobs. Rane & Govind are their leaders & Dr Sawant is union leader & fights the legal battle for the mill workers. Govind is short- tempered & always willing to physically fight with the owners, while Rane is practical & feels legal recourse is the best way to get justice. The mill workers are fighting for dues of 6 months & one fine day it is announced that the mill would be closed down. Mill workers go on strike & local politician gets involved. Meanwhile, Naru gets involved with local don Parshya Bhai & starts running errands for him along with his friends. Mohan who is a hardcore cricket buff one fine day syphons off Rs. 25,000 from his company to bet on a match which he loses. Baba rescues him from the police after settling the dues by selling his kidney, unknown to his family. Manju becomes pregnant & is distraught when she comes to know that her lover is already married. Her father gets paralytic attack due to this & is bedridden. He requests Rane to marry his daughter, which he accepts. The local politician intervenes & mill workers agree to give NOC, but not resignation & it is decided that a part of the mill would be restored. But the very night when the mill is supposed to resume, it is blown away by an explosion, presumably by the owner. Now nothing in hand, the mill workers sit on a strike. Things go from bad to worse & they start selling off their personal possessions to survive. Some of the ladies get into prostitution, while kids get into mugging. There is a constant face- off between owners & mill workers. In a fit of rage one fine day, Govind assaults brother-in-law of the owner. He is enraged at this action & hires Parshya Bhai to kill Govind. Parshya Bhai assigns the task to Naru but doesn't tell him who the target is. Naru shoots Govind dead, only to realise later that he has shot down the father of his best friend 'Speedbreaker'. Naru goes into hiding. Later his father dies out of the shock of the news. Naru later confronts Parshya Bhai who tricked him by not paying his share of the contract. He kills him with the help of his friends. Naru is in turn killed by Speedbreaker & he takes over the gang of Parshya Bhai. The mill owner finally comes up with some cash & mill workers give in & agree to sign required legal documents for a very small part of their original compensation. Rane is distraught that just as the court is about to give it's verdict, the owners have tricked them taking advantage of their desperate situation. Sometime later Baba finally achieves his dream of a becoming a professional playwright & is about to take his mother to the first show of his play. His mother is overwhelmed by his success & after a long hard life, she finally sees some hope. When she reads his name in the newspaper she dies out of shock. Baba finishes his narration & takes his finance to meet all the characters he had narrated in his story. Rane is still delusional that he will win the legal battle, rest of them have got their lives back on track & Speedbreaker runs his gang along with his friends. Production The director of the film Mahesh Manjrekar writes in the director notes: > \\"When I took a sabbatical from Hindi cinema close to four years ago, I > promised myself that if and only if an exceptional subject came my way would > I venture back to do a Hindi film. Lalbaug Parel is that subject.\\" After completing the script in 2007, Manjrekar decided to wait until he could find a producer who would be willing to do a film without musical numbers. Eventually, DAR Motion Pictures produced the film. Legal troubles After the film's release the family of Dutta Samant served Mahesh Manjrekar with legal notice, claiming that the film wrongly placed the blame for the mills' closure on Samant. They also objected to Manjrekar's portrayal of the mill workers' children, saying they were shown as \\"goons\\".

Battery history Q Battery, Royal Horse Artillery was originally raised in Poona, India on 1 March 1824 as 3rd Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery, part of the Bombay Presidency Army of the Honourable East India Company. Between 1838 and 1857 the troop saw action in the first Anglo-Afghan War, the First Anglo-Sikh War, the Second Anglo-Sikh War, and the Anglo-Persian War. In 1858 the battery saw service during the Indian mutiny. On 19 February 1862, the Bombay Horse Artillery transferred to the Royal Artillery, specifically as its 4th Horse Brigade.}} and 3rd Troop became C Battery, 4th Horse Brigade, RA. A reorganization of artillery regiments on 13 April 1864 saw 1st Brigade split as A and B Brigades, 2nd Brigade become C Brigade, 3rd become D, 4th become E, and 5th become F Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery. As the battery's designation was tied to the brigade it was assigned to, it was redesignated on the same date as C Battery, E Horse Brigade, RA. From 1866, the term \\"Royal Horse Artillery\\" appeared in Army List hence the battery was designated C Battery, E Brigade, RHA from about this time. Between 1864 and 1889 the battery's title changed a further five times. In 1889 the battery assumed the title of Q Battery Royal Artillery. The battery next saw service in the Boer war between 1899 and 1901. On 31 March 190,0 the battery assisted the majority of General Broadwater's force from a vicious Boer ambush at Koorn Spruit, near Sanna's Post. In 1926, the battery was granted the honour title \\"Sanna's Post\\". During the First World War the Battery saw continuous action on the western front. At the end of the Great War the battery's name changed again twice before being renamed Q Battery Royal Field Artillery in 1924.

BTI is located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, United States, and is fully integrated in the research infrastructure of the University. Faculty at BTI are members of several Cornell Departments, including Plant Biology, Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Molecular Biology & Genetics, as well as Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology. BTI is governed by a Board of Directors, which is in part appointed by Cornell. BTI main entrance History William Boyce Thompson, who acquired wealth in the copper mining industry, visited Russia in 1917 where he saw the effects of hunger on its inhabitants. This trip persuaded Thompson of the importance of ensuring food supply for the world population, and in 1920, he decided to establish the Institute for Plant Research. He wanted the institute to further the understanding of plants, to use this understanding for improving world food supply, and to promote conservation of natural areas. Yonkers The Yonkers building in 2009 Thompson named the institute in honor of his parents, Anne Boyce Thompson and William Thompson, and endowed it with $10 million. Subsequently, the BTI has been funded by government support and revenues from the licensing of institute patents. Thompson played an active role in the early years of BTI and sought to encourage commercial development of the institute's research results. Because Thompson sought an active role, rather than locate BTI on the campus of an existing university, in 1924, Thompson built the initial laboratories across the street from his country estate Alder Manor, in Yonkers, New York.Hudson Valley Ruins: Alder Manor by Rob Yasinsac; hudsonvalleyruins.org The Yonkers campus, used by BTI until the 1970s, was leased out and used as late as 1997, and was later sold to the City of Yonkers Board of Education in 1999. In 2015 the City of Yonkers sold the property for $4.25 million to Simone Development Cos. The plans for the campus are to re- develop it into a mixed-use center with medical offices, restaurants and retail stores. Cornell University BTI remained on its Yonkers campus until the 1970s, when Yonkers property taxes and urban pollution posed major problems. Managing Director George L. McNew favored an affiliation with a major research university, and soon a 'bidding war' broke out between Oregon State University and Cornell University to attract BTI. The New York State Legislature wanted to keep BTI in New York and appropriated $8.5 million for construction of facilities on the Cornell campus if BTI agreed to stay. Oregon also appropriated funds as a relocation incentive. Ultimately, it was decided that affiliation with Cornell offered the most varied research opportunities. In 1978 a new building designed by Ulrich Franzen was built next to the Cornell Veterinary School, and the move was made.Boyce Thompson Institute - Facility Information , cornell.edu Although affiliated with Cornell, the institute maintains its independence with a separate endowment, Board of Directors, business office, and employee benefits program. Close ties between BTI and Cornell foster collaborative relationships.Cornell.edu In 2015, in an effort to revamp the brand, the organisation officially renamed itself from Boyce Thompson Institute of Plant Research to Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI). Programs BTI has 15 faculty investigators conducting plant research and training graduate students and post doctoral fellows.

Louis-Fran√ßois Cassas (June 3, 1756 ‚Äì November 1, 1827) was a distinguished French landscape painter, sculptor, architect, archeologist and antiquary born at Azay-le- Ferron, in the Indre Department of France. His father was an artisan in the office of the \\"Ponts et Chauss√©s\\", and Cassas followed him there as an apprentice draughtsman when he was only fifteen years old.  Life  As the godson of the Marquis Louis-Fran√ßois de Gallifet, owner of the Ch√¢teau d'Azay- le-Ferron, where Cassas were born,Jean-Paul Cl√©ment, Chateaubriand en Orient: exposition pr√©sent√©e √† la Maison de Chateaubriand, pg. 339, Maison de Chateaubriand (2005), his artistic education was very eclectic. He studied in Tours and Paris before traveling to Rome. His teachers included Joseph-Marie Vien (1716‚Äì1809), a Neo-classical painter and teacher to Jacques-Louis David (1748‚Äì1825), Louis Jean Fran√ßois Lagren√©e the younger (1739‚Äì1821), as well as Roccoco painters such as Jean-Baptiste Le Prince (1734‚Äì1781). In 1778 Cassas went to Rome, Venice, Naples and Sicily where he spent the first years of his youth in the study of ancient monuments. A commission by \\"une societe d'amateurs des beaux arts\\" in 1782 took him from Istria to southern Dalmatia, to make a series of illustrations of the antiquities on the east Adriatic coast.

Hemss, jadis √âm√®se, where Cassas represented himself drawing (Voyage pittoresque de la Syrie, 1799, plate 20) From 1784 to 1786, Cassas lived and worked at the French embassy. In 1784 he accompanied the Count Choiseul-Gouffier, the French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, on his mission to Constantinople. Commissioned by him, he travelled from 1784 to 1787 engaged in making drawings for the Ambassador's second volume of Voyage pittoresque de la Gr√®ce, published in 1809.J. Thomas, Universal Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and Mythology Part One, pg. 535, Kessinger Publishing, LLC (2005), He visited Egypt from October to December 1785, and drew the antiquities of Alexandria, the pyramids of Giza and the mosques of Cairo. Shortly afterwards he made several drawings of Palmyra, in the desert of Syria, visited the Holy Land and illustrated the ruins of Baalbec in Lebanon. He also painted Palestine, Cyprus and Asia Minor, drawing ancient Middle Eastern sites, many of which had never been recorded. Etching after Louis-Fran√ßois Cassas showing an imagined caravan arriving at the ancient site of Palmyra, Syria. Created ca. 1799. At the beginning of the French Revolution, the artist returned to France via Rome, arriving in Paris in 1792. The result of his labours then appeared in the Voyage Pittoresque de la Syrie, de la Phenicie, de la Palestine, et de la Basse Egypte, which he began publishing in 1799. The originals of his works in oil paintings for both voyages were deposited in the Biblioth√®que Royale. Many of the preliminary drawings for the published etchings in Voyage are held in the collections of the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne, and a publication archive‚Äîwhich includes proof-plates and a manuscript detailing Cassas‚Äô journey‚Äîis held by the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles. At the turn of the eighteenth to nineteenth century, the artist had already combined his first observations of Egyptian monuments in a series of paintings which were very influential on many artists and stage designers in the early decades of the nineteenth century.Jean-Marcel Humbert, C.

After his death Cassas was largely forgotten and his work was greatly neglected. In 1973, the government of Yugoslavia paid homage to Cassas issuing a postage stamp of the city of Split from one of his 1782 etchings called Vue de Spalatro et du Lazareth.  Works  As an architect, he was occupied many years in forming a large collection of 745 architectural models of ancient monuments in cork and terracotta in almost every kind of style, from many countries and epochs. They were exhibited in 1806, along with engravings of the original sites and present-day ruins behind them. Eventually, he came to disposed of them for a small annuity to the imperial government for the general use of the public.Jeremy D.

Besides his architectural and archaeological drawings and sketches, he drew numerous costumes studies, views and processions, as well as scenes from daily life, plants and animals of all sorts. He also exhibited views of his travels at the \\"Salons\\", which were periodic art exhibitions sponsored by the French Acad√©mie Royale, in 1804 and 1814, and published Picturesque views of the Principal Sites and Monuments of Greece, of Sicily, and of the Seven Hills of Rome, of which thirty parts had already been published by 1813.

Life The son of Thomas Watts of Buntingford, Hertfordshire, he was owner of the Margaret and John, one of the ships paid by the city of London in 1588 to sail against the Spanish armada. Watts himself served in her as a volunteer, and saw action. In 1590 the same ship was one of a fleet of merchantmen coming home from the Mediterranean, which successfully fought and repelled the Spanish galleys near Cadiz. Although Watts was not on board, throughout the war he equipped and financed privateers led by Michael Geare, William Lane and Christopher Newport. A few of his notable successes include his financed and organised expedition to the Spanish main in 1590, the expedition to Cuba the following year and James Lancaster's expedition to Recife in April 1595. Watt's received significant prize money from the success of these expeditions. Another in July 1601 took into Plymouth a prize coming from the Indies laden with China silks, satins and taffetas. At this time he was an alderman of London (Tower ward), and had been suspected of being a supporter of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. He was one of the founders of the East India Company, and on 11April 1601 was elected its governor, during the imprisonment of Sir Thomas Smythe. He served as a Sheriff of the City of London in 1597. On the accession of James I he was knighted on 26July 1603, becoming Lord Mayor of London in 1606‚Äì1607, at which time he was described in a letter to the king of Spain as \\"the greatest pirate that has ever been in this kingdom\\".Bicheno p. 314 During the following years he was an active member of the Virginia Company. In the city of London, Watts was a member of the Clothworkers' Company. Watts died at his seat in Hertfordshire in September 1616, and was buried on the 7th of the month at Ware. Family By his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir James Hawes, knt. (lord mayor in 1574), he left four sons and four daughters. The eldest son, John, served in the Cadiz expedition and was knighted for his good service in 1625; he subsequently served under George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham in the Rh√© expedition, and under Count Mansfeldt in the Electorate of the Palatinate; he married Mary, daughter of Thomas Bayning, and aunt of Paul Bayning, 1st Viscount Bayning, and left numerous issue. His eldest son (grandson of the lord mayor), who also became Sir John Watts, served an apprenticeship in arms under his father. He was knighted in 1642, and received a commission to raise a troop of arms for the king. Having been expelled from the governorship of Chirk Castle, he attached himself to Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham, and was one of the defenders of Colchester Castle (August 1648). He compounded for delinquency by paying a fine, and was discharged on 11May 1649; however, he was forced to sell to Sir John Buck his manor of Mardocks in Ware. After the Restoration he was made receiver for Essex and Hertfordshire. He died about 1680, and was buried in the church of Hertingfordbury.

This included 5 Regiment RA whose role as part of the NATO General Development Plan (GDP) in the event of war, was to contribute to imposing delay on the advancing Warsaw Pact forces. Operating deep inside enemy territory, however, required specialist training only then undertaken by the Corps Patrol Unit, consisting of the Territorial Army SAS regiments and the HAC. By 1980, the Commanding Officer of 5th Regiment Royal Artillery, Lt Colonel A C P Stone, prepared a detailed paper setting out the case that the Regiment required special observation post soldiers.http://www.debretts.com/people-of-today/profile/9062/Anthony-Charles- Peter-STONE This new unit would dig underground shelters close to the Inner German Border and allow the advancing enemy forces to pass by them. Following this, two pairs of Gunners would emerge from each underground patrol shelter to direct the fire from the Regiment's artillery. In 1989, Captain D B Jones, suggested to his Commanding Officer, that there should only be one Special observation post organisation and that ideally it should be based back in Hildesheim near the operational deployment area. In April 1991, two troops were merged, forming 73 (Sphinx) Special OP Battery RA.https://www.orbat85.nl/documents/BAOR-July-1989.pdf see notes: p.13 (& p.12) Recent Deployments The battery deployed on Operation Herrick 7 where two personnel serving with the battery were killed in separate mine strike incidents,http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/CorporalDarrylGardinerKilledInAfghanistan.htmhttp://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/TrooperJackSadlerKilledInAfghanistan.htm as well as three seriously injured.

Origins Conchobar Maenmaige is agreed in all sources to have been king for forty years, so it appears he succeeded Tadhg Ua Cellaigh sometime after his abduction by an army from Munster in 1145. His succession meant the end of S√≠ol Anmchadha's brief independence and overlordship of U√≠ Maine, and its dynasty would henceforth be confined to their own homeland. Conchobar is stated in all the genealogies as being the son of Diarmaid, whose immediate descent is uncertain but is given as the son or grandson of Tadhg M√≥r Ua Cellaigh, who was killed at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. However, it may actually mean that he was the son or grandson of the Tadhg who was abducted in 1145.

The Taikatsu studio was located in Yokohama, below the Bluff and the Foreigner's Cemetery (a memorial tablet currently marks the site).

To provide the correct power output heating or cooling devices require a certain flow known as the design flow. Theoretically it is possible to design plants that deliver the design flow at each terminal unit (heating or cooling device). In reality this is not possible because pipes and valves only come in certain sizes and accurately predicting the real flow in a system is too complex. Some circuits (typically those closest to the pump) will be favoured by higher than required flows at the expense of other circuits that will have underflows. In small heating systems (e.g. domestic systems) balancing is quite easy because of the small number of terminal units and relatively simple distribution network. Balancing can normally be achieved by simply pre-setting the flow through the radiators. Larger buildings, such as offices or hospitals, have a more complicated heating and cooling system and require a more accurate balancing technique. To obtain a plant with the correct design flows, consultants design systems to include balancing valves, differential pressure controllers or pressure independent control valves. Balancing valves allow the measurement of differential pressures which can be used to calculate a flow. There are various balancing methods, but all involve measuring differential pressures and adjusting them to the correct value by calculating what flow that represents. Differential pressure controllers are usually membrane- or spring driven valves that control the differential pressures in the installation. This will simplify balancing procedures and enable the installation to be more precisely controlled. Pressure independent valves combine the balancing and control functions in one valve and work based on springs and/or membranes to precisely control the flows in the distribution network and as such need no measuring or balancing procedure. The reason for balancing the system and some basic information on how to do it  In a balanced system every radiator is set to receive the proper amount of fluid as designed in order to generate the required amount of heat. Heating engineers will usually do this as part of the installation of a brand new system, but they will rarely do it when replacing a component of the system, such as just the room thermostat or a part inside the boiler. They will check and adjust the balance if asked to do so, but as it can take about an hour to balance the radiators in an average sized three-bedroom house - and proportionally more or less for larger or smaller homes - many people don't want to pay for the time it takes to do the balancing properly. It is important to make sure that, when the room thermostat is calling for heat, all the radiators in the system heat up fully - to the maximum temperature possible - in sitting rooms and other daily \\"living\\" rooms but NOT in the other rooms (utility rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) which should be kept as cool as possible. This is easy to do if you have TRVs (thermostatically-controlled radiator valves) fitted to your radiators, but if you don't have TRVs, you should be sure to open the IN-FLOW valves fully in all living rooms and turn them almost fully off in the other rooms. (Keeping them open just an eighth- to a quarter- turn usually works.) When it gets cold outside many people go round the house to open both valves on their radiators fully, in the mistaken belief that they will get more heat. But all that does is un-balance the system. The result is that the radiators nearest to the boiler take most of the flow of hot water and the other radiators get very little flow at all. If the system is unbalanced, some rooms get too hot and others never get warm enough. Often the owners of unbalanced systems imagine this is because \\"the boiler is too old\\" or \\"the radiators are full of silt and need flushing out\\" and think that the cost of getting their system repaired would be so high that they do nothing about getting it fixed! Most often their problem will disappear if they call-in someone who knows how to balance all the radiators. Instead of letting your central heating system cool down completely, so that you often have to keep switching it on for a short time to give your home a big blast of heat, it is best to keep your central heating running continuously with the central wall-mounted thermostat set at the lowest temperature at which you feel comfortable. Doing this could save you money because you will not be wasting so much fuel, especially if your home is well insulated. Note: It is a sure sign that you have a faulty thermostat if you find that you continually have to turn the set temperature up by hand to get the system to start warming-up and then always have to turn that stat down again to stop the house getting too hot! You will be amazed how comfortable your home will be if you get that faulty thermostat replaced! Problems caused by improper balance In an unbalanced system there will always be favoured circuits that receive more water than they require. These favoured circuits steal flow from unfavoured circuits which will not then be able to provide the heating or cooling required. Control valves may temporarily help by gradually reducing the flow in favoured circuits, thus allowing unfavoured circuits to achieve the correct flow. This will however cause long delays in reaching the set temperature in the building after night setback and will make the installation very inefficient. Balancing limits the flow in favoured circuits, forcing water through unfavoured circuits. As a result, the required design flows are available to all circuits and the system can provide the required Indoor Air Quality. Avoiding overflows means the pump is not doing unnecessary work which saves energy, reduces operating cost and can reduce the size of the pump required (saves on initial pump investment). Balancing also saves energy and operating costs by reducing the amount of time between starting a plant and reaching the required indoor climate. For example, after every set back unbalanced plants must start earlier and run at maximum capacity for longer than balanced plants thereby using more energy. Methods Balancing an installation is a complicated and involved procedure because closing or throttling a valve will increase the flow in other parts of the installation. That is why a very structured procedure must be followed. The two most used methods are compensated balancing and proportional balancing. Both use an iterative methodology that will result in properly distributed flow in a full load situation. The complicated nature of these balancing procedures is the reason that automatic solutions are gaining traction, because it reduces or eliminates the need for complicated balancing procedures. Because of that, differential pressure controllers and pressure independent valves are getting more and more popular. Troubleshooting The act of balancing can reveal common glitches such as wrongly mounted terminal units, damaged pipes, back-to-front reversed check valves and blocked filters. Ideally, these flaws should be exposed while they can still be cheaply fixed. That is, before control equipment is commissioned, before ceilings are mounted, and most important, before tenants move in. After several years use, even the best-designed and best-built plants can suffer operational problems. A problem can have many causes: filters or valves may be clogged, terminal units and heat exchangers may have been replaced, a pipe may have been damaged during renovations, or a child's mischievous fingers may have left a shutoff valve half open. Balancing valves allow the measurement of differential pressure and temperature thereby pinpointing the cause of many such operational problems.

After the Treaty of the Union, the two countries continued to remain with their own legal systems including court structures. In the 1977 Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, the High Court of Tanganyika whose jurisdiction was and still is territoriality limited to Tanzania Mainland (formerly Tanganyika) was called the High Court of Tanzania and the High Court of Zanzibar retained its original name. It is essential to note that the High Court of Tanzania only has territorial jurisdiction over legal issues arising in Tanzania Mainland and the High Court of Zanzibar has territorial jurisdiction over legal issues arising in Zanzibar. The Courts in the United Republic of Tanzania are arranged in a simple and clear hierarchy containing superior courts and subordinate courts and a special constitutional court, which is formed only when there is a constitutional dispute arising between Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland. In the history of the Union of Zanzibar and Tanganyika a special Constitutional court has never been formed, despite open disagreements on the interpretation and nature of the Union. The Courts of the United Republic of Tanzania are established by the Constitution and municipal laws of Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland. In Tanzania Mainland, the High Court of Tanzania has three divisions, namely the Commercial Division (the Commercial Court), the Land Division (the Land Court) and the Labour Division (the Labour Court). On the other hand, Zanzibar only has one division of its High Court but is establishing a Commercial Division of the High Court of Zanzibar. The High Court of Zanzibar has a registry in Pemba and in Zanzibar, however, the registry in Pemba does not have a resident judge. The High Court of Tanzania has registries in Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Tanga, Arusha, Iringa, Bukoba, Dodoma, Mwanza, Mbeya, Mtwara, Tabora and all the registries have resident judges. The Court of Appeal of the United Republic of Tanzania The highest court of the United Republic of Tanzania is the Court of Appeal of the United Republic Tanzania which is a true union institution in that it has territorial jurisdiction over appeals arising from the High Court of Tanzania and the High Court of Zanzibar. Divisions of the High Court of Tanzania  The Commercial Court handles all commercial disputes. This Court was established through amendment of the High Court Registries Rules of 1984. The main objective of establishing this court was to ensure efficient management and expeditious disposal of commercial disputes so as to encourage business development under a free market economy and also growth of foreign investments. The Labour Court is responsible for hearing and determining employment disputes. It was first inaugurated and launched in June 2007 under the Employment and Labour Relations Act. The Land Court was established as a result of the land reforms which were implemented by the Land Act 1999. Until 2010, the Land Court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine land disputes relating to land with a pecuniary value of TZS 50,000 or more. Due to lack of sufficient manpower, including judges and the large number of cases being filed in the Land Court, the efficient and timely disposal of cases was negatively impacted. Consequently, in 2010, the Chief Justice of Tanzania, Augustino Ramadhani CJ, extended the jurisdiction to deal with land cases to all judges of the High Court. History The High Court of Tanzania is established under article 108(1) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania. It is the predecessor to the High Court of Tanganyika and later Tanzania, which was established under article 17 (1) of the Tanganyika order in council, 1920. The High Court is described as a superior court having full jurisdiction by virtue of section 2 (1) of the Judicature and Application of Laws Act, chapter 358 RE:2002. It has now developed forming a different structure to the former, where it has the ordinary court, and the two special divisions that is Commercial Division and Labour Division. However it is subject to the Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as stipulated under the constitution and any other written laws. The court is also known as a court of record where it is required to keep records of its own proceedings and that it may fine or imprison but also as a court of admiralty it can adjudicate disputes arising in the high seas and inland waters. Composition Having its base from the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, the High Court of Tanzania is composed of the principal judge and not less than 30 other judges. Judges of the High Court as provided by the Constitution are appointed by the President of the United Republic of Tanzania, in pursuant to the special qualifications stated in its article 109 (7) after consultation with the Judicial Service Commission established under part iii of the constitution. Formally the judges of the court were required to be not less than 15, compared to the recent changes of a composition of not less than 30 judges. The principal judge is a special assistant of the Chief Justice in the administration of the High court and courts which are subordinate to it. Provided under article 109 (3) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania. In addition to his ordinary power as a judge of the High Court, the principal judge is also empowered to perform all such duties and functions which in accordance with legal traditions applicable are matters to be performed by the head of the High Court. Assessors can be simply regarded as a panel of experts in determining an issue before the court. Assessors in the divisions of the High Court are selected from a list of experts submitted to the court by the specific court users committee and have to be knowledgeable in the field concerning the suit. Under article 27 (4) of the Magistrates Courts Act it provides that in any appeal a rule of customary law is in issue or relevant the High Court may refer any question of Customary law to a panel of experts and Also in section 265 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1985 it stipulates that all criminal trials before the court shall be with aid of two or more assessors as the court thinks fit. The divisions of the court are also properly constituted when presided over by a single judge sitting with two assessors; however where both parties to the case agree the judge in the commercial court can hear their case without aid of assessors. Jurisdiction The high court by virtue of section 2 (1) of the Judicature and Application of Laws Act is vested with full and unlimited Jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters, that is to say it shall have power over any matter not expressly provided by the law the constitution or any other law. It is also provided further under article 108(2) of the constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania. Such Jurisdiction is subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as stipulated under the constitution and any other written laws. In the light of article 108(2) of the constitution of the united republic and the provisions of the Judicature and Application of laws Act, the high court has original jurisdiction over all matters that are outside the jurisdiction of the courts subordinate to it. For example, proceedings where the value of the subject matter exceeds that of the district or resident magistrate courts, such cases are to be tried by the High Court. The High court also has original jurisdiction over all naval affairs or admiral matters. The high court has also exclusive original jurisdiction over all offences that are not triable by subordinate courts. The majority of these offences either carry capital punishment or life imprisonment, such offences include murder, manslaughter, infanticide, treason, inciting to mutiny and various other offences. The high court is vested with the appellate power in regard to determining matters submitted to it from subordinate courts, such an appeal may be from the Resident magistrate court or the district court. An appeal to the high court can be on points of law or on points of facts, or on both facts and law. An appeal can also be civil or criminal. Section 72 of the civil procedure code states that ‚Äúwhere a case is heard by a bench of two or more judges the appeal shall be decided in accordance with the opinion of the majority of such judges‚Äù. Powers Review The law allows any person who is aggrieved by any decision or order from which an appeal is allowed but no appeal has been made to apply for review of the order or decision made by a magistrate who passed the judgement. Review may also be applied for in circumstances where the party has no right to appeal so that a court can reverse its decision. According to the Order 42 rule 1(b) of the civil procedure code the applicant for review has to show that he or she discovered new or important matters or evidence. The judge to whom the application is made is free to alter his or her decision as he or she deems fit. A good example was in the case of Paul lema v Wilson chuwa (1989) where a high court judge reviewed his own order made in a matter arising from a suit to resist the sale of a house in a public auction. In an appeal the Court of Appeal held that a judge has power to review his own decision, but has no power to take a second look at his own decision given after review. Supervision and revision The high court is vested with general powers of supervision and revision over all districts courts and courts of resident Magistrates in the exercise of their appellate jurisdiction on matters originating from primary courts as well as in exercising their original jurisdiction. Where in exercise of such repower the high court may either call to inspect the record of any proceedings, direct any district court to call for and inspect the records of any proceedings in a primary court, or it can itself revise any such proceedings. Under the magistrate courts act if in any proceedings of a civil nature where it appears that there has been an error material to the merits of the case involving injustices, the high court may revise the proceedings and make such decision as it sees fit.. Conclusion Conclusively in the case of Northern Tanzania Farmers Coop society Ltd v Shelukindo the court stated that ‚ÄúThe high court is an organ deriving its establishment and existence by the operation of the constitution of this country. This organ unless otherwise expressly restricted by the legislature has unlimited criminal and civil jurisdiction, pecuniary and territorial jurisdiction apart from the court of appeal, it is the highest court for the administration of justice in this country.

It originally aired on ABC in the United States on February 10, 2010. Plot It's Fashion Week at Mode and Daniel helps Betty cover a low-priority show, this after Betty is singled out by Wilhelmina, who then gives her something else to do a story on, like the history of the sewing machine. However, thanks to a malfunction in Daniel's new Bluetooth headset that recorded a conversation between Daniel and Wilhelmina about Betty that later shows up on Betty's cellphone, Betty ends up giving Daniel the cold shoulder at work but she forgives him. Betty discovers a new designer called Marisa, and decides to help promote her as one of the '10 Designers to Watch', however she faces stiff competition from Marc, who gives her tips on how to pitch the designer to Wilhelmina. During the pitching, Marc does the talking while Betty plays Vanna White, but after winning over Wilhelmina, its Marc that ends up getting all the credit instead of Betty, leaving her furious with him for failing to give her credit. Amanda, jealous of Betty and Marc moving up in the world, teams up with Helen to create a new clothing line to make the list, but struggles to persuade Marc and Betty to lobby Wilhelmina on her behalf. Both Marc and Betty agree that even though Amanda and Helen have great ideas, they cannot pitch the idea to Wilhelmina and come clean to an upset Amanda. Daniel gets seduced into male modeling, which is spurred on by Wilhelmina who hopes to add more male models to the event after several of the females bail out. Claire's (Judith Light) son, Tyler, arrives in New York to find his mother, only to get sidetracked by Wilhelmina, who mistakes him for a male model and makes him part of the show, where he becomes the reason for Daniel's attempts to try to become a model. Daniel tries his best to walk, talk and act like a model, but realizes that at his age and with his excess weight that he is not cut out to be a model and opts out of the event. At the Suarez home, Ignacio brings home a huge chandelier from the restaurant, which seems to have problems, and Hilda tells Bobby she wishes her salon would be struck by lightning, so she can use the insurance money. However, just as Betty comes home later that afternoon, Marissa, feeling nervous about the event, asks Betty if she can leave her designs at the place. This is later followed by Amanda, who stops by that evening to apologize to Betty. When Marissa stops by to tell Betty that she wants to back out but Betty calms her down, the three see Bobby yelling after they smell smoke coming from the salon as the Suarez home mysteriously catches fire and Marissa's designs are ruined. Despite the damages, and thanks to a suggestion from Justin, Betty, Marissa and Amanda redesign the burned outfits to make them \\"Smokin' Hot\\", and Marissa's show is saved, although Wilhelmina ends up getting the credit for \\"discovering\\" Marissa. Also at the event, Helen tells Marc and Amanda that she got engaged to a guy she met during the show, while Betty and Marc reassure Amanda that she does have talent as a stylist. Just as Claire and Tyler discover each other at the event, Claire does come clean to Tyler afterwards, but tells him not to say anything about being her son yet. However, when Daniel sees Tyler talking to Claire, Claire lies to Daniel, who remarks that he is glad that he won't have to see Tyler again, which hurts Claire's feelings. As for that fire at the Suarez home, Bobby consoles Hilda and tells her that because of the fire that she will be able to collect the insurance. This put doubts into Hilda's head but unaware at the same time outside the house, just as Justin prepares to take out the trash... Justin takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter fluid from his jacket and puts them in the trash bag to cover his tracks. When Betty thanks Willhelmina for letting Marisa on the show and tells her that she hasn't been a fan of her taste, Willhelmina tells her she noticed Betty being afraid of her, comparing it to her experience with Fey Sommers. Willhelmina says she never doubted herself, reassures Betty that taste is having courage in your own convictions and compliments Betty's shoes, which match hers.

An entrance to the Green Park, one of the eight Royal Parks in central London, the gate was presented to London by Canada (then the senior Dominion of the British Empire) as part of a vast memorial scheme dedicated to Queen Victoria, who died in 1901. The entire memorial, more an act of town planning than funerary monument, was designed by Sir Aston Webb. It takes the form of a processional route from Trafalgar Square to Buckingham Palace. Beginning at Admiralty Arch, the project takes in The Mall and culminates in a \\"rond point\\" before the palace, with Sir Thomas Brock's Victoria Memorial at its centre.Edwardian London provides some general contemporary information on the memorial scheme. The Canada Gate was commissioned, in 1905, along with the gates for Buckingham Palace and two other similar, but smaller gates presented by Australia and South Africa. The commission was won by the Bromsgrove Guild (a company of modern artists and designers associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement) who completed the work and had the gate in situ by 1911.WorcestershireThe Times, Thursday, May 11, 1911; pg. 10; Issue 39582 mentions the gate in its report of the unveiling of the Victoria Memorial statue Avenue leading to the Canada Gate and Victoria memorial. The Canada Memorial is within the park, just to the right of the gate and in sight of the palace which is to the right of the memorial. The gate stands to the north side of the \\"rond point\\" at the junction with Constitution Hill; today, a congested roundabout, but occasionally closed to traffic when the Mall is required for state processions from the palace. From the gate, a long double avenue stretches the width of the park through to Piccadilly. The gate is in the same style as those of Buckingham Palace and bears the emblems of the seven Canadian provinces of the time. In design, Canada Gate takes the form of a screen consisting of 5 portals of gilded wrought iron, the central section being the principal and largest gate; the double gates are supported on columns of iron. The two wrought iron bays flanking the central gate contain smaller gates, while the two terminating bays contain smaller pedestrian gates. The screen is terminated by two massive pillars of Portland stone surmounted by patriotic statuary. The flanking inner columns are smaller and, like the iron posts, are crowned by gas lanterns of similar design to those on the pillars of the palace railings.

Early years Born in a mountain village in the Black Sea Region of Turkey, the daughter of a Laz family, Mircan's life is the primary source of her music. In her early childhood years she went through a period where she listened so intensely that her family thought she could not speak. Ever since, Mircan has preferred sitting in silence so she can call to mind the sounds of nature. She started singing very early, in infancy, when she would rather sing adult songs than those for babies and children. Singing with orchestras in wedding ceremonies became an activity for her. She got her first guitar when she was 12 years old. While attending the university for her engineering degree, she was singing at the classical Turkish music chorus of the university, doing traditional folk dance, aesthetic gymnastics as well as writing & composing songs and singing with her rock band. She made her first overseas journey during these years ‚Äì to Jordan, where she went on a scholarship given by the university. There she saw Petra, the mysterious desert atmosphere and the Dead Sea. The tunes she improvised along the path to Petra were to pave future roads for her. Career Music Mircan Kaya, who lives now for the most part in Turkey and Italy has become increasingly well known in recent years for her distinctive music; but she brings to the Turkish cultural scene much more than her music.[1][2] After the release of her first two albums \\"Bizim Ninniler (Our Lullabies)\\" and \\"K√ºl (Ashes)\\", in 2006, she expanded the operational scope of her engineering company in advanced engineering and earthquake technologies and founded UCM (UnCatalogued Music Production).She released three more albums in two years time. Sala, Numinosum and Outim. Numinosum is a musical journey based on the concept of \\"numinous conscious\\" used by Carl Gustav Jung. She combined her own lyrics with the poetry of Rumi. This album was recorded in Bristol, UK, with the post jazz group Limbo. Roger Mills and Osman Kent worked on the final edition, mixing, mastering and sound engineering of the album. Before she set off for her advanced master study at the University of Padua and the Technical University of Catalonia, she released her most avant-garde music project OUTIM ‚Äì Once Upon a Time in Mingrelia, a work combining journeys to Georgia and Eastern Black Sea of Turkey, writing a book, constructing a house with local materials and carpenters, recording a music album using her own lyrics as well as the words of the Mingrelian poet Xhelimishi Xasani.This album was also recorded with Limbo in Bristol, UK. Mircan's third album \\"Sala\\" was reviewed by FROOTS magazine and described as a Pre-Raphaelite tapestry, a genius work full of juxtapositions. In 2010, she was awarded the best film music award at 47th Antalya International Golden Orange Film Festival with the music she has produced for the film \\"Kar Beyaz/White as Snow\\" directed by Selim Gunes. The film music was produced in collaboration with musicians in Turkey, Australia and England. The music contains songs from her albums \\"Sala\\", \\"Outim\\",\\"Numinosum\\", \\"Kul & Ashes\\" as well as two new songs she composed with the work of great living women poet of Turkey, Gulten Akin. On her album \\"Elixir\\" which was released in 2010 she composed the poems of G√ºlten Akƒ±n. The album was in the \\"Best of 2010\\" by the world music program \\"Crossing Continents\\" of California KDVS Radio, a program produced by Gil Medovoy. In January 2012 Mircan Kaia was awarded the Best Film Music Award at the 44th SIYAD Cinema Awards. In March 2012, Mircan Kaia recorded the first contemporary lullaby album in Laz ‚Äì Mingrelian language in London with British musicians. The album Nanni contains ten original lullabies in Laz ‚Äì Mingrelian language and one lullaby in Abhaz language. In the same year she also released her album Minor on which she rendered the folk songs of minority people of Turkey as well as her own compositions. The album has been reviewed and praised by World Music Central. In 2014, Mircan Kaia scored the music of short film The Chocolate Wrapper directed by Murat Kebir in London. The Film was awarded the Best Foreign Film at the International Family Film Festival in the US. In 2014, Mircan Kaia's first book \\"Gece Karanlƒ±k Cekirge ve Sen / Night Darkness Grasshopper and You\\" was published. Her album Insula which was released in 2018 has been charted by the Trans Global World Music Chart In the same year she has released the album Hush covering world lullabies in different languages. \\"Kƒ±rmƒ±zƒ± G√ºl (Red Rose)\\" and \\"Tatlƒ± Dilli / Sweet Talker\\" have followed the album Hush.

It was enlarged in 1893 by Deacons who used the water to supply Belmont Bleachworks. It holds 150,000 cubic metres of water, with a surface area of 28,000 square metres, when full.

It had fallen into a state of disrepair following the closure of the bleachworks, and was considered a flood risk by the Environment Agency. By the end of August 2010 heavy rain had refilled the reservoir, and in September 2010 it was sold for ¬£50,000.

PSC regulates telecommunications, transportation, electric and natural gas services in the U.S. state of Georgia. Commissioners are elected in partisan elections statewide, though they must reside in a district. The PSC is charged with protecting the public interest and promoting a healthy business- investment economy. The PSC is responsible for varying degrees of regulation in State telecommunications, gas, and electric companies and for establishing and enforcing the standards for quality of service.  History  The regulatory functions of the PSC have changed dramatically since its founding. On October 14, 1879, Georgia became one of the first states to establish a regulatory agency to oversee railroad expansion and competition. Known as the Railroad Commission of Georgia, the commission consisted of three members who were appointed by the governor and served staggered six-year terms. In 1891 telegraph and express companies came under the commission's jurisdiction. By 1907 the commission began to regulate docks and wharves, as well as telephone, gas, and electric-power companies, and in 1931 its jurisdiction expanded to cover the trucking industry. In 1922 the Georgia legislature changed the agency's name to the Georgia Public Service Commission to reflect its expanded regulatory role.  PSC operations  In 1907 the number of commissioners elected statewide was increased from three to five. Today the five elected commissioners are supported by approximately ninety staff members, and, usually, every two years, the Chair is selected by the commission members. Beginning with the 2000 election year, each seat on the commission is assigned to one of five districts. Candidates for the commission must reside in the district with the available commission seat, although the entire state continues to vote for all five slots. Commissioners serve staggered six-year terms. The commission depends primarily on appropriations from the Georgia General Assembly. In fiscal year 1999 the total budget of the PSC amounted to approximately $14 million, with approximately $9.5 million coming from the Georgia legislature and the remaining $4.4 million from the federal government and other funds. The fiscal year 2004 budget was $9.3 million. When regulated utility companies bring a rate request before the PSC, the request is first addressed by one of the commission's four standing committees: telecommunications, energy, transportation, or policy development and intergovernmental affairs. The commissioners are assisted by experts on utility and transportation operations, who may provide testimony and make recommendations regarding rates or arbitration. The PSC makes decisions by a majority vote of the commissioners. It is authorized only to issue administrative orders. Furthermore, its rulings must be consistent with current legal standards and are subject to judicial review by the courts.  Regulatory functions of the PSC  Although the PSC over the years has regulated the rates and service of the telecommunications, gas, and electric industries, today it does not regulate all utility companies within these sectors. The commission regulates only the rates charged and the services provided by most intrastate, investor-owned telecommunications, gas, and electric utilities operating in Georgia. The commission does not set rates for municipally owned electric and gas utilities or electric membership corporations, although these utilities consult the commission on such matters as financing and the resolution of territorial disputes. The commission also ensures the safety of all natural-gas pipelines in the state. The commission plays a smaller role with regard to the transportation sector. Its authority over truck and express companies and private and for-hire motor carriers is restricted to requiring proof of insurance and safety inspections.  Deregulation  The deregulation of the telecommunications and natural gas industries in the 1990s greatly altered the regulatory functions of the PSC. Instead of regulating the rates of telephone and gas services, the commission plays a strong role as a manager and facilitator of open-market competition.  Telecommunications  Georgia's Telecommunication and Competition Development Act of 1995 and the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 have greatly affected the telecommunications industry in Georgia. Both statutes sought to turn the traditional regulated monopoly service into a competitive market. Thus the commission no longer sets rates for telephone services but establishes and administers a universal access fund, which ensures reasonable access to services for customers; monitors rates and service quality; and mediates disputes between competitors. By the end of 2003 the number of certificated local competitive telephone exchange providers had grown to 221.  Natural gas  More than 1.8 million Georgia customers use natural gas. In early 1997 Georgia became the first state to adopt legislation to deregulate natural gas with the Natural Gas Competition and Deregulation Act. The commission's role under the Natural Gas Act is similar to the one it plays in the telecommunications market: to facilitate the transition from a regulated monopoly to a competitive marketplace. As part of the deregulation process, the Atlanta Gas Light Company, which had long held a monopoly in the market, withdrew from selling natural gas to become a distributor of natural gas in 1999. Unregulated marketing companies now sell natural gas at variable prices, much in the way that long-distance telephone companies operate. By all accounts Georgia's transition from monopoly to market competition has been very contentious. Several problems have plagued the deregulation process from the beginning, and unusually high gas prices have recently exacerbated the situation. As facilitator of the deregulation process, the PSC has played a high-profile role in several disputes. First, early in the deregulation process, the PSC settled several \\"slamming\\" cases with marketers. Slamming occurs when companies switch customers without their authorization. Second, after several marketers persistently billed customers incorrectly, the PSC resolved the billing disputes. Third, in November 2000 several marketers threatened to shut off service for nonpayment of bills. The PSC voted unanimously to impose an immediate moratorium through April 1, 2001, on shutoffs of gas service for residential customers. In January 2001, in a three-to-two vote, the PSC overrode protests from natural-gas marketers and enacted emergency rules to allow consumers who owe money in back bills to switch to marketers with lower prices.

History The American Railroad Co. of Puerto Rico began construction of the tunnel around 1904 during the expansion of the northern line towards the west of the island. The tunnel connected the towns of Quebradillas and Isabela on the Guajataca River canyon. The construction was completed with the excavation of two tunnels on each side of the canyon. They were joined by a steel viaduct long at an elevation of above the river level. The tunnel is open to the public but it is fairly isolated. The tunnel leads to \\"Guajataca beach\\" known for its white sand, raging surf, and dangerous turbulent waters. Concerts are sometimes held at the Guajataca Tunnel.

As a young man in the Drumchapel side he was picked out - along with T. Inglis, C. L. Vermont and C. H. Stewart. - as starring in a match at Thirdpart against Hillhead HSFP 2XV. The football club Glasgow Rangers were interested in signing the young man. This did not please his rugby loving father who instead sorted a move to Uddingston RFC for the player. Stuart was later to move to Clydesdale and then London Scottish. He also played for West of Scotland. Provincial career Stuart played for Glasgow District in the inter-city match against Edinburgh District. International career He was capped seven times for between 1909‚Äì11. Cricket career He played cricket for Poloc. He was Poloc's first century maker and played cricket well into the 1920s.https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001876/19040701/057/0003https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001738/19040618/051/0007 Engineering career Stuart got a job as an Engineer with Rowans Engineering working in the oil industry. This was to curtail his international career. At the age of 23 he moved to Burma with Rowans. While at Rowans he organised a rugby side, Rowans Engineers RFC; run as an invitational side. The basis of the side were players from Uddingston, Clydesdale and West of Scotland. Stuart never forgot his first club Drumchapel - and for many years he took his invitational side back there; and the Drumchapel - Rowan Engineers match became the traditional preseason opening fixture for the Thirdpart side. Journalism career Later in life Stuart followed in the footsteps of his father and became a sports journalist writing for the Glasgow Herald; concentrating on rugby union and cricket matches. Family His father Charles Douglas Stuart Senior played for Royal HSFP; a forward of the famous Nat Watt's Lambs side.https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000452/19330106/415/0013 Senior was also a journalist for the Glasgow Herald.

Sanders contacts Petra to tell her the relay link's down ‚Äì they can't contact Madrid. Either they were shut off in Madrid, or the local relays have been sabotaged. Suddenly, Campbell is grabbed by the troll. The Doctor manages to grab it, and recognises its face ‚Äì it's Karl Baring. They struggle, the Doctor is knocked down, and the troll attacks. Part Two Petra fights the troll off with a branch, releasing the Doctor. He tries to grab the creature with a parka, but underfoot, the ground forms tentacles which attempt to drag them under. Petra helps the Doctor trap the troll with her own coat, and the limbs disintegrate. Bryant's lackey Stephenson sedates Katy, ready to be taken to the bridge. Two troopers bring Tim Hill into the room Sanders intends to walk to the coast, taking an emergency flare. Petra stands up to Bryant, telling him not to take Katy. He orders Chavez to shoot her. After a face-off, Petra stands down, and Bryant tells Chavez to put his gun away. The Doctor realises that the Spheriosis is under the house ‚Äì it's enormous. Above, he hears the helicopter being boarded. Nonetheless, the helicopter reaches the scorched riverbank. Explosives have damaged the soil, but the bridge is still intact. They leave the helicopter, and spot a flare in the distance ‚Äì Sanders, proving that the Spheriosis reaches far away. In the cellar, the Doctor hears the Spheriosis under the ground again. He jumps for the stairs, and a trunk of roots breaks through the ground into the cellar. The Doctor calls for help, attracting the trunk's attention. It shoots at the Doctor, just as the door is unlocked. The Doctor escapes, and the door is closed by Vanessa. A creature breaks through the ground ‚Äì the troll. Behind them, Bryant takes the car and drives away. Around them, more arms break through the ground ‚Äì more trolls. The Doctor guesses the way to keep Karl fighting is to put Katy in maximum danger ‚Äì to take her under the bridge. Bryant speeds away, avoiding the creatures. He drives for the bank, but crashes, activating the airbag and stalling the engine. A troll attacks the car as Bryant tries to get it going again ‚Äì and then a second troll, followed by a whole pack of them. The Doctor hauls the troll under the bridge, and throws it at Katy. She recognises Karl as he sighs, and the entire creature disintegrates ‚Äì including the tentacles outside. The Doctor digs his way out of the ground, pulling Katy back after him. She tells her Karl managed to kill the creature. Outside references The Tenth Doctor encounters a creature acting very much like a troll under the bridge. Critical reception Doctor Who Magazine reviewer Vanessa Bishop criticised the resemblance to a \\"classic Tom Baker story\\", but praised David Tennant's reading of the story.

He was fired from his position on 11 October 2009 by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono after being convicted of murder. He was granted clemency in early 2017 by President Joko Widodo and released from prison.  Family  Antasari Azhar is the fourth of 15 children born to Azhar Hamid and Asnani. His father was the head of a tax office in Belitung.  Education  Antasari grew up on Belitung Island. After finishing his elementary school education in 1965, he attended junior and senior high school in Jakarta, graduating in 1971. He then studied at Sriwijaya University, majoring in state management and graduated in 1981. At university, Antasari was the Senate Chairman and Head of the Student Community. He was involved in a demonstration in 1978. Later, as a state prosecutor, he took several courses including Commercial Law at New South Wales University in Sydney, and Environmental Law Investigation at the Environment Protection Authority in Melbourne.  Career  Antasari started his career at the Justice Ministry (1981‚Äì1985). His plan to become a diplomat changed after he was accepted to become a prosecutor at the Central Jakarta State Prosecutor's Office, where he served from 1985 to 1989. Next he was appointed as a prosecutor at Tanjung Pinang State Prosecutor's Office (1989‚Äì1992). He then served as Head of the Corruption Investigation Section at the Lampung High State Prosecutor's Office (1992‚Äì1994) and later as Head of Special Crimes at the West Jakarta State Prosecutor's Office (1994‚Äì1996). Next, he became Baturaja State Prosecutor (1997‚Äì1999). In 1999, Antasari joined the High State Prosecutor's Office, serving as chief investigator of the Special Crimes Sub-directorate (1999‚Äì2000). He was subsequently Head of Mass Media Communication (2000) at the High State Prosecutor's Office. It was as Chief of the South Jakarta State Prosecutor's Office (2000‚Äì2007) that he first gained widespread attention in the mass media. In 2000, the Supreme Court sentenced former president Suharto's youngest son Tommy to 18 months in jail for corruption. It was Antasari's job to take Tommy to jail, but instead the former playboy was allowed to go on the run, resulting in speculation that Antasari had been paid off, although this was never proved.  Chairman of Corruption Eradication Commission  The controversy over Tommy Suharto's case did not stop Antasari from being elected Chairman of the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) in December 2007, defeating Chandra M. Hamzah by 41 votes in the election held by the 49 members of the Indonesian House of Representatives' (DPR) Commission III on legal affairs. His election victory was attributed to strong lobbying by Golkar Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP).  Murder case  On 4 May 2009, Antasari was arrested on suspicion of ordering the murder of Nasrudin Zulkarnaen, a prominent businessman who headed a state-owned pharmaceuticals firm, PT Rajawali Putra Banjaran. It was alleged that Nasrudin had been blackmailing Antasari over the latter's extramarital affair with a female golf caddy. Also arrested in connection with the murder were tycoon Sigid Haryo Wibisono, the former head of Golkar's Central Java chapter and chief commissioner of the Harian Merdeka newspaper; and Senior Commissioner Wiliardi Wizar, the former South Jakarta Police chief. Six men involved in planning and conducting the assassination was also detained. Williardi was accused of hiring the hit squad and Sigid was accused of paying for the hit. Antasari denied any wrongdoing, claiming he was faithful to his wife, Ida Laksmiwati, of 26 years. He was suspended as KPK chairman by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. On 11 February 2010, Antasari was convicted of ordering the murder and sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment. He appealed the verdict unsuccessfully.  Clemency  Antasari was granted clemency on 26 January 2017 by President Joko Widodo. He claims that the murder case was manipulated by President Yudhoyono for political reasons.  Advice  Antasari's advice to his daughter at the time of her marriage was: \\"Treasure is not valuable in the world, but the prayers and alms are the best in the world.\\"  References   External links  * Antasari Azhar Site * Antasari Azhar Profile * Profil singkat di kapanlagi.com Category:Living people Category:1953 births Category:Indonesian politicians Category:Indonesian people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Indonesia Category:Politicians convicted of murder Category:Indonesian people of Malay descent Category:Indonesian politicians convicted of crimes ","title":"Antasari Azhar"},{"id":"26160488","text":"Mayfair Verm√∂gensverwaltung SE is the family office of the families of G√ºnter Herz and Daniela Herz. It invests in long term holdings of companies, short term assets like stocks and bonds, and real estate. The long term investment area is run by Maryland GmbH. According to German press quotes, investments range from ‚Ç¨ 100m to several billion per transaction and have an emphasis on companies from the consumer goods, retail or service sectors. History of the families The families had been long term shareholders of Tchibo Group. G√ºnter Herz took over the leadership of the group from his father in 1965. Since then Tchibo expanded from some DM 50m turnover to almost ‚Ç¨9.5bn on a pro forma consolidated basis. Tchibo Frischr√∂st GmbH, the original coffee business innovated a non-food concept with weekly changing assortments that it introduced in its 1300 store retail chain. It also expanded through an innovative concession depot concept to some 25,000 point of sale in Germany, Austria and Switzerland growing its total business to some ‚Ç¨3.9bn turnover in 2003. In 1997 Tchibo acquired its key competitor Eduscho, integrated the logistics and retail operations and included the Eduscho coffee brand in its coffee portfolio. In 1977 Tchibo bought a 25% stake in publicly listed Beiersdorf AG. At the time Beiersdorf achieved a turnover of some ‚Ç¨ 400m from its Nivea, Tesa and Hansaplast brands. During the 80s Nivea was repositioned from a cream brand to a personal care brand and started on a global expansion. 25 years later Nivea has become the largest personal care brand globally and Beiersdorf has grown to almost ‚Ç¨ 5bn in sales. Finally in 1980 the group acquired a stake in the European cigarette company Reemtsma. That stake was increased over the years to a 76% holding and Reemtsma turnover grew from ‚Ç¨1.5bn in 1980 to ‚Ç¨8.5bn in 2002. 21 years after the first investment, Tchibo decided to sell its stake to Imperial Tobacco. In 2002 G√ºnter Herz stepped down as CEO of the group following a shift in the supervisory board of the group. About a year later G√ºnter and Daniela decided to sell their stakes in Tchibo Group to their siblings and set up Mayfair as a new family holding. Investments Mayfair has so far undertaken two investments. The first was the acquisition of a stake in publicly listed Puma AG in May 2005. Following the announcement of a new strategic phase by Puma's CEO Jochen Zeitz, which involved the repurchase of licensed countries and the roll out of a retail network, Mayfair increased their stake from 17% to 27%. Two years later, when the luxury group PPR made a public offer for Puma in 2007, Mayfair decided to sell their stake in the company for 330 euros per share. The second investment was the ‚Ç¨575 m acquisition of German certification group Germanischer Lloyd AG. G√ºnter Herz supported the management team in an effort to fend off a hostile bid from rival Bureau Veritas. Since the acquisition, GL has broadened its scope from shipping to oil & gas and renewable energy through a number of acquisitions. From 2006 until September 2013, when GL merged with DNV (Det Norske Veritas) to become DNV GL, Mayfair was the only shareholder of GL. The DNV Foundation now owns 63.5% of DNV GL, while Mayfair owns the remaining 36.5%. In December 2017, Mayfair sold their remaining stake back to the Det Norske Veritas Foundation.

The play begins with Novachek on the telephone lamenting the inadequacies of the actresses who have showed up that day to audition for the lead character, Vanda von Dunayev.Broadway review by Marilyn Stasio, Variety, 9 February 2012The character is named \\"Wanda von Dunajew\\" in the novel. Suddenly, at the last minute, a new actress called Vanda (Wanda) Jordan bursts in. At first it's hard to imagine that she will please this very particular and exasperated writer/director: She's brash, vulgar and unschooled. But she convinces him to let her audition for the part of Vanda von Dunayev, with the director/writer reading the part of Severin von Kushemski.The character is named \\"Severin von Kusiemski\\" in the novel. Much happens during this dynamic reading, as lightning flashes and thunder crashes outside. Vanda shows astonishing insights into the novel and her character, and she performs what is in effect a terrific audition. They both become caught up in the characters they are reading. The balance of power is reversed, and the actress establishes dominance over the director, which is similar to what occurs in the novel.Ives, David. Venus in Fur. Northwestern University Press. 2011.

Starring Dileep, Sathyaraj, Charmy Kaur and Lal. The music for the film was provided by Ouseppachan. In the plot, a mysterious man Gautham arrives at retired Army General Hareendranath Varma's house, but his arrival has a backstory. Plot The film begins with the song \\"Manju Mazha\\" showing the family of young Gautham Menon moving into Srinagar and their getting used to the Kashmir life. Later a group of terrorists besiege the village and kill Gautham's parents. Gautham's older sister pulls him away from the killers and hides behind woods. A terrorist finds them and a gunshot is heard. Later his sister is seen to be in the Hospital in critical stage and the Doctor asks him to pray for her. The song continues and Gautham is shown growing to a teenager and winning accolades from school. He runs to the hospital to share the joy with his still hospitalized sister, but sees her dying in the hospital bed. The story turns to the present where an adult Gautham Menon (Dileep) goes to see the old doctor uncle, Dr. Unnithan (Babu Namboothiri) who was a friend of his late father and his mentor during his childhood. Gautham says his company posted him to India and he can choose his posting between Chennai and Bangalore. Aagathan song shooting at Shivanasamudra Falls He goes to see an old Army officer, Major George Joseph (Retd) (Lal), who was discharged from his duties for having squabbles with superiors while drunk. He tells Gautham that he had his family killed in an accident resulted from his drunk driving. Gautham reveals himself to Major as the kid from the past who was compassionately consoled by him after the military operation that killed the terrorists that attacked Gautham's village. Meanwhile, a journalist comes to visit General Hareendranath Varma (Retd) (Sathyaraj) to publish his biography. The General reluctantly accepts the offer. Later he sees his mother trying to call Shreya, daughter of Varma, asking her to stop by while en route to Bangalore, that they could proceed her marriage with an NRI boy. Knowing the intentions of Grandma, Shreya (Charmy Kaur) dodges the calls saying she can hardly hear her while travelling on the bus. The bus hits an old woman. Gautham, sitting next to Shreya, carries the women to bus demanding to take her to hospital. He asks the help of Shreya to carry her to the hospital. The driver takes the bus leaving behind Gautham and Shreya at the hospital. Later the relatives of the victim come to hospital and takes money from Gautham as compensation. Gautham and Shreya leave and have to wait till 10 PM to catch the next Bus to Bangalore, where Shreya has to pay all the expenses. Shreya finds Gautham gone in the morning, but after repaying her the expenses and a note left behind. She is picked up by her cousin and cousin's husband Dr. Sudhir Krishna (Biju Menon). Incidentally Gautham also rents the house owned by Sudhir's brother and befriends his family, though he tactfully dodges Shreya every time she sees him. Shreya develops a fondness towards Gautham, despite not knowing anything about him including his name. Meanwhile, her Grandma arrives to Bangalore and Sudhir comes up with the proposal of Gautham for Shreya. Grandma likes Gautham upon seeing him. But Shreya, already in love with ‚Äòstranger‚Äô, does not agree to it. Later ‚Äòstranger‚Äô reveals himself to Shreya as Gautham. Varma invites Gautham to his farmhouse to meet him. Gautham wins everybody's heart with his polite and gentle manner. Later he beats the General in a chess game and gains his admiration. That moment Gautham reveals himself as a survivor of the terrorist attack foiled by Varma's army which upsets the general. Gautham speaks to the General in Private and reveals the truth that his sister was cruelly raped by the then commanding officer Varma after killing all the terrorists knocking her unconscious for the rest of her life. Varma asks Major George, who was a silent witness to his cruelty, to report it as a terrorist act thereby hiding the truth. Gautham swears to the General that he will make him reveal the truth to everyone. Aagathan song shooting at Shivanasamudra Falls Gautham gets close to everyone in the family which annoys Varma who tries everything to get rid of him. Gautham proves to Varma that Shreya is madly in love with him. Varma takes Gautham out for a ride and threatens to kill him by pointing a gun, but Gautham has already texted Shreya to follow them, thereby foiling Varma's attempt. Later Varma almost succeed in killing Gautham by locking him in the wine preserving barrel, but Gautham escapes with the help of Lawrence (Innocent), Varma's servant. He challenges Varma that he will make him reveal the secret in two days, that is at the engagement ceremony. A large party of the General's ex- colleagues, including Major George, is invited to the function by Gautham using Varma's email id. It is also revealed that the journalist chronicling Varma's biography has also been sent by Gautham to trap him. The media people are also invited. All these were done so that when the secret is revealed, all will come to know easily. At the function, Varma presents himself in the Army General's uniform. He reveals the secret to all the invited guests in the guise of a dirty plan by Gautham to blackmail him. Varma also says that if anyone among the guests believes the story, he will shoot himself. But all keep quiet. Gautham challenges General to shoot him if the story is a scam. Though the General points the gun towards Gautham, he cannot pull himself to shoot him, thereby silently admitting the crime. Soon all the guests turn against him. Realizing his mistake and out of guilt, he leaves the scene and kills himself after writing down the confession to the President of India and returning all the accolades and awards he received during his service. The film ends with Shreya sitting in an airport receiving a letter passed on to her. She reads it to find it from Gautham asking if she still has feelings for him.

The Public Warning System is a network of civil defense sirens installed by the Singapore Civil Defence Force on over 2,000 strategic points in Singapore to warn Singaporeans of impending dangers, air raids and atomic bomb blasts. Thus far, the siren network has only been used for occasional public awareness drills, monthly noon chimes and for commemorating the island's Total Defence (February 15) and Civil Defence Days (September 15). It was also used to mark a minute's silence nationwide for the passing of former Prime minister Lee Kuan Yew on the evening of 23 March 2015 and on August 1st and 9th, 2020 to mark the first National Day at home. History When it was a British colony, Singapore had mechanically-powered air raid sirens over the island, but the system did not work perfectly and was defunct after World War II. Then, in the 1980s, the SCDF planned a network of powerful electrical sirens throughout Singapore to warn the people of natural disasters and air raids. The first 250 of these sirens were completed by H√∂rmann Warnsysteme GmbH in 1991 and tested in 1992 on certain parts of Singapore, and by now 284 sirens are installed on rooftops of selected buildings or on the ground if there are no buildings. Types There are a total of four installation types, they can be installed with: Standard: Eight horns joined together on the left and right sides of a thin medium length steel pole (for buildings with short, medium or no rooftops). This is the original design from 1992 still used today. Also built as on ground sirens on certain areas of Singapore: Yew Tee Industrial Estate, Sungei Kadut, Adam Road Mid-Sub Power Station, Mandai Air Base, an unknown factory in northern Woodlands and on the compounds of Woodlands Fire Station. This configuration is based on the ECN 1200. Half-size: Four horns joined together on the left right sides of a thin medium length steel pole (for buildings with medium-high rooftops) or a long steel pole (for buildings with high rooftops). First completed in mid-1990s. This configuration is based on the ECN 600. Double: Double the horns, but not double the decibels of the signals with sixteen horns as standard type and eight horns for half-size. First completed in late 1990s and installed in early to mid-2000s. This configuration is based on the ECN 2400. Also built as an on ground siren (standard sixteen horn type) on the Assumption English School compound few meters away from the school until it was rebuilt from late 2015 until early 2016 with the siren's current whereabouts unknown. \\"Zig-Zag\\": Four horns joined together in a \\"zig zag\\" pattern on both left right sides of a thin short steel pole, this is the default configuration of the ECN 600 completed in 2009 it is currently on the rooftop of Clementi Fire Station. Sirens attached on appropriate rooftops of buildings can have a custom-made line control unit cabinet (which is white) beside the siren, and to the lower section of on-ground sirens, to eliminate remote control of them from the nearby fire stations turning them into sourcing sirens. Signals There are a total of four signals sounded by the sirens, they are: Alarm signal: Wailing blasts that warn people of a danger or threat and it means for them to move a SCDF air raid shelter. Used only once on the island's Total Defence Day in 2006. (Sounds similar to the 'Attack' signal in the US) All clear signal: Continuous blasts of a clear sound to allow the people to move out of the shelter if the threat is over. (Sounds similar to the US' Alert signal) Important Message signal: Pulsating blasts sounded to alert the people of important messages broadcast by Singapore FM radio stations. This is the most used signal as to celebrate Total Defence and Civil Defence Days in Singapore, sounded at 12:05pm on these days. However, from Total Defence Day 2015 and 15 September 2018 onwards, this signal was sounded at 6:20 pm instead of 12:05pm in remembrance of the British's surrender of Singapore in World War II on 15 February 1942 at 6:20 pm. Testing signal: The test signal is a chime sounded on the 1st day of every month on 12:00PM (GMT+8:00 SGT). Since 2009 this chime has also been used on National Day on August 9 (and since 2011, on the preview show whose date differs every year) to signal the Pledge Moment when Singaporeans recite the Singapore Pledge and sing the National Anthem. In 2009 it was held at 8:22 pm and for 2010 and 2011 it was held at 8:10 pm. 2010's version was known as One Voice 2010 and the time at which it was held (8:10pm) was read as 2010 hrs in the 24-hour clock, coinciding with the year 2010. In 2011 and 2012 it was simply known as the Pledge Moment, and 2012's version was held at about 8pm instead of 8:10pm in previous years. 2020's was on 10:33am & 8:20pm. Usage in other countries In 2009, Sircom AG of Germany has thought of using H√∂rmann's Public Warning System's siren made for the SCDF as a base to make their own sirens, with their default configuration having its horns attached to front and rear of the pole.

Early history First formation Z Battery was originally raised in Poona, India on 1 April 1824 as 4th Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery, part of the Bombay Presidency Army of the Honourable East India Company. As a result of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company on 1 November 1858 under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858. The Presidency armies transferred to the direct authority of the British Crown and its European units were transferred to the British Army. Henceforth artillery, the mutineers most effective arm, was to be the sole preserve of the British Army (with the exception of certain Mountain Artillery batteries). On 19 February 1862, the Bombay Horse Artillery transferred to the Royal Horse Artillery as its 4th Brigade and 4th Troop became D Battery, 4th Horse Brigade, RA. A reorganization of the horse artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 1st Brigade split as A and B Brigades, 2nd Brigade became C Brigade, 3rd Brigade became D Brigade, 4th Brigade became E Brigade, and 5th Brigade became F Brigade. As battery designations were tied to the brigade the battery was assigned to, the battery was now designated D Battery, E Brigade, the first of a bewildering series of redesignations. From 1866, the term \\"Royal Horse Artillery\\" appeared in Army List hence the battery was designated D Battery, E Brigade, RHA from about this time. Throughout this period, the battery was based at Ahmednager. On 1 February 1871 it was designated H Battery, C Brigade, became H Battery, D Brigade on 16 January 1873 and E Battery, E Brigade on 1 April 1875. Another reorganization on 1 July 1877 saw E Brigade disbanded with its batteries distributed amongst A, B and C Brigades. The battery was now redesignated E Battery, C Brigade at Aldershot. By January 1882, the battery was at Kirkee. On 1 April 1882, C Brigade was in its turn disbanded with its batteries distributed amongst A and B Brigades. The battery was now redesignated N Battery, A Brigade at Canterbury. The battery took partas N/A Battery in the Anglo-Egyptian War, notably the Battle of Tel el-Kebir in September 1882. The battery was disbanded in February 1884. The brigade system was abolished on 1 July 1889. From now on, RHA batteries would be designated in a single sequence. Reformed Z Battery, RHA was reformed on 13 February 1900. The Brigade system was revived on 1 March 1901 and the battery was assigned to the 4th Brigade-Division, RHA on formation (along with AA Battery, RHA). In 1903, the brigade was redesignated IV Brigade, RHA and was stationed at Newbridge in Ireland. On 1 October 1906, the brigade was redesignated XIV Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery and was broken up on 1 August 1913. The battery was transferred to II Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery at Canterbury and was disbanded again on 24 December 1913. World War I (Tempy) Z Battery As a result of the Action at N√©ry on 1 September 1914, L Battery, RHA was almost destroyed as an operational unit: of five Officers, three were killed and two wounded; of 200 Other Ranks, 20 were killed and 29 wounded; and five of six 13 pounders were lost. It had to be withdrawn to England to reform. (Tempy) Z Battery, RHA was formed on 1 September from the Centre and Left Sections of I Battery, RHA to replace L Battery in VII Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery, 1st Cavalry Division. On 3 September, the Left Section of I Battery was replaced by a Section of D Battery, RHA. On 15 September, this section returned to D Battery and on 17 September a section of J Battery, RHA joined. On 27 September, the sections of I and J returned to their batteries and (Tempy) Z Battery ceased to exist. The next day, H Battery, RHA joined 1st Cavalry Division in its place. During the battery's brief existence, 1st Cavalry Division saw action in the First Battle of the Marne and the First Battle of the Aisne. Z Battery Z Battery, RHA was reformed on 9 October 1914 equipped with six 13 pounders. It joined the Ipswich based G Battery and O Battery in V Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery. V Brigade, RHA was assigned to 8th Division on formation in October 1914. With 8th Division, it crossed to France on 4 and 5 November 1914 and served with the division on the Western Front until January 1917. While with the division, it served in the battles of Neuve Chapelle, Aubers Ridge, and of the Somme. On 8 June 1915, the battery was re-armed with six 18 pounders. On 13 January 1917, V Brigade, RHA left 8th Division and became V Army Brigade, RHA. At the Armistice, it was serving as Army Troops with the Fourth Army. By October 1919, the battery had joined the newly reformed VIII Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery. On 4 January 1920, the battery was absorbed into B Battery, RHA. Recent operations Z Battery deployed on Operation Herrick 13 and 18 in Afghanistan.

The Pyrenees: subduction and collision? Earth Planet. Soc. Lett. 35:151‚Äì160. The belt has an extended, polycyclic geological evolution dating back to the Precambrian. The chain's present configuration is due to the collision between the microcontinent Iberia and the southwestern promontory of the European Plate (i.e. Southern France). The two continents were approaching each other since the onset of the Upper Cretaceous (Albian/Cenomanian) about 100 million years ago and were consequently colliding during the Paleogene (Eocene/Oligocene) 55 to 25 million years ago. After its uplift, the chain experienced intense erosion and isostatic readjustments. A cross-section through the chain shows an asymmetric flower-like structure with steeper dips on the French side. The Pyrenees are not solely the result of compressional forces, but also show an important sinistral shearing.  Geographic arrangement  The Pyrenees sensu stricto stretch in a west-northwest-east-southeast-direction (N 110) over 430 km from the Bay of Biscay in the west to the Golfe du Lion and the Golf de Roses in the east, their width across strike varying between 65 and 150 km. They are bounded in the north by the North Pyrenean Front (French: Front nord- pyr√©n√©en, also North Pyrenean frontal fault or NPFF), a major thrust fault along which units from the North Pyrenean Zone have been transported over the Subpyrenean Zone, southernmost part of the Aquitaine Basin, their northern foreland. Their southern limit is the South Pyrenean Frontal Fault. Here, thrust slices from the Sierras Marginales and their lateral equivalents are displaced southward over the Ebro Basin. Yet in a larger, geologically more meaningful sense the Pyrenees continue farther west into the Basque and the Cantabrian mountains (the Basque-Cantabrian chain). They finally disappear along the continental margin of Asturias. Likewise in the east, they do not just vanish in the Mediterranean but rather pursue their course via the nappe units of the Corbi√®res Massif into Bas Languedoc and even into southern Provence. At their far eastern end in Provence, typical Pyrenean fold trends are superimposed by Alpine structures to be finally cut off by the arc of the Western Alps. The Pyrenean chain in the larger sense is nearly 1000 km long.  Structural organisation of the orogen  A profile through the Pyrenees sensu stricto shows a fan-like, flower-like arrangement. The structure is strongly asymmetric with a steeper and narrower French northern side and a much wider and more gently inclined Spanish southern side. The double-sided orogen can be divided into several tectonic zones, from north to south, that are bounded by east‚Äìwest-trending major faults:Choukroune, P (1992). Tectonic evolution of the Pyrenees. Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci. 20:143‚Äì158 * Northern foreland ‚Äî Aquitaine Basin * Subpyrenean Zone or Subpyrenean Basin * North Pyrenean Zone * Axial Zone * South Pyrenean Zone * Sierras Marginales * Southern foreland ‚Äî Ebro Basin Along strike, the pyrenean orogen can be split into three distinct domains: an eastern domain reaching from the Mediterranean to the Segre River, a central domain extending from the Segre River to the Pamplona Fault, and a western domain beyond the Pamplona Fault.  Northern foreland   Subpyrenean Zone  The Subpyrenean Zone is geologically part of the Aquitaine Basin, the northern foreland of the Pyrenees, and was caught up in the Pyrenean orogeny. The zone was folded during the Eocene and overthrust en echelon by the North Pyrenean Zone along the North Pyrenean Front. These upthrusts change their character in the west and in the east of the orogen, where they become nappe-like, examples being the Bas Adour Nappe in the west and the Corbi√®res Nappe in the east. The latter continues farther east via folds and tectonic slices near Saint-Chinian, via the fold near Montpellier to join the South Provence Thrust near Sainte-Baume, which gradually disappears south of Brignoles. Within the Pyrenees sensu stricto, the Subpyrenean Zone consists of Upper Cretaceous and very thick Paleogene sediments in surface outcrops. The sediments show simple folds following a WNW-ESE trend. The subsurface, however, has a far more complicated structure due to Triassic salt diapirs and north-vergent thrusts. Hidden below a more than 6000 metre thick Mesozoic cover are probably more than 6000 m of Paleozoic basement rocks. The Mesozoic cover consists of up to 1500 m of Triassic, well over 500 m of Jurassic and more than 3000 m of Cretaceous sediments. The up to 500 m thick layer of Lower Triassic (Buntsandstein) comprises conglomerates, breccia, brown sandstones, argillites, shales, and siltstones. The Middle Triassic (Muschelkalk) can attain a thickness of 400 m and shows silty shales, evaporite deposits, and dolomitic micrites. The up to 500 m thick Upper Triassic Keuper deposits are made up of carbonate-rich sediments, salt, siltstones, and intercalated ophitic diabases/olivine dolerites. The lower Lias is a transgressive sequence with up to 200 m of non- marine sandstone, near-shore marine limestone and evaporites. A pelagic fauna at the top suggests open marine conditions. The middle and upper Lias consist of 230 m of shallow marine platform sediments (bioclastic limestone, argillaceous limestone, and micritic limestone). During the Middle Jurassic, an oolitic barrier, made up mostly of argillaceous micrites, separates an outer shelf from an inner shelf. The Upper Jurassic (Malm) deposits are mainly shales and carbonates. Near the end of the Jurassic, restricted environments were established with dolomicrites, banded limestones, and evaporites. The Lower Cretaceous layer starts with sandstones, shales, limestones, and calcareous breccia in the Neocomian, followed by Barremian marls and limestones. During the lower Aptian, sandstones, shales, sandy marls, and limestones were laid down. The upper Aptian and the Albian are mainly marls and limestones. The Upper Cretaceous includes a littoral Turonian with sandstones and sandy limestones. By the beginning of the Senonian (Campanian), a deep trough had formed (the Subpyrenean Basin) receiving a very thick flysch sequence. The Campanian and Maastrichtian flyschs comprise 2000 to 3000 m of periodically interlayered fines (marls, calcareous shales, and mudstones) and coarser sediments (conglomerates, sandstones, and greywackes). Near the K/T boundary, the Subpyrenean Basin was filled with continental red deposits in Garumnian facies even including dinosaur eggs in a few places. At this point, the Subpyrenean Basin underwent folding accompanied by a weak metamorphism. Above the Albian and before the onset of the Campanian, volcanic rocks occur including basaltic lavas, spilite, and diabase, but also pyroclastic rocks like tuff, lapilli tuff, volcanic breccia, and agglomerate. The volcanic rocks can be cross-cut by lamprophyre dikes. In Paleocene/Eocene times, the sea transgressed from the Atlantic into the Subpyrenean Basin which behaved as a downwarp to the slowly rising Pyrenees immediately to the south. A very thick (2000 to 3000 m) succession of fine-grained detrital or calcareous sediments was deposited. The sedimentation stopped in the late Eocene due to major compression (Pyrenean Main Phase). In the vicinity of the Muret Fault, a left- lateral strike-slip fault and a prolongation of the Toulouse Fault to the south, the Subpyrenean Zone can be divided into two unequal halves. The eastern half between the rivers Garonne and Aude can be separated into three different zones (from north to south): * a northern foreland. * a 10 km wide folded zone. Its northern boundary are the ranges of the Petits Pyr√©n√©es, which are above a blind thrust. This zone narrows to the east and disappears before reaching the Aude. The sediments comprise a gypsum‚Äìbearing Triassic at the bottom followed by an internally thrusted Jurassic and a very thick cover sequence of Upper Cretaceous flysch sediments. * a narrow band of flysch in the south. This fairly thick flysch sequence was also deposited in the Upper Cretaceous. It was upturned into a nearly upright position by thrusting movements on the North Pyrenean Front and now forms the overturned southern flank of an asymmetric syncline. In the western half, only the northern foreland is present; it is made up of gently folded, but strongly jointed, epicontinental Mesozoic sediments covered and hidden by Miocene molasse sediments. The east‚Äìwest and northwest‚Äìsoutheast-striking fold sets interfere and are cut by northeast-trending faults. In the subsurface, Triassic salt diapirs are also present. Within the northern foreland east of the river Aude, the Paleozoic basement uplift of the Mouthoumet appears, a horst tilted to the south and covered by continental Eocene strata. The fold trains of the Subpyrenean Zone are disrupted in the Bas Languedoc by the Cevennes Fault, a major left-lateral strike-slip fault.  North Pyrenean Zone  The North Pyrenean Zone is quite narrow, usually only about 10 km wide, but can widen to 40 km. It is characterised by very strong folding. The zone is thrust to the north along the North Pyrenean Front‚Äîits northern limit‚Äîover the Subpyrenean Zone. This thrusting motion compressed the overthrust foreland and as a result induced folding in the Subpyrenean Zone. The North Pyrenean Zone is itself overthrust by the Axial Zone along the North Pyrenean Fault (NPF), a high- angle reverse-fault forming its southern boundary. The North Pyrenean Fault is marked by highly strained mylonites. The rocks in the vicinity bear horizontal lineations underlining the importance of the fault as a major shear zone. Elsewhere in the North Pyrenean Zone, the strain gradient is also high but the stretching direction is generally vertical. The more than 6000 m thick sedimentary package of the North Pyrenean Zone is formed by Mesozoic (Jurassic and Cretaceous) rocks that have been detached above Upper Triassic evaporites and subsequently slid to the north. In contrast with the Subpyrenean Zone, the North Pyrenean Zone contains hardly any Paleogene. Upper Triassic (Keuper) shale and evaporite deposits locally contain interbedded dolomites, tuffs, and diabase (ophites); these deposits behave plastically and commonly form a tectonic m√©lange with contacts being expressed as decollement surfaces. From the beginning of the Jurassic till the end of the Lower Cretaceous, a shallow- water carbonate platform developed during tectonic quiescence with mainly limestones being sedimented. The Middle Albian witnessed a major facies change to deep marine conditions. This changeover marks the inception of the North Pyrenean Basin, a 400 km long trough of pull-apart origin filled with unconformable, turbiditic flysch sediments during the Upper Cretaceous. By Upper Albian times, this pull-apart basin had split into an internal trough next to the North Pyrenean fault which accommodated the Flysch ardoisier and an external trough farther north filled by the Flysch noir. Later, during the Turonian and the Coniacian, the external flysch trough received the so-called Flysch √† fucoides, a very thick succession of interbedded calcareous mudstones/marlstones and sandy calcarenites. This flysch is followed by a regressive series in the Maastrichtian‚Äîthick marls (Marnes de Plagne)‚Äîplatform limestones (Calcaires nankins), as well as lagoonal and lacustrine deposits. Altogether the Coniacian-Maastrichtian series reaches a thickness of 3000 m. The Paleozoic basement pierces the sedimentary cover in several almond-shaped, horst-like uplifts, their size ranging from 1 to 300 km2. Examples are the so- called massifs satellites nord-pyr√©n√©ens (north pyrenean basement uplifts) between Lourdes and Perpignan, amongst them the following uplifts: Agly, Arize, Barousse, Bess√®de-de-Sault, Castillon, Milhas, Plantach, Saint- Barth√©l√©my, Salvezines, and Rabat-les-Trois-Seigneurs, plus several uplifts in the northern Basque country. These uplifts have a left-lateral shearing origin and are tilted to the north; simultaneously they also exhibit a vertical shearing component. They probably formed in the Variscan orogeny. In the basement uplifts, mainly Precambrian gneisses and granulitic gneisses (in the Agly massif), and Paleozoic igneous and metamorphic rocks are found. A small, maximally 5 km wide strip just north of the North Pyrenean Fault experienced dynamic and thermal metamorphism during the Albian/Cenomanian about 110 million years ago (high temperature/low pressure, \\"HT/LP\\"-type). Some domains north of the basement uplifts were also metamorphosed (e.g. in the Bigorre and in the southern Corbi√®res). The metamorphism was isochemical without introduction of extraneous elements and affected only the sedimentary cover rocks which were transformed into marble and hornfels. The Paleozoic basement was not affected, probably due to its already dehydrated state. Lherzolite from the North Pyrenean Zone, L'√âtang de Lers, Ari√®ge Scattered within the metamorphic strip are several occurrences of lherzolites (including their type locality at Lers). They were extruded from the upper mantle along deep- reaching faults. The lherzolites are associated with amphibolites, pyroxenites, and amphibole-bearing peridotites. All these mantle rocks are arranged in swarms, the biggest outcrop at Moncaup reaching a mere 3 km2. They are widely distributed, being found from B√©arn all the way to Aude. Their emplacement mode has not been clarified yet, but the following factors are relevant: * associated Jurassic and lower Cretaceous marbles of the metamorphic band. * granulites of the basement uplifts in the vicinity. * migmatitic kinzigites. * the close spatial association with the North Pyrenean Fault a bit farther south. * lherzolite sedimentary clasts occur in marbles of the metamorphic strip, so the lherzolites must be older than the metamorphism. Scattered within the North Pyrenean Zone are also some occurrences of volcanic rocks. They are intercalated in sediments of the Lias and the Upper Cretaceous (Aptian till Campanian) and are found mainly in the west (near Tarbes, Orthez, and in the Basque country). They consist of silica undersaturated spilites, picrites, and nepheline syenites. Associated dike rocks are lamprophyres (camptonites and monchiquites). Other features of interest are several different post-metamorphic breccia formations. The North Pyrenean Zone can be subdivided into three subzones bounded by major faults: * a northern subzone. Its sedimentary cover has detached from the basement uplifts farther south. It contains flysch from the Upper Cretaceous. * an intermediate subzone. Here the basement uplifts crop out. * a southern subzone. It was affected by metamorphism and contains outcrops of ultramafic rocks. The North Pyrenean Zone is traversed in the west by NNE-SSW-trending, left-lateral strike-slip faults and then changes into the fold-belt of the Basque country. In the east, it continues after a sharp bend in the Corbi√®res right into southern Provence. At the far eastern end, northwest-southeast-striking Miocene fold trains of the Western Alps start interfering and finally completely overwhelm the pyrenean structures.  Axial Zone  Maladeta, a granodiorite massif in the Axial Zone, with glacier and Paleozoic cover sediments (front right) The Axial Zone, also called Primary Axial Zone, is a huge basement dome of Precambrian and Paleozoic (Primary) rocks folded and metamorphosed during the Variscan orogeny and intruded by late-stage Variscan granitoids. All the highest peaks of the Pyrenees are in the Axial Zone, hence the name. Amongst the Variscan granitoids are biotite granites (Canigou, Qu√©rigut Massif), two-mica granites (Caillaouas Massif) and granodiorites (Bassi√®s, Maladeta). The granitoids are mainly shallow epizonal intrusives, but mesozonal and catazonal rocks are also represented. The high elevations of the Axial Zone (generally above 3000 m) are compensated isostatically by an increased thickness of the continental crust. For instance below the Maladeta massif, a root zone formed so that the Mohorovicic discontinuity is encountered there at a depth of 50 km. Likewise over most peaks of the Axial Zone, a negative gravity anomaly can be detected which slowly disappears to the east. The basement is traversed by major east‚Äìwest-striking, late Variscan fracture zones that were reactivated during the alpine orogeny cycle. In the eastern part of the Axial Zone, the fractures are generally upright, a good example being the mylonitic Merens Fault at Pic del Port Vell near M√©rens-les-Vals. In the western part, the fractures are more gently dipping to the north and behave as en echelon thrusts arranged in a northwest-southeasterly fashion; along these fractures, the basement of the Axial Zone overthrusts Mesozoic sedimentary units to the south. Good examples are the en echelon thrusts at Eaux Chaudes, Gavarnie and B√©nasque‚ÄîLas Nogueras (referring to the upper reaches of the rivers Noguera Ribagorzana and Noguera Pallaresa). Concomitant with the thrusts, a schistosity developed that affected the basement as well as the sedimentary cover implying an alpine origin. All these fractures account for an overall compression of the Axial Zone by 20% which translates as roughly 10 to 20 km of crustal shortening. As a result, the Axial Zone was squeezed into a south-directed antiformal stack. The Axial Zone disappears in the Haut B√©arn as a pericline underneath the Upper Cretaceous sedimentary cover only to reappear in the basement uplifts of Aldud√©s-Quinto R√©al, the southernmost of the Basque basement massifs. In the east the Axial Zone becomes downfaulted into Neogene and Quaternary grabens of Northern Catalonia and finally disappears underneath the Mediterranean. The central and eastern section of the Axial Zone is bounded in the north by the North Pyrenean Fault, a system of N 110-striking, steeply dipping reverse- faults. The trace of the North Pyrenean Fault becomes more and more diffuse west of Lourdes; near the Basque basement massifs, it seems to be displaced to the south by a wrench fault and then possibly continues into Spain south of the Basque Marble Nappe and south of the Basque Fold Belt. In Cantabria, it finally reaches the Atlantic coast. The southern limit of the Axial Zone runs completely on Spanish territory. It is represented by an alpine reverse-fault along which the sediments of the South Pyrenean Zone are overthrust by the Axial Zone. In the east, the Axial Zone abuts directly against nappes of eastern representatives of the Sierras Marginales.  South Pyrenean Zone  Monte Perdido, an internal sedimentary thrust unit of the northwestern South Pyrenean Zone. The South Pyrenean Zone consists of a Mesozoic-Eocene sedimentary sequence which has detached from the Axial Zone within evaporitic horizons of the Middle or Upper Triassic and consequently was transported southward. The basement of this sequence does not outcrop. The southward motion was \\"channelised\\" by two major conjugated faults, in the west by the more or less north‚Äìsouth-trending folds and thrusts near the Cinca river (Mediano and Bolta√±a anticlines), and in the east by the northeast-southwest- trending en echelon wrench faults at the Segre river. At the latter, the thrust system forms a break-back (hindward-thrusting) imbricate emergent fan which developed during the latest Eocene and early Oligocene.Verg√©s, J & Mu√±oz, JA (1990). Thrust sequence in the southern central Pyrenees. Bull. Soc. G√©ol. France. 8:265‚Äì271. Due to constriction, the sedimentary cover was forced into several internal overthrusts, examples being the nappe of the Monte Perdido and the nappe of the Cotiella in the northwest. More centrally placed is the B√≥ixols Thrust Sheet which continues farther east in the Pedraforca Thrust Sheet (upper unit). The B√≥ixols Thrust Sheet is hindward-thrusting but also overrides the Montsec Thrust Sheet to the south. Its sediments reach 5000 m in thickness and are mostly Lower Cretaceous in age. The Montsec Thrust Sheet correlates with the lower unit of the Pedraforca Thrust Sheet. It consists of a 2000 m thick layer of Upper Cretaceous limestone followed by Lower and Middle Eocene syntectonic conglomerate, sandstone and shale. The internal thrusts naturally led to a substantial increase in thickness. The South Pyrenean Zone finally terminates along the South Pyrenean Thrust where the Montsec Thrust Sheet overrides the Sierras Marginales. The thrusting motions that formed an imbricate thrust system with associated piggyback basins took place mainly during the Eocene. The distances travelled by the thrust sheets is still debated, estimates varying from relatively small to as much as 30 to 50 km.  Sierras Marginales  thumb|250px|Geomorphologic map of Catalonia: The Sierras Marginales (Spanish: Border Ranges) are the Sierras Aragonesas and Serres Catalanes of the southern Pre-Pyrenees. They are, much like the South Pyrenean Zone, formed from a Mesozoic-Eocene sedimentary succession, albeit with a much reduced thickness of about 900 m. The succession comprises Keuper, Jurassic, unconformable lower Cretaceous bauxites, unconformable Upper Cretaceous, Paleocene in Garumnian facies, and lower Eocene. Units of the Sierras Marginales underthrust successions of the Ebro Basin. Later on these underthrusts were unconformably covered by Oligocene and Miocene sequences from the Ebro Basin. To the west, the Sierras Marginales are relayed by the Jaca-Pamplona Thrust Sheet which consists of a younger Eocene‚ÄìOligocene sedimentary succession. In this thrust sheet west of the G√°llego River, the structures simplify: in the Basque and in the Cantabrian Pyrenees, the sedimentary cover is affected only by long and relatively open fold trains, which are occasionally pierced by doming Keuper salt. In the east, the Sierras Marginales are represented by the tectonically comparable Port del Comte Thrust Sheet and by the Cad√≠ Thrust Sheet, which are made up essentially of an Eocene succession. The Sierras Marginales are overthrust in the north by the Montsec Thrust Sheet of the South Pyrenean Zone. The end of the southward directed thrusting motions was diachronous and migrated from east to west. For instance in the Cad√≠ Thrust Sheet, motions stopped 34 million years ago (Eocene/Oligocene boundary), whereas in the Jaca- Pamplona Thrust Sheet they stopped as late as 23 million years ago (Oligocene/Miocene boundary).Verg√©s, J (1999).

Evoluci√≥ cinem√†tica en 3D., Servei Geol√≤gic, Monografia T√®cnica, 7, 192 pp.  Southern foreland  The Southern foreland of the pyrenean orogen is the Ebro Basin or Ebro Foreland Basin. It can be divided into a Southern Folded Foreland section in the northeastern Catalan sector and a basically undeformed flat-lying main section taking up the rest. Like the Subpyrenean Zone in the north, the Southern Folded Foreland was also affected by the thrusting motions of the Sierras Marginales and their easterly representatives. The induced folding intensity decreases the farther one moves away from the thrust fronts until one reaches the undeformed Ebro Basin. The fold trends follow more or less the pyrenean direction or parallel to the thrust fronts, but turn NE-SW near the Segre River (e.g. the Oliana Anticline). The sedimentary succession in the Ebro Basin shows Paleozoic rocks at the base followed by uppermost Cretaceous/lowermost Paleocene red beds and Eocene limestones, marine marls, and Upper Eocene evaporites (Cardona evaporites). The lower Oligocene is conglomeratic and pro-grades southward into evaporite and lacustrine deposits. In the Southern Folded Foreland, the folded Paleogene series are unconformably overlain by flat-lying non-marine Miocene and Pliocene strata of the main Ebro Basin. The Ebro Basin deepens towards the South Pyrenean Frontal Fault where it comprises 3000 m of sedimentary infill. This reduces to 1500 m near the thrust front of the Sierra Marginales. The deepest part of the basin with 5000 m of sediments is near Logro√±o at its most northwestern end.  Evolution of the orogen  Due to its polycyclic geological evolution, the Pyrenees can be attributed to two major orogenic cycles: * a prealpine cycle. * an alpine cycle.  Prealpine orogenic cycle   Precambrian  Structural and petrological studies in metamorphic rocks of the Axial Zone and of the North Pyrenean Zone were able to prove the existence of incorporated Precambrian remnants. For example, in the basement of the Canigou massif and in the basement uplift of the Agly, the remnants of a Precambrian basement were discovered (recognised by radiometric dating on granitoids and by certain structures of tectonic origin), which were later incorporated into the Variscan orogen by tectonic movements and the associated metamorphism. The original radiometric results were, however, not confirmed by the SHRIMP-method (only Ordovician ages between 477 and 471 million years were found).Cocherie, A et al. (2005). U-Pb zircon (ID-TIMS and SHRIMP) evidence for the early Ordovician intrusion of metagranites in the Late Proterozoic Canaveilles Group of the Pyrenees and the Montagne Noire (France). Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France, 176:269‚Äì282 (summary). The Cadomian origin of the basement is therefore uncertain. The Precambrian rocks are mainly gneisses and meta-sediments of amphibolite and granulite facies intruded by charnockites.  Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic  The Cambro-Ordovician metamorphic rocks comprise migmatites of upper amphibolite facies grade, mica schists with andalusite, cordierite and staurolite of lower amphibolite facies grade, and phyllites of greenschist facies grade. The epicontinental, psammitic sediments of the Neoproterozoic and the Lower Paleozoic are a very thick detrital (mudstone-sandstone) succession essentially devoid of fossils. These sediments were in a large part later overprinted by the Variscan orogeny. Intercalated near the base of the detrital succession are carbonates. The (meta)sedimentary succession starts with the 2000 to 3000 m thick Canaveilles Group in the Ediacarian about 580 million years ago. Its sediments consist mainly of shales and greywackes with intercalated rhyolites and carbonates. Within the Cad√≠ Thrust Sheet archeocyathid‚Äìbearing limestones developed during the Lower Cambrian. At the onset of the Middle Cambrian, the Canaveilles Group is replaced by the Jujols Group, a 2000 m thick flyschoid series comprising schists, shales, and siltstones interlayered with carbonates and quartzites. The Jujols Group is less metamorphic than the mesozonal Canaveilles Group. Its sedimentation lasted probably into the lowermost Ordovician. After a longer hiatus, up to 100 m of Caradocian (Ordovician stage 5 and 6) conglomerate follow unconformably upon the Jujols Group‚Äîthe Rabassa Conglomerate. This is overlain by nearly 500 m of the Cava Formation, interlayered greywackes, and shales containing volcanic horizons. The 200 m thick Estana Formation is made up of limestones and calcareous shales. Its end‚ÄìOrdovician limestones contain a benthic fauna (brachiopods, bryozoans, cystoids) as well as conodonts. The succession ends with the badly layered Ansobell Formation (20 to 300 m), dark schists that bear microconglomerates indicating a glaciomarine depositional environment. The Ansobell Formation can develop an unconformity and sometimes follows directly upon the Cava Formation. The included volcanic rocks and the conglomerates hint at unsettled tectonic conditions, which are probably connected with an early stage of the Caledonian orogeny (Taconian Phase). During the Rhuddanian (Silurian) initially 20 m of quartzitic rocks, the Bar Quartzite, were deposited followed by 50 to 250 m of dark, graphitic, graptolite-bearing shales. The thickness of the shales can increase in the West to 850 m. They take up nearly the entire Silurian (Aeronian until Pridoli), documented by the graptolites. In their upper section (Ludlow), the shales incorporate calcareous horizons and calcareous nodules (with conodonts, nautiloids, bivalves, crinoids, and ostracods). Close to the Basque massifs, the calcareous facies changes into a detritic facies of interlayered sand‚Äì and silt‚Äìstones. The graptolite-bearing shales were later metamorphosed into lower amphibolite facies slates. They form prominent d√©collement surfaces. The Devonian is marine and rich in fossils (spiriferids and trilobites like phacops). It consists of six depositional areas (and a wealth of formations) differing considerably in their sedimentary evolution (especially in the Basque Pyrenees). Generally in the western Pyrenees, shallow marine facies prevail, whereas in the eastern Pyrenees, hemipelagic facies with occasional high grounds predominate. The Devonian has highly variable thicknesses, its 100‚Äì600 m‚Äîand in places 1400 ‚Äîthick succession is made up of many different sedimentary facies like greywackes, reefal limestones, and sandstones. Quite distinctive are banded pink to red, blue or green limestones and nodular limestones, the so-called griottes of the lower Famennian. Calcareous shales and black shales also occur. The Lochkovian consists of black shales and limestones and is very rich in conodonts. During the Pragian, a siliciclastic wedge formed, the San Silvestre Quartzite of the Basib√© Formation. The period Upper Givetian till Frasnian witnessed pronounced lithological differences and increased sedimentation rates. In the Lower Frasnian, reef complexes developed, yet at the same time siliciclastic material was being delivered into the western, central, and Basque domain. At the beginning of the Middle Famennian, the sedimentation in the Pyrenees became more uniform again and until the end of the Devonian, monotonous, condensed cephalopod-bearing limestones were laid down (Griotte limestones and grey to pinkish, nodular Supragriotte limestones). Towards the end of the Famennian, first hiati started to appear leading to complete emersion of the western Pyrenees at the onset of the Mississippian. The corresponding unconformity, which exists only in the western Pyrenees, belongs to an early deformation phase of the Variscan orogeny (Breton Phase). Only in the western Pyrenees is the Lower Carboniferous (Mississippian) distinguished from the Devonian sediments by an unconformity, starting off marine with a transgressive quartz‚Äìpebble bed. Anywhere else, the Supragriotte limestones are conformably overlain by pre- orogenic sediments that begin with the Lower Cherts of the Tournaisian. The Lower Cherts comprise 50 m of black, phosphate nodule-bearing cherts interlayered with black shales. After an interlude of grey, nodular, goniatite-bearing limestones, the Upper Cherts were deposited during the Vis√©an‚Äîgrey or green cherts sometimes interlayered with pyroclastics and ending with grey nodular limestones. The Mississippian later on changes into the nearly 1000 m thick detrital, syn-orogenic sediments of the Kulm‚Äìfacies. An exception are the western Pyrenees, where, during the Serpukhovian, dark grey, laminated limestones precede the Kulm. The diachronous Kulm sediments are a flysch-like (turbidites) interlayering of sandstones and dark shales‚Äîharbingers of the Variscan tectonic movements. They also contain layers of hemipelagic limestones, conglomerates, carbonaceous breccias as well as olistoliths. Sedimentation of the Kulm facies started in the East already at the Vis√©an/Serpukhovian boundary (Namurian), but west of the Gall√©go river, it started only at the beginning of the Pennsylvanian (Upper Westphalian, Bashkirian). In the Basque Pyrenees, the Kulm sedimentation perdured into the Moskovian. The Kulm sediments were deposited as canyon deposits on the continental slope or as submarine fans in a southwest migrating foredeep of the Variscan orogen.  Variscan orogeny  The Variscan orogeny is expressed as an important unconformity within the Paleozoic sedimentary succession, usually placed above the Lower Westphalian (Bashkirian) and below the Stephanian (Moscovian), but sometimes already below the Upper Westphalian. The tectonic movements therefore happened about 310 million years ago, dated by fossil plants. The Upper Westphalian shows an important unconformity at its base and is made up of conglomerates. The Moscovian is represented by blue- black shales, overlain by the so-called Grey Unit of the Kasimovian (Stephanian B) and the Transitional Layers of the Gzhelian (Stephanian C and Autunian). These sediments are non-metamorphic or only weakly metamorphosed, whereas the sediments below the unconformity fully experienced the Variscan metamorphism. The far-reaching effects of the Variscan orogeny influenced the pyrenean domain in many ways. Of prime importance were the compressional stresses that folded the Paleozoic sediments. Several fold generations developed, sometimes superimposing each other. Associated with the folds are schistosities. The Paleozoic sediments and its Precambrian basement were also metamorphosed under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions (HP/LT). In places anatexis was reached, an example being the melting of some Precambrian gneisses of the Prevariscan basement together with their enveloping mica schists. Another important consequence of the orogeny was late-orogenic magmatism emplacing granitoids (granodiorites and biotite granites) of mainly acid but occasionally also of basic composition. Amongst these granitoids are deep-seated, rather diffuse, intrusive bodies associated with migmatites, yet also typical, well-defined plutons often rising into the cores of anticlines within the Variscan fold-belt. The main magmatism perdured from 310‚Äì270 million years (late Pennsylvanian and early Permian cooling ages). A good example for the main magmatism is the 280 million years old Maladeta granodiorite. Also of importance was late-stage fracturing under brittle conditions. The developing fractures probably followed weak zones already initiated during the Paleozoic. The main direction of these fractures is WNW- ESE, the so-called Pyrenean direction, an excellent example being the North Pyrenean Fault. These fractures will play a decisive role during the further development of the orogen.  Alpine orogenic cycle  Also compare with: Aquitaine Basin ‚Äî Sedimentary evolution  Pennsylvanian, Permian and Lower Triassic  Pic du Midi d'Ossau, remnant of a Permian volcanic edifice The sediments deposited after the Asturian Phase in the Upper Westphalian (Moscovian) right through to the Upper Triassic can be regarded as molasse of the Variscan orogen which underwent late-stage extension. In half-grabens 2500 of sediment accumulated at the close of the Carboniferous and throughout the Permian, mainly interbedded non-marine and basaltic-andesitic rocks.Vissers, RLM (1992). Variscan extension in the Pyrenees. Tectonics, 11:1369‚Äì1384 (summary, revue). Detrital formations of lacustrine affinity with coal measures during the Stephanian (Kasimovian and Gzhelian) followed by red sandstones with plant remains during the Permian are typical erosional products of a chain not having reached stability. The Grey Unit of the Kasimovian is a sequence of decreasing grain-size, starting with breccias and conglomerates and changing into sandstones and coal-bearing shales (anthracite is mined near Campo de la Troya). Also included are andesitic layers that can attain significant thicknesses in places. The Transitional Layers are also a sequence of decreasing grain-size (conglomerates, sandstones, and coal-bearing shales), but, instead of andesites, they include tuffs and rhyodacitic lavas. They close with lacustrine limestones containing stromatolites, charophytes, and ostracods. The continental red beds of the Permian rest unconformably on the Transitional Layers. They show strong variations in their thicknesses and reach 800 m, sometimes even 1000 m. They occur mainly in the Basque Pyrenees and in the Axial Zone. Like the Stephanian sediments, they were deposited as alluvial (as fans and in ephemeral streams) and lacustrine sediments within transtensive basins of the Variscan orogen. The aforementioned fractures were decisive in determining facies distributions during this interval. They also influenced the distribution of volcanic eruptions during the Permian such as the calcalkaline volcanism at Pic du Midi d'Ossau and the basalts of the Basque country. The trigger for these volcanic eruptions probably was early wrenching motions of Iberia relative to the Eurasian Plate. In the Axial Zone, the Permian can be subdivided into three sedimentary series (from top to bottom): * La Pe√±a de Marcanton series. It reaches a thickness of 500 m and is mainly fine-grained. * Pic Baralet series. Up to 300 m thick. It is composed of polygenic conglomerates with Paleozoic limestone fragments embedded in red sandstone. The series rests partially unconformable on the Somport series. * Somport series. A generally fine-grained series that can attain 300 m in thickness and is composed of red to purple claystones. It rests unconformably on the Transitional Layers. The detrital Lower Triassic (Buntsandstein) is very similar to the Permian. It reaches 400 to 500 m in thickness and is made up of coarse conglomerates, sandstones, psammites with plant remains (Equisetites, Coniferomyelon) as well as green and red to purple claystones. At this time, the peneplanation of the Variscan orogen had reached an advanced stage and the sedimentary accommodation spaces started to widen.  Middle Triassic till Upper Jurassic  The sedimentary successions from the Middle Triassic to the Upper Jurassic are very similar on both sides of the Pyrenees. During Muschelkalk times, the sea advanced again, but reached only the North Pyrenean Zone and the Basque country. The resulting sediments left behind are 20 to 100 m of dolomitic cellular limestones, grey fossiliferous limestones, and wavy limestones. In the Upper Triassic (Keuper), the sedimentation spread over the entire Pyrenean domain. About 220 m million years ago (during the Carnian) evaporites settled out in lagoons and grabens‚Äîvariegated, gypsum‚Äìbearing, iron-rich clays, gypsum, anhydrite, dolomitic marls, dolomites, rock salt as well as potassium and magnesium salts occur. The evaporites served later as major decollement horizons. At the limit, Upper Triassic/Hettangian doleritic tholeiites (ophites) formed in the Pyrenees and in the southern Aquitaine Basin, indicating further movements along the fracture zones (submarine fissure eruptions and sills in unsolidified Keuper sediments). The sedimentation during the Jurassic is characterised by the growth of a carbonate platform. The sediments are mainly epicontinental deposits of lacustrine character, as well as limestones, marls and dolomites with marine or littoral faunas. The basin was under tension during this period and as a result long horsts and graben structures of different subsidence rates were created following more or less the trend of the Variscan fractures. Its northern side is rimmed by the relatively stable Aquitanian shelf. The basin probably is caused by crustal thinning infiltrating from the Atlantic domain. The Lias started with a transgression that is more important than the advances of the Muschelkalk and Keuper seas. Its total thickness varies between 150 and 400 m. The sea level kept rising during the Hettangian and fossiliferous limestones were deposited; this trend reversed later on into a regression leaving evaporites (rock salt and anhydrite with some calcareous interlayers). At the edge of the basin and in the eastern Pyrenees, argillaceous limestones and banded dolomites with layers of anhydrite settled out; the dolomites transformed upon dissolution of the anhydrite into monogenic breccias. The regression continued during the Lower Sinemurian, sedimenting intra‚Äì and supra‚Äìtidal banded limestones and dolomites. In the Upper Sinemurian (Lotharingian), more open-marine conditions established themselves due to a renewed sea-level rise; in deeper parts of the basin, fossiliferous limestones developed, whereas, on high ground, oolithic limestones accumulated. The Middle Lias (Pliensbachian) started off transgressive as well with fine-grained detrital, limey to marly sediments (ferruginous oolites, fossiliferous limestones and marls) that change over to marls. In the eastern Pyrenees, pyrite-bearing claystones formed due to a badly oxygenated environment; they contain a very diverse fauna of ammonites belonging to the French southeastern domain, whereas the ammonite population on the Atlantic side is rather monotonous. During the Upper Lias (Toarcian), the sea reached a high stand, continuing with the fine-grained detrital sedimentation and depositing black pelagic marls (marnes noires and schistes esquilleux). Towards the end of the Lias, regressive tendencies again became noticeable. Falling sea levels continued right into the Middle Jurassic. Near Pau an oolite barrier started to grow that extends all the way north to Poitiers. It divided the sedimentary basin now into two major facies domains: a deeper western domain open to the Atlantic and undergoing infratidal sedimentation (black to blueish argillaceous limestones rich in benthic organisms, microfilaments, and ammonites) and a shallow, enclosed, eastern domain with intertidal sedimentation (variable carbonate facies like pseudo- oolites and banded dolomites, but also anhydrite-bearing evaporites). These intertidal sediments experienced a strong contemporaneous dolomitization. Towards the end of the Middle Jurassic, sea levels fell even further.  Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous  During the Upper Jurassic (Tithonian) and especially during the Lower Cretaceous, drastic changes occurred. Iberia started to rift off the Armorican Massif in a southerly direction and in its wake the Bay of Biscay slowly began to spread (with formation of oceanic crust from the Middle Albian till the end of the Coniacian). The sedimentation in the Malm (total thickness 600 to 750 m) did not increase until the Upper Oxfordian, the Lower Oxfordian rarely being present. The 100 to 150 m thick Upper Oxfordian is represented west of the oolite barrier by intratidal platform sediments (argillaceous to sandy, pyrite-bearing limestones), whereas, in the east, dolomitization continues. By Kimmeridgian times, the facies differences attenuated due to shallowing of the western domain, resulting in massive, fine-grained, black, lithographic limestones and fine- grained platy limestones. During the Tithonian, strong regressive tendencies set in that led to a complete withdrawal of the sea. In the Basque country, the sea had withdrawn already at the end of the Kimmeridgian. During times of falling sea levels, evaporitic, dolomitic, lagoonal, and lacustrine facies were left behind. After a southeasterly re-advance of the sea in the Berriasian via a small strait east of Pau, which deposited 100 m of inter‚Äì to sub‚Äìtidal limestones and a sandy to clayey detrital border facies, emersion set in during the Neocomian. During Valanginian and Hauterivian times, clayey marls on top of the emerged horsts were transformed under ferralitic climatic conditions into bauxites, which were fossilised by later transgressions. After another marine transgression from the east during the Barremian, the elongated graben regions in the Pyrenean domain received 200 to 300 m of marine shelf sediments of the Urgonian facies, such as dolomites, algal limestones, foraminiferous limestones, and rudist limestones. The Urgonian facies can perdure in the Corbi√®res and in the South Pyrenean Zone into the Albian. With falling sea levels in the Upper Barremian, black, pyrite-bearing claystones and lagoonal limestones rich in ostracods and characeans were sedimented. After the Barremian/Aptian boundary, marked by another high stand of the sea, there were four more sea-level oscillations during the Aptian and the Albian, bringing about a very significant sediment accumulation (in some places up to 3000 m). Due to sinking grabens in the Atlantic domain, the water masses of the Atlantic and the Tethys mixed for the first time. The Aptian/Albian sediments are characterised by the competitive interplay between fine-grained terrigenic and organic material. The organic material is responsible for the formation of shallow platforms built by rudists, hexacorals, and algae. In the Upper Albian, the terrigenic material predominated, and several shallow marine, partially calcareous sandstone formations were deposited. The source region of the detrital material was the Aragon/Pyrenees domain that was undergoing a first epirogenetic uplift. In the same context, the fluvial delta sediments of the Formation de Mixe were transported from the south, and the very heterogeneous, up to 1000 m thick conglomerates of the Poudingues de Mendibelza, interpreted as the topset of a delta-front.  Upper Cretaceous  Just before the onset of the Upper Cretaceous, the pyrenean domain had separated in the Albian into two very different sedimentary facies realms. On the northern edge of Iberia (in the South Pyrenean Zone and in the Axial Zone), shelf carbonates were then being deposited. Because of several emersions, they only show very reduced thicknesses. Due to transtension in the North Pyrenean Zone, a very strongly subsiding flysch basin (North Pyrenean Basin) developed, which follows essentially the east‚Äìwest-trending Variscan fracture zones. The basin was deepening towards the Atlantic and shallowing towards the east, where it terminates before the Aude river. It is split by the basement massifs of the North Pyrenean Zone into two strands‚Äîa southerly strand called sillon aturien, which received up to 2500 m of flysch ardoisier and a northerly strand with the flysch noir. The flysch basin is rimmed to the north by the relatively stable Aquitanian Shelf. It was formed probably by extensive crustal thinning that penetrated from the Atlantic side. Concurrent with the transtension, the Pyrenean Metamorphism took place characterised by high heat flow (peak temperatures were 500‚Äì600 ¬∞C) but relatively low pressures (HT/LP-metamorphism). Under these conditions, new minerals like biotite, diopside and scapolite grew. The metamorphism is diachronous and has been dated radiometrically in the eastern North Pyrenean Zone as Albian, whereas in the Basque country in the west (for example in the Basque Marble Nappe) it has been dated only as Campanian. It is possible that the metamorphism lasted in a milder form until the end of the Cretaceous or even the beginning of the Eocene. Two major deformational phases with the development of schistosities (Upper Albian till Lower Cenomanian and Santonian till Maastrichtian) affected the pyrenean domain during the Upper Cretaceous expressing themselves as unconformities in the sedimentary record. The flysch basin was shortened and at the northern edge of Iberia, an orogenic wedge formed that moved slowly into the northern foreland. As a consequence, the flysch basin receiving the erosional products from the wedge was forced to migrate to the north too (changeover during the Santonian of the centre of subsidence from the North Pyrenean Basin to the Subpyrenean Basin). The Subpyrenean Basin was consequently filled in by 1000 to 4000 m of flysch √† fucoides. The Variscan fracture zones were active during the entire Upper Cretaceous and decisively influenced the sedimentary facies distributions. This activity was further underlined by alkaline magmatism lasting from the Middle Albian until the end of the Coniacian; thus in the west of the North Pyrenean Zone, submarine basaltic lavas extruded, while farther east in the B√©arn and in the Bigorre, different magmatic rock types intruded the Upper Cretaceous strata.  Cenozoic  The sedimentary sequences of the Paleocene highlight the differences between the eastern and the western Pyrenees. In the west, the marine shelf facies continued and the flysch basin carried on subsiding. In the east, the continental red beds of the Garumnian facies (whose deposition started already at the close of the Cretaceous) were laid down, mainly alluvial and paludial facies. At the same time, the first tectonic shortenings and uplifts affected the eastern Pyrenees. In the western Pyrenees, the marine sedimentation also carried on during the Eocene. In two subsiding basins on both sides of today's chain, limestones, marls, foraminiferous sandstones, and sandstones with a benthic fauna were sedimented. The Eocene sedimentary successions along the French northern edge of the Pyrenees (in the North Pyrenean Zone) are fairly thin and full of facies changes. There, short-lived transgressions and regressions can be followed into the Languedoc. During the Ypresian, the first conglomerates start being delivered. This very thick conglomeratic formation, called the Poudingues de Palassou, is the indicator for the most important orogenic phase in the Pyrenean domain, the Pyrenean Main Phase, which was accompanied by very strong deformations and uplifts. The conglomerates are later unconformably overlain by end‚ÄìEocene strata, therefore the orogenic phase can be assigned to the interval Ypresian/Lutetian, i.e. roughly 50 to 40 million years ago. On the southern side of the Pyrenees in Catalonia, folded conglomeratic formations have been dated as Upper Lutetian to Bartonian, representing the interval 44 to 37 million years ago. They also are unconformably overlain by end‚ÄìEocene sediments bearing a continental fauna. The Pyrenean Main Phase manifested itself on both sides of the axial zone as reverse faults and thrusts with fairly large displacements. The movements were directed on the French side to the north, and on the Spanish side to the south. But their spatial arrangement was not symmetrical; the Spanish side for instance has much lower dipping structures. The faulting and thrusting disrupted not only the Mesozoic and Paleogene sedimentary cover, but also large parts of the Variscan basement. The basement had failed not just rigidly at the Paleozoic fracture systems, but also underwent intensive alpine deformations around heterogeneities and anisotropies in its structural fabric. Deformational phases of lesser importance followed the Pyrenean Main Phase, all contributing to the final appearance of the orogen. At the northern margin of the Ebro Basin close to the Sierras Marginales, for example, folded Oligocene is covered unconformably by flat-lying, detrital Miocene of continental origin. This points to another deformational phase at the end of the Oligocene about 25 million years ago. After the beginning of the Miocene, the uplifted orogen underwent severe erosion, expressed by enormous molasses being shed into the foreland basins such as for example the Aquitaine Basin. In the Pliocene, a renewed uplift started, leading to the formation of huge alluvial fans at the mountain front, a notable example being the Lannemezan alluvial fan. Another important consequence of the uplifting was peneplanation. Several peneplanation levels have been found on very different heights (3000 to 2000 m in the Axial Zone, close to a 1000 m in the Pays de Sault, near 400 m in the Agly massif and at 100 m in the Corbi√®res). They generally become lower in the east, with several uplifts towards the end of the Oligocene, towards the end of the Miocene (Pontian peneplanation), and towards the end of the Pliocene (Villafranchian peneplanation). Neogene sediments have been preserved in the Pyrenees mainly in small grabens close to the Mediterranean (near Cerdagne). The grabens have also repeatedly been flooded by the Mediterranean, examples being the graben near Ampurdan and grabens in the Roussillon containing a Pliocene fauna. These extensional structures most likely owe their existence to renewed movements on Variscan fractures. The very young volcanic area near Olot probably has a similar cause. Ossoue glacier and Pic Montferrat in the Vignemale massif During the Quaternary, the Pyrenees experienced several glaciations, but of far less intensity than for example in the Alps. Large glaciers advanced through the valleys of the Gave d'Ossau, Gave de Pau, Garonne, and Ari√®ge on the French northern side. Today about 20 smaller true glaciers as well as cirques and glacier remnants subsist (examples are the Aneto glacier, the Ossoue glacier in the Vignemale massif and glaciers on Maladeta and Monte Perdido). All these glaciers have undergone a large retreat since 1850 due to global warming. The total glaciated surface area amounted to 45 km2 in 1870, whereas in 2005 a mere 5 km2 were left.  Geodynamic evolution  The Pyrenees have experienced a very long geological evolution with multiple orogenies. Neoproterozoic crustal remains (Canigou, Agly) hint at possible Cadomian domains. Indications for Caledonian movements are somewhat clearer (conglomerates and volcanic rocks in the Ordovician). During the Variscan orogeny in the Pennsylvanian, the Axial Zone and the South Pyrenean Zone became an integral part of what was to become the microcontinent Iberia. The Sierras Marginales were part of the Ebro Block, a northeastern section of Iberia. The appartenance of the North Pyrenean Zone is still uncertain, but the Subpyrenean Zone certainly formed part of the microcontinent Aquitania. Iberia and Aquitania were on the south side of the South Variscan Thrust and therefore constituted the foreland of the Variscan orogen. Both microcontinents had originated from Gondwana's northern margin. At the close of the Variscan orogeny, Iberia was still connected to northwestern France (the Armorican Massif) and most likely was a northwestern prolongation of Aquitania. Its later movements were vital to the alpine cycle of the Pyrenean orogeny. This is accepted by most geologists, yet the details of Iberia's movements are still uncertain. During the Upper Jurassic, a rift was propagating from the spreading Central Atlantic along the continental margin of northwestern France towards Aquitaine. This happened probably as early as the Tithonian. As a consequence, the rift wedged Iberia southward and separated it from the Armorican Massif. In the wake, the continental crust was thinned and eventually oceanic crust was beginning to form in the Middle Aptian‚Äîthe opening of the Bay of Biscay was under way. Final oceanisation of the Bay of Biscay was achieved by Santonian/Campanian times (about 84 million years ago as witnessed by the magnetic polarity chron C 34). Paleomagnetic studies additionally show an anticlockwise 35¬∞ rotation of Iberia. The drifting motion of Iberia had taken up the entire Lower Cretaceous. Due to the rotational motion, the northeastern edge of Iberia started to interfere with Aquitania, first creating transtensional pull-aparts along the North Pyrenean Zone in the Middle Albian. The crustal thinning associated with the transtensional rifting process led to HT/LP metamorphism in the North Pyrenean Zone, its onset being dated at about 108 million years ago. At the same time, the lherzolites were finally emplaced. The transcurrent motion along the North Pyrenean pull-apart zone was also accompanied by alkaline magmatism that lasted from the Middle Albian to the end of the Coniacian. The slow progression of the metamorphism into the west seems to imply a large sinistral shearing between Iberia and Aquitania, estimated as an offset of about 200 km (the metamorphism reached the Basque Country only about 80 million years ago in the Campanian). By the beginning of the Turonian about 90 million years ago, the transtensional regime had finished and was replaced by compression. The rifting in the Basquo-Cantabrian, North Pyrenean, and Subpyrenean Basin had stopped and basin inversion set in; tensional faults were then being used as thrusts. This first rather weak compressional phase with very low shortening rates (less than 0.5 mm/year) lasted till the end of the Thanetian. On the Spanish side of the orogen, the first thrust sheets were emplaced (Upper Pedraforca, B√≥ixols, and Turb√≥n thrust sheets). In Ilerdian and Cuisian times (Paleocene/Eocene boundary, Thanetian/Ypresian, about 55 million years ago), the Pyrenees underwent very strong compression in the upper crust, bringing about the orogen's actual zonation and structural organisation. The orogen was squeezed into an asymmetric fan-like structure due to the aborted subduction of Iberia underneath Aquitania. This is inferred from the behaviour of the Mohorovicic discontinuity, which at the North Pyrenean Fault abruptly jumps from 30 to 50 km depth. This Pyrenean Main Phase lasted till about 47 million years ago (beginning of the Lutetian), showing high shortening rates of 4.0 to 4.4 mm/year and emplacing for example the Lower Pedraforca and the Montsec thrust sheets.Verg√©s, J. et al. (2002). The Pyrenean orogen: pre‚Äì, syn‚Äì and postcollisional evolution. In: Rosenbaum, G. and Lister, GS. (2002). Reconstruction of the evolution of the Alpine-Himalayan Orogen. Journal of the Virtual Explorer, 8:55‚Äì74. After the Pyrenean Main Phase, other compressional deformational phases followed during the Oligocene and the Pliocene. Since the Neogene, the orogen exhibits post-kinematic collapse (graben structures at its eastern end, volcanism near Olot) associated with the extension of the Golfe de Lion and the opening of the Valencia Trough. The orogen still undergoes strong erosion (since the Eocene), isostatic movements, post-kinematic extension, and even renewed compression (in the western Pyrenees) that can cause medium-sized earthquakes (a magnitude 5,1 earthquake near Arudy in 1980Courjault-Rad√© P, Darrozes J, & Gaillot P.

Structural interpretations  The aforementioned asymmetric fan-like, flower-like structural organisation of the Pyrenean orogen has so far been interpreted as follows:Banda E & Wickham SM. (1986). The geological evolution of the Pyrenees. Tectonophysics, 129(1‚Äì4), 381 pp. * as a near-vertical collisional structure with the thrust-faults rooted in vertical faults. * as an allochthonous orogen, with Iberia thrust over the Eurasian plate, i.e. Aquitania. * as an allochthonous orogen, with Aquitania having overridden Iberia. The vertical faults are presumed to flatten at depth. Current opinions favour Iberia subducting beneath Aquitania; this interpretation seems to be supported by the results of deep seismic (ECORS)Choukroune, P. et al. (1990). Major Hercynian thrusts along the ECORS Pyrenees and Biscay lines. Bull. Soc. G√©ol. Ser. 8(6):313‚Äì320 (summary). and magnetotelluric profiling Pous, J, Ledo JJ, Queralt P, and Mu√±oz JA. (1995). Constraints on the Deep Structure of the Pyrenees, 8(4):395‚Äì400. See also New geophysical constrains on the deep structure of the Pyrenees, Geophysical Research Letters 27:1037‚Äì1040, 2000. across the orogen. Estimates of the overall shortening across the Pyrenean orogen are mostly between 100 and 150 km. Using the ECORS-data Mu√±oz (1992) arrives at 147 km of shortening with the subduction of the Iberian middle and lower crust taking up around 110 km.Mu√±oz, JA (1992): Evolution of a continental collision belt: ECORS-Pyrenees crustal balanced cross section. In: Thrust Tectonics (KR McClay, Ed.). Chapman & Hall, London; 235‚Äì246. summary). Further interpretations of the ECORS-data led to the recognition of a 50 km thick Iberian crust that was subducting beneath the 30 km thick Aquitanian crust. As a consequence, a low-angle intracrustal detachment level formed at 15 km depth, above the subducting middle and lower Iberian crust. Along this detachment, the rocks now making up the Axial Zone, the South Pyrenean Zone, and the Sierras Marginales were gliding southward and gradually ramping up to the surface. With continuing constriction, the Axial Zone buckled up into a south-directed antiformal stack. Towards the end of the subduction, a backthrust initiated near the actual trace of the North Pyrenean Fault, which was cutting upward into the Aquitanian crust by utilising its previously thinned, faulted nature. When the subduction process was finally blocked, parts of the northern Axial Zone and the North Pyrenean Zone with lower crustal fragments and lherzolites sandwiched in between were pushed back northward over the Subpyrenean Zone.

Since forming in 2003 they have released a demo in 2004, a full-length album in 2006, a 10\\" split in 2007, a self-titled 10\\" EP in 2009, a 7\\" split and a 2xLP in 2011. They are said to have the loud and heavy elements of sludge American underground, with DIY/punk ideas, ethics and touring style; Open minded to many different forms of music, sound and experimentation, but with more European funeral doom and death metal influences than anything. History After forming in 2003 Beneath Oblivion went on to record a demo titled 'The Melancholy Demo' in 2004 before recording and self-releasing their first album 'Existence Without Purpose' on CD in 2006. Originally sold at shows and through the band the album received worldwide acclaim, garnering positive reviews from as far afield as Russia as well as in their home country. Following the release the band toured extensively,http://www.chicagoreader.com/TheBlog/archives/2008/12/18/weekend- kumas-doom-fest increasing awareness of their music both in the Cincinnati area and nationwide. In 2007 Beneath Oblivion recorded a split LP with the Providence, Rhode Island band Sin of Angels. The split album was released on the independent label 43rd Parallel and was limited to 500 copies, 150 on green vinyl and 350 on black . In 2008 they were signed to the Athens, Georgia-based record label The Mylene Sheath. They went on to release their first record for The Mylene Sheath on February 10, 2009. A self-titled 10\\" record, the album was released exclusively on vinyl and limited to 500 copies: 100 clear with white swirl available exclusively from the band at shows, 100 black available exclusively from The Mylene Sheath web store, and 300 pressed in translucent red with white swirl. Both the mail order and show exclusive versions sold out very quickly. The record was a substantial step forward from the first album, going beyond the traditional boundaries of doom and sluge metal. The release was supported with a number of shows including a Mylene Sheath showcase with labelmates Gifts From Enola and If These Trees Could Talk. The record received almost unanimously favorable reviews and catapulted the band into the higher echelons of doom metal groups. Future As of May 2011, Beneath Oblivion has recorded their forthcoming 2xLP titled 'From Man to Dust,' and mastered it with legendary producer/engineer Billy Anderson. The record due for release sometime in August 2011 again on the Mylene Sheath. Like most releases through the Mylene Sheath, fans can expect elaborate packaging/finish and different colors of vinyl on a gatefold as well as CD and digital release. It is also anticipated that the record label will re-release 'Existence Without Purpose' sometime in the future but this is unconfirmed.

They claim the main influences on their music are 'struggle, depression, life, death, isolation, inner and outer turmoil'. Press 'Beneath Oblivion is Cincinnati, Ohio‚Äôs finest in doom, despair and futility. Crawling forward, white-knuckled with down-tuned guitar riffs that leave you unnerved and anxious, bass lines that thud hard enough to leave you nauseous, and drums that thump one minute in a tribal, trance- inducing cavalcade and the next crashing down with the power of a mountain splitting in two. And though self-lamenting enough to satisfy anyones deepest wallowing, it challenges you to use your sorrow as a fuel to conquer and persevere.'

The lowest point (3,605 m) on the ridge is named N√∂rdliches Eigerjoch while another pass (3,747 m) located closer to the M√∂nch is named S√ºdliches Eigerjoch. The Eiger does not lie in the ridge of the Bernese Alps which divides the basins of the Rhone and the Aar, but forms a promontory extending north-east from the M√∂nch, and is connected with it by a long and high ar√™te, in which jagged teeth of rock project through a coating of ice. At the southern end, where this arete abuts against the shoulder of the M√∂nch, it overlooks the gently-sloping plateau which forms the summit of the M√∂nchsjoch, and the descent on the side of the Aletsch Glacier presents no serious difficulty.John Ball, The Alpine guide, Central Alps, p. 108, 1866, London First crossing The first crossing was made by Leslie Stephen and W. and G. S. Mathews, with Ulrich Lauener of Lauterbrunnen and J. B. Croz and M. Charlet of Chamonix. In August 1859, the three enterprising mountaineers above named, failing to perceive any route by which the Jungfraujoch could be attacked with a fair prospect of success, resolved to attempt to pass from the Wengern Alp by the north and east sides of the peak of the M√∂nch. Starting at 4 a.m. they soon reached the Eiger Glacier, and ascended for some distance along the side nearest to the Eiger. On reaching the very much crevassed middle region of the glacier, some time was lost in the endeavour to force a direct way. The correct course was to cross to the southern bank below the rocks of the M√∂nch. After a short ascent the form of the crevasses made it expedient to cross back to the opposite side, nearly to the edge of the glacier, here held up by the great rocky buttress of the Eiger, so remarkable from the Wengern Alp. Further progress seemed to be barred by the menacing condition of the seracs; but the difficulties could be avoided by crossing the glacier diagonally a third time to a sort of snow valley, where the crevasses were apparently filled up by avalanches from the M√∂nch. By this circuitous but not very difficult route the party reached the uppermost plateau of the glacier, lying immediately below the ridge connecting the two peaks. On the side nearest the Monch the ridge was accessible only by extremely long and steep slopes of hard snow. At the end approaching the Eiger the ridge is far easier of access, and this therefore was the first object of attack. On gaining the summit the travellers found themselves at the top of a tremendous precipice overlooking one arm of the Lower Grindelwald Glacier, while the ar√™te to the right connecting them with the M√∂nch was broken through by so many jagged teeth of rock, and at the same time so narrow and difficult, that many hours would probably have been consumed in passing along it. It was therefore thought expedient to return, and to attempt the ascent by the ice-slope, as it should be called since the n√©v√© is so hard and slippery as to make stepcutting very laborious. Ulrich Lauener on that occasion displayed extraordinary strength and endurance, having in 5 hours of uninterrupted work cut 580 steps on an ice slope of from 50 to 52¬∞ inclination. That effort sufficed only to enable the party to gain a patch of rock some way below the summit of the ridge, and more than an hour more was expended in reaching the desired goal. Turning to the right along the ar√™te, they finally reached at 6 p.m. the point on the shoulder of the M√∂nch which forms the summit level of this pass, which was probably the S√ºdliches Eigerjoch. In descending to the Aletsch Glacier the discoverers of this pass were benighted before they could reach the comparative shelter of the Kaulberg cave, and were forced to pass the night on some exposed rocks at the southern base of the Trugberg, where their position in case of bad weather would have been very critical. The Eggishorn was reached on the following morning about 9 a.m. in about 29 hours trom the Wengern Alp.

National Football League Lombardi began his NFL career in 1984 as an area scout under Bill Walsh of the San Francisco 49ers, where he stayed until 1987. Lombardi joined the Cleveland Browns organization as Pro Personnel Director in 1987. Later, he became the Browns' Director of Player Personnel and worked under head coach Bill Belichick managing drafts, negotiating contracts and acquiring free agents. In 1997, Philadelphia Eagles President Joe Banner hired Lombardi as a consultant to assist with the 1997 NFL Draft. Banner then named Lombardi Director of Pro Personnel of the Eagles in 1998. Later that same year, Al Davis hired Lombardi to serve as Senior Personnel Executive of the Oakland Raiders, a position which he held until 2007. During his tenure with the Raiders, Oakland won three consecutive AFC West titles and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVII. In October 2012, sportswriter Jason La Canfora reported that the Cleveland Browns were considering Lombardi for their vacancy at General Manager. He was hired for that position five months later. On February 11, 2014, the Browns replaced Lombardi with Ray Farmer.

Pre- Corporation ownership Various Nottingham townsmen collaborated to get a bill passed in parliament on 8 May 1818 to establish the Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company.Parliamentary Papers, House of Commons and Command, Volume 44. H.M. Stationery Office, 1847 Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company Basford Gas Works. The first works was erected at Butchers Close beside the Nottingham Canal. The plant was probably designed by Thomas Livesey. On 14 April 1819, streets in the city were lit by gas for the first time. Ten gas lamps only were lit, one at the top of Hollowstone, one at the top of Drury Hill, five in Bridlesmith Gate and three in front of the Exchange. Crowds flocked to witness the miracle of a flame burning without a wick but these crowds were terrified lest the pipes conveying the gas to the burners should explode and blow them up.J. Holland Walker, An itinerary of Nottingham, 1935. Increased demand led to a second holder at Butchers Close in the early 1820s and by 1835 this had increased to five. The Nottingham Gas Act 1842 extended the limits of supply to include Sneinton, Radford, Lenton and Basford. The company expanded over the next 30 years under the capable leadership of managing engineer Thomas Hawksley. There were new works built at Radford (1844) and Basford (ca.1854). On 7 November 1853 a specially convened meeting of the Town Council appointed a committee to look into taking over the supply of gas. The committee reported to back on 3 January 1854. It was of the opinion that under existing circumstances no adequate advantage would be gained by the Council taking upon itself the risk of the Gas supply. By 1861, gas was being delivered from Nottingham as far as Beeston. The Nottingham Gas Act 1864 further extended the limits of supply and allowed for the purchase of Samuel John Barber‚Äôs works at Eastcroft, Nottingham. More capital was raised through the Nottingham Gas Act 1873. The Nottingham Corporation Gas Act 1874 transferred the company to local authority control at a meeting on 1 May 1874 when a meeting of shareholders at the George Hotel approved the transfer of ownership. The accepted offer was a payment of ¬£75 for each ¬£50 share. The Nottingham Corporation Gas Office was based on George Street, adjoining the George Hotel.J. Potter Briscoe, Allen‚Äôs Illustrated Guide to Nottingham, 1888. By 1914, seven million cubic feet of gas was made daily from 700 tons of coal Robert Mellors, Old Nottingham suburbs: then and now, 1914. There was an unstable period due to mismanagement during the early years of the twentieth century, but sales revived in the 1930s. By 1936 Radford had become a reserve station. On Nationalisation in 1949 they became part of the Nottingham sub- division of the Nottingham and Derby division of the East Midlands Gas Board, and then British Gas Corporation in 1972.

A loyal retainer hires the player characters to find the missing prince, who is held by agents of the usurper. They are charged with bringing him back to claim the throne.The module includes descriptions of a citadel, a castle, an abbey and an inn. King Halfred of Dunador has died in a mysterious accident. As the heir has disappeared, the wicked Lord Edrin intends to seize the throne. Hollend, head of the Royal Council, asks the player characters to seek out the missing Prince.

In 1998 the module was re-released for 2nd Edition AD&D.; Reception Graham Staplehurst reviewed Destiny of Kings for White Dwarf #80, calling it \\"a well-planned adventure for a medium- sized, low-level AD&D; party‚Äù. He considered the adventure particularly appropriate for an inexperienced or novice party, as very experienced players \\"may find it a little sparse on the intrigue and cloak-and-dagger side\\". Staplehurst found a few bugs in the text, although he felt the module was well introduced, with useful aids such as a glossary of names and places and a plot synopsis. He felt that the random encounters were overpowered, and noted a walled town of \\"ludicrous design, containing a jousting field just 130' long\\". He concluded the review by describing the module as, \\"Overall, a well-thought out adventure that shouldn't be too hard to slot into an existing campaign, and would make a very good introduction for new players.\\" References Category:Dungeons & Dragons modules ","title":"Destiny of Kings"},{"id":"26161329","text":"Marco Ferrari (born 21 August 1966 in Rimini) is a retired Italian professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

A sports analyst typically works for a media company that follows sports and their historical and current events and statistics. Such media companies include ESPN, CBS, TNT, and ABC. A sports analyst may perform different jobs within the field and may even hold more than one position at once. A sports journalist reports to the public in the form of writing and includes information about sporting topics, events, and competitions. A sports commentator and sportscaster give play by play details of a specific sporting event and game. They also relay information necessary in order to understand the context of that specific sport. Sports commentator examples include Joe Buck, Brent Musburger, and Max Kellerman. Sports analysts are typically former athletes and coaches from their respective sports. There are times where a sports analyst will cover a sport even though they have not played that sport previously. An example is Brad Daugherty, who played professional basketball but covers NASCAR Racing. A sports analyst's education may include a Bachelor of Science in Journalism, Sports Communication, and a Master's programs with concentrations in sports reporting. Common courses include News reporting, media ethics, sports psychology and magazine writing. The number of sports analyst jobs is predicted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to decrease by 9% between 2014 and 2024.

The only member of the gens to attain any prominence in the Roman state was Sextus Pompilius, who was tribune of the plebs in 420 BC; however, persons by this name are occasionally found throughout the history of the Republic.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 492 (\\"Pompilia Gens\\"). Origin The first and most illustrious of the Pompilii at Rome was Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome. By all accounts, Pompilius was a Sabine, renowned for his wisdom, and living at the town of Cures at the time of the death of Romulus. The tradition reported by the Roman historians is that the selection of a foreigner over one of the leading Roman citizens was urged by Rome's considerable Sabine populace, which had not only enjoyed equal status with the Latin inhabitants of Rome, but had their own king, Titus Tatius, ruling alongside Romulus for part of his reign. Tatius had been killed in a riot some years earlier, and the Sabines at Rome were eager to be governed by one of their kindred once more.Livy, i. 10-14, 17-21.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 1212, 1213 (\\"Numa Pompilius\\"). A common practice in the later Republic was for gentes to claim descent from figures associated with the founding of Rome, the companions of Aeneas, or individuals who lived in the time of the kings. At least five prominent gentes claimed descent from Numa Pompilius, but if the Pompilii themselves did so, that tradition has not survived.Livy, i. 20.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Numa\\", 21.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 30, 168, 582 (\\"Aemilia Gens\\", \\"Ancus Marcius\\", \\"Calpurnia Gens\\"), vol. II, p. 940 (\\"Marcia Gens\\"), vol. III, pp. 366, 367, 492, 493 (\\"Pinaria Gens\\", \\"Pompilia Gens\\", \\"Pomponia Gens\\").Grueber, Coins of the Roman Republic, ii. p. 311, no. 733; p. 361, no. 62. The nomen Pompilius is a patronymic surname, based on the Sabine praenomen Pompo, the Oscan cognate of the Latin praenomen Quintus, meaning \\"fifth\\". The Latin equivalent of Pompilius was therefore Quinctilius, and in fact there was a family of that name at Rome. Tradition states that Numa's father was named Pompo, and that he had a son by that name as well, which seems to confirm the etymology. The Pomponii claimed descent from this son, and both their nomen and that of Pompeius are occasionally confounded with Pompilius in the ancient writers.Grant, Roman Myths, pp. 123, 139.

An orphan from the 25th century, she was a companion of the First Doctor and a regular in the programme in Seasons 2 and 3 in 1965. Her last name was never revealed during the series. Vicki appeared in 9 stories (38 episodes). Appearances Vicki first appears in the serial The Rescue (1965), a survivor of a spaceship crash on the planet Dido. She and fellow survivor Bennett are being menaced by the monstrous Koquillion when she meets the Doctor (William Hartnell) and his companions Ian (William Russell) and Barbara (Jacqueline Hill). They discover that Koquillion is actually Bennett, who had killed the crew of the spaceship, including Vicki's father. Still coping with his recent parting from his granddaughter Susan at the end of The Dalek Invasion of Earth, the Doctor invites the teenage girl to join the TARDIS crew. Vicki is the one who persuades the Doctor to let Ian and Barbara use a Dalek time machine to return to their own time in The Chase. At the beginning of The Time Meddler, it is revealed that the refugee Steven Taylor (Peter Purves) had stowed away on the TARDIS at the end of The Chase, and he accompanies Vicki and the Doctor. Vicki eventually falls in love with the warrior Troilus when the TARDIS lands during the siege of Troy (The Myth Makers). After making sure that Steven and the Doctor will be all right without her, she decides to remain with Troilus, eventually passing into legend as Cressida, the name given to her by King Priam. She ensures that the Trojan girl Katarina (Adrienne Hill) enters the TARDIS in her place. Other media Vicki appears in several spin-off short stories in the BBC Short Trips range. In \\"Apocrypha Bipedium\\" by Ian Potter, the Eighth Doctor - having convinced her that he is a later Doctor rather than a younger one as Vicki first believed due to her ignorance of Regeneration - advises her and Troilus to move to Cornwall to avoid the tragic conclusion to their story as related by William Shakespeare. The Big Finish audio story Frostfire (2007) is told by an older Vicki living in Carthage, where she and Troilus traveled with Aeneas, had children and settled, although it is shown that she now regrets her decision to stay in Troy. Frostfire portrays Vicki as somewhat lonely and isolated, conversing with a somewhat malevolent living cinder (a spark of the phoenix) because it is the only being with whom she can discuss her travels with the Doctor. Vicki also appears in The Suffering (2010) alongside Steven and The Rocket Men (2011) alongside Ian and Barbara. She also featured in the release titled The Dark Planet, which is an adaptation of an unmade story submitted for season two. Maureen O'Brien provided narration for these stories, aside from The Rocket Men, which was read by Russell. Vicki also appears with Steven and the Fifth Doctor in the audio The Secret History, when the Fifth Doctor swaps places with the First before a crucial adventure as part of a complex plan by the Monk. Vicki appears in two First Doctor novels of the Virgin Missing Adventures range: The Plotters by Gareth Roberts (1996) alongside Ian and Barbara, and The Empire of Glass by Andy Lane (1995) alongside Steven and Irving Braxiatel. She appears with Ian and Barbara in the Past Doctor Adventures novels Byzantium! by Keith Topping (2001) and The Eleventh Tiger by David A. McIntee (2004). The latter states that her full name is Vicki Pallister. Development Vicki was the replacement for the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan (Carole Ann Ford), who was the first companion to leave Doctor Who; Ford was displeased with the lack of her character's development. In contrast to Susan, Vicki was conceived as an Earth orphan from the future; the production team considered many names from here, some of them odd like \\"Luckky\\" and \\"Tanni\\". Maureen O'Brien had just come out of drama school when she was cast; it was her first television acting job. Doctor Who creator Sydney Newman told O'Brien that they were considering having her cut her hair and dye it black. O'Brien refused, saying, \\"Why don't you just get Carole Ann Ford back?\\" Reception Reviewing The Time Meddler, Christopher Bahn of The A.V. Club wrote that Vicki was \\"more than just a replacement of Susan but an improvement on her\\", due to O'Brien being a \\"much more engaging and lively actress\\". Bahn also felt that Vicki was a \\"more effective conversational foil\\" to Steven than Susan would have been. Radio Times reviewer Mark Braxton praised the way Vicki takes control in The Space Museum, comparing her to later companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen). Despite this, Braxton felt that the character was \\"badly underused\\", though he wrote positively of how her departure was handled, and Braxton's colleague Patrick Mulkern wrote that Vicki showed \\"promise\\" in her first story but was \\"short-changed by subsequent writers\\".

In 1788 the third Richard Wynne, then lord of the manor, was in financial difficulties and sold off the estate to Sir Gilbert Heathcote, whose great-grandfather, the first baronet, was a member of Parliament, Lord Mayor of London and governor of the Bank of England. When Sir Gilbert acquired the estate he wanted to transform Folkingham into a small market town.

Compared to Illusion's previous games, the main story is shorter, it features an improved 3D engine and is mainly played through mouse control. The game centers on a male character who stalks and rapes a mother and her two daughters. Three years after its initial release, the game garnered international attention and controversy for its content, resulting in it being banned in several countries. Gameplay RapeLay is played from the perspective of a chikan named Masaya Kimura, who stalks and subsequently rapes the Kiry≈´ family (a mother and her two daughters). Plot In story mode, the player rapes three women in the order of Manaka, Y≈´ko, and Aoi. After the player finishes raping all three women, they unlock Free Play mode. 17-year- old Aoi Kiry≈´ catches Masaya Kimura groping a woman on a subway train, leading to his arrest by the authorities. The next morning, Aoi and her 12-year-old sister Manaka help their mother, Y≈´ko, find a wallet she lost around their home while talking about Aoi's incident the previous day. Unknown to them, Kimura secretly eavesdrops on their conversation while waiting outside their house. It is revealed here that his father, a well-known influential politician, managed to release him from custody. When Kimura discovers that Y≈´ko is widowed, he decides to exact revenge, starting with Manaka. After following Manaka to the subway station, he gropes her on a train. Leaving the train at the next stop, he traps Manaka in a public bathroom, rapes her and takes photos of her naked, semen-covered body with his mobile phone. Masaya instructs Manaka to feign sickness and stay in her room the next day. Screenshot of Chikan mode showing the player groping the final victim, Aoi Kiry≈´, on a subway. The following day, Masaya follows Y≈´ko from her house to the subway before fondling her on a train. He then follows her to the city park. As instructed by Masaya, Manaka calls Y≈´ko on her mobile phone, telling her that she is in the bushes at the park. When Y≈´ko walks towards the bushes, Masaya ambushes her, ties her up, and rapes her in the park. He takes photos of her naked, semen-covered body, as he did with Manaka previously, before handing her over to his gang of henchmen, who detain her for him. On the third day, Masaya follows Aoi to the subway and shows her a picture of her tied-up mother. Shocked, she can only follow his orders as he gropes her on a train. After getting off the train, she asks Masaya the reasons for his actions, at which point she recognises him as the same man she reported for molesting a woman earlier. Getting in a vehicle, Masaya and his henchmen take Aoi to a hotel owned by his family. He violently rapes her in a mini-suite room and again photographs her after withdrawing. After Masaya has had his way with Aoi, Y≈´ko and Manaka are taken into the room via a secret door. With all three captured, Masaya reveals his plans to make them his sex slaves. Y≈´ko tries to cover for her daughters and pleads with him to take her instead. He considers this and tells Y≈´ko he might spare her daughters if she can prove her worth. Y≈´ko gives him fellatio while her daughters watch. When Masaya seems pleased at her performance, Y≈´ko thinks she has won her daughters' freedom. However, Masaya reveals that he will never change his mind and that they are all there to stay. Y≈´ko breaks down in the end, Manaka breaks next and finally Aoi as well. The main story ends with an ominous title card stating that as a new day starts, the Kiry≈´ family horror has just begun.  Endings  There are two possible endings. Regardless of the ending achieved, it results in Masaya's death. * Black Ending ‚Äì Masaya impregnates either Manaka or Aoi and decides to keep the child. A few days later, Masaya is at the subway when he falls onto the train tracks and is killed by a moving train. * Red Ending ‚Äì If the cowgirl position is used with Aoi before she breaks, the game will show a cutscene of Aoi brandishing a knife and stabbing Masaya many times while hysterically laughing. The scene goes black and Aoi's voice is heard. The game ends with Aoi being questioned by the police for Masaya's murder. Characters * ‚Äì The main character. The son of an influential politician, Masaya becomes a chikan who stalks and subsequently rapes the Kiry≈´ family after his release from prison. He lacks a voice actor, instead communicating exclusively through text before and after rape game sessions. * ‚Äì the younger Kiry≈´ sister at 12 years old. She has short black hair and wears a blue dress. The player can give her cat ears, which make her meow. Voiced by Natsumi Yanase (credited as \\"Izumi Maki\\"). * ‚Äì the older Kiry≈´ sister at 17 years old. She has long brunette hair and wears a school uniform. The player may choose to have her hair in a ponytail (default setting) or down and free-flowing. Voiced by Mao Enokizu. * ‚Äì the widowed mother of the two sisters. Y≈´ko is a 42-year-old woman with short brown hair who wears a green top and a beige skirt. Y≈´ko also has the largest breasts and the player can give her glasses to make her produce virgin/geek sound effects. Voiced by Akari Tomiyama (credited as \\"Kaori\\"). Controversy Critics of violent imagery in video games, such as British Member of Parliament Keith Vaz, have cited games involving rape as an example of why video game content needs to be more strictly regulated. RapeLay in particular had come to Vaz's attention in 2009, three years after its initial release, as it was sold on Amazon.com, despite not being officially distributed nor supported outside of Japan, and he vowed to bring the issue into the British Parliament to prevent the game from being sold. Amazon subsequently removed the game from its website. Equality Now urged activists to write to Illusion and then-Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso in protest, arguing the game breaches Japan's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. () In May 2009, these actions culminated in the restriction of the sale and production of RapeLay by the Ethics Organization of Computer Software (EOCS), an independent Japanese ratings organization for adult games, making it impossible to purchase the game even in Japan. The distribution of RapeLay has been banned in Australia due to a campaign run by Women's Forum Australia, under the directorship of Melinda Tankard Reist.Tankard Reist, Melinda, 2009. Getting Real: Challenging the Sexualisation of Girls, p27. RapeLay is also the only video game to be effectively banned in Argentina. Citing RapeLay as an example, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, in his concurring opinion vis-√†-vis the case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association wrote, \\"It...appears that there is no antisocial theme too base for some in the video-game industry to exploit.\\"Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association (2011) Articles in defence have also been written, many noting that rape is considered a lesser crime than murder, yet there are thousands of legal video games in which the goal is to kill enemies. Illusion's response to the controversy was one of bewilderment and a reiteration that the game passed Japanese laws and is not sold outside Japan. Illusion later removed references to the game from their website and ceased distribution of the game, citing concerns over the impact on the industry. As an immediate aftermath, several eroge publishers and studios began to ban foreigners from their official websites. Companies like Minori, Navel and VisualArts banned foreign IPs and chastised foreigners to move to Japan to play their games.

The chief scientist at SRI International, Dr. Hasan Bahcivan, led his team at SRI to develop the payload while the chief engineer, Dr. James Cutler, led a team of students to develop the satellite bus in the Michigan Exploration Laboratory. There are currently two satellites in the RAX mission. The RAX-1 mission, launched in November 2010, was a demonstration of the team's technological capabilities ‚Äì it made great strides in CubeSat design, and was able to execute bistatic radar measurements that had never before been performed on a satellite of its size.RAX-1 Mission Completed RAX-2 builds on this heritage by completing the scientific portion of the overall mission; it is a reflection of students learning from practical experience, and swiftly implementing new, more inventive technologies firsthand. RAX team members were able to get practical spacecraft troubleshooting experience, and applied lessons learned from RAX-1 to RAX-2, which performs the same mission concept with improved bus performance and additional operational modes. RAX-2 launched on October 28, 2011 as part of the NASA ELaNa-3 mission. Capabilities and mission objectives RAX is capable of carrying out scientific procedures that previously could only be done with large satellites, thanks in part to new enabling technologies. RAX's primary mission objective is to study large plasma formations in the ionosphere, the highest region of our atmosphere. These plasma instabilities can create magnetic field-aligned irregularities (FAI), which are dense plasma clouds known to disrupt communication between Earth and orbiting spacecraft. To study FAI, the RAX satellites utilize a large incoherent scatter radar located in Poker Flat, Alaska (known as PFISR). PFISR transmits powerful radio signals into the plasma instabilities, which then scatter in the FAI and are received by the orbiting RAX spacecraft. The signals are then processed by RAX's onboard computer and transmitted back to Earth for scientific analysis. Earth-based scientists have been unable to study these unique plasma formations from the ground, and RAX will serve as a key transition point between Earth and Space. The goal of the RAX-2 mission is to enhance understanding of FAI formation so that short-term forecast models can be generated. This will aid spacecraft operators with planning their mission operations around periods of expected communication disruption. The RAX-1 mission made great strides in CubeSat design, and was able to execute bistatic radar measurements never before been performed with such a spacecraft. RAX team members applied the lessons learned from RAX-1 to the design of a second flight unit, RAX-2, which will perform the same mission concept of the first RAX that launched in November 2010, with improved bus performance and additional operational modes. Science measurements will be enhanced through interactive experiments with high power ionospheric heaters where FAI will be generated on demand. Testing RAX undergoes the same rigorous testing that its bigger cousins do, to meet many of the same requirements. During testing, RAX was able to successfully upload commands and receive telemetry from a host of sensors. These sensors yielded data including temperature and voltage, GPS position and velocity, spacecraft attitude (for orientation determination),RAX Attitude Determination Presentation, University of Michigan Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering and the general status of all of the RAX subsystems. The ground station software was also tested over radio links, proving that the team will be able to listen and interact with RAX remotely. Over the course of the seventeen-month development, the team also built additional testing facilities to evaluate sensors and prototypes. An in-house Helmholtz Cage was constructed to create and simulate the changes in magnetic fields experienced by the satellite throughout its orbit over time. The cage was designed to characterize the magnetometers and run hardware-in-the-loop testing with RAX. This essentially puts the CubeSat into a virtual orbit, and allows the team to generate appropriate magnetic fields to test RAX's ability to determine how it is oriented. The Helmholtz Cage is also used to evaluate magnetic cleanliness and final integration testing. RAX 1 Mission Launch RAX-1 was sent into orbit on November 19, 2010 by the United States Air Force as a payload manifested on the United States Department of Defense Space Test Program‚Äôs (STP) STP-S26 mission, launched from Kodiak Launch Complex on Kodiak Island in Alaska. The rocket used for this launch was a Minotaur IV rocket developed by Orbital Sciences. Results The scientific payload and the majority of the bus systems performed as expected, including the GPS-based position and time subsystem, attitude determination and control, communications, and on-board processing. Unfortunately, the mission ended prematurely after approximately two months of operation due to a gradual degradation of the solar panels that ultimately resulted in a loss of power. RAX team members applied the lessons learned from RAX-1 to the design of a second flight unit, RAX-2.RAX-2 page at eoPortal (accessed Sept 15 2014) RAX 2 Mission Launch RAX-2 launched on October 28, 2011, as a secondary payload on NASA's NPOESS Preparatory ProjectNASA Goddard Spaceflight Center, NPP web page mission. The CubeSat launch was sponsored by NASA as part of the ElaNA-3 program.Educational Launch of Nanosatellites It launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California on a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket, flying in the 7920-10 configuration. CubeSat separation occurred 98 minutes after launch, and beacons from RAX-2 were heard shortly thereafter.

The RIGA project achieves this by two means. First, through the development of an innovative database of income sources from various developing countries, which is available free of charge to researchers via the project‚Äôs website. Second, by producing studies and publications that use the database to analyze pressing economic and policy issues. Purpose The RIGA Project's purpose is to create an income measure that is comparable within and between countries.Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development BREAD The RIGA Project Logo According to the RIGA Project website,RIGA Project Website the key questions addressed by the RIGA Project include: *What are the relationships between the various Rural Income Generating Activities (RIGAs)? *What types of RIGAs are associated with poverty reduction? *What is the relationship between various Rural Non-Farm activities and agriculture? *What is the link between RIGAs and food security? In order to answer these questions, the RIGA Project developed a standardized income calculation method that is applied only to country surveys that meet strict criteria of data requirements. The definition of income utilized closely adheres to the one set out by the International Labour Organization. The \\"Resolution Concerning Household Income and Expenditure Statistics\\" passed by ILO outlines that household income includes all monetary and in-kind receipts that a household receives, which should include income from wage employment, self-employment, property, own consumption of household goods, and both public and private transfers.ILO Resolution Since agriculture remains the principal activity for rural households, the RIGA Project also considers income generated from on-farm activities, both those sold and consumed by the household.Methodological Note on the Construction of Income AggregatesBiotech Knowledge CenterWorld Bank Research E-Newsletter (May 2009) History The need for standardized income data has arisen from the desire of the development community to understand the economic activities of rural households, especially the rural non-farm activities that have been continually overlooked even as the importance of the rural non-farm economy increases.The Rural Non-Farm Economy Project With this in mind, the RIGA Project was initiated as a collaboration between the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Bank, and American University (Washington, DC).World Bank LSMS Only after consultation on the methodology between the partners, did the analysis and compilation of the data begin in 2005. Since 2005, the RIGA Project has created income aggregates for almost 30 countries, which became available to the public, free of charge, with the launch of the website in April 2009. The work of the Project has continued to expand with the addition of RIGA-L. The RIGA-Labor data provides a more in-depth look into the wage employment element of income generating activities, with analysis possible both at the individual and job level.Methodology for Creating the RIGA-L Database Data The database contains an increasing number of surveys from countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Some of the countries have surveys for multiple years, with some of the multi-year countries (e.g. Indonesia, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Vietnam) including panel datasets.RIGA Project Website Africa Ghana - Ghana Living Standards Survey 1992 Ghana - Ghana Living Standards Survey 1998 Kenya - Integrated Household Budget Survey 2004-2005 Madagascar - Enqu√™te Permanente Aupr√®s Des M√©nages 1993-1994 Madagascar - Enqu√™te Permanente Aupr√®s Des M√©nages 2000-2001 Malawi - Integrated Household Survey II 2004-2005 Nigeria - Living Standards Survey 2003-2004 Asia Bangladesh - Household Income-Expenditure Survey 2000 Indonesia - Family Life Survey- Wave 1 1993 Indonesia - Family Life Survey- Wave 3 2000 Nepal - Living Standards Survey I 1995-1996 Nepal - Living Standards Survey II 2003-2004 Pakistan -Integrated Household Survey 1991 Pakistan -Integrated Household Survey 2001 Vietnam - Living Standards Survey 1992-1993 Vietnam - Living Standards Survey 1997-1998 Vietnam - Living Standards Survey 2002 Eastern Europe and Central Asia Albania - Living Standards Measurement Survey 2002 Albania - Living Standards Measurement Survey 2005 Bulgaria - Integrated Household Survey 1995 Bulgaria - Integrated Household Survey 2001 Tajikistan - Living Standards Survey - 2003 Latin America Ecuador - Estudio de Condiciones de Vida 1995 Ecuador - Estudio de Condiciones de Vida 1998 Guatemala - Encuesta de Condiciones de Vida 2000 Nicaragua - Encuesta Nacional de Hogares Sobre Medici√≥n de Niveles de Vida 1998 Nicaragua - Encuesta Nacional de Hogares Sobre Medici√≥n de Niveles de Vida 2001 Panama - Encuesta de Niveles de Vida 1997 Panama - Encuesta de Niveles de Vida 2003 *Survey list as of March 2010 Publications A Cross Country Comparison of Rural Income Generating Activities January 2010 World Development.

Krauss, Friedrich Salomo et al. Japanisches Geschlechtsleben: Abhandlungen und Erhebungen √ºber das Geschlechtsleben des japanischen Volkes ; folkloristische Studien, Schustek, 1965 Beyond Japan, the term has come to be used to describe a commonly pornographic genre of eroge, manga, and anime which includes characters that show both primary sexual characteristics. In today's language it refers almost exclusively to characters who have an overall feminine body, but have both female and male primary genitalia (although testicles are not always present). The term is also often abbreviated as futa(s), which is also used as a generalized term for the works themselves. Historic origins Stones (with shimenawa) representing d≈çsojin found near Karuizawa, Nagano Japanese folk religion created diverse fantasies related to sexual characteristics. Traditional vocal pieces that date back hundreds of years deliver rough evidence that a change of gender was not ruled out and that the representation of the gender was used to worship deities such as d≈çsojin which sometimes had ambiguous gender, being neither male nor female. Leupp adds that the origins might even reach back to the origins of Buddhism, since the deities would not necessarily have a fixed or determinable gender. Likewise the belief spread that some people could change their gender depending on the lunar phase. The term was coined to describe such beings. It is assumed that traditional clothing, which made it more difficult to distinguish men from women like in other cultures, might have had an influence on this development. To restrict women from accessing prohibited areas and to avoid smuggling by hiding items in the belt bag, guard posts were assigned to perform body checks. In historical records, it can be seen that guards liked to joke about this matter quite frequently, resulting in various stories and even poems. Whether anatomical anomalies, like clitoromegaly or unusual physical development, led to these assumptions remains an open question. Until 1644, when onnagata actors were required to adopt male hairstyles regardless of the gender they were portraying, actors playing characters like female warriors capitalized on the interest in the futanari quality, which was common in both samurai and commoner society. In anime and manga Example illustration of two futanari variants. One with testicles (so called full-package futanari) and one without. Originally the Japanese language referred to any character or real person that possessed masculine and feminine traits as futanari. This changed in the 1990s as drawn futanari characters became more popular in anime and manga. Today, the term commonly refers to fictional (drawn) female or female looking hermaphrodite characters. Futanari is also used as the term for a specific genre within hentai related media (pornographic anime or manga) that depicts such characters. Origins Futanari manga became popular in the 1990s and quickly became a part of the industry, cross-pollinating with multiple genres. Toshiki Yui's Hot Tails has been described as the best known example of the genre in the West. In anime aimed at a broad audience, the gender bender or cross-dressing storylines have always been popular. Popular examples include anime such as Ranma ¬Ω, K√§mpfer, and Futaba-Kun Change! (in which the main character changes from male to female), and I My Me! Strawberry Eggs (which takes on a more cross-dressing theme).. The light novel series and anime series Wagaya no Oinari-sama (\\"Our Home's Fox Deity.\\") features a female fox deity who often appears as a male human.

A train station, railway station, railroad station or depot is a railway facility or area where trains regularly stop to load or unload passengers or freight or both. It generally consists of at least one track-side platform and a station building (depot) providing such ancillary services as ticket sales, waiting rooms and baggage/freight service. If a station is on a single-track line, it often has a passing loop to facilitate traffic movements. Places at which passengers only occasionally board or leave a train, sometimes consisting of a short platform and a waiting shed but sometimes indicated by no more than a sign, are variously referred to as \\"stops\\", \\"flag stops\\", \\"halts\\", or \\"provisional stopping places\\". Stations may be at ground level, underground or elevated. Connections may be available to intersecting rail lines or other transport modes such as buses, trams or other rapid transit systems.  Terminology  In British English, traditional usage favours railway station or simply station, even though train station, which is often perceived as an Americanism, is now about as common as railway station in writing; railroad station is not used, railroad being obsolete there. In British usage, the word station is commonly understood to mean a railway station unless otherwise qualified. In American English, the most common term in contemporary usage is train station; railroad station and railway station are less common, though they have been more common in the past. In the United States, the term depot is sometimes used as an alternative name for station, along with the compound forms train depot, railway depot and railroad depot - it is used for both passenger and freight facilities. The term depot is not used in reference to vehicle maintenance facilities in American English where it is the UK, and even neighbouring Canada, for example.  History  The world's first recorded railway station was The Mount on the Oystermouth Railway (later to be known as the Swansea and Mumbles) in Swansea, Wales, which began passenger service in 1807, although the trains were horsedrawn rather than by locomotives. The two-storey Mount Clare station in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, which survives as a museum, first saw passenger service as the terminus of the horse-drawn Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on 22 May 1830. Station with train and coal depot by Gustave Le Gray, (about 1850‚Äì1860s) The oldest terminal station in the world was Crown Street railway station in Liverpool, built in 1830, on the locomotive-hauled Liverpool to Manchester line. The station was slightly older than the still extant Liverpool Road railway station terminal in Manchester. The station was the first to incorporate a train shed. Crown Street station was demolished in 1836, as the Liverpool terminal station moved to Lime Street railway station. Crown Street station was converted to a goods station terminal. The first stations had little in the way of buildings or amenities. The first stations in the modern sense were on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, opened in 1830. Manchester's Liverpool Road Station, the second oldest terminal station in the world, is preserved as part of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. It resembles a row of Georgian houses. Early stations were sometimes built with both passenger and goods facilities, though some railway lines were goods-only or passenger-only, and if a line was dual-purpose there would often be a goods depot apart from the passenger station. Dual-purpose stations can sometimes still be found today, though in many cases goods facilities are restricted to major stations. Many stations date from the 19th century and reflect the grandiose architecture of the time, lending prestige to the city as well as to railway operations. Countries where railways arrived later may still have such architecture, as later stations often imitated 19th-century styles. Various forms of architecture have been used in the construction of stations, from those boasting grand, intricate, Baroque- or Gothic-style edifices, to plainer utilitarian or modernist styles. Stations in Europe tended to follow British designs and were in some countries, like Italy, financed by British railway companies. Stations built more recently often have a similar feel to airports, with a simple, abstract style. Examples of modern stations include those on newer high-speed rail networks, such as the Shinkansen in Japan, THSR in the Republic of China, TGV lines in France and ICE lines in Germany.  Station facilities  Presto contactless smart card reader and self-serve ticket machine at a suburban train station in Toronto Stations usually have staffed ticket sales offices, automated ticket machines, or both, although on some lines tickets are sold on board the trains. Many stations include a shop or convenience store. Larger stations usually have fast-food or restaurant facilities. In some countries, stations may also have a bar or pub. Other station facilities may include: toilets, left-luggage, lost-and-found, departures and arrivals boards, luggage carts, waiting rooms, taxi ranks, bus bays and even car parks. Larger or manned stations tend to have a greater range of facilities including also a station security office. These are usually open for travellers when there is sufficient traffic over a long enough period of time to warrant the cost. In large cities this may mean facilities available around the clock. A basic station might only have platforms, though it may still be distinguished from a halt, a stopping or halting place that may not even have platforms. Many stations, either larger or smaller, offer interchange with local transportation; this can vary from a simple bus stop across the street to underground rapid-transit urban rail stations. In many African, South American, and Asian countries, stations are also used as a place for public markets and other informal businesses. This is especially true on tourist routes or stations near tourist destinations. As well as providing services for passengers and loading facilities for goods, stations can sometimes have locomotive and rolling stock depots (usually with facilities for storing and refuelling rolling stock and carrying out minor repair jobs).  Station configurations  In addition to the basic configuration of a station, various features set certain types of station apart. The first is the level of the tracks. Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a level crossing, the road and railway will be at different levels. The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both. The other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level, is also common, but is perhaps rarer in urban areas, except when the station is a terminus. Elevated stations are more common, not including metro stations. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops, causing road traffic to wait for an extended period of time. Occasionally, a station serves two or more railway lines at differing levels. This may be due to the station's position at a point where two lines cross (example: Berlin Hauptbahnhof), or may be to provide separate station capacity for two types of service, such as intercity and suburban (examples: Paris-Gare de Lyon and Philadelphia's 30th Street Station), or for two different destinations. Stations may also be classified according to the layout of the platforms. Apart from single-track lines, the most basic arrangement is a pair of tracks for the two directions; there is then a basic choice of an island platform between, two separate platforms outside the tracks (side platforms), or a combination of the two. With more tracks, the possibilities expand. Some stations have unusual platform layouts due to space constraints of the station location, or the alignment of the tracks. Examples include staggered platforms, such as at Tutbury and Hatton railway station on the Crewe‚ÄìDerby line, and curved platforms, such as Cheadle Hulme railway station on the Macclesfield to Manchester Line. Triangular stations also exist where two lines form a three-way junction and platforms are built on all three sides, for example and stations.  Tracks  In a station, there are different types of tracks to serve different purposes. A station may also have a passing loop with a loop line that comes off the straight main line and merge back to the main line on the other end by railroad switches to allow trains to pass. A track with a spot at the station to board and disembark trains is called station track or house track regardless of whether it is a main line or loop line. If such track is served by a platform, the track may be called platform track. A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is called passing track. A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called through track. There may be other sidings at the station which are lower speed tracks for other purposes. A maintenance track or a maintenance siding, usually connected to a passing track, is used for parking maintenance equipment, trains not in service, autoracks or sleepers. A refuge track is a dead-end siding that is connected to a station track as a temporary storage of a disabled train.  Terminus  A \\"terminus\\" or \\"terminal\\" is a station at the end of a railway line. Trains arriving there have to end their journeys (terminate) or reverse out of the station. Depending on the layout of the station, this usually permits travellers to reach all the platforms without the need to cross any tracks ‚Äì the public entrance to the station and the main reception facilities being at the far end of the platforms. Sometimes, however, the track continues for a short distance beyond the station, and terminating trains continue forwards after depositing their passengers, before either proceeding to sidings or reversing to the station to pick up departing passengers. Bondi Junction and Kristiansand Station, Norway, are like this. A terminus is frequently, but not always, the final destination of trains arriving at the station. Especially in continental Europe, a city may have a terminus as its main railway station, and all main lines converge on it. In such cases all trains arriving at the terminus must leave in the reverse direction from that of their arrival. There are several ways in which this can be accomplished: * arranging for the service to be provided by a multiple-unit or push-pull train, both of which are capable of operating in either direction; the driver simply walks to the other end of the train and takes control from the other cab; this is increasingly the normal method in Europe; and is very common in North America; * by detaching the locomotive which brought the train into the station and then either ** using another track to \\"run it around\\" to the other end of the train, to which it then re-attaches; ** attaching a second locomotive to the outbound end of the train; or * by the use of a \\"wye\\", a roughly triangular arrangement of track and switches (points) where a train can reverse direction and back into the terminal; * historically, turntables were used to reverse steam engines. There may also be a bypass line, used by freight trains that do not need to stop at the terminus. Some termini have a newer set of through platforms underneath (or above, or alongside) the terminal platforms on the main level. They are used by a cross-city extension of the main line, often for commuter trains, while the terminal platforms may serve long-distance services. Examples of underground through lines include the Thameslink platforms at in London, the Argyle and North Clyde lines of Glasgow's suburban rail network, in Antwerp in Belgium, the RER at the Gare du Nord in Paris, the Milan suburban railway service's Passante railway, and many of the numerous S-Bahn lines at terminal stations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, such as at Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof. An American example of a terminal with this feature is Union Station in Washington, DC, where there are bay platforms on the main concourse level to serve terminating trains and standard island platforms one level below to serve trains continuing southwards. The lower tracks run in a tunnel beneath the concourse and emerge a few blocks away to cross the Potomac River into Virginia. Terminus stations in large cities are by far the biggest stations, with the largest being the Grand Central Terminal in New York City. \\"Termini\\" is the name of Rome's central train station. Other major cities, such as London, Boston, Paris, Istanbul, Tokyo, and Milan have more than one terminus, rather than routes straight through the city. Train journeys through such cities often require alternative transport (metro, bus, taxi or ferry) from one terminus to the other. For instance, in Istanbul transfers from the Sirkeci Terminal (the European terminus) and the Haydarpa≈üa Terminal (the Asian terminus) traditionally required crossing the Bosphorus via alternative means, before the Marmaray railway tunnel linking Europe and Asia was completed. Some cities, including New York, have both termini and through lines. Terminals that have competing rail lines using the station frequently set up a jointly owned terminal railroad to own and operate the station and its associated tracks and switching operations.  Stop  During a journey, the term station stop may be used in announcements, to differentiate a halt during which passengers may alight for another reason, such as a locomotive change. While a junction or interlocking usually divides two or more lines or routes, and thus has remotely or locally operated signals, a station stop does not. A station stop usually does not have any tracks other than the main tracks, and may or may not have switches (points, crossovers).  Halt  A halt, in railway parlance in the Commonwealth of Nations and Republic of Ireland, is a small station, usually unstaffed or with very few staff, and with few or no facilities. In some cases, trains stop only on request, when passengers on the platform indicate that they wish to board, or passengers on the train inform the crew that they wish to alight. The Wishing Well halt at St Keyne, Cornwall. , it was one of three stopping places bearing the name \\"halt\\" in the UK ;United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, most former halts on the national railway networks have had the word halt removed from their names. Historically, in many instances the spelling \\"halte\\" was used, before the spelling \\"halt\\" became commonplace. There are only two publicly advertised and publicly accessible National Rail stations with the word \\"halt\\" remaining: and .GB Rail Timetable Winter Edition 8 December 2013 In addition there are many other such stops in the UK rail network such as in North Wales, in Shropshire, and in Warwickshire, where passengers are requested to inform a member of on- board train staff if they wish to alight, or, if catching a train from the station, to make themselves clearly visible to the driver and use a hand signal as the train approaches. A number of other halts are still open and operational on privately owned, heritage, and preserved railways throughout the British Isles. The word is often used informally to describe national rail network stations with limited service and low usage, such as the Oxfordshire Halts on the Cotswold Line. The title halt had also sometimes been applied colloquially to stations served by public services but not available for use by the general public, being accessible only by persons travelling to/from an associated factory (for example IBM near Greenock and British Steel Redcar‚Äì although neither of these is any longer served by trains), or military base (such as Lympstone Commando) or railway yard. The only two such remaining \\"private\\" stopping places on the national system where the \\"halt\\" designation is still officially used seem to be Staff Halt (at Durnsford Road, Wimbledon) and Battersea Pier Sidings Staff Halt ‚Äì both are solely for railway staff and are not open to passengers. The Great Western Railway in Great Britain began opening haltes on 12 October 1903; from 1905, the French spelling was Anglicised to \\"halt\\". These GWR halts had the most basic facilities, with platforms long enough for just one or two carriages; some had no raised platform at all, necessitating the provision of steps on the carriages. Halts were normally unstaffed, tickets being sold on the train. On 1 September 1904, a larger version, known on the GWR as a \\"platform\\" instead of a \\"halt\\", was introduced; these had longer platforms, and were usually staffed by a senior grade porter, who sold tickets, and sometimes booked parcels or milk consignments. From 1903 to 1947 the GWR built 379 halts and inherited a further 40 from other companies at the Grouping of 1923. Peak building periods were before the First World War (145 built) and 1928‚Äì39 (198 built)). Ten more were opened by BR on ex-GWR lines. The GWR also built 34 \\"platforms\\". ;Other countries In the Republic of Ireland, a few small railway stations are designated as \\"halts\\" (, sing. stad). In some Commonwealth countries the term \\"halt\\" is used. In Australia, with its sparse rural populations, such stopping places are common on lines that are still open for passenger traffic. In the state of Victoria, for example, a location on a railway line where a small diesel railcar or railmotor can stop on request to allow passengers to board or alight is called a rail motor stopping place. It is often designated solely by a sign beside the railway at an access point near a road. The passenger can hail the driver to stop, and can buy a ticket from the train guard or conductor. In South Australia, such places were called \\"provisional stopping places\\".South Australian Railways working timetable 1964, Table 35 They were often placed on routes on which \\"school trains\\" (services conveying children from rural localities to and from school) operated. In rural and remote communities across Canada and the United States, passengers wanting to board the train at such places had to flag the train down to stop it, hence the name \\"flag stops\\" or \\"flag stations\\".  Accessibility  Accessibility for people with disabilities is mandated by law in some countries. Considerations include: elevator or ramp access to all platforms, matching platform height to train floors, making wheelchair lifts available when platforms do not match vehicle floors, accessible toilets and pay phones, audible station announcements, and safety measures such as tactile marking of platform edges.  Goods stations  Park Lane Goods Terminus at Liverpool's docks was the world's first station built entirely for freight. Goods or freight stations deal exclusively or predominantly with the loading and unloading of goods and may well have marshalling yards (classification yards) for the sorting of wagons. The world's first goods terminal was the 1830 Park Lane Goods Station at the South End Liverpool Docks. Built in 1830, the terminal was reached by a tunnel. As goods are increasingly moved by road, many former goods stations, as well as the goods sheds at passenger stations, have closed. In addition, many goods stations today are used purely for the cross-loading of freight and may be known as transshipment stations, where they primarily handle containers. They are also known as container stations or terminals.

Formed in 1882 as \\"Hotspur Football Club\\" by a group of schoolboys, it was renamed to \\"Tottenham Hotspur Football Club\\" in 1884, and is commonly referred to as \\"Tottenham\\" or \\"Spurs\\". Initially amateur, the club turned professional in 1895. Spurs won the FA Cup in 1901, becoming the first, and so far only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League. The club has won the FA Cup a further seven times, the Football League twice, the League Cup four times, the UEFA Cup twice and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1963, the first UEFA competition won by an English team. In 1960‚Äì61, Tottenham became the first team to complete The Double in the 20th century. Tottenham played in the Southern League from 1896 until 1908, when they were elected to the Football League Second Division. They won promotion to the First Division the following year, and stayed there until the late 1920s. The club played mostly in the Second Division until the 1950s, when it enjoyed a revival, reaching a peak in the 1960s. Fortunes dipped after the early 1970s, but resurged in the 1980s. Tottenham was a founding member of the Premier League in 1992; they finished in mid-table most seasons, but now rank as one of the top six clubs. Of the club's thirty-two managers, John Cameron was the first to win a major trophy, the 1901 FA Cup. Peter McWilliam added a second FA Cup win for the club in 1921. Arthur Rowe developed the \\"push and run\\" style of play in the 1950s and led the club to its first league title. Bill Nicholson oversaw the Double winning side as well as the most successful period of the club's history, in the 1960s and early 1970s. Later managers include Keith Burkinshaw, the second most successful in terms of major trophies won, with two FA Cups and a UEFA Cup, and Terry Venables, under whom the club won the FA Cup in 1991. Spurs played their early games on public land at Tottenham Marshes, but by 1888 they were playing on rented ground at Northumberland Park. In 1899, the club moved to White Hart Lane, where a stadium was gradually developed. Spurs remained there until 2017. Its replacement, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, was completed in 2019 on the same site; during its construction, home matches were played at Wembley Stadium. Formation The Hotspur Football Club was formed in 1882 by a group of schoolboys from Saint John's Middle Class School and Tottenham Grammar School. Mostly aged 13 to 14, the boys were members of the Hotspur Cricket Club formed two years earlier. Robert Buckle with his two friends Sam Casey and John Anderson conceived the idea of a football club so they could continue to play sport during the winter months. Club lore states that the boys gathered one night under a lamppost along Tottenham High Road about 100 yards/metres from the now-demolished White Hart Lane ground, and agreed to form a football club. The date of their meeting is unknown, so the Hotspur Football Club is taken to have been formed on 5 September 1882, when the eleven boys had to start paying their first annual subscriptions of sixpence. By the end of the year the club had eighteen members. Although the name Northumberland Rovers was mooted, the boys settled on the name Hotspur. As with the cricket club, it was chosen in honour of Sir Henry Percy (better known as Harry Hotspur, the rebel of Shakespeare's Henry IV, part 1), whose Northumberland family once owned land in the area, including Northumberland Park in Tottenham where the club is located. The boys initially held their meetings under lampposts in Northumberland Park or in half-built houses on the adjoining Willoughby Lane in Tottenham. In August 1883 the boys sought the assistance of John Ripsher, the warden of Tottenham YMCA and Bible-class teacher at All Hallows Church, who became the first president of the club and its treasurer. A few days later he presided over a meeting of twenty-one club members in the basement kitchen of the YMCA at Percy House or its annex on the High Road, which became the club's first headquarters. Ripsher, who continued as president until 1894, supported the boys through the club's formative years, reorganising it and establishing the club's ethos. The stability he provided in the early years helped the club survive, unlike many others of the period that did not. Ripsher found new premises for the club when the boys were evicted in 1884 after a YMCA council member was accidentally hit by a soot-covered football: first at 1 Dorset Villa, a church-owned property on Northumberland Park where they stayed for two years, then to the Red House on High Road around 1885‚Äì86 after they were again asked to leave, this time for playing cards in church. The Red House, which stood beside the entrance gate to White Hart Lane but was demolished in 2016 during the ground's redevelopment, was the club's headquarters until its move to 808 High Road in 1891. It was later bought by the club in 1921 and became its official address (748 Tottenham High Road) in 1935. In April 1884, owing to letters for another London club named Hotspur being misdirected to North London, the club was renamed Tottenham Hotspur Football Club to avoid any further confusion. The team were referred to as \\"Spurs\\" in press reports as early as 1883, and they have also been called \\"the Lilywhites\\" after the white jerseys they have worn since the late 19th century. Early years Spurs' first and second teams in 1885. Club president John Ripsher top row second right, team captain Jack Jull middle row fourth left, Robert Buckle bottom row second left The boys played their early matches on public ground at Tottenham Marshes, where they needed to mark out and prepare their own pitch, and on occasions had to defend against other teams who might try to take it over. Local pubs were used as dressing rooms. Robert Buckle was the team's first captain, and for two years the boys largely played games among themselves, but the number of friendly fixtures against other clubs gradually increased. The first recorded match took place on 30 September 1882 against a local team named the Radicals, a game Hotspur lost 2‚Äì0. The first game reported by the local press was on 6 October 1883 against Brownlow Rovers, which Spurs won 9‚Äì0. The team played their first competitive match on 17 October 1885 against St Albans, a company works team, in the London Football Association Cup. The match was attended by 400 spectators, and Spurs won 5‚Äì2. In the early days Spurs were essentially a schoolboy team, sometimes playing against adults, but older players later joined, and the squad strengthened as they absorbed players from other local clubs. Some of the early members such as Buckle, Sam Casey, John Thompson and Jack Jull stayed with the club for many years as players, committee members or directors; for example Jull played until 1896, while Buckle served in various roles on the club committee and was on the first board of directors of Tottenham formed in 1898 until he left in 1900. Spurs attracted the interest of the local community soon after their formation, and the number of spectators for their matches grew to 4,000 within a few years. As their games were played on public land, no admission fees could be charged for spectators. In 1888 Tottenham moved their home fixtures from the Tottenham Marshes to Northumberland Park, where they rented an enclosed ground and were able to charge for admission and control the crowd. The first match there was on 13 October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. A week later they were beaten 8‚Äì2 by Old Etonians in their first senior game at the ground. Spectators were usually charged 3d a game, raised to 6d for cup ties. By the early 1890s, a cup tie may have drawn a few thousand paying supporters. In the early days there were no stands except for a couple of wagons as seats and wooden trestles for spectators to stand on, but for the 1894‚Äì95 season, the first stand with just over 100 seats and a changing room underneath was built on the ground. The club attempted to join the Southern League in 1892 but failed when it received only one vote. Instead, the club played in the short-lived Southern Alliance for the 1892‚Äì93 season. Spurs initially played in navy-blue shirts with a letter H on a scarlet shield on the left breast and white breeches. The club colours were changed in 1884 or 1885 to light blue and white halved jerseys and white shorts, inspired by watching Blackburn Rovers win the FA Cup at the Kennington Oval in 1884, before returning to the original dark blue shirts for the 1889‚Äì90 season. From 1890 to 1895, the club had red shirts and blue shorts, changed in 1895 to chocolate brown and gold narrow striped shirts and dark-blue shorts. Finally, in the 1898‚Äì99 season, the strip was changed to the now familiar white shirts and navy-blue shorts. Professional status The club became unwittingly involved in a controversy known as the Payne Boots Affair in October 1893. A reserve player from Fulham, Ernie Payne, agreed to play for Spurs but arrived without any kit as it had apparently been stolen at Fulham. As no suitable boots could be found, the club gave him 10 shillings to buy his boots. Fulham then complained to the London Football Association that Tottenham had poached their player, and accused them of professionalism breaching amateur rules. On the latter charge, the London Football Association found Tottenham guilty, as the payment for the boots was judged an \\"unfair inducement\\" to attract the player to the club. Spurs were suspended for a fortnight, had to forfeit their second-round match against Clapham Rovers in the FA Amateur Cup and were therefore eliminated from the competition. Despite the punishment, the controversy had an unexpected positive effect on the club. Press coverage of the incident raised the national profile of what was then a local amateur club, and gained them sympathy for what many thought was unfair treatment. Invitations from other clubs to play games increased, and attendance at their matches rose. The publicity also brought on board local businessman John Oliver, who became chairman in 1894 after Ripsher retired, and provided funding for the club. With an increasing number of teams to play against, the quality of Spurs' opposition also improved. To compete against better teams, the club committee, led by the second club president John Oliver, agreed that the club should turn professional. Robert Buckle made the proposal at a meeting on 16 December 1895, which was accepted after a vote, and the club gained its professional status on 20 December 1895. Spurs made a failed attempt to join the Football League, but they were admitted to Division One of the Southern League in mid-1896. They also participated in other leagues, initially the United League and later Western League, in which they did not always field the full first team. The team was almost entirely rebuilt over the next two years; the first two professional players, Jock Montgomery and J. Logan, were quickly recruited from Scotland, and in 1897 they signed their first international, Jack Jones. On 2 March 1898, Spurs decided to become a limited company‚Äîthe Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company‚Äîto raise funds and to limit the personal liability of its members. Eight thousand shares were issued at ¬£1 each, but only 1,558 were taken up by the public in the first year. A board of directors was formed with Oliver as chairman, but he retired after the company reported a loss of ¬£501 at the end of the season in 1899. Charles Roberts took over as chairman and remained in the post until 1943. Soon after the club became a limited company, on 14 March 1898, Frank Brettell was appointed the first manager of Spurs. He signed several players from northern clubs, including Harry Erentz, Tom Smith and, in particular, John Cameron, who signed from Everton in May 1898 and was to have a considerable impact on the history of the club. Cameron became player-manager the following February after Bretell left to take a better-paid position at Portsmouth, and led the club to its first trophies: the Southern League title in 1899‚Äì1900 and the 1901 FA Cup. In his first year as manager, Cameron signed seven players: George Clawley, Ted Hughes, David Copeland, Tom Morris, Jack Kirwan, Sandy Tait and Tom Pratt. The following year Sandy Brown replaced Pratt, who wanted to return to the North despite being the top goalscorer. They, together with Cameron, Erentz, Smith and Jones, formed the 1901 Cup- winning team. Move to White Hart Lane First game at White Hart Lane, Spurs vs Notts County for the official opening on 4 September 1899 On Good Friday 1898 a match was held against Woolwich Arsenal at Northumberland Park, attended by a record crowd of 14,000. In the overcrowded ground, fans climbed up onto the roof of the refreshment stand to get a better view. The stand collapsed under their weight causing a few injuries, which prompted the club to start looking for a new ground. In 1899 the club moved a short distance to a piece of land behind the White Hart pub. The White Hart Lane site, actually located behind Tottenham High Road, was a nursery owned by the brewery chain Charringtons. The club initially leased the ground from Charringtons, but development of the ground was restricted by the terms of the lease. In 1905, after issuing shares towards the cost of purchase, Spurs bought the freehold for ¬£8,900 and paid a further ¬£2,600 for a piece of land at the northern end. By then the ground had a covered stand on the west side and earth mounds on the other three sides. The ground was never officially named, but it became popularly known as White Hart Lane, also the name of a local thoroughfare. The first game at White Hart Lane was a friendly against Notts County on 4 September 1899 that Spurs won 4‚Äì1, and the first competitive game on the ground was held five days later against Queens Park Rangers, a game won by Spurs 1‚Äì0. With an effective attacking triangle of Jones, Kirwan and Copeland, Tottenham won 11 games in their first 13 games in the 1908‚Äì09 season. On 28 April 1900, they finished top of the Southern League, and won the club's first trophy. After the win, the club was dubbed \\"Flower of the South\\" by the press. 1901 FA Cup Tottenham first took part in the FA Cup in the 1894‚Äì95 season, but never got beyond the third round proper in six years. In the 1901 FA Cup, Spurs managed to reach the final after beating Preston North End, Bury, Reading and West Bromwich Albion; all apart from Reading were Football League Division One teams of the 1900‚Äì01 season. The final against Division One Sheffield United was played at Crystal Palace and attended by 110,820 spectators, at that time the largest crowd ever for a football match. The game ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw, with both of Spurs' goals coming from Sandy Brown, and a disputed goal from Sheffield. The final was the first to be filmed, and it contained the first referee decision demonstrated by film footage to be incorrect, as it showed that the ball did not cross the line for the Sheffield goal. The squad for the 1901 FA Cup Final against Sheffield United In the replay at Burnden Park, Bolton on 27 April 1901, Spurs won 3‚Äì1 with goals from Cameron, Smith and another by Brown. By winning the FA Cup, Spurs became the only non-League club to have achieved the feat since the formation of the Football League in 1888. The club also inadvertently introduced the tradition of tying ribbons in the colours of the winning team on the FA Cup when the wife of a Spurs director tied blue and white ribbons to the handles of the cup. The win started a trend for Spurs' success in years ending in a one, with further FA Cup wins in 1921, 1961, 1981 and 1991, the League Cup in 1971, the league in 1951, and in 1961, which is the double winning year. Following the 1901 Cup win, Spurs failed to repeat the success in the next few seasons but they were runners-up in the Southern League twice, and won the London League in the 1902‚Äì03 season as well as the Western League in the 1903‚Äì04 season. They went on their first overseas tour, to Austria and Hungary, in May 1905. Cameron left on 13 March 1907, citing \\"differences with the directorate\\", and he was replaced in April 1907 by Fred Kirkham, a referee with no managerial experience. Kirkham was disliked by players and fans alike, and he left on 20 July 1908 after a year as manager. Early decades in the Football League (1908‚Äì1949) Chart of Tottenham's table positions since joining the Football League.  Election to the Football League  Tottenham resigned from the Southern League in 1908 and sought to join the Football League. Their initial application was unsuccessful, but after the resignation of Stoke from the league for financial reasons, Tottenham won election to the Second Division of the Football League for the 1908‚Äì09 season to replace them. As Spurs had no manager following Kirkham's departure, the directors took on the role of choosing the team, while the club secretary Arthur Turner was tasked with overseeing the team's affairs. Spurs played their first league game in September 1908 against Wolverhampton Wanderers and won 3‚Äì0, with their first ever goal in the Football League scored by Vivian Woodward. Woodward was also instrumental in the club's immediate promotion to the First Division after finishing runners-up in their first year. Before the start of the following season, Woodward left football to pursue other interests, although he soon returned to the game and joined Chelsea. Spurs struggled in their first year in the First Division, but avoided relegation by beating Chelsea in the last game of the season with goals from Billy Minter and a former Chelsea player Percy Humphreys, sending their opponents down instead. Spurs cockerel in a 1910 official programme The club started an ambitious plan to redevelop White Hart Lane in 1909, beginning with the construction of the West Stand designed by Archibald Leitch. The North and South stands were then built in the early 1920s, with the East Stand completed in 1934, bringing the capacity of the finished stadium to almost 80,000. A bronze cockerel was placed on top of the West Stand in 1909. The cockerel was adopted as an emblem because Harry Hotspur, after whom the club was named, was believed to have gained the nickname wearing fighting spurs in battles, and spurs were also worn by fighting cock. Tottenham had initially used spurs as a symbol in 1900, as Harry Hotspur was said to have charged into battles by digging in his spurs to make the horse go faster, a symbol that evolved into a fighting cock. In April 1912 Jimmy Cantrell, Bert Bliss and Arthur Grimsdell arrived at the club. Late that year Peter McWilliam was appointed manager. He became a significant and popular figure at the club, managing the team in two separate periods, both interrupted by world wars. The first significant signing by McWilliam was winger Fanny Walden, who was signed for a record ¬£1,700 in April 1913, later signings included goalkeeper Bill Jaques and right-back Tommy Clay. McWilliam's record in the early years was poor, and Tottenham were bottom of the league at the end of the 1914‚Äì15 season when league football was suspended owing to the First World War that had started a year earlier. During the war years, White Hart Lane was taken over by the government and turned into a factory for making gas masks, gunnery and protection equipment. The London clubs organised their own matches, and Tottenham played their home games at Arsenal's Highbury and Clapton Orient's Homerton grounds. When football resumed in 1919, the First Division was expanded from 20 to 22 teams. The Football League offered one of the additional places to 19th-placed Chelsea, who would otherwise have been relegated with Spurs for the 1915‚Äì16 season, and the other, controversially, to Arsenal, who had finished only sixth in Division Two the previous season. This decision cemented a bitter rivalry that continues to this day, a rivalry that had begun six years earlier when Arsenal relocated from Plumstead to Highbury, a move opposed by Tottenham, who considered Highbury their territory, as well as by Clapton Orient and Chelsea. Matches between the two clubs, called the North London derby, became the most fiercely-contested derby in London. Interwar years Tottenham Hotspur captain Arthur Grimsdell displays the cup to fans on Tottenham High Road after Spurs' victory in the 1921 final, the first win by a London-based team in 20 years. In the first season after the war McWilliam took Tottenham straight back to Division One when they became Division Two Champions of the 1919‚Äì20 season. They won with what was then a league record of 70 points, losing only 4 games all season with 102 goals scored. Two players signed that season, Jimmy Dimmock and Jimmy Seed, became crucial members of the team together with Grimsdell. Other notable players of the period include Tommy Clay, Bert Smith and Charlie Walters. The following year Spurs reached their second FA Cup Final after beating Preston North End in the semi-final with two goals from Bliss. On 23 April 1921, in a game dominated by Walters, Spurs beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 1‚Äì0 in the final at Stamford Bridge, with 20-year-old Dimmock scoring the winning goal. They also won their first Charity Shield the same year. Following their FA Cup victory in 1921, Spurs players started to wear the cockerel emblem on their shirts. At McWilliam's instigation a nursery club was established at Northfleet in about 1922, an arrangement that was formalised in 1931 and lasted until the Second World War. Thirty-seven Spurs players, nine of whom became internationals, started their playing career at Northfleet. They include Bill Nicholson, Ron Burgess, Taffy O'Callaghan, Vic Buckingham and Ted Ditchburn. In the 1921‚Äì22 season, Spurs finished second to Liverpool in the league, their first serious challenge for the title. After the success of the two post-war seasons, Spurs only managed to finish mid- table in the next five. The team had begun to deteriorate, and new signings Jack Elkes and Frank Osborne could not overcome weaknesses in other positions. They were in first place for a while in 1925, until Grimsdell broke his leg and they dropped down the table. McWilliam left for Middlesbrough in February 1927 when Middlesbrough offered him significantly better pay while the Tottenham board refused his request for a smaller increase. Billy Minter, who first joined the club as a player in 1907 and became the first player to score 100 goals for the club in 1919, took over as manager. In the 1927‚Äì28 season, his first full season in charge, Spurs were unexpectedly relegated despite finishing with 38 points, only 6 points behind 4th-placed Derby County. One factor in their relegation may have been the sale of Jimmy Seed to Sheffield Wednesday‚ÄîWednesday had looked certain to be relegated, but Seed helped them escape, beating Tottenham twice along the way, and they went on to win the League Championship title in each of the next two seasons. Minter struggled to return Spurs to the top flight despite signing Ted Harper in February 1929. Harper was a prolific goalscorer in the few years he was at the club; his 36 league goals scored in a season in 1930‚Äì31 remained a record until 1963 when it was broken by Jimmy Greaves. The stress of being manager affected Minter's health; he resigned, and was given another position at the club in November 1929. Percy Smith was appointed manager at the start of 1930, and he strengthened the team with imported and home-grown talents including George Hunt, Willie Hall and Arthur Rowe. The team, aided by the goal-scoring exploits of Hunt, were nicknamed the \\"Greyhounds\\" in the 1932‚Äì33 season as they raced up the Second Division from near the bottom of the table, and won promotion after finishing second to Stoke City. Spurs only managed to stay in Division One for two seasons; injuries (especially to Rowe and Hall) left the team weakened and at the bottom of the table in the 1934‚Äì35 season by April 1935. Smith then resigned, claiming that the club's directors had interfered with his team selection. Jack Tresadern took over from caretaker manager Wally Hardinge in July 1935, but failed to lift the club out of the Second Division in the three years of his tenure. He promoted centre-forward Johnny Morrison in place of fans' favourite George Hunt, and decided to sell Hunt to rival Arsenal in 1937, a decision that made him unpopular. He left in April 1938 for Plymouth Argyle when it became apparent that he would likely be sacked at the end of the season. Peter McWilliam was brought back as manager, and he tried to rebuild the team by promoting young players from Northfleet including Nicholson, Burgess and Ditchburn, but his second stint at the club was again interrupted by world war. Spurs also failed to advance beyond the quarter- finals of the FA Cup in the 1930s, getting that far three years running from 1935 to 1938. Despite Tottenham's lack of success in this period, 75,038 spectators still squeezed into White Hart Lane in March 1938 for a cup tie against Sunderland‚Äîthe club's largest gate until it was surpassed in 2016 when more than 85,000 attended the 2016‚Äì17 UEFA Champions League home match against Monaco held at Wembley Stadium. War and post-war lull On 3 September 1939 Neville Chamberlain declared war, and league football was abandoned with only three games played. Nevertheless, matches continued to be arranged and played during the Second World War. The London clubs first played in the Wartime League and Football League War Cup, and Spurs won the Regional League South 'C' in 1940. After a reorganisation in 1941, they also competed in the Football League South. Owing to the difficult wartime conditions, Spurs along with other London clubs refused to travel long distances for the matches drawn up by the Football League and decided to run their own competitions: London War League and London War Cup. They (eleven London clubs and five other clubs from the south) were temporarily expelled from the Football League; after paying a ¬£10 fine they were readmitted, but they played in the Football League South in the way the London clubs had suggested. McWilliam went back to the North during the war and the team was managed by Arthur Turner; under him Spurs won the regional league twice. Charles Robert who had been chairman since 1898 died in 1943, and he was replaced by Fred Bearman. As it was difficult to field a full squad in the war years, many young players, among them Sonny Walters, Les Medley, Les Bennett and Arthur Willis, gained their first playing experience for the club in this period. Spurs also shared White Hart Lane with Arsenal when Highbury was requisitioned by the government and used as an Air Raid Precautions centre. After the war ended, McWilliam decided that he was too old to return to the club, and a former Arsenal player Joe Hulme was given the job of managing Tottenham. Hulme failed to win promotion for the club, although Spurs managed to stay in the top half of the Second Division for the three seasons he was manager, and they reached the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1948. Players who joined the squad under Hulme include Eddie Baily, Len Duquemin, Harry Clarke and Charlie Withers. Football was popular in the post-war era, and although in the three post-war seasons during which Spurs languished in the Second Division, some games still drew large crowds, particularly for cup ties. Hulme was sacked after he refused a suggestion to resign following an illness in March 1949. Arthur Rowe and title win (1949‚Äì1958) League title In May 1949 Rowe became Spurs manager at a salary of ¬£1,500 a year. He inherited the squad assembled by Hulme except for the one crucial signing he made when he took over, Alf Ramsey. Rowe introduced a new style of play, Push and run, which proved to be highly successful, and transformed the players into a team that were hard to beat in the 1949‚Äì50 season. Rowe started his tenure as manager with a 4‚Äì1 victory at Brentford, the beginning of an unbeaten run of 23 League and Cup games between 27 August 1949 and 14 January 1950. With a free-scoring attack force, the team won the Second Division convincingly with six games yet to play. They ended the season nine points in front, elevating them back into the top flight. After a shaky start to their 1950‚Äì51 season when they were trounced 4‚Äì1 at home by the Blackpool side of Stanley Matthews, Tottenham won eight consecutive games in October and November that included a 7‚Äì0 defeat of Jackie Milburn's Newcastle. Some considered the team of this season the best in Tottenham's history; guarding the goal was Ditchburn, one of Spurs' best ever goalkeepers, who was aided in defence by Ramsey, Clarke, and Willis; also influential were the captain Burgess and Nicholson, with the five forwards of Baily, Medley, Duquemin, Bennett and Walters completing the regular starting eleven. They finished the season ahead of Manchester United by three points, having won their First Division Championship title in the penultimate game of the season by beating Sheffield Wednesday with a solitary goal from Duquemin. That was Tottenham's first ever League title. Spurs Way The push and run tactics developed by Rowe were successful in his early years as manager. Rowe credited McWilliam for learning to play a quick passing game, which he developed into a style involving players playing in triangles, quickly laying the ball off to a teammate and running past the marking tackler to collect the return pass. Keeping to Rowe's maxim of \\"make it simple, make it quick\\", this method proved an effective way of moving the ball at pace with players' positions and responsibilities being totally fluid. It became an attractive fast-moving attacking style of play regarded by Tottenham fans to be the Spurs Way, which was adjusted and perfected in the later period under Bill Nicholson. Spurs finished second in the 1951‚Äì52 season, beaten to the title by a young Manchester United team. A bad winter and the poor state of the White Hart Lane pitch were contributory, as the \\"push and run\\" style of play required a good firm playing surface. The following years witnessed a period of decline, as great players aged but younger players such as Tony Marchi and Tommy Harmer were not yet experienced enough, and with injuries and other teams adapting to Spurs' revolutionary style of play, it meant a struggle for the once-dominant team. Spurs could only finish tenth in the 1952‚Äì53 season. The \\"push and run\\" team also started to disperse; Medley, Willis, Bennett and Burgess left to join other teams while Nicholson moved into coaching. In 1954 Rowe signed future captain Danny Blanchflower for a club record fee of ¬£30,000. Blanchflower won the FWA Footballer of the Year twice while at Tottenham. Post-Rowe The stress of managing the team had affected Rowe's health, and he suffered a breakdown in 1954; he resigned after falling ill again the following year. Rowe's assistant and long-time club servant Jimmy Anderson stepped into the breach as manager, but the season ended with Spurs in the lower half of the table. With Blanchflower in the team, Ramsey was dropped from the line-up, and he soon left to start his managerial career with Ipswich Town, later guiding England to a World Cup win. Spurs were almost relegated at the end of the 1955‚Äì56 season, finishing just two points above the drop zone. In the 1956‚Äì57 season, under the guidance of Bill Nicholson as coach, the creative pairing of Blanchflower and Harmer, and the scoring prowess of Bobby Smith, the club experienced a revival and finished in second place, albeit eight points behind the winners, the \\"Busby Babes\\" of Manchester United. Tottenham also fared well in the following season, finishing third. As manager, Anderson started to build a new team by signing, bringing in or promoting some of the players who became members of the team that saw major success later: Cliff Jones, Terry Medwin, Peter Baker, Ron Henry, Terry Dyson, Maurice Norman and Smith. Bill Nicholson and the glory years (1958‚Äì1974) Spurs players of 1961, including club legends Cliff Jones, John White, Bobby Smith, Dave Mackay, and Danny Blanchflower. Jimmy Greaves was signed a month or so after this picture was taken. In October 1958, with the pressure of a poor start to the season and failing health, Anderson resigned, to be replaced by Bill Nicholson. Nicholson had joined Tottenham as an apprentice in 1936, and the following sixty-eight years saw him serve the club in every capacity from boot room to president. He became the most successful Spurs manager, guiding Tottenham to major trophy success three seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the double in 1961, the FA Cup and European Cup semi-final in 1962 and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1963. In Nicholson's first game as manager, on 11 October 1958, Spurs beat Everton 10‚Äì4, their then record win, but the team finished 18th in the league in his first season in charge. In the following 1959‚Äì60 season, Spurs improved to third place in the league, two points behind the champions Burnley. They also beat Crewe Alexandra 13‚Äì2 in the 1959‚Äì60 FA Cup with five goals coming from Les Allen. It remains the highest scoring FA Cup tie of the 20th century and is still the club's record win. In his first two years in charge, Nicholson made several signings‚ÄîDave Mackay and John White, the two influential players of the Double-winning team, as well as Allen and goalkeeper Bill Brown. Double winners Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in 1960 with Danny Blanchflower and both goalkeepers, Bill Brown and John Hollowbread, among others in the team with Bill Nicholson as manager. The 1960‚Äì61 season started with a 2‚Äì0 home win against Everton, the beginning of a run of eleven wins. The winning run was interrupted by a 1‚Äì1 draw against Manchester City, followed by another four wins before the unbeaten streak was broken by a loss to Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough in November. It remained the best ever start by any club in the top flight of English football until it was surpassed by Manchester City in 2017. The title was won on 17 April 1961 when Spurs beat the eventual runners-up Sheffield Wednesday at home 2‚Äì1, with three games still to play. In this Double-winning season only seventeen players were used in all forty-nine league and cup games, three of them playing only once. The team was built around the quartet of Blanchflower, Mackay, Jones, and White; completing the side were Smith (top scorer of the season), Allen, Henry, Norman, Baker, Dyson and Brown, with Medwin, Marchi, and a young Frank Saul among the reserves. Spurs reached the final of the 1960‚Äì61 FA Cup, beating along the way Sunderland 5‚Äì0 in the sixth-round replay and Burnley 3‚Äì0 in the semi-final. Spurs met Leicester City in the 1961 FA Cup Final and won 2‚Äì0, helped in part by Leicester being effectively reduced to ten men owing to injury (no substitutions were allowed at that time). Spurs became the first team in England to win the Double in the 20th century, and the first since Aston Villa achieved the feat in 1897. First European triumph Danny Blanchflower with the Cup Winners' Cup trophy in 1963, carried by other Spurs players Tottenham competed for the first time in a European competition in the 1961‚Äì62 European Cup. Their first opponents were G√≥rnik Zabrze, who beat Spurs 4‚Äì2. After the match the Polish press described Spurs players as \\"no angels\\"; in response, in the return leg at White Hart Lane, some Spurs fans dressed up as angels holding placards with slogans such as \\"Glory be to shining White Hart Lane\\", and other fans joined in by singing the refrains of \\"Glory Glory Hallelujah\\". Spurs won 8‚Äì1 to the sound of fans singing \\"Glory glory hallelujah, and the Spurs go marching on\\", which became an anthem for Tottenham from that night onwards. Spurs eventually lost in the semi-final to the holders Benfica, who went on to win the competition. A month later Spurs won the FA Cup again after beating Burnley in the 1962 FA Cup Final. The first goal of the game was scored by Jimmy Greaves, who was signed in December 1961 for ¬£99,999 (so as not to be the first ¬£100,000 player). Greaves became the top goal scorer for Tottenham with 220 league goals and 321 goals in all appearances for the club, and the most prolific scorer ever in the top tier of English football. In the 1962‚Äì63 European Cup Winners' Cup, Spurs reached the final, beating Rangers 8‚Äì4 on aggregate, Slovan Bratislava 6‚Äì2, and OFK Belgrade 5‚Äì2 on aggregate. Spurs' 5‚Äì1 win in the Cup Winners' Cup Final against Atl√©tico Madrid in Rotterdam on 15 May 1963, during which Terry Dyson scored a goal from 25 yards out, made Tottenham the first British team to win a European trophy. Continuing success By 1964 the Double-winning side was beginning to break up owing to age, injuries and transfers. Captain Danny Blanchflower hung up his boots that spring at the age of 38, troubled by a knee injury, and Dave Mackay was sidelined for a long period with his leg broken twice‚Äîthe first occurred during Spurs' defence of the Cup Winners' Cup against Manchester United, resulting in the 10-men Spurs being eliminated from the competition. In the summer of 1964, John White was tragically killed by lightning on a golf course. Nicholson rebuilt the team with new players, most of them imports, including Alan Mullery, Pat Jennings, Cyril Knowles, Mike England, Terry Venables, Jimmy Robertson, Phil Beal, Joe Kinnear, and Alan Gilzean who formed a goal-scoring partnership with Greaves. The rebuilding culminated in a win at the 1967 FA Cup Final over Chelsea with goals from wingers Robertson and Saul, and a third-place finish in the league. The team failed to make much of an impact in the following two seasons, reaching only in 1969 the semi-final of the League Cup, a competition created in 1960 but one in which Tottenham did not participate until 1966. Mackay, Jones and Robertson left the club in 1968, followed by Venables in 1969. In their place came the home-grown players Steve Perryman, Ray Evans and John Pratt, and new signing Martin Chivers. Martin Peters also arrived from West Ham United for a record fee of ¬£200,000 in 1970 in part-exchange for a reluctant Greaves, while Ralph Coates was signed in the summer of 1971 for ¬£192,000 from Burnley. Gilzean recreated the goal-scoring partnership with Chivers that he had with Greaves, this time aided by the blindside runs of Peters. The revitalised team reached the League Cup final in 1971, where they beat Aston Villa 2‚Äì0 to win their first League Cup with Chivers scoring both goals. They won the League Cup again in 1973 after beating Norwich City by a single goal from Coates in the final. The 1971 Cup win and a third-place finish in the 1970‚Äì71 season earned Spurs a place in the inaugural UEFA Cup. They reached the final after a battling performance to draw against A.C. Milan at the San Siro stadium in the second leg of the semi-final, giving them a 3‚Äì2 win on aggregate. In the first leg of the UEFA Cup final against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Chivers scored twice to give Spurs a 2‚Äì1 lead. In the return leg at White Hart Lane, team captain Mullery headed in a goal in his last game for the club for a 3‚Äì2 win on aggregate. With this victory, Spurs became the first British team to win two different European trophies. In total Nicholson had won eight major trophies in sixteen years; his spell in charge was the most successful period in the club's history. Decline and revival under Keith Burkinshaw (1974‚Äì1984) Although Tottenham managed to reach four cup finals in four years and winning three of them from 1971 to 1974, the team began to decline as Nicholson was unable to sign the players he wanted, in part because of his refusal to meet the demands for under-the-counter payments. The early seventies was also the beginning of a period of increasing football violence; rioting by Spurs fans in Rotterdam in their loss to Feyenoord in the 1974 UEFA Cup Final added to his disillusionment. Nicholson resigned after a poor start to the 1974‚Äì75 season and a 4‚Äì0 loss to Middlesbrough in the League Cup, but his tenure ended on a sour note. He had sought to be succeeded by Blanchflower as manager and Johnny Giles as player-coach, but the chairman Sidney Wale was angered by Nicholson contacting the pair without informing him first. The club then severed all ties with a ¬£10,000 payoff, even though Nicholson had wanted to stay on as an advisor, and refused him a testimonial (Nicholson was later brought back as advisor by Keith Burkinshaw and was only given a testimonial in 1983 under a different chairman). Terry Neill was appointed manager by the board, and Spurs narrowly avoided relegation at the end of the 1974‚Äì75 season. Spurs performed better the following season, in which Glenn Hoddle played his first game for the club. A former Arsenal player, Neill was never accepted by the fans, and he left to manage Arsenal in mid-1976, replaced by his assistant Keith Burkinshaw whom he had recruited the previous year. Relegation In Burkinshaw's first year as manager in the 1976‚Äì77 season, Tottenham slipped out of the First Division after 27 years in the top flight. Many of the early '70s Cup-winning team had by now left or retired. This was followed in the summer of 1977 by the sale of their Northern Ireland international goalkeeper Pat Jennings for a bargain ¬£45,000 to Arsenal as Burkinshaw had started to use Barry Daines, a move that shocked the club's fans and one that Burkinshaw later admitted was a great error. Jennings played on for another seven seasons for Spurs' arch-rivals. Despite relegation, the board kept faith with Burkinshaw and the team immediately won promotion to the top flight, although it took until the final league game of the season for them to be promoted. A sudden loss of form at the end of the 1977‚Äì78 season meant the club needed a point in the last game at Southampton. To Tottenham's great relief, the game ended 0‚Äì0 and Spurs returned to the First Division. Early in the season, Spurs had won 9‚Äì0 at home to Bristol Rovers, with four of their goals coming from debutant striker Colin Lee. The glut of goals proved significant later on as Tottenham won promotion through goal difference. Cup wins and European success Ajax vs Spurs Cup Winners' Cup first round in 1981. Notable Spurs players in this match include Steve Perryman, Osvaldo Ardiles, Graham Roberts, Steve Archibald, Ricardo Villa, and Glenn Hoddle (not all shown here). In the summer of 1978, Burkinshaw caused a stir by signing for ¬£750,000 two Argentinian internationals Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa‚Äîplayers from beyond the British Isles in English football were rare at the time. This was also a period of rebuilding as young players were brought in from the youth team, such as Mark Falco, Paul Miller, Chris Hughton and Micky Hazard, as well as other players signed from other clubs such as Graham Roberts, Tony Galvin, and in particular the twin strike force of Garth Crooks and Steve Archibald. Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa holding the FA Cup trophy won in 1981 Spurs opened the 1980s by reaching the 100th FA Cup Final in 1981 against Manchester City, and won the replay 3‚Äì2 in a match notable for the winning goal from Ricardo Villa. They lifted the FA Cup again the next season, beating Queens Park Rangers in the 1982 Final. Although they were also in contention for three other trophies that season, they finished fourth in the First Division, lost to Liverpool in the League Cup final in extra time, while Barcelona won at home in the Cup Winners' Cup semi-final after a 1‚Äì1 draw at White Hart Lane. The club began a new phase of redevelopment at White Hart Lane in 1980, starting with the rebuilding of the West Stand initiated by a new chairman Arthur Richardson. The West Stand was demolished and a new stand, which took 15 months to complete, opened in 1982. Cost overruns on the project, which rose from ¬£3.5 million to ¬£6 million, as well as the cost of rebuilding the team in the return to Division One resulted in financial difficulties for the club. In this period, property developer and Spurs fan Irving Scholar began buying up shares in the club. He took advantage of a rift in the boardroom between Richardson and former chairman Sidney Wale, and persuaded Wale to sell his shares. Scholar bought up 25% of the club for ¬£600,000, and with the help of Paul Bobroff who had bought 15% of shares from the family of previous chairman Bearman, took control in December 1982. Scholar inherited a club in debt to the tune of nearly ¬£5 million, what was then the largest debt in English football, but a rights issue after he took over brought in a million pounds. In 1983, a new holding company, Tottenham Hotspur plc, was formed with the football club run as a subsidiary of the company. With a valuation of ¬£9 million, the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange, the first sports club to do so. Together with Martin Edwards of Manchester United and David Dein of Arsenal, Scholar transformed English football clubs into business ventures that applied commercial principles to the running of the clubs to maximise their revenues, a process that eventually led to the formation of the Premier League. In 1984, Tottenham reached the final of the UEFA Cup. After 1‚Äì1 scores in both legs against Anderlecht, Tottenham emerged the victor when Tony Parks saved a penalty in the penalty shootout. This was the third of the major trophies won by the club under Burkinshaw in the 1980s. Several weeks before this victory, Burkinshaw announced that he would be leaving at the end of that season after disagreements with the directors and becoming disenchanted with the club. Shreeves and Pleat (1984‚Äì1987) Burkinshaw was succeeded as manager by his assistant Peter Shreeves in June 1984. According to Scholar, Aberdeen manager Alex Ferguson, who joined Manchester United two years later, had reneged on an agreement to take over. Tottenham enjoyed a strong start to the 1984‚Äì85 season and looked poised to win the league title by the winter, but a series of poor home results in 1985 resulted in the team being leapfrogged by eventual champions Everton and runners-up Liverpool. Their final position of third place in the league should have secured them a UEFA Cup place, but the Heysel disaster on 29 May 1985, which saw 39 spectators crushed to death when Liverpool fans rioted at the 1985 European Cup Final, resulted in all English clubs being banned from European competitions. In 1986, Perryman departed after 19 years at the club (17 years in the first team) and a record 655 league appearances. The same year Spurs also sold its training ground at Cheshunt that the club had owned since 1952 for over ¬£4 million. The 1985‚Äì86 season proved disappointing despite the signings of Chris Waddle and Paul Allen in the summer of 1985, and Shreeves was sacked at the end of the season. Luton Town manager David Pleat was appointed the new manager following Shreeves' dismissal. For much of 1986‚Äì87, Spurs played with what was for that time an unusual five-man midfield formation: Hoddle, Ardiles, Allen, Waddle and Steve Hodge. The lone striker Clive Allen scored 49 goals in all competitions that season, still a club record. Tottenham remained in contention for all three major domestic honours throughout the season, but finished the season empty-handed. In the League Cup, Tottenham lost to eventual competition winners Arsenal in the semi-final. Spurs also missed out on the First Division title to Everton, and stumbled to a 3‚Äì2 loss in the FA Cup final to Coventry City, whose winning goal was deflected off Gary Mabbutt's knee for an own goal in the final minutes. The close season of 1987 saw the sale of Glenn Hoddle to Monaco after a decade as the driving force in Tottenham's midfield. Terry Venables (1987‚Äì1993) In October 1987, Pleat quit the club following allegations about his private life. He was succeeded by former player Terry Venables, who had by then built up an impressive managerial record. He inherited a Spurs side that was struggling in the league with a quarter of the 1987‚Äì88 season played. Earlier in the season veteran goalkeeper Ray Clemence had to retire after suffering an Achilles tendon injury, and new signings by Venables Terry Fenwick and Paul Walsh failed to lift the team, which finished in 13th place. Striker Clive Allen was also less prolific in attack in this season, and he was sold to French club Bordeaux in March 1988. To invigorate the Tottenham side, Venables paid a national record ¬£2 million for Newcastle midfielder Paul Gascoigne in June 1988, and also signed striker Paul Stewart from Manchester City for ¬£1.7 million. Spurs made a shaky start to the 1988‚Äì89 season; incomplete refurbishment of the East Stand caused the postponement of the opening game against Coventry just a few hours before kickoff, which earned the club a two- point deduction (later replaced by a ¬£15,000 fine), and this was followed by a string of losses in October. They were second from bottom at the end of October, but improved to ninth place by the turn of 1989 and finished sixth in the final table. Cup win and boardroom drama By the end of the 1980s and the beginning of 1990s, Spurs had become mired in considerable financial difficulties, with a debt reported to be ¬£20 million in 1991. The East Stand was refurbished in 1989 but its cost had doubled to over ¬£8 million, while the company's attempts to diversify into other businesses such as the clothing firms Hummel UK and Martex failed to generate the income expected and were in fact losing them money. July 1989 saw the arrival at White Hart Lane of England striker Gary Lineker from Barcelona for a fee of ¬£1.2 million; however, the cash-strapped club was unable to pay Barcelona in full even though Waddle was sold days later to Marseille for ¬£4.25 million. Scholar had to organise a secret ¬£1.1 million loan from Robert Maxwell, which caused an uproar and resulted in an attempt to oust Scholar from the boardroom when it was revealed. Maxwell, who first owned Oxford United and then Derby County, became interested in the club, putting Derby County up for sale so that he could acquire Tottenham. Venables, who had previously attempted to buy the club but failed, then joined forces with businessman Alan Sugar in June 1991 to forestall a takeover by Maxwell and gain control of Tottenham Hotspur plc, buying out Scholar for ¬£2 million. With Lineker and Gascoigne in the team, Spurs finished third in the 1989‚Äì90 title race won by Liverpool. In the following 1990‚Äì91 season, they began the season unbeaten in ten games, but failed to rediscover their earlier league form in the second half of the season, eventually finishing tenth in the final table. Despite the middling ranking, this season remains a highlight for Tottenham for their performances in the 1990‚Äì91 FA Cup. A 3‚Äì1 semi-final win over Arsenal featured a 30-yard free kick from Gascoigne considered to be one of the best goals ever seen in the competition. In the final against Nottingham Forest, Gascoigne suffered serious cruciate ligament damage in his knee when he made a reckless tackle on opponent Gary Charles. Winning the match 2‚Äì1 after extra time, Spurs became the first team to collect eight FA Cups, a record later surpassed by Manchester United in 1996. The excitement in North London over the win also had the unexpected result of prompting Sugar, who had little knowledge of the club's history (and was alleged to have asked \\"What Double?\\" when someone mentioned Tottenham's Double), to contact Venables and jointly buy the club. Gascoigne was a transfer target for Italian club Lazio, but his knee injury (aggravated later in a nightclub incident) meant that he missed the 1991‚Äì92 season, and his transfer to Lazio was put on hold. By the summer of 1992, his knee had recovered and he completed his move to Lazio for ¬£5.5 million, reduced from the ¬£7.9 million fees agreed before his injury. Gary Lineker then announced in November that he would be leaving Spurs at the end of the season to play in Japan, while Paul Walsh and Paul Stewart also left the club. In the 1991‚Äì92 season, Venables became chief executive of the club, and Shreeves again took charge of first-team duties. During the summer of 1992, Venables decided to return to team management; Shreeves was sacked, and a European style of management was instituted with Doug Livermore the head coach and Clemence the assistant. Although Sugar and Venables began as equal partners with each investing ¬£3.25 million in the club, Sugar's financial clout allowed him to increase his stake to ¬£8 million in December 1991, thereby gaining control of the club. In May 1993, after a row at a board meeting, Terry Venables was controversially dismissed from the Tottenham board by Sugar, whose decision was overturned in the High Court but reversed on appeal. Despite being initially seen as a saviour of the club, the ousting of a popular figure, later aggravated by a perceived lack of investment in the club, earnt Sugar long-lasting animosity from some fans who repeatedly called for his resignation. Beginning of Premier League football (1992‚Äì2004) Spurs were one of the five clubs that pushed for the founding of the Premier League, created with the approval of The Football Association to replace the Football League First Division as the highest division of English football. To coincide with the massive changes in English football, Tottenham made major signings, including winger Darren Anderton, defender Neil Ruddock, and striker Teddy Sheringham for what was then a club record ¬£2.1 million from Nottingham Forest. The Sheringham transfer was later the subject of allegations of \\"bungs\\" against Forest manager Brian Clough. In the first ever Premier League season‚ÄîVenables' final year as Spurs' manager‚ÄîSpurs finished eighth. Teddy Sheringham was the division's top scorer with 22 goals, 21 of which were scored for Tottenham. Ardiles, Francis and Gross The departure of Venables saw Tottenham return to a conventional management setup after two seasons of a two-tier structure. Former player Osvaldo Ardiles took charge of the first team. In the 1993‚Äì94 season, Sheringham's injury in October 1993 impacted on Spurs' performance, and relegation became a real possibility. In the end, the club managed a 15th-place finish, its survival only guaranteed by a win in the penultimate game of the season. By this time Spurs had come under investigation for financial irregularities alleged to have taken place in the 1980s while Irving Scholar was chairman, and in June 1994 the club was found guilty of making illegal payments to players. Spurs were fined ¬£600,000, had twelve league points deducted for the 1994‚Äì95 season and were banned from the 1994‚Äì95 FA Cup. Following an appeal the number of points deducted was reduced, but the fine was increased to ¬£1.5 million. A further arbitration (after Sugar threatened to sue the FA) quashed the points deduction and FA Cup ban, although the fine remained in place. Despite the penalty, the club aimed to have a successful season in 1994‚Äì95, and signed three players who had appeared at that summer's World Cup: German striker J√ºrgen Klinsmann and two Romanians, Ilie Dumitrescu and Gheorghe Popescu. Forward players in Spurs line-up already included Sheringham, Anderton and Nick Barmby, and Ardiles chose to play five attacking players, dubbed the \\"Famous Five\\" of Klinsmann, Sheringham, Anderton, Barmby, and Dumitrescu. Their debut in the 1994‚Äì95 season against Sheffield Wednesday in August 1994, which Spurs won 4‚Äì3, was described as a \\"breathtaking exhibition of football\\", but the imbalance in the team also leaked goals (33 in 15 games). Spurs struggled in September with a series of defeats, and after the team lost 3‚Äì0 in the League Cup in October, Ardiles was dismissed. At that time Spurs were just two places above the relegation zone, although they would have been 11th in the table with the deducted points that were later restored. Ardiles was replaced by Gerry Francis, who alleviated relegation fears and oversaw the club's climb to seventh place in the league, just missing out on a 1995‚Äì96 UEFA Cup place. When the FA Cup ban was lifted, Spurs reached the FA Cup semi-final where they were defeated 4‚Äì1 by eventual winners Everton. Klinsmann was top scorer at the club with twenty-nine in all competitions, but he felt that Spurs would not be able to challenge for the title in future seasons, and returned to his homeland to sign with Bayern Munich. Barmby, Dumitrescu and Popescu also departed, and Francis signed the likes of Ruel Fox and Chris Armstrong for more than ¬£4 million each but spurned the chance to sign Dennis Bergkamp who was a fan of the Glenn Hoddle and was interested in joining Spurs. Other signings include future captain Ledley King who did not start in the first team for a few years. Francis' transfer dealings failed to deliver European qualification or higher, and Spurs finished eighth in 1996 and tenth in 1997. Sheringham left in the summer of 1997 for Manchester United while Les Ferdinand joined the team for a record ¬£6 million and David Ginola for ¬£2.5 million from Newcastle. Ferdinand was soon hit by injury, and in November 1997, Francis decided to resign after Spurs were beaten 4‚Äì0 by Liverpool. White Hart Lane as it appeared from the late 1990s until 2016 Christian Gross, coach of Swiss champions Grasshoppers, was chosen as the successor to Francis. Gross failed to turn around the club's fortunes in the 1997‚Äì98 season, and the team battled against the drop for the remainder of the campaign. Klinsmann returned to Spurs in December on loan, and four goals in a 6‚Äì2 win away to Wimbledon in the penultimate game of the season was enough to secure survival. By the end of the season, the renovation of the White Hart Lane stadium was completed. White Hart Lane was converted into an all-seater stadium in the 1990s, the South Stand was rebuilt, and a new tier added to the North Stand, leaving the stadium with a capacity of about 36,240. The stadium remained in this form bar some minor changes until 2016. George Graham and League Cup win After losing two of the first three games of the 1998‚Äì99 season, Gross was sacked, and former Arsenal manager George Graham was hired to take over. Graham signed Steffen Freund, who became a fans' favourite, as well as Tim Sherwood. Fans were critical of Graham due to his association with Arsenal and disliked his defensive style of football, especially when Ars√®ne Wenger was starting to achieve major success at Arsenal with an attacking football style previously associated with Spurs. Nevertheless, in Graham's first season as Spurs manager, 1998‚Äì99, the club secured a mid-table finish and won the League Cup. In the final against Leicester City at Wembley Stadium, full-back Justin Edinburgh was sent off after an altercation with Robbie Savage, but the ten-men Spurs secured a dramatic victory through Allan Nielsen's diving header in the 93rd minute of the game. To cap a good season, David Ginola won both the PFA Players' Player of the Year and Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year awards in the year Manchester United won the Treble. The club finished mid-table the following year. In May 2000, Tottenham signed Ukrainian striker Sergei Rebrov from Dynamo Kyiv for a club record ¬£11 million. But Rebrov was not a success at White Hart Lane, managing just ten goals over the next four seasons. New ownership and Glenn Hoddle In late 2000, Sugar decided to sell his share holding in the club, a decision he blamed on the hostility of fans towards him and his family. 27% of his 40% share holding in Tottenham were sold for ¬£22m to ENIC Sports PLC, and he stepped down as chairman in February 2001 on the completion of the sale. The rest of his shares were sold in 2007 for ¬£25m. ENIC, owned by Joe Lewis and Daniel Levy with the latter responsible for the running of the club, would eventually acquire 85% of Tottenham. The club was transferred into its private ownership in 2012. A month after Levy took over as chairman, George Graham was sacked as manager for alleged breach of contract by vice-chairman David Buchler after Graham commented on the financial position of Spurs. Team management passed to former Tottenham player Glenn Hoddle, who took over in the final weeks of the 2000‚Äì01 season from caretaker manager David Pleat. His first game was a defeat to Arsenal in the 2001 FA Cup semi-final. That summer, club captain Sol Campbell joined Arsenal on a Bosman free transfer. The loss of a transfer fee by Spurs, the move to their bitterest rivals, and the perceived underhanded fashion in which he negotiated his move (claimed to be a record ¬£100,000 per week) led to long- term enmity towards Campbell from Spurs fans. Hoddle turned to more experienced players in the shape of Teddy Sheringham who returned to Spurs in May 2001, as well as new signings Gus Poyet and Christian Ziege. Spurs played some encouraging football in the opening months of his management, but they ended the 2001‚Äì02 season in ninth place. They reached the League Cup final, where they lost to Blackburn, despite being seen as the favourites after their 5‚Äì1 defeat of Chelsea in the previous round. The only significant outlay before the following campaign was the ¬£7 million signing of Robbie Keane, who joined from Leeds United. Jamie Redknapp also joined earlier on a free transfer. The 2002‚Äì03 season started well, with Tottenham top of the league after three successive wins, and Hoddle voted manager of the month in the division for August. They were still in the top six as late as early February, but the season ended with a tenth-place finish, the result of a barren final ten games of the league campaign that delivered a mere seven points. Several players publicly criticised Hoddle's management and communication skills. In the following 2003‚Äì04 season, Spurs started the season poorly, gaining only four points out of six games. With Spurs struggling third from bottom at the table, Hoddle was sacked by Levy, and Pleat again took over as caretaker manager. Resurgence and the Champions League (2004‚Äì2014) Robbie Keane prepares to take a penalty at White Hart Lane, 2005 In June 2004, Tottenham appointed French team manager Jacques Santini as head coach, with Martin Jol as his assistant and Frank Arnesen as sporting director. In early November, after only 13 games in charge, Santini decided to quit the club, making his the shortest stint by any Spurs manager. Santini was replaced by Jol, and the team managed to secure a ninth-place finish in the 2004‚Äì05 season. In June 2005, when Arnesen moved to Chelsea, Spurs appointed Damien Comolli as sporting director. Among the players signed by Jol were Edgar Davids in 2005, Dimitar Berbatov in 2006, and Gareth Bale in May 2007. Players who left included Michael Carrick, who went to Manchester United for a reported ¬£18.6 million in 2006. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, Spurs spent six months in the top four. Going into the final game of the season, they led Arsenal by a point, but were defeated in their final match‚Äîaway to West Ham‚Äîafter many players including Keane and Carrick succumbed to food poisoning from a meal they had the night before. Spurs were pipped to a UEFA Champions League place, but gained a place in the UEFA Cup and achieved their highest finish for 16 years. In 2006‚Äì07, they finished fifth for the second-straight year. 2008 Carling Cup final, Spurs beat Chelsea 2‚Äì1 The 2007‚Äì08 season saw the club win only one of their first ten League matches, their worst start in 19 years. Jol was sacked, learning of his removal just before a Uefa Cup game on 25 October 2007. Juande Ramos, formerly of Sevilla, then replaced the Dutchman as manager. Captained by Ledley King, Spurs went on to win the League Cup, beating Chelsea 2‚Äì1 in the League Cup Final in February 2008. Luka Modriƒá was signed towards the end of the season, but Berbatov and Keane were sold to Manchester United and Liverpool respectively in the summer as both wanted to leave. Tottenham made their worst start to a season in the club's history in 2008‚Äì09, their failure to register a win in eight League games leaving them bottom of the Premier League. Ramos and Director of Football Damien Comolli were dismissed on 25 October 2008, amid Levy's criticism of the failure to recruit suitable replacements for Berbatov and Keane. Harry Redknapp Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp was appointed as Ramos' replacement, and Tottenham reverted to a traditional setup with Redknapp responsible for both coaching and player transfers. Redknapp took the club out of the relegation zone by winning 10 out of the 12 points available in his first two weeks in charge, and finished the 2008‚Äì09 campaign eighth in the league table. The January transfer window saw the return of Keane and Jermain Defoe to the club after spells at Liverpool and Portsmouth respectively, later joined by Peter Crouch signed in the summer, and Rafael van der Vaart in 2010. North London derby at the Emirates in 2010 that finished 2‚Äì3. Spurs players here include Luka Modriƒá, Jermaine Jenas, and Gareth Bale. The team's performance improved in the two following seasons. Notable matches in the 2009‚Äì10 season include the 9‚Äì1 home win against Wigan Athletic, with Defoe scoring five, a record win in the top flight for the club, and a 2‚Äì1 against Arsenal, with goals from Bale and debutant Danny Rose, giving them their first Premier League victory against their rivals. Spurs finished the 2009‚Äì10 season in fourth place, and reached the qualifying rounds of the Champions League for the first time in their history. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, they qualified for the group stages of the Champions League, came top of their group and went on to beat A.C. Milan 1‚Äì0 on aggregate in the knockout stage. At the quarter-finals, Spurs suffered a heavy defeat against Real Madrid after Crouch was sent off early in the game, and the 10-men team was beaten 4‚Äì0 at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium, and 5‚Äì0 on aggregate. Earlier in the season they won at the Emirates with goals from van der Vaart and Bale, their first win at Arsenal in 17 years. At the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season, the home league game to Everton was cancelled because of rioting in Tottenham a week before the game, and Spurs then lost the next two games. Tottenham managed to record ten wins and one draw in their next eleven Premier League matches, and finished the season in fourth place in the Premier League but failed to qualify for the Champions League. On 13 June 2012, after brief contract renewal talks during which Redknapp and the Tottenham board failed to agree terms, Redknapp was dismissed by the club. Villas-Boas and Sherwood Following Redknapp's departure, the club appointed former Chelsea and Porto coach Andr√© Villas-Boas as manager. Shortly after his appointment, the club pipped Liverpool for the signature of Swansea City midfielder Gylfi Sigur√∞sson. Several days later, the club also resolved the protracted transfer saga surrounding Ajax defender Jan Vertonghen. They were soon followed by Hugo Lloris and Mousa Demb√©l√©, while Modric left for Real Madrid. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, they finished fifth. Despite winning a dramatic match against Sunderland with a goal from Gareth Bale in the final match of the season, Arsenal won their last match to take the 2013‚Äì14 Champions League spot, and Spurs dropped to the Europa League for the second successive season. In their concurrent 2012‚Äì13 Europa League campaign, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Swiss side Basel on penalties. At the beginning of the 2013‚Äì14 season, Bale moved to Real Madrid for what was then a world record transfer fee of ‚Ç¨100.8 million (¬£85.1 million). This money paid for several players signed in that transfer window, including Christian Eriksen and Erik Lamela. Following a 6‚Äì0 defeat against Manchester City and a 5‚Äì0 defeat against Liverpool, Villas-Boas was dismissed from his role on 16 December 2013. A week later, former Spurs player Tim Sherwood became Villas- Boas' replacement as manager as a stopgap measure. Although Sherwood led Spurs to a sixth-place finish in the Premier League, his results against the top teams were disappointing, and he was sacked on 13 May 2014. Pochettino era (2014‚Äì2019) Some of Spurs' starting line-up in the 2016‚Äì17 season, including Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld Mauricio Pochettino was appointed Tottenham manager on 27 May 2014, on a five-year contract. In his first season Spurs finished fifth in the 2014‚Äì15 Premier League with 64 points, and were runners-up in the 2015 Football League Cup Final. Pochettino chose to promote young players, and in his second season in charge, Spurs had the youngest team in the Premier League. A new generation of players that included Harry Kane, Dele Alli, and Eric Dier were all aged 22 or younger that season. Spurs had a much improved 2015‚Äì16 season, but their title challenge ended with a 2‚Äì2 draw at Stamford Bridge on 2 May 2016, and they finished third behind winners Leicester. The following 2016‚Äì17 season began with a series of 12 unbeaten league matches, but the team performed inconsistently during the first half of the season. They put in a much better performance in 2017, including a win in the North London derby that ensured a higher finish in the Premier League than their rivals Arsenal for the first time in 22 years. Their early inconsistency meant that Spurs were unable to overhaul the lead of the eventual champions Chelsea in the league table (13 points over Spurs at one stage in March), and finished the season in second place with 86 points, their highest ever points tally since the Premier League began. This is their highest ranking in 54 years since the 1962‚Äì63 season under Bill Nicholson, and the team also achieved their first unbeaten home run in 52 years since the 1964‚Äì65 season. New stadium Tottenham Hotspur Stadium The construction of a new stadium was initiated at on land adjacent to White Hart Lane in 2015. The new stadium has a seating capacity of 62,062, considerably greater than the 36,000 of White Hart Lane. A section of the North Stand was removed to allow building work on the new stadium to proceed next to the old stadium. The removal of part of the stand reduced the capacity of the stadium, and European matches were held at Wembley Stadium for the 2016‚Äì17 season to comply with the ticketing requirement for European games. A club attendance record of 85,512 spectators was reported for the 2016‚Äì17 UEFA Champions League game against Bayer Leverkusen, which Spurs lost 1‚Äì0. Spurs played their last game at White Hart Lane on 14 May 2017, a 2‚Äì1 victory over Manchester United that secured their second place in the Premier League. In the summer of 2017, White Hart Lane was demolished to allow the new stadium to be completed, and all Tottenham's home games were played at Wembley for the 2017‚Äì18 season. As the stadium has a higher capacity, this season saw a series of record attendances for Premier League games, the highest at the North London Derby on 10 February 2018 when 83,222 spectators witnessed Spurs' 1‚Äì0 win over Arsenal. Tottenham failed to make any new signings in the summer transfer window of 2018, the first club not to do so in the Premier League. They also failed to sign anyone in the next transfer window in January. They nevertheless had their best start in the Premier League in the 2018‚Äì19 season, ended by a home defeat against Manchester City. After some delay, the new stadium, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, was completed and opened on 3 April 2019. The first game at the stadium, the Premier League game against Crystal Palace, was won by Tottenham 2‚Äì0, with Son Heung-min scoring the first ever official goal at the new stadium. Tottenham started the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Champions League poorly, gaining only one point in the first three games of the group stage. They managed to qualified for the knockout phase with a late equalising goal against Barcelona. After beating Borussia Dortmund in the Round of 16, the team staged a dramatic win on away goals (4‚Äì4 on aggregate) against Manchester City in the quarter-final, followed by a last-gasp victory over Ajax in the dying seconds of the semi- final, achieved with a hat-trick by Lucas Moura to overcome a 3‚Äì0 deficit on aggregate in the second half of the return leg. Tottenham reached their first ever Champions League final. However, they were beaten 2‚Äì0 in an uninspiring final, and finished runners-up. Jos√© Mourinho (2019‚Äì) The 2019‚Äì20 season started poorly for Tottenham, winning only three of their first 12 league games. Pochettino was sacked on 19 November 2019, to be replaced by Jos√© Mourinho as coach the following day.

Its institution served to federalise and Romanise Gallia Comata as an Imperial province under Augustus, following the Gallic Wars of his predecessor Julius Caesar. The distinctively Gallo-Roman development of the Imperial sanctuary and its surrounding complex are well attested by literary, epigraphic, numismatic and archaeological evidence.Duncan Fishwick, \\"The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire\\", vol 3, (2002), 1, 4-41. Foundation and function The Imperial cult sanctuary at Lugdunum was the earliest and most important institution of its kind in the Western Roman empire. Its establishment at the junction of three new Imperial provinces, later collectively known as Tres Galliae (the Three Gauls), embodied a policy of integrated military, civil and religious settlement among the unstable Western provinces of the newly established Principate.Fishwick, Vol 3, 1, 9: the term Tres Gallia dates from the reign of Vespasian. It was founded by Drusus in rapid response to a rebellion provoked by the census of Gallia Comata (\\"long-haired\\" Gaul) in 12 BC.Fishwick, Vol. 3, 1, 12. Lugdunum provided a centralised, permanent base for the Imperial governorships of Gallia Aquitania, Gallia Belgica and Gallia Lugdunensis, and an annual, Roman-style concilium (council) for their provincial elites, based on existing Gallic political and religious practices.Annual \\"tribal\\" or \\"civil\\" meetings were a long-standing feature of Gallic polity: see Caesar, Gallic Wars, 4.6.5; 5.2.4; 5.24.1 et al. The meetings may have been sanctified under the tutelage of Lugh: see also Maria Jaczynowska, \\"Une religion de la loyaut√© au d√©but de l'Empire romain\\", in Dialogues d'histoire ancienne, 15, 2, (1989), 164‚Äì5: (French). The monumentally lavish and comprehensively Roman development of the Sanctuary and its associated buildings provided a context for the acculturation of a new Romano-Gallic polity under the pax Romana, in which the Roman military maintained a relatively discreet local presence.A single urban cohort, according to Keppie, L. J. F., Legions and veterans: Roman army papers 1971-2000, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2000, 84: Inscription of Gaius Servilius Martianus, of the Arverni, who served as a priest (sacerdos) at the Temple of Roma and the AugustiCIL XIII 001706. As stepson to Augustus, Drusus represented the Imperial family and as provincial governor, he was also augur. The inaugural day of the sanctuary ‚Äì August 1 of either 10 BC or 12 BC ‚Äì was important to both Romans and Gauls. August ‚Äì formerly Sextilis in the Roman calendar ‚Äì had been renamed in honour of Augustus, and its kalends (the first day of the month) was particularly auspicious as the anniversary of his victory at Alexandria. A foundation (or an inauguration) in 12 BC would have coincided with Augustus' assumption of office as pontifex maximus. The ara (altar) was dedicated to Dea Roma and Augustus and its first high priest (sacerdos) was Caius Julius Vercondaridubnus, a Gaul of the Aeduan elite. His name indicates his Roman citizenship and Gallic origins - his election to Imperial priesthood may confirm a preference based on his personal standing and that of his civitas as fratres (\\"brothers\\", or allies) of Rome.Despite this, the Aeduian citizen-aristocrat Julius Sacrovir would be involved in a later rebellion, \\"seditiously\\" claiming - in Tacitus' account - high rates of tribute, indebtedness, and brutal governorship as causes: Tacitus, Annals, 3.40: .Duncan Fishwick, \\"The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire\\", volume 1, (1991), p. 101., & vol 3, (2002), 1, pp 12-13.Ronald Mellor, \\"The Goddess Roma,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt 2.17.2, p. 986 online.: Dio Cassius, 54.32.1, and Livy, Periochae, 139, give a date of 12 BC, against numismatic (and Suetonian) evidence for 10 BC. Mellor offers a scenario in which the first concilium convenes in 12 BC. The ara takes two years to complete, and is inaugurated in 10 BC ‚Äì possibly in the presence of Augustus, who is known to have been in Lugdunum at that time. Fishwick favours 12 BC, partly because this is Livy's date for what was to him a contemporaneous event. Drusus invited 60 aristocratic delegates to the opening ceremony as representatives of the \\"Three Gauls\\". These are presumed to be the first members of the official concilium Galliarum.Ronald Mellor, \\"The Goddess Roma,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt 2.17.2, p. 986 online. The office of sacerdos required Roman citizenship but the early concilium combined citizen and non- citizens. The sacredos would have been a person of great consequence within the concilium Galliarum and his own provincial ordo. His influence would have extended well beyond his term of office, which was - unlike the lifetime priesthoods of Rome itself - limited to a single year. In effect, the priesthood provided an important step in the provincial cursus honorum.Duncan Fishwick, \\"The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire\\", vol 3, (2002), 1, 12‚Äì13. Altar of Gauls, reconstructed from the image on Roman coins The concilia at Lugdunum were also displays of loyalty and Romanisation, which involved the renewal of vows through priestly sacrifice at the ara, feasting, games (ludi), contests of eloquence and poetry.Suetonius, Caligula, 20; Juvenal, 1.42‚Äì44; Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum II 6278. This calendrical gathering was accommodated by the building of a small amphitheatre, which was later much expanded. Lugdunum was also the site of a major Imperial mint, whose coinage provides a principal source of evidence for the form and development of the altar. The security requirement of the mint has been presumed to account for the presence of Lugdunum's single military cohort.Lugdunum remained the major Western Imperial mint until some time between 37 AD and 41 AD:Presence of cohort presumed as guard for mint: Keppie, L. J. F., Legions and veterans: Roman army papers 1971-2000, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2000, 84: Later Imperial development Following his defeat of Clodius Albinus and his allies at Lugdunum, Septimius Severus re-founded and reformed its Imperial cult centre as an instrument of suppression and autocracy. The image of dea Roma was removed from the ara and confined to the temple, along with the images of the living and deceased Augusti ‚Äì a combination unique in the Western Empire. Fishwick interprets the reformed rites of Septimius as those offered a Roman paterfamilias by his slaves.Fishwick,Vol. 3, 1, 199. This development took place shortly after 198/9 AD. Its duration and subsequent developments are unknown. Sanctuary The sanctuary was located on the hillside of la Croix- Rousse. The first and main altar can be reconstructed from texts and currency depictions. The geographer Strabo described it in context: \\"[Lugdunum] is the most populous of all the cities of Celtica except Narbo; for not only do people use it as an emporium, but the Roman governors coin their money there, both the silver and the gold. Again, the temple that was dedicated to Caesar Augustus by all the Galatae in common is situated in front of this city at the junction of the rivers. And in it is a noteworthy altar, bearing an inscription of the names of the tribes, sixty in number; and also images from these tribes, one from each tribe, and also another large altar.\\"Strabo, Geography, Thayer, Loeb edn. Fishwick suggests that the images (bronze statues) and inscriptions of Strabo's account are stylistically Greek additions to the ara some time after its inauguration.Duncan Fishwick, \\"The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire\\", vol 3, (2002), 1, 18. The monumental altar and its 50-meter base were made in marble. It was flanked by two winged victories of gilt bronze, holding palms and gold crowns, standing on ionic capitals, set on columns assumed to be the later source for the four pillars of the transept crossing of the basilica of St-Martin-d'Ainay, which support the dome. These were made from two longer pillars of Egyptian syenite, recovered in the 11th century and sawn in half. The open altar appears to have been rebuilt (or adapted) as a covered temple in 121 AD, in the reign of Hadrian.Duncan Fishwick, \\"The temple of the Three Gauls\\", in Journal of Roman Studies, 62, (1972) 46‚Äì52. The larger altar was the focus of cult to the genius of the living emperor and dea Roma. The temple was dedicated to the cult of deceased Imperial divi, and major Roman and local deities. This sanctuary was also the find-spot for the Lyon Tablet, a bronze plaque of 2.5 by 1.93 m on which is engraved Claudius's 48 AD speech making Gallic chieftains eligible for Roman magistracies and membership of the Roman Senate ‚Äì a version of the speech also survives in Tacitus. It was found by a draper in 1528, in his vineyard on the site of the sanctuary, and is now held in the Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon.

It is an underwater city that is the main setting for the games BioShock and BioShock 2. The city also briefly appears in BioShock Infinite, and is featured in its downloadable content, Burial at Sea. The game's back-story describes the city as envisioned by business tycoon Andrew Ryan in the mid-1940s as a means to create a utopia for mankind's greatest artists and thinkers to prosper in a laissez-faire environment outside of increasing oppression by the world's governments and religion. However, the lack of government made many people uneasy, and the masses turned toward political activists like Atlas who advocated stability under a government, turning the city into a dystopia; and on the eve of 1959, a civil war broke out, leaving much of Rapture's population dead. The remaining citizens either became psychotic \\"Splicers\\" due to the effects of ADAM, a substance that can alter genetic material, or have barricaded themselves from the Splicers to protect themselves, leaving the city to fail and fall apart around them. The player first experiences Rapture in BioShock, in 1960, a year after the fateful riots, as a man named Jack that has come to Rapture after a plane accident over the mid-Atlantic Ocean where the city was located; during this, the player comes to learn more about Ryan's motives and those that he struggled against to keep the city's ideals until the very end. In BioShock 2, the player takes the role of a \\"Big Daddy\\", a heavily modified humanoid in an armored diving suit, designed to maintain the city, and would soon come to serve the purpose of protecting the Little Sisters as they collect ADAM from \\"Angels\\", which are dead bodies that harbor significant amounts of ADAM; this takes place eight years after the events of the first game, and while Ryan has been killed, there remain those that vie for the vacuum left in his position of power. Rapture makes a brief appearance near the climax of BioShock Infinite, which is otherwise set in a different dystopian city, Columbia. Downloadable content for Infinite is set in Rapture on New Year's Eve 1959, a year before the events of the first BioShock and on the day of the civil war.  Concept and creation  The concept of Rapture was the brainchild of Ken Levine, founding member and creative director of Irrational Games, (briefly renamed 2K Boston just prior to BioShocks release, but later returned to their former name). Ken Levine had studied the works of Ayn Rand, George Orwell, and Aldous Huxley and other works of utopian and dystopian societies as part of his liberal arts degree. He had also had fascination with the story of Logan's Run. Levine also considered the nature of the horror genre, noting works such as The Shining where there is the need for a feeling of loss for the horror to be effective. Rapture's Art Deco architecture was heavily inspired by the locations and buildings of New York City, like the Rockefeller Center. Gotham City from the Batman universe also served as inspiration. Shawn Robertson stated that Art Deco fit really well into BioShock's budget, as the finished Art Deco models had large and simple solid shapes and were low poly. Rapture features a vast number of various artwork, and advertisements for businesses within the city, which many were inspired by real-world vintage advertisements.  Description  200px|thumb|right|Rapture is an underwater city with Art Deco designs.|alt=A cityscape under water, with buildings in a distinctive geometric Art Seco style. Rapture is an underwater city, located in the north Atlantic Ocean somewhere between Greenland and Iceland. It is only accessible by a system of bathyspheres. The city was designed to be self- sufficient, growing and raising its own crops as well as using the surrounding sea life for food, and taking advantage of submarine volcanoes to provide geothermal power to its population. The city consists of many \\"skyscrapers\\", inter-linked by walkways and tunnels, with watertight doors between neighboring sections to isolate areas that become flooded from the rest of the city. The buildings, both inside and out, feature a distinctive Art Deco design motif, reflecting on the era during which they were built (the mid-'40s). In addition to living quarters, Rapture features shopping areas, entertainment venues, laboratories, manufacturing plants, medical facilities, and other common services provided by a functional city. Though Rapture was built as a utopia for creative individuals to flourish, the city soon became a dystopia. Part of the downfall of Rapture was the discovery of ADAM, stem cells harvested from a previously unknown species of sea slug. Scientists in Rapture found that ADAM could be used to overwrite the human genome, allowing its users to literally \\"splice\\" super powers (such as telekinesis) into their DNA. The lead scientist, Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum, found that ADAM could be mass- produced by implanting the sea slug in the stomachs of young orphaned girls, who came to be known as \\"Little Sisters\\". The implantation process only worked on female children for an unknown reason. As Rapture began to fall into social chaos, in part due to the mental instability that came about from increased ADAM use, the Little Sisters were mentally reconditioned to extract ADAM from the dead and recycle it. In order to protect the girls from ADAM-hungry lunatics, Dr. Suchong generated genetically modified humans in armored diving suits, and assigned them to protect a specific Little Sister. These beings became known as \\"Big Daddies\\". When the player experiences the city, roughly one/ten years after the collapse of its society (one year in BioShock, ten years in BioShock 2), the majority of Rapture's population is dead; the few that survive have either become psychotic \\"Splicers\\", or survivors that have barricaded themselves from the Splicers. While most of the city's automated systems still operate, large swaths of the city have become flooded, while others have been damaged beyond repair, either as a result of the bloody civil war that tore Rapture apart, or as a consequence of the Splicers' ADAM-induced psychotic episodes. ADAM harvesting Little Sisters, accompanied by their Big Daddy protectors, continue to wander Rapture during the player's experiences in the city.  History  Rapture was formally founded on November 5, 1946. As described in the games' backstory and through in-game audio recordings, the city of Rapture was envisioned by the Randian business magnate Andrew Ryan, who wanted to create a laissez-faire state with no ties to the rest of the world to escape what he saw as increasingly oppressive political, economic, and religious authority on land. The city was fully completed in 1951. Scientific progress flourished in Rapture, leading to rapid developments in engineering and biotechnology, such as the invention of ADAM, thanks in part to the brilliant scientists that Ryan brought to the city. Though residents were hand-picked for their success on the surface, as time passed, the gap between rich and poor increased. This was exploited by Frank Fontaine, a businessman in charge of the plasmid industry who secretly established an illegal smuggling ring with the outside world while simultaneously creating charitable organizations to manipulate the underclass. A violent attempt to overthrow Ryan reportedly killed Fontaine, but the player's experience in BioShock reveals that Fontaine survived, disguising himself as the proletarian hero 'Atlas'. On New Year's Eve of 1959, Fontaine/Atlas and his ADAM-infused followers began a new revolt against Ryan, targeting a masquerade party hosted by the city-famous Kashmir Restaurant, that spread throughout Rapture. Ryan in turn began splicing his own forces, and his paranoia had reached such a level he was hanging dozens of people, mostly innocent, in Rapture's Apollo Square. As the war disrupted production and supply, every ADAM user in the city eventually went violently insane. By the end of the 1959 revolt, Ryan's utopia had become a dystopia, and only a handful of non-mutated humans survive in barricaded hideouts. In the events of BioShock, a man known as Jack (the protagonist that the player controls) ends up in Rapture after a plane crash in the middle of the ocean leaves him close to the city's bathysphere surface terminus. In the course of the game, it is learned that Jack is Ryan's illegitimate son, and was purposely brought to Rapture to be used as a cat's paw against the founder by Fontaine/Atlas. When Jack finally meets Ryan, the latter is well aware of Jack's identity and mental conditioning, and orders Jack to kill him, ending his life on his own terms and rejecting the control Fontaine has over his son. Fontaine leaves Jack to die, but he is rescued by Tenenbaum and her Little Sisters, and together they attack and kill Fontaine. In the power void left by Ryan's and Fontaine's deaths, a new figure, Sofia Lamb, arises in the following decade. In contrast to Ryan's belief of empowering the individual, Lamb's ideals are favoring the collective, and she is able to build \\"The Family\\", a cult-like following of the remaining citizens of Rapture to achieve her goals. During the events of BioShock 2 (which takes place ten years after the events of the first game), the player takes the role of the first prototype Big Daddy, Subject Delta, as Lamb's plans progress to their final completion to extend The Family to the surface. The destinies of Delta, Lamb, and Eleanor, Lamb's daughter and Delta's original Little Sister, are determined by the player's action during the game, though the endings involve escaping a section of Rapture flooded by Lamb. The fate of Rapture is left open after the completion of the game. More details about the origins of Rapture are provided in the novel BioShock: Rapture, a prequel novel by John Shirley, released in 2011. The novel tells the backstory of the creation of Rapture, the underwater city's deterioration, and the civil war following the coming of plasmids. The novel ends shortly before the story in the first BioShock game begins. The novel was originally called BioShock: the Rise and Fall of the Ryan Empire. In the Burial at Sea expansion for Bioshock Infinite, Burial at Sea begins with Booker Dewitt (Troy Baker) as a private investigator in Rapture. On the eve of the Rapture civil war, Elizabeth (Courtnee Draper) asks him to investigate the disappearance of a young girl named Sally. Elizabeth reveals that Sally is alive, and that a local artist named Sander Cohen (T. Ryder Smith) may have information regarding her whereabouts. Throughout the course of the DLC, many details surrounding Atlas' rebellion, the link between Columbia and Rapture, and the link between Big Daddies and Little Sisters are revealed.  Reception  In reviews for BioShock, many reviewers praised the representation of Rapture. Charles Herold of The New York Times wrote that the city was \\"a fascinating creation\\" and that there was something \\"both wonderful and disturbing\\" in exploring the ruins of Andrew Ryan's creation.

The company was established in 1889. The Jones family has owned and operated the business since its establishment by Milo C. Jones.  History  In 1832, Milo Jones, a government surveyor, moved from Vermont to Fort Atkinson with his wife and two children, to establish a traditional dairy farm. This small family farm produced primarily cheese, but also raised pigs for their own consumption. In 1849, Milo C. Jones was born and soon joined his family in working the farm. At the age of 35 the younger Jones developed rheumatoid arthritis and was unable to continue working on the farm, however in 1889, with the family facing financial difficulty, he decided to begin a sausage-making enterprise in the family's cheese room using his mother's traditional family recipe that had been brought from Vermont. Milo Jr.'s sausage production technique was unique at the time: instead of pork trimmings, he made his sausage using ham, loin, and shoulder cuts. Milo Jr. began selling his sausage to Wisconsin grocers, neighbors and friends, but quickly expanded into large markets, such as Chicago, New York City and Boston, and began delivering product by rail. Unlike most sausage makers of the day, Milo advertised heavily. This advertising originated with direct mail, and expanded to national magazines like Saturday Evening Post, Literary Digest and Good Housekeeping as early as 1903. Jones Dairy Farm established a number of industry firsts. In the 1920s Jones was the first meatpacking company to quick-freeze sausage, which allowed shipping throughout the United States and abroad without the need for chemical preservatives. The company was also the first to introduce a line of fully cooked breakfast sausage and one of the first to offer a ‚Äúlight‚Äù breakfast sausage product. Jones also became one of the first meatpacking companies to operate a modern bacteriological laboratory on-site to monitor and test food safety. The company is one of a handful of companies (and the only privately owned company) that meets the standards of the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation, a nonprofit public service dedicated to the formal recognition of testing laboratories, inspection bodies and proficiency testing. After Milo C. Jones Jr.'s death in 1919, he was succeeded as president by his daughter, Mary. She was followed by her nephew, Alan Jones, in 1960 and then by his brother Edward Jones in the 1970s. Alan's son, Milo C. Jones III became president in 1983. Edward C. Jones, Jr. (son of Edward) became the seventh president in 1995 and his son Philip Jones, the great-great grandson of company founder Milo C., became president and CEO in 2001.  Location  Jones Dairy Farm is set on and encompasses the factory, crop fields, and the original farmhouse where Milo Jones I settled in 1843. On December 27, 1978, the property, except for the modern plant, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This includes the old post and beam barn built around 1839, a greenhouse built in the 1840s, and the horse barn built in the mid-19th century. Also included is the farmhouse begun in the 1840s and expanded in the 1860s, 1910, and 1922, the sausage kitchen added in 1907 (designed by D.I. Davis and Associates of Chicago), a Colonial Revival house built by one of the Jones sons in 1897, and another built in 1930. With  Products  In addition to the original breakfast sausage recipe, which has remained unchanged since 1889, Jones also produces hams, bacon, Canadian bacon, liver sausage and scrapple for both retail and foodservice customers. These are sold both in traditional supermarkets and grocery stores, as well as by special order from the company's website. Jones Dairy Farm owns scrapple producers Habbersett and Rapa.  Sponsorships  Jones offers a number of products certified gluten-free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization, a program of the Gluten Intolerance Group, of whom they are a sponsor. Jones also promotes awareness of celiac disease by sponsoring the Celiac Disease Foundation and is a benefactor member of the Celiac Sprue Association. In 2015, Jones sponsored an annual scholarship for culinary students at Pennsylvania College of Technology.

Reign Domnall M√≥r's reign is one of the most obscure of the High Medieval kings of U√≠ Maine. The kingdom is only indirectly mentioned in the annals, while the Ua Conchobair succession dispute regularly devastated Connacht and the Anglo-Irish began raids and settlement west of the Shannon. Descendants Domnall M√≥r is notable for the claim, noted by John O'Donovan as recorded in a Trinity College Dublin pedigree of the Mac Eochadha (Keogh) family, that he was the common ancestor of all the extant branches of the U√≠ Cellaigh U√≠ Maine. This may simply mean that, while other lines had lost lands and status and became peasants, most of his bloodline continued to exist among the gentry after the collapse of Gaelic Ireland. It further states that he was the ancestor of all subsequent kings and chiefs, bar four. Domnall M√≥r married Dubh Cobhlaigh N√≠ Briain, a daughter of King Domnall M√≥r of Thomond (died 1194). According to later genealogies, this made his children first-cousins of Richard Mor de Burgh, who began the encastellation of Connaught c. 1237. Children of Domnall M√≥r and Dubh Cobhlaigh included: * - Eoghan, the third son, became ancestor of the Clann Maince Eoghain, who gave their name to the barony of Clanmacnowen, and whose chiefs were semi-independent vassals of the senior Ua Cellaigh. * - Diarmaid, their youngest son, became ancestor of the Mac Eochadha (Keogh) family of Maigh Finn (now Taughmaconnell). This surname is still found in County Roscommon and County Galway.

Biography  Alder was born in Duisburg, Germany in September 1925, to Jewish parents, a chemist and a homemaker. After the Nazis came to power, the family moved to Zurich, Switzerland. Fearing invasion by Nazi Germany after the outbreak of World War Two, the family applied for a visa to the United States, which was granted in 1941. They left by sealed train from neutral Switzerland to (formally neutral) Spain, then to Portugal, where they took a ship to the US. Following a stint in the US Navy after US entry into the war, he obtained a B.Sc. in chemistry from the University of California at Berkeley and a master's degree in chemical engineering from the same institution in 1947. He went to the California Institute of Technology to study under John Gamble Kirkwood for his PhD in 1948 and worked for the investigation of phase transitions in hard-sphere gas with Stan Frankel, where he got the idea to use the Monte Carlo method. After he finished at Caltech in 1952, he went to Berkeley and worked part-time at Berkeley to teach chemistry and part-time as a consultant under suggestion of Edward Teller in the nuclear weapons program for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to help with the equations of state. In collaboration with Thomas Everett Wainwright, he developed techniques for molecular dynamics simulation in the mid-1950s, including the liquid-solid phase transition for hard sphere and the velocity autocorrelations function decay in liquids. In the late 1950s, together, they began conducting computer simulations of idealized molecular dynamics of 2D hard spheres to investigate transitions between solids, liquids and gasses. In 1967 they observed long-time tails not expected from existing calculations, and although it was realized that these were a consequence of fluid-like behavior not readily accounted for in purely microscopic approximations, it did not seem plausible that large-scale fluid phenomena could be investigated with molecular dynamics. Alder, along with Teller, was one of the founders of the Department of Applied Science in 1963. He was a professor of Applied Science at the University of California at Davis, and later professor emeritus. In 2001, he was awarded the Boltzmann Medal for inventing technique of molecular dynamics simulation. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008. In 2009, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. Alder was a Guggenheim Fellow. He was the editor of the book series Methods in Computational Physics and the founder of the magazine Computing.

The foundation stone of St. Anne's Library was laid in August 1904 and the building was officially opened on 10 January 1906. The land was given by the St. Anne's on the Sea Land and Building Company, and Andrew Carnegie paid for the building itself. This was the first library in the town. There is also a library at Lytham. The library was administered by the St Anne's on the Sea Urban District until 1922 when the Urban District Council amalgamated with Lytham U.D.C. to form the municipal borough of Lytham St. Annes. The Borough continued to operate the service until 1974 when the Library Service was taken over by Lancashire County Council and became the District Central Library of Fylde District.  The development and opening of the building  Councillor L S Stott, Chairman of St Anne's on the Sea Urban District Council had been in communication with the American Philanthropist and benefactor of public libraries, Andrew Carnegie and Council Minutes (General Purposes Committee) of 29 June 1903 report that he received \\"an intimation from Mr Carnegie's private secretary that he would give the sum of ¬£3,500 for the erection of a library\\".Urban District of St Anne's on the Sea, Proceedings of the Urban District Council 1903-04, St Anne's on the Sea, pp. 91-92 The offer was gratefully accepted and a sub committee was appointed to consider a suitable site for the library. A number of options were considered including a site on St Annes Road East but the offer of a site on Clifton Drive South from the Land and Building Company was eventually settled on. In October 1903 architects were invited to submit designs for the library ‚Äì the total cost was not to exceed ¬£3,500. Mr John Dent Harker of St Anne's won the contract and was appointed as the architect and in March 1904 the tender for the building was awarded to Mr Samuel Wilson also of St Anne's. The building process wasn't without difficulty and the Council experienced some problems with the building contractor. The Council Minutes (Library and Baths Committee) of 30 October 1905 note that \\"...the Architect submitted correspondence which had taken place between himself and the Contractor with reference to the great delay there has been in completing the Library building; he also reported that he had given the Contractor seven days notice to complete the work, and that the Contractor had commenced on the last day of the notice to proceed to complete the work.\\",Urban District of St Anne's on the Sea, Proceedings of the Urban District Council 1905-06, St Anne's on the Sea, p.219 Bust of Sir Walter Scott in the Entrance Hall of St Anne's Library These problems were, however, overcome and St. Annes Library was opened on Wednesday 10 January 1906, the official ceremony being performed by Councillor George Walters Spring, J.P. The land was given by the Land and Building Company and Andrew Carnegie paid for the building itself. This description of the building comes from the St Anne's on the Sea Express of 10 January 1906 - \\"It is convenient and effective in arrangements and presents an imposing appearance. The style is an adaptation of Victorian Renaissance‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The main entrance leads through to a vestibule to a large octagonal hall. Lighted by clerestory windows and surmounted by a domed roof. On the right side of the entrance hall is a niche containing a bust of Sir Walter Scott.\\",The St Annes on the Sea Express, 10 Jan 1906, p.5, col. c Pevsner's Buildings of England - Lancashire:North describes the building as \\".....every inch the early 20C Carnegie Library. Low, Baroque of red brick and buff terracotta with a corner entrance flanked by tiny oculi and an octagonal domed tower rising behind. Light and airy inside, with a range of low arches to one side and friendly bays on the other\\".Clare Hartwell and Nikolaus Pevsner (2009), The buildings of England - Lancashire: North, Yale University Press, p.445 In the Library's first Annual Report submitted in July 1907, it states that prior to 1 April 1906, 1500 borrowers' tickets had been issued although \\"a large proportion were not generally in use\\". In the subsequent year, another 637 had been issued to bring the total to 2137. The number of books issued in the year ending Mar 1907 was 48,468 ‚Äì the vast majority of those being fiction. A writer for the St Anne's on the Sea Express might have remarked on this. In the article on the opening of the Library on 10 January 1906, it was commented that \\"The reading of novels is not calculated to bring out the best that is in men and women\\" which was reason for also stocking the library with volumes that might benefit the more \\"serious side\\" of mankind, such as \\"Books treating of poetry, travel, social science, political economy, natural history, philosophy etc.\\"The St Anne's on the Sea Express, 10 Jan 1906, p.5, col. c In the years after the opening of the building the service expanded and by 1929 an extension was thought to be urgently required. The council were granted permission to borrow ¬£2,000 to carry out the building in April 1930 and in March 1931 tenders for the work were accepted. The building work was carried out by John Heap and Sons of St Anne's and the constructional steelwork by John Booth and Sons of Hulton Steelworks, Bolton. The extension was opened on 25 September 1932 and a reorganised lending department opened on 9 October 1931.  Library Staff  Bertha Barrow and Library Assistants,January 1927 The first Librarian in charge, appointed in July 1905, was a Mr T P Thompson who had come from Bolton where he had worked at the Bolton Free Library for 14 years. By March 1906, however, he had been replaced by Miss Bertha M Barrow. The minutes of the Library and Baths Committee of the Council reports that after his resignation, her appointment was accepted on 26 February 1906 at a salary of ¬£60 per annum. The minutes state that it was resolved \\"That a lady librarian be appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr T. P Thompson\\". The St Anne's on the Sea Express of 7 March 1906 tells us that \\"Miss Barrow was an applicant when the council advertised last year, but the committee had, at that time, resolved to appoint a male librarian. The committee therefore knew her qualifications and for that reason the vacant post was not again advertised. The Council, we believe, will not regret their choice.\\"The St Anne's on the Sea Express, 7 March 1906, p.4, col. d The Express also commented that as at that time 70% of those who attended St Annes Library were women the appointment was especially appropriate. She found an eloquent champion in the Express - on 18 April 1906, after she had reorganised the library it commented that \\" ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Miss Barrow has great reason to feel proud of all that she has accomplished in such a short space of time\\". An enlightened position for the newspaper in an age when women hadn't yet achieved the vote and although, the 1901 census shows that over 30% of women over the age of 10 were in paid employment, 80% of those were in domestic service,http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/census/living/making/women.htm other services or manufacturing. At the time less than 9% of working women were in the professions let alone in a management position.https://web.archive.org/web/20120223115439/http://www.ngfl- cymru.org.uk/vtc/20050331/history/Keystage4/women/womenande/whatjobsd/ Miss Barrow actually served the people of St Anne's for over 30 years and retired from her post just before the start of World War II in August 1939. Bertha Barrow was succeeded by Graham Leslie Parish from Sheffield who was 26 at the time of his appointment and was chosen from 50 applicants. His tenure in the post was cut short due to his death in World War Two. Graham Parish, Lytham St Annes Borough Librarian, appointed in 1939 After the outbreak of war he joined the RAF and in September 1942 he was a navigator on a delivery flight to the Middle East command. When the plane was forced down on rough ground at a Sudan airfield it hit a building and burst into flames. Although the crew escaped unhurt Sergeant Parish went back for a passenger they were carrying, a Sudan government meteorologist called Mr J Flower. Both men were killed in the blazing plane. In April 1943 Graham Parish was awarded the George Cross posthumously for his brave and selfless actions and \\"gallantry of the highest order\\". The Times of 3 April 1943 reported \\"As the passenger could not walk, owing to his broken legs, it is clear that Sgt. Parish had carried him from the emergency door to the rear turret in the hope that both could escape through the turret. Sgt Parish could have escaped through the astro-hatch but his unselfish desire to assist the passenger cost him his life\\",The Times, 3 April 1943, p.4, col. f  References   Bibliography  *Lytham St Annes Civic Society (2006), The listed buildings of Lytham St Annes. *Peter Shakeshaft(2008), St Anne's on the Sea: a history, Carnegie Publishing. *St Anne's on the Sea Urban District Council, Minutes of Proceedings of the St Anne's on the Sea Urban District Council - various dates noted in text. *St Anne's on the Sea Express - Various dates noted in text. *The Times - Date noted in text. *Lancashire Library, Fylde District (c1970), St Annes Carnegie Library: in the beginning - Duplicated typescript *Clare Hartwell and Nikolaus Pevsner (2009), The buildings of England - Lancashire: North, Yale University Press.

Navarro sang as a tenor in the choir of the Duke of Arcos in Marchena (by 1549, when Crist√≥bal de Morales was chapel-master), then in the cathedrals of Ja√©n and M√°laga. In 1553 he competed for the position of maestro de capilla in M√°laga left vacant by the death of Morales, a competition won by Francisco Guerrero. In 1563 he was appointed maestro de capilla of the Cathedral of Avila, then in 1566 of Salamanca where he was appointed without being required to compete for the post.

It is a large wooden hotel built near the end of the 19th century. It was built as a lodge for anglers coming to fly fish for trout in the nearby Beaver Kill. It is one of the few fishing lodges remaining from that era of resort development remaining in the Catskills, and the only one along the upper Beaver Kill. In 1985 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the westernmost property in the county with that distinction. Property The inn property is a mostly rectangular parcel along Barnhart Road bordered by the Beaver Kill on the south and west, along the stream's flood plain at the foot of a wooded hillside near the Delaware County line, at an elevation of above sea level. There are several other outbuildings and recreational resources on the property besides the inn. All are of recent construction or have been extensively altered from their original appearance; only the inn and the property's section of the river are considered contributing resources. The main building is a two-story L-shaped frame structure with gabled roof shingled in asphalt and pierced by large gabled dormers with two windows each. It is topped with a cupola with flared hipped roof and louvered arched vents. Siding is clapboard giving way to wood shingles in the gable fields. A shed-roofed veranda, rounded at the northeast corner, supported by square pillars with simple capitals runs the length of the north, south and east elevations. It is broken by stairways at the center of the six-bay east (front) facade, the eastern end of the south, and a porte- coch√®re on the north. A railing of square-sawn members also runs the length of the porch; spheres on newel posts are the only decoration. All windows are flanked with louvered shutters Three single-story wings have been added to the building. The south one takes in an enclosed portion of the veranda and serves as the manager's apartment. The north one houses the kitchen, with a former porch now enclosed to create more space. A west wing with shed dormers on the roof and a deck at the end provides lounge space for guests. Inside, a central hall is flanked by sitting rooms on the front and the dining room, reception area on the rear with the stairs. The sitting rooms have their original oak trim and brick-and-stone fireplaces. The dining room has the original trim as well, with a new bay window added to let more natural light in. The original turned oak spindlework and balustrade remain on the stairs. Upstairs, the rooms on the second floor have been enlarged to allow the installation of private bathrooms. The rooms on the third floor are their original size; the shared bathrooms have been enlarged. The original window trim remains on both. The basement has been finished for use as a laundry and game room. Near the house are two attached frame barns dating to the property's original construction but enlarged today for use as conference rooms and support facilities for an added swimming pool. A wooded area up the hill screens the inn's tennis courts. A new springhouse up Barnhart Road replaced a dilapidated original. Hiking trails and footpaths have been built around the property to connect all these facilities and offer their own recreational possibilities. History The combination of minimal arable land, remoteness and continuing land disputes over the Hardenburgh Patent kept the upper Beaverkill Valley from being settled for the first half of the 19th century. The trout in its streams were taken by the few loggers, trappers and (later) tanners who headed up it primarily as food rather than recreation. Their abundance had been written about by Washington Irving as early as 1819, when angling was just beginning to take hold as a recreational activity in the United States. In 1838 The American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine wrote that the Beaver Kill along with Callicoon and Willowemoc creeks were \\"the three finest trout streams in this country; they are comparatively unknown to city anglers and less fished than any others of like pretension within our knowledge.\\" The Erie Railroad, and later the Ontario and Western, finally made that region of the Catskills more accessible to city anglers in the later half of the century; they began coming in great numbers. With the decline of the tanning industry and the creation of the state Forest Preserve in the 1880s, tourism, in the form of visiting fishermen, became the main industry in the southwestern Catskills. Those fishermen in turn developed the uniquely American technique of dry-fly trout fishing, epitomized in the writings of area resident Theodore Gordon, known in later years as the father of American dry-fly fishing. In the 1895‚Äì1915 period, Gordon and other pioneers developed the art of fly tying. Early rod builders perfected the split bamboo fly rod. A community of anglers developed around the Beaverkill and other Catskill rivers, in and out of the private clubs they established to preserve exclusive rights to river frontage. Their lore named pools and bends. They stocked and protected and preserved them. In later years they helped prevent the damming of the Beaverkill and Willowemoc for New York City reservoirs. Hotels and other accommodations were built to cater to sport fishermen during those years, regarded as a golden age of Catskill fly fishing. Three remain today ‚Äî Antrim Lodge and the Central House in Roscoe, the center of recreational fishing in the Catskills, and the Beaverkill Valley Inn, founded in 1895 as the Bonnie View by a local married couple. Its architecture is typical of the late Victorian architectural styles of its time, with comforts such as its veranda and fireplaces that an affluent male urban guest would have appreciated, built specifically as a fisherman's hotel. In the early 1980s, new owners renovated the outbuildings, added other recreational facilities and renamed it the Beaverkill Valley Inn. Of the 18 hotels, farmhouses or rooming houses that had fishermen as guests along the upper Beaverkill (above Roscoe), it is the only one intact and in continuous operation today.

Shanghai Metro is the second largest rapid transit system in the world by route length, after Beijing Metro. The Port Vell Aerial Tramway in Barcelona, Spain Public transport (also known as public transportation, public transit, mass transit, or simply transit) is a system of transport, in contrast to private transport, for passengers by group travel systems available for use by the general public, typically managed on a schedule, operated on established routes, and that charge a posted fee for each trip. Examples of public transport include city buses, trolleybuses, trams (or light rail) and passenger trains, rapid transit (metro/subway/underground, etc.) and ferries. Public transport between cities is dominated by airlines, coaches, and intercity rail. High-speed rail networks are being developed in many parts of the world. Most public transport systems run along fixed routes with set embarkation/disembarkation points to a prearranged timetable, with the most frequent services running to a headway (e.g.: \\"every 15 minutes\\" as opposed to being scheduled for any specific time of the day). However, most public transport trips include other modes of travel, such as passengers walking or catching bus services to access train stations. Share taxis offer on-demand services in many parts of the world, which may compete with fixed public transport lines, or complement them, by bringing passengers to interchanges. Paratransit is sometimes used in areas of low demand and for people who need a door-to-door service. Urban public transit differs distinctly among Asia, North America, and Europe. In Asia, profit-driven, privately owned and publicly traded mass transit and real estate conglomerates predominantly operate public transit systems. In North America, municipal transit authorities most commonly run mass transit operations. In Europe, both state-owned and private companies predominantly operate mass transit systems, Public transport services can be profit-driven by use of pay-by-the-distance fares or funded by government subsidies in which flat rate fares are charged to each passenger. Services can be fully profitable through high usership numbers and high farebox recovery ratios, or can be regulated and possibly subsidised from local or national tax revenue. Fully subsidised, free of charge services operate in some towns and cities. For geographical, historical and economic reasons, differences exist internationally regarding use and extent of public transport. While countries in the Old World tend to have extensive and frequent systems serving their old and dense cities, many cities of the New World have more sprawl and much less comprehensive public transport. The International Association of Public Transport (UITP) is the international network for public transport authorities and operators, policy decision-makers, scientific institutes and the public transport supply and service industry. It has 3,400 members from 92 countries from all over the globe. History Early trolley car in Newton, Massachusetts Conveyances designed for public hire are as old as the first ferries, and the earliest public transport was water transport: on land people walked (sometimes in groups and on pilgrimages, as noted in sources such as the Bible and The Canterbury Tales) or (at least in Eurasia and Africa) rode an animal.In the Americas and Oceania, beasts of burden were generally not as large, although the Incas did use llamas as pack animals. See Pre Columbian Wheels. Ferries appear in Greek mythology‚Äîcorpses in ancient Greece were buried with a coin underneath their tongue to pay the ferryman Charon to take them to Hades. Some historical forms of public transport include the stagecoach, traveling a fixed route between coaching inns, and the horse-drawn boat carrying paying passengers, which was a feature of European canals from their 17th-century origins. The canal itself as a form of infrastructure dates back to antiquity ‚Äì ancient Egyptians certainly used a canal for freight transportation to bypass the Aswan cataract ‚Äì and the Chinese also built canals for water transportation as far back as the Warring States periodNeedham, Joseph. (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 3, Civil Engineering and Nautics. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. which began in the 5th century BCE. Whether or not those canals were used for for-hire public transport remains unknown; the Grand Canal in China (begun in 486 BCE) served primarily for shipping grain. The omnibus, the first organized public transit system within a city, appears to have originated in Paris, France, in 1662,web-page (in French) at http://www.herodote.net/histoire/evenement.php?jour=18260810 . Retrieved 13 June 2008. although the service in question, Carrosses √† cinq sols, failed a few months after its founder, Blaise Pascal, died in August 1662; omnibuses are next known to have appeared in Nantes, France, in 1826. The omnibus was introduced to London in July 1829. The first passenger horse-drawn railway opened in 1806: it ran between Swansea and Mumbles in southwest Wales in the United Kingdom. In 1825 George Stephenson built the Locomotion for the Stockton and Darlington Railway in northeast England, the first public steam railway in the world. The first successful electric streetcar was built for 12 miles of track for the Union Passenger Railway in Richmond, Virginia in 1888. Electric streetcars could carry heavier passenger loads than predecessors, which reduced fares and stimulated greater transit use. Two years after the Richmond success, over thirty two thousand electric streetcars were operating in America. Electric streetcars also paved the way for the first subway system in America. Before electric streetcars, steam powered subways were considered. However, most people believed that riders would avoid the smoke filled subway tunnels from the steam engines. In 1894, Boston built the first subway in the United States, an electric streetcar line in a 1.5-mile tunnel under Tremont Street's retail district. Other cities such as New York quickly followed, constructing hundreds of miles of subway in the following decades.

The criteria are speed, comfort, safety, cost, proximity, timeliness and directness. Speed is calculated from total journey time including transfers. Proximity means how far passengers must walk or otherwise travel before they can begin the public transport leg of their journey and how close it leaves them to their desired destination. Timeliness is how long they must wait for the vehicle. Directness records how far a journey using public transport deviates from the route. In selecting between competing modes of transport, many individuals are strongly motivated by direct cost (travel fare/ ticket price to them) and convenience, as well as being informed by habit. The same individual may accept the lost time and statistically higher risk of accident in private transport, together with the initial, running and parking costs. Loss of control, spatial constriction, overcrowding, high speeds/accelerations, height and other phobias may discourage use of public transport. Actual travel time on public transport becomes a lesser consideration when predictable and when travel itself is reasonably comfortable (seats, toilets, services), and can thus be scheduled and used pleasurably, productively or for (overnight) rest. Chauffeured movement is enjoyed by many people when it is relaxing, safe but not too monotonous. Waiting, interchanging, stops and holdups, for example due to traffic or for security, are discomforting. Jet lag is a human constraint discouraging frequent rapid long-distance east‚Äìwest commuting, favoring modern telecommunications and VR technologies. Airline An airline provides scheduled service with aircraft between airports. Air travel has high speeds, but incurs large waiting times prior to and after travel, and is therefore often only feasible over longer distances or in areas where a lack of ground infrastructure makes other modes of transport impossible. Bush airlines work more similarly to bus stops; an aircraft waits for passengers and takes off when the aircraft is full. Bus and coach Transperth bus operating in Perth, Western Australia Oxford Tube body on chassis vehicles at the Buckingham Palace Road terminus Bus services use buses on conventional roads to carry numerous passengers on shorter journeys. Buses operate with low capacity (compared with trams or trains), and can operate on conventional roads, with relatively inexpensive bus stops to serve passengers. Therefore, buses are commonly used in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas, and for shuttle services supplementing other means of transit in large cities. Bus rapid transit is an ambiguous term used for buses operating on dedicated right-of-way, much like a light rail. Trolleybuses are electric buses that receive power from overhead wires for mobility. Online Electric Vehicles are buses that run on a conventional battery, but are recharged frequently at certain points via underground wires. Coach services use coaches (long- distance buses) for suburb-to-CBD or longer-distance transportation. The vehicles are normally equipped with more comfortable seating, a separate luggage compartment, video and possibly also a toilet. They have higher standards than city buses, but a limited stopping pattern. Train 3 different types of trains (U-Bahn, S-Bahn and regional/long-distance trains) in Hamburg, Germany A Washington Metro Green Line train arriving at College Park‚ÄìUniversity of Maryland station in College Park, Maryland Passenger rail transport is the conveyance of passengers by means of wheeled vehicles specially designed to run on railways. Trains allow high capacity on short or long distance, but require track, signalling, infrastructure and stations to be built and maintained. Urban rail transit consists of trams, light rail, rapid transit, people movers, commuter rail, monorail, suspension railways and funiculars. Commuter, intercity, and high-speed rail A SEPTA Regional Rail train in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, a form of commuter rail Commuter rail is part of an urban area's public transport; it provides faster services to outer suburbs and neighboring towns and villages. Trains stop at stations that are located to serve a smaller suburban or town center. The stations are often combined with shuttle bus or park and ride systems. Frequency may be up to several times per hour, and commuter rail systems may either be part of the national railway or operated by local transit agencies. Intercity rail is long-haul passenger services that connect multiple urban areas. They have few stops, and aim at high average speeds, typically only making one of a few stops per city. These services may also be international. High-speed rail is passenger trains operating significantly faster than conventional rail‚Äîtypically defined as at least . The most predominant systems have been built in Europe and East Asia, and compared with air travel, offer long- distance rail journeys as quick as air services, have lower prices to compete more effectively and use electricity instead of combustion. Rapid transit SkyTrain in Vancouver is the longest rapid transit system in Canada. A rapid transit railway system (also called a metro, underground, or subway) operates in an urban area with high capacity and frequency, and grade separation from other traffic.; Systems are able to transport large numbers of people quickly over short distances with little land use. Variations of rapid transit include people movers, small-scale light metro and the commuter rail hybrid S-Bahn. More than 160 cities have rapid transit systems, totalling more than of track and 7,000 stations. Twenty-five cities have systems under construction. Tram streetcar in Toronto, which operates the largest tramway in North America Trams are railborne vehicles that run in city streets or dedicated tracks. They have higher capacity than buses, but must follow dedicated infrastructure with rails and wires either above or below the track, limiting their flexibility. Light rail Light rail is a modern development (and use) of the tram, with dedicated right-of-way not shared with other traffic, (often) step-free access and increased speed. Light rail lines are, thus, essentially modernized interurbans. Personal rapid transit People mover vehicle of Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit Personal rapid transit is an automated cab service that runs on rails or a guideway. This is an uncommon mode of transportation (excluding elevators) due to the complexity of automation. A fully implemented system might provide most of the convenience of individual automobiles with the efficiency of public transit. The crucial innovation is that the automated vehicles carry just a few passengers, turn off the guideway to pick up passengers (permitting other PRT vehicles to continue at full speed), and drop them off to the location of their choice (rather than at a stop). Conventional transit simulations show that PRT might attract many auto users in problematic medium-density urban areas. A number of experimental systems are in progress. One might compare personal rapid transit to the more labor-intensive taxi or paratransit modes of transportation, or to the (by now automated) elevators common in many publicly accessible areas. Cable-propelled transit Cable-propelled transit (CPT) is a transit technology that moves people in motor-less, engine- less vehicles that are propelled by a steel cable.‚Äì The Gondola Project Basic Lesson 1: What is Cable Propelled Transit Retrieved on 7 November 2009 There are two sub-groups of CPT ‚Äì gondola lifts and cable cars (railway). Gondola lifts are supported and propelled from above by cables, whereas cable cars are supported and propelled from below by cables. Gulmarg Gondola in Gulmarg, India While historically associated with usage in ski resorts, gondola lifts are now finding increased consumption and utilization in many urban areas ‚Äì built specifically for the purposes of mass transit.‚Äì Planetizen South America Incubates Cable Propelled Transit Retrieved on 10 June 2010 Many, if not all, of these systems are implemented and fully integrated within existing public transportation networks. Examples include Metrocable (Medell√≠n), Metrocable (Caracas), Portland Aerial Tram, Roosevelt Island Tramway in New York City, and London's Emirates Air Line. Ferry Water bus (vaporetto) of Venice, Italy A ferry is a boat used to carry (or ferry) passengers, and sometimes their vehicles, across a body of water. A foot-passenger ferry with many stops is sometimes called a water bus. Ferries form a part of the public transport systems of many waterside cities and islands, allowing direct transit between points at a capital cost much lower than bridges or tunnels, though at a lower speed. Ship connections of much larger distances (such as over long distances in water bodies like the Mediterranean Sea) may also be called ferry services. Cycleway network A report published by the UK National Infrastructure Commission in 2018 states that \\"cycling is mass transit and must be treated as such.\\" Cycling infrastructure is normally provided without charge to users because it is cheaper to operate than mechanised transit systems that use sophisticated equipment and do not use human power. Cycle Superhighway CS6 is part of Central London's Cycle Network mass transit infrastructure Operation Timelapse video of Downtown Seattle from atop a Community Transit double-decker bus Infrastructure All public transport runs on infrastructure, either on roads, rail, airways or seaways. The infrastructure can be shared with other modes, freight and private transport, or it can be dedicated to public transport. The latter is especially valuable in cases where there are capacity problems for private transport. Investments in infrastructure are expensive and make up a substantial part of the total costs in systems that are new or expanding. Once built, the infrastructure will require operating and maintenance costs, adding to the total cost of public transport. Sometimes governments subsidize infrastructure by providing it free of charge, just as is common with roads for automobiles. Interchanges Interchanges are locations where passengers can switch from one public transport route to another. This may be between vehicles of the same mode (like a bus interchange), or e.g. between bus and train. It can be between local and intercity transport (such as at a central station or airport). Cycle rickshaw in Kandirpar, Bangladesh Timetables Timetables (or 'schedules' in North American English) are provided by the transport operator to allow users to plan their journeys. They are often supplemented by maps and fare schemes to help travelers coordinate their travel. Online public transport route planners help make planning easier. Mobile apps are available for multiple transit systems that provide timetables and other service information and, in some cases, allow ticket purchase, some allowing to plan your journey, with time fares zones e.g. Services are often arranged to operate at regular intervals throughout the day or part of the day (known as clock-face scheduling). Often, more frequent services or even extra routes are operated during the morning and evening rush hours. Coordination between services at interchange points is important to reduce the total travel time for passengers. This can be done by coordinating shuttle services with main routes, or by creating a fixed time (for instance twice per hour) when all bus and rail routes meet at a station and exchange passengers. There is often a potential conflict between this objective and optimising the utilisation of vehicles and drivers. Financing The main sources of financing are ticket revenue, government subsidies and advertising. The percentage of revenue from passenger charges is known as the farebox recovery ratio. A limited amount of income may come from land development and rental income from stores and vendors, parking fees, and leasing tunnels and rights-of-way to carry fiber optic communication lines. Fare and ticketing A contactless ticket validator used in Moscow, Russia The SmartRider is a smart card for public transportation tickets in Perth, Western Australia Most‚Äîbut not all‚Äîpublic transport requires the purchase of a ticket to generate revenue for the operators. Tickets may be bought either in advance, or at the time of the journey, or the carrier may allow both methods. Passengers may be issued with a paper ticket, a metal or plastic token, or a magnetic or electronic card (smart card, contactless smart card). Sometimes a ticket has to be validated, e.g. a paper ticket has to be stamped, or an electronic ticket has to be checked in. Tickets may be valid for a single (or return) trip, or valid within a certain area for a period of time (see transit pass). The fare is based on the travel class, either depending on the traveled distance, or based on zone pricing. The tickets may have to be shown or checked automatically at the station platform or when boarding, or during the ride by a conductor. Operators may choose to control all riders, allowing sale of the ticket at the time of ride. Alternatively, a proof-of-payment system allows riders to enter the vehicles without showing the ticket, but riders may or may not be controlled by a ticket controller; if the rider fails to show proof of payment, the operator may fine the rider at the magnitude of the fare. Multi- use tickets allow travel more than once. In addition to return tickets, this includes period cards allowing travel within a certain area (for instance month cards), or during a given number of days that can be chosen within a longer period of time (for instance eight days within a month). Passes aimed at tourists, allowing free or discounted entry at many tourist attractions, typically include zero-fare public transport within the city. Period tickets may be for a particular route (in both directions), or for a whole network. A free travel pass allowing free and unlimited travel within a system is sometimes granted to particular social sectors, for example students, elderly, children, employees (job ticket) and the physically or mentally disabled. Zero-fare public transport services are funded in full by means other than collecting a fare from passengers, normally through heavy subsidy or commercial sponsorship by businesses. Several mid-size European cities and many smaller towns around the world have converted their entire bus networks to zero-fare. The only European capital with free public transport is Tallinn. Local zero-fare shuttles or inner-city loops are far more common than city- wide systems. There are also zero-fare airport circulators and university transportation systems. Revenue, profit and subsidies Governments frequently opt to subsidize public transport for social, environmental or economic reasons. Common motivations include the desire to provide transport to people who are unable to use an automobile and to reduce congestion, land use and automobile emissions. Subsidies may take the form of direct payments for financially unprofitable services, but support may also include indirect subsidies. For example, the government may allow free or reduced-cost use of state-owned infrastructure such as railways and roads, to stimulate public transport's economic competitiveness over private transport, that normally also has free infrastructure (subsidized through such things as gas taxes). Other subsidies include tax advantages (for instance aviation fuel is typically not taxed), bailouts if companies that are likely to collapse (often applied to airlines) and reduction of competition through licensing schemes (often applied to taxis and airlines). Private transport is normally subsidized indirectly through free roads and infrastructure, as well as incentives to build car factories and, on occasion, directly via bailouts of automakers. Land development schemes may be initialized, where operators are given the rights to use lands near stations, depots, or tracks for property development. For instance, in Hong Kong, MTR Corporation Limited and KCR Corporation generate additional profits from land development to partially cover the cost of the construction of the urban rail system. Some supporters of mass transit believe that use of taxpayer capital to fund mass transit will ultimately save taxpayer money in other ways, and therefore, state-funded mass transit is a benefit to the taxpayer. Some research has supported this position,For examples, see http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_49.pdf and http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_34.pdf but the measurement of benefits and costs is a complex and controversial issue. A lack of mass transit results in more traffic, pollution, and road construction to accommodate more vehicles, all costly to taxpayers; providing mass transit will therefore alleviate these costs. (Perhaps, although right-wing think tanks disagree ) Safety and security LASD deputy and a police dog patrol a LA Metro light rail train Relative to other forms of transportation, public transit is safe (with a low crash risk) and secure (with low rates of crime).Todd Litman, A New Transit Safety Narrative , Journal of Public Transportation, Vol. 17, No. 4 (2014), pp. 114-134. The injury and death rate for public transit is roughly one-tenth that of automobile travel. A 2014 study noted that \\"residents of transit-oriented communities have about one- fifth the per capita crash casualty rate as in automobile-oriented communities\\" and that \\"Transit also tends to have lower overall crime rates than automobile travel, and transit improvements can help reduce overall crime risk by improving surveillance and economic opportunities for at-risk populations.\\" Although relatively safe and secure, public perceptions that transit systems are dangerous endure. A 2014 study stated that \\"Various factors contribute to the under-appreciation of transit safety benefits, including the nature of transit travel, dramatic news coverage of transit crashes and crimes, transit agency messages that unintentionally emphasize risks without providing information on its overall safety, and biased traffic safety analysis.\\" Some systems attract vagrants who use the stations or trains as sleeping shelters, though most operators have practices that discourage this.Needle et al., 1997: 10‚Äì13 Impact Accessibility Public transport is means of independent transport for individuals (without walking or bicycling) such as children too young to drive, the elderly without access to cars and the infirm such as wheelchair users. Kneeling buses, low-floor access boarding on buses and light rail has also enabled greater access for the disabled in mobility. In recent decades low-floor access has been incorporated into modern designs for vehicles. In economically deprived areas, public transport increases individual accessibility to transport where private means are unaffordable. Environmental The pink bus rapid transit of Metz uses a diesel-electric hybrid driving system, developed by Belgian Van Hool manufacturer. Although there is continuing debate as to the true efficiency of different modes of transportation, mass transit is generally regarded as significantly more energy efficient than other forms of travel. A 2002 study by the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute found that public transportation in the U.S uses approximately half the fuel required by cars, SUV's and light trucks. In addition, the study noted that \\"private vehicles emit about 95 percent more carbon monoxide, 92 percent more volatile organic compounds and about twice as much carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide than public vehicles for every passenger mile traveled\\".Lyndsey Layton, \\"Study Lists Mass Transit Benefits\\", The Washington Post, 17 July 2002, Page B05 Studies have shown that there is a strong inverse correlation between urban population density and energy consumption per capita, and that public transport could facilitate increased urban population densities, and thus reduce travel distances and fossil fuel consumption.Newman, 1999 Supporters of the green movement usually advocate public transportation, because it offers decreased airborne pollution compared to automobiles. A study conducted in Milan, Italy, in 2004 during and after a transportation strike serves to illustrate the impact that mass transportation has on the environment. Air samples were taken between 2 and 9 January, and then tested for methane, carbon monoxide, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), and other gases identified as harmful to the environment. The figure below is a computer simulation showing the results of the study \\"with 2 January showing the lowest concentrations as a result of decreased activity in the city during the holiday season. 9 January showed the highest NMHC concentrations because of increased vehicular activity in the city due to a public transportation strike.\\" Based on the benefits of public transport, the green movement has affected public policy. For example, the state of New Jersey released Getting to Work: Reconnecting Jobs with Transit.New Jersey Future. \\"Getting to Work: Reconnecting Jobs with Transit. \\" New Jersey Future.1 November 2008.New Jersey Environmental Digital Library. 7 December 2009 This initiative attempts to relocate new jobs into areas with higher public transportation accessibility. The initiative cites the use of public transportation as being a means of reducing traffic congestion, providing an economic boost to the areas of job relocation, and most importantly, contributing to a green environment by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Using public transportation can result in a reduction of an individual's carbon footprint. A single person, round trip by car can be replaced using public transportation and result in a net CO2 emissions reduction of per year.Public Transportation Reduces Greenhouse Gases and Conserves Energy. Using public transportation saves CO2 emissions in more ways than simply travel as public transportation can help to alleviate traffic congestion as well as promote more efficient land use. When all three of these are considered, it is estimated that 37 million metric tons of CO2 will be saved annually. Another study claims that using public transit instead of private in the U.S. in 2005 would have reduced CO2 emissions by 3.9 million metric tons and that the resulting traffic congestion reduction accounts for an additional 3.0 million metric tons of CO2 saved.Todd Davis; Monica Hale. \\"Public Transportation's Contribution to U.S. Greenhouse Gas Reduction.\\" Sept. 2007. p. 25 This is a total savings of about 6.9 million metric tons per year given the 2005 values. In order to compare energy impact of public transportation to private transportation, the amount of energy per passenger mile must be calculated. The reason that comparing the energy expenditure per person is necessary is to normalize the data for easy comparison. Here, the units are in per 100 p-km (read as person kilometer or passenger kilometer). In terms of energy consumption, public transportation is better than individual transport in a personal vehicle.David JC MacKay. \\"Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.\\" 2009. p. 120 www.withouthotair.com In England, bus and rail are popular methods of public transportation, especially in London. Rail provides rapid movement into and out of the city of London while busing helps to provide transport within the city itself. As of 2006‚Äì2007, the total energy cost of London's trains was 15 kWh per 100 p-km, about 5 times better than a personal car.David JC MacKay. \\"Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.\\" 2009. p. 121 www.withouthotair.com For busing in London, it was 32 kWh per 100 p-km, or about 2.5 times that of a personal car. This includes lighting, depots, inefficiencies due to capacity (i.e., the train or bus may not be operating at full capacity at all times), and other inefficiencies. Efficiencies of transport in Japan in 1999 were 68 kWh per 100 p-km for a personal car, 19 kWh per 100 p-km for a bus, 6 kWh per 100 p-km for rail, 51 kWh per 100 p-km for air, and 57 kWh per 100 p-km for sea. These numbers from either country can be used in energy comparison calculations or life cycle assessment calculations. Public transportation also provides an arena to test environmentally friendly fuel alternatives, such as hydrogen- powered vehicles. Swapping out materials to create lighter public transportation vehicles with the same or better performance will increase environmental friendliness of public transportation vehicles while maintaining current standards or improving them. Informing the public about the positive environmental effects of using public transportation in addition to pointing out the potential economic benefit is an important first step towards making a difference. Land use Traffic jam in S√£o Paulo, Brazil Dense areas with mixed-land uses promote daily public transport use while urban sprawl is associated with sporadic public transport use. A recent European multi-city survey found that dense urban environments, reliable and affordable public transport services, and limiting motorized vehicles in high density areas of the cities will help achieve much needed promotion of public transport use. Urban space is a precious commodity and public transport utilises it more efficiently than a car dominant society, allowing cities to be built more compactly than if they were dependent on automobile transport. If public transport planning is at the core of urban planning, it will also force cities to be built more compactly to create efficient feeds into the stations and stops of transport. This will at the same time allow the creation of centers around the hubs, serving passengers' daily commercial needs and public services. This approach significantly reduces urban sprawl. Public land planning for public transportation can be difficult but it is the State and Regional organizations that are responsible to planning and improving public transportation roads and routes. With public land prices booming, there must be a plan to using the land most efficiently for public transportation in order to create better transportation systems. Inefficient land use and poor planning leads to a decrease in accessibility to jobs, education, and health care. Societal The consequences for wider society and civic life, is public transport breaks down social and cultural barriers between people in public life. An important social role played by public transport is to ensure that all members of society are able to travel without walking or cycling, not just those with a driving license and access to an automobile‚Äîwhich include groups such as the young, the old, the poor, those with medical conditions, and people banned from driving. Automobile dependency is a name given by policy makers to places where those without access to a private vehicle do not have access to independent mobility. Above that, public transportation opens to its users the possibility of meeting other people, as no concentration is diverted from interacting with fellow-travelers due to any steering activities. Adding to the above-said, public transport becomes a location of inter-social encounters across all boundaries of social, ethnic and other types of affiliation. Economic Tram tunnel in Bratislava, Slovakia - a connection of embankment with a city centre Investment in public transport has secondary positive effects on the local economy, with between $4 and $9 of economic activity resulting from every dollar spent. Many businesses rely on access to a transit system, in particular in cities and countries where access to cars is less widespread, businesses which require large numbers of people going to a same place may not be able to accommodate a large number of cars (concert venues, sport stadia, airports, exhibitions centres,...), or businesses where people are not able to use a car (bars, hospitals, or industries in the tourism sector whose customers may not have their cars). Transit systems also have an effect on derived businesses: commercial websites have been founded, such as Hopstop.com, that give directions through mass transit systems; in some cities, such as London, products themed on the local transport system are a popular tourist souvenir. Research in the Washington, DC area shows that public transport does a better job of providing high-skill residents with access to high-skill jobs than it does mid-skill residents to mid-skill jobs and low-skill residents to low-skill jobs.

It marked the first step towards parliamentary control over the Company and centralised administration in India. Background By 1773, the East India Company was in dire financial straits.http://www.indhistory.com/regulating-act.html The Company was important to the British Empire because it was a monopoly trading company in India and in the east and many influential people were shareholders. The Company paid (the present-day (2015) equivalent is ¬£) annually to the government to maintain the monopoly but had been unable to meet its commitments since 1768 because of the loss of tea sales to America. About 85% of all the tea in America was smuggled Dutch tea. The East India Company owed money to both the Bank of England and the government: it had 15 million lbs ( million kg) of tea rotting in British warehouses and more en route from India. The Regulating Act 1773, was complemented by the Tea Act 1773, which had a principal objective that was to reduce the massive amount of tea held by the financially troubled British East India Company in its London warehouses and to help the financially struggling company survive. Lord North decided to overhaul the management of the India Company with the Regulating Act. This was the first step to the eventual government control of India. The Act set up a system whereby it supervised (regulated) the work of the East India Company. The Company had taken over large areas of India for trading purposes and had an army to protect its interests. Company men were not trained to govern so North's government began moves towards government control since India was of national importance. Shareholders in the Company opposed the Act. The East India Company was still a powerful lobbying group in Parliament in spite of its financial problems.The making of British India 1756-1858 Ramsay Muir page 133-39 Provisions of the Regulating Act *The Act limited Company dividends to 6% until it repaid a loan (passed by an accompanying act, 13 Geo. 3 c. 64) and restricted the Court of Directors to four-year terms. *First step taken by the British government to regulate and control the company‚Äôs affairs in India. *It prohibited the servants of company from engaging in any private trade or accepting presents or bribes from the \\"natives\\". *The Act elevated Governor of Bengal, Warren Hastings to Governor-General of Bengal and subsumed the presidencies of Madras and Bombay under Bengal's control. It laid the foundations for a centralized administration in India. Governor of Bengal became the Governor General of Bengal with an executive council of four to assist him. Decisions would be taken by majority and Governor General could only vote in case of tie. *The Act named four additional men to serve with the Governor-General on the Supreme Council of Bengal: Lt-Gen John Clavering, George Monson, Richard Barwell, and Philip Francis. *A supreme court was established at Fort William at Calcutta.

SAS intended to build its head office in the lake Brunnsviken area, near an exit to Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The plans caused controversy since the municipal and regional planners wanted the area to be used for recreation purposes. The Swedish government was about to sell land in the Brunnsviken area, and was interested in SAS having its main office in the area of Stockholm. So SAS took a plot of land, while the beaches and scenic elements of the area were retained. In 1984 SAS held a competition amongst nine architects to determine who would get to design the head office. Niels Torp won the competition and a complex was built.\\"SAS koncernbyggnad\\" (). Solna Municipality. Retrieved on 12 February 2010. When the building opened, there were 2,000 employees. Around 2010, SAS had reduced its space in the building due to reductions in staffing. Therefore, portions of the building were leased to other companies. Around 2010 the building owner, Nordisk Renting AB, decided to sell it to Norwegian KLP for 1.5 billion Swedish kronor. In 2010 SAS announced that it would relocate its head office to Stockholm-Arlanda Airport, with the move scheduled for the northern hemisphere autumn of that year. In 2013 SAS announced that it once again would relocate to Fr√∂sundavik, () partly because it was hard to find another user of the large custom made office building. Features The building has seven separate building blocks with a street, covered by a glass roof, connecting the corridors. The street is lined with shops and cafes. Jeremy Myerson, author of \\"After modernism: the contemporary office environment\\" said that the SAS building, which opened in January 1988, said that the building \\"refashioned entirely the traditional notion of office life by creating a giant complex with shops, restaurants, and coffee bars lining a solar-heated internal 'main street'\\" running through the facility's spine.Myserson, Jeremy. \\"After modernism: the contemporary office environment\\" (Chapter 10).

His work combines native music with contemporary techniques. Biography Born in Quito, Gerardo Guevara showed music ability at an early age. Because his father worked as a caretaker at the Conservatorio Nacional, Guevara used to eavesdrop on the music dictations that were being given to older children and sometimes ventured to shout the answer before running away. When he was fifteen he started studying composition with Luis H. Salgado. In 1952, while playing the piano in an orchestra in Guayaquil, he studied composition and the analysis of Bartok's music with the Hungarian musician Jorge Raycki. From 1959 onwards and thanks to a Unesco grant, Guevara studied composition with Nadia Boulanger at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris where he graduated as a conductor. While in Paris, he also studied musicology at the University of La Sorbonne. After twelve years in France, he went back to Ecuador where in 1972 he formed the choir of the Central University of Quito. A year later, he created the Sayce (Society for the protection of musicians).
