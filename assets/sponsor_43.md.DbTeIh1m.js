Page & Shaw started as a small shop at 9 West Street in Boston, then in 1911 opened a major factory on Ames Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with branch stores in England, France and Canada. In 1918 its factory and five stores were shut down by the Federal Food Board for one week because the company kept a larger quantity of sugar on hand than was permitted by the United States Food Administration. Around 1920, Boston lawyer Otis Emerson Dunham acquired control of the company. He began an aggressive plan of expansion. By 1924 sales reached a peak of 2,200,000 pounds of chocolate per year. At its height, the company operated thirty-five shops as well as candy factories in Cambridge, New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Montreal and London, and produced more than 6,000,000 pounds of chocolate candies annually in its Cambridge factory. After the stock market crash of 1929, business slumped badly, and under Dunham's direction, it started to give away one share of common stock with every $2 worth of candy. In 1930 Dunham and two stockbrokers were found guilty of conspiracy in raising $2,000,000 for Page & Shaw stock, of which they kept half for themselves. That same year, the company went bankrupt and was bought by Daggett Co. in 1931, which in turn was bought by Necco in 1960. Page & Shaw chocolates were discontinued at about that time. MIT's Wiesner Building now occupies Page & Shaw's former factory site on Ames Street. See also * List of confectionery brands  References  * History of Massachusetts Industries, by Orra L.

Paluch is the first woman to hold the chair of Professor of Anatomy in its 300 year history. Her work focuses on the cell cortex, a thin network of actin and myosin that lies under the cell membrane and determines the shape of most animal cells. The cortex enables the cell to resist externally applied forces and to exert mechanical work. As such, it plays a role in normal physiology during events involving cell deformation such as cell division and migration, and in diseases such as cancer where cell shape is often deregulated.

Education and career  Gardiner is a graduate of the University of Melbourne and was a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at University College London. In 1972 he set up and became the first president of the UCL GaySoc, which played a key role in the National Union of Students' gay rights campaign in the early 1970s. While in London, Gardiner also attended meetings of the newly formed Gay Liberation Front and the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. In 1973 Gardiner proposed and received support from the NUS to organise UCL's first Homosexuals in Education Conference. When Gardiner returned to Australia in 1974, he spearheaded the Homosexual Law Reform Coalition, a campaign to decriminalise consensual homosexual sex in the state of Victoria. In 1975 he took up a position as a mathematics lecturer at the Bendigo Institute of Technology and in the same year contributed to the first National Homosexual Conference in Melbourne. In 1977 Gardiner wrote a brief seeking expungement of homosexual convictions in Victoria, a goal finally achieved in 2014. Following Homosexual Law Reform Coalition's campaign against offending laws in the late 1970s, Victoria partially decriminalised homosexuality in December 1980. Subsequently, Gardiner became involved in anti-discrimination legal reform and AIDS politics. This included co-founding the Victorian AIDS Council in the early 1980s.

Early life  Lydia Baumbach was born in Stellenbosch, South Africa, in 1924, to a German missionary family associated with the Rhenish Mission.  Education  Baumbach attended the Stellenbosch Rhenish Girls' High School until 1942. She then studied at the University of Stellenbosch, achieving two M.A.s with distinction, one in Latin and one in Greek; for each of these she was awarded an Abe Bailey Scholarship. From 1955-1957 she attended the University of Cambridge as an Affiliated Student at Newnham College; during this period she studied the Linear B script under the supervision of John Chadwick, which she would continue to focus on in her research throughout her later career.  Career  In 1947 Baumbach began working at the University of Stellenbosch as a Junior Lecturer; after her studies in Cambridge, she took up a position as Lecturer at Rhodes University, where she was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1959. She moved briefly to the University of Pretoria and then became a Senior Lecturer in the University of Cape Town in 1965, where she was appointed as Chair of Classics in 1976; she remained in this position until her retirement in 1988. She taught both Latin and Greek languages and literature, and was a popular public speaker, delivering summer school lectures and tours of Greek sites for Swan Hellenic Tours; she was also active in the Classical Association of South Africa, which she chaired in 1983-1984, becoming the first woman to do so. Baumbach's research focused mainly on the Mycenaean Greek language and the Linear B writing system; her most important contributions to this field include compiling a vocabulary of Mycenaean Greek (with John Chadwick) in 1963 and publishing the supplement to this work as a sole author (in 1971), as well as being responsible for the compilation of two volumes of the Studies in Mycenaean Inscriptions and Dialect bibliography, published in 1968 and 1986. She also published studies focusing in detail on individual Linear B tablets or series of tablets, as well as a series of articles on the personal names in the Linear B texts, focusing on what the proportions of Greek or non-Greek names found amongst different groups of people showed about Mycenaean society.

She made a name for herself as a cattle baron and was infamous for her Texas Longhorn cattle that she took up the Chisholm Trail from Texas to Wichita, Kansas, with her three surviving children and her granddaughter. To date, she is the only known woman in the history of the United States to run her own cattle drive and was considered one of the first cattle queens after being widowed thrice.  Early life  Margaret Heffernan was born to Irish immigrant parents on April 3, 1824 in Ireland. Her parents were both born there as well, but they sailed to America and arrived in New York City when Margaret was five. Her father was a candlemaker who moved to Texas after he was having a hard time making ends meet. In 1829, when a land agent told Margaret's father about money opportunities in Texas, the Heffernans moved West to find fortune. The government was offering incentives as well to families that supplied their own tools and were able to sustain themselves for a year. If a family was able to do that the government would give a yoke of oxen, a cart, ten milking cows, and a league of land. In addition, the family was required to practice Catholicism and to speak Spanish for business purposes. Margaret was nine years old when she arrived in Texas. The family was part of the McMullen-McGloin colony that was aiming to place around 200 families into Texas. Once arriving in Texas, the family settled on land that was surrounded by the wild prairies near San Patricio in south Texas. There Margaret's father fared well with the Texas cattle industry, along with many Irish settlers, as the cattle industry was a common occupation for Irish settlers in the South at the time. Margaret's father died shortly after at the hands of Jos√© de Urrea's forces during the Texas Revolution prior to the Texas invasion by Santa Ana. Along with her father, and another cousin, her uncle, his wife, and their five children were murdered in the same attack. The surviving family fled to a fort at Goliad. The family returned home when news of recent successful campaigns against the Native Americans had reached their camp. Unfortunately, they were only able to be home for a short period before escalating tension with Mexico caused the government to advised residents to move from the area for protection purposes in October 1836. The family went to Brazoria, TX. The family was there at least two years before moving again. Margaret's mother would never remarry and she died in Victoria, TX in 1849.  Marriages and Family Life  In August 1843, Margaret married a man named Harrison Dunbar. In the 1840 census, Harrison Dunbar was listed as having 30 head of cattle, which would have set Margaret up for the beginning of her own career in cattle. Margaret gave birth to their daughter Mary in 1844, but Harrison died shortly after her birth from wounds he received in a pistol duel. Margaret was only 20 years old at the time. Shortly after, in October 1845, Margaret was remarried to a man named Milton Hardy. In the same 1840 census that showed the cattle count for Margaret's first husband, the census showed her second husband had 2,912 acres of land, as well as having five additional lots in town. They had two children together in the following two years. Two girls, Eliza who did not survive infancy, and Julia. The couple owned slaves and in Milton's 1847 will he made note that a slave he owned named Louisa and her children were to be freed upon his death. In 1852, Margaret gave birth to another healthy daughter named Rosa. That same year Milton contracted cholera during an epidemic that also killed their young son William, and he died on August 24. Milton had 1200 heads of cattle at the time of his death. Louisa was not freed according to Milton's will and she was forced to continue to care for Margaret's children, and future children, where she was known to them as 'Mammy'. Margaret was married for the third and time to a man named Alexander Borland on February 11, 1856. In 1858, Alexander participated in Victoria's first annual live stock exhibition. By the 1860 census, the couple had amassed the largest herd of cattle in Victoria, a number of 8,000. Additionally, they had twelve slaves, multiple properties, and personal wealth they had gained. They had four children together, 3 boys and a girl named Nellie. The Civil War gave the Borland's access to millions of cattle that were free roaming in Texas due to many ranchers leaving their farms to fight for the Confederate States Army. By 1867, the Borland's opened their own store but Alexander was not well. Since he had the money, Alexander spent it to see a surgeon in New Orleans, LA hoping to receive the best medical care. Alexander never returned to Victoria, and died in New Orleans, leaving Margaret a widow for the third time in her life. For Margaret, the tragedy did not stop there for her or her family. In the summer of the same year of Alexander's passing, yellow fever was spreading across Texas. The town of Victoria was not spared during this time and the first casualty for the family was Margaret's daughter Rosa, who was only 15 at the time of her passing. Margaret's firstborn Mary was next and, shortly after Mary passed, her infant son died as well. Margaret's daughter Julia, who was 19 and a new mom herself, also succumbed to the illness. Julia's husband, Victor Rose, who almost perished himself during the epidemic, left their daughter named Julia Rose with Margaret so she could raise her. With all of her children from her first two marriages now dead, Margaret began to bury her children from her most recent marriage. William was only 6 years old when he passed away in the same epidemic. By the time the epidemic ended with the cooler winter temperatures setting in, Margaret only had three surviving children out of the nine she birthed. Her son-in-law, Victor Rose, went on to become a writer, editor, and historian where he wrote about Margaret from an intimate perspective so we are able to gain some insight as to who she was from someone who knew her personally. Victor said this of Margaret in the local newspaper The Victoria Advocate, \\"a woman of resolute will, and self-reliance, yet was she not one of the kindest mothers. She had, unaided, acquired a good education, her manners were lady-like, and when fortune smiled upon her at last in a pecuniary sense, she was as perfectly at home in the drawing room of the cultured as if refinement had engulfed its polishing touches upon her mind in maidenhood.\\"  Cattlewoman  After the death of Alexander, Margaret took on full responsibility for purchasing and selling her cattle. She had previously worked with Alexander handling the cattle and therefore had a fair understanding of how to run her ranch. She did receive help from slaves, relatives, and farm hands when it came to the actual physical labor required to manage and maintain the herd. Her brother James Heffernan stayed with her and her family and was considered to be a loyal and hardworking man who helped his sister during difficult times. She did face hardships still, in the winter of 1871-72 a freak blizzard struck Victoria and killed thousands of her cattle who froze to death due to the storm. Despite the hardships of the previous years, by 1873 Margaret had over 10,000 cattle. Margaret decided to sell some of her cattle to provide some more income. The problem was that the prices for Texas cattle were about $8 per head, whereas the prices for cattle in Kansas were almost $24 per head. Margaret made the unprecedented decision to be her own trail boss and to drive her cattle over the Chisholm Trail to Kansas. To do this meant she needed to take her surviving children and her young granddaughter with her despite the dangerous road that lay ahead for them all. At the age of 49, Margaret made the decision to take her family and 2,500 cattle to Wichita, Kansas in search of opportunity and fortune. Her bravery and courage to be the first woman undertake this effort made the local newspapers and made her name well known in the South, as well as the rest of the United States.  Trail Boss on the Chisholm Trail to Kansas  The family set out for the Chisholm Trail, which started in South Texas, in 1873 with half a dozen hired hands in order to manage the herd of over 2,000 cattle. Margaret had to deal with trail hands that were superstitious and sometimes misogynistic, as they often saw women on the trail as a bad omen for them. It took the group about two months to make it from Texas to Kansas. During this time, they traveled at a leisurely pace to ensure the cattle were grazing enough and were not getting overly tired. Losing cattle to hunger and exhaustion was a real concern. They passed through Oklahoma before it was a state and was still considered Indian territory. Although it is possible that the group sold some of their animals to Indian agents to keep danger at bay or for supplies, when the group arrived in Kansas they still had a majority of their herd. In the year 1873, it is believed that around 400,000 Texas cattle total were brought into Kansas. Due to this influx, the cattle market crashed in the later part of the year and the cattle the Borland's brought from Texas did not earn them the financial gain they had expected. In fact, most cattle drivers who tried their luck in Kansas in 1873 suffered a financial loss. Sadly, Margaret would not make it to see the cattle sold, as she took ill towards the end of their journey and would not be able to make a full recovery.  Death  After successfully reaching Wichita, Kansas, via the Chisholm Trail, Margaret Borland was taken seriously sick by an illness known as trail fever. It has also been cited as congestion of the brain or meningitis. She ultimately did not recover, and passed away in a boardinghouse. She never had the chance to sell her cattle before her passing. The task was left to her surviving family members and those who she employed. The Wichita Beacon newspaper, now The Wichita Eagle, reported on Margaret's death with the following, \\"We regret to announce the painful news that Mrs. Borland, the widow lady who came up with her own herd of cattle about two months ago, bringing with her three little children, died at the Planter house Saturday evening with mania, superinduced by her long, tedious journey and over-taxation of the brain.\\" Margaret Borland died on July 5, 1873. She was 49 at the time of her death. Her body was then returned from Kansas to Texas where so could be buried in the state where she started her family and cattle business. Her sons Alex and Jesse bought her a gravestone which reads,  Publications    *  References  Category:1824 births Category:1873 deaths Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:American people of Irish descent Category:People from Victoria, Texas Category:People from Wichita, Kansas Category:Ranchers from Texas Category:American cattlewomen ","title":"Margaret Borland"},{"id":"61216150","text":"{{Infobox musical artist  name = Firas Abou Fakher  image = Mashrou¬¥Leila Rudolstadt 09.jpg  caption = Rudolstadt-Festival 2018  background = solo_singer  birth_name =  alias =  birth_date = <!-- Firas Abou Fakher () is a Lebanese composer and musician.

It is an important compositional element, which is especially distinct in the Dravidian architecture. Dravidian vimanas Vimanas above the sanctum are typically shaped as a four-sided pyramid, consisting of progressively smaller talas. Dravidian vimanas can be classified as one-story (called ekatala), two-story (dvi-tala), three-story (tri-tala), and so on. Usually, vimanas have up to seven stories. However, the tallest gopurams and vimanas, such as that of the Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam, may have up to 13 talas. Importantly, the kuta at the top of a vimana does not count as a separate tala. As a major horizontal division of a temple, in the middle each tala has a wall zone with slender pilasters. The side parts are usually heavily decorated with statues, which may add up to hundreds. Many temples claim that each one of such statues is unique. Vimanas are divided in two groups: jati vimanas that have up to four talas and mukhya vimanas that have five talas and more.

Participants discussed international cooperation and geopolitics. This conference reaffirmed the ten principles from the Bandung Conference and added four more exclusive principles, mostly about nuclear affairs. The conference created the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, which represents itself, as described in its later Constitution from the 1988 Delhi Conference, as a \\"mass solidarity movement of the peoples of Africa and Asia in the common struggle for the elimination of injustices to the people\\". This objective helps satisfy the \\"consolidation of genuine independence and the defense of sovereignty against racist policies to ensure economic security for the right to choose their way of socio-economic development, for the promotion of national culture, for a non-violent world and general disarmament, international security, and lasting peace\\".  Background  The Cairo Conference took place two years after the Bandung Conference which was held to promote Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism or neocolonialism committed by any nation. It took place at the beginning of the Cold War era. The 1957 Cairo Conference hosted many representatives of Soviet-allied states. The conference was organized by an Egyptian Committee under Anwar Sadat's leadership (later a President of Egypt) with most preparations overseen by the Conference Secretary, Egyptian writer Yusuf Al-Sibai. The Committee chose the themes to be discussed in the conference and was in charge of soliciting relevant participants.  Participants  The Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Conference in Cairo hosted 607 participants from the following countries: * African Delegation: 127 delegates from 19 countries. **Algeria : 12 delegates. ** Cameroon : 6 delegates. ** Ethiopia : 6 delegates. ** Egypt : 84 delegates. ** French Somaliland : 5 delegates. ** French West Africa : 5 delegates. ** Ghana : 5 delegates. ** Italian Somaliland : 11 delegates. ** Togoland : 2 delegates. ** Tunisia : 6 delegates. ** Uganda : 5 delegates. ** Zanzibar : 10 delegates. * Communist Delegation: 70 delegates from 5 countries. **Russia : 28 delegates. ** China ** North Korea ** Mongolia ** North Vietnam * Others: **Cyprus ** Sudan  Proceedings  The Conference was planned in three sections: * Plenary sessions made by leaders from the delegations. * The organisation of commissions in order to deal with the main themes of the Conference. * Final plenary sessions to draft the final resolutions. The commissions were divided into two groups: the Political Commission and the Economic Commission. = The Political Commission = The Political Commission was divided into five subcommittees: * The Palestinian Subcommittee * The Algerian Subcommittee * The Subcommittee on Imperialism * The Racial Discrimination Subcommittee * The Nuclear Warfare Subcommittee = The Economic Commission = The Economic Commission was divided into three sub- commissions: * Economic Struggle Against Colonialism * The Question of Colonial Territories * The Final Resolutions It is important to note that there was another small commission about culture.  Outcomes of the Conference  The first outcome of the Conference was the creation of the Solidarity Council of the Afro-Asian Countries. The Council's name was changed to Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization (AAPSO) at a subsequent conference in Conakry, Guinea in April 1960. This council is permanently based in Cairo, Egypt. The AAPSO accepted three main tasks: * Implement the resolutions and recommendations from the Conference. * Promote Afro-Asian solidarity movements in all countries across the two continents. * Act as a permanent liaison office between the solidarity movements across participating countries. Resolutions and recommendations from the Conference in 1957 were used to establish the Constitution of the Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organization in 1988. The objectives of the organization include: * To unite, consolidate and accelerate actions of solidarity with the struggle against all forms of aggression, racism, and to provide all-out moral, political and material support to the protection of freedom, and national independence. * To act in an interdependent world, in support of the principles of the United Nations Charter and Non-Aligned Movement. Leading to the cooperation between AAPSO with the UN and Non-Aligned Movement with the other governmental and non-governmental organizations that act for the same objectives. * To mobilize the peoples of Africa, Asia, and other developing countries, progressive and democratic forces all over the world, against the policy of destabilization, against military pacts, blocs, bases, and facilities. * To rally against exploitation, to overcome backwardness, for economic security, for the sovereign right of peoples over their national resources, and to bring about socio-economic transformations. * To strengthen the struggle for just and lasting peace and security, stopping the arms' race, for nuclear and complete disarmament, and for development. * To safeguard, respect and uphold human rights, equal rights for women, and special protection of the child, to support the struggle for democracy and for the promotion of the democratic solution to the conflicts of nationalities and minorities. ** To propagate the Charter of Universal Declaration of Human Rights including implementation of all the statutes, conventions, treaties and covenants passed and accepted by the United Nations Organization over the years. * To resolve international, regional, and national conflicts by peaceful dialogue, based on the principles of the UN Charter in the spirit of solidarity based on national reconciliation. * To support achievement and consolidation of the national unity within the Afro-Asian countries. * Deepen cooperation between socio- economic and cultural development for the New International Information and Communication Order. Leading to mutual assistance among nations and among democratic organizations for the realization of these goals. * To support the independent policy of the Afro-Asian States, organizations and forces which seek to extricate from political, economic, social, and cultural infiltration. * To work, while retaining its own identity, for the activation of the movement, focusing on the masses and mass organizations, and for establishing and consolidating the alliance of the progressive, national unity among Afro- Asians and other people of the world. * To work for the protection of the environment and for the safeguarding of the ecological resources of our planet.

It was envisaged by the Lebowa government during the 1980s as a 25,000 ha reserve called The Downs Nature Reserve, which would cater recreational activities, camping and hiking. Current amenities include self-catering accommodation, a bush camp with log cabins beside a stream, farmhouses serving as guest houses, and a camp for school outings. Since 2001 it is managed by the Limpopo Tourism and Parks Board. In the north it is contiguous with the Wolkberg Wilderness Area. The conservation area is traversed from west to east by the Orrie Baragwanath Pass, which is however only suitable for four-wheel drive vehicles. The western slopes are drained by tributaries of the Mohlapitse River which originates in the Wolkberg, and joins the Olifants River some kilometers to the south. Lekgalameetse means \\"the place of water\\" in the sePedi language of the Sekororo people, a tribe of the baPedi. The area has a varied butterfly fauna.

The wall was 17.5 m high with arrowslits and could withstand heavy enemy fire. Canons lay on the top floor. Ammunition and cannonballs were stored in the basement and in the gunpowder magazine behind the battery. The main guns were 12.5 m above sea level. Two hundred soldiers could be housed in the front barracks. However, military operations never needed to be launched from the fortress. When the artillery were first tested, however, two soldiers died and Gov. Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff was wounded.

She was particularly interested in girls' vocational training. Biography Amy Johanna Fredrika Segerstedt was born in √Öm√•l on 12 November 1835. Her father was Fredrik Segerstedt (d. 1856), a provincial doctor in √Öm√•l. She had three sisters, Amy, Lovisa, and Wilhelmina, as well as one brother, Vitalis. The family moved to Uppsala in 1860, where Segerstedt trained as a teacher at Klosterskolan (Thengbergska school) in 1861. She worked in 1861-1874 as a governess and in 1874‚Äì1879, as a teacher at Clara Lind's girls' school in G√§vle. Her final year of training, 1879‚Äì1880, was at a teacher seminar at Falu folk high school seminar, where she graduated in 1880. That same year, she became director of the newly- established elementary school for girls in √Öm√•l. After studying the \\"Hillic speech method\\" at schools for the deaf in Denmark and Norway, she became the director of Tysta school in Stockholm in 1882, remaining until 1894. At a conference in 1885 in Paris, she saw the private Braille library created by the nobleman, Maurice de La Sizeranne. In April 1892, she founded the F√∂reningen f√∂r blindskrift (Association for Braille), which published current literature in Braille. In December of that year, she opened a small lending library. It was housed in the Silent School in 1892‚Äì1895, then moved to the Blind Association, which in 1912 took it over and developed it into the Tal- och punktskriftsbiblioteket (Swedish Library of Talking Books and Braille, TPB), which is now called the Myndigheten f√∂r tillg√§ngliga medier (MTM) (Authority for Available Media). MTM distributes the Amy prize, which is named after her.

It is set in the same universe as his previous novella, The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps. It centers upon the forbidden relationship between an Olorumi royal and a Dalu√ßan peace envoy. Plot Summary The story is told out of chronological order. Aqib, a distant relative of the royal family of Olorum, is the assistant keeper of the royal Menagerie. He meets Lucrio, an ambassador from the Dalu√ßan kingdom. An attraction develops between then, despite an Olorumi prohibition against same-sex relationships. Ten days later, Lucrio boards a ship to return to his homeland with his new Olorumi wife. Aqib attempts to swim out to the ship, but is dragged back to shore by his brother, the Corporal. Aqib and Lucrio make love on the night after they meet; they continue to have nightly trysts for the duration of Lucrio‚Äôs stay. Three days after Lucrio leaves, the princess Femysade chooses Aqib as her husband; they marry and have a daughter, Lucretia. Aqib is summoned to a meeting with two Olorumi deities, who grant him the ability to communicate with animals. Femysade leaves her family to live with the gods. In the Royal Menagerie, Lucrio asks Aqib to leave Olorum with him. Torn between love for Lucrio and loyalty to his family and religion, Aqib declines. Later that night, he regrets this choice and attempts to leave, but is prevented by his father and the Corporal. Due to Femysade's jealousy, the gods erase all memories of Lucrio from Aqib's mind. At the age of 89, Aqib dies. It is revealed that Aqib actually chose to leave the Menagerie with Lucrio. For decades, he wondered if he had made the correct choice. Once per lifetime, a Sibylline Oracle allows supplicants to ask for one miracle. The Oracle offered Aqib the chance to live another life as if he had stayed in Olorum. In return for this vision, Aqib dips his hand into a jar of honey, and the Oracle consumes it. Aqib realizes that he made the correct choice. Despite the fact that Lucretia does not exist, he and Lucrio have made their own family in Daluz. Aqib realizes that he can now understand the language of animals, just as he did in his vision of another life. Awards and Reception A Taste of Honey has received positive reviews from fantasy authors such as N.K. Jemisin, as well as positive reviews in The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, and Booklist.

At least two people were killed and six people were shot. City officials called in Marines and Navy personnel to restore order. Background African-American troops in France, c. 1917‚Äì19 World War I ended with the signing of the Armistice of November 11, 1918. Though the fighting stopped, the war's potential to resume still existed and peace was only reached when representatives of Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The United States entered the war after it had been raging for years. When it did send men to the fronts of Europe, the U.S. armed forces remained segregated, with all-black and all-white units. Despite the segregation, many African Americans still volunteered to join the Allied war effort. By the time of the armistice with Germany, more than 350,000 African Americans had joined the military and risked their lives to serve with the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. In days prior to the riot, tensions were inflamed when civil unrest broke out in the nearby Washington Race Riot. Dozens were killed and even more injured in that riot. Incident In July 1919, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, planned a week-long celebration to honor the return of black troops to their city. During the celebration, it was alleged that a fight broke out between African Americans attending the event. White police moved in to make arrests, which sparked a riot that quickly spread to the black neighborhoods of the city. Alarmed, the city authorities called in police reserves and requested help from the navy. The naval base armed 100 sailors and 18 marines, and sent them into the fray to restore order. The clashes between whites and blacks that day resulted in two deaths and several injuries. Police officers C.H. Sheldon and B.C. Vick were shot in the foot and the leg, respectively. Aftermath The uprising in Norfolk was one of several incidents of civil unrest that are now known as the American Red Summer of 1919. Attacks on black communities and white oppression spread to more than three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine race riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 blacks and 5 whites were killed. Other major events of Red Summer were the Chicago race riot and Washington D.C. Race Riot, which caused 38 and 39 deaths, respectively. Both riots had many more non- fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.

History 1903 Map of Mill Bridge region in Rowan County, North Carolina by C. M. Miller While there have been farmers and large plantations in the area since the mid-1700s, the community of Mill Bridge was not officially registered until 1874. The Mill Bridge post office existed from July 23, 1874, to September 30, 1903, with Mary E. McCubbin as the first postmaster. In the 1880s, the Mill Bridge was a small prosperous agricultural community, centered around it historic Thyatira Presbyterian Church. After the Civil War, many freed slaves remained in the region, where there community was centered around the church, Oakland Presbyterian Church, which was established by the Northern Presbyterian Church.Carolina Watchman, April 9, 1885, While Mill Bridge has never been used as a U.S. Census or demographic location, it has been used as a postal location and the population has never been more than a few hundred people based on available maps. The nearby historic sites, including the Kerr Mill, Owen-Harrison House, and Thyatira Presbyterian Church have defined the community.1833, 1903 maps, and discussion in report by Cheeseman =Post offices= All of the postmasters of Mill Bridge were women: * Mary E.

This post office existed from September 12, 1827 to January 25, 1871 and from February 9, 1886 to September 30, 1903. The Miranda post office was located near Mill Bridge or may have been a predecessor before 1871 for Mill Bridge. According to the 1860 U.S. Census, there were 440 free persons enumerated in the Miranda post office, including 70 families in 70 houses. Most were farmers by occupation. Other occupations included school teachers, shoemakers, blacksmiths, buggy makers, carpenters, and two millers (George Hendrix and Green Eller). During the 1820s, Joseph Kerr was one of the largest and wealthiest plantation owners in Rowan County. His plantation included 1,500 acres between Sills and Cathey's Creeks and thirty to forty slaves. The community surrounding his plantation was registered as Kerrsville in 1827 when a post office was established at the Kerr plantation. Joseph died in 1829. The post office lasted only one year and was changed to Miranda, the plantation of John and James McConnaughy.

Early life  Andr√© Marie Hubert Grandcl√©ment was born in Rochefort on 28 July 1909, the son of Admiral Raoul Gaston Grandcl√©ment and Amelie de Barole. He was educated in Paris, Beirut, and Tunis. He joined the army in 1928, and married for the second time in 1929. After suffering a serious fall from a horse in 1934 he left the army and became an insurance broker in Bordeaux.  Wartime activities  In 1941 he founded a resistance network in the Bordeaux area. After joining the Civil and Military Organization in 1942, he became its head in Aquitaine and, with the help of the British Special Operations Executive, he strongly developed his regional network, arming and training several thousand agents, and setting up an escape route and a radio link with London. After Claude de Baissac, organiser of the Special Operations Executive SCIENTIST network was informed by France Antelme of the existence of the very strong resistance organisation in Bordeaux led by Grancl√©ment, which was eager to receive weapons and equipment, he made contact with Grancl√©ment and by mid-1943 the number of weapons drops was estimated at 150, equipping 42,000 potential fighters.Michel Augeard, Melpom√®ne se parfume √† l'h√©liotrope, JC Latt√®s, coll. ¬´ Essais et documents ¬ª, 2012, 422 p.

Landes had long considered Grancl√©ment to be a security risk but agreed to meet him, the Germans having let Grancl√©ment attend the meeting, during which he explained his intentions to expose dozens of arms dumps which would destroy many months work. Landes drew his pistol but hesitated to shoot Grandcl√©ment in cold blood and let him go. It proved to be a costly error of judgement as two months later Grandcl√©ment's actions had crippled SCIENTIST, and led to the capture and execution of the circuit's arms instructor, Victor Hayes. Landes was forced to flee, and was then recalled to London, leaving on 1 November 1943.The Telegraph, Obituary of Roger Landes In London he was suspected of being a double agent, but his name was cleared and he returned to Bordeaux in March 1944 as organiser of the ACTOR network, a new circuit tasked with making contact with surviving Resistance groups in the area and coordinating sabotage to support the D-Day landings.Nigel Perrin In July 1944 Grandcl√©ment and his wife, Lucette, were captured by Resistance forces near Bordeaux. Having let Grandcl√©ment walk away in September 1943, Landes gave the order for his execution. Grandcl√©ment and his wife were told that they were to be flown to England to argue their case, and were taken to the supposed landing site. Once there, Landes told Grandcl√©ment that he would have to be separated from his wife for security reasons, and then shot Grandcl√©ment's wife, while Grandcl√©ment was executed by one of Landes's men. Although Landes learned after the war that Lucette Grandcl√©ment was opposed to her husband's actions, he later explained that he had concluded that he could not let her go, given the risk she presented to his group.

Biography The daughter of a farmer, Benita Gil Lamiel spent her childhood in La Ginebrosa, although the nucleus of her family came from and resided in Mas de las Matas, where she went to school from ages 11 to 14. In 1928 the family moved to Zaragoza. There she pursued a teaching career from 1928 to 1932, becoming the first woman in her family to earn a university degree. She was one of a large number of women teachers to be hired under the Second Republic's Professional Teaching Plan. A member of the Provincial Association of Primary Education Teachers in Zaragoza, during the Civil War Gil worked as a teacher in Alca√±iz, and beginning in April 1938, in Llan√ß√†, a circumstance that facilitated her departure from Spain. In January 1939 she went into exile in France, where she married Felipe Serrano, a fellow teacher who had been her partner since 1938, and with whom she would have two children. In 1950, her husband was expelled from France along with many other Spaniards. They were taken in by Czechoslovakia and were assigned to √öst√≠ nad Labem, a city in northern Bohemia. The following year, in December 1951, Gil and her children, together with relatives of other Spaniards, were gathered in Toulouse where a night train took them to Prague. Gil worked as a textile company operator for eight years, and in the early 1960s, as a member of the Communist Party of Spain, she went to work for the World Federation of Trade Unions, an organization in which she would serve as a French interpreter and secretary of the Latin American Section for 17 years. In 1980, Gil and her husband returned to democratic Spain. However, in 1992, they moved back to Prague to be close to their children and grandchildren. Gil was made a Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 2014. Receiving the honor in Prague, she recalled the circumstances of her long exile.

The system has so far seen most use on the European high end market.  History  Before the Zeiss rail, many European scope manufacturers used to offer a single type of standardized ringless mounting solution known as standard prism. This mounting solution was also known under names such as exterior rail, 70¬∞ prism rail or LM rail (Light Metal).Mount rail Compared to ring mounts, this type of mounting rail permitted mounting without putting compression on the internal mechanics of the scope. The system also allowed the shooter to place the scope at their preferred height and correct eye relief (distance to the eye), as well as the opportunity to easily move the scope between different firearms. However, the standard prism had an aesthetic drawback in that the scope rail had to drilled on the side for attachment screws. In case the rifle scope was to be used on different guns, new holes often had to be drilled. A motivation for developing the Zeiss rail was thus to avoid such drilling. The Zeiss rail system was introduced in 1990 as an option on all Zeiss ZM/Z riflescopes, the top of the line riflescope offered by Zeiss at that time. The system was later offered on the new top of line VM/V models. For these reasons, some sources have referred to the Zeiss rail system under names such as Zeiss ZM/VM rail or Zeiss M rail. Names such as Zeiss Integral rail, Zeiss 45¬∞ rail or simply Z rail have also been used.  Technical  Compared to the older prism rail, the Zeiss rail does not require any drilling, and therefore provides easier mounting to the user, as well as improved aesthetics. Compatible scopes have an internal dovetail rail where two or more 45 degree wedge nuts can be slid in. For example, EAW uses wedge nuts with M5 or M4 threads.EAW Spare Parts and Tools catalogue 2017, Keilmutter/clamping block page 3 and 5 The scope mount is then attached using simple hand tools like a torx key or hex key to a torque between .Zeiss ZM / VM rail Mounts - Optics-trade File:Zeiss rail scope mounting system.pngDrawing of scopes with Zeiss rail (left) and ring mount (right), both with picatinny receiver interface. File:Wedge nut.pngWedge nut with metric M5 threads. = Advantages = ;Robust mounting :Compared to ring mounts, the rail mount can hold on to the scope in stronger recoil forces without slipping.Zeiss ZM/VM rail mounting of Rifle Scopes (YouTube) ;Added stiffness :The extra material on the underside of the scope body increases stiffness and robustness. While this also increases the weight of the scope itself, it also allows for a lighter mount. ;Horizontal reticle :The aiming reticle is ensured to be mounted horizontally each time. ;Less chance of mounting errors :On ring mounts, overtightening of the rings is not an uncommon mounting error.Two Common Scope-Mounting Mistakes ‚Äì Shooting Times This can squeeze the otherwise round tube and put stress on the inner workings of the scope, resulting in either temporary or permanent damage to its mechanical and/or optical properties. In comparison, inner rail mounts are designed to be tension-free and not put stress on the main tube. After placing the wedge nuts inside the rail, the scope mount is then attached from the outside with a force from a 22.5 degree angle on each side, resulting in a self centering design. ;More flexible placement :Inner rail mounts can allow for more variations in placement on the firearm. With ring mounts, the scope adjustment knobs can put restraints on the placement of the scope. In comparison, the inner rail mount gives the user more freedom to slide the scope forwards or backwards. The stepless dovetail shaped mounting surface gives more flexibility in adjustment of distance to the shooter's eye in order to get the proper eye relief. ;No ring marks :When using ring mounts, marks on the scope tube can occur.larrywillis.com ‚Äì Mounting a Scope This can happen even when ring mounts are mounted with proper torque if for example either the ring mount or the scope tube itself are slightly over or undersized.buckmasters.com ‚Äì Advanced Scope Mounting Since inner rail mounts do not have rings, ring marks are avoided. ;A different look :A ringless mount gives the firearm a different look which is preferred by some as being less protrusive. ;Same mount for different main tube sizes : Scopes with rail mounts do not grip around the main tube. The same rail mount can therefore be used for different scopes regardless of their main tube size. Therefore the user does not have to worry about the main tube size and compatibility with existing mounts when purchasing a new scope. = Disadvantages = ;Price and availability :Inner rail scope mounts are currently offered by far fewer manufacturers compared to ring mounts. For some time they have only been offered by high end European manufacturers. ;Compatibility :Scopes made for other systems, such as ring mounts or other inner rail mounts, are not compatible with the Zeiss rail. Before purchase the user has to decide which system to use. These inner rails are an integral part of the scope body and can not be removed.  Scope offerings  The Zeiss rail system can be found on some models from scope manufacturers such as Docter, Leica, Minox, Meopta and Schmidt & Bender, and sometimes only on high end models. Often the manufacturer will offer these models in two variations; one for traditional ring mounts, and another for the Zeiss rail mount. There are also examples of rifle scopes that thave been sold exclusively for Zeiss rail mounts (i.e. no option for a ring mount version). These include the Zeiss Victory Diarange laser rangefinder scopeVictory Diarange riflescopes from ZEISS ‚Äì with integrated laser rangefinder  ZEISS United States and the Zeiss Varipoint iC models.Victory Varipoint iC riflescopes from ZEISS ‚Äì with illumination control iC  ZEISS International In late 2017,Blaser Infinity: three new riflescopes for hunters - all4shooters Blaser released their Infinity iC (illumination Control) line of scopes which also only uses the Zeiss rail system.

Compatible mounts are offered in different configurations, depending on the mounting opportunities on the firearm receiver. Examples include Picatinny, Weaver or different types of claw or swing (pivot) mounts.  Scope height calculations  The height placement of the scope on a rifle should be matched to the stock dimensions and personal preference. In general, a higher scope mount can give better recoil control, while a lower mount can give the firearm better balance. Especially the cheek rest and scope height together play an important role for comfortable shooting. Some cheek rests or scope mounts have adjustable height. The following section mentions relevant terminology. = Mount construction height = The construction height of a scope mount is an important factor contributing to how high the scope will sit on a rifle. \\"Construction height\\" typically refers to only the height contribution from the mount itself, and is typically provided by the mount manufacturer. Low Zeiss rail mounts typically have a construction height between for traditional bolt action hunting rifles, but can be up to for modern bolt and AR-style rifles. = Scope body height = A Zeiss rail system typically adds height to the scope body, but also gives the possibility for a slimmer scope mount so that the total scope height can become comparable to a traditional ring mount. The added scope body height due to the rail piece on the scope itself contributes about to the total height. This can be treated like a constant term which can be added to adapt traditional scope height eqautions for the Zeiss rail system. Like with traditional ring mounts, the diameter of the scope tube itself also affects the distance from the bore to the crosshair. Mainly, a larger main tube will increase the total height by half the main tube difference (a 36 mm tube will thus typically sit 3 mm higher than a 30 mm tube, all else being equal). The height contribution from the scope body, that is from the bottom of the scope body to the center of the reticle, is typically provided by the scope manufacturer, along with the ~5.5 mm constant term due to the rail piece on the scope. = Other considerations = The distance from the center of bore to the top of the receiver interface is of interest for ballistics calculations, like when constructing a ballistic table.  Competing standards  Competing standards to the Zeiss rail include the Swarovski SR rail and Schmidt & Bender Convex rail. The three systems are not compatible. While the Zeiss rail has a stepless dovetail shaped mounting surface, the Swarovski SR rail has a finely toothed rail, and the S&B; Convex has a smooth convex rail.

It is Vieira's most famous work. It was preached in the context of the conflict between the colony's settlers and the Jesuits, who reiterated Pope Urban VIII's prohibition against Indian slavery. Three days after preaching it, Vieira secretly embarked to Lisbon to appeal King John IV for laws that would guarantee basic rights to Brazilian Indians, preventing them from being exploited by white colonists. The sermon comprises an elaborate allegory: borrowing from the familiar legend of his namesake Saint Anthony's preaching to the fish (commonly cited in his hagiography), Vieira uses the different kinds of fish as metaphors for men, drawing direct parallels between the dynamics between big and little fish and those between colonists and the Indians. Historical context The Jesuit Father Vieira arrived in Maranh√£o, Colonial Brazil, in early 1653, at a time prudence recommended his departure from the royal court in Lisbon, where his success, freedom of speech and reforming zeal had earned him several powerful enemies. Vieira made great efforts to convert the African slaves and indigenous peoples of Brazil, but soon found every difficulty was placed in his way by the colonial authorities: they not only set the wrong example with the scandalous sins of war, adultery, concubinage, blasphemy, but, more importantly, they profited hugely from their exploitation of the enslaved natives. The Jesuits in the colony wished to evangelize the natives, for which it was imperative to spare them a destructive servitude. Conflicts between the settlers and the Jesuits in Brazil went as far as 1549, and were to last until the latter were banished in 1760. Saint Anthony Preaching to the Fishes, c. 1630, attributed to Francisco de Herrera the Elder (Detroit Institute of Arts) Vieira used his renowned oratory skills to preach against the enslavement of the Indians. On 13 June 1654 he preached the Sermon of Saint Anthony to the Fish in the Church of Saint Anthony in S√£o Lu√≠s do Maranh√£o. It is not merely incidental that Vieira chose Saint Anthony of Lisbon as his subject: not only it was the saint's feast day, but the Portuguese saint traveled widely and was noted for his great learning and oratory, not unlike Vieira. Saint Anthony's hagiography includes the legendary episode of the Sermon of the Fishes: while preaching to the heretics at Rimini who derided him, the saint turned instead to the seashore and began to preach to the fishes on their predatory nature; the fishes miraculously came at his call, and remained with their heads out of the water until he had finished speaking and gave them his blessing. Instead of, as expected, commenting on the saint's apostolic virtue having the day's Gospel as a starting point, Vieira instead satirised his disenchantment with the colonists and their vices by making allusions to their faults in the characteristics of different types of fish, in a direct imitation of Saint Anthony: \\"But for many days now it has been in my thoughts that, on the feast days of the Saints, it is better to preach like them than to preach about them. All the more so since the salt of my doctrine, whatever it is, has had in this city a fortune so similar to that of Saint Anthony in Rimini that it is necessary to follow him in everything.\\" Vieira saw, however, that the state of affairs was unsustainable and that the natives must be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the governors, to prevent their exploitation, and placed under the control of the members of the religious society. Accordingly, three days later, Vieira secretly set sail for Lisbon to plead the cause of the Indians, and in April 1655 he obtained from King John IV a series of decrees which placed the missions under the Society of Jesus, with Vieira himself as their superior, and prohibited the enslavement of the natives, except in certain specific cases. Summary The structure of the Sermon follows the Ciceronian tradition: an introduction presenting the theme (exordium) ending in an invocation to the Virgin Mary as the Domina maris; the main body of the sermon, allegorical in nature, wherein are Vieira's arguments and counterarguments (narratio and confirmatio); and the conclusion (peroratio). The theme of the Sermon comes from the Gospel of Matthew: \\"Vos estis sal terr√¶\\" (). After the theme exposition, Vieira's discourse has its development divided into two parts: praise for the fishes' virtues and reprehension for their vices. =The good fish= Tobias and the Fish, c. 1640, by Andrea Vaccaro (National Art Museum of Catalonia) Praising the fish, Vieira compliments their ability to listen and not speak; their inability to convert matters not to the preacher since \\"this is such an ordinary pain that custom makes it almost imperceptible\\". The fact that they cannot be domesticated means they have not been corrupted by men. Vieira goes on to list the virtues of particular fish: *The Holy Fish of Tobias ‚Äî represents preachers and their inner virtue; from the Biblical account in the Book of Tobit, the fish came to Tobias as an apparent threat but the Archangel Raphael instructed him to use the fish's gall to cure his father's blindness and his heart to cast away the demon Asmodeus *The remora ‚Äî a small fish that latches on to ships, holding them back; it is compared to the strength of the good preacher's words, arresting human passions and changing the course of sinners' lives *The torpedo ‚Äî an electric ray that is capable of emitting a shock into the body of a prey animal to stun it; it represents conversion *The four-eyes ‚Äî a fish with eyes above the top of the head and divided in two different parts, so that they can see below and above the surface; it represents the virtue of prudence, having sights set onto Heaven above but always mindful of Hell below =The bad fish= Peter Isselburg (Emblemata Politica In Aula Magna Curiae Noribergensis Depicta) The greatest thing Vieira finds reprehensible about fish is that they eat one another (\\"So foreign a thing it is, not only to reason but to nature itself, that you live by eating one another, all you being created in the same element, all of you citizens of the same homeland, and all of you, finally, brothers\\"), noting on how big fish eating small fish is particularly perverse because the big ones cannot satisfy their hunger by eating the little ones one by one. He also remarks on how easily fish are tempted by just any old piece of cloth passing for bait dangling on a hook (Vieira here makes reference to the habits of the Portuguese orders of chivalry, overtly attacking the social elites). He then chastises specific fish on their particular vices: *The grunt ‚Äî a small fish that produces sound by grinding its teeth; it symbolises pride and arrogance (and is compared to other Biblical grunts like Saint Peter at the Last Supper, Goliath before the young David, Caiaphas and Pilate during the Passion) *The suckerfish ‚Äî fish that use their suckers to cling to larger marine animals like sharks; they invariably meet their demise when the big fish fall, representing freeloaders and opportunists *The flying fish ‚Äî which have modified wing-like fins that enable them to glide abode the surface when leaping out of water; they evade the fisherman's hook only to accidentally land aboard his boat, representing vanity and the sin of ambition (\\"you are not birds, but fish, and not even among the best fish\\") *The octopus ‚Äî resembles a monk with its mantle and seems gentle due to its flexible appendages, but shoots ink as a smoke screen before he attacks his prey; represents treachery and is called worse than Judas Iscariot (\\"Judas embraced Christ, but others arrested Him; the Octopus is the one who embraces and moreover arrests\\") References Category:1654 works Category:17th-century Christian texts Category:Christian sermons Category:Works about slavery ","title":"Sermon of Saint Anthony to the Fish"},{"id":"61217721","text":"Nagtoralik-45 (also known as N-45) is a Greenlandic sports club based in Paamiut, Sermersooq, Greenland.

Life and scientific career He graduated from the Faculty of Biology and Earth Sciences at the University of Warsaw in 1962. He obtained his doctoral degree in 1969 and became a Professor of Natural Sciences in 1988. Between 1987 and 1990 he worked as Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Biology at the University of Warsaw. Since the mid-1980 until 2009, he also worked as head of the Department of Hydrobiology at his alma mater. He has been collaborating with a number of international institutions including the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl√∂n. He is an author and co-author of several hundred scientific papers and publications primarily in the field of hydrobiology with a special focus on behavioral ecology. Some of his interests concern predator-prey relations and trophic cascades among aquatic organisms. He discovered the relationship between the size of filtrator and minimum quantity of threshold food, thus explaining some of the mechanisms of ecological competition and supporting the size-efficiency hypothesis. He also described the phenomenon of the so-called \\"lunar trap\\" and explained the convergence of periodic population declines of zooplankton in African water reservoirs along the Zambezi and the lunar cycles. Gliwicz was one of the members of limnologists who were part of the Plankton Ecology Group, which devised the model of seasonal succession of planktonic events, accepted as the PEG standard model since mid-1980s. He also conducted research into the predation and the evolution of vertical migration in zooplankton. In 2001, he won Poland's top scientific award, Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science in the category of life sciences, for \\"revealing the role of predation in shaping animal demography, life histories and behaviour.\\" In 2012, he became the recipient (together with Winfried Lampert) of the A.C. Redfield Lifetime Achievement Award conferred by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography \\"for their outstanding individual and collaborative research, which has laid the foundations for our current understanding of phytoplankton- zooplankton interactions, trophic ecology of zooplankton, and evolutionary relationships in freshwater ecosystems.\\" As a popularizer of Neo-Darwinism, he coorganizes evolutionary biology workshops and he has been appointed a supervisor of the University of Warsaw's honorary doctorate for American evolutionary geneticist Francisco J. Ayala. His scientific contributions in hydrobiology have been recognized by scientists who discovered a new genus of diatoms and named it Gliwiczia in his honour.

Offscreen action often leaves much to the audience's imagination. As a narrative mode and stylistic device, it may be used for a number of dramatic effects. It may also be used to save time in storytelling, to circumvent technical or financial constraints of a production, or to meet content rating standards. Uses In ancient Greek drama, events were often recounted to the audience by a narrator, rather than being depicted on the stage. Offscreen voice-over narration continues to be a common tool for conveying information authoritatively. Charlie Chaplin made use of offscreen action to humorous effect. In The Kid (1921), his character of The Tramp is asked the name of his baby. He quickly ducks into a nearby building, emerges seconds later smoothing the child's blankets, and announces, \\"John\\". The implication is that he had not even determined the child's sex, much less given it a name until that moment. In City Lights (1931), Chaplin's Tramp is preparing for a boxing match. He asks another boxer a question which the audience is not privy to, then follows the man's direction off screen, presumably looking for a bathroom. However, he returns moments later, and asks the man to help him remove his boxing gloves. Later, it's shown that he was merely looking for a water fountain. In a deleted scene in Shoulder Arms (1918), Chaplin's character is berated by an abusive wife who is never seen on camera; her presence is merely implied by household objects hurled in Chaplin's direction. In the horror genre, placing action offstage or offscreen often serves to heighten the dramatic force of a scene. The Grand Guignol theatre in Paris made much use of this technique; in 1901's Au tƒólƒóphone, the violence is presented at the remove of a telephone connection. In 1931's Dracula, director Tod Browning uses offscreen action to avoid showing scenes of murder, and obscures the action of Dracula rising from his grave. While this served to meet Motion Picture Production Code standards, which dictated that \\"brutal killings are not to be shown in detail\\", Browning's offscreen action also maintains the macabre mood of the film. The choice of what the audience is shown in place of the elided action can also contribute to the sense of horror through its symbolic value. In Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), during the murder of Ivy Pierson, director Rouben Mamoulian focuses his camera on a statuette of Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss, which acts as an ironic commentary on the action. Offscreen action may also be used when a scene would otherwise require costly costumes or makeup, sets, locations, or special effects to present convincingly.

It extends down at least 5 kilometers below the continental surface and 10.5 kilometers below the sea surface, at temperatures that may reach beyond 100¬∞C. It includes all three domains of life and the genetic diversity rivals that on the surface. The first indications of deep life came from studies of oil fields in the 1920s, but it was not certain that the organisms were indigenous until methods were developed in the 1980s to prevent contamination from the surface. Samples are now collected in deep mines and scientific drilling programs in the ocean and on land. Deep observatories have been established for more extended studies. Near the surface, living organisms consume organic matter and breathe oxygen. Lower down, these are not available, so they make use of \\"edibles\\" (electron donors) such as hydrogen (released from rocks by various chemical processes), methane (CH4), reduced sulfur compounds and ammonium (NH4). They \\"breathe\\" electron acceptors such as nitrates and nitrites, manganese and iron oxides, oxidized sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide (CO2). There is very little energy at greater depths, so metabolisms are up to a million times slower than at the surface. Cells may live for thousands of years before dividing and there is no known limit to their age. The subsurface accounts for about 90% of the biomass in two domains of life, Archaea and Bacteria, and 15% of the total for the biosphere. Eukarya are also found, including some multicellular life (nematodes, fungi, flatworms, rotifers, annelids and arthropods). Viruses are also present and infect the microbes.  Definition  The deep biosphere is an ecosystem of organisms and their living space in the deep subsurface. For the seafloor, an operational definition of deep subsurface is the region that is not bioturbated by animals; this is generally about a meter or more below the surface. On continents, it is below a few meters, not including soils. The organisms in this zone are sometimes referred to as intraterrestrials.  History  At the University of Chicago in the 1920s, geologist Edson Bastin enlisted the help of microbiologist Frank Greer in an effort to explain why water extracted from oil fields contained hydrogen sulfide and bicarbonates. These chemicals are normally created by bacteria, but the water came from a depth where the heat and pressure were considered too great to support life. They were able to culture anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria from the water, demonstrating that the chemicals had a bacterial origin. Also in the 1920s, Charles Lipman, a microbiologist at the University of California, Berkeley, noticed that bacteria that had been sealed in bottles for 40 years could be reanimated ‚Äì a phenomenon now known as anhydrobiosis. He wondered whether the same was true of bacteria in coal seams. He sterilized samples of coal, wetted them, crushed them and then succeeded in culturing bacteria from the coal dust. One sterilization procedure, baking the coal at 160 degrees Celsius for up to 50 hours, actually encouraged their growth. He published the results in 1931. The first studies of subsurface life were conducted by Claude E. Zobell, the \\"father of marine microbiology\\", in the late 1930s to the 1950s. Although the coring depth was limited, microbes were found wherever the sediments were sampled. With increasing depth, aerobes gave way to anaerobes. Alvin taken in 1969 Most biologists dismissed the subsurface microbes as contamination, especially after the submersible Alvin sank in 1968 and the scientists escaped, leaving their lunches behind. When Alvin was recovered, the lunches showed no sign of microbial decay. This reinforced a view of the deep sea (and by extension the subsurface) as a lifeless desert. The study of the deep biosphere was dormant for decades, except for some Soviet microbiologists who began to refer to themselves as geomicrobiologists. Interest in subsurface life was renewed when the United States Department of Energy was looking for a safe way of burying nuclear waste, and Frank J. Wobber realized that microbes below the surface could either help by degrading the buried waste or hinder by breaching the sealed containers. He formed the Subsurface Science Program to study deep life. To address the problem of contamination, special equipment was designed to minimize contact between a core sample and the drilling fluid that lubricates the drill bit. In addition, tracers were added to the fluid to indicate whether it penetrated the core. In 1987, several boreholes were drilled near the Savannah River Site, and microorganisms were found to be plentiful and diverse at least 500 metres below the surface. From 1983 to 2003, microbiologists analyzed cell abundances in drill cores from the Ocean Drilling Program. A group led by John Parkes of the University of Bristol reported concentrations of 104 to 108 cells per gram of sediment down to depths of 500 metres (agricultural soils contain about 109 cells per gram). This was initially met with skepticism and it took them four years to publish their results. In 1998, William Whitman and colleagues published a summary of twelve years of data in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They estimated that up to 95% of all prokaryotes (archaea and bacteria) live in the deep subsurface, with 55% in the marine subsurface and 39% in the terrestrial subsurface. In 2002, ODP Leg 201 was the first to be motivated by a search for deep life. Most of the previous exploration was on continental margins, so the goal was to drill in the open ocean for comparison.  Scientific methods  The present understanding of subsurface biology was made possible by numerous advances in technology for sample collection, field analysis, molecular science, cultivation, imaging and computation. = Sample collection = D/V Chiky≈´. Researcher sampling fluid from a deep mine. The ocean floor is sampled by drilling boreholes and collecting cores. The methods must be adapted to different types of rock, and the cost of drilling limits the number of holes that can be drilled. Microbiologists have made use of scientific drilling programs: the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), which used the JOIDES Resolution drilling platform, and the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), which used the Japanese ship Chiky≈´. Deep underground mines, for example South African gold mines and the Pyh√§salmi copper and zinc mine in Finland, have provided opportunities to sample the deep biosphere. The deep subsurface has also been sampled at chosen or proposed nuclear waste repository sites (e.g. Yucca Mountain and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in the United States, √Ñsp√∂ and surrounding areas in Sweden, Onkalo and surrounding areas in Finland, Mont Terri in Switzerland). Scientific drilling of continental deep subsurface has been promoted by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). To allow continuous underground sampling, various kinds of observatories have been developed. On the ocean floor, the Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit (CORK) seals a borehole to cut off the influx of seawater. An advanced version of CORK is able to seal off multiple sections of a drill hole using packers, rubber tubes that inflate to seal the space between the drill string and the wall of the borehole. In sediments, the Simple Cabled Instrument for Measuring Parameters In-Situ (SCIMPI) is designed to remain and take measurements after a borehole has collapsed. Packers are also used in the continental subsurface, along with devices such as the flow-through in situ reactor (FTISR). Various methods are used to extract fluids from these sites, including passive gas samplers, U-tube systems and osmotic gas samplers. In narrow (less than 50 millimeter) holes, polyamide tubes with a back-pressure valve can be lowered to sample an entire column of fluid. = Field analysis and manipulation = Some methods analyze microbes in situ rather than extract them. In biogeophysics, the effects of microbes on properties of geological materials are remotely probed using electrical signals. Microbes can be tagged using a stable isotope such as carbon-13 and then re-injected in the ground to see where they go. A \\"push- pull\\" method involves injection of a fluid into an aquifer and extraction of a mixture of injected fluid with the ground water; the latter can then be analyzed to determine what chemical reactions occurred. = Molecular methods and cultivation = Methods from modern molecular biology allow the extraction of nucleic acids, lipids and proteins from cells, DNA sequencing, and the physical and chemical analysis of molecules using mass spectrometry and flow cytometry. A lot can be learned about the microbial communities using these methods even when the individuals cannot be cultivated. For example, at the Richmond Mine in California, scientists used shotgun sequencing to identify four new species of bacteria, three new species of archaea (known as the Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nanoorganisms), and 572 proteins unique to the bacteria. = Geochemical methods = Deep microorganisms change the chemistry of their surroundings. They consume nutrients and product wastes from metabolism. Therefore we can estimate the activities of the deep microorganisms by measuring the chemical compositions in the subseafloor samples. Complementary techniques include measuring the isotope compositions of the chemicals or the related minerals.  Conditions for life  For life to have metabolic activity, it must be able to take advantage of a thermodynamic disequilibrium in the environment. This can occur when rocks from the mantle that are rich in the mineral olivine are exposed to seawater and react with it to form serpentine minerals and magnetite. Non-equilibrium conditions are also associated with hydrothermal vents, volcanism, and geothermal activity. Other processes that might provide habitats for life include roll front development in ore bodies, subduction, methane clathrate formation and decomposition, permafrost thawing, infrared radiation and seismic activity. Humans also create new habitats for life, particularly through remediation of contaminants in the subsurface. = Energy sources = Life requires enough energy to construct adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Where there is sunlight, the main processes for capturing energy are photosynthesis (which harnesses the energy in sunlight by converting carbon dioxide into organic molecules) and respiration (which consumes those molecules and releases carbon dioxide). Below the surface, the main source of energy is from chemical redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions. This requires electron donors (compounds that can be oxidized) and electron acceptors (compounds that can be reduced). An example of such a reaction is methane oxidation: :CH4 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí CO2 \\\\+ 2 H2O Here CH4 is the donor and O2 is the acceptor. Donors can be considered \\"edibles\\" and acceptors \\"breathables\\". The amount of energy that is released in a metabolic reaction depends on the redox potential of the chemicals involved. Electron donors have negative potentials. From highest to lowest redox potential, some common donors available in the subsurface are organic matter, hydrogen, methane, reduced sulfur compounds, reduced iron compounds and ammonium. From most negative to least, some acceptors are oxygen, nitrates and nitrites, manganese and iron oxides, oxidized sulfur compounds, and carbon dioxide. Of electron donors, organic matter has the most negative redox potential. It can consist of deposits from regions where sunlight is available or produced by local organisms. Fresh material is more easily utilized than aged. Terrestrial organic matter (mainly from plants) is typically harder to process than marine (phytoplankton). Some organisms break down organic compounds using fermentation and hydrolysis, making it possible for others to convert it back to carbon dioxide. Hydrogen is a good energy source, but competition tends to make it scarce. It is particularly rich in hydrothermal fluids where it is produced by serpentinization. Multiple species can combine fermentation with methanogenesis and iron oxidation with hydrogen consumption. Methane is mostly found in marine sediments, in gaseous form (dissolved or free) or in methane hydrates. About 20% comes from abiotic sources (breakdown of organic matter or serpentinization) and 80% from biotic sources (which reduce organic compounds such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and acetate). Over 90% of methane is oxidized by microbes before it reaches the surface; this activity is \\"one of the most important controls on greenhouse gas emissions and climate on Earth.\\" Reduced sulfur compounds such as elemental sulfur, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and pyrite (FeS2) are found in hydrothermal vents in basaltic crust, where they precipitate out when metal- rich fluids contact seawater. Reduced iron compounds in sediments are mainly deposited or produced by anaerobic reduction of iron oxides. The electron acceptor with the highest redox potential is oxygen. Produced by photosynthesis, it is transported to the ocean floor. There, it is quickly taken up if there is a lot of organic material, and may only be present in the top few centimeters. In organic-poor sediments it can be found at greater depths, even to the oceanic crust. Nitrate can be produced by degradation of organic matter or nitrogen fixation. Oxygen and nitrate are derived from photosynthesis, so underground communities that utilize them are not truly independent of the surface. = Nutrients = All life requires carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and some trace elements such as nickel, molybdenum and vanadium. Over 99.9% of Earth's carbon is stored in the crust and its overlying sediments, but the availability of this carbon can depend on the oxidation state of the environment. Organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus are primarily found in terrestrial sediments, which accumulate mainly in continental margins. Organic carbon is mainly produced at the surface of the oceans with photosynthesis or washed into oceans with terrestrial sediments. Only a small fraction is produced in the deep seas with chemosynthesis. When organic carbon sinks from the surface of the ocean to the seafloor, most of the organic carbon is consumed by organisms in seawater. Only a small fraction of this sinking organic carbon can reach the seafloor and be available to the deep biosphere. Deeper in the marine sediments, the organic content drops further. Phosphorus is taken up by iron oxyhydroxides when basalts and sulfide rocks are weathered, limiting its availability. The availability of nutrients are limiting the deep biosphere, determining where and what type of deep organisms can thrive. = Pressure = The PUSH50 device keeps deep-sea samples at high pressure. Atmospheric pressure is 101 kilopascals (kPa). In the ocean, the pressure increases at a rate of 10.5 kPa per meter of depth, so at a typical depth of the sea floor (3800 meters) the pressure is 38 megapascals (MPa). At these depths, the boiling point of water is over 400¬∞C. At the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the pressure is 110 MPa. In the lithosphere, the pressure increases by 22.6 kPa per meter. The deep biosphere withstands pressures much higher than the pressure at the surface of the Earth. An increased pressure compresses lipids, making membranes less fluid. In most chemical reactions, the products occupy more volume than the reactants, so the reactions are inhibited by pressure. Nevertheless, some studies claim that cells from the surface are still active at a pressure of 1 gigapascal (GPa). There are also piezophiles for which optimal growth occurs at pressures over 100 MPa, and some do not grow in pressures less than 50 MPa. As of 2019, most sampling of organisms from the deep ocean and subsurface undergo decompression when they are removed to the surface. This can harm the cells in a variety of ways, and experiments at surface pressures produce an inaccurate picture of microbial activity in the deep biosphere. A Pressurized Underwater Sampler Handler (PUSH50) has been developed to maintain in situ pressure during sampling and afterwards in the laboratory. = Temperature = High temperatures stress organisms, increasing the rates of processes that damage important molecules such as DNA and amino acids. It also increases the energy requirements for repairing these molecules. However, cells can respond by changing the structure of these molecules to stabilize them. Microbes can survive at temperatures above 100¬∞C if the pressure is high enough to keep the water from boiling. The highest temperature at which an organism has been cultured in a laboratory is 122¬∞C, under pressures of 20 and 40 megapascals. Theoretical estimates for the highest temperature that can sustain life are around 150¬∞C. The 120¬∞C isotherm can be less than 10 meters deep at mid-ocean ridges and seamounts, but in other environments such as deep-sea trenches it can be kilometers deep. About 39% by volume of ocean sediments is at temperatures between 40¬∞C and 120¬∞C. The record-setting thermophile, Methanopyrus kandlerii, was isolated from a hydrothermal vent. Hydrothermal vents provide abundant energy and nutrients. Several groups of Archaea and Bacteria thrive in the shallow seafloor at temperatures between 80 and 105¬∞C. In more energy-limited environments, cells are expected to have lower limits on the temperature. Although microbial signatures have been detected at temperatures up to 100¬∞C in cored sediments, attempts to isolate the organisms have failed. No microbial activity has been seen in deep oil reservoirs hotter than 80¬∞C, and the limit may be as low as 60¬∞C in deeply buried sediments. = Living with energy limitation = In most of the subsurface, organisms live in conditions of extreme energy and nutrient limitation. This is far from the conditions in which cells are cultured in labs. A lab culture goes through a series of predictable phases. After a short lag phase, there is a period of exponential growth in which the population can double in as little as 20 minutes. A death phase follows in which almost all the cells die off. The remainder enter an extended stationary phase in which they can last for years without further input of substrate. However, each live cell has 100 to 1000 dead cells to feed on, so they still have abundant nutrients compared to the subsurface. In the subsurface, cells catabolize (break down molecules for energy or building materials) 10,000 to one million times slower than at the surface. Biomass may take centuries or millennia to turn over. There is no known limit to the age that cells could reach. The viruses that are present could kill cells and there may be grazing by eukaryotes, but there is no evidence of that. It is difficult to establish clear limits on the energy needed to keep cells alive but not growing. They need energy to perform certain basic functions like the maintenance of osmotic pressure and maintenance of macromolecules such as enzymes and RNA (e.g., proofreading and synthesis). However, laboratory estimates of the energy needed are several orders of magnitude greater than the energy supply that appears to sustain life underground. It was thought, at first, that most underground cells are dormant. However, some extra energy is required to come out of dormancy. This is not a good strategy in an environment where the energy sources are stable over millions of years but decreasing slowly. The available evidence suggests that most cells in the subsurface are active and viable. A low-energy environment favors cells with minimal self-regulation, because there are no changes in the environment that they need to respond to. There could be low- energy specialists. However, there is unlikely to be strong evolutionary pressure for such organisms to evolve because of the low turnover and because the environment is a dead end.  Diversity  The biomass in the deep subsurface is about 15% of the total for the biosphere. Life from all three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya) have been found in the deep subsurface; indeed, the deep subsurface accounts for about 90% of all the biomass in Archaea and Bacteria. The genetic diversity is at least as great as that on the surface. In the ocean, plankton species are distributed globally and are constantly being deposited almost everywhere. Quite different communities are found even in the top of ocean floor, and species diversity decreases with depth. However, there are still some taxa that are widespread in the subsurface. In marine sediments, the main bacterial phyla are \\"Candidatus Atribacteria\\" (formerly OP9 and JS1), Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes. Members of Archaea were first identified using metagenomic analysis; some of them have since been cultured and they have acquired new names. The Deep Sea Archaeal Group (DSAG) became the Marine Benthic Group B (MBG-B) and is now a proposed phylum \\"Lokiarchaeota\\". Along with the former Ancient Archaeal Group (AAG) and Marine Hydrothermal Vent Group (MHVG), \\"Lokiarchaeota\\" is part of a candidate superphylum, Asgard. Other phyla are \\"Bathyarchaeota\\" (formerly the Miscellaneous Chrenarchaeotal Group), Thaumarchaeota (formerly Marine Group I), and Euryarchaeota (including \\"Hadesarchaea\\", Archaeoglobales and Thermococcales). A related clade, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME), is also represented. Other bacterial phyla include Thermotogae. In the continental subsurface, the main bacterial groups are Proteobacteria and Firmicutes while the Archaea are mainly Methanomicrobia and Thaumarchaeota. Other phyla include \\"Bathyarchaeota\\" and \\"Aigarchaeota\\", while bacterial phyla include Aquificae and Nitrospirae. The eukarya in the deep biosphere include some multicellular life. In 2009 a species of nematode, Halicephalobus mephisto, was discovered in rock fissures more than a kilometer down a South African gold mine. Nicknamed the \\"devil worm\\", it may have been forced down along with pore water by earthquakes. Other multicellular organisms have since been found, including fungi, Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Rotifera, Annelida (ringed worms) and Arthropoda. However, their range may be limited because sterols, needed to construct membranes in eukarya, are not easily made in anaerobic conditions. Viruses are also present in large numbers and infect a diverse range of microbes in the deep biosphere. They may contribute significantly to cell turnover and transfer of genetic information between cells.  Habitats  Environments in which subsurface life has been found. Life has been found at depths of 5 km in continents and 10.5 km below the ocean surface. In 1992, Thomas Gold calculated that if the estimated pore space of the terrestrial land mass down to 5 km depth was filled with water, and if 1% of this volume were microbial biomass, it would be enough living matter to cover Earth's land surface with a 1.5 m thick layer. The estimated volume of the deep biosphere is 2‚Äì2.3 billion cubic kilometers, about twice the volume of the oceans. = Ocean floor = The main types of habitat below the seafloor are sediments and igneous rock. The latter may be partially altered and coexist with its alteration products such as sulfides and carbonates. In rock, chemicals are mainly carried through an aquifer system that cycles all of the ocean's water every 200,000 years. In sediments below the top few centimeters, chemicals mainly spread by the much slower process of diffusion.  Sediments  Nearly all of the seafloor is covered by marine sediments. They can vary in thickness from centimeters near ocean ridges to over 10 kilometers in deep trenches. In the mid-ocean, coccoliths and shells settling down from the surface form oozes, while near shore sediment is carried from the continents by rivers. Minerals from hydrothermal vents and wind-blown particles also contribute. As organic matter is deposited and buried, the more easily utilized compounds are depleted by microbial oxidation, leaving the more recalcitrant compounds. Thus, the energy available for life declines. In the top few meters, metabolic rates decline by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude, and throughout the sediment column cell numbers decline with depth. Sediments form layers with different conditions for life. In the top 5‚Äì10 centimeters, animals burrow, reworking the sediment and extending the sediment-water interface. The water carries oxygen, fresh organic matter and dissolved metabolites, resulting in a heterogenous environment with abundant nutrients. Below the burrowed layer is a layer dominated by sulfate reduction. Below that, the anaerobic reduction of methane is facilitated by sulfate in the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). Once the sulfates are depleted, methane formation takes over. The depth of the chemical zones depends on the rate that organic matter is deposited. Where it is rapid, oxygen is taken up rapidly as organic matter is consumed; where slow, oxygen can persist much deeper because of the lack of nutrients to oxidize. Ocean sediment habitats can be divided into subduction zones, abyssal plains, and passive margins. At a subduction zone, where one plate is diving under another, a thick wedge of sediment tends to form. At first the sediment has 50 to 60 percent porosity; as it is compressed, fluids are expelled to form cold seeps or gas hydrates. Abyssal plains are the region between continental margins and mid-ocean ridges, usually at depths below 4 kilometers. The ocean surface is very poor in nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and iron, limiting the growth of phytoplankton; this results in low sedimentation rates. The sediment tends to be very poor in nutrients, so not all the oxygen is consumed; oxygen has been found all the way down to the underlying rock. In such environments, cells are mostly either strictly aerobic or facultative anaerobic (using oxygen where available but able to switch to other electron acceptors in its absence) and they are heterotrophic (not primary producers). They include Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Marine Group II archaea and lithoautotrophs in the Thaumarchaeota phylum. Fungi are diverse, including members of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla as well as yeasts Passive margins (continental shelves and slopes) are under relatively shallow water. Upwelling brings nutrient-rich water to the surface, stimulating abundant growth of phytoplankton, which then settles to the bottom (a phenomenon known as the biological pump). Thus, there is a lot of organic material in the sediments, and all the oxygen is used up in its consumption. They have very stable temperature and pressure profiles. The population of microbes is orders of magnitude greater than in the abyssal plains. It includes strict anaerobes including members of the Chloroflexi phylum, \\"Ca. Atribacteria\\", sulfate-reducing bacteria, and fermenters, methanogens and methanotrophs in the Archaea. Fungi are less diverse than in abyssal plains, mainly including Ascomycota and yeasts. Viruses in the Inoviridae, Siphoviridae and Lipothrixviridae families have been identified.  Rocks  Schematic of the Sumatra Trench and the associated island arcs and back- arc regions Ocean crust forms at mid-ocean ridges and is removed by subduction. The top half kilometer or so is a series of basaltic flows, and only this layer has enough porosity and permeability to allow fluid flow. Less suitable for life are the layers of sheeted dikes and gabbros underneath. Mid- ocean ridges are a hot, rapidly changing environment with a steep vertical temperature gradient, so life can only exist in the top few meters. High- temperature interactions between water and rock reduce sulfates, producing abundant sulfides that serve as energy sources; they also strip the rock of metals that can be sources of energy or toxic. Along with degassing from magma, water interactions also produce a lot of methane and hydrogen. No drilling has yet been accomplished, so information on microbes comes from samples of hydrothermal fluids coming out of vents. About 5 kilometers off the ridge axis, when the crust is about 1 million years old, ridge flanks begin. Characterized by hydrothermal circulation, they extend to about 80 million years in age. This circulation is driven by latent heat from the cooling of crust, which heats seawater and drives it up through more permeable rock. Energy sources come from alteration of the rock, some of which is mediated by living organisms. In the younger crust, there is a lot of iron and sulfur cycling. Sediment cover slows the cooling and reduces the flow of water. There is little evidence of microbe activity in older (more than 10 million year old) crust. Near subduction zones, volcanoes can form in island arcs and back- arc regions. The subducting plate releases volatiles and solutes to these volcanoes, resulting in acidic fluids with higher concentrations of gases and metals than in the mid-ocean ridge. It also releases water that can mix with mantle material to form serpentinite. When hotspot volcanoes occur in the middle of oceanic plates, they create permeable and porous basalts with higher concentrations of gas than at mid-ocean ridges. Hydrothermal fluids are cooler and have a lower sulfide content. Iron-oxidizing bacteria create extensive deposits of iron oxides.  Porewater  Microorganisms live in the cracks, holes and empty space inside sediments and rocks. Such empty space provides water and dissolved nutrients to the microorganisms. Note that as the depth increases, there are less nutrients in the porewater as nutrients are continuously consumed by microorganisms. As the depth increases, the sediment is more compact and there is less space between mineral grains. As a result, there is less porewater per volume. The environment gets drier and drier when sediments are transitioned into rocks. At this stage, water can also be a limiting factor to the deep biosphere.  Continents  Continents have a complex history and a great variety of rocks, sediments and soils; the climate on the surface, temperature profiles and hydrology also vary. Most of the information on subsurface life comes from a small number of sampling sites that are mainly in North America. With the exception of ice cores, densities of cells decline steeply with depth, decreasing by several orders of magnitude. In the top one or two meters of soils, organisms depend on oxygen and are heterotrophs, depending on the breakdown of organic carbon for their nutrition, and their decline in density parallels that of the organic material. Below that, there is no correlation, although both cell density and organic content declines by a further five orders of magnitude or so (by contrast, there is a correlation in ocean sediments). Increasing depth, temperature and salinity do correlate with declining cell numbers, although the rates depend strongly on type of crust and rate of groundwater recharge. Microbes have been found in sedimentary rocks down to about 3 kilometers, the deepest sampled. There is a lot of diversity, although the deepest tend to be iron(III)- or sulfate-reducing bacteria that use fermentation and can thrive in high temperature and salinity. Even more salt-tolerant halophiles have been found in deep salt deposits, and such deposits are found all over the world. In 2019 microbial organisms were discovered living 2,400 meters below the surface, breathing sulfur and eating rocks such as pyrite as their regular food source. The discovery occurred in the oldest known water on Earth. Humans have accessed deep aquifers in igneous rocks for a variety of purposes including groundwater extraction, mining, and storage of hazardous wastes. Most or all of these aquifers host microbes. At all the sites that have been tested, hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide have been found. Hydrogen-based communities of prokaryotes have also been found in hot springs and hydrothermal systems. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed for the production of hydrogen, some of which would be independent of photosynthesis.  Ecology  The purplish rod-shaped cells, a few microns long, are \\"Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator\\". One species of Bacteria, \\"Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator\\", is the first known to comprise a complete ecosystem by itself. It was found 2.8 kilometers below the surface in a gold mine near Johannesburg, South Africa. In alkaline water at a temperature of about 60¬∞C, with no access to oxygen, it gets energy by reducing sulfate, its nitrogen from ammonia molecules and ammonium ions, and its carbon from carbon dioxide or formate. Other ecosystems have multiple interdependent species. They can be divided into autotrophs, which derive energy from non-living sources, and heterotrophs, which feed on autotrophs or their remains. Some organisms engage in syntrophy, where one organism lives off the byproducts of another's metabolic activity. At the surface, most autotrophs use photosynthesis, but where there is no light, chemoautotrophs make use of chemical energy. In marine sediments where oxygen is available, a major group of chemoautotrophs is ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota. It supports 19% of the heterotrophic production. In some environments such as abyssal Pacific Ocean sediments, the supply of ammonia dwindles with depth; but in other environments ammonia actually increases because heterotrophic bacteria, living on organic material, remineralize the ammonia. This interdependence of the heterotrophic bacteria and Thaumarchaeota is an example of syntrophy. However, some Thaumarchaeota are mixotrophic, able to use both organic matter and carbon dioxide for carbon. In anoxic sediments, hydrogen is an important \\"edible\\". Members of the Chloroflexi draw energy from it to produce acetate by reducing carbon dioxide or organic matter (a process known as acetogenesis). Metal-reducing and sugar- fermenting Bacteroidetes produce propionate, among other compounds, and this is fermented by \\"Ca. Atribacteria\\" to produce hydrogen. In upper sediments, sulfate-reducing bacteria take up most of the hydrogen, while in lower sediments the sulfate is depleted and methanogens dominate. In the sulfate- methane transition zone (SMTZ), anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME) archaea form consortia with sulfate-reducing bacteria.

He served as the Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina from 1792 to 1794, and was a member of the South Carolina state Senate from 1800 to 1804. The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen is descended both from his son James H. Ladson and from his daughter Elizabeth Ladson, and by adoption additionally from his daughter Sarah Reeve Ladson; von der Leyen lived under the name Rose Ladson in London in the late 1970s. Early life James Ladson was born in 1753 in Charleston to a prominent South Carolinian family of English origin. He was the son of William Ladson and Anne Gibbes. His great- grandfather John Ladson emigrated from Northamptonshire in England to Barbados and then to Carolina as one of the first English settlers in 1679, where he built a large plantation and served in the Commons House of Assembly from 1685.Mary Preston Foster, Charleston: A Historic Walking Tour, p. 31 His mother was the daughter of the prominent colonial official Colonel John Gibbes (1696‚Äì1764) and the granddaughter of the colonial governor Robert Gibbes. The Gibbes Museum of Art is named for his mother's family. James Ladson was also a 2nd great-grandson of Henry Woodward, the first British colonist in Carolina. Following the early death of his parents he was raised by his uncle John Gibbes (1733‚Äì1780), who owned the Grove Plantation that included today's Hampton Park and its surrounding neighbourhoods. He attended the best schools in South Carolina. In 1773 he traveled to England to pursue his education, returning to South Carolina the following year.

They are sorted by introduction to the main cast. =Mark Greene= =Doug Ross= =Susan Lewis= =John Carter= =Carol Hathaway= =Peter Benton= =Jeanie Boulet= =Kerry Weaver= =Anna Del Amico= =Elizabeth Corday= =Lucy Knight= =Robert Romano= =Luka Kovaƒç= =Cleo Finch= =Dave Malucci= =Abby Lockhart= =Jing-Mei Chen= =Michael Gallant= Michael Emory Gallant was a regular character from 2001 to 2004 (seasons 8‚Äì10). Gallant first appears at County General Hospital in late 2001 as a medical student in his third year. Coming from a family with a military background, he had previously been on active duty as a member of the US Army Reserve, who is paying for his scholarship. During his time as a student there, he was assigned to Dr. Carter. He initially clashes with Dr. Pratt, a brash new intern who disparages Gallant's abilities. It comes to a breaking point early on when Pratt cracks a patient's chest without supervision and ropes in Gallant to help. However, over time, the two eventually become firm friends. Shortly after arriving (season 8), Gallant accompanies Dr. Weaver to the scene of an ambulance that had been transporting a pregnant woman to hospital and been trapped under fallen power lines. While there, the power lines explode and Gallant saves a fireman from electrocution. He then helps Weaver deliver the pregnant woman's baby. The event gives Weaver a lot of respect for Gallant and his ability to keep his head under pressure. In the following year (season 9), Gallant becomes close to fellow medical student Erin Harkins, though their relationship remains platonic. Later on in the year, Pratt and Gallant are arrested on suspicion of being the two gunmen at the 'Doc Magoos' shooting. Although they are innocent, and subsequently released, the incident shakes Gallant and his faith in the fairness and equality of the police. By the end of his time at County as a medical student, Gallant decides to apply as an Emergency Medicine intern and matches to County. Despite being a full-fledged doctor, he doesn't have any easier time. Only a few months in to his internship, a helicopter crashes in the ambulance bay and Gallant is in the thick of the action. Later that year, Gallant's sister comes to visit and during her stay, she spends the night with Pratt, which strains Gallant and Pratt's friendship, although they manage to remain friends. At the beginning of Season 10, new medical student Neela Rasgotra has started her rotation at County. During this time, Gallant is keen in helping her settle in. Around April, Neela accidentally gives a patient the wrong medication. However, Gallant, who is supervising at the time, takes the blame When he is told he will be investigated, he reveals he has been called up for service, forcing the administrators to drop the investigation. He then soon reveals that he had feelings for her. However, before they can start a relationship, Gallant reveals to Neela that he has been called up to go to Iraq. They argue, but part on good terms. Although Gallant had now left County as a regular character, he appeared in a few episodes during the following two seasons. In season 11, one episode kept jumping between County and Iraq. Gallant is now working in a military hospital (holding the rank of Captain). At one point, while out working in the field he is wounded by an Iraqi gunman. Gallant manages to shoot and kill his assailant before he can fire again. The incident haunts him, however. As well as treating injured US soldiers, Gallant's unit also treats injured Iraqi civilians. One day, a young girl arrives with severe burns, and Gallant insists that she has to be saved. With his commanding officer's blessing, Gallant organizes for the girl to be treated at County (with Neela's help). He returns to the US with the girl and while on 72 hours leave, he renews his relationship with Neela. He returns to Iraq soon after. The following season, Gallant returns home to finish his training as a doctor. Overjoyed in seeing each other again, Gallant and Neela make an impulsive decision to get married. They buy a house together and look ready to start a whole new life together. However, Gallant has a few emotional scars from the war; he revealed to Neela that he is going to counseling sessions for veterans, before revealing that he wants to finish his training in Iraq, by volunteering for a second tour of duty. Neela is shocked and angry with Gallant, but realizes that there is nothing she can do or say to stop him from going. For the third time, the two lovers part. Gallant makes his final appearance in the penultimate episode of Season 12 \\"The Gallant Hero and the Tragic Victor.\\" He is on a convoy of trucks, when the unit is ambushed by Iraqi insurgents. Gallant goes to the aid of a fallen officer and the convoy manages to escape. Gallant is unable to save the officer, however. Just as he has settled back down, a roadside bomb hits the truck and Gallant and the men on the truck were killed instantly. Two officers visit the ER later on and inform Neela of his death. The whole ER is shocked, especially Pratt, who takes his death hard. Gallant's belongings are given to Neela and it is revealed that he recorded himself on tape as a message to her just in case he died. On the tape, Michael apologizes to Neela for leaving her for Iraq. During the 15th and final season of ER, at the end of the episode \\"The Book of Abby\\", long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Among them, the tag \\"Gallant\\" can be seen. =Greg Pratt= =Neela Rasgotra= =Samantha Taggart= =Ray Barnett= Ray Barnett is introduced in the eleventh-season premiere as a resident under the supervision of Dr. John Carter. He is a rebel and sometimes gets into trouble with his superiors, to the point that Chief of Staff Kerry Weaver gives him an ultimatum when he asks license to go on tour with his rock band. Weaver gets him to choose between his medical career and music. In the end, even at the suggestion of his bandmates, Barnett chooses medicine. Barnett becomes Neela Rasgotra's roommate and starts to develop feelings for her, but he has a girlfriend named Katey, and Neela is married to Michael Gallant. Neela is also attracted to Barnett, but they never get into a formal relationship, even after Gallant's death. Their relationship becomes even more complicated with the arrival of Tony Gates. During Abby Lockhart and Luka Kovaƒç's wedding, Barnett and Gates start a fight, which leads Barnett to leave the place, only to be hit by a truck immediately afterwards. As a result of this, Barnett loses both legs and moves back to Baton Rouge to live with his mother. The character returns one last time near the end of the series, having received two prostheses. He explains that he works in rehabilitation, helping disabled and amputee patients. It is also revealed that he still has feelings for Neela. Neela decides to leave Chicago and move with Ray, to work in the same hospital. Ray Barnett is portrayed by Shane West. =Archie Morris= Dr. Archibald \\"Archie\\" Morris is a fictional character portrayed by Scott Grimes on the television show ER. The character of Dr. Morris debuts in late 2003, in the drama's 10th season, and is initially notable for providing comic relief. Morris is initially an inept second-year resident who avoids work whenever possible. Luckily, he is frequently bailed out by another resident named Nick Cooper. In the episode \\"Freefall\\", Morris is caught smoking confiscated marijuana by Dr. Robert Romano, but avoids punishment when Romano is killed by a falling helicopter in the ambulance bay. Unaware of the doctor's demise, Morris, stoned, waits at the admit desk to be disciplined, doing nothing to assist the other doctors as they deal with the fiery crash. Morris's lack of commitment and slacking have already been well-established when his neglect costs a patient's life. The patient waits for hours to be seen by a doctor before she has a stroke and dies. Morris abruptly quits, storming out of the ER, only to return the next day claiming his father would deny him financial support if he didn't see this \\"thing\\" through. Morris is made Chief Resident in season 11, allowing his character to further antagonize other characters (Grimes became a series regular at this time). He achieves this coveted position because of a lack of competition (the more capable Greg Pratt turns down the post), an eleventh hour push of publications, and an elaborate presentation for the interview. As Chief Resident, Morris's inflated ego often leads to clashes with colleagues, though he often acts as if he were beloved by his residents and medical students. Although Luka Kovac never has any disagreements with him, Ray Barnett, Neela Rasgotra and especially Abby Lockhart tend to mock and insult him for his pompous attitude, although in later years they regard him with grudging affection. Greg Pratt is initially also contemptuous of Morris, but by season 12 they are good friends. Kerry Weaver, on the other hand, although never openly rude to Morris, never views him as having much potential and does not support him as much as other ER doctors; she only gave him support as Chief Resident because he was, in her words, \\"a paperwork hound\\". Morris's leadership style swings wildly from delegation to micro-management. At the end of season 11, when Dr. Carter leaves the hospital, he tells Morris to \\"set the tone\\" just as Mark Greene had told him at the end of season 8. Morris is drunk at the time and doesn't recall the phrase when Carter asks him years later. In season 12, it is revealed that Morris donated sperm many times earlier in his life. Four red- headed children, one of whom is African American, show up at the hospital and declare that Morris is their father. Although shocked by this, his comical attempts to be a \\"good dad\\" become a recurring theme for the character in subsequent episodes; the kids do love him, however. Later in the season, we learn that Morris has been hired by a pharmacy laboratory. In the season finale, \\"21 Guns,\\" he is preparing to leave the hospital when a shooting occurs in the ER. Morris's quick and competent response to this crisis marks something of a professional turning point for him. During season 13, Morris is hired as one of the ER's attending physicians (the slot left open by Dr. Clemente's departure). Morris begins a serious effort to win respect. Though other doctors still do not always take him seriously, he shows a moment of both care and skill when he correctly interpreted a young man's alternating demands to be admitted and discharged as symptoms of dissociative identity disorder. However, other doctors laugh at Morris's diagnosis and refused to authorize critical care, and he privately admits to Sam Taggart that he knows \\"most of the other ER staff think I'm a joke.\\" Sam speaks kindly to him and then uses her communications skills to convince the patient to consent to life-saving treatment. This is where Morris slowly starts to become a much better doctor. When new medical interns come to the ER, Morris's attention is caught by Hope Bobeck. Morris asks her out for dinner but she instead invites him to her Bible study group, as she is a born-again Christian (often praying while taking care of patients). Morris pretends to be as devout as she is, and Hope and Morris grow close to each other. In the Christmas episode City of Mercy, he gets through a difficult shift as the only ER attending, and at the end of the day Hope tells him how much she has learned watching him. She then asks him out for drinks, with the implication of intimacy to follow. Morris declines, much to his own surprise, recognising that she is lonely and he would be jeopardising a longer-term relationship by taking advantage of that. Morris and Hope later get involved with each other while helping to plan Luka and Abby's wedding. The two take advantage of a honeymoon suite that Luka and Abby are not able to use and begin pursuing a relationship. Morris was saddened when Hope leaves for a long volunteer stint in Venezuela, and they subsequently break up. In season 14, Morris discovers that his father has died, and laments to Abby that he and his dad never mended their long-broken relationship. He also fails his medical boards while Dr. Pratt passes them. Morris lies about his failure and asks Pratt to cover for him until he can take and pass his boards. Morris also undergoes brief therapy sessions after a hostage situation he was involved in, where the armed man was gunned down right after he gave himself up. Another hard hit comes when his friend Dr. Gregory Pratt is critically injured in an ambulance explosion and the ER staff are unable to save him. Morris takes Dr. Pratt's death harder than anyone else in the ER. In the following weeks, he clashes numerous times with the new chief Catherine Banfield whom Morris resents upon her arrival, seeing that she holds the position his deceased friend had earned. In the following weeks, Morris gets in trouble with Dr. Banfield for teaching new med student Chaz Pratt risky medical procedures that not even first year residents are qualified to perform. Morris admits that whenever he sees Chaz, he sees his brother Greg, and only wants to do the best for him. As season 15 progresses, Morris is shown to have matured a great deal following Pratt's death, becoming the senior figure for the doctors in the ER, much like Mark Greene and John Carter before him. In many instances, his co-workers come to him for both personal and professional advice, although he retains his slightly comical personality. Specifically, Dr. Cate Banfield shares with him the fact that her young son died in the County ER, and Dr. Brenner admits to Morris that he was sexually abused as a child. Additionally, upon returning to the ER, John Carter notes that Morris took his advice on setting the tone. In the episode Separation Anxiety, Morris becomes attracted to a female patient whom he later learns is an undercover narcotics cop (Claudia Diaz, played by Justina Machado). In the episode \\"I Feel Good\\", Morris tells Claudia that he plans to one day propose to her, which she says she would accept. =Tony Gates= =Simon Brenner = Simon Brenner is introduced as a new ER attending physician, first seen in bed with two women before arriving for his first shift. His character is superficially very charming, especially with the ladies. While Brenner is a talented physician, he is unwilling to share his knowledge and teach the new medical students. Even when consistently reminded that Brenner works in a teaching hospital, he still refuses to teach procedures to those who need or want the practice. He sleeps with one med student and later insults both her romantic and professional skills. When Pratt informs Dr. Anspaugh of Brenner's attitude, it is revealed that Brenner is Anspaugh's nephew. At the end of season 14, Simon and Neela get into a heated argument in which she told him he was only at County because of his family ties to Anspaugh, attacked his attitude and told him no one else wanted him around. This leads to them sleeping together. They do so again in Season 15 and continue to spar like an old married couple. Simon is later shown with a girlfriend who is doing a thesis on Middle Eastern politics at the University of Chicago. Towards the end of Season 15 Neela tells him they have no romantic future together, although the pair eventually end their relationship amicably. In the episode \\"Age of Innocence\\", it is revealed that Brenner was molested as a child by his mother's boyfriend. Morris wants him to get help to deal with the trauma, but Brenner tells him he is dealing with \\"in my own way\\". Later in \\"Shifting Equilibrium\\", Brenner is shown to be visiting a therapist and coming to terms with having been abused. The series finale, \\"And in the End...\\", also shows Brenner mentoring and giving support to new medical student Julia Wise (Alexis Bledel) after the death of a patient. Simon Brenner is portrayed by David Lyons. =Catherine Banfield= Supporting characters =Secondary doctors= Donald Anspaugh Donald Anspaugh is a surgeon working at County General as well as the chief of staff and a member of the hospital board. The character was appointed County General's new chief of staff after South Side closed and merged with County. In his early appearances, Anspaugh was portrayed as a by-the-book doctor. In season four it is revealed that his son Scott (portrayed by Trevor Morgan) has B-cell lymphoma. The cancer had previously gone into remission but has come back. Scott wants to give up and it is only through a personal connection with Jeanie Boulet in the ER that his spirits are raised. Noticing how well Boulet and his son relate, Anspaugh asks Jeanie to be his son's part-time private caregiver. She agrees and a deep friendship develops between Scott and Jeanie. Scott eventually dies. In 1999 Anspaugh resigned as chief of staff because of his son's death and was replaced by Robert Romano. He remained both a surgeon and a leading board member but his exact position was unspecified for several seasons. He, along with Peter Benton, succeeds in saving John Carter's life after Carter and medical student Lucy Knight were stabbed by a patient. Anspaugh was present during Carter's intervention meeting when Carter's post- stabbing drug addiction was discovered at the end of season 6. At the end of season 8, he was among those who paid their respects at Mark Greene's funeral and assisted in the smallpox evacuation, trying to save Dr. Romano from losing his arm. Toward the end of Season 9, Anspaugh fired Romano over his insubordinate attitude and gave Kerry Weaver the job. In season 11's episode 19, Anspaugh's job again seems to change; he describes himself to Abby Lockhart as \\"the chief of surgery.\\" He also participated in Susan Lewis' tenure-review panel. Anspaugh later resurfaced in Season 12 to deal with the lawsuit issue caused by Clemente. In the second episode of season 13, Weaver herself told him that it was her fault that Clemente kept working at County as long as he did, despite concerns from the staff and mishaps before. Dr. Anspaugh was originally going to fire Luka Kovac until Weaver spoke up. Afterwards, he immediately decided to relieve Dr. Weaver of her position of chief of staff, which he took over himself until a full-time successor was found. In Season 14, Greg Pratt appealed to Dr. Anspaugh to have him replace Kevin Moretti as Chief of Emergency Medicine, a proposal Anspaugh refused to accept despite Pratt's persistent efforts, citing Pratt's lack of leadership initiative and youth. Anspaugh opted to promote Skye Wexler instead. Dr. Anspaugh is seen throughout season 14, interviewing Dr. Pratt for the Chief's job, promoting Dr. Wexler and informing the ER of Dr. Moretti's departure and later meeting with Abby Lockhart and the rest of the board after her rehab stint. He then met with her again when she interviewed for an attending position. Victor Clemente Victor Clemente first appears in the 250th episode of ER, \\"Wake Up\\", as a new attending physician from Newark who is seeking the Chief of Emergency Medicine position vacated by Susan Lewis and attempting to introduce modern equipment and diagnostics to the ER. He enters the series in an unusual way, by posing as a patient. This causes confusion and some irritation from doctors Abby Lockhart, Archie Morris, Gregory Pratt and especially Luka Kovaƒç. Clemente and Kovaƒç clash over just about every case that comes through the ER, and Kovaƒç is so annoyed by Clemente that he decides to seek the ER Chief job for himself. Kovaƒç's main complaint with Clemente is that, regardless of whether Clemente is right or not, he will take the initiative on procedures whether he has the approval/opinion of other Attendings. Even if everyone working on a patient is against Clemente, he always seems to get away with it because Kerry Weaver (who hired him) likes his credentials. In the end, Kovaƒç does become Chief, after which Clemente claims to have earlier decided not to seek the position, citing time constraints; Kovaƒç nonetheless takes steps to rein in Clemente's independent streak. The audience soon learns that Clemente is not the consummate professional he was originally portrayed as. Clemente's former girlfriend Jodie (portrayed by Callie Thorne), whose relationship with Victor in Newark caused unspecified problems that Kerry Weaver said were not his fault, tracks him down to Chicago and initiates a new relationship between them. This causes Clemente to become careless and even miss work to stay with her. Eventually, Jodie's controlling husband Bobby (a violent police officer who apparently beats her) appears in his apartment. He shoots both Clemente and Jodie after Jodie asks for a divorce. Clemente has relatively minor injuries while Jodie ends up in a coma. Clemente becomes the prime suspect of shooting her and himself due to the cocaine found in his apartment and the fact that records in New Jersey show that Jodie's husband supposedly worked on the day of the shooting. Clemente is subjected to drug tests and is kept under close watch by Luka Kovaƒç and other staff; Kovaƒç wants him gone but neither he nor Kerry take any steps to fire Victor from his job. Jodie does survive and gets Clemente out of trouble by telling the cops what really occurred, but more problems occur when Bobby continues to harass Clemente by phone, stalk him by car, leave threats and make other comments to him. The comments indicate that he had tried to frame Clemente for an unspecified crime in Newark. In the episode \\"The Gallant Hero and the Tragic Victor\\", Clemente finally succumbs to the troubles plaguing him. Clemente's behavior includes relieving himself in public, property damage, and threats of violence. He is hospitalized at County and medically classified as being in an altered psychiatric state. A psychiatric consultant rules his peculiar behavior is caused by posttraumatic stress disorder or sleep deprivation, presumably from his vigilance in avoiding his stalker. In the Season 12 finale \\"Twenty-One Guns,\\" Luka Kovaƒç states that Clemente has been fired from his position at County. Weaver faces stern questions from Dr. Anspaugh when a former patient files a lawsuit against Clemente and he is listed on a medical watchdog website as a bad doctor, leading to her throwing Kovaƒç under the bus (to his visible disbelief). When the board plans to fire Kovaƒç over his Weaver-insinuated negligence in Clemente's hiring and terrible history at County, she finally admits she was responsible for those problems, and is demoted from her chief of staff position, which also contributes to her departure altogether in Season 13. Janet Coburn Janet Coburn is the head of the OB department at County General Hospital, serving in that position throughout the entire run of the series (although her character appears in only 26 episodes of the show's 15 seasons). Coburn is frequently portrayed in some kind of conflict with the ER staff, most notably in her first appearance in season 1 when Mark Greene mis-diagnosed Jodi O'Brien who later died as a result. Her other appearances often revolve around the various pregnancies of different characters in the show, including Carol Hathaway, Elizabeth Corday-Greene, Chloe Lewis, and Abby Lockhart. Coburn later in the series revealed she once had a drinking problem and has since become Abby's Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor; she acts as both a no-nonsense mentor and a friend to Abby through the series. Coburn convinced Abby to get back into a program after she started drinking again, and also convinced her to fly to Croatia to make amends with Luka after revealing she was unfaithful. Dr. Coburn later appeared in season 15 to assist Dr. Rasgotra with a pregnant patient, and advise Dr. Banfield on IVF treatment. Maggie Doyle Maggie Doyle was an intern during season 3 and a resident during seasons 4 and 5. Maggie's older sister (by three years) is identified as a former classmate of Carol Hathaway in a Catholic school. In the ER, she became friends with John Carter, who became attracted to her, but it is later revealed that she is a lesbian. During season 5, she accuses Dr. Romano of sexual harassment. She asked Elizabeth Corday to back her up, but Corday refused when Romano blackmailed her using some personal information. Kerry Weaver started an investigation and forced Romano to retract an inaccurate, critical review of Maggie's job performance, but this did not prevent Maggie from leaving the ER. Her absence from the show was not explained, but in the season 7 episode \\"Rampage\\" when Weaver & Romano were arguing over Dr. Legaspi's termination, Weaver suggested that Maggie Doyle was forced out due to Romano's dislike (which he never directly admitted to) of gay people. Doyle could have left her job in the ER after the mess of the sexual harassment lawsuit she had on Romano was never going to be pursued. 9 years later in the season 15 episode \\"The Book of Abby\\", long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Amongst them, the tag \\"Doyle\\" can be seen, the only former doctor on the wall to have not been a main character. In real life, Fox left ER because she kept getting larger roles on successful drama shows, starting with The West Wing and peaking with her work as Sara Sidle on the hit show CBS drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Lucien Dubenko Lucien Dubenko is the current Chief of Surgery. He was first introduced shortly before Elizabeth Corday departed, as an arrogant but obviously talented surgeon, bragging about, and then showing his ability to run the bowel with a laparoscope. Dr. Corday bitterly protests his hiring to Kerry Weaver but presents no real reason for her hostility and leaves Kerry confused and annoyed about why Corday \\"is taking this so personally\\". Corday's anger causes her to conduct an illegal organ transplant between two HIV+ men, which leads to her being reprimanded and being forced to take a demotion. Corday eventually quits the hospital altogether, though Dubenko praises her actions in doing the transplant. Dubenko is portrayed as a very dedicated and talented surgeon, with a keen interest in medical science, lecturing the interns on physiology. Dubenko becomes friends with residents Abby Lockhart and Neela Rasgotra, and later seems to fall for both of them, most notably Neela after she becomes a surgical intern. He did his trauma fellowship at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, MD.\\"Officer Down\\". ER. Season 14. Episode 3. Due to his connections, he helps Tony Gates get a 13-year-old ICU patient into a clinical trial there. He has an older sister named Victoria who lives in an assisted-care facility in Evanston, IL because she was in a car crash on prom night caused by her drunken teenage boyfriend that left her with brain damage at age 17. He was 15 at the time.\\"City of Mercy\\". ER. Season 13. Episode 11. He mentions an ex-wife.\\"I Do\\". ER. Season 12. Episode 9. After he discovers he has prostate cancer in Season 12, he asks Abby to have sex with him to make sure he is fully functioning after surgery, but reacts with equanimity when she declines the offer. During Luka and Abby's wedding, he asks Luka to take care of Abby. He was involved in a \\"friends with benefits\\" relationship with new ER Chief Dr. Skye Wexler, which later ended after he lashed out at her for excluding him from her life and accused her of being a slut. He later resigned in protest over the death of patient Sheryl Hawkins, when he had to leave the OR and leave Dr. Rasgotra (Junior Resident) to finish the operation, because he was the only surgical attending available in the hospital, this outburst enraged Dr. Anspaugh during the M&M.; Efforts by Neela and Simon Brenner led to his return in Season 15, and he later justly criticized Neela for her dismissive attitude towards teaching surgical residents by giving her the choice of doing her job well or getting the hell out of County (she took the former path, and her leaving later that year was for unrelated personal reasons). Although arrogant and awkward in social situations (partly because he talks too much about research topics, usually in medical jargon), Dubenko is a dedicated and effective teacher and shows compassion towards his patients when he can. Angela Hicks Angela Hicks arrived in the Season One episode \\"Blizzard\\", and had to start working immediately because of a blizzard which led to many patients visiting the ER. She worked at County General between 1994 and 1997 and gave both Peter Benton and John Carter advice in many aspects. Dr. Hicks' absence was never explained, although she was virtually sidelined after John Carter left her team to transfer to Emergency Medicine and Peter Benton left to join Romano's team instead. Though she stopped appearing her locker could still be seen in the background for a few more years. Jack Kayson Jack Kayson is the chief of Cardiology and member of the hospital board. He usually appears in board discussions, and is sometimes called down to the ER for cardiology consults. He has at times, been shown doing procedures in the cardio cath lab. He is easily angered when residents in the ER question his medical decisions. In the first season, Kayson had a disagreement with Susan Lewis about the treatment a patient should receive who had a myocardial infarction. Susan tries to give the patient the correct treatment but he overrules her, the patient dies, and Kayson later hauls Susan in front of a hospital review board‚Äîonly to see the board largely side with her and chastise him for his behavior. Later Kayson is admitted with the classic signs of an acute myocardial infarction and Susan gives him the treatment he wants and eventually saves his life. After this, Kayson asks Susan to be his Valentine's date, but Susan declines. He later clashed with med student Michael Gallant over the death of a hypochondriac and tried but failed to stop Dr. Greg Pratt from helping treat desk clerk Frank after he suffered a massive heart attack. Dr. Kayson later returns twice in season 11, in which he is on the Hospital Board that investigates Dr. Elizabeth Corday. Then later returns to treat patient Jules \\"Ruby\\" Rubadoux with Dr. Anspaugh. Dr. Kayson is not seen again until season 14 in which he misdiagnoses a patient and argues with Dr. Gates. Abby Keaton Abby Keaton was a pediatric surgeon from Southside Hospital reassigned to County when Southside closed. She supervises a pediatric surgical rotation with Dr. Benton. Eventually, she begins a clandestine relationship with Dr. Carter, but their relationship ends when Keaton leaves for a volunteer mission to teach Pakistani surgeons. Gabriel Lawrence Gabriel Lawrence is Kerry Weaver's mentor. She hired him as the new Senior Attending Physician in the ER at County General. During his brief appearance, Dr. Lawrence shares his experiences with the members of the ER staff. It quickly becomes apparent that Lawrence is in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Mark Greene's well-founded suspicions are mistaken for jealousy, and Lucy Knight's notice of this is also dismissed by John Carter. At first Lawrence does not want to admit to what is happening, but the signs of his mental deterioration soon become readily apparent. These include sudden bursts of irritability, being unable to find the right word, leaving his reading glasses in the lounge freezer, and looking for his car on the wrong floor of the parking garage. After Greene stages a scene with a fake ER patient to point out these problems, Lawrence realizes he has no choice but to retire. He makes amends with his son in California, and goes to live with him. As he waits for his son to pick him up, he gets the chance to make one more diagnosis and save one last life‚Äîa patient with a rare case of strychnine poisoning that had baffled other ER physicians. At one point Lawrence mentions that he worked for the U.S. Army, a nod to Alda's role as Hawkeye Pierce in M*A*S*H. Alda received an Emmy nomination for his portrayal but lost it to James Whitmore (for his role on The Practice). Alda said that his great experience working with John Wells in the role of Lawrence led him to accept the role of Arnold Vinick on Seasons 6 and 7 of The West Wing. Amanda Lee Amanda Lee joined the staff of County General Hospital as the new Chief of Emergency Medicine, replacing Dr. Kerry Weaver, who had been interim chief in the wake of Dr. David Morgenstern's retirement following his heart attack. While she appeared normal on the outside, it became clear that Lee had serious emotional instabilities. In particular, she obsessed over Dr. Mark Greene, writing erotic stories featuring him, stealing his gloves and lab coat, and decorating her Christmas tree with twin heart-shaped ornaments bearing their faces. It also seemed that she confabulated quite extensively; several times, she mentioned a major incident in her life in response to someone confiding a similar incident to her. Dr. Greene became suspicious after he could not verify Lee's claim ‚Äì one of her confabulations ‚Äì that she had published an article in a Cornell University publication while still a third-year student. A copy obtained online attributed the article to \\"A.W. Lee\\" and pictured an Asian male in his 40s; Lee claimed he was a classmate that she was often confused with and that the following month's publication had corrected the error. When Greene attempted to check out the original journals from the hospital library to review additional articles written by Dr. A.W. Lee, he found that they had been checked out. In fact, Lee herself checked them out and removed the three articles with a razor. After intercepting a message from Cornell University for Mark ‚Äì he had been trying to verify whether or not Lee actually had graduated from there ‚Äì Lee snapped. She locked Mark in the CT scanner room when he was calming a patient suffering from agoraphobia after her CT scans. Lee accused Mark of being uncaring and hateful, then removed her lab coat and fled. By the time the CT technician returned from lunch, Lee was long gone. Upon contacting the authorities, the hospital learned that \\"Dr.\\" Lee had never graduated but had obtained a residency using the credentials of the same A. W. Lee whose journal articles she claimed to have written. It was also mentioned that she has had other names and professions such as lawyer and architect by pulling the same scams she did in order to be a doctor. Kim Legaspi Kim Legaspi first appears in season 7 and is introduced as a psychiatrist. Kim later gets involved in a friendship with Kerry Weaver that turns into more than a friendship after Kerry realizes she is a lesbian. Their relationship does not last long because Kerry is in the closet and uncomfortable at being in public with Kim. When Kim is falsely accused of sexual misconduct on a case, Dr. Romano leads a witch hunt and Kerry does not support Kim, leading Kim to break off their relationship. Kerry later tries to reconnect with Kim but Kim had moved on to a new partner. In the season 7 finale \\"Rampage\\", Dr. Romano fires Kim when she doesn't immediately answer a bogus page from him, and later cites more bogus reasons for terminating her to an aghast Kerry Weaver. Though Kerry comes out to Romano and says she'll fight him over his treatment of Kim, it's revealed in the Season 8 premiere that Kim quit at County and took a new position in San Francisco. Kevin Moretti Kevin Moretti was Chief of Emergency Medicine, sarcastically dubbed 'Mussolini' by Abby Lockhart for his Italian surname and stern manner of running the ER in order to maximize efficiency. Following the departure of Dr. Kerry Weaver and the resignation of Dr. Luka Kovaƒç, Dr. Kevin Moretti is moved from the intensive-care unit to take charge of the ER. His early appearances provoke much conflict with the ER Staff, particularly Abby and Pratt who find his \\"style\\" to be harsh and abrasive. Despite this, he proves to be intelligent and quite adept at attending/diagnosing patients, and (at least initially) his system seems to work. During a blackout-ridden Chicago night, he and Abby have an alcohol- fueled one night stand. After having a difficult visit from his troubled son, he finds out the son is having serious problems at college and takes personal leave to go help him. He intended his absence to be temporary, but it later proved to be permanent and Dr. Skye Wexler was appointed acting chief in his stead. Dr. Moretti later returns in the Season 14 Finale and apologizes separately to Abby and Luka for his role in their marital crisis. Abby is nonplussed by his explanation and doesn't talk very long to him, while Luka listens to Moretti's apology and then punches him in the jaw. Moretti remarks, \\"I guess I had that coming.\\" as Luka walks away. David Morgenstern David Morgenstern was the chief of surgery and head of the ER until 1998 when he resigns shortly after he has a heart attack. His background was a combination of Scottish and Russian-Jewish. Morgenstern first arrived at County in 1968 as a volunteer in his pre-med days. He was mentored by Dr. Oliver Kosten, a young ER physician whose visions of better patient care eventually translated into an expanded and more functional ER. David Morgenstern is responsible for a sage piece of advice that has been handed down throughout the series. In the pilot episode, when Julianna Margulies's character, nurse Carol Hathaway, is brought to the hospital with a drug overdose, Morgenstern tells Dr. Greene (Anthony Edwards) that he needs to \\"set the tone\\" to get the unit through the difficulty of treating one of its own. Dr. Morgenstern worked at County General Hospital until 1998 after he made a mistake during a surgery and tried to make Dr. Peter Benton the scapegoat. After Benton was suspended, Morgenstern admitted the truth to the hospital and told it to Benton in County's parking lot and resigned because the incident showed \\"I'm not a very great man, and that's what I need to work on.\\" Morgenstern returned to the ER in 2009 when his mentor, Dr. Kosten, wanders from his nursing home and returns to the ER he was instrumental in building. Morgenstern reveals to the current ER staff the dramatic impact his mentor had on himself as well as on the entire hospital. Skye Wexler Skye Wexler was a locum hired by Dr. Kevin Moretti to help alleviate the staff situation. Initially, Skye was only in Chicago for a few months earning some extra money to fund a surfing trip. But following Moretti's sudden departure, communication in the ER broke down and Skye spoke up that a new chief was needed right away. Much to her surprise, not to mention Pratt's, Anspaugh appointed Skye as the temporary head of the ER. Skye told Anspaugh that she did not want that job as she was not planning on staying in Chicago but Anspaugh pointed out that she was the most qualified member of staff and gave her an ultimatum: all or nothing. Following Skye's promotion, Pratt considered handing in his notice feeling undervalued but later changed his mind. Skye later got involved in a \\"friends with benefits\\" relationship with Dr. Lucien Dubenko. The relationship with Lucien ended due to his jealousy when Skye begins a friendship with ladies man Dr. Simon Brenner and also when she kept dismissing his efforts to become more involved in her non-sexual social life. =Secondary nurses= Haleh Adams Haleh Adams is a nurse in the ER of County General Hospital. She is one of only six characters to appear in every season. Her appearances were less frequent in the 1997‚Äì1998 and 1998‚Äì1999 seasons, as Freeman was appearing in the sitcom Working. Haleh is a confident and skilled nurse who at times displays a motherly disposition to the staff. When Ray Barnett protests angrily at Haleh being allowed to evaluate him to Susan Lewis, Lewis sharply tells him, \\"Haleh has been here longer than anyone- she knows what she's talking about.\\" Not one to be taken for granted or put upon, Haleh stands up for herself; often making her point with a sharp sardonic wit. She has been Nurse manager two times over her 35 years at County;Stated in episode 14 of season 1, that Haleh has been at County for at that time, 20 years. in 1997 when Carol Hathaway was home following her suspension from the ER and between 2000 and 2002, doing a terrible job in her first time there but a competent one the second time around. She has sung at both Christmas and Halloween parties in the ER and has a truly fantastic voice. Haleh has been fired for short periods twice: during one episode in season 9 (\\"Finders Keepers\\"), she was fired for a few hours by chief of the Emergency Room Robert Romano, but returned when Romano learned that nurses had many syndicates to protect them. In season 12, the new chief nurse Eve Peyton, Samantha Taggart fired her but she was later rehired when an airplane exploded over the city shortly after takeoff and County was seriously short on nurses. Sam called her in while Eve was away. Eve told Sam that it was a good move. Dawn Archer Dawn Archer appeared as an ER nurse beginning in season 13. Not much is known about her other than she is originally from New Orleans and was displaced in Hurricane Katrina. During her time on the job, she has developed friendships with fellow nurses Chuny Marquez and Haleh Adams, and to a lesser degree, Sam Taggart. Wendy Goldman Wendy Goldman was one of the regular nurses from the first three seasons of ER. Her character had a sweet and innocent demeanour, and frequently featured in comical subplots. Her first episode was in the pilot, \\"24 Hours\\", in 1994. Her absence from the show was explained by Kerry Weaver in season 4 when she says that two nurses left and Yosh Takata was hired to replace them. Goldman's name was never mentioned again after she stopped appearing. Lily Jarvik Lily Jarvik is one of only six characters to appear in every season of the show, having made her first appearance in episode 1.08 \\"9¬Ω Hours\\". Since then she has proved to be a valuable resource in the County General Emergency Department. She is generally seen in the trauma rooms and keeping the floor running during major incidents. Not much is really known about Lily as she was never been given much of a storyline to truly develop her character. Chuny M√°rquez Ethel \\"Chuny\\" M√°rquez is one of six characters who has been in all seasons of ER. She has often assisted in translating for Spanish-speaking patients. Chuny has had a relationship with Mark Greene in season 3 and with Luka Kovaƒç in season 9. After her relationship with Luka became problematic, she complained to Kerry Weaver who almost fired Luka. Later, when Chuny comments on how good Carter looks in a black suit, he reminds her about the \\"sexual harassment\\" complaints against Luka. She proved to be good friends with many of the nursing staff and attempted to set Samantha up with their self-defense trainer (who Sam had accidentally assaulted in the previous episode) It is revealed in season 14 that Chuny's real name is Ethel. Laura Cer√≥n has appeared in more episodes than any other recurring guest star, and is the only recurring guest star to have appeared in more than 200 episodes. Only main cast members Noah Wyle and Laura Innes appeared in more episodes. Chuck Martin Chuck Martin was a flight nurse and (later) ex-husband of Dr. Susan Lewis. They met during a trip to Las Vegas, in which they got drunk and later married. After they return to Chicago, they have the marriage annulled, but this did not stop Chuck and Susan from further dating. Chuck was injured in the helicopter crash on the roof of the hospital and had emergency surgery to remove his spleen. In this same crash, Dr. Romano was killed as the helicopter fell off the roof and landed on Dr. Romano on the ground. Susan later had a baby boy named Cosmo, whom Chuck looked after when Susan was promoted to Chief of Emergency Medicine after Dr. Romano's death. When Susan accepted a tenured position at the beginning of season 12, Chuck and his family move to Iowa. In Sherry Stringfield's return appearance in the series finale, however, Susan mentioned that she was dating again, suggesting that she and Chuck were no longer together. Malik McGrath Malik McGrath, along with nurses Haleh, Chuny and Lily, and paramedics Dwight Zadro and Doris Pickman, has appeared in every season since the pilot. He has given the ER some comic relief and appears to be good friends with desk clerks Frank Martin and Jerry Markovic, to whom Malik once played a joke on, during his birthday surprise party. It's also revealed that he gets very little pay despite his experience and for this does not protest his hours getting cut. He is an LPN- licensed practical nurse (also known as LVN- licensed vocational nurse in California and Texas) instead of an RN- registered nurse like most of the other ER nurses. In the episode where all the nurses strike Malik continues to work and states that he doesn't have to worry because it doesn't get much cheaper than an LPN, so he was safe. He was good friends with Abby Lockhart, having worked with her during her years as an ER nurse. Conni Oligario Conni Oligario was a nurse in the ER since the first season in 1994 until 2003 when she was fired during the reign of terror by ER chief Robert Romano in season 10. Conni and fellow nurses Lydia and Yosh protest their treatment and ask chief nurse Abby Lockhart to talk to Romano about it. When Abby is unable to address Romano, the three nurses are replaced and each given a 90-days suspension. Conni was never seen again in the ER after the suspension, although in Season 12's episode \\"Blame It On The Rain\\", Haleh mentions she's covering for Conni. Eve Peyton Eve Peyton, Ph.D., served briefly as chief nurse in the ER and worked closely with Dr. Victor Clemente. Her abrasive and unpleasant personality became especially clear when she forced Samantha Taggart to fire Haleh. Eventually, Eve herself was fired on Christmas Eve for punching a drunk patient who mocked some blind children and pouring urine on him. She has the skills of a doctor in medicine but does not hold a license to practice as one. An example of this is when she shows to have more knowledge of drugs, procedures, and emergency medical care than most residents and students. She has also been better at performing emergency procedures than most residents and medical students. She also enforces most physicians and senior nurses to teach inexperienced hospital doctors, students, and nurses, and is a staunch defender of nurses' rights. But she also had a hostile attitude towards most if not all of her working ER nurse staff; nearly all the doctors apart from Weaver instantly disliked her, and many of the nurses eventually began to turn against her. Sam Taggart was the only one who became friends with Eve, yet Eve made sure to label Sam \\"Judas\\" after her dismissal, leading Sam to simply watch Eve leave the ER forever in silent sadness. Shirley Shirley is a female surgery nurse usually seen either in the operating room or just outside, informing the surgeons about matters that are needed (for instance Romano or Corday receiving phone calls). She is also often seen at the surgical level front desk, informing people of whatever information she has received from the hospital's doctors. Being a surgery nurse she is rarely seen down in the ER or trauma rooms, but more in the OR, so she is usually seen working with doctors such as Elizabeth Corday or Peter Benton rather than doctors such as John Carter or Kerry Weaver and other staff nurses such as Chuny or Haleh. Yoshi Takata Yosh \\"Yoshi\\" Takata was the second male nurse introduced in ER, after Malik McGrath. Takata's character is Japanese, gay, and a convert to Judaism. He was hired in the episode the same day that Jeanie Boulet was to be fired by Kerry Weaver due to budgeting. Takata's hiring, however, cast doubt in Boulet's mind about whether budget issues had really caused her layoff. Along with fellow nurses Conni and Lydia, Yoshi is laid off in the tenth-season episode by character Dr. Romano during hospital staffing cuts and did not return to the show. Lydia Wright Lydia Wright-Grabarsky was the second character to be introduced in the pilot episode of the ER. She is seen waking up Mark Greene. She was a very experienced nurse and had developed some remarkable skills, including the ability to very accurately diagnose a patient's blood alcohol level simply from smelling their breath. She marries police officer Alfred Grabarsky in season 3. They get married in the Emergency departments waiting area. Lydia appears for the next-to-last time in 2003 when Dr Romano decides to cut senior nurses for cheaper labor. Lydia, along with Conni and Yosh were fired after protesting their reduced schedules. Lydia returned in the 2009 series finale. She is again working at County and wakes Archie Morris as she did Mark Greene in the pilot episode. She explains that she has been working nights so she can babysit her grandchildren. =Desk clerks and other non-medical staff= Miranda Fronczak Miranda Fronczak, better known to the staff as \\"Randi\\", is hired as a Desk Clerk in Episode 028 \\"Do One, Teach One, Kill One\\". The character is portrayed by Kristin Minter. A good looking assertive woman, Randi is not afraid to get her hands dirty or deal with hostile patients. In Episode 031 \\"Days Like This\\", she knocks out a violent patient with Dr. Weaver's crutch after he has knocked down both Weaver and Jeanie Boulet. In that same episode it is revealed that she is on probation when Randi casually refers to her parole officer. This comment leads to a great deal of speculation among the staff about what she went to prison for, including a betting pool. It is ultimately revealed by Randi that she went to jail for \\"malicious mischief, assault, battery, carrying a concealed weapon, and aggravated mayhem.\\" Randi is a bit of a rebel and is often seen wearing unprofessional attire more suitable to a club than an ER. Some of her clothes are designed and made by herself, and she attempts to market them under the label \\"Randi wear\\". When Weaver confronts her about her wardrobe, Randi replies that she is dressing more conservatively than normal; a revelation which leaves Weaver uncharacteristically speechless. She continues to get away with wearing whatever she wants throughout her many years of service in the ER. Later in season 5, Randi actually helps Weaver put together an outfit for her interview for the position of Chief of Emergency Medicine. During season 6 Randi punches an extremely obnoxious man who sets off the fire alarm (causing chaos in the ER) in order to get attention as he has a migraine. She is last seen in the Season 10 episode \\"Shifts Happen\\" dancing to hip hop music at the front desk with Dr. Pratt at 3:00 AM. In Season 14, Episode 3, Frank, trying to find someone to work the desk, complains, ‚ÄùNow even Randi's not available.‚Äù so, though she hasn't been seen, she is still apparently on staff. Cynthia Hooper Cynthia Hooper, portrayed by Mariska Hargitay, first appears in Episode 071 \\"Something New\\" as an applicant for the job of ER desk clerk. Her interview with Mark Greene and Carol Hathaway does not go well as she appears very emotional and somewhat unreliable and inexperienced given her work history. She has also forgotten her references. Cynthia waits until Mark has finished work and asks if she can talk about the job. In talking with her, Mark discovers that she is new to Chicago and feels sympathy for a lost soul in a new city. He invites her to get some coffee and, having made a personal connection with her, gives Cynthia the job without discussing it with Carol. Mark's decision to hire Cynthia is met with some hostility and her inexperience leads to some initial problems at the ER. Friction develops between Cynthia and some members of the ER staff, particularly Carol who did not want her to be hired in the first place and lashes out at Cynthia whenever she does anything wrong (which is fairly frequent). Meanwhile, Mark and Cynthia continue to develop a friendship and eventually end up in a relationship together. Their relationship, however, is somewhat dysfunctional as Mark is just having some fun after his recent emotional traumas and Cynthia is truly in love with Mark. When Mark's mother becomes seriously ill, Mark goes to California to be with his parents. Uninvited, Cynthia decides to surprise Mark by going out to California to support him and his family. She is surprised to find Mark annoyed by her arrival, which causes awkwardness between them. Mark ultimately admits to Cynthia that he is not in love with her, and upset, Cynthia returns to Chicago. On returning to Chicago, Mark finds that Cynthia has quit her job without leaving a forwarding address. Unhappy with how things ended, Mark uses his doctor status to find Cynthia's new address. He goes to her new apartment to apologize and return some of her possessions. He is surprised to see she has regained custody of her young son, and when he tries to make amends and resume their relationship, she is kind but firm in stating \\"You don't love me. I deserve better\\" and getting him to leave, politely but permanently. Jerry Markovic Jerry Anthony Markovic was desk clerk of the emergency room and later promoted to supervising emergency services coordinator (a position that carries no additional responsibilities and/or benefits, but requires him to wear a tie.) The character was portrayed by Abraham Benrubi. Jerry was comic relief on the series. The character was mostly seen playing jokes on other staff members, organizing parties and celebrations, trying to make money on the side via various get-rich-quick schemes and making humorous remarks. During the fourth season, Jerry accidentally blew up an ambulance with a grenade launcher; this led to a suspension from day turns by Kerry Weaver, thus Jerry was forced to attend at nights, but he would get his job back on days later that season. Because of his great height and girth, Jerry is also used as a bouncer if patients or customers become aggressive, although he claims he avoids violence and generally has a gentle nature. Jerry was last seen at the end of Season 5 and it was not until season 8 that he was called back to work after members of the staff became sick. When asked about where he's been for the past three years, he replied that he had been in \\"retirement.\\" Initially liberal Jerry and fellow desk clerk, arch-conservative Frank Martin, clashed, to the point that they were involved in a fight in which they crashed on Dr. Chen. Jerry and Frank received a warning from Dr. Weaver, and since then Jerry and Frank seemed to be getting along better. They evidently later became friends, as shown when Frank suffered a heart attack, a fact that really concerned Jerry. Equally, Frank was deeply affected when Jerry was shot in the 12th-season finale. Jerry's mother, played by Seinfeld's Estelle Harris, is introduced in the first episode of season 13 when her son was treated by some members of the staff after he was shot by Samantha Taggart's ex-boyfriend Steve Curtis, who went on a rampage in the emergency room in season 12's finale. During the assault, Jerry was shot while protecting a boy. Jerry's mother tells Archie Morris that she applied to Harvard four times for him, but he was never able to make it into college, and complains about Jerry's paycheck. Jerry ultimately survives the surgery, but was not seen again in the ER until Season 15. Jerry's mom had also appeared in a long shot in the Season 3 episode \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\\" berating Jerry for using her trashcans to trap a kangaroo on the loose. That episode was also one of the last episodes to show Jerry smoking a cigar. Up until the third season, Jerry was a cigar smoker (as was Benrubi himself, although it is not known if he still smokes). In Season 14, Episode 3, Frank, trying to find someone to work the desk, is heard to say, ‚ÄùDidn't 'cha hear, he moved to Alaska. He's slingin' pitchers of beer somewhere outside Anchorage.‚Äù This is a reference to Benrubi's character Ben Tomasson in the ABC television series Men in Trees. In the Season 15 episode \\"The High Holiday\\", Jerry returns to Chicago as he got tired of Alaska, and was first amicably welcomed back by Frank and Morris. Although he has not had any luck getting a job, he is presumably re-hired at County General, because Dr. Banfield needs someone to cover for Frank, who is under the influence of marijuana-laced brownies. He is seen back at his desk clerk job in several episodes after this. His final appearance is in the final episode, ‚ÄùAnd In the End . . .‚Äù Jerry is also a Universal Life Church Minister, and officiated Neela and Michael Gallant's wedding in the episode \\"I Do.\\" His politics seemed too progressive, often clashing with Frank's law and order conservatism. Jerry is single and there was no mention of him being married or having a girlfriend, although at the beginning of \\"The Gallant Hero and the Tragic Victor,\\" he turns down Dr Clemente's (John Leguizamo) offer of a beer because he's meeting a \\"lady friend.\\" However, in S15E16 'The Beginning of the End', Jerry, free of inhibition under the influence of a mushroom-derived toxin (from a love potion made by a mushroom expert, Teddy, who is a patient), makes a pass at a returning Dr John Carter ‚Äì telling \\"Dr. Carter, call me.\\" In the episode, \\"Blame It on the Rain,\\" it is revealed that Jerry is deathly afraid of thunderstorms‚Äîmainly because he has been hit by lightning on several previous occasions, a fact that everyone in the ER knows but Kerry Weaver, who sent him out in a storm to get a gift for her son Henry's birthday. He returns several hours later, dazed and holding a scorched paper bag. Frank asks him, \\"You got hit by lightning again, didn't you?\\" to which he only nods. At first Kerry does not believe him, but Jerry finally manages to get out the words, \\"Here's your change,\\" then hands her a bunch of coins that have been fused together. Needless to say, she's thoroughly convinced. In a 12th-season episode, it is revealed that Jerry is also fluent in American Sign Language, when he volunteers to interpret for a boy who was trying to bring a drugged girl to the ER and wound up being assaulted due to a misinterpretation by the police. Jerry's age has never been given on the show, although it is presumed that he is the same age as Benrubi himself (in his late 30s), although when he returned after three seasons, Jerry's hair and goatee are gray, so it is possible he could be older. Frank Martin Francis \\"Frank\\" Martin first appeared as a police officer who was shot in his foot in the first episode of the show. He was Dr. Carter's first patient and then as a desk clerk in the Season 6 episode \\"Such Sweet Sorrow,\\" temporarily replacing Jerry Markovic. Troy Evans, the actor who portrays Frank, had previously made a guest star appearance in the pilot episode \\"24 Hours\\" as a character named \\"Officer Martin.\\" When Frank arrives to start as desk clerk, he mentions to Weaver that he had previously worked as a Chicago policeman for 26 years. During his commentary on the ER season 1 DVD set, Michael Crichton confirmed that Frank and Officer Martin were the same character. Frank exhibited a more traditionalist, conservative, law and order type of philosophy that often put him at odds with some of his more liberal co-workers, especially in matters of sex outside marriage; when giving the expecting Abby Lockhart a gift basket, he remarked, 'That's for you and the little bastard\\". He ran background checks on patients in order to help the police round up criminals (which earned him the anger of Kerry Weaver), opposed giving medical care to illegal immigrants, and attempted to beat up a homeless man with a stick. He was almost as overtly racist and bigoted as Dr. Romano; his statements about women, minorities, gays, lesbians, and the indigent were often politically incorrect and deeply insensitive. However, unlike Romano, Frank was a generation out of step and eventually his attitude began to mellow; in later seasons, very few of his inappropriate comments had real malice attached to them. When asked for information by the staff (and sometimes patients, if their requests seem unreasonable) Frank typically gave a very sarcastic response, then (only sometimes) refers them to what they need. Despite his attitude, most of the doctors and nurses regarded him with a mixture of affection and exasperation- especially Neela Rasgotra and Luka Kovac, both of whom are non-American nationality and thus put up with Frank's insults often. Frank also tends to show a bit more patience and concern around children, and when a ten-year-old girl who had been kidnapped and raped for months died from gunshot wounds in the ER (Season 12) even Frank was too appalled to say anything witty. When Jerry came back to work, he and Frank fought over politics, eventually coming to blows and injuring Dr. Chen by accident. She prevented Weaver from suspending them by claiming that she tripped and hurt herself, then ordered Jerry and Frank to agree to learn to work together. The relationship between the two men became quite cordial, eventually developing into a genuine friendship; when Jerry was shot and nearly died in the Season 12 finale/start of Season 13, Frank was constantly at Jerry's side. In the Season 10 episode \\"Forgive and Forget,\\" Frank suffered a heart attack while at work. Ironically, his life was saved primarily by two minority staffers: English-Indian medical student Neela Rasgotra, who found him collapsed on the floor; and African American Dr. Greg Pratt, who successfully performed a life-saving procedure on Frank, using a syringe to remove blood that had accumulated around his heart. This episode also revealed that Frank was not only a former police officer, but also a Vietnam War veteran with high regard for his fellow soldiers, a loving husband, and a devoted father to a developmentally disabled daughter. All this offered a more complex illustration of his life and contradicted his workplace reputation as an elderly grouch. It was also more or less confirmed that Frank was indeed the same Officer Martin who shot himself in the foot in the show's debut. Following the heart attack, Frank remained predictably cantankerous, though in some ways the character seemed to become a nicer man‚Äîparticularly to Neela and Pratt. When Greg Pratt died in the Season 15 premiere \\"Life After Death,\\" Frank was deeply shaken and upset. Upon Neela's departure from County in the Season 15 episode \\"Shifting Equilibrium,\\" Frank threw her an elaborate farewell party that focused on Neela's Indian heritage. Despite his personality, he does show a deep liking to other doctors, such as Archie Morris and John Carter. He spoke in defense of Morris to Banfield, explaining Pratt's death affected him harder than most. He welcomed Carter back when he returned with a pregnant Kem, and wished him good luck in him getting his kidney transplant. Timmy Rawlins Timmy was one of the many special County General ER staff members that was in the show's 2-hour pilot episode. Halfway into the show's first season he disappeared without any explanation. Years later in season 13 he was brought back into the show and resumed his position as a desk clerk on the staff of County General's ER. It was explained in his return to the show in season 13 as to why he left County he said it was because he had felt trapped in Chicago and needed to do something new, so he left to travel the world. Later in the season he went on a cruise with Charge Nurse Samantha Taggart's grandmother Gracie and even though the cruise was only supposed to last 1 week they ended up gone for 2 months which he explained was because they went to Singapore and they also later got stuck at the Cambodian border. He disappears once again without any explanation after the season ends.

Its website was launched in November 2011 in the UK and Germany with two staff doctors. \\\\- In 2012, the company raised an angel round of $1.4 million. In April 2012, DrEd opened in Austria and launched an emergency contraception delivery service in the UK. \\\\- On 20 June 2012, DrEd was launched in Switzerland. In early 2014, the business became profitable. In December 2014, DrEd was launched in Ireland, offering prescriptions for various medications. In June 2016, the service was launched in France under the new brand Zava with four French doctors providing online consultations. In September 2018, Zava had 155 employees and served patients in six European countries. It was one of the largest digital healthcare companies in Europe having served more than 2 million patients online, including 400,000 from Germany. In 2018 and 2019, British and German media wrote about Zava's stockpiling of key medications, in the context of a potential shortage of Viagra Connect caused by Brexit. In January 2019, DrEd changed its name to Zava in Germany. According to the website, the name is derived from the French √áa va? (\\"How are you?\\"). The firm also announced plans to open an office in Germany. In June 2019, Health Bridge Ltd., which owns Zava, raised $32m (¬£20m) in a series A round. It aimed to expand its service in Europe and open an office in Hamburg.  Regulation  Zava operates under British and European Union laws. In the UK, Health Bridge Ltd., the company that owns zavamed.com, is registered with and regulated by the Care Quality Commission. Health Bridge Limited has a MHRA permission to sell medicines online. Health Bridge Ltd. Pharmacy is registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council. In Europe, the company operates under the European Directive 2011/24/EC on cross-border healthcare that states that prescriptions written by a doctor registered in one EU member state are recognized in all other member states. However, the legal grounds for Zava‚Äôs services have been questioned in several EU countries. Doctors and pharmacists have highlighted challenges between local doctor treatment and prescription fulfilment from pharmacies due to the European Directive (see \\"Criticism and controversies\\"). \\\\- Service In the EU, Zava offers diagnosis by a doctor using telemedicine and is offering Rx prescriptions, which can be delivered using partner online pharmacies. Iin the UK, Zava has its own in-house registered pharmacy. Zava relies on patients filling in a detailed online medical questionnaire which is reviewed by a person from its in-house clinical team. The doctors provide medical consultation and can prescribe medicine. Zava has provided 3 million paid consultations since its launch. Criticism and controversies = In Austria = In April 2012, when DrEd was launched in Austria it faced opposition from the Minister of Health Alois St√∂ger, the Austrian chamber of physicians and the Austrian chamber of pharmacists. \\\\- \\\\- The Austrian association for patient‚Äôs rights also expressed its concerns about the quality of service that DrEd may provide. In January 2013, the Austrian consumer magazine Konsument tested DrEd.com by ordering a gonorrhea treatment and a prescription for a malaria drug. The editors noted that the online doctor \\"comically\\" advised a sex worker of the need to inform her sexual partners of the last three months about her STD infection (which the Austrian law requires). In malaria cases, the editors complained that the online doctor gave them an \\"unnecessary\\" preventive treatment, because their test patient was supposed to travel only above 2,500 meters altitude, where the disease was not present. The magazine concluded that Austrian patients should absolutely avoid DrEd or any online medicine service, because they \\"cannot replace the personal meeting between the doctor and the patient\\". In 2016, Profil, an Austrian weekly news magazine, tested the DrEd.com service by ordering Viagra and once against expressed concerns around the quality of online consultation and prescription. =In Germany= In 2011, when the service was launched in Germany, Dirk Heinrich, the chairman of NAV-Virchow- Bund, an association of German physicians, criticized DrEd for prescribing medicines without physical examination. He said that \\"a diagnosis from an online survey is not a diagnosis, but a guess\\" and called DrEd \\"a covert online-pharmacy\\". \\\\- In July 2012, Stiftung Warentest, a German consumer organisation, tested DrEd with patients allegedly having bladder infection and chlamydia infection. In both cases antibiotics were prescribed without the urine tests necessary for the diagnosis. \\\\- DrEd responded with an open letter, questioning the care of the anonymous testers. In March 2013, the Federal Ministry of Health questioned the legal grounds on which DrEd was operating in Germany. In October 2013, when DrEd reached an agreement with the pharmacy chain Ordermed for the morning-after pill delivery, it was canceled by Ordermed because of its pharmacy partners' objection. \\\\- In fall 2013, the newly-elected Federal government proposed changes to the law, demanding a direct doctor-patient consultation for the initial prescription of medicines, which was sharply criticized by DrEd. In May 2014, the Bavarian Health Minister, Melanie Huml, demanded the Federal government to clarify that online prescriptions made outside of Germany were not valid. In 2016, the Ministry of Health proposed changes to German legislation demanding personal contact between doctor and patient and a ban on online issued prescriptions, which became popularly known as \\"Lex DrEd\\" or \\"DrEd-Verbot\\" (DrEd ban). On 11 November 2016, the Bundestag approved these changes. This ban forced DrEd to work with EU pharmacies outside of the country that offered German delivery. However, in April 2018, the Chamber of Physicians of Schleswig-Holstein changed its code to allow online consultations to the state doctors and, in early May 201,8 the change happened on a national level, affirmed by the Federal Congress of German doctors. \\\\- Also in May 2018, the Chamber of Physicians of Baden-W√ºrttemberg approved DrEd as a model project, following its 2016 decision to test telemedicine services within approved model projects where web service is compared to the hospital treatment and evaluated by the Chamber. = In the UK and Ireland = In 2012, when DrEd launched the morning after pill delivery service in the UK, it was criticized for encouraging underage sex and a lack of care. In 2015, when DrEd began offering STI testing kits online, some doctors criticized the practice, claiming that ordering STI test kits online does not allow patients to receive advice on safe sexual practices the way face-to-face consultations do.

This region has the largest proportion of scheduled tribes in the country. Northeast India comprises the former British province of Assam and part or all of the former princely states of Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim. There are areas of plains in the modern State of Assam, but otherwise the region is mostly hilly or mountainous. The hills have long been populated with Tibeto-Burman and Sino- Tibetan hill people, some of whom originate in other parts of the Himalayas or of Southeast Asia. There are many distinct groups with unique languages, dress, cuisine and culture. The British made little effort to integrate the hill people into British India, but governed through a system of village chiefs and headmen. They gave these leaders greater authority than they had traditionally enjoyed. In some areas Protestant missionaries converted the people to Christianity and educated an elite. This elite pushed for greater autonomy for the hill people within the state of Assam, and obtained some autonomy at a district level after Indian independence in 1947. In response to attempts by the Assamese majority in the plains to impose their language, the hill people began to struggle for yet more autonomy as separate states within the Indian Union, which they largely achieved. Today, the hill people have political control in most of the new hill states surrounding Assam, although plains people control parts of the economy. There are continued tensions between the hill people and plains people, and also tensions between different hill peoples in each hill state. Violent insurgent groups continue to cause many fatalities. Location The North Eastern Region is bounded to the north by Nepal, China and Bhutan, to the east by Myanmar and to the southwest by Bangladesh. It is connected to India to the west by a narrow corridor. Apart from the fertile central plains of Assam bordering the Brahmaputra River and the Barak River, the region is hilly or mountainous, including parts of the Himalayas, the Garo Hills, Khasi and Jaintia Hills, Mikir Hills and North Cachar Hills to the south of the Brahmaputra, the Mishmi Hills in the far east, and the Patkai Range, Naga Hills, Manipur Hills, Lakher Hills and Lushai Hills along the border with Myanmar to the east and southeast. At the time of Indian Independence from British Rule in 1947, the Northeastern region consisted of Assam and the princely states of Manipur and Tripura. Manipur and Tripura became Union Territories of India in 1956, and states in 1972. Sikkim was integrated as the eighth North Eastern Council state in 2002. People Ahom kingdom c. 1826, roughly corresponding to the northern Brahmaputra valley in modern Assam. Many of the ethnic groups of the hills of Northeast India have origins in Southeast Asia: Myanmar, China and Thailand. Before the British arrived the hill tribes traded with the plains people of the Ahom kingdom in the Brahmaputra River Valley, but periodically fought with them. The Ahoms, who preceded the British as rulers of the Brahmaputra Valley, never held the surrounding hills, and the rulers of pre-colonial Cachar never held the hills that surround the Barak Valley. Writing about the broader area of mountainous parts of Southeast Asia that he calls \\"Zomia\\", Professor James C. Scott argues in The Art of Not Being Governed (2009) that while valley people see hill people as backward, \\"our living ancestors\\", they may be better understood as \\"runaway, fugitive, maroon communities who have, over the course of two millennia, been fleeing the oppressions of state-making projects in the valleys\\". Scott describes the hill people as \\"self-governing\\" in contrast with the \\"state-governed\\" people of the valleys. This anarchist culture is rapidly disappearing as the hill people, their land and resources are integrated into the nation states. The hill people often practice shifting cultivation. Scott states that this is to evade taxation, but a simpler explanation is that it is a good approach to farming in thinly populated highlands. According to the 2001 Census of India there were over 38 million people in Northeast India, with over 160 Scheduled Tribes as listed in the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, as well as a diverse population of non-tribal people. The Sixth Schedule gives a simplified view, since there are at least 475 ethnic groups speaking almost 400 languages or dialects. The boundaries between hill tribes are not rigid, since there are clans that are common to several tribes, and conversion from one tribe to another is possible. History =Colonial era= Assam in 1951, with colonial-era boundaries Assam subdivisions in 1950 The British divided the hill areas into two groups. In the Excluded Areas, where tax collection was very difficult and the tribal people were considered hostile, trade by the plains people was not allowed. These were the North-East Frontier Tracts, Naga Hills, Lushai Hills, and North Cachar Hills. Trade was allowed subject to some restrictions in the less rugged Partially Excluded Areas to the south and west of Assam. These included the Garo, Mikir, Khasi and Jaintia Hills. The British acknowledged that the colonial boundaries were artificial. C.S. Elliot, chief commissioner of Assam, wrote in 1881, \\"the more I thought about it ... the less practicable it seems to try to restrain the Nagas with their wanderings and trading habits, within an imaginary line which they have always been accustomed to cross.\\" The British administrator J.P. Mills wrote in 1926 of the boundary between Assam and Burma that \\" It is one of the most curious frontiers in the world, and a great natural boundary. On the west lies the valley of Assam, and on the east the valleys of Chindwin and Irrawady. Yet, though it lies between two fertile, populous provinces, with their railways, roads, and steamers services, it is as yet largely unexplored and contains some of the most primitive tribes to be found within our Indian Empire.\\" Robert Niel Reid, a British governor of Assam, said of the hill tribes, \\"They are not Indians in any sense of the word, neither in origin, nor in language, nor in appearance, nor in habits, nor in outlook and it is by historical accident that they have been tacked to an Indian Province\\". Furer- Haimendorf (1945) saw the occasional uprisings of the frontier tribes against the British as \\"more in the nature of resistance to the establishment of Government's authority than a challenge to the administration.\\" The segregation enforced by the British made the hill tribes view the plains people as exploiters, and to identify with their fellow hills people, while the plains people saw the hill tribes as backward people who were retarding development in the plains. The separation of Burma in 1937 and partition of British India in 1947 divided many tribal groups such as the Garo, Khasi, Kom- rem, Mara, Kuki, Zomi, Mizo and Naga across international borders. State and district boundaries create multi-ethnic political entities, while further dividing tribal groups. The British enhanced the power of village chiefs by giving them responsibility for administration, policing and justice. Where there was no chief, the British created a \\"headman\\". The chiefs and headmen were subordinate to the District Officer, the arbitrator and supreme authority in any dispute. The British let the Christian Church, mostly Protestant, undertake most welfare works. Missionaries introduced Bibles translated into the local languages and printed in the Latin script as compared to the Bengali script of the plains. They had less success with the Khasi and Jaintia people, who had closer trading and cultural connections with the plains people. The missionaries were also unable to penetrate into what is now Arunachal Pradesh, where the people retained their Buddhist or indigenous beliefs. The Church helped create an educated elite with a modern outlook who challenged the authority of the chiefs and the district administration. By 1930 this elite was starting to call for constitutional reform. =Separatist movements= Autonomous divisions of Northeast India When the political structure of independent India was being discussed, the British were inclined to keep the tribal people of the Excluded and Partially Excluded areas separate from the plainspeople, but Indians such as Rohini Kumar Chaudhuri wanted them to be part of a unified state of Assam so they could be assimilated into the plains culture. The leaders of the hill people disagreed, and wanted to retain separation from the non-tribal people. The Khasi leader J.J.M. Nichols-Roy was the most prominent member of the educated elite, pushing for autonomy of the hill districts of Assam at time of independence. His Khasi National Conference communicated with similar organizations such as the Garo National Conference, Mizo Union and Naga National Council. In response, the constitutional plan defined District Councils to look after tribal affairs in the hill districts, to which the chiefs would be subordinate. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India provides for tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram to be administered as autonomous districts or regions. The Fifth Schedule applies to scheduled areas in other parts of India. Neither schedule applies to the hill areas of Manipur, where all the people are tribal, or to the tribes of the Assam plains. The Hill State movement developed in the Gari and Khasi hills. The movement emerged at a meeting in Shillong on 16‚Äì17 June 1954 called by Captain Wiliamson Sangma of the Garo Hills District Council to discuss creation of a separate hill state and amendments to the Sixth Schedule. All the participants were against the attempt to impose Assamese as the state language. The representatives from the United Mikir and North Cachar Hills and the Lushai Hills wanted to remain within Assam but with greater autonomy, while those from the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo communities wanted a separate state or states. The Naga National Council became dominated by separatists. The Naga leader Angami Zapu Phizo did not participate in the Hill State movement since he was pursuing independence for Nagaland alone. The Khasi leader Rev. B. M. Pugh (1897‚Äì1986) wrote in his 1976 autobiography: \\"So we agitated for the separation from Assam, for a separate State for the hill people .... We felt that the [State Reorganization] Commission did not want to create a State for the hill areas only, as they feared that it would be unlike all other States in India‚Äîthat it would be a Christian State.\\" Pugh went on to argue that a single large hill state comprising what is now Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal, Mizoram and the districts of Mikir and North Cachar Hills would have been much more viable than the mini-states that were in fact created, the separatist movements would not have developed and the tribal people would have become psychologically and culturally integrated with the rest of India sooner. Pugh was a moderate. More radical Khasis such as Wickliffe Syiem could not accept loss of independence for the Khasi states, and after trying to get support for the separatist cause at the United Nation went into exile in Bangladesh. Northeast India Assamese became the official language of Assam State in 1960, stimulating non-Assamese to seek separate states. In 1972 Assamese became the medium of education throughout Assam State, leading to demands by the people off Khasi-Jaintia snd Garo Hills for formation of Meghalaya State. There were violent riots in 1960 and 1972 by hill tribes opposed to assimilation by the Assamese, who demanded separation from Assam as separate states within the Union of India. Nagaland became an independent state from part of Assam in 1963. Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura became states in 1972. Arunachal Pradesh gained statehood in 1975 and Mizoram in 1987. =Post-separation conflicts= There continued to be sometimes violent struggles in the new hill states between non-tribal and tribal communities. Various attempts were made to resolve the often-violent struggles between the state and the hill tribes through accords, with varying degrees of success. Almost all the ethnic groups are dispersed over different locations rather than living in one concentrated area, so a territorial area can only be achieved by redrawing boundaries and disenfranchising some of the residents. Most peace accords guarantee cultural rights and include provisions for the rebels to disarm and receive assistance in returning to civilian life. Often the surrender and disarmament have been incomplete, while the guarantees of cultural rights have not been fully implemented, or may have harmed other groups. The accords generally establish a system of representation on a territorial or ethnic basis. Often the accords have tended to decrease or destroy the authority of the signatory organization, which would then be replaced by more militant groups that were not part of the accord. This pattern has been seen in Nagaland, Manipur (Nagas), Assam (Bodo plains tribe) and Tripura. As of 2005 the tribal people were politically dominant over the plains people in the hill states, but the plains people controlled large parts of the economy, notably secondary and tertiary economic occupations. Pointing to the Bengali dominance in Tripura as an example, the tribal leaders of the other hill states demand restrictions on activities of non-tribal people as allowed under the Sixth Schedule. There are also tensions between the different tribal groups within each state, where the more developed tribes view the less developed as a handicap, and both see further separation as a solution. An example is the movement to create a separate \\"Garoland\\" from Meghalaya. In 1995‚Äì2005 there were violent clashes between Nagas and Kukis, between Kukis and Tamils in Moreh, and between Pangals and Meteis. The Hmar continued to agitate to join Mizoram during this period. However, little was done to address the problems and no peace accords were signed. March 2015 protest over Behali killings by the All Assam Gorkha Students Union The state police and special forces have been involved in fighting insurgents, but the national forces have been the main players. Between 1992 and 2001 there were about 12,181 fatalities in the insurgencies and terrorist conflicts in the Northeast of India, including the plains and hill areas. Assam suffered the most with 4,443 deaths, followed by Manipur (3,006), Tripura (2,633), Nagaland (1,802), Meghalaya (140), Arunchal Pradesh (134) and Mizoram (23). The rebel groups are said to have received arms through the trade in illegal drugs and through theft from the armed forces. The government has accused Bangladesh and Bhutan of supplying arms, and China and southern Thailand may also be sources. The objectives of the many insurgent groups are obscure, but some seem to be mainly criminal. It seems unlikely that the Indian Union will accept the formation of any new states in the Northeast region, but they may agree to formation of further autonomous development councils. An example is the Tiwa (Lalung) in Assam, an ethnic group has been allowed representation by an autonomous council but did not get a territorial council which would administer an area defined as belonging to the group. An autonomous council could try to establish a contiguous territory that could be recognized under the Sixth Schedule. An underlying issue is that the tribal people want development, but fear that this will lead to assimilation by the non-tribal people and loss of identity. Decline of shifting cultivation Shifting cultivation, known as adiabik in Arunachal Pradesh and jhoom in Assam and Tripura, is an ancient method of farming in the tropics and subtropics. It is a sustainable way to use forest resources in areas with low human populations. However studies in the Philippines, Africa and India have shown that jhooming can only support about 6 people per . Of the 19 tribal communities in Tripura, all but the Bhutias and Chaimals practice shifting cultivation, and almost 40% are entirely reliant on this form of farming. As elsewhere, jhooming involves clearing an area of forest land on a hillside, farming it for a year or so, then letting it regenerate for several years. In 1987 the Jhumia population in Tripura totalled 288,390. In traditional jhooming, an area with dense bamboo growth or fairly dense secondary growth is chosen and cultivation plots laid out. Tracts of virgin climax forest are preserved as sacred groves around the area. The land is cleared apart from a few large trees, which are thinned, and the cut vegetation is spread out to dry, protecting the soil during this period. It is then burned just before the rains start, and the ash is washed into the soil to provide fertilizer for crops such as cereals, pulses, oil seeds, vegetables and fiber crops. The crop is guarded and weeded as it grows, then harvested in a communal effort. The land is then left fallow for 20 to 25 years. Various measures ensure rapid forest regeneration and recovery of soil fertility. The traditional jhoomers also gather wild forest products, hunt, fish and make tools and handicrafts. Their culture stresses conservation of the forest on which they depend. Between 1901 and 1991 there was explosive growth in the population of Tripura, particularly after 1941, mainly caused by Bengali Hindu migrants fleeing violence. The newcomers grabbed land from the traditional farmers, pushing them further into the interior, with little effort to control the situation until 1958. Migration resumed in 1963 due to riots in Eastern Pakistan, and in 1971 during the Bangladesh liberation war. The migrants, accustomed to a combination of employment supplemented by settled farming, began to practice jhooming for supplementary income, and by 2000 accounted for over 80% of jhooming in Tripura. They used a short fallow cycle of 3‚Äì5 years, and failed to follow many of the essential conservation practices of traditional jhooming. At the same time, the State Administration created Reserved Forests and Wildlife Protected Areas, and assigned large tracts of primary evergreen forests to forestry and other uses, greatly reducing the land available for jhooming and forcing much shorter fallow cycles. Between 1972 and 1985 the jhoomed area in Tripura fell from . By 1981 almost all the jhumia households were dependent on employment for income. The community social structure had broken down, and the younger people had become involved in commercial, sometime illegal, exploitation of forest resources. This has put huge pressure on the forest ecology. Some efforts have been made to resettle jhumias on the plains, or to help them adapt to working on coffee, black pepper, rubber, betel, kathal and orange plantations. States The hill states are each home to several tribes, although sources disagree about the numbers, and some tribes live in more than one state or country. As of 2005 the percentages of the population that belonged to Scheduled Tribes in the seven eastern states was: * Mizoram: 94.75% * Nagaland: 87.70% * Meghalaya: 85.53% * Arunachal Pradesh: 63.66% * Manipur: 34.41% * Tripura: 30.94% * Assam: 12.69% =Mizoram= Chhimtuipui (top) and Tuipui river of Mizoram Mizoram was a district of Assam under the British. It lies between Bangladesh to the west and Myanmar to the south and east. It borders Tripura to the northwest, Assam to the north and Manipur to the northeast. It is a mountainous region with hills that run from north to south, highest in the east. The average height of the hills is around , with the highest peak being Phawngpui (Blue Mountain) at . About 95% of the population is of diverse tribal origins who settled in the state, mostly from Southeast Asia, in waves of migration starting about the 16th century but mainly in the 18th century. This is the highest concentration of tribal people among all states of India. The Mizo people are protected as a Scheduled Tribe. The term Mizo is used to define an overall ethnicity, and covers various related peoples who claim descent from Sinlung, a mythical rock north of the Shan State of Myanmar. The include the Khiangte, Renthlei, Lawitlang, Zote, Thiek, Ralte, Khowbung, Lusei etc. The Mizo Union held back from the hill state movement , then joined the Mizo National Front supported by former chiefs in demanding a separate Mizo state. During the famine of 1958‚Äì59 the Indian state failed to provide aid to the hill people, and this neglect led to the Mizo armed uprising. Mizoram was detached from Assam as a Union territory in 1972. The 1986 Mizo Accord, reached after careful consultation as part of a peace process, was relatively successful. The Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of India and the Mizo National Front resulted in creation of the State of Mizoram. Mizoram became the 23rd state of India in February 1987. The Mizo movement had at first been based on creating a state based on a shared geographical location, rather than a state for the majority Lushai ethnic group. However the many non-Lushai groups were overlooked in the Mizo Accord, and the Brus and Hmars began to demand autonomous district or regional councils. Later the Mizoram state government and the Hmar People's convention came to an agreement after nine rounds of talks. The 1994 Memorandum of Settlement between the Mizoram State Government and the Hmar People's Convention led to formation of the Sinlung Hills Development Council (changed to Sinlung Hills Council in 2018). It took thirteen rounds of talks for the Mizoram government to strike an agreement with the Bru National Liberation Front. =Nagaland= Nagas of Nagaland rehearsing their traditional dance during the Hornbill Festival Nagaland lies between Myanmar to the east and Assam to the west. It adjoins Arunchal Pradesh to the north and Manipur to the south. Nagaland is mostly mountainous except for the areas bordering Assam, which make up 9% of the area of the state. Mount Saramati is the highest peak at . Its range forms a natural barrier between Nagaland and Myanmar. As of 2011 the state population was 1,978,000. Nagaland is one of three states in India where the population is mostly Christian, the others being Meghalaya and Mizoram. The people of Nagaland, collectively called Naga, are in fact a number of very different tribes with mutually incomprehensible languages. Nagaland is home to 16 tribes: Angami Naga, Ao Naga, Chakhesang Naga, Chang Naga, Khiamniungan, Konyak, Lotha Naga, Phom, Pochury, Rengma Naga, Sangtam Naga, Sumi Naga, Yimchunger, Zeme-Liangmai (Zeliang), Dimasa Kachari and Kuki. There are also members of the Rongmei Naga. Each tribe has distinct customs, language and dress. The Naga National Council (NNC) was formed in February 1946 to work for autonomy for Nagaland. The Naga were given the opportunity to remain separate from India as a crown colony, but let this pass. After 1947 they continued to seek autonomy. In 1957 the Tuensang Frontier Division of the North East Frontier Agency was merged with the Naga Hills District to form the Naga Hills Tuensang Area, which became the state of Nagaland in 1963. The Naga People's Convention met for three years to formulate the demands that led to the Sixteen-Point Agreement of 1960. This agreement with the Government of India led to formation of the State of Nagaland. The Sixteen-Point Agreement left out the Naga National Council, which was an underground organization at the time. After long negotiations Nagaland became a state in December 1963. The Burma-India Boundary Agreement of 1967 finalized the boundary between the two countries, cutting from north to south through Naga country. The Naga National Council signed the Shillong Accord of 1975. The NNC was discredited after signing the accord. The more militant National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) broke away from the NNC in 1987. The National Socialist Council of Nagaland emerged as the most powerful force in the state. In 1988 this group in turn split into the NSCN (Isaac-Muivah) and the NSCN (Khaplang). As of 2011 these two groups had accepted a ceasefire and were in negotiations with the Indian government. Nagaland is thought to have significant oil resources. The Nagas want reassurance that oil extraction will not damage the environment, and that if they are forced to relocate they will receive land as well as money in compensation. = Meghalaya= Tiwa tribal woman of Meghalaya Meghalaya was previously part of Assam, but on 21 January 1972 the districts of Garo, Khasi and Jaintia hills became the new state of Meghalaya. Meghalaya, uniting the Khasi-Jainta and Garo districts, was the only state formed of more than one district, and as early as 1975 tensions were emerging between the Khasis and Garos. Meghalaya is bounded to the south and west by Bangladesh and to the north and east by Assam. The state is the wettest region of India, with an average of of rain a year. Due to its rugged terrain, the British imperial authorities called the region the \\"Scotland of the East\\". The state is covered by the Meghalaya subtropical forests ecoregion Its mountain forests are distinct from the lowland tropical forests to the north and south. As of 2001 about 70% of the state was forested. As of 2005 about 85.53% of the population of Meghalaya were members of scheduled tribes. English is the official language. The other principal languages spoken include Khasi, Garo, Pnar, Biate, Hajong, Assamese and Bengali. Unlike many Indian states, Meghalaya has historically followed a matrilineal system where the lineage and inheritance are traced through women; the youngest daughter inherits all wealth and she also takes care of her parents. The economy is mostly agrarian, with a significant commercial forestry industry. The important crops are potatoes, rice, maize, pineapples, bananas, papayas, spices, etc. The state is geologically rich in minerals, but it has no significant industries. =Arunachal Pradesh= Apatani tribal Woman going to field in Lower Subansiri, Arunachal Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh, formerly the North-East Frontier Agency, is in the extreme northeast of India. It borders Assam and Nagaland to the south, Bhutan in the west, Myanmar in the east and is separated from China in the north by the McMahon Line. This line was agreed in 1914 between the Tibetan government and the British colonial government, but was not accepted by the Chinese. During the Sino-Indian War of 1962 the Chinese occupied most of Arunachal Pradesh, but in November 1962 withdrew to positions behind the McMahon line. The North East Frontier Agency became the union territory of Arunachal Pradesh on 20 January 1972. Arunchal Pradesh was formed from the frontier tracts as an administrative convenience, with much less political activity by the people than elsewhere in the northeast. Arunachal Pradesh became a state on 20 February 1987. Arunchal Pradesh covers a part of the Himalayas, with its highest elevation being . The terrain is cut by river valleys, including those of the Kameng, Subansiri, Siang (Brahmaputra), Dibang, Lohit and Dihing rivers. The climate varies from humid subtropical in the lower areas to alpine at the highest elevations. The economy is mostly based on agriculture, with the tribal groups practicing shifting cultivation. Forest products are also important. There is a large hydroelectric potential. As of 2005 about 63.66% of the population were members of scheduled tribes. The remainder are mostly immigrants from Bengal or the Hindi Belt. The state is home to various Tibeto-Burman speaking Tribes. Monpa people live near the border with Bhutan to the west, Tani people and Mishmi people in the center, Jingpo, Naga and Lisu people in the area bordering Myanmar to the east and Naga people in the area bordering Nagaland in the south. There are transition zones on the borders where the Bugun, Hruso, Miji and Sherdukpen people form cultural \\"buffers\\" between the Tibetic Buddhist tribes and the Tani hill tribes. In addition, there are isolated peoples scattered throughout the state. = Manipur= Chinglen Nongdrenkhomba (1788‚Äì1834), ruler of Manipur Manipur is bounded by Myanmar to the southeast and east, Nagaland to the north, Assam to the west and Mizoram to the south. About 90% of the area is mountainous, surrounding the central valley sloping to the south. Forests, mostly open, cover 77.4% of the state. Around 70% of the population of Manipur depend on agriculture. Handloom weaving is an important cottage industry. The history of the Kingdom of Manipur dates back to 33 A.D. The British designated Manipur a \\"subordinate native state\\" in 1891, and in 1907 stated that the hill people were dependent on the Maharajah of Manipur. Manipur was the scene of the Kuki Rebellion 1917‚Äì1919 in which the Kukis in the hills conducted a tenacious guerrilla war against the British, and only yielded when the British threatened to completely destroy their settlements. In 1947 Manipur adopted a constitution that provided for universal adult suffrage and placed limitations on the king's power. Also in 1947 the king signed an Instrument of Accession with India, to take effect in 1949 possibly exceeding his authority under the constitution. Hijam Irabot Singh (1896‚Äì1951) opposed the merger of Manipur with India and proposed creation of a Purbanchal republic that would comprise Manipur, Tripura, Cachar and the Mizo hills. It would also include the Kabaw Valley, which had been ceded to Myanmar. On 15 October 1949 Manipur became part of the Indian Union as a part \\"C\\" State. It became a Union Territory in 1956. In 1972 Manipur became a full state. Manipur was not included in the Eighth Schedule until 1992. The Manipuri people did not see the union with India as providing any benefits. As of 2005 about 34.41% of the population were members of scheduled tribes. The hill tribes of Manipur included Naga tribes in the areas next to Nagaland, and Kuki and Mizo tribes in areas next to Mizoram. The umbrella terms \\"Naga\\" and \\"Kuki\\" in the first list of schedule tribes were not accepted by the tribes, who insisted on a change to the list in 1965 under which they were designated by their names. Only the Thadou tribe retained the Kuki name. The Meiteis are the majority ethnic group in Manipur, but occupied only a tenth of the land and were not allowed to buy land in the hill areas. By contrast, the hill tribes could buy land, and as scheduled tribes had better opportunities for employment in the public sector. Meiteis responded by reviving their traditional culture and religion, protesting the presence and special powers of armed forces in the area, and forming militant separatist groups with links to other such groups in Myanmar and Northeast India. These included the United National Liberation Front, Peoples Liberation Army and Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak, and fought an urban or semi-urban guerrilla war in the Imphal valley. Faced with simultaneous uprisings in the plains and by the Kukis of the hill regions, in 2008 the Indian Army signed a Suspension of Operation agreement with eight Kuki groups in the hope that they could be used against the rebel groups in the valley. Active groups in Manipur in 2009 included the People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak, the Military Council faction of the Kangleipak Communist Party, the People's United Liberation Front, the People's Liberation Army and the Kuki Revolutionary Army. The areas bordering Nagaland were affected by the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM). =Tripura= The princely state of Tripura included the hills of the present state of Tripura and the plains of Chakla Roshanabad, now part of Bangladesh. The hills were inhabited by indigenous tribes, migrants from Myanmar and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, and Lusheis on the border with Mizoram. After the partition of India most of the Hindu Bengalis of the princely state moved to the Indian area of the Tripura hills, where they occupied lands used for shifting cultivation by the tribal people, and came to dominate politics. Many of the Muslims of Tripura left for East Pakistan. Shibani Kinkar Chaube wrote of Tripura in 1975, \\"After partition Bengalis have far outnumbered the tribals, who are in a miserable stage of battle for survival, expressed through occasional violence and leftist politics.\\" In 1988 one faction of the Tripura National Volunteers signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Tripura State Government and the Government of India. However, other factions formed the dissenting National Liberation Front of Tripura and the All-Tripura Tiger Force, which were both active as of 2008. As of 2005 about 30% of the population were members of scheduled tribes. There were ongoing conflicts between the tribal and non- tribal peoples of Tripura. =Assam= Foothills of the Himalayas seen from the Manas National Park, Assam Assam covers the plains of the upper portion of the flood plain of the Brahmaputra River, which flows from east to west before entering Bangladesh, where it turns to the south. The south of the state includes the plains of the Barak River basin. This river originates in the Manipur hills and flows south through the mountains of Manipur to Tipaimukh, where it makes a hairpin turn and flows north along the Manipur-Assam border to Jirimat near Lakhipur, then west through the Cachar district of Assam before entering Bangladesh. The Brahmaputra and Barak basins are separated by the Karbi Anglong and North Cachar Hills. The main ethnic group in the fertile Brahmaputra valley are the mainly Hindu Assamese people. At time of the partition of India, the Cachar district of Assam was dominated by Bengalis, and there were large Bengali populations throughout the Brahmaputra valley, swelled by Hindu refugees from East Pakistan. As of 2005 about 12.69% of the population were members of scheduled tribes. This is higher that the national average of 8%. It includes plains tribes such as the Bodo people, who are also agitating for autonomy. There are ongoing separatist movements by the hill tribes of Assam in the North Cachar Hills and the Karbi Anglong. In 2009 insurgent groups in Assam included the United Liberation Front of Asom, the Karbi Longri NC Hills Liberation Front and the Black Widow group. =Sikkim= Mangan, Sikkim that combines regular curriculum with Buddhist studies Sikkim is in the eastern Himalayas, bounded by Nepal to the east, Tibet to the north, Bhutan to the east and West Bengal to the south. Depending on altitude, the climate ranges from subtropical to alpine. The highest peak is Kangchenjunga at , the third highest in the world. The first Bhutia King of the Namgyal dynasty was installed in Sikkim in 1642. In the years that followed \\"Greater Sikkim\\" was established in the eastern Himalayas. After 1700 the kingdom went into steady decline. The remainder of the kingdom was divided between China and Britain in 1890 in a convention signed in Calcutta. In 1950 Sikkim became a protectorate of independent India. The monarchy was deposed in 1975 and Sikkim became the 22nd state of India. Sikkim was integrated as the eighth North Eastern Council state in 2002. The official languages are English, Nepali, Sikkimese and Lepcha. Additional languages include Gurung, Limbu, Magar, Mukhia, Newari, Rai, Sherpa and Tamang. The main religion is Hinduism, practiced by the Nepalese, followed by Buddhism, practiced by the Tibetans and Bhutias. Sikkim's economy is largely dependent on agriculture. Crops include rice, maize, tea, soybean, ginger, orange, pears, potato, tomato and cardamoms. Tourists attracted by the mountain scenery are also a source of income. The state has the highest earnings per person among the North-Eastern states.

The county formed part of the Nation's Apukshunnubbee a District, or Second District, one of three administrative super-regions.  History  Towson County, Choctaw Nation was named for U.S. Army Col. Nathanial Towson (1784‚Äì1854), whose name was also commemorated by the territorial-era military post, Fort Towson, and by the present-day adjacent town of Fort Towson. The military post, established in 1824, was named first.‚ÄúOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,‚Äù Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, p. 322. Towson County's boundaries were established and designated according to easily recognizable natural landmarks, as were the boundaries of all Choctaw Nation counties. The Red River formed its southern boundary; Little River was its eastern boundary; and the Kiamichi River was its western boundary. A line drawn to connect the Little and Kiamichi rivers formed its northern boundary.John W. Morris, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, plates 38 & 56. Four counties bordered Towson County: Cedar County on the north, Bok Tuklo and Red River counties on the east, and Kiamitia County on the west. Its county seat was Towson Court House, a meeting ground which is no longer extant.‚ÄúOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,‚Äù Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, p. 332. The county served as an election district for members of the National Council, and as a unit of local administration. Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger. The judge's duties included oversight of overall county administration. The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census. The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.Angie Debo, The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152.  Statehood  As Oklahoma's statehood approached, its leading citizens, who were gathered for the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, realized in laying out the future state's counties that, while logically designed, the Choctaw Nation's counties could not exist as economically viable political subdivisions. In most the county seat existed generally for holding county court and not as a population center. This conundrum was also recognized by the framers of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who met in 1905 to propose statehood for the Indian Territory. The Sequoyah Constitutional Convention also proposed a county structure that abolished the Choctaw counties. Towson County was included principally within the territory of the proposed Hitchcock County.Amos Maxwell, Sequoyah Constitutional Convention. Although the map carried in Wikipedia‚Äôs article on the State of Sequoyah speaks to the matter of borders, Maxwell's book offers further insight. Much of this proposition was borrowed two years later by Oklahoma's framers, who adopted certain of these concepts for the future Choctaw County in Oklahoma. The territory formerly comprising Towson County, Choctaw Nation was divided almost equally between Choctaw County and McCurtain County. Towson County ceased to exist upon Oklahoma‚Äôs statehood on November 16, 1907.

Her case is known through three mentions in speeches by Demosthenes - Against Boeotus I and II, and On the False Embassy - and one in Josephus. The prosecution was apparently brought by a man named Menecles, who would go on to be prosecuted in turn by Ninos' son. The date of the prosecution is uncertain: Against Boeotus I was delivered in 348, which provides a terminus ante quem; Esther Eidinow suggests a date of between 362 and 358 BC. The case was apparently well known in the mid-fourth century, as Demosthenes refers to it in his speeches as if the jury are expected to be familiar with the case. According to Demosthenes, Ninos was a priestess, and was charged with bringing together thiasoi. One scholiast on this passage says that her crime was mocking the Dionysian Mysteries; another says that she made love potions. It is unclear where the scholiast's information about love potions comes from - Eidinow suggests that it is a misinterpretation of Demosthenes' text, while Professor Matthew Dickie says that the comment \\"does not emerge from anything in the text of Demosthenes\\" and may have been derived from an Atthidographer or another speech. Finally, Josephus lists Ninos as one of five Athenians put to death for asebeia (impiety).

Allina Health Services, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held the Department of Health and Human Services' new policy to retroactively reduce Medicare payments must be vacated due to the Department's failure to uphold its notice-and-comment obligations., 139 S. Ct. 1804 (2019).  Background  In 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced on its website the \\"Medicare fractions\\" for hospitals for the year 2012. As part of the posting, CMS declared that, when determining the \\"Medicare fraction\\" of Medicare disproportionate share hospital payments, Medicare Part C days would be included in the calculations. This decision underwent a notice-and-comment period in 2013, but the Department of Health and Human Services attempted to apply its interpretation retroactively to 2012. Under the Social Security Act, a notice-and-comment period is required for a \\"rule, requirement or statement of policy\\" that establishes or changes a \\"substantive legal standard governing the scope of benefits, the payment for services, or the eligibility of individuals, entities, or organizations to furnish or receive services or benefits.\\" 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1395hh(a)(2). This requirement is stricter than the more common notice-and-comment requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act, which do not apply to \\"interpretive rules\\" or \\"general statements of policy.\\"  Procedural history  After this new payment schedule was published, a group of hospitals sued the government, claiming that the change had not properly undergone a notice-and-comment period. The Department, however, argued that it was not required to hold a notice-and-comment period for the new rule, since it was only advising the public on an existing interpretation of the law and thus that the lower standard of the Administrative Procedures Act governed, rather than the stricter requirements of the Social Security Act. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the Department and upheld the legality of the payment schedule. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, ruling in favor of the hospitals on the basis that the new payment schedule amounted to a \\"statement of policy\\" that required the notice-and-comment period specified by the Social Security Act. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.Azar v. Allina Health Services, 139 S. Ct. 51 (2018).  Opinion of the Court  In a 7‚Äì1 ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the appellate court's ruling. Writing for the Court, Justice Gorsuch found that the Department's decision rose to the level of changing a \\"substantive legal standard\\" within the meaning of the Social Security Act. He rejected the government's arguments that a \\"substantive legal standard\\" was the same as a \\"substantive rule\\" under the APA, and that since the change in payments did not amount to a \\"substantive rule\\" under the APA, it likewise didn't qualify as changing a \\"substantive legal standard.\\" Justice Breyer dissented. Justice Kavanaugh, who wrote the opinion of the D.C. Circuit prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court, took no part in the consideration of this case.

On June 22, 1922, The Washington Times wrote, \\"A dandy little number for concert work is \\"My Fidil Is Singing\\" by Floy Little Bartlett\\". The Montclair Times wrote on December 9, 1925, that Bartlett is a well-known composer. On May 22, 1923, Bartlett sang on WMAQ in Chicago. She also performed her own compositions on WEAF on January 26, 1924, which The Brooklyn Citizen wrote was \\"in her delightful soprano voice\\". In 1928, Bartlett was again featured on WMAQ. The score of her song \\"Sweet Little Woman o' Mine\\" was played in the 1925 silent film The Big Parade. Her songs \\"At Dusk\\", \\"A Boy's Philosophy\\", and \\"Naughty Boy\\" have been sung by Ida Geer Weller. Publications Bartlett published two of her compositions, \\"The Swing\\" and \\"Little Blue Ribbon\\", in 1911, which The Des Moines Register reported \\"met with instant success\\". \\"The Swing\\" had words by Robert Louis Stevenson, and \\"Little Blue Ribbon\\" had words by Austin Dobson. The second song was dedicated to the deceased Mrs. Cate Gilbert Wells from Burlington. Kitty Cheatham liked both of the compositions and asked Bartlett for several compositions, including those that were unpublished, to use them on stage. The two compositions were sold in New York City. Doubleday published The Busy Book by Bartlett about activities that children can do to keep busy. Bartlett wrote the book because of her daughter Miriam. The book includes games, puzzles, and riddles for children. The Busy Book was recommended in January 1923 in The Western Journal of Education for children in the third and fourth grades.

It is commonly used for passenger and freight services.  History  The railway line is consisting of various sections opened along Prussia and former lands of Congress Poland, which itself was part of Russian Empire. The first section was opened by Niederschliesische Zweigbahn company on 1 October 1846, running between Glogau (G≈Çog√≥w) and Sagan (≈ªaga≈Ñ) stations. Later, on 30 December 1857, the Breslau- Posen-Glogauer Eisenbahn company opened the stretch from Lissa (Leszno) to Klein Gr√§ditz (Grodziec Ma≈Çy), and on 18 May 1858 opened the subsequent section to Glogau station, along with a bridge over the river Oder. Next section was opened by Niederschlesisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn company on 31 December 1871, from Sagan to Sorau (≈ªary) station, which received another link half-a-year later, on 30 June 1872, to Forst, which already had a functioning railway connection to Cottbus. In 1888, all railways in Prussia were nationalised, and new section from Lissa to Ostrowo (Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski) was opened on 1 October. Latest Prussian section of the railway line was opened on 14 February 1896, from Ostrowo to Neu Skalmiersch√ºtz (Nowe Skalmierzyce), near the Russian-Prussian border. In Russian Empire, the first section of the line was opened 15 November 1902, as part of Warsaw-Kalisz Railway, between ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Kaliska and Kalisz stations. Unlike the Prussian railway. this section was built with, typical for Russian railways back then, track gauge of 1,524 mm instead of standard 1,435 mm. On 28 October 1906, a follow-up section to Nowe Skalmierzyce was built, along with new border station. Track gauge was unified during World War I. In the 1930s the line received a connection with a Coal Trunk-Line, which had its major terminal located in Karsznice, southeast to Zdu≈Ñska Wola. During World War II the railway's route was changed between Czekan√≥w and Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski, as well as Durzyn - Krotoszyn - Osusz section, where the Krotoszyn station was excluded from the line, and the former tracks leading to the station became the connectors with the main line. The line was partially electrified in 1965, starting with the section from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ to Zdu≈Ñska Wola. In 1973 the overhead wires were installed up to Sieradz station, followed 2 years later to Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski, and in 1987 the section to Durzyn branch post, along with connector rail to Krotoszyn station, was electrified.  Current condition  The railway line is listed by Polish government as the railway line of national importance. On the section from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ to Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski it is used by PKP Intercity trains running between Warsaw and Wroc≈Çaw, running through Skierniewice, Koluszki, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Sieradz and Kalisz, as well it serves as a backup route for trains usually running on the E-20 international railway, in case of a lack of possibility to run on it. Also, the section is commonly used by PolRegio regional trains running from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ to Pozna≈Ñ and Wroc≈Çaw. On much shorter section, between ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Sieradz, it is used by ≈ÅKA commuter trains. Currently, the section is undergoing through refurbishment, which will allow raising the speed limit of the railway from 80 to 120 km/h. The section between Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski and Leszno stations, due to no electrification, is served with diesel units; one of significant routes on the railway is a train from Ostr√≥w to Leszno ran by Koleje Wielkopolskie. However, the electrification of this section is planned. Section from Wschowa to ≈ªaga≈Ñ stations used to be impassable due to deteriorated condition of the tracks and no passenger services scheduled for this route till December 2019, when the traffic was restored between Wschowa and G≈Çog√≥w. The section from ≈ªaga≈Ñ to ≈ªary is mostly served by diesel multiple units and freight trains powered by diesel locomotives  References  Category:Railway lines in Poland Category:Transport in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Category:≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship Category:Greater Poland Voivodeship Category:Lubusz Voivodeship Category:Lower Silesian Voivodeship ","title":"≈Å√≥d≈∫‚ÄìTuplice railway"},{"id":"61218671","text":"Dr. Jerzy Wrzos (born 18 November 1936) is a Polish retired football manager, author, teacher, sport theoretician, and doctor of physical education specialising in football.

Muskova worked on a variety of pieces of legislation while in office, including bills to inform parents when their underage daughter has had an abortion, penalties against businesses caught selling alcohol to underage children, and compensation for those who were forcibly vaccinated.

The county formed part of the Nation‚Äôs Apukshunnubbee District, or Second District, one of three administrative super-regions. The subdivision was located within the current McCurtain County.  History  Bok Tuklo County, Choctaw Nation was named from the Choctaw words bok, or ‚Äúcreek,‚Äù and tuklo, or ‚Äútwo.‚Äù The two creeks commemorated by the name were Lukfata Creek and Yasho Bok (now called Yasho Creek), which ran parallel to one another north to south, across much of the county.‚ÄúOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,‚Äù Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, p. 322. Bok Tuklo County‚Äôs boundaries were established and designated according to easily recognizable natural landmarks, as were the boundaries of all Choctaw Nation counties. Little River formed its southern and eastern boundaries. The county‚Äôs eastern boundary was formed by a line drawn from a north-south stretch of Little River to an east-west section.John W. Morris, Historical Atlas of Oklahoma, plates 38 & 56. Four counties bordered Bok Tuklo County: Eagle County on the east, Red River county on the south, and Towson County on the west. Its county seat was Oak Hill, a meeting ground which is no longer extant.‚ÄúOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,‚Äù Chronicles of Oklahoma, Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, p. 322. The county served as an election district for members of the National Council, and as a unit of local administration. Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger. The judge‚Äôs duties included oversight of overall county administration. The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census. The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.Angie Debo, The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, p. 152.  Statehood  As Oklahoma‚Äôs statehood approached, its leading citizens, who were gathered for the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, realized in laying out the future state‚Äôs counties that, while logically designed, the Choctaw Nation‚Äôs counties could not exist as economically viable political subdivisions. In most the county seat existed generally for holding county court and not as a population center. This conundrum was also recognized by the framers of the proposed State of Sequoyah, who met in 1905 to propose statehood for the Indian Territory. The Sequoyah Constitutional Convention also proposed a county structure that abolished the Choctaw counties. Bok Tuklo County was included within the territory of the proposed McCurtain County.Amos Maxwell, Sequoyah Constitutional Convention. Although the map carried in Wikipedia‚Äôs article on the State of Sequoyah speaks to the matter of borders, Maxwell's book offers further insight. Much of this proposition was borrowed two years later by Oklahoma‚Äôs framers, who adopted certain of these concepts for the future McCurtain County in Oklahoma. The territory formerly comprising Bok Tuklo County, Choctaw Nation was wholly incorporated into McCurtain County. Bok Tuklo County ceased to exist upon Oklahoma‚Äôs statehood on November 16, 1907.

She was one of the founders of London's Black Lesbian and Gay Centre.  Early life and education  Hensman was born in Sri Lanka but moved to the United Kingdom at the age of two, growing up in Hackney. She studied chemical engineering at University College London, graduating in 1982. However, was later unable to find any work in chemical engineering, so instead, joined a lab as a research assistant.  Research and career  Hensman helped to launch the London's Black Lesbian and Gay Centre in 1985. At the time, the centre was supported by the Greater London Council and housed in an annex of Tottenham Town Hall. In the late 1980s, Hensman joined the Haringey Council's Lesbian and Gay Sub-Committee and was involved with the campaign against Section 28. As well as this, Hensman was involved in the Positive Images group and Haringey Black Action (late 1890s). Hensman worked for many years and is currently an involvement coordinator in health research. As a member of the Christian Church, Hensman campaigns for a more inclusive community, writing on the inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in religious communities. In October 2018, she wrote an LGBT briefing paper that was presented to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Hensman is a regular contributor to Ekklesia, who published her first book in 2015. She has also written for The Guardian, as well as writing poetry. In 2016, Hensman joined King's College London as the Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) Coordinator for the Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care, South London (CLAHRC). She worked with researchers, service users, carers and communities in order to accumulate research that reflected the views and priorities of local people.

Dating back to 1924, the choir became the radio choir of a predecessor of the MDR in 1946, then called Kammerchor des Senders Leipzig, or Rundfunkchor Leipzig. The present name was established in 1992. The choir has appeared internationally, and has made award-winning recordings.  History  The origin of the later MDR Rundfunkchor was a choir called Leipziger Oratorienvereinigung (Leipzig oratorio association), that appeared first on 14 December 1924 in a broadcast of the (MIRAG) of Haydn's Die Sch√∂pfung, conducted by Alfred Szendrei. A 1931 broadcast featured a Leipziger Solistenchor (Leipzig soloists choir). The choir was renamed on 1 July 1934, as Kammerchor des Reichssenders Leipzig, when the broadcaster became Reichssender Leipzig. In 1934, the future choirmaster Heinrich Werl√© appeared frequently as guest conductor. From 1935 to 1940, Curt Kretzschmar was choral director. The first surviving recordings date back to 1937: A cappella recording with folk songs and radio recording of the Aria of Marie from Donizetti's La fille du r√©giment conducted by Curt Kretzschmar. In May 1941, the choir was delegated to the Reichssender M√ºnchen. At the end of 1942, the choir was dissolved. Fourteen former choir members were taken over by the Bruckner Choir St. Florian Monastery of the Gro√üdeutscher Rundfunk from 1943 to 1945. This was taken over by Thomaskantor G√ºnther Ramin and transferred to Linz in 1944. After World War II, the choir was taken over by the new Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk. Conducted by Heinrich Werl√©, it was formed by 27 singers, women and men. He was supported by Dietrich Knothe from 1952 on (dismissed for political reasons in October 1962), which was intended primarily for a cappella works and rehearsals. The concert tour through Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland and Sweden) in October 1957 marked the choir's international breakthrough. In the same year the choir gave a guest performance in CSSR. In 1964, Horst Neumann was engaged as guest conductor; from 1967 to 1978, and thus as successor to Armin Oeser, he was choir director. From 1969 the choir gave concerts for schoolchildren. From 1978 to 1980 the choir had three interim conductors: Jochen Wehner, Gerhard Richter and Gert Frischmuth. In 1980, J√∂rg-Peter Weigle took over the direction of the choir and from 1985 onwards the chief conductor. In 1982 the choir and the MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra gave guest performances in Japan conducted by Wolf-Dieter Hauschild. Gert Frischmuth became chief conductor in 1988 and choir director in 1992. In January 1989 the choir was the first ensemble from the GDR to perform in Israel under Kurt Masur's direction. In January 1992, the broadcaster was reorganised, and the choir renamed MDR Rundfunkchor. On the occasion of its 50th anniversary the choir gave a jubilee concert in 1996 Howard Arman was choral conductor from 1998. The choir toured to Qatar several times between 2008 and 2014, followed by concerts in France, Italy, Monaco and Switzerland. Risto Joost was artistic director from 2015 to 2020. Philipp Ahmann has been the choir's first guest conductor between 2013 and 2016, and has been appointed as artistic director in 2020. The MDR Rundfunkchor has an extensive repertoire (a cappella, choral symphonic works, ensemble singing, secular and sacred music). In addition, it has appeared as a special ensemble for Neue Musik with numerous premieres and world premieresCf. J√∂rg Clemen, Steffen Lieberwirth: Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk.

As a musician, he is known for his solo career, as well as Hunx and His Punx and Gravy Train!!!!. As a visual artist, Bogart's paintings and sculptures have been exhibited in galleries throughout the United States, and he has created the World of Wonder web series Feelin' Fruity. He also runs the streetwear line Wacky Wacko. Pitchfork named Bogart the \\"New King of Camp\\" in 2016.  Early life and career  Bogart grew up in Tucson, Arizona, where his father was a lawyer and his mother was a nurse. In high school, he started playing the guitar and created the punk zine Puberty Strike. He later produced the zine Psycho No. 1 Fan. When Bogart was 18, his father committed suicide. He moved to Oakland, California shortly thereafter. At 19, he went to beauty school, and later, in 2006, he co-founded the salon and vintage clothing store Down at Lulu's on Telegraph Avenue in Oakland.  Music  Bogart joined Oakland-based electroclash band Gravy Train!!!! as a backup dancer under the name Hunx shortly after its inception in the early 2000s. He soon began writing songs for the band and performing as the band's singer and guitarist. In 2008, he founded Hunx and His Punx, a garage punk band, which changed its lineup in 2010 and was renamed to Hunx and His Punkettes. After this lineup disbanded in 2011, Bogart sold Down at Lulu's. In 2012, Bogart released a solo album as Hunx titled Hairdresser Blues, and, in 2015, Bogart came out with an eponymous solo album under his own name.  Clothing  Bogart relocated to Los Angeles in 2013, and, in 2014, he started streetwear label Wacky Wacko. Initially, it was to be a record label, until he lost interest in that idea. The line grew in popularity, and could be seen on Miley Cyrus, Tavi Gevinson, and Kathleen Hanna. From 2014‚Äì17, the label had a store on Sunset Boulevard in Echo Park. Bogart has also collaborated with fashion house Saint Laurent. Director Hedi Slimane was a fan of Bogart's work, and used his drawings in a Saint Laurent fabric pattern and a song by Hunx and His Punx in a promotional video.  Video  In 2011, Bogart and longtime collaborator Brande Bytheway launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a TV show. Hollywood Nailz launched as a web series in November 2012, and was likened to a \\"bizarro '80s Public Access-style variety show\\". In May 2018, World of Wonder launched the web series Feelin' Fruity, a variety show which starred Bogart, and was inspired by Disneyland's Toontown and Pee-wee's Playhouse. It featured such guests as Alice Bag, Kate Berlant, Tammie Brown, John Early, Cole Escola, Manila Luzon, and Allison Wolfe.  Sculpture and paintings  Bogart began taking classes at ArtCenter College of Design in 2013, and began selling ceramic versions of familiar objects‚Äîincluding perfume bottles and grooming supplies‚Äîat the Wacky Wacko store shortly thereafter. In 2014, Los Angeles art gallery 365 Mission included a painting by Bogart in a group show, and, in 2015, 365 Mission gave him a solo show, in which he transformed the gallery space into The Seth Bogart Show, an immersive experience that displayed sculpture, paintings, ceramics, and video, as well as served as a performance venue. Nino Mier gave Bogart a show in their Los Angeles gallery in 2018. Entitled Lick, it transformed the space into a sex shop, and included paintings and ceramic pieces by Bogart. In 2019, Chicago's Soccer Club Club gallery hosted 100 Toothbrushes, a solo exhibit of 100 ceramic toothbrushes by Bogart.  Personal life  Bogart is openly gay. He came out to his friends while in high school, and to his mother when he was eighteen.

For almost two centuries they ruled over the entire region of Kavaj√´ and large parts of the Myzeqe plains. They are thought to be the descendants of Kapudan Pasha, a beylerbey and great admiral from Ulqin who was likely the son in law of Sultan Ahmed. Their great wealth was accumulated through sea trade, especially in the exports of livestock. The Alltuni made alliances with the Bushatlliu family of Shkod√´r who later rebelled against the Sublime Porte.

The south-western section of the M3 Road is the 1st section of a shortcut that exists between the Luapula and Copperbelt Provinces of Zambia, as the area in-between the 2 provinces is owned by the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the Chembe Bridge, the M3 becomes the Congo Pedicle road to the Copperbelt, which is a road maintained by Zambia on Congolese Territory. Route The M3 Road begins in Kasama (Capital of the Northern Province), at a junction with the M1 Road in the city centre next to the Kasama Golf Course. It goes westwards for 24 kilometres, bypassing Kasama Airport, to reach a junction with the D20 Road, which provides access to the Chishimba Falls and the town of Mporokoso in the northwest. From the D20 junction, the M3 continues westwards for 135 kilometres to the town of Luwingu in the district of the same name. Just after Luwingu, the M3 Road crosses into the Luapula Province. From Luwingu, the road goes westwards for 100 kilometres to reach a t-junction with the M13 Road in Chipili District. As the M13 Road ends at this junction, the M3 Road becomes the road southwards. It proceeds for 78 kilometres, through the town of Chipili, to the city of Mansa (Capital of the Luapula Province). In Mansa, the M3 meets the D94 Road, which provides access to the town of Samfya on the south-western shore of Lake Bangweulu. From Mansa, the M3 road goes southwards for 90 kilometres to reach Chembe, where it crosses the Luapula River as the Mwanawasa Bridge (named after Levy Mwanawasa) into the Democratic Republic of the Congo to become the Congo Pedicle road, which is a road maintained by Zambia on Congolese territory and which is used as a shortcut for motorists travelling from the Luapula Province (and Northern Province) to the Copperbelt Province (and North-Western Province). It becomes the M5 Road at the Copperbelt end of the Congo Pedicle Road. The Congo Pedicle Road is designated as the N36 Route on the DR Congo road network. Congo Pedicle road The Congo Pedicle road is an important road, as it provides motorists in towns located in the Luapula province with easier access to towns located in the Copperbelt and North-Western provinces. It provides a much shorter route than the very-long circular route through Samfya, Serenje and Kapiri Mposhi for motorists wanting to travel from Mansa to the north-western area of the country and to the country's industrial and commercial hub of the Copperbelt. The M3 Road is the road that provides access to the Congo Pedicle territory and eventually the town of Mufulira in the Copperbelt Province from the towns of the Luapula province, making it an important route for motorists planning to save on fuel and planning to avoid spending hours on the road.

Burn was born in Yester in East Lothian in 1759. His career in bridge design started in 1797, when he worked with his elder brother James Burn on a bridge at Inverbervie. In 1798 he designed and built a two-span bridge at Bilsdean in East Lothian, and between 1800 and 1804 he built a number of bridges over rivers in Moray, including the Bridge of Avon at Ballindalloch, which is now a Category A listed building, as well as a number of ecclesiastical buildings, including two churches in Dingwall and Huntly, and a chapel in the Gordon Estate. He encountered financial difficulties connected with his work on the Spey Bridge at Fochabers, which led to his estate being sequestered in 1803. By 1806 he was living in Wick, Caithness, working mainly as a masonry contractor on a number of bridges designed by Thomas Telford. A spell of ill-health forced him to be absent from some of the work on Telford's bridges, which exacerbated his financial problems, but the projects were nonetheless completed successfully. In his later career, Burn worked on a number of harbour development projects. Telford recommended Burn to the British Fisheries Society in 1806 to work on the improvement of the fishing station at Pultneytown, where he built the piers and associated breastwork that formed the harbour. After that, he went on to work on other harbour construction projects in Kirkwall and Portmahomack. Burn continued to live in Wick until his death, around 1820.

It operates four primary regional stations under three concessions in Culiac√°n, Mazatl√°n, and Ciudad Obreg√≥n/Los Mochis, broadcasting as virtual channel 10. History The first TVP station, XHQ-TV in Culiac√°n, signed on September 17, 1964. XHQ, the first television station in the state of Sinaloa, broadcast on analog channel 3 and was owned by TV de Culiac√°n, S.A. de C.V., co-owned by Rodolfo Rodr√≠guez Arnold and Francisco Madero Herrera. Even while XHQ was signing on, the ground was being laid for the second TVP station. On August 29, 1965, Ciudad Obreg√≥n's XHI-TV channel 2 went on the air, transmitting from a tower at its in-town studio site. However, the tower was toppled by Tropical Storm Kirsten on September 27, 1966; XHI ultimately rebuilt full-power facilities atop Cerro Yucuribampo. On December 18, 1967, test transmissions began at the Mazatl√°n station, XHMZ- TV channel 7, owned by Televisi√≥n del Pac√≠fico, S.A. The Mazatl√°n station was started in association with √ìscar P√©rez Escobosa, who already owned XERJ and later bought XETK radio. XHMZ began formal broadcasts on October 12, 1968, in time for the opening ceremony of the 1968 Summer Olympics. After the initial three stations were built, further expansion of Televisoras Grupo Pac√≠fico, as the group was known, did not occur until 1988, when XHI built a repeater on Cerro de la Memoria in Los Mochis, more than from Ciudad Obreg√≥n. The Los Mochis repeater, while still licensed as such, soon turned into a full-fledged local station with its own programming. XHI later added a repeater in the late 2000s on Cerro del Vig√≠a, broadcasting on channel 34, to serve Empalme and Guaymas; for a short time, the station produced local news for the Guaymas area. Prior to 2016, each station was known by its local channel number (2, 3 and 7). However, that year, virtual channels were realigned across Mexico, and each of those channel numbers was assigned to a national network. In conjunction with a virtual channel change to 10 in all areas, Televisoras Grupo Pac√≠fico rebranded as \\"TVP\\". Historically, TVP was a Televisa partner, and the TVP stations aired programming from Gala TV and FOROtv. However, this relationship, like many of its kind, ended in 2018, though TVP's concessionaires remain designated as part of the preponderant economic agent in broadcasting.

The confraternity is one of the oldest institutions in the municipality of Mafra. It organizes the Corpus Christi solemnity and organizes the four traditional processions of the season of Lent in Mafra: *The procession of the Passion of the Lord (Portuguese: Prociss√£o do Senhor Jesus dos Passos); *The procession of Penance of the Third Order of Saint Francis (Portuguese: Prociss√£o de Penit√™ncia da Ordem Terceira de S√£o Francisco); *The procession of Seven Sorrows of Our Lady (Portuguese: Prociss√£o das Sete Dores de Nossa Senhora); and *The procession of the Burial of the Lord (Portuguese: Prociss√£o do Enterro do Senhor). Over time, the confraternity has been the custodian of several relics. Those include Louis XV of France's coronation shirt, which he wore for the ceremony in Reims Cathedral. The confraternity also holds the largest collection of processional mannequin-style images (Portuguese: imagens de vestir or imagens de roca) in the country. Some of these are still used for religious processions.Henriques, Tiago, \\"A Real e Vener√°vel Irmandade do Sant√≠ssimo Sacramento da Par√≥quia de Santo Andr√© de Mafra ‚Äì A Antiga e Nobre Colegiada de Santo Andr√© da Vila de Mafra e a Institui√ß√£o da Irmandade do Sant√≠ssimo Sacramento\\", in Mafra Sacra : mem√≥ria & patrim√≥nio, 1717-2017 (...), p. 167-177. Part of the confraternity ceremonies and religious functions take place with the sound of the basilica's six historical pipe organs and two Mafra carillons.  History  The confraternity was created in the 16th century, at the St. Andrew's Church. The first record of the confraternity appears in a will dated 14 March 1597, and the oldest document of the confraternity is the Statutes agreement of 5 June 1725. Dom Tom√°s Xavier de Lima, 13th Viscount of Vila Nova de Cerveira and 1st Marquis of Ponte de Lima, Secretary of State of the Kingdom of Portugal from 1 April 1786 to 15 December 1788, was a member of the confraternity. Another member was the Capit√£o-Mor (High-Captain) of Mafra, Jos√© M√°ximo de Carvalho, mentioned by William Beckford in his diary.Memoirs of William Beckford of Fonthill, author of Vathek p. 327-328. In 1835, after the extinction of religious orders in Portugal, the confraternity moved to the Basilica of Our Lady and St. Anthony in Mafra, at the invitation of Queen Maria II of Portugal. In 1866 the Civil Government bequeathed the assets of the extinct Third Order of St. Francis to this institution,Chaves, Duarte Nuno, \\"A Prociss√£o de Penit√™ncia da Vener√°vel Ordem Terceira e as Suas Imagens de Vestir ‚Äì Mem√≥rias Franciscanas da Sacra e Real Bas√≠lica de Nossa Senhora e Santo Ant√≥nio\\", in Mafra Sacra : mem√≥ria & patrim√≥nio, 1717-2017 (...), p. 305-325. and later also received the assets of the extinct Confraternity of the Lord Jesus of the Steps of Mafra (Portuguese: Irmandade do Senhor Jesus dos Passos de Mafra),Costa, Alexandre, e Felgueiras, Ant√≥nio, \\"Paix√£o e Morte do Senhor Jesus ‚Äì Express√µes de Piedade na Vila de Mafra\\", in Mafra Sacra : mem√≥ria & patrim√≥nio, 1717-2017 (...), p. 371-390. while assigning to the confraternity the responsibility of organising all processions according to the local religious calendar. The confraternity remained under the patronage of the Portuguese monarchy until the proclamation of the Republic in 1910. Manuel II, the last King of Portugal was a lifetime honorary member of the confraternity. In 1953, after the return of the Procession of the Seven Sorrows of Our Lady, the confraternity received the assets of the extinct Confraternity of Our Lady of Sorrows of Mafra (Irmandade de Nossa Senhora das Dores de Mafra, in Portuguese), again with the responsibility of organising this procession annually.Figueiredo, Padre Ricardo, \\"A Devo√ß√£o √†s Sete Dores de Nossa Senhora: Hist√≥ria, Piedade e Teologia\\", in Mafra Sacra : mem√≥ria & patrim√≥nio, 1717-2017 (...), p. 393-407.  Traditional Lent season processions in Mafra  The processions of Lent in Mafra started in the 18th century. Thanks to conservation and restoration efforts, these ceremonies maintain the grand Baroque flair. These processions were officially declared by the Municipality as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Municipal Interest. = Procession of the Passion of the Lord (Via Crucis) = This is one of the oldest expressions of piety in Mafra, and originated from the old collegiate church of St. Andrew‚Äôs in the 17th century. It takes place on the second Sunday of Lent, which is also known as the Procession of Encounter, and is composed of two processions that join at a determined moment of the route. The Procession of the Passion of the Lord exits from the basilica of the Royal Building of Mafra and of Our Lady of Solitude which exits from Campo Santo Chapel, also located in the Royal Building of Mafra. = Procession of Penance of the Third Order of Saint Francis = The first procession occurred on the 27th of March 1740, as a religious festivity directly related to the work of the Third Order of Saint Francis of Mafra patron, King John V. This procession occurs on the fourth Sunday of Lent. Its processional protocol has remained unchanged since inception by Brother Matias da Concei√ß√£o, Librarian of the Convent of Mafra. It is therefore a unique cultural manifestation of the solemn and elaborate Baroque period. The images of the 10 religious litters, alluding to the history of the Franciscans, were created by sculptor Manuel Dias. Most of these pieces still have the original vestments acquired by Jo√£o Pedro Ludovice, son of Johann Friedrich Ludwig, the architect in charge of the Royal Building of Mafra. The crucifix used in the litter of the stigmatisation of St. Francis in Mount La Verna is attributed to Anton Maria Maragliano, a genoese sculptor of the Baroque period.

It takes place on Palm Sunday, the Sunday before Friday of Sorrows celebrating the Feast of the Seven Sorrows of Our Lady. The procession is composed of seven religious litters corresponding to the seven sorrows of the Mother of Jesus, and an eighth, with the image of Our Lady of Sorrows. It comprises more than fifty images attributed to the sculptor Joaquim Jos√© de Barros Labor√£o, one of the last masters from the School of Sculpture of Mafra, according to Armindo Ayres de Carvalho. This procession is popularly known as ‚ÄúProcession of the Little Donkey‚Äù (Portuguese: Prociss√£o da Burrinha), originally depicted in the religious litter of the flight into Egypt, in which the Virgin is depicted as seated on a donkey. = Procession of the Burial of the Lord = The exact origin of this procession is uncertain. It takes place on the night of Good Friday. In 1773, the Third Order of St. Francis commissioned a new image of Our Lady of Solitude, this same image still used on the procession. This solemn procession, represents the death of Our Lord Jesus Christ. The silent funeral procession, is accompanied by Veronica‚Äôs and The Three Marys lamentations. This ancient Catholic tradition, and unique to Mafra, is accompanied by the Centurion, a typical figure in the town‚Äôs folk art, dressed in original vestments dating back to the 18th century.

He founded the Shaklee Corporation with his sons. Dr. Forrest C. Shaklee is credited with creating the first vitamin in the United States. Early life Shaklee was born in Carlisle, Iowa to farmers Robert and Martha. At birth he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was expected not to live long. His parents believed the only treatment for tuberculosis was good food, fresh air, and plenty of rest. Therefore, they moved to Moorland, a township just outside of Fort Dodge in northern Iowa away from the soot and smoke of the Carlisle coalmines. As a teen, his doctors were satisfied he had recovered fully from tuberculosis. Shaklee studied the relationship between health, general vitality, intelligence, and proper nutrition. His philosophy became one of active, positive thinking. In his studies, Shaklee read and was influenced by Bernarr MacFadden's belief that drugs often covered or masked symptoms but did little to cure a patient. With this information, coupled with years of being in and observing nature, Shaklee wanted to treat people via nature and natural methods. This in turn, increased his interest in the growing science of chiropractic care. Formative years In 1912 Shaklee read about the discoveries of Polish scientist Casimir Funk who isolated natural substances he dubbed ‚Äúvitamins‚Äù. Shaklee began corresponding with Funk and expressed interest in developing practical applications from Funk‚Äôs research. After graduating in June 1915 from Palmer College of Chiropractic Medicine, Shaklee created ‚ÄúShaklee‚Äôs Vitalized Minerals,‚Äù the first multivitamin formulated in the United States. He began selling his supplement to patients. In this same year, Shaklee married Ruth Chapin whom he met at a church function. In 1916, at 22 years of age, Shaklee purchased his first medical clinic. A year later, the couple gave birth to their first son, Forrest Jr. In 1918, the Shaklee family moved to Fort Dodge, Iowa where Shaklee opened his second and much larger facility. Equipped with 32 treatment rooms and a 15-bed sanatorium, Shaklee began treating large volumes of patients for nutritional deficiencies. In December 1921, Shaklee‚Äôs second son, Raleigh, was born. Shaklee was very involved with his local church. In 1928 a new church opened in Portland, Iowa and he was asked to be its full-time pastor on Sundays. In 1929 church elders officially ordained Shaklee as a minister. Growing interest in nutrition In the winter of 1929, a fire destroyed Shaklee‚Äôs Iowa clinic. Instead of rebuilding, Shaklee decided to see the country. He reached Eugene, Oregon where he knew with the rich soils and favorable conditions, he could grow quality herbs and vegetables for his nutritional supplements. However, the rain impacted his health so he then relocated to Oakland, California. In Oakland, Shaklee continued his study between the relationship of nutrition and human health. In addition to ongoing research, Shaklee‚Äôs reputation grew and he frequently lectured to large crowds regarding nutrition and the use of vitamins. Up to 1933 Shaklee continued his education and earned three different degrees: Professor of Chiropractic, Doctor of Naturopathy and Doctor of Divinity. Shaklee opened the Shaklee Clinic in Oakland, California in 1935 while also on the faculty as a professor of biochemistry at the California Chiropractic College. Thoughtsmanship In 1941, his wife Ruth was killed by an automobile whilst crossing a street. While taking time to mourn, Shaklee developed a philosophy of ‚ÄúThoughtsmanship‚Äù which was centered on becoming more aware of one's emotions, surroundings and the moment. The modern term is mindfulness. Shaklee began writing a series of articles on the mind's influence on an individual's health and well-being. Shaklee wrote Thoughtsmanship in 1947. The concept became popular and Shaklee lectured on the subject in California. He published four volumes on Thoughtsmanship.  Shaklee Corporation  In the fall of 1955 at the age of 62, Shaklee and his two sons established a business to create, manufacture, and sell food supplements. The Shaklee Corporation was incorporated on April 1, 1956. Its first product, Pro-Lecin Nibblers was the first multivitamin created and formulated in the United States. They were made from a mixture of protein, vitamins, and lecithin. Later that year, Shaklee formulated additional multivitamins in creating Vita-Lea, a multivitamin, multi-mineral supplement in tablet form which is still sold by the Shaklee Corporation today. Shaklee‚Äôs concept of ‚Äúthoughtsmanship‚Äù informed how he created his sales team and corporate operations. Shaklee recruited independent contractors who were compensated through a percentage of their generated sales. In the company‚Äôs first recruiting effort, the company placed an ad in the Oakland Tribune. All of the six people who answered the add signed on as distributors. Shaklee‚Äôs belief that independent distributorships were the key to the company‚Äôs success proved true. By 1960, distributors were selling throughout California. Shaklee and his sons continually travelled across the state because each wanted to meet the distributors personally. During this time, the Shaklee Corporation continued to introduce new products. In 1972 Shaklee instructed his company to remove phosphates from the detergents they sold. They were the first major products company to sell phosphate free laundry detergents in the United States.  Personal life  On August 8, 1957 Shaklee married Dorothy Potter. On December 15, 1985 Shaklee died from a heart attack in his home at Castro Valley, California. He was 91 years old and acting chairman emeritus of the Shaklee Corporation.

Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 3, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì, accessed July 5, 2019. Born near Quimper, France around 1730, Corol√®re is believed to have come to New France as a military recruit. By 1750 he was a military drummer in the grenadier and gunner company. On January 26, 1751, he was involved in a duel against a man named Coffre; however, as duelling was illegal in New France, Corol√®re was arrested and sentenced to death. Coffre could not be arrested or tried, as he fled to parts unknown as soon as he learned that he was at risk of arrest. In New France in that era, a man who had been sentenced to death could have his life spared if he agreed to accept the job of executioner; a female prisoner, meanwhile, could have her life spared if the executioner agreed to marry her.\\"Historic love\\". Welland Tribune, February 14, 2011. While in prison, Corol√®re's cell was next to that of Fran√ßoise Laurent, a young servant who had been sentenced to death for stealing clothes from her employers, and the two appear to have developed a relationship inside the prison walls; on August 17, 1751, Corol√®re petitioned to accept the job of executioner, saving his own life, and the following day, he petitioned to marry Laurent, saving hers. He appears to have held the job of executioner for approximately a year, and there are no known historical records of his or Laurent's whereabouts after April 1752. The story of Corol√®re and Laurent has been explored in several contemporary works, including Margaret Atwood's poem \\"Marrying the Hangman\\",\\"Atwood poem inspires stage production\\". Toronto.com, August 3, 2010. Naomi McCormack's short historical drama film The Hangman's Bride,\\"The Hangman's Bride\\".

Quill & Quire, September 2011. Nearly all such works explore the story from Laurent's perspective rather than Corol√®re's, often positing that Laurent was in fact the one who convinced Corol√®re to accept the job and marry her, although none of the original historical records establish whether Corol√®re or Laurent was the real architect of the decision.

The story follows the life of a woman who refuses to follow the working habits of her coworkers and bosses. The book and its sequel were adapted by Satoko Okudera into a 2019 TBS television drama starring Yuriko Yoshitaka that drew international attention for its criticisms of Japanese corporate life.  Plot  After growing up with a father whose corporate life meant that he did not spend time with his family, office worker Yui Higashiyama decides that she will never work overtime, and regularly leaves work at the official end of the day. This places her in conflict with other employees, who usually stay at work until much later, and with her bosses at the company, who see her refusal to work overtime as a lack of commitment to the company and its clients. Her situation is complicated by the arrival of an ex-boyfriend who joins the company. Higashiyama gradually convinces her fellow workers to go home on time in order to save their health and relationships, but ends up breaking her original commitment, which results in her hospitalization and the demise of her own relationship with her fianc√©.  Publication and reception  During a period of high unemployment, Kaeruko Akeno worked at a \\"black company\\" that placed excessive demands on its employees. Her negative experiences and her disapproval of the work habits of career employees inspired the character of Yui Higashiyama. The story was originally serialized in the Shinchosha magazine Yom yom. On March 30, 2018, it was published by Shinchosha in a single volume. The Sankei Shimbun reviewed the book as an \\"editor's recommendation\\", with the editor noting the book's potential to spark conversations about working life among its readers. A sequel, titled Watashi, Teiji de Kaerimasu HYPER, was released in 2019.  Television adaptation  In 2019, the novel and its sequel were adapted by screenwriter Satoko Okudera into a TBS drama starring Yuriko Yoshitaka as Yui Higashiyama. The show's theme song, \\"Ambitious\\", was performed by Japanese band Superfly. A review in The New York Times called the show a \\"modest television hit\\" and noted that it had prompted conversations about work-life balance in Japan, but also observed that the television adaptation had a much more positive ending than the original novel. Writing for The Japan Times, reviewer Philip Brasor criticized the show for trying to address issues such as gender discrimination and work hierarchies rather than focusing on the comic potential of the main character's unusual choices. A large earthquake in Niigata Prefecture occurred during the show's final episode, leading the broadcast to be suspended halfway through the episode and rescheduled for a later date.

Published in 1951, it combines traits of classical Golden Age murder mystery ‚Äì a group of guests in a snowed in country house ‚Äì with the realities of post-war Britain. The book was republished in 2017, with both Mark Lawson in The Guardian and Marcel Berlins in The Sunday Times listing it as one of the best crime novels of the year. In 2019 The Guardian included the novel in the list of Top 10 golden age detective novels. List of characters * Old Lord Thomas Warbeck, a peer. * Robert Warbeck, the only son of Lord Warbeck. * Sir Julius Warbeck, first cousin of Lord Warbeck, M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer. * Mrs. Carstairs, a daughter of rector of the local parish for many years; a wife of Alan Carstairs who is a colleague of Sir Julius and his likely successor at the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. * Lady Camilla Prendergast, counted as a member of the family. * James Rogers, sergeant in the Metropolitan Police, assigned as a personal guard to Sir Julius. * Briggs, a butler in Warbeck Hall. * Susan, Briggs's daughter. * Wenceslaus Bottwink, Ph.D., Professor of History. Born in Hungary, having Jewish and Russian blood in his make-up, he was a citizen of Austria, then Czechoslovakia, then Germany as the Second World War progressed. Fortunate to escape a Nazi concentration camp, he found himself on the shores of Great Britain. Plot During dinner, Robert Warbeck, the only son and heir of the old Lord, dies in front of the other guests. Because of heavy snowfall Warbeck Hall is cut off the outer world, and the phone line is broken. Detective Rogers takes upon himself the task of investigating the murder. Soon after the old Lord Warbeck, already being on his last legs, dies. A silent panic strikes the guests, who try to keep together. Still, another guest dies, this time it is Mrs. Carstairs. Both Robert Warbeck and Mrs. Carstairs seem to have been poisoned. Doctor Bottwink, who was originally invited to study centuries-old documents in the family library, becomes a witness to the dreadful events. Trying to make sense of the deaths, he finds the murderer. Political and social context The novel was published in 1951, six years after the end of the Second World War, from which Great Britain came as one of the victors. Nevertheless, its position as a superpower became increasingly shaky as it was losing colonies and influence in world politics. In 1945 general election the Labour Party secured an unexpected landslide victory, and was re-elected in 1950 albeit with a much- reduced majority. The left-leaning government enacted much of the post-war consensus policies, especially the welfare state and nationalisation of some industries; it was marked by post-war austerity measures, in giving independence to India, in partitioning Palestine and forming Israel, and engagement in the Cold War against Soviet Union. Reflecting changes in the convoluted marriage of democratic and royal laws and customs of Great Britain, the novel has an underlying theme of social transformation. The ailing and death of old Lord Warbeck are a symbol of old order and traditions disappearing. He is sorry for his son, Robert, who \\"have had the misfortune to be born into the first generation of the dispossessed\\". Robert Warbeck, opposing the new course of the Labour government that \\"has gone about to destroy tradition ‚Äî to destroy us ‚Äî to destroy our country\\", has organized a fascist League of Liberty and Justice, an antisemitic and anti-socialist organization. Robert cannot contain his political leanings even when talking to Lady Camilla, finding fault with Doctor Bottwink, \\"Has your new Jew friend asked you to go back to Palestine with him yet?\\" Doctor Bottwink, a well- educated Jew from Eastern Europe, who managed to escape Nazi concentration camp, is sympathetic to Communist ideas but despises Soviet Stalinism. Sergeant Rogers inquires Doctor Bottwink whether the Doctor was in Vienna during Dolfuss r√©gime, and Doctor Bottwink clarifies that he was anti-Dolfuss, anti-clerical, and anti-Fascist. Sir Julius identifies himself as socialist despite being a first cousin of Lord Warbeck. He occupies the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer in \\"the most advanced socialist government of Western Europe\\". He considers post-war Great Britain a world where \\"the owners of historic mansions are pitiable anachronisms, helplessly awaiting the hour when the advancing tread of social justice would force them from the privileged positions they had too long usurped\\". When Sir Julius thinks back about the murders that occurred in Warbeck Hall, he comes to a conclusion that it was him who was targeted, and only by chance he was spared. \\"Who are the real enemies of communism today? Why, we are ‚Äî the democratic socialists of Western Europe!\\" exclaims Sir Julius, blaming Doctor Bottwink in the murders. As an example of re-evaluation of British foreign endeavours, Sir Julius and Mrs. Carstairs clash over a Chinese gong, used by Briggs to signal for meal. \\"I remember my father telling me it came from the loot of the Winter Palace at Pekin. Great days! Great days!\\" observes Sir Julius. \\"Surely, Sir Julius, you don't suggest that the sack of the Winter Palace was a creditable episode in our history?\\" breaks in Mrs. Carstairs, and the acrid discussion proceeds on the events surrounding the Boxer revolt of 1900. Reissued at the time when Brexit became a reality and the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn achieved the biggest percentage-point increase in its vote share since 1945, the novel regains its relevance amid the contentions of 21st century politics. Adaptations =Film= ;A Very English Murder (1974) The novel was made into a 1974 movie directed by Samson Samsonov at Mosfilm studio in the Soviet Union. Overall, the film closely follows the novel. The introduction is compressed with all guests arriving by car. The excursion undertaken by Sir Julius to a nearby village (Chapter XIV in the novel) did not make it to the film.

Early life Priest was born on March 13, 1843, in Acton, Massachusetts, to John P. Priest and Sarah C. Davis. When he was twelve his family moved to Charlestown. He graduated from Charlestown High School in 1860 and worked for a time in a provision store. On August 5, 1862, he enlisted in the Union Army and was mustered into Co B, 36th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry on August 26, 1862. On June 3, 1864, he received a gun shot wound at the Battle of Cold Harbor and lost one of his legs as a result. He was discharged for his wounds on June 17, 1865, and worked as a bookkeeper for a dry goods business upon his return home. On October 14, 1875, he married Harriet \\"Hattie\\" E. Beddoe. Government service In 1866, Priest was appointed clerk of the Charlestown Common Council. In 1871 he became city clerk of Charlestown. In 1874, Charlestown was annexed by Boston and Priest became an assistant city clerk. On September 12, 1899, city clerk J. Mitchel Galvin suddenly resigned and Priest became acting city clerk. However, Priest had to undergo an operation on his amputated leg, which led to Galvin returning as city clerk pro tempore on December 27, 1899. Priest received some support on the common council to succeed Galvin, but Edward J. Donovan was ultimately chosen. Priest again became acting city clerk following Donovan's death on January 5, 1908. The board of aldermen remained deadlocked on Donovan's successor until February 10 when, on the 30th ballot taken since Donovan's death, Priest was elected by six Republicans and two Democrats. On February 20, the Boston Common Council voted 40 to 32 to make Priest city clerk. His election was made possible by eleven Democrats who broke with their party and voted for Priest over their party's candidate, former Congressman William S. McNary. McNary's defeat was blamed on Ward 9 political leader James Donovan, who opposed McNary on political grounds. Priest remained city clerk until his death from Bright's Disease on April 3, 1912.

Morris, was an American archeologist known for his contributions to Southwest archaeology. He is also believed to have been an inspiration for the character Indiana Jones from George Lucas' popular Indiana Jones franchise. He was born on October 24, 1889 in New Mexico, grew up near what became the Aztec Ruins National Monument, and died on June 24, 1956 in Boulder, Colorado. After his death, Morris was buried in Aztec, New Mexico. Earl Morris Early Life and Family Born in 1889 in Chama, New Mexico Territory, Earl Morris was the only child of Juliette Amanda Halstead and Scott Neering Morris. What would become Earl's lifelong interest in Native American material culture began with his father, who was a collector of Native American antiquities and pothunter. Earl married fellow archaeologist Ann Axtell in 1923 and they had two daughters, Elizabeth Ann and Sarah Lane. Elizabeth later went on to get a degree in anthropology from the University of Arizona. After a lingering illness Ann died in 1945. In 1947, he married Lucile Bowman. Education Morris received formal education from the University of Colorado in Boulder where he received his B.A. in Psychology in 1914 and his Master's in 1916. In 1917, attended Columbia University but had to leave prior to receiving his doctorate. He also earned several honors. In 1931 the University of Colorado awarded him the Norlin Medal, and then in 1942 he received an honorary Doctor of Science degree. In 1953, Morris was awarded the Alfred Vincent Kidder Award for excellence in the fields of Southwestern and Mesoamerican archaeology. Archaeological Fieldwork and Publications Aside from the influence of his father, Morris's archaeological activity began in earnest after meeting Edgar L. Hewett on a train in 1912. Later that year, he began his first field excavation in the La Plata district of Southwestern Colorado. In 1912 he also worked at Quirigua, Guatemala, where he returned for additional work in 1914. After his studies, Morris returned to Aztec Ruins in 1917 as a representative of the American Natural History Museum to explore the historic pueblo. In 1924, Morris worked for the Carnegie Institution of Washington and spent the next five years excavating at Chichen Itza, Yucat√°n. Morris‚Äôs first wife Ann Axtell Morris was critical to his research. She traveled in tandem with him and other notable figures in archaeology throughout the Southwest United States and Mexico with support from the Carnegie Institution to conduct fieldwork in the 1920s and 1930s. Among the many projects she was a part of, Ann was an important addition to the task of documenting and reconstructing the Temple of the Warriors in Chichen Itza. Earl Morris led a number of excavations in the field from 1916 to 1940 for the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU), the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the School of American Archaeology (SAA). The plethora of archaeological investigations he participated in lead to the production of 69 publications in the period of 1911-1956 and to the accumulation of extensive museum collections of pottery, stone implements, baskets, sandals, and related materials at the institutions for which he worked. As a prominent member of the archaeological community, Morris corresponded and collaborated with influential archaeologists, anthropologists, and other scientists of his time including Nels Nelson, A. V. Kidder, Jesse Nusbaum, Walter Fewkes, Edgar Hewett, Clark Wissler, A. E. Douglass, Junius Henderson, and Sylvanus G. Morley. Legacy The contributions of Earl Morris to the field of North American archaeology includes vast collections of artifacts as well as archives of his personal and professional notes, correspondence, and publication materials. These materials are currently housed at several institutions, but a large proportion of them are curated with the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History (CUMNH) and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Of note, the CUMNH collections of objects collected by Morris are accompanied by the Earl H. Morris Archive, which contains a variety of documents and photographs that came from his fieldwork and research, that continue to promote new research and foster interest in the past.

It is native to New Zealand, where it is a serious pest of apple trees and other fruit crops. The genus has also been reported from Fiji. Taxonomy The taxonomy of the genus is generally considered to be unresolved, as it is ambiguous how many species the genus contains. Fifteen species were described from New Zealand by Fabricius (1781), White (1846) and Broun (1880, 1893, 1909). In 1957, Shaw revised the genus, reducing the number of species in New Zealand to five (including two newly described species of his own). However, later entomologists ignored Shaw's synonymy. In the same year, two species of the genus were described from Fiji by Bryant and Gressitt. In 2015, using morphological and genetic evidence, several researchers proposed instead just three lineages (or putative species) of the genus in the mainland of New Zealand, using the names \\"Eucolaspis puncticollis\\", \\"Eucolaspis picticornis\\" and \\"Eucolaspis jucunda\\". However, in 2019, Spanish entomologist Jes√∫s G√≥mez- Zurita analysed the diversity and distribution of the genus, and his observations generally agreed with the conclusions of Shaw's 1957 revision, identifying at least five species of Eucolaspis in New Zealand. In addition, he described a new species, Eucolaspis kotatou, from Te Paki, near Cape Reinga.

She is currently a member of the idol group Tokiwoikiru („Éà„Ç≠„É≤„Ç§„Ç≠„É´).  Idol career  Maki Itoh made her debut in show business as part of the second generation of LinQ members, officially joining the group on February 11, 2012. She was placed in the group's Qty team. As a LinQ member, her first experience with professional wrestling was in 2013, when she was invited by president Sanshiro Takagi to participate in an \\"Idol Lumberjack 4 Way Match\\" at a DDT Pro-Wrestling show in Ryogoku Kokugikan. In the same year, she played a supporting role in the two-part thriller film ADA. In 2014 she was selected as a finalist in the Kodansha alternative beauty pageant, Miss iD, and although she was not selected for the main prize, she received a special prize given to her personally by television producer Nobuyuki Sakuma. Her participation in Miss iD led to her being featured on the song Heisei Shibou Yuugi by the band Urbangarde. In the same year, she also participated in the 6th anniversary show of Kyushu Pro Wrestling, \\"Kinniku Yamakasa '14\\", where she was the official second for Gabaiji-chan. In 2015, Itoh played a role in the horror film Obakeyashiki Retsuden: Senritsu Meikyuu MAX alongside fellow LinQ members Yusa Sugimoto and Kana Fukuyama. She also played a main role in the short film Inochi no Tokei, written and soundtracked by LinQ member Manami Sakura and featuring a cast made exclusively of the group's members. She appeared on the variety show God Tongue in June, drawing attention from the show's hosts due to the size of her head. In 2016, Itoh played herself in the film Minna Suitouto („Åø„Çì„Å™Â•Ω„ÅÑ„Å®„ÅÜ„Å®), a fictional movie based on LinQ and featuring the group's songs. LinQ were signed to the major label Avex later that year. In August she appeared on Masahiro Nakai's talk show Nakai no Mado, in a special episode featuring \\"people with unfortunate faces\\". In 2017, it was announced that the lineup of LinQ would be rearranged, and that a number of members would leave the group. Those members who were removed from LinQ would be featured in a new group focused on musical theater, but only if LinQ could sell 1,000 tickets to concerts held in Tokyo's Nakano Sun Plaza and the Fukuoka Civic Hall. Itoh personally performed wrestling and music on the streets in order to sell the tickets and promote the group, and they succeeded in meeting the requirements. However, on June 19, 2017, Itoh was removed from the group's lineup along with 6 other members, who were moved into the \\"entertainment group\\" Tokiwoikiru. Her response to being dismissed caused \\"Maki Itoh\\" to become the #1 Twitter trend in Japan at the time. After her removal from LinQ, Itoh turned her wrestling tag team with regular partner Mizuki, , into an idol group. The pair released their first CD single, Setsunairo, on January 4, 2018. Upon successfully selling 400 CDs, a music video was produced for the lead track. The group appeared together on internet variety show The Night with host Mari Yaguchi, where they performed Setsunairo and demonstrated wrestling moves live in the studio. Itoh performed her first show as a solo idol at Tokyo Idol Festival 2018: Other Recommend Live, a battle of the bands-style concert where idols nominated by judges compete for a spot at the prestigious Tokyo Idol Festival main event. Nominated by writer Go Yoshida, Itoh performed Setsunairo twice, along with an impromptu a cappella cover of nerve by BiS. Although she did not make it through as a musical performer, she later appeared as a part of the DDT Street Wrestling show held at the festival. In 2019, on July 22, Itoh released the digital single Brooklyn The Hole, a solo recording of a song originally performed by Tokiwoikiru, which she currently uses as her wrestling entrance theme.  Professional wrestling career  =DDT Pro-Wrestling appearances (2013-2016)= From 2013 to 2016, Itoh made sporadic appearances at DDT Pro- Wrestling shows. On December 15, 2013, at the \\"World Third Total Hakata\\" event, she teamed with Danshoku Dino and Makoto Oishi in a two-on-three handicap match, where they defeated Sanshiro Takagi and Toru Owashi. On December 13, 2015, at \\"Super Star Lanes 2015\\", Itoh took part in a battle royal for the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship, where she was the first eliminated. =Tokyo Joshi Pro Wrestling (2016-present)= On December 11, 2016, at the DDT Pro-Wrestling event \\"Road to SUPER SAND-Dramatic Dream Tonkotsu-\\" in Fukuoka Hakata Star Lane, Itoh made her official DDT debut, where she was defeated by Miyu Yamashita. On January 4, 2017, Itoh officially joined Tokyo Joshi Pro Wrestling. On March 13, 2017 at At This Time, Get Excited In Nerima! Itoh was defeated by Mil Clown in a three-way match also featuring Maho Kurone. After her dismissal from the idol group LinQ, Itoh stopped using the group's song Calorie Nante as her entrance theme, instead choosing to perform an on-the-spot a cappella version of the Noriyuki Makihara song Mou Koi Nante Shinai. This continued until the beginning of October 2017, when she began entering to Setsunairo by Tokiwoikiru. In July, Itoh participated in the \\"Tokyo Princess Cup\\" held at Shinjuku Mura Studio. In the first round, she fought against Shoko Nakajima, but was eliminated. Maki made her US debut at DDT Coming to America where she wrestled Miyu Yamashita. The next day she appeared at Joey Ryan's Penis Party event organized by Joey Ryan where she fought in a multi-man match for the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship, but was defeated by the champion Yoshihiko. In 2019, Itoh's long-standing tag team with her partner Mizuki, Itoh Respect Army, was officially disbanded after a singles match between the two. Itoh later recruited British wrestler Chris Brookes to replace Mizuki, renaming the team to \\"NEO Itoh Respect Army\\". After leaving his tour of Japan and returning to the United Kingdom, Brookes continued to represent the NEO Itoh Respect Army by wearing the team's official T-shirt and using Itoh's trademark kokeshi headbutt during shows. Itoh and Brookes had their first match as a tag team on November 3 at DDT's Ultimate Party 2019.

After its foundation on October 1, 1829, the South African Athenaeum (also known as the South African College and the forerunner of the UCT as well as the South African College Schools secondary and primary institutions) was for a while housed in a winery at the end of Long Street. This unsatisfactory situation continued until the late 1830s, when Governor Sir Benjamin D'Urban granted a plot of land to the school that had once housed a zoo at the end of Government Avenue in Company's Garden for use while a new building was constructed. The land could be accessed from Government Avenue through Leeuepoort, built by Louis Michel Thibault and Anton Anreith. The college English professor, James Constantine Adamson, made a rough sketch of the building in the then-popular Egyptian Revival architecture style. Col. G.G. Lewis of the Royal Engineers adopted the proposal and expanded on it once finished with the old military hospital. When construction began on the new building, the site was still surrounded by the abandoned cages that once held animals for Capetonians' entertainment. It had apparently broken down by the time Prof. Adamson opened the college on April 13, 1841. The construction cost ¬£3,000, but the new building was a major improvement on the cramped conditions on Long Street.  Bibliography  * (nl) Dreyer, Rev. Andries. 1910.

His other art names included H≈çsh≈´ (Ëì¨Ê¥≤), Senkan (ÂÉäË¶≥) and Hassend≈ç (ÂÖ´‰ªôÂ†Ç).  Life and work  His father was a pharmacist and he may have been of at least partial Chinese descent. As a young man, he moved to Ky≈çto, where he studied painting with artists of the Kan≈ç School and learned how to write haiku. Soon, however, he turned to Chinese painting; especially from the Yuan and Ming dynasties, becoming one of the earliest practitioners of the nanga style. As with many of the early nanga artists, his works were of variable quality. He also painted in the Yamato-e style and produced haiga (paintings associated with haiku writing). Another influence on his work were the landscapes known as \\"Shinkei\\" (ÁúüÊôØ; roughly, \\"True View\\"), that depicted actual places. Many of his compositions include elements incorporated directly from Chinese paintings, offering a record of specific influences derived from China. He was awarded the honorary title of \\"Hokky≈ç\\" (Ê≥ïÊ©ã; \\"Bridge of the Law\\"), which was given to artists who practiced Buddhism, and was one of the few nanga painters to earn a living entirely from his art. Some of his best known works are the \\"Screen with Landscapes\\" (Â±±Ê∞¥Âõ≥Â±èÈ¢®, which has been designated an Important Cultural Property), and a screen called \\"Plums and Bamboo\\" (Ê¢ÖÁ´πÂõ≥).

Red Canal () was an eighteenth-century waterway in Saint Petersburg. Built between 1711 and 1719, it was part of a series of canals dug to improve the drainage of the marshy areas of the city. The canal was one of two connecting the Moyka River and the Neva River in the area of what is now the Field of Mars. Opened in the presence of Peter the Great and Tsarina Catherine in 1719, the canal became a popular site for the nobility to construct large townhouses. By the 1770s the canal was no longer required for its original purpose, and with the expansion of buildings across the Neva embankment, the canal was filled in. A stone bridge built over the canal in 1768 was transferred to the Winter Canal, and survives today as the First Winter Bridge. History Digging of the canal began in 1711, running between the Moyka River and the Neva River for the purpose of draining the surrounding marshy areas. It was one of two canals dug in the area between 1711 and 1721. The other, later known as the Swan Canal, was dug parallel to the Red Canal along a shallow swampy river called the Lebedinka (). Together the two canals created an island, enclosing a roughly rectangular parcel of land, initially called simply Pustoi (), meaning \\"Empty\\" - after the trees that grew here were felled, and from the 1720s, the \\"Great Meadow\\" (), and in the present, the Field of Mars. The Red Canal was officially opened on 21 October 1719, in the presence of Peter the Great and Tsarina Catherine. During its early years the canal was spanned by a wooden drawbridge. From 1738 it became known as the Red Canal, after the nearby Red Bridge, now Theatre Bridge and part of the Tripartite Bridge across the Moyka. There was a small canal basin in the area of what is now Millionnaya Street. The second post house in the city was built close to the Red Canal's junction with the Neva in 1715, but burned down in 1735. With the completion of the Red Canal, the western edge of the Big Meadow became a popular site for the nobility to construct large townhouses. Those that settled in the area included Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, Alexander Rumyantsev, Adam Veyde, and Pavel Yaguzhinsky, and Peter the Great's daughter, Elizabeth Petrovna. In 1768, a single-span stone arched bridge was built to carry Bolshaya Nemetskaya Street, now Millionnaya Street, over the canal. The bridge was designed by Yury Felten and I. G. Rossi, with its construction supervised by engineer T. I. Nasonov. The First Winter Bridge, formerly a crossing on the Red Canal Antonio Rinaldi's Marble Palace was built to the west of the Red Canal between 1768 and 1785, with work beginning on the palace's service wing in the 1780 to a design by . Rinaldi had separated the palace's main building from the canal by means of a decorative wall, but the canal crossed the proposed site of the service wing. With the canal no longer necessary for drainage purposes, it was filled in in the late 1770s to allow the construction of the wing to begin. With the filling of the canal, the meadow ceased to be an island. The stone bridge crossing the former canal was dismantled between 1783 and 1784 and delivered in pieces to the nearby Winter Canal, where it was rebuilt. It survives today as the First Winter Bridge.

The conflict ended with a treaty of friendship, which delimited the border between Ethiopia and Italian Eritrea but contained clauses whose different interpretations led to another Italo-Ethiopian war. As the Mahdist uprising in the Sudan spilled over the frontier, Ethiopia was faced with a two-front war. The Emperor Yohannes IV also had to face internal resistance from his powerful vassals. King Menelik of Shewa even signed a treaty of neutrality with Italy in October 1887. While there is universal agreement that the war began in January 1887, historians differ about when it ended. Some limit the war to 1887, others extend it down to the Treaty of Wuchale in 1889, and others combine it with the Italo-Ethiopian War of 1895‚Äì96 and treat a single conflict as occurring from 1887 until 1896. The naming of the conflict also varies. It may be called the First Italo-Ethiopian War and the war of 1895‚Äì96 as the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Otherwise it may be identified solely by date. Italian historiography tends to group together all the fighting from 1885 until 1896. The original name for the fighting was Guerra d'Africa (African War), a term which indicates the broad perceived scope of early Italian colonial ambitions. As the Italian historian Giuseppe Finaldi puts it, \\"The war is called the Guerra d'Africa, not the Guerra d'Eritrea or such like.\\" Background The first Italian colony in what was to become the colony of Eritrea was Assab Bay, purchased by Giuseppe Sapeto on behalf of the Societ√† di Navigazione Rubattino (Rubattino Shipping Company) on 15 November 1869 from the brothers Ibrahim and Hassan Ben Ahmed for 6,000 Maria Theresa thalers. The Suez Canal opened two days later. The deal was later finalised for 8,350 thalers and with the Sultan Abd Allah Sahim as a party. On 11 March 1870, Sapeto purchased the Bay of Buya from the same brothers and sultan. Between 15 April 1870 and December 1879, however, Assab went unused by the company. The company offered it to the Italian government, which on 5 July 1882 passed a law making it Italy's first colony. The outbreak of the Mahdist uprising changed the political situation in the Horn of Africa. Egypt was unable to maintain its garrison in Massawa and, with British approval, an Italian Corpo Speciale per l'Africa (Special Corps for Africa), commanded by Colonel Tancredi Saletta, occupied it on 5 February 1885. Campaign =Dogali campaign= Italian moves into the hinterland of Massawa, territory claimed by Ethiopia, brought her forces into conflict with those of Ethiopia, specifically those of Ras Alula, governor of Mareb Mellash. On 24 or 25 January 1887, Alula attacked the Italian fort at Sahati. In the ensuing skirmish, his troops were beaten back. On 26 January, an Ethiopian force of about 15,000 men ambushed an Italian battalion sent to reinforce Sahati and almost annihilated it at Dogali, west of Massawa. The battle of Dogali turned out to be one of the most important in the history of modern Ethiopia. Alula did not follow up his victory, preferring to wait for permission from Yohannes to continue. He entered Asmara on 31 January 1887. The response to Dogali in Italy was immediate. The Italian parliament voted 5,000,000 lire for troops to reinforce Massawa. An Italian force was sent to garrison the interior, while Yohannes IV withdrew his forces to avoid confrontation. Disease ravaged the Italian troops and they were pulled out in March 1887, ending the first phase of the war. Following his victory, Alula remained in contact with the Italians regarding prisoners. He also subjected Massawa to a landward blockade in an effort to completely cut off its trade with the hinterland. This angered the local Muslim traders, whose sympathies shift towards the Italians. In his attack on Sahati, Alula had acted entirely on his own initiative. The Emperor Yohannes was at Makelle during the battle of Dogali. When Alula requested permission to expel the Italians from Massawa, the emperor is said to have castigated him for making war without permission: \\"Who gave you permission to go and make war there? Those soldiers are not yours but mine; I shall cut off your hand.\\" In late March, Yohannes summoned Alula to Makelle, where he was more conciliatory He promised the ras reinforcements against any Italian counterattack but forbade offensive operations. =Italian reinforcements and alliance with Shewa= On 2 June 1887, the Italian parliament voted a further 200,000,000 lire for troops, ammunition and supplies to be sent to Massawa. During the summer, an expeditionary force of 20,000 men was assembled in Italy. It landed in Massawa during November. With Yohannes weakened, Menelik of Shewa and King Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam entered into an alliance against him. In retaliation, the emperor crossed into Gojjam in early August 1887 and devastated it. The following month, he ordered Menelik to bar communications with Assab through Aussa. In response, Menelik sent letters to both the emperor and the Italians offering to mediate, as he had done after Dogali. Already in late August 1887, Menelik had received the Italian diplomat Pietro Antonelli in Shewa to negotiate an alliance against Yohannes. Italy requested a small piece of territory in the interior in which to garrison their troops during the summer. Antonelli also gave Menelik Italy's justifications for a punitive expedition to avenge Dogali. On 19 September, Antonelli proposed a treaty of neutrality with Shewa in exchange for munitions. A draft of this treaty survives. Nevertheless, in early October 1887, Yohannes wrote to Matewos, bishop of Shewa, who was with the Shewan court at Mount Entoto, that he was determined to go to war against Italy. On 20 October 1887, however, Menelik signed a secret treaty with Antonelli guaranteeing his neutrality in return for arms. Within six months he was to receive 5,000 Remington rifles. In the treaty, Italy renounced any intention of annexing Ethiopian territory. =Campaign of Ras Alula= In September 1887, Alula invaded Damot with a Tigrayan army. With their ras away, the Tigrayan chiefs made contact with the Italians. On 11 November 1887, Gerald Portal, the British consul at Cairo, met Alula at Asmara. He then met Yohannes encamped by Lake Ashangi on 7 December. He conveyed to the emperor his government's opinion that the attack on Sahati had been \\"unjust\\" and urged that Alula be removed as governor of Mareb Mellash. Yohannes refused to concede anything to the Italians: \\"If they cannot live there [at Massawa] without Sahati, let them go.\\" He also defended Ras Alula, saying that \\"[he] did no wrong; the Italians came into the province under his governorship and he fought them, just as you [the British] would fight the Abyssinians [Ethiopians] if they came to England.\\" By January 1888, the Italians had moved two brigades up to Dogali. Yohannes mobilised for war. In December 1887, he had ordered Menelik to guard Wollo and Begemder, while Ras Mikael brought up 25,000 Oromo cavalry to Tigray. Facing a Mahdist invasion in the west, Yohannes abandoned his campaign in March. Paul Henze suggests that \\"personal antipathy to Islam and desire to see the Mahdist rebellion contained must ... have carried weight in his decision to give priority to the war against the Mahdists over defense against Italian encroachment.\\" In February‚ÄìMarch 1888 Menelik, on Yohannes' orders, marched his army west to Gondar to defend it from the Mahdists. He did not arrive in time and Gondar was sacked. With Yohannes out of the fighting against Italy, Alula withdrew to Asmara in early April 1888 and retreated to Adwa on 23 April. Although Asmara was left undefended, the Italians did not move on it. In May 1888, the Italian expeditionary force in the north withdrew, having never progressed far from the coast. The rifles promised to Menelik in the treaty of October arrived in Assab that same month, but were withheld. In order to free up the weapons, Menelik signed a second treaty with Antonelli in early July 1888. He also made an alliance Tekle Haymanot against Yohannes, who ravaged Gojjam in early August. The emperor was joined by Alula in September. The Italian then supplied the promised arms to Menelik in case the emperor followed through on his threat to invade Shewa. With Ethiopia on the verge of civil war, the Italians occupied Keren on 6 February 1889. Dejazmach Dabbab Araya, governor of Akele Guzay, occupied Asmara on 9 February 1889 on his own initiative. Treaty of Wuchale In the vacuum that followed the death of Yohannes IV in the Battle of Gallabat against the Mahdists on 10/11 March 1889, General Oreste Baratieri occupied the highlands along the Eritrean coast and Italy proclaimed the establishment of the new colony of Italian Eritrea. The Italian possession of maritime areas previously claimed by Ethiopia was formalized on 2 May 1889 with the signing of the Treaty of Wuchale with the new emperor, Menelik of Shewa. It was a compromise: while Ethiopia had been successful in the field, the Italians had managed to occupy territory and retreat in an orderly way. They retained their acquisitions on the Red Sea. Menelik recognized the Italian occupation of his rivals' lands of Bogos, Hamasien, Akkele Guzay and Serae in exchange for guarantees of financial assistance and continuing access to European arms and ammunition. Casualties Both sides had taken large losses. Sources about the Italian casualties reported 430 killed at Dogali and 1,000 in other battles, while the Ethiopians suffered perhaps as little as 730 killed at Dogali and 400 in other battles.

A Militia unit, the battalion was originally formed as a light horse regiment in 1918. Through the 20th Light Horse Regiment, the unit drew lineage back to early Victorian colonial forces, raised in 1885. During the early part of World War II, the unit was converted from a light horse regiment to a motorised unit ‚Äì the 20th Motor Regiment ‚Äì and undertook defensive duties in Victoria and then Queensland. In 1944, it deployed in a dismounted role to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea, to defend the Allied airfield that had been constructed there. The unit was later converted into a pioneer battalion in early 1945, deploying to New Guinea in the final stages of the war. It was disbanded in November 1945. History A unit of the part-time Militia, the battalion was formed as a pioneer unit in February 1945, when it was converted from the 20th Motor Regiment. The unit's lineage was convoluted. Having been converted from the 20th Motor Regiment, it traced its lineage through the 20th Light Horse Regiment (Victorian Mounted Rifles), which had been formed in 1918. This unit had evolved from the 15th Light Horse Regiment (Victorian Mounted Rifles), which had been formed in 1912 from the 7th Australian Light Horse (Victorian Mounted Rifles). The 7th had been raised in 1902 from the Victorian volunteer forces which had previously contributed personnel to contingents deployed by the state as part of the Imperial Bushmen to the Second Boer War. Lineage was also claimed to early Victorian colonial forces, which adopted the designation of the Victorian Mounted Rifles when raised in 1885. These units had been assigned to the 3rd and 5th Light Horse Brigades before World War I. During the war, the regiment provided manpower to several First Australian Imperial Force light horse regiments, including the 4th, 8th and 13th, but did not deploy as a formed body. The 4th and 8th Light Horse Regiments served in the Gallipoli Campaign, in Egypt, and in the Sinai and Palestine campaign in 1915‚Äì1918, while the 13th served on the Western Front. In 1921, the Australian Army was reorganised following the demobilisation of the wartime forces, and the 20th Light Horse Regiment was assigned to the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, as a part-time unit based in Victoria. During the interwar years, the 20th Light Horse Regiment maintained depots in Seymour, Shepparton, Tatura, Melbourne, Yea, Mansfield, Alexandra, Numurkah, Broadford, Tocumwal, Finley and Nathalia, and formed part of the 2nd Cavalry Division. In the early part of World War II, the 20th Light Horse Regiment drew personnel from the Murray River region of Victoria, and in December 1941 was mobilised for full time service. They were converted into a motor regiment around this time, while based at Torquay. Assigned a defensive role to protect Melbourne in the event of an invasion, they were tasked with securing landing beaches around Barwon Heads and Anglesea. In early 1942, the regiment handed over its positions to the 23rd/21st Infantry Battalion, and moved to Colac, as it was re-orientated towards the defence of Geelong. In April 1942, the 20th Motor Regiment was sent to Puckapunyal and was assigned to the 2nd Armoured Brigade, to complete its establishment. Collective training with the rest of the 1st Armoured Division took place in Wee Waa, New South Wales, in August; however, a reorganisation followed which resulted in the 20th Motor Regiment being transferred to the 2nd Motor Brigade, within the 2nd Armoured Division. Concentrating at Wallgrove, New South Wales, in February 1943, the brigade prepared to move to Victoria; however, the 20th Motor Regiment was diverted to Murgon, Queensland, rejoining the 2nd Armoured Brigade as it was decided that the 2nd Armoured Division was to be disbanded. Throughout 1943 and 1944, Australia's armoured forces were reduced as manpower requirements elsewhere resulted in the disbandment of many units. Nevertheless, in early 1944, the 20th Motor Regiment was chosen to deploy to Dutch New Guinea to undertake a defensive role as a dismounted motorised infantry regiment. In February 1944, the regiment arrived at Merauke, replacing the 62nd Infantry Battalion within Merauke Force. In this role, it was assigned to defend the airfield from a potential Japanese attack aimed at the Allied western flank. However, the fighting in New Guinea and elsewhere in the Pacific in 1943‚Äì1944 had pushed the Japanese back, and the threat to Merauke had diminished. As a result, throughout 1944 the garrison there was slowly reduced. In February 1945, the 20th Motor Regiment embarked for Australia, and moved to Glenfield, New South Wales. After a period of leave, the unit was converted into a pioneer battalion. Four companies were raised. Of these, No. 3 Pioneer Company served in the Territory of New Guinea before the end of the war. The remaining companies were assigned to relieve the 4th Infantry Battalion at Madang. The battalion was disbanded on 15 November 1945. In the post war period, the unit was perpetuated by the 8th/13th Victorian Mounted Rifles, which remained on the order of battle until the early 1990s when it was merged with the 4th/19th Prince of Wales's Light Horse. The unit's guidon was entrusted to the 8th/13th during this period. Battle honours The unit held the following battle honours: * South Africa 1899‚Äì1902 * Anzac, Gallipoli 1915, Egypt 1915‚Äì17, Palestine 1917‚Äì18 * South West Pacific Area 1944‚Äì45 Of these, all but the last battle honour was inherited.

He was also an alderman and Chief Magistrate of the town. Background Vachell's father had been a naval surgeon and came to Cardiff when Charles was a small child. Vachell senior opened a chemist's shop in Duke Street in 1790. Charles later took over the running of the chemist's shop, subsequently opening an ironmongers next door. Vachell was a Wesleyan and a teetotaller. He married and had six sons and one daughter. Charles Street Vachell's businesses were successful, allowing him to retire and hand over the businesses in 1849. He invested his money in property and land in Cardiff. Some of his land was used for the creation of one of the town's most well-to- do streets, which became known as Charles Street, named after him. In March 1849, when planning Cardiff's new drainage, Charles Street was described as the town's \\"principal street\\" (though Vachell, being a member of the street commissioners, was criticised for having a conflict of interest). Politics and public service Vachell was one of the original town councillors to Cardiff Town Council when it was created in December 1835. He was elected as Mayor of Cardiff in 1848 and again in 1855. He was also elected as Cardiff's Chief Magistrate. His first period as mayor was marked by his campaign against all forms of gambling in public houses. Vachell represented Cardiff at the Lord Mayor of York's dinner, where the principal mayors of the United Kingdom mayors were represented. During both of his periods in office, as a teetotaller, he refused to grant any additional pub licenses in the town. Vachell was a notable supporter of the poor and dispossessed. He was a Guardian of the Poor for the parish of St John and a vice president of Cardiff's Infirmary. During Vachell's second period as mayor he established a 'Poor Box' in the Police Court to collect money for those in need (though this was discontinued as soon as his period in office ended). Vachell was elected as an alderman in January 1855. By 1859 Vachell was one of only three councillors to have been founding members of the council. Death Morgan died at his house in Crockherbtown, Cardiff, on 19 January 1859, after being in failing health for several months. He was 75 years old. He had a private funeral seven days later. Three of his sons continued in business in Cardiff, while two others moved away. His widow and a son continued to live in his substantial Crockerbtown house. Vachell's eldest son, Dr Charles Redwood Vachell, became a popular town physician as well as a town councillor, though died only a few years after his father in 1865.

It supersedes the XJ (X351), the last example of which was built in July 2019. Overview On 5 July 2019, the last day of production of their XJ (X351) car at their Castle Bromwich site, Jaguar Land Rover confirmed that they intend to build its replacement, an all-electric luxury saloon car, at the same plant. The car is expected to be launched in 2020. According to The Verge, the new model was being \\"developed by the same team that created the I-Pace\\" and JLR planned to make a \\"new range\\" of electrified vehicles at the plant in future but had not released additional specifics as of 5 July 2019. The Castle Bromwich plant is to be updated to produce the car on the company's new Modular Longitudinal Architecture (MLA). The plan to build the electric Jaguar XJ saloon, replacing the manufacturing of the conventional XJ at this plant, was essential for \\"safeguarding the jobs of 2,500 people\\" (or 2,700 people, according to BBC News). Manufacturing of the new model was expected to start in autumn 2019, after a significant investment in upgrades to the facility.

The fleet was created in 1720 when the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, became the King of Sardinia. Victor Amadeus had acquired the vessels be used to establish the fleet while he was still the King of Sicily in 1713. The Sardinian Navy saw action in a number of conflicts, including the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars from the 1790s to 1810s, limited actions against the Barbary Coast such as the Battle of Tripoli in 1825, and the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859. The last war was a major step toward Italian unification, which led to the creation of a united Italian state in 1861. During the fighting in 1860, the Royal Neapolitan Navy defected to Sardinia and placed itself under Sardinian control; in 1861, the navy also absorbed the Royal Sicilian Navy, resulting in the creation of the Regia Marina (Royal Navy), which itself became the Marina Militare, the modern Italian navy, in 1946. History =Creation and expansion= The frigate during a South America cruise, done in 1838 The fleet traced its origins to the rule of Victor Amadeus II in the early 18th century, who as Duke of Savoy became the King of Sardinia in 1720. Prior to 1713, Victor Amadeus had no navy. As duke he relied on the one or two galleys and smaller vessels belonging the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and on ducal letters of marque authorizing privateers to operate out of his main ports, Nice and Oneglia. When in 1703, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Emperor Charles VI first proposed that the Duke of Savoy should receive the Kingdom of Sardinia, Victor Amadeus rejected the proposal on the grounds that he had no navy with which to defend the island. In 1713, however, Victor Amadeus acquired the Kingdom of Sicily and with it a squadron of galleys. He issued orders that the squadron should be maintained at five galleys and three other vessels. He created a marine corps and in 1717 promulgated fleet regulations. In 1718, Spain conquered Sicily during the War of the Quadruple Alliance and captured the Savoyard fleet. Victor Amadeus was forced to rely on privateers for the duration of the conflict, but when he gave up Sicily in exchange for Sardinia in 1720 he also received back his fleet. Throughout its existence, the Sardinian fleet was small compared to the fleets of the Great Powers. The kingdom was a small country with a limited budget; it was also surrounded by potentially hostile states, most significantly France and the Austrian Empire, which placed greater demand for spending on the Royal Sardinian Army than for the navy. During the 18th century, the fleet took part in a series of wars against the Ottoman Empire, the states of the Barbary Coast, and Spain, the latter in the War of Jenkins' Ear. During that conflict, Sardinia allied itself to the Kingdom of Great Britain after Spanish troops tried to force their way through Sardinian Piedmont in 1742; the small Sardinian fleet of galleys was placed under the command of the British Mediterranean Fleet. The shallow-draft vessels could be used close to shore, where the larger British warships could not easily maneuver, though their small size rendered them vulnerable to bad weather, which kept them from operating through the winter. In the 1790s, Sardinia was a member of the coalitions arrayed against Republican France in the French Revolutionary Wars. Having been defeated by Napoleon in his mainland possessions, King Charles Emmanuel IV abdicated and his son, Victor Emmanuel I, retreated to the island of Sardinia. Bankrupted and protected by the British Royal Navy, he allowed his navy to decline so that by 1809 it consisted of two xebecs, a galley and two half-galleys. In the Treaty of Vienna that ended the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the old Savoyard state was restored with the addition of the former Republic of Genoa. This acquisition gave Sardinia access to Genoa's superior shipbuilding facilities. By this time, the largest ship of the fleet was a 20-gun corvette. Victor Emmanuel embarked on a naval expansion program under the direction of Admiral Giorgio des Geneys, who ordered a series of warships from Italian and British shipyards. Giorgio des Geneys Victor Emmanuel did not remain on the throne to see the fruits of his program; revolution in 1821 forced him to abdicate in favor of his brother Charles Felix. During the revolt, the Austrian Navy mobilized ships to intervene in the conflict (which also involved the Neapolitan Kingdom of the Two Sicilies) and attack the Sardinian fleet, but by the time the Austrians arrived the revolt had ended. The Sardinian fleet saw action against the Barbary states twice in the 1820s; Geneys led a squadron to attack Morocco in 1822 that achieved little. Geneys ordered the fleet to attack the Vilayet of Tripoli in 1825, resulting in the Battle of Tripoli. The Sardinian success at Tripoli convinced Charles Felix to continue his predecessor's construction program, ordering a number of frigates, corvettes and sloops in the late 1820s. These included the 50-gun frigates and , the 60-gun frigates and , the 44-gun frigate , and the 20-gun corvette . By 1829, the fleet included a total of eight frigates. During this period, the fleet kept warships in the Levant to protect Sardinian interests in the region during the Greek War of Independence, but they saw little activity. Naval expenditure fell significantly after Charles' death in 1831, as his successor, Charles Albert, was not interested in naval matters. In the 1830s, the fleet sent its warships abroad, frequently to South American waters, to protect Sardinian economic interests in the region. In 1833, Sardinia signed an alliance with the Neapolitans, and that year, the two countries sent a combined squadron of three Sardinian and one Neapolitan frigates to attack Tunis. The squadron forced the city to pay compensation for attacks on Italian merchant vessels. Naval construction continued apace and in 1834, the fleet acquired its first steam warship, the sloop , powered by a British-built steam engine. The 24-gun corvette was launched in 1838, followed by the paddle corvette in 1840 and the next year saw the launch of the 18-gun brig and the powerful 64-gun frigate ; the latter vessel carried the first shell-firing Paixhans guns of the Sardinian fleet. By 1847, the fleet included five paddle steamers. =Wars of Italian unification= First Italian War of Independence During the Revolutions of 1848, two divisions of warships were sent to the Adriatic Sea to support Venice's revolt against the Austrian Empire, supported by a division from the Royal Neapolitan Navy. The Italian states hoped that the revolution would lead to national unification. The small Austrian fleet that remained loyal (after the bulk of the fleet, crewed primarily be Venetians, rebelled) briefly blockaded Venice until the Sardinian‚ÄìNeapolitan fleet arrived. The ex-Austrian ships in Venice joined the Sardinian squadron consisting of three frigates, one brig, and one schooner, and the Neapolitan squadron to blockade Trieste, where the Austrian fleet had retreated. There, the Austrian ships were trapped, as the Italian forces outnumbered them two-to-one. But the Italian fleet was prevented from pressing the attack on the Austrian fleet, as Trieste was located in the part of Austria that was included in the German Confederation and the Frankfurt Parliament informed the Sardinians and Neapolitans that an attack on Trieste would be treated as an attack on the Confederation. The Neapolitans were withdrawn after a revolt toppled their government, prompting the Sardinians to send every available vessel of their fleet to reinforce the Italian squadron. By now, the Sardinian contingent consisted of four frigates, two corvettes, two brigs, and eight steamships, commanded by Vice Admiral Giuseppe Albini. Though strengthened by the reinforcements, the Italian fleet nevertheless was weakened by the Neapolitan withdrawal. Further threats from Frankfurt convinced the Sardinians to order Albini to drop the blockade and merely observe the port. Defeats on land, including the Battle of Custoza in July secured Austrian victory. The ensuing armistice signed by Austria and Sardinia that month forced the latter to withdraw its fleet, and Albini took his ships to Corfu. Following a rebellion in Austria, Albini returned to Venice in October to operate with a French squadron that was at that time passively obstructing the Austrian blockade of the city. He was forced to withdraw most of his ships to Ancona over the winter of 1848‚Äì1849 due to bad weather. Sardinia declared war again in March 1849, but the fleet could not deploy from Ancona to support Venice before the Sardinian army was defeated again at the Battle of Novara in March, forcing the country out of the war a second time. The second armistice required the Sardinian fleet to leave the Adriatic within fifteen days. During the conflict, the ships of the Sardinian fleet were marred by repeated acts of insubordination and poor discipline. Crimean War and the Second Italian War of Independence The steam frigate under the Italian flag in 1861 The appointment of Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour as the Sardinian naval minister in 1850 marked another period of reorganization and construction; he restored discipline in the ships' crews and improved the technical quality of the fleet. He ordered the steam frigate from Britain, which was commissioned in 1854. She was the first screw-driven warship of the Sardinian fleet. Three more frigates followed later in the 1850s, including , , and . In 1860, Cavour added a pair of small ironclad warships, the , beginning a series of ironclads built for the Sardinian and later Italian ; these ships started a naval arms race with Austria, the traditional opponent of the Italian states. To ensure better discipline and aggressiveness in its officer corps, Cavour worked to instill strong nationalist sentiment in the Sardinian naval academy in Genoa. Cavour's tenure as naval minister was marked by a more aggressive foreign policy; Cavour also served as the Prime Minister of Sardinia. Under his direction the country joined the British and French during the Crimean War of 1853‚Äì1855, though the Sardinian contribution to the war was almost entirely on land; a small squadron consisting of Carlo Alberto and several paddle steamers were sent to support the expeditionary army. The war nevertheless provided an opportunity to seek closer ties with France and experience operating warships under wartime conditions. In 1859, he engineered the Second Italian War of Independence, a major step toward Italian unification, relying on a secret alliance with France to defeat the larger Austrian Empire. During the latter conflict, the Sardinian fleet operated with the French Navy against Austrian ships in the Adriatic. At that time, the Sardinian fleet consisted of two screw-driven frigates, four sail frigates, two sail corvettes, six brigs, and eight paddle steamers. The powerful French squadron, including six screw ships of the line and three ironclad floating batteries, compelled the Austrians to retreat to Pola. The two fleets began preparations for joint amphibious assaults on the Dalmatian coast of Austria, but victories on land at the Battles of Magenta and Solferino ended the war before the landings could be conducted. , the first Sardinian ironclad warship The Franco-Italian victory against Austria propelled the Italian states toward unification, and the decisive events began in late 1859 and into early 1860. The central Italian duchies, including Modena, Parma, and Romagna, voted to unite with Sardinia in August and September 1859 and attempts by Austria to create a conference of the Great Powers to prevent Italian unification broke down in January 1860. In March, Cavour returned to the naval ministry while also serving as prime minister. At the same time, Giuseppe Garibaldi led the Expedition of the Thousand to begin the conquest of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, supported by the Sardinians. At the time, the commander of the Sardinian fleet was Vice Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano; in April, the Tuscan fleet was added to the Sardinian navy, and in September, the Neapolitan fleet defected to Sardinian control. Persano sent a squadron into the Adriatic to support an attack on Ancona in mid-1860. Persano then used the fleet to blockade the port of Gaeta, the last major Neapolitan fortress; a French squadron initially blocked Persano from shelling the fortress in an attempt to control the conflict. But the French withdrew in January 1861, allowing a direct attack that forced the Neapolitans to surrender in February. The next month the Kingdom of Italy was created under the Sardinian king, Victor Emmanuel II. The Sardinian fleet provided the core of the unified , which was created through the combination of the Sardinian, Neapolitan, Sicilian and Tuscan navies; the new navy was formally created two weeks later. The Regia Marina itself became the Marina Militare, the current Italian navy, in 1946 following the country's defeat in World War II and the toppling of the monarchy. Structure in 1856 Ensign of the Sardinian Navy from 1851 to 1861 In 1856, the Sardinian Navy had a total strength of 2,860 men.

Formulated in 2005 as Cosmic Vision: Space Science for Europe 2015‚Äì2025, the campaign succeeded the Horizon 2000 Plus campaign and envisioned a number of missions in the fields of astronomy and solar system exploration beyond 2015. Ten missions across four funding categories are planned to be launched under Cosmic Vision, with the first being CHEOPS in December 2019. A mission to the Galilean moons, JUICE, the first deep space mission with an opportunistic target, Comet Interceptor, and one of the first gravitational-wave space observatories, LISA, are planned for launch as part of the Cosmic Vision campaign.  History  The initial call of ideas and concepts was launched in 2004 with a subsequent workshop held in Paris to define more fully the themes of the Vision under the broader headings of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Solar System Exploration and Fundamental Physics. By early 2006 the formulation for a 10-year plan based around 4 key questions emerged: * What are the conditions for planet formation and the emergence of life? * How does the Solar System work? * What are the fundamental physical laws of the Universe? * How did the Universe originate and what is it made of? In March 2007 a call for mission ideas was formally released, which yielded in 19 astrophysics, 12 fundamental physics and 19 Solar System mission proposals. In March 2012 ESA announced it had begun working on a series of small class (S-class) science missions. The first winning S-class concept is set to receive 50 million euros (¬£42m) and will be readied for launch in 2017. Missions =Small class= Small class missions (S-class) are intended to have a cost to ESA not exceeding 50 million euros. A first call for mission proposals was issued in March 2012. Approximately 70 letters of Intent were received. In October 2012 the first S-class mission was selected. The current list of S-class missions include the following: * S1, CHEOPS, to measure known exoplanets' size by photometry; launched on 18 December 2019. * S2, SMILE, a joint mission between ESA and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to study the interaction between Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind. Selected in June 2015 from thirteen competing proposals, its launch is planned for 2023. = Medium class = Medium class (M-class) projects are relatively stand-alone projects and have a price cap of approximately 500 million euros. The first two M-class missions, M1 and M2, were selected in October 2011: * M1, Solar Orbiter, a heliophysics mission to make close-up observations of the Sun; launched on 10 February 2020. * M2, Euclid, a visible to near-infrared space telescope to study dark energy and dark matter; launch planned for June 2022. * M3, PLATO, a mission to search for exoplanets and measure stellar oscillations. Selected on 19 February 2014, its launch is planned for 2026. Other competing concepts that were studied included EChO, LOFT, MarcoPolo-R, STE-QUEST, and Caroline.The proposed Caroline ESA M3 mission to a Main Belt Comet. Geraint H. Jones, etal. Advances in Space Research. volume 62, issue 8, pp 1921-1946. 15 October 2018. * M4, ARIEL (Atmospheric Remote-Sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey), a space observatory which will observe transits of nearby exoplanets to determine their chemical composition and physical conditions. The mission was selected by ESA on 20 March 2018 as fourth medium-class science mission, to be launched in mid-2028. After a preliminary culling of proposals in March 2015, a short list of three mission proposals selected for further study was announced on 4 June 2015. The shortlist included the following two proposals: THOR (Turbulence Heating ObserveR) which would address a fundamental problem in space plasma physics concerned with the heating of plasma and the subsequent dissipation of energy; and XIPE (X-ray Imaging Polarimetry Explorer) which would study X-ray emissions from high-energy sources such as supernovas, galaxy jets, black holes and neutron stars, to discover more about the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions. * A call for M5 mission proposals was announced in April 2016. In May 2018, a shortlist of three candidate missions was announced for a proposed launch date in 2032: SPICA (SPace Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics), a far-infrared observatory; THESEUS (Transient High-Energy Sky and Early Universe Surveyor), a space telescope to detect distant gamma-ray bursts; and EnVision, a Venus orbiter for radar mapping. In October 2020 it was announced that SPICA is no longer being considered as a candidate for the M5 mission. The final selection is planned for mid-2021. =Large class= Originally it was intended that Large class (L-class) projects were to be carried out in collaboration with other partners and should have an ESA cost not exceeding 900 million euros. However, in April 2011 it became clear that budget pressures in the US meant that an expected collaboration with NASA on the L1 mission would not be practical; so the down-selection was delayed and the missions re-scoped on the assumption of ESA lead with some limited international participation. Three L-class missions have been selected: * L1, JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer), a mission to the Jupiter system (with heritage from Laplace); launch planned for 2022. * L2, ATHENA (Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics), an X-ray observatory with a launch planned for 2031. * L3, LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), a space mission concept designed to detect and accurately measure gravitational waves at lower frequencies than Earth-bound detectors. Its launch is planned for 2034. =Fast class= At the ESA Science Programme Committee (SPC) Workshop on 16 May 2018, the creation of a series of special opportunity Fast class (F-class) missions was proposed. These F-missions would be jointly launched alongside each M-class mission starting from M4, and would focus on \\"innovative implementation\\" in order to broaden the range of scientific topics covered by the mission. The inclusion of F-class missions into the Cosmic Vision program would require a significant increase of the science budget, to be discussed in future meetings. In 2019, the first F-class mission was selected: * F1, Comet Interceptor, a mission to study a long-period comet or an interstellar object (which will be determined after the launch), launching as a secondary payload together with M4, ARIEL in 2028.  Missions of opportunity  Occasionally ESA makes contributions to space missions led by another space agency. These missions include: * Hinode ‚Äì X-ray space telescope leading by JAXA, launched in 2006; * IRIS ‚Äì solar space spectrograph leading by NASA, launched in 2013; * Microscope ‚Äì microsatellite for studying free fall leading by CNES, active in 2016‚Äì2018; * PROBA-3 ‚Äì space technology testing spacecraft, to be launched in 2022; * XRISM ‚Äì X-ray space telescope leading by JAXA, to be launched in 2022; * ExoMars - a series of Mars probes in collaboration with Roscosmos, an orbiter operational since 2017, a rover to be launched in 2022; * Einstein Probe ‚Äì a space mission dedicated to time-domain high-energy astrophysics leading by CAS, to be launched in 2022; * MMX ‚Äì a sample-return Mars' moons probe leading by JAXA, to be launched in 2024. A contribution to SPICA (Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics), a Japanese JAXA mission was evaluated as such a mission of opportunity within the Cosmic Vision. It is no longer considered within that framework, but is one of the mission proposals being considered for M5.

As a teenager he was caught distributing anti-government leaflets, and spent the final months of the National Socialist period serving the first part of a ten year prison sentence. Towards the end of 1945 he entered mainstream politics in his home region, which was by now being administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone. He campaigned against the contentious party merger between the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. A further lengthy period in government detention followed. In 1956, following high level government negotiations, he was released and unceremoniously transferred from East to West Berlin. After this he came to the notice of commentators as one of a handful of West German back-room negotiators involved in the \\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\" programme, which involved East German political prisoners being released to West Germany in return for large amounts of cash. When the programme began, in 1962, it was a jealously guarded government secret on both sides of the border between the Germanys. However, as more and more former East German political prisoners turned up in West Germany during the 1960s and 1970s, the realities of \\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\" became, little by little, a matter of public knowledge. By 1980, some of the complexities of Hermann Kreutzer's shadowy involvement in it were being openly discussed in the West German press. Biography =Provenance and early years= Hermann Kreutzer was born into a politicised family in Saalfeld, a small industrial town south of Erfurt and Weimar. Paul Kreutzer, his father, worked as a carpenter and as a master-glazier, and was a committed member of the Social Democratic Party. When Hermann Kreutzer was aged 8 the National Socialists took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Any sort of anti-government political activity became illegal and, for those who engaged in it, dangerous. A childhood experience young Hermann would never forget involved a visit to the family home from the security services. They ransacked the drawers and cupboards and, while they were at it, crushed his favourite toy car. As a teenager he took part in \\"leafleting actions\\", which involved distributing political material produced by or for the illegal SPD in Saalfeld. =The army= In 1942, Kreutzer was conscripted for military service and sent to serve in occupied France. Though opposed to Nazism, he was no pacifist. He had the self-confident bearing and the Aryan physique of a Prussian officer. Like Adolf Hitler, he idolized King Frederick the Great. When he acquired a nasty war wound, therefore, and was taken to a military hospital, he faced no questioning over the cause. In fact, the cause of his \\"war wound\\" was a large pot of boiling water which his father had poured over his leg. In order to ensure there would be no rapid recovery, Paul Kreutzer had completed the work on his son's leg by thoroughly contaminating the resulting skin burn. Other sources recall that while serving in France Hermann Kreutzer secretly maintained contact with the r√©sistance. At considerable personal risk, he would steal weapons from the military stores and hand them over to r√©sistance contacts. Elsewhere there are references to his having undertaken (equally dangerous) courier work for the r√©sistance. In March 1945, still aged only 17, he was arrested by the authorities, found guilty of \\"Wehrkraftzersetzung\\" (undermining the war effort), and sentenced to a ten year jail term. In the chaos of the final months of the Second World War he managed to escape. From somewhere he got hold of a set of civilian clothes and a bicycle. He returned to Saalfeld in the company of United States forces. Interviewed a year before his death Kreutzer would recall with satisfaction that he had managed to complete his escape and return home without a shot being fired. =Time to rebuild= By this time Kreutzner was 21. The region surrounding Saalfeld had been liberated by United States 2nd Infantry Division. The US military administration and their British allies gave Kreutzner his first post-war assignment. He was allocated responsibility for managing food distribution in four districts. In July 1945, the area was handed over to the Soviet administration as had been agreed at the Yalta Conference. From October 1949, the area became part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In July 1945, Kreutzer and his father, Paul, met Walter Ulbricht, who later, as General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, became East Germany's first leader. Ulbricht had returned to Germany from Moscow on 30 April 1945, with a group of other German exiles known as the Ulbricht Group. At their first meeting, Kreutzer and his father told Ulbricht of their plans to create a local League of Democratic Socialists. The Kreutzer's were co-opted as members of the Social Democratic Party regional executive. With others, they set up a Saalfeld branch of the party. =Political tensions in the Soviet occupation zone= Relations between the Kreutzers and the emerging Soviet-style communist establishment quickly deteriorated. The push for an unequal political merger between Communists and Social Democrats was already on display. Discussions were sometimes heated. In his 2006 interview, Kreutzer would recall receiving a friendly warning from another future East German leader at a Youth Seminar in Camburg. Erich Honecker of the Free German Youth told him, \\"If you carry on like this, you'll end up back in the jail\\". At the start of April 1946, Hermann Kreutzer and his father cycled over to Weimar in response to an invitation they had received to attend a lunch with other prominent politicians and activists. The invitation came from the Soviet military administrators in the region: lunch was to be served in the \\"officer's casino\\" at the Hotel Empress Augusta. Before the meal began, Kreutzer was able to inspect the long finely decorated table. The \\"Socis\\" (Social Democrats) were to sit along one side of it and the \\"Komiks\\" (comedians, as, among themselves, they called the Communists) were to sit along the other side. An unexpected feature of the way in which the room had been prepared had involved the positioning of a second chair behind each of the chairs set in place for the diners. When the guests sat down to eat, each man found himself with a Soviet officer sitting directly behind him. After the meal, the acting regional president of the Social Democrats, Heinrich Hoffmann, proposed a toast. He cited (if selectively) a rich tradition of pioneering Social Democratic progress in the Thuringia region, dating back to 1869. In light of this, it was no more than his duty to be the first, here in Thurinigia, to \\"proclaim the unity\\" (between Communists and Social Democrats). For Kreutzer and other Social Democrats present, Hoffman's action was an appalling betrayal, but as soon as Hoffmann sat down the Soviet general next to him stood up: \\"We wish to toast the unity\\". Several Social Democrats began to protest, but behind each of them a Soviet officer came to life and ordered them to \\"say nothing\\". On the other side of the table the communist lunch guests now stood up, as one, and sang a verse extolling party unity from the song (originally a poem by the revolutionary poet Leonid Petrowitsch Radin), \\"Brothers, towards the sunshine, towards freedom\\". As far as Thuringia was concerned, the formal unification of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party was enacted at nearby Gotha on 7 April 1946. Accordingly, the political unification did take place a couple of weeks earlier in Thuringia than in the rest of the Soviet occupation zone. \\"Nationally\\", the contentious merger took place at a special congress convened in Berlin on 21 April 1946. On 1 May 1946, Hermann Kreutzer and Doroth√©e \\"Dorle\\" Fischer attended the first political rally in Saalfeld of the new Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) in the main square at Saalfeld. The two of them had been friends since before the memorable occasion in 1933 when, aged 9 and 10, they had celebrated Hitler's successes by together discovering Kreutzer's uncle's wine collection. As the meeting in the square progressed, Dorle suggested the two of them should leave in case events turned ugly. But Kreutzner's opposition to National Socialism would never translate into opposition to military values of honour, courage and loyalty. He was loyal to the Social Democratic Party. So at night, with others, he now began to make his way through the streets of the town, sticking to the walls posters condemning the merger of the Communist and Social Democratic parties. He would pass information about the party merger and the arrests being made in order to enforce it through the still porous border West Berlin-based press contacts. He argued openly with the SPD regional party president, Heinrich Hoffmann, who had endorsed the merger. Kreutzer also maintained contacts from his Saalfeld home-base with the so-called SPD East Offices in West Berlin and Hanover, set up by leaders of the forcibly merged SPD from the Soviet occupation zone, who moved to the west because they wanted no part in the merger. The only place in the whole of Germany where it had been possible to hold a genuine member's vote among SPD members about the proposed party merger had been in West Berlin, where the idea was rejected by 82% of those voting.) =Arrest, trial and conviction= When Kreutzer was arrested again, on 4 April 1949, he was not totally surprised. This time it was not the Gestapo arresting him but the Russian secret police. He was detained at Weimar, as before identified as a political prisoner. Interrogation sessions involved beatings, immersion in cold water and sleep deprivation. Fairly soon, Kreutzer reached the point at which he would \\"sign anything\\". On 31 August, with his father, his fianc√©e (who had been working as a typist for the town council) and three other Social Democrat activists, he faced a Soviet military tribunal which was persuaded of his guilt in respect of \\"anti-Soviet propaganda\\", \\"counter-revolutionary activities\\" and \\"socialist breach of faith. The military tribunal sentenced Hermann Kreutzer, his father Paul Kreutzer, and his future wife Doroth√©e to twenty-five years of imprisonment and, according to some sources, forced labour apiece. Doroth√©e was taken to NKVD special camp Nr. 7, the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp, on the outskirts of Berlin. She was later transferred to Hoheneck women's prison in Saxony. After a brief stay at Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison, Kreutzer and his father were taken to the overcrowded correctional facility at Bautzen. A large hall intended to accommodate 200 inmates accommodated 400 with nothing to do except sit and, in winter time, freeze. Contact with Doroth√©e at Sachsenhausen was out of the question. Starvation was everywhere and tuberculosis was rampant. There were no doctors and no drugs. Dead bodies were removed just once per day, directly after the roll call was taken. On one occasion, when Kreutzer was assigned to a team digging a mass grave, they had to stop and dig a new pit in another part of the ground after reaching a large pile of bones from a previous interment. =Release and expulsion= Kreutzer and his father did not, in the end, serve out their full twenty-five year sentences. In part, they were beneficiaries of the so-called Khrushchev Thaw. More directly, according to one source, they benefitted from the intervention of a senior British politician. In the years directly following the war, and on account of the still significant international presence of the residual British empire, British politicians at that time enjoyed significant prestige and influence across Europe. First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union visited London in April 1956. Possibly through the British connections of Kreutzer's friend Walter Kaack, the Labour Party leader, Hugh Gaitskell, had become aware of the predicament of his fellow social-democrat, Hermann Kreutzer, and found an opportunity to intercede with the Soviet leader on Kreutzer's behalf. On 31 May 1956, Hermann and Paul Kreutzer were released from the Bautzen penitentiary, and quietly removed to West Berlin. In the end, there was nothing particularly quiet about the press conference Kreutzer called in West Berlin in order to demand that Doroth√©e should also be released. He threatened to cross back into East Berlin and demand to be re-arrested if his fianc√©e had not been released by the end of July. His willingness to carry out the threat was never tested. Behind the scenes other international pressure was also being applied. Early on the morning of 31 July 1949, Doroth√©e was removed from her prison and placed on a train to the border by the People's Police. It was still only 8 in the morning when she appeared at the door of the house in West Berlin in which Kereutzer was staying. In October 1956, Hermann Kreutzer and Doroth√©e Fischer were married. In West Berlin, Hermann Kreutzer immediately returned to politics, now with the West German SPD. For many years, he chaired the local party in Berlin-Tempelhof, also serving there as a local councillor and, later, as the Tempelhof local councillor with responsibility for social affairs. =Ministry for All-German Affairs / Intra-German Relations= In 1967, at the instigation of the Minister for All-German Affairs renamed in 1969 as the Ministry for Intra-German Relations, Herbert Wehner, Kreutzer switched to national politics, accepting a position as ministerial director in Wehner's ministry. The ministry's responsibilities and priorities changed over time, but its essential focus was on the endlessly changeable, complex and sensitive relationship between the government's West Germany West and East Germany. Kreutzer was given charge of administering the so-called \\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\" programme, which involved East German political prisoners being released to West Germany in return for large amounts of cash. The existence of the programme was not publicised at the time and it remained unacknowledged throughout and (less effectively) beyond the 1970s: most of the available information on its operation emerged only later. Kreutzer remained at the ministry after the coalition government fell in 1979, to be replaced by an SPD/FDP coalition government under Willy Brandt. Kreutzer's new ministerial boss was Egon Franke. It becomes clear that after 1979 Kreutzer quickly became disenchanted with the new West German government's more conciliatory approach to relations with the East German authorities, however. Between 1970 and 1980 Hermann Kreutzer sometimes deputised for Egon Bahr at meetings. The meetings involved were of a diplomatic nature and details of Kreutzer's involvement remain unknown. Bahr took the lead on behalf of Willy Brandt's government in negotiating a succession of treaties intended to regularise West Germany's relationships with governments to the east. They included the Treaties of Moscow and Warsaw (1970), the so-called Transit Treaty (1972) which secured the right of West Berliners to visit East Berlin and (under a much more restrictive set of conditions) of East Berliners to visit West Berlin. A particularly important treaty negotiated by Bahr and his team was the so- called Basic Treaty (1972). =Kurt Schumacher Circle= In 1968 Hermann Kreuzer founded the \\"Kurt Schumacher Circle\\", named after the former (western) SPD leader Kurt Schumacher. This was an organisation comprising people who had been locked up by the East German authorities and / or who had escaped / deserted from East Germany to West Germany since 1949. Kreuzer himself became the principal spokesman of the \\"Kurt Schumacher Circle\\". An important concern which Kreutzer was keen to bring to the attention of the SPD party leadership was the risk of the party becoming infiltrated by younger leftwingers who were controlled by, or at least sympathetic to the political objectives of, the government of East Germany. =Party tensions= In April 1979 Hermann Kreutzer went public with his belief that West Germany was playing host to between 10,000 and 12,000 people whom he identified as \\"agents of influence\\" (\\"Einflussagenten\\"), operating on behalf of the East German ruling party and occupying positions that enabled them to affect West German decision makers, notably within the SPD, the trades unions and the churches. Kreutzer believed that the entire affair was being orchestrated by Herbert H√§ber, an East German Central Committee member with responsibility for the west (which meant West Germany). When he went on to identify certain parliamentarians as \\"agents of influence\\", formal \\"Administrative Oversight Complaints\\" (\\"Dienstaufsichtsbeschwerde\\") were lodged against him at the Ministry for Intra-German Relations, in which at this stage he was still employed. The matter escalated. A party exclusion commission produced conclusions against Kreutzer which one source, unpersuaded by his allegations, identified as unexpectedly lenient. Although Kreutzer himself showed little appetite for downplaying the whole business, there were those in positions of influence within the party who were keen to avoid making a political martyr of Kreutzer among people who believed that he was almost certainly correct - in general terms if not in every precise details - about East German attempts to influence opinion in West Germany.. During 1980 Kreutzer went public and personal with criticisms of party leader, ex-chancellor Brandt whose policy towards East Germany Ostpolitik he thought at best na√Øf. Shortly after this Hermann Kreutzer was operationally retired (\\"dienstlich in den Ruhestand versetzt\\"). Shortly before the 1980 general election Hermann Kreutzer made a public appeal to voters to back the opposition CDU (party) with their votes. Sources differ over whether at this point he was expelled from the SPD or whether he anticipated expulsion by resigning his membership.Opposition und Widerstand in der DDR. p. 104. =Later years= Although 1980 marked an end to his involvement with the SPD, Kreutzer remained politically engaged. He re- organised the Kurt Schumacher Circle which now became part of the \\"Gesellschaft f√ºr soziale Demokratie e. V.\\" (\\"Society for Social Democracy\\") which had been founded in 1982. Its membership was composed mostly of former SPD members who in the past had been part of the party's right wing, many of them supporters of Fritz Erler. An enduring theme remained opposition to the East German ruling SED (party). After the changes and reunification in 1990 the SED scrambled to reinvent itself for a democratic future, relaunching itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). Long before 1990, Kreutzer was researching and recording the East German regime's crimes. After 1990 he remained unpersuaded that the party could have changed fundamentally. During the 1990s and on through the new century Hermann Kreutzer continued to deliver lectures on his experiences of the East German prison system. He also co-wrote a biography of Marlene Dietrich which was published in 2001 in which he held out the singer-actress as a consistent and uncompromising opponent of National Socialism.

It was a one-off purpose-built racer for the second edition of the 500 Miles of Monza to compete against American race cars. The 412 MI scored a pole position and finished the race on a third place, which was the best European-entry result. As per naming convention \\"412\\" stood for 4-litre, 12-cylinder engine. The \\"MI\\" suffix stood for \\"Monza-Indianapolis\\". Development At the Autodromo Nazionale Monza in 1958, the second race between European single seaters and sports cars and the American purpose-built racers was held. The track was prepared in 1955 in the Indianapolis oval circuit style with banked curves. The race was divided into three legs, for a total of . It was the fastest race at that time with a highest speeds recorded at , compared to a record of at the 1958 Indianapolis 500. Ferrari entered three cars in this race to Indycar regulations. The 412 MI was the most powerful Ferrari entry in the Race of Two Worlds. The car combined an older 375 F1-sourced chassis with a new bodywork and a modified 4.0-litre V12 engine from the 335 S sports car. High capacity engines were superfluous in light of the 3-litre cap regulations instilled for the 1958 season. Ferrari chose to use the same Firestone tyres as American teams, rather than the Belgian Englebert tyre supplier the company had used at that time. This decision was due to the fear that they were not suitable for a high speed track and might throw threads. The Ferrari 412 MI prepared for this race was to be driven by Luigi Musso and Mike Hawthorn duo. Specifications The 412 MI had a 60¬∞ Jano V12 engine mounted longitudinally in the front. The engine was sourced from the 335 S sports car that ran in the 1957 Mille Miglia. The internal measurements remained the same as the donor-engine at of bore and stroke. The resulting total displacement was . Much higher compression ratio of 9.9:1 and higher redline resulted in a significant increase of power, now at an impressive at 7700 rpm. It was the most powerful engine Ferrari had produced to that time. The engine had a DOHC configuration to actuate two valves per cylinder. Fuel and air mixture was fed by six Weber 42DCN carburettors, slightly smaller than the 335 S had. A dry sump lubrication system was standard on all Jano V12s. The tubular steel spaceframe chassis was based on an older Formula One Ferrari 375, modified to accommodate new engine. The front suspension was independent with double wishbones, coil springs instead of a leaf springs and hydraulic shock absorbers. The rear suspension had a De Dion axle with twin radius arms, transverse leaf spring and hydraulic shock absorbers. An anti-roll bars were installed as they were not originally present on the 1950-made 375 F1 chassis. Brakes were of a drum type and a transmission was a three-speed only. Fuel tank had a capacity of 204 litres. Mike Hawthorn during practice. Racing Initially Mike Hawthorn was assigned to drive the Ferrari 412 MI #12 for the 1958 edition of the Race of Two Worlds. But when he felt unwell, his teammate Luigi Musso had to run the race. Hawthorn and Phil Hill drove the car later, as a relief drivers. Qualifying began late on Friday when the track had dried up. Luigi Musso recorded the fastest time of all the European entries, with a 55.3 second lap in the 412 MI. He was only 0.1 second slower than Fangio in the Kuzma-Offy racer. But since the qualifying was determined by an average speed of three laps, and Musso was able to improve on his previous performance and recorded an average speed of to earn pole position for the race. Heat one began with a rolling start of eighteen cars, as Fangio withdrew early with a cracked piston. Musso traded off the lead position with Eddie Sachs, with Jimmy Bryan also taking the second place. As Jim Rathmann took the lead from the Sachs, the latter retired with a broken connecting rod. This allowed Musso to jump to a second place, bu after a methanol fumes inhalation he dropped back couple of places and had to be relieved by Hawthorn on lap 27. Hawthorn gave the car back to Musso on the last lap of the first heat and Musso had secured the sixth place and 60 laps. During heat two of the race, Musso was once again among the top drivers. After only nineteen laps he had to be replaced by Phil Hill whose Ferrari 326 MI #14 had retired with a broken magneto in the first heat. Hill drove the car till the end of the heat, managed to secure another 60 laps but dropped to the ninth place. Heat three was started by Mike Hawthorn in the 412 MI, in place of Luigi Musso. After 24 laps Hawthorn succumbed to methanol fumes as Musso in heat one, and had to be relieved by Phil Hill. Hill brought the team up to a third place. He gave the car back to Hawthorn, who secured yet another 60 laps and finished the race for a third overall for Ferrari. Because of the very high speeds and safety issues the Race of Two Worlds for the 1959 season was cancelled and had never returned. Ferrari, unlike Maserati, did not pursue this form of racing and did not participate in the 1959 Indianapolis 500 race.

While state-level campaigns often lack funding, College Promise highlights growing concerns about unaffordable college costs and student loan debt in the United States. College Promise is an initiative of Civic Nation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2015. History Higher education in the United States has been restrictive for most of US history, serving elites at first, and slowly growing more democratic from the 1800s to the early 2000s. Government action such as the Morrill Act, GI Bill and Civil Rights Act increased accessibility while growing student populations. In the 1960s, community colleges were low cost, and some larger universities were also low cost. For many reasons, college affordability has been a significant issue in US higher education, especially since 1970. In 2005, the Kalamazoo Promise program was instituted so that local high school students could attend Michigan colleges with a 65 percent to 100 percent tuition discount. In 2014, Tennessee was the first state to initiate a program for free tuition at community colleges. In his 2015 State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama proposed making community college tuition free to many residents of the US. Despite its popularity, the plan did not materialize. In September 2015, the College Promise Campaign was started, which serves to educate and promote College Promise programs in the United States. At that time, there were 53 College Promise Programs in place. By 2017, 16 states had at least one statewide College Promise program. A year later, the College Promise movement grew to over 300 programs in 24 states. As of September 2019, it was observed that there are over 320 College Promise Programs in 47 states nationwide. Leadership The College Promise advisory board consists of 37 leaders representing interests from education, business, philanthropy, labor, nonprofits, government, and students. Funding College Promise's donors include the Kresge Foundation, Carnegie Corporation of New York, J.P. Morgan, Great Lakes, Arconic Foundation, and the Joyce Foundation. Research about College Promise programs How each College Promise program works influences its effectiveness. According to the Institute for Women‚Äôs Policy Research (IWPR), College Promise programs that only cover tuition costs may be insufficient for working-class people who may need help with housing, childcare, food and transportation costs. Other researchers have reported similar limitations. = Pacific NW Study = One of the early Promise Programs began in 2007 in the Pacific Northwest; graduating students from one high school were able to attend their first year of a local community college due to scholarships with both government and private funding. The selected high school was located in a large city in a low-income neighborhood, and more than half of the students were minorities. From the period between 2005 and 2007 before the Promise Program was announced, only 6.2% of graduating seniors enrolled in college, but following the implementation of the Promise program in 2008, 60.7% of graduating seniors enrolled to college. The fall-to winter retention rates of first-year students who attended college because of the Promise Program was 90%, indicating that the initiative increased student enrollment in college and academic success. Despite the high retention rates observed in this study, few students were placed into college-level math and English classes, and the average college grade point average (GPA) during their freshman year was 1.83, suggesting that students were not prepared in high school for the rigor of college classes. A total of 51 students participated in the study, with 46 students reenrolling for a second semester. Nonetheless, this Promise Program increased college attendance for lower- income students more than other Promise Programs, such as the Oregon Promise, because it does not take into account family income. = Oregon Study = A state-wide Promise Program was started in Oregon in 2016, where community college tuition is covered to residents of Oregon with a cumulative high school GPA of 2.5 or higher. The Oregon Promise is a ‚Äúlast-dollar‚Äù scholarship, meaning that aid will only be rewarded after all other federal loans are applied, such as the Pell Grant. In 2016‚Äì2017, students from middle- income families received 53% of all aid rewarded from the Oregon Promise because they did not meet the requirements for the Pell Grant, while lower- income families received 47% of tuition covered because slightly higher percentages of these students qualified for more federal and state grants. Overall, 6,745 students who attended Oregon Community Colleges received the scholarship out of 10,500 applicants who met the scholarship requirements. Despite the problems in allocating scholarships primarily to need-based students, it was observed that Oregon community colleges saw an increase of 4%-5% in student enrollment in 2017. Last Dollar vs First Dollar Promise Programs Most Promise Programs in the United States currently award scholarships on a ‚Äúlast dollar‚Äù approach, meaning that students who qualify for need-based grants will only receive their scholarships after federal and state grants are exhausted. Creating programs based on ‚Äúlast dollar‚Äù financial aid is cheaper to states and cities than the alternate ‚Äúfirst dollar‚Äù scholarships. In ‚Äúlast dollar‚Äù programs, low-income students should be receiving less aid from Promise scholarships than middle-income and high- income students, however this is not necessarily true. Lower-income students will receive their Promise Program scholarship as well as federal grants, but middle-class students may only receive the Promise Program scholarship. Many middle-class families make too much money for students to qualify for federal grants such as the Pell Grant, but they do not make enough to comfortably send their children to public universities even with financial aid. Often middle- class families are not able to afford college tuition prices and do not receive additional aid, and these students end up graduating college with thousands of dollars in student loan debt. Shifting scholarship aid from ‚Äúlast dollar‚Äù to ‚Äúfirst dollar‚Äù can greatly benefit both low-income and middle-class students, but that would require the assistance of the federal government. = Kalamazoo Study = A well-known example is seen in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where Kalamazoo Public School (KPS) students have 100% of their tuition covered by anonymous donors in Michigan universities if they attended KPS from kindergarten through 12th grade. When Kalamazoo announced their Promise Program in 2005, KPS schools saw a surge in student enrollment, while other districts across the state and nation saw a decline in student enrollment. In 2009, it was observed that enrollment in KPS increased by 2,400 students. Not only were there more students enrolling, but schools also observed less high school seniors students drop-out. The effects of the Promise Program made many positive advancements in Kalamazoo, especially since many of the students in KPS came from poorer communities. Many more students have the opportunity to attend college, when they otherwise would not have had the chance. The Kalamazoo Promise is still in effect as of 2020, and will be continuing indefinitely. = Problems Associated with Expanding Promise Programs = Although there are many reasons why free higher education is beneficial to society, there are also problems that will arise if Promise Programs are instituted nationwide. President Lyndon B. Johnson implemented federal student loan and grant programs in 1965, which was supposed to help lower income students attend college. With the promise that universities would be receiving federal aid, college tuition prices soared. Furthermore, if public universities become free to all students, more students will have access to higher education and will be expected to retain a degree, regardless of whether they actually need one. The cost to taxpayers would be very high if free universities are put into effect in all U.S. states. also *Higher education in the United States *Community colleges in the United States *Student loan debt in the United States *Kalamazoo Promise References Category:Student loans in the United States ","title":"College Promise"},{"id":"61222122","text":"Kronborg Glacier () is a glacier on the east coast of the Greenland ice sheet.

Early life  Koolmatrie was born in Wudinna, Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. Her father was a Kokatha man, Joseph Roberts, and her mother Margaret was a Ngarrindjeri / Ramindjeri woman from the Coorong. Koolmatrie grew up in Meningie and the Coorong region, later moving to the Riverland town, Berri.  Career  Koolmatrie learned her craft in the early 1980s from elder and weaver, Dorothy Kartinyeri. Their coiled bundle technique uses local spiny-headed sedge (Cyperus gymnocaulos), known to the artist as bilbili and river rushes, and Koolmatrie is credited with saving the traditional Ngarrindjeri craft. Koolmatrie is defiant in using her practice to dismantle the colonial myth that Ngarrindjeri culture and weaving practices are extinct. Her work stands as a testimony that the practice is alive and continuing. Her weavings include eel traps, turtles, mats, bowls and models of biplanes.She was excited by the potential offered by woven sedge grass and this was seen, by Stephen Gilchrist as having ‚Äúfreed her imagination to breathe life into the fantastic woven articulations that are now her trademark.‚Äù Koolmatrie work is influenced by Janet Watson's woven works monoplane (1942) and bi-plane (1942) in the South Australia Museum, Watson is an Australian indigenous woman who learn't weaving from her family.

The machine premiered at the 2013 EICMA, but production was delayed due to the financial crisis being experienced by the manufacturer. The motorcycle was first made available to the press for road tests in April 2015. Overview The Turismo Veloce (Italian for Fast Touring) is advertised as a \\"The Tourer With A Racing Spirit\\", being a sports bike built into touring bodywork. It is aimed at the same sport touring market as the Ducati Multistrada and Kawasaki Ninja 1000. Originally designed by Ezio Mascheroni, the three cylinder, 4 stroke, 12 valve, DOHC engine is derived from unit in the MV Agusta F3 800. The engine has a counter rotating crankshaft, normally only found on GP machines, which counteracts the centripetal forces of the wheels allowing the bike to turn faster. The power output is 110 hp at 10,000 rpm, giving a maximum speed of 143 mph (230 km/h). Standard features include ABS, cruise control, four driving modes and engine maps that cut the power delivered by the engine to better adapt the bike to driving and road conditions (Rain 80 bhp, Touring 90 bhp, Sport 110 bhp and \\"Custom\\", which is customisable by the rider, the MVCSC (MV Agusta Chassis Stability Control) and MVICS 2.0 (Motor & Vehicle Integrated Control System) and the six-speed electronic gearbox. Initially, due to the continuing financial crisis of MV Agusta. production numbers were limited, with the Turismo Veloce and the Rivale only having 181 registrations combined in the first months of 2016. Model Variants In addition to the standard Turismo Veloce, 3 variants have been produced. =Turismo Veloce Lusso= The Turismo Veloce Lusso (luxury) is an upmarket version of the Turismo Veloce. It is fitted with an LED headlamp, sat-nav, heated grips and hand guards. The bike is fitted with Sachs Skyhook electronic suspension, a semi-active system. =Turismo Veloce Lusso SCS= Introduced in 2018, the Turismo Veloce Lusso SCS adds the Smart Clutch System (SCS) to the Lusso, which allows electronic management to the clutch system. The rider can use the clutch in a conventional manner with the lever, or simply allow the system to control the clutch. The system is based on the Rekluse clutch, which allows the rider to engage gear at tickover without using the clutch. Once the throttle is opened the clutch engages. The MV system adds electronic control, which optimises clutch engagement based on engine revs and throttle position. This, combined with the traction and anti-wheelie controls, gives the bike a launch control, and 0-60 mph in 3.1 seconds is consistently achievable. =Turismo Veloce RC= The Turismo Veloce RC (Reparto Corse) was first shown at the 2016 EICMA Milan Show. This limited edition is of 250 machines. It features all the \\"extras\\" of the Lusso SCS and adds a carbon fiber front mudguard, forged aluminium racing wheels from the F4 and Reparto Corse graphics. =Turismo Veloce RC SCS= The Turismo Veloce RC RR was further enhanced for 2019 with the addition of the SCS 2.0 Smart Clutch System and a limited run of 250 Turismo Veloce RC SCS models produced. The SCS 2.0 system, which was first fitted on the Turismo Veloce 800 Lusso SCS in 2018, allows the rider to use the clutch in a conventional manner with the lever, or simply allow the system to control the clutch. The SCS system weighs just 36g more than a conventional clutch. =Turismo Veloce 800 Rosso= Introduced at the 2019 EICMA Milan Show, the Turismo Veloce 800 Rosso is part of MV's entry-level Rosso collection.

She was dismissed from her court duties due to being a Hugenot.  Biography  Michelle de Saubonne was born in 1485 to Protestant humanist and nobleman Denis de Saubonne, Lord of Fresnes-Coudray. She was raised in the Calvinist faith. In 1505 she was chosen to serve as a companion of Anne of Brittany and was charged with taking care of the queen's jewels and linens. She shared the role of queen's secretary with H√©l√®ne de Laval. She was instrumental in bringing Jean Marot to the French court, whose poems were admired by the queen. She also introduced the queen to other writers of that time, including Jean Lemaire de Belges. In 1508 she married Jean IV of Parthenay, Lord of Soubise. She was Parthenay's second wife. He died five years later. Through her son, Jean V de Parthenay, she is the grandmother of mathematician Catherine de Parthenay. In 1510 she was appointed by Louis XII to the post of Governess of the Children of France. As royal governess, she was in charge of the education of the king and queen's youngest daughter, Ren√©e of France. She was banished from court in 1515 by Francis I of France for apposing the annexation of Brittany to the French crown, her sympathy for the Reformed Church, and for her support for Anne of Brittany over Louise of Savoy. She left the court with her four children and lived at her home in Park-Soubise, where she taught them Greek and Latin and instructed them in Reformed Christian teachings. In 1528 she was invited to the Court of Ferrara by her former pupil, Ren√©e de France, who had married Ercole II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. She was appointed as governess for the two daughters and son of the Duke of Ferrara. Ren√©e de France and her children began practicing Calvinism, despite the Counter-Reformation taking place in Ferrara. Ercole II did not approve of French influence at his court and had all French nobles dismissed, including de Saubonne. She returned to France and lived in Saintonge. She died in 1549 in Saintonge.

A wargame at the US Marine Corps War College (April 2019). A wargame, generally, is a type of strategy game which realistically simulates warfare. A military wargame, specifically, is a wargame that is used by some military organizations to train officers in tactical and strategic decision-making, to test new tactics and strategies, or to predict trends in future conflicts. Overview =Definition= The exact definition of \\"wargame\\" varies from one writer to the next and one organization to the next. To prevent confusion, this section will establish the general definition employed by this article. *A wargame simulates an armed conflict, be it a battle, a campaign, or an entire war. \\"Business wargames\\" do not simulate armed conflict and are therefore outside the scope of this article. *A wargame is adversarial. There must be two opposing sides whose players react intelligently to each other's decisions.Wargaming Handbook (MoD 2017), p. 21 *A wargame must have at least one human player.Perla (1990), The Art of Wargaming: \\"A real wargame must have human players whose decision affect and are affected by the flow of game events.\\" *A wargame does not involve the use of actual troops and armaments. This definition is used by the US Naval War College.War Gamer's Handbook (US Naval War College), p. 4: \\"The [U.S. Naval War College's War Gaming Department] uses the Perla (1990) definition, which describes war gaming as \\"...a warfare model or simulation whose operation does not involve the activities of actual military forces, and whose sequence of events affects and is, in turn, affected by the decisions made by players representing the opposing sides\\" (Perla, 1990, p. 164). By doing so, this differentiates a war game from a training exercise, which uses real forces.\\" Some writers use the term \\"live wargames\\" to refer to games that use actual troops in the field,Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 270: \\"Live wargames are the next oldest. Everything from medieval jousts to Red Flag exercises are live wargames because actual forces engage in (simulated) combat, adjudicated by nonlethal means.\\" but this article shall instead refer to these as field exercises. Some military wargamers feel that the term \\"game\\" trivializes what they see as a serious, professional tool. One of these was Georg von Reisswitz, the creator of Kriegsspiel and the father of military wargaming, but he stuck with the word \\"game\\" because he could not think of a better term.: \\"The one thing which did not satisfy Von Reisswitz was the word \\"game;\\" but not finding anything to take its place he retained it.\\" In the US Army, many preferred the term \\"map maneuvers\\" (in contrast to \\"field maneuvers\\"). At the US Naval War College, some preferred the terms \\"chart maneuvers\\" (when simulating campaigns) and \\"board maneuvers\\" (when simulating battles), although the term \\"war game\\" was never officially proscribed.William McCarty Little (1912), quoted in Perla (1990), The Art of Wargaming: \\"In embarking on this lecture I would like to say, by way of preface, that the name Game, War Game, has had much the same depreciating effect as the term Sham Fight has had with regard to field maneuvers. To avoid this, the Army has had recourse to the expression Map Maneuver. We, of the Navy, may in like manner say Chart Maneuver, and we have lately decided so to do.\\"Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 46: \\"The Big Game, generally a series of maneuvers played in stages set in the same scenario, started with chart maneuvers for logistics planning, search, and screening, and it culminated in a large-scale tactical board maneuver.\\" =Military wargames vs commercial wargames= As military wargames are used to prepare officers for actual warfare, there is naturally a strong emphasis on realism and current events. Historical wargames are wargames set in the distant past, such as World War 2 or the Napoleonic Wars--simulating these wars realistically may be of interest to historians, but are of little use to the military. Recreational wargames may take some creative liberties with reality, such as simplifying models to make them more enjoyable, or adding fictional armaments and units such as orcs and wizards, making them of little use to officers who must fight in the real world. Military organizations are typically secretive about their current wargames, and this makes designing a military wargame a challenge. Secrecy makes it harder to disseminate corrections if the wargame has already been delivered to the clients. Whereas a commercial wargame might have thousands or even millions of players, military wargames tend to have small player bases, which makes it harder for the designers to acquire feedback. As a consequence, errors in wargame models tend to persist.\\"Creveld (2013), Wargames: \\"Much of the data that goes into the programs is classified: as a result, checking on whether it is correct is difficult, and errors, once they have crept in, tend to stay. Secrecy also makes it hard to update the games as needed.\\"Perla (1990), The Art of Wargaming: \\"Unlike those in the wargaming hobby, professional wargamers work in a relatively closed society. One organization's games are not freely available for all to try, critique, and modify. Professional wargame designers may document their games (usually in classified publications), but they seldom describe the design process they employed to create them.\\" Although commercial wargame designers take consumer trends and player feedback into account, their products are usually designed and sold with a take-it-or-leave-it approach. Military wargames, by contrast, are typically commissioned by the military that plans to use them. If a wargame is commissioned by several clients, then the designer will have to juggle their competing demands. This can lead to great complexity, high development costs, and a compromised product that satisfies nobody.Creveld (2013), Wargames: \\"One is the need to satisfy the requirements of many different user organizations each of which does not wish to buy the game off the shelf but actively attempts to pull it in its own direction. Often the outcome is great complexity and compromises that end up, like the famous camel that was created by a committee, by satisfying nobody.\\" Commercial wargames are under more pressure to deliver an enjoyable experience for the players, who expect a user-friendly interface, a reasonable learning curve, exciting gameplay, and so forth. By contrast, military organizations tend to see wargaming as a tool and a chore, and players are often bluntly obliged to use whatever is provided to them.Creveld (2013), Wargames: \\"Finally, those who design, manufacture, and market games in the commercial world are obliged to pay attention to users' demands, such as ease of play and creating a good interface between player and game. Their counterparts working in, or for, the military, are not nearly as affected by these concerns. On occasion this can lead to bad games that people simply do not want to play.\\" Military wargames that are arbitrated by an umpire or the players themselves (manual wargames) tend to have simple models and computations compared to recreational wargames. Umpires may even be allowed to make arbitrary decisions using their own expertise. One reason for this is to keep the learning curve small. Recreational wargamers tend to have a lot of wargaming experience, so learning a complicated new wargame is easy if it is similar enough to ones they've already played. By contrast, military officers typically have little or no wargaming experience. A second reason is that the technical data required to design an accurate and precise model, such as the performance characteristics of a fighter jet, is often classified. Design concepts =Models= The term \\"model\\" can mean two things in wargaming. One is the conceptual models that describe the properties, capabilities, and behaviors of the things the wargame attempts to simulate (weapons, vehicles, troops, terrain, weather, etc.). The other meaning, from miniature wargaming (a form of recreational wargaming), is physical models, i.e. sculptures of soldiers, vehicles, and terrain; which generally serve an aesthetic purpose and have little if any consequence on the simulation. Military wargames rarely use physical models because aesthetics aren't important to the military and the scale at which military wargames typically play make physical models impractical. Therefore, this article will focus on conceptual models. A wargame is about decision-making, not about learning the technical capabilities of a particular weapon or vehicle. Therefore, a well-designed model will not describe something beyond what a player needs to know to make effective decisions. Players should not be burdened with cumbersome calculations, because this slows down the game and distracts the players. If a player makes a bad decision, it should only be because of poor strategic thinking, not some forgotten rule or arithmetic error, otherwise the game will yield less reliable insights. If the wargame is computer-assisted, then sophisticated models are feasible because they can be written into the software and processed quickly by the computer. For manual wargames, simplicity is paramount. =Level of War= In a tactical-level wargame, the scope of the simulated conflict is a single battle. Kriegsspiel, the original military wargame, is an example of a tactical-level wargame. In a strategic- level wargame, the scope of the simulated conflict is a campaign or even an entire war. An example is the \\"Chart Maneuvers\\" practiced by the US Naval War College during the 1920s and 1930s, which most often simulated a hypothetical war in the Pacific against Japan. Battles are resolved through simple computation. The players concern themselves with higher-level, strategic concerns such as logistics and diplomacy. Utility =General strengths and limitations= In comparison to field exercises, wargames save time and money. They can be organized quickly and cheaply as they do not require the mobilization of thousands of men, their armaments, and logistics systems. Some wargames can be completed more quickly than the conflicts they simulate by compressing time. In a naval wargame, the players need not wait days for their fleets to sail across the ocean, they could just advance the time-frame to the next decision they must make. This is particularly advantageous for strategic- level games, in which the simulated conflict might last months. A tactical- level wargame that has very cumbersome computations might take longer to play out than the battle it represents (this problem afflicted the original Kriegsspiel). Wargamers can experiment with assets that their military does not actually possess, such as alliances that their country does not have, armaments that they have yet to acquire, and even hypothetical technologies that have yet to be invented. For example: After World War I, Germany was forced to downsize its armed forces and outright give up certain weapons such as planes, tanks, and submarines. This made it difficult if not impossible for German officers to develop their doctrines through field exercises. The Germans greatly expanded their use of wargaming to compensate. When Germany began openly rearming in 1934, its officers already had fairly well-developed theories on what armaments to buy and what organizational reforms to implement.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 282 Wargames cannot be used to predict the progression and outcome of a war as one might predict the weather. Human behavior is too difficult predict for that. Wargames cannot provoke the anxiety, anger, stress, fatigue, etc. that a commander will experience in actual combat and thus cannot foresee the effects of these emotions on his decision-making.Perla (1990), The Art of Wargaming: \\"The first thing to remember is that wargames, exercises, and analysis involve no actual fighting. Because this is the case, none of these tools can capture all of the human elements of real combat. Military history is full of examples in which courage, fear, morale, and leadership provided the decisive determinants of defeat or victory. Wargames and exercises, by requiring participants to process information and make decisions in the presence of uncertainty and under the pressure of time, provide greater opportunities for exploring some of these factors than does analysis, but even their ability to re-create the stresses of combat is limited.\\" That said, no training tool can replicate the emotional experience of war, so this is not a specific flaw. Another issue that can produce \\"wrong\\" predictions is that a commander may do things differently in the field precisely because he was dissatisfied with the decisions he made in the wargames.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 280-281: \\"More importantly, Blue may do so because the decision makers, not liking how a wargame turned out, have addressed on wargaming the reason, in order to change how the actual event will turn out.\\" =Education= Wargames are a cost-effective way of giving officers the experience (or something resembling experience) of making decisions as a leader in an armed conflict. This is the oldest application of wargaming. The actual effectiveness of wargaming in this regard--turning a bad strategist into a good one--is difficult to measure because officers use many tools to hone their decision-making skills and the effect of wargaming is difficult to isolate.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 282-283: \\"Wargaming can be useful in developing the potential of individuals. This being the oldest application of wargaming, one might assume that its usefulness has the most historical support. Unfortunately, if history includes an account of a prince with a record of losing battles taking up chess and then going on to victory, I have yet to find it. The increase in military effectiveness with the founding of staff and war colleges might be seen as pertinent. Still, wargaming made up just one part of the individuals‚Äô studies, making the effect of gaming alone difficult to isolate.\\" In this context, wargames are used to help players understand the decision-making process of wartime command. Wargames can help players master through practice certain routine skills such as how to discuss ideas, share intel, and communicate orders. Wargames can present the players with intellectual challenges that they cannot receive from books or in the classroom: an enemy who reacts unpredictably and intelligently to the player's decisions, Wargames train players to evaluate situations and make decisions faster. They teach players how to discuss ideas, and the protocols for sharing intel and communicating orders.Vego (2012), German War Gaming, p. 115: \\"The Germans emphasized the importance of concise and logical presentation of ideas, in making decisions and issuing orders based on them. Another purpose of a war game was training in techniques and procedures of writing and issuing orders.\\" They teach the players how to cope with incomplete, delayed, incorrect, or superfluous information. They teach the player how to cope with an unpredictable foe who reacts intelligently to their decisions. Wargames can also help familiarize the players with the geography of areas where they might eventually have to fight in. This was an oft-cited justification for wargaming at the US Naval War College.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 110: \\"..they provided an opportunity for students to familiarize themselves with geographic areas of future strategic interest.\\" =Research and planning= Wargames can predict likely trends in upcoming conflicts. They can be used to prepare grand strategic plans and develop doctrine. Wargames can help a military determine what armaments and infrastructure it should acquire (there is substantial historical evidence to support this particular assertion).Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 282: \\"Wargames can be useful as aids in making specific decisions on the acquisition of military forces and militarily significant infrastructure. The historical record is particularly strong in this area.\\" For instance: In the 1920s, American military planners believed that America could win a war with Japan quickly by simply sailing an armada across the Pacific and knocking out the Japanese navy in a few decisive battles.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 70: \\"The Mahanian strategy was to gather the battle fleet in a large formation, steam forward to a point where the enemy would be compelled to bring out their fleet, use the firepower of dreadnought battleships to overwhelm the enemy battle line, and then blockade the enemy‚Äôs home waters. [...] This doctrine called for the U.S. Navy to steam directly across the central Pacific, engage the Japanese fleet in force, and defeat them as quickly as possible while the garrison defending the Philippines withdrew to the Bataan peninsula and fought a delaying action.\\" But when this strategy was tested in wargames, it routinely failed. Japan held off the assault until the American armada exhausted itself, and then counter-attacked. The wargames foretold that a war with Japan would instead be a prolonged war of attrition, and America would need advance bases in the western Pacific where its warships could get resupplied and repaired.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 106: \\"Repeated experiments with all manner of approaches to the ORANGE war led to the same conclusion‚Äîthat the U.S. Navy‚Äôs thruster strategy for the Pacific was not workable with the fleet in hand. The realization summarized in Van Auken‚Äôs report led the Research Department to conduct a comprehensive review of all of the trans-Pacific games played between 1927 and 1933. The Department compared BLUE and ORANGE losses in each game as a function of the BLUE force‚Äôs approach route, ORANGE defensive strategy, force composition (either actual or in accordance with the London Treaty), and BLUE force speed of advance. They concluded that variations in each of these factors made little difference in the game outcomes, and that BLUE would be at a major disadvantage in trying to fight their way past ORANGE-held island bases to reach the Philippines, simply because their continued advance put them farther and farther from their support infrastructure.\\": \\"[The US Navy] developed in gaming the doctrine and practice of progressive transoceanic offensive operations, where there had been before mere transit itinerary.\\" Such an infrastructure would require making alliances with friendly countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and the British Empire.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 103: \\"A major point stressed by the Research Department was that the BLUE fleet‚Äôs approach route highlighted the previously underappreciated need to receive fuel, provisioning, and basing support from allies in the region, namely England, Australia, and the Netherlands East Indies, and the need to repair underwater battle damage closer to the theater of operations.\\" Wargames can also be used to develop the potential of new technology. In order to wield a new technology optimally, it is not enough for a military to merely have it, but also develop good tactics and know how to organize around it. If the enemy isn't exploring the same issues in their own wargames, then one can gain a significant edge over the enemy when war breaks out by deploying a more mature doctrine.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 286-287 An example is German submarine doctrine in the World Wars. In World War I, submarines were a new thing and nobody knew how best to use them, and Germany developed its submarine doctrine on the go. The German navy at the time did not use wargames and tested new ideas immediately against the British. Consequently, for every incremental innovation in submarine warfare that the Germans deployed, the British quickly developed a counter-measure and kept pace, and this limited the impact of submarines in World War I. During the inter-war years, the German navy experimented extensively with new submarine tactics in wargames (in tandem with field exercises) and developed the \\"wolf-pack\\" doctrine to defeat the anti-submarine counter-measures that had been developed during World War I (notably the convoy system). The British, by contrast, did not experiment quite so extensively with submarines in their own wargames because they thought that their established counter-measures were sufficient. Their lack of preparedness contributed to the great success of German submarine attacks in the opening months of World War II. The Germans entered the war with a whole bag of new tricks, and it took some time for the British to catch up.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 45: \\"Germany‚Äôs wolf-pack doctrine for U-boats is an even clearer example of the power of its interwar application of live and map-based wargames. Britain ended World War I with the submarine threat substantially under control, and it correctly estimated technological advances during the interwar period would favor antisubmarine warfare. Britain was accordingly almost unconcerned about the German submarine threat when World War II began. Unfortunately for Britain, Germany‚Äôs submarine doctrine, which was largely developed even before Germany acquired U-boats, allowed it to win the first several rounds of the Battle of the Atlantic, sinking shipping far faster than the Allies could build replacements.\\" History =The Reisswitzian wargame= Around the turn of the 19th century, a number of European inventors created wargames based on chess. These games used pieces that represented real army units (infantry, artillery, etc.) and the squares on the board were color-coded to represent different terrain types (rivers, marshes, mountains, etc.). Basing these games on chess made them attractive and accessible to chess players,In a letter from Hellwig (an early wargame inventor), dated 26 September 1801, quoted in : \\"The first thought which presented itself to my mind was that the learning of my game ought not to be burdened with too many details if it was to fulfill its mission. I judged from the first that I should achieve my object in the quickest way if I took for its basis the game of chess, in favor with so many distinguished persons of all ranks. My idea was to adapt, as far as possible, the game of chess to my own game, in order so to interest amateurs that they would at least give mine a trial. [...] experience confirmed the wisdom of my expectations, for chess players were the first to welcome my invention [...]\\" but also made them too unrealistic to be taken seriously by the army. The grid forced the terrain into unnatural forms, such as rivers flowing in straight lines and bending at right angles; and only a single piece could occupy a square at a time, even if that square represented a square mile.Peterson (2012), Playing At War:\\"...the grid imposed on the wargames of Hellwig and Venturini significantly limited the capacity of these systems to represent the position of troops realistically. Effectively, in a board wargame divided into squares of a scale mile across, there is only one position that troops within a mile‚Äôs range could hold.\\": \\"In these early attempts the landscape had been forced into squares and triangles, with rivers, seas, villages, mountains, valleys and so on pushed out of their natural shapes and into straight lines. In the same way movements of troops, the representation of troop types, the effect of firepower, were also severely modified in such a way that a realistic picture of events failed to be produced.\\" A reconstruction of the wargame developed in 1824 by Reisswitz In 1824, a Prussian army officer named Georg von Reisswitz presented to the Prussian General Staff a wargame that he and his father had developed over the years. It was a highly realistic wargame designed strictly for use as a professional tool of training, and not for leisure. Instead of a chess-like grid, this game was played on accurate paper maps of the kind the Prussian army used. This allowed the game to model terrain naturally and simulate battles in real locations. The pieces could be moved across the map in a free-form manner, subject to terrain obstacles. The pieces, each of which represented some kind of army unit (an infantry battalion, a cavalry squadron, etc.), were little rectangular blocks made of lead. The pieces were painted either red or blue to indicate the faction it belonged to. The blue pieces were used to represent the Prussian army and red was used to represent some foreign enemy--since then it has been the convention in military wargaming to use blue to represent the faction to which the players actually belong to. The game used dice to add a degree of randomness to combat. The scale of the map was 1:8000 and the pieces were made to the same proportions as the units they represented, such that each piece occupied the same relative space on the map as the corresponding unit did on the battlefield. The game modeled the capabilities of the units realistically using data gathered by the Prussian army during the Napoleonic Wars and various field exercises. Reisswitz's manual provided tables that listed how far each unit type could move in a round according to the terrain it was crossing and whether it was marching, running, galloping, etc.; and accordingly the umpire used a ruler to move the pieces across the map. The game used dice to determine combat results and inflicted casualties, and the casualties inflicted by firearms and artillery decreased over distance. Unlike chess pieces, units in Reisswitz's game could suffer partial losses before being defeated, which were tracked on a sheet of paper (recreational gamers might call this \\"hitpoint tracking\\"). The game also had some rules that modeled morale and exhaustion. Reisswitz's game also used an umpire. The players did not directly control the pieces on the game map. Rather, they wrote orders for their virtual troops on pieces of paper, which they submitted to the umpire. The umpire then moved the pieces across the game map according to how he judged the virtual troops would interpret and carry out their orders.Peterson (2012), Playing At War:\\"In addition to establishing the general idea and the composition of the opposing forces, the umpire serves as an intermediary for virtually all actions in the game: all movements, all communications and all attacks channel through the umpire, in writing. The players transmit written orders, authored to their units in the persona of a commander, and for the most part the umpire enjoys significant leeway in deciding how these orders will be interpreted.\\" When the troops engaged the enemy on the map, it was umpire who rolled the dice, computed the effects, and removed defeated units from the map. The umpire also managed secret information so as to simulate the fog of war. The umpire placed pieces on the map only for those units which he judged both sides could see. He kept a mental track of where the hidden units were, and only placed their pieces on the map when he judged they came into view of the enemy. Earlier wargames had fixed victory conditions, such as occupying the enemy's fortress. By contrast, Reisswitz's wargame was open-ended. The umpire decided what the victory conditions were, if there were to be any, and they typically resembled the goals an actual army in battle might aim for. The emphasis was on the experience of decision-making and strategic thinking, not on competition. As Reisswitz himself wrote: \\"The winning or losing, in the sense of a card or board game, does not come into it.\\" In the English-speaking world, Reisswitz's wargame and its variants are called Kriegsspiel, which is the German word for \\"wargame\\". =German military wargaming (1824‚Äì1914)= Prussian officers playing Kriegsspiel (illustr. August 1872). Reisswitz showed his wargame to the Prussian king and his General Staff in 1824. They were greatly impressed. General Karl von Mueffling wrote: \\"It‚Äôs not a game at all! It's training for war. I shall recommend it enthusiastically to the whole army.\\" The king decreed that every regiment should play Kriegsspiel, and by the end of the decade every regiment had purchased materials for it.Vego (2012), German War Gaming, p. 110: \\"General Karl von Mueffling (1775‚Äì1851), chief of the general staff (1821‚Äì29) in Prussia, exclaimed, \\"It's not a game at all! It‚Äôs training for war. I shall recommend it enthusiastically to the whole army.\\" He fulfilled that promise: a royal decree directed every regiment in the Prussian army to play the game regularly. By the end of the 1820s each Prussian regiment was purchasing with state funds materials for war gaming.\\" By the 1850s it had become very popular in the army.Vego (2012), German War Gaming, p. 110: \\"By the 1850s the Kriegsspiel had gained great popularity in the German military and some interest in the militaries of other countries.\\" Kriegsspiel was therefore the first wargame to be treated as a serious tool of training and research by a military organization. Aside from official military venues, Kriegsspiel was also played in a number of private clubs around the country, which were mainly patronized by officers but also had civilian members, so Kriegsspiel was certainly being played in a recreational context. The first such club was the Berlin Wargame Association. In 1828, General von Moltke the Elder joined the Magdeburg Club and became its manager. Over the years, other officers updated Reisswitz's game to reflect changes in technology and doctrine. A particularly noteworthy variant was free Kriegsspiel, developed in 1876 by General Julius von Verdy du Vernois. Vernois was frustrated by the cumbersome rules of traditional rigid Kriegsspiel. They took a lot of time to learn and prevented experienced officers from applying their own expertise. The computations also slowed down the game; sometimes, a session would take longer to play than the actual battle it represented. Vernois advocated dispensing with the rules altogether and allowing the umpire to determine the outcomes of player decisions as he saw fit. Dice, rulers, computations, etc. were optional. This rules-free variant, of course, depended more heavily on the competence and impartiality of the umpire. The relative merits and drawbacks of rules-heavy and freeform wargaming are still debated to this day. =Wargaming spreads around the world= Prussian wargaming attracted little attention outside Prussia before 1870. Prussia was considered a second-rate power and wargaming an unproven novelty. That changed in 1870, when Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War. Many credited Prussia's victory to its wargaming tradition.Perla (1990), The Art of Wargaming:\\"In the aftermath of the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War, European and world military opinion suddenly became enamored of things German, including Kriegsspiel, to the use of which many experts attributed the German victories.\\" The Prussian army did not have any significant advantage in weaponry, numbers, or troop quality, but it was the only army in the world that practiced wargaming.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 278: \\"During the wars of German unification, Prussian wargaming appears to have provided a significant advantage. How else can Prussia‚Äôs lopsided victories be explained? Prussian forces were more often than not outnumbered, weapon advantages were mixed, and training methods were similar, though some think Prussia had an advantage in the education of staff officers. At this time, though, the Prussian military had a monopoly on second-generation wargaming and had integrated it into its staff education and its staff planning methods, especially at the higher levels.\\" Civilians and military forces around the world now took a keen interest in German military wargames, which foreigners referred to as Kriegsspiel (the German word for \\"wargame\\"). The first Kriegsspiel manual in English, based on the system of Wilhelm von Tschischwitz, was published in 1872 for the British army and received a royal endorsement.Peterson (2012), Playing At War The world's first recreational wargaming club was the University Kriegspiel [sic] Club, founded in 1873 at Oxford University in England. In the United States, Charles Adiel Lewis Totten published Strategos, the American War Game in 1880, and William R. Livermore published The American Kriegsspiel in 1882, both heavily inspired by Prussian wargames. In 1894, the US Naval War College made wargaming a regular tool of instruction.Perla (1990), The Art of Wargaming: \\"In 1894, under newly appointed President Captain Henry Taylor, gaming became an integral and permanent part of the course of study for all students.\\" =Wargaming at the US Naval War College (1919‚Äì1941)= A wargame at the US Naval War College. This photo was taken in the 1950s, but strongly resembles the wargames played in the 1930s. The US Naval War College is a staff college where American officers of all ranks go to receive postgraduate training. Since 1894, wargaming has been a regular tool of instruction there. Wargaming was brought to the Naval War College by William McCarty Little, a retired Navy lieutenant who had likely been inspired after reading The American Kriegsspiel by W.R. Livermore. Livermore was stationed nearby at Fort Adams, and he and Little cooperated to translate the ideas behind Kriegsspiel to naval warfare.Perla (1990), The Art of Wargaming: \\"Little's budding interest in wargaming was almost certainly stimulated by his association with army Major W. R. Livermore, author of The American Kriegsspiel, who was stationed across the harbor from the Naval War College in Fort Adams.\\" After World War I, the Navy suffered severe budget cuts that prevented it from upgrading and expanding its fleet. This limited its ability to conduct naval exercises. Wargaming thus became a vital means of testing hypothetical strategies and tactics.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 107: \\"This happened in spite of the assertion by the school that the wargames were not laboratories for war plan development. In reality they could not help but be, simply because of their ubiquity and their demonstrated potential to provide a low-cost way to exercise naval thought in an era of parsimony. The game represented one of the only ways that issues of pressing interest to the navy could be investigated in a systematic way...\\" Another problem was that by the time America entered World War 2 in 1941, none of the Navy's senior officers had any meaningful combat experience, but almost all of them had participated in wargames at the Naval War College.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 8: \\"In 1941 none of them had any meaningful naval combat experience, but almost every one of them had practiced tactics and strategy in the War College's wargame environment.\\" The fact that America defeated Japan in World War 2, despite these shortcomings, is strong evidence for the value of the wargaming. After the war, Admiral Nimitz said that the wargames predicted every tactic the Japanese used except for the kamikazes (a somewhat hyperbolic assertion).Chester Nimitz, in a speech at the US Naval War College, 10 October 1960.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 1 The Naval War College organized two broad classes of wargames: \\"chart maneuvers\\", which were strategic-level games; and \\"board maneuvers\\", which were tactical-level games. The chart maneuvers were about fleet movements, scouting and screening operations, and supply lines.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 47 The board maneuvers simulated battles in detail, with the aid of model ships. Most of the wargames were played on the floors of lecture halls, as they needed more space than any table could provide. The two most frequently played scenarios were a war with Japan and a war with Britain. Japan was code-named ORANGE, Britain was code-named RED, and America was code-named BLUE. Neither the students nor the staff at the Naval War College expected a war with Britain.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 45: \\"While lecture subjects and student diaries reflect awareness of the volatile situation in postwar Europe, none of these documents provide any indication that naval officers of the time ever imagined that the United States might go to war with England.\\" It's possible that the US Navy didn't imagine getting into any sort of serious naval conflict in the Atlantic with anyone, and that it simulated wars against Britain simply because it saw the Royal Navy as its role model.Vlahos (1980), The Blue Sword, p. 103, 107 A war with Japan, on the other hand, was a real concern, and as the years passed the wargames were increasingly played against ORANGE. In case of a war with Japan, the US Navy's grand strategy was to send an armada straight across the Pacific and quickly defeat the Japanese navy in one or two decisive battles.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 70: \\"This doctrine called for the U.S. Navy to steam directly across the central Pacific, engage the Japanese fleet in force, and defeat them as quickly as possible while the garrison defending the Philippines withdrew to the Bataan peninsula and fought a delaying action.\\" The wargamers at the College tested this strategy extensively, and it routinely failed. In 1933, the Navy's Research Department reviewed the wargames played from 1927 to 1933 and concluded that the fundamental problem was that the armada over-extended its supply lines. The BLUE armada would exhaust itself, and ORANGE would recover and counter- attack.Lillard (2016), Playing War, p. 105-106: \\"With the same basic results obtained despite experiments with different tactics, new ship types, and a variety of approach routes, commentary by the new Research Department reflected a growing realization that the thruster strategy was too costly for BLUE. At the same time, ORANGE, while in many cases suffering losses that were comparable to BLUE, usually ended the games in a better position to recover from those losses and mount a counterattack. After this, the wargamers at the College abandoned the old doctrine and instead developed a more progressive strategy, which involved building a logistics infrastructure in the western Pacific and making alliances with regional countries. By the mid-1930s, the wargames resembled very much what the Navy later experienced in the Pacific War.Lillard (2016), Playing War: \\"Game records from the period show that by the middle of the 1930s the students and staff were simulating a Pacific war very much like the one they ended up fighting in the 1940s.\\" The wargames also produced tactical innovations, most notably the \\"circular formation\\". In this formation, as it was used in World War 2, an aircraft carrier was surrounded by concentric circles of cruisers and destroyers. This formation concentrated anti-aircraft fire, and also was easier to maneuver than a line of battle because all the ships could turn at once with a signal from the central ship. The circular formation was first proposed in September 1922 by Commander Roscoe C. MacFall. Initially, the wargamers at the College used a battleship as the central ship, but this was eventually supplanted by the aircraft carrier. Chester Nimitz, who was a fellow student that same year, was impressed by what the circular formation could do, and Nimitz played a pivotal role in making it Navy doctrine.: \\"Recalled Nimitz afterward, \\"We were all impressed with the things you could do from a circular formation.\\" To Nimitz alone, however, fell the distinction of introducing the new formation to the fleet.\\" On the other hand, the wargamers at the Naval War College failed to develop good submarine doctrine. They didn't have a good understanding of what submarines could do. Unlike the German navy, the US Navy had no significant experience with submarine warfare. Most of the time, the players used submarines as a screening force that sailed ahead of the main formation. Players rarely used submarines in independent operations, and never to attack commercial shipping as German wargamers were doing at the time.Lillard (2016), Playing War: \\"Strategically, submarines were still something of an unknown quantity in interwar period navies. Only Germany had any significant experience in a submarine campaign...\\" =German wargaming after World War I= The Treaty of Versailles greatly restricted the size of Germany's armed forces and outright banned certain weapons such as planes, tanks, and submarines. This made it difficult if not impossible for the German military to develop their doctrines through field exercises. The Germans greatly expanded their use of wargaming to compensate, and between 1919 and 1939, the German military used wargaming more heavily than any other in the world.Vego (2012), German War Gaming, p. 114: \\"Between 1919 and 1939 the German military, more than any other, used war gaming as the main means for educating and training its officer corps. The reason was that the Versailles Treaty of 1919 put severe restrictions on Germany‚Äôs forces. Among other things, the size of the new German military, the Reichswehr, was put at a hundred thousand, including four thousand officers. The general staff was formally dissolved, although its main functions survived under different names. Tanks, aircraft, and U-boats were prohibited.\\" By the time Germany began openly rearming in 1934, its officers already had fairly well-developed theories on what armaments to buy and what organizational reforms to implement.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 282: \\"At a negligible incremental cost, Germany greatly increased the depth and scope of wargaming in its armed forces. This had the added benefit that when the armed forces were allowed to expand, buy new weapons, and activate new units (or did so anyway), they knew from their wargames what weapons and forces would have the greatest impact.\\" German wargaming at this time was restricted to tactical and operational-level play. Hitler discouraged strategic-level games, as he was confident enough in his own ability to make strategic judgments. Over the course of the war, Germany fought well at the tactical and operational level but made many bad strategic decisions.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 46 During World War 1, the British learned to protect their ships from German submarines by moving them in convoys which were escorted by submarine-hunting ships. The convoy system proved effective against German submarines, which typically operated alone. During the inter-war years, the German navy developed the \\"wolf-pack\\" doctrine by which German submarines would attack convoys in groups to confuse and overwhelm the escorts. These ideas were tested in a combination of wargames and naval exercises. Karl Doenitz, who would later command German submarine operations during World War 2, organized a series of wargames held during the winter of 1938-39, and from the results he concluded that it would be best for a wolf-pack attack to be coordinated by a designated command submarine rather than a commander onshore. He also concluded that Germany needed 300 submarines to effectively destroy British shipping, and that Germany's existing submarine fleet would at most inflict \\"pin-pricks\\".Vego (2012), German War Gaming, p. 120-121 After World War 2, wargaming ceased in Germany, as well as in the other Axis powers. Germany didn't even have an army until 1955, so they saw little need to wargame. When West Germany established its new army in 1955, they had so few officers with wargaming experience that the German War College asked the US Air Force to provide it an officer with wargaming experience.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 71 =British naval wargaming during World War II= WATU (1942). The male players on the right are looking through peepholes in a screen which hides the enemy board. In January 1942, the British Royal Navy established a naval tactical analysis unit called the Western Approaches Tactical Unit (WATU), which was tasked with developing ways to counter the German submarine \\"wolf-packs\\" that were devastating shipping convoys in the Atlantic. It was based in Liverpool, directed by Captain Gilbert Roberts, and staffed mainly by young women from the Women's Royal Naval Service. Their primary analytical tool was wargaming. The staff at WATU used wargames to test various hypothetical submarine tactics against virtual convoys, and if a certain tactic proved consistently effective and produced outcomes similar to what the actual convoys were reporting, WATU assumed that is what the Germans were in fact doing. The staff at WATU would then design counter-measures and test them in wargames. Once a tactic was perfected, it was disseminated in three ways: 1) They ran week-long courses where officers from the Royal Navy and allied foreign navies would play wargames at their headquarters in Liverpool; 2) They published them in manuals such as the Atlantic Convoy Instructions; 3) They would communicate new tactics directly to escort vessels at sea via radio. What makes WATU a remarkable episode in the history of wargaming is that they used wargames to analyzed scenarios that were occuring in an ongoing war, and developed solutions that were deployed immediately in the field. This is in contrast to wargames played during peacetime which investigate hypothetical scenarios. =Soviet Union= The Soviets inherited their wargaming techniques from tsarist officers, who favored the rigid form of wargaming pioneered by Reisswitz. Interestingly, the Soviets typically played wargames not on flat maps, but on three-dimensional model battlefields. Soviet wargames typically comprised only a single turn. The players would describe their plan to the umpires, who would then adjudicate the battle all the way to conclusion. This meant the players could not react to what the enemy was doing. This approach was optimal for decision- support but poor for developing the players' thinking skills.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 55: \\"The slow, detailed adjudication of these wargames that was optimal for decision support was poorly suited to developing the thinking skills of Soviet officers.\\"Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 61-62: \\"Soviet games typically centered on terrain models. Using each side‚Äôs plans for the entire mission, the umpires, using incredibly detailed and cumbersome procedures, would the adjudicate the operation all at once, all the way to its conclusion. Only then would the two teams be called back and walked through the operation, step by step. Essentially, these were one-move wargames.\\" Immediately after the end of World War 2, there was a precipitous drop in wargaming in armed forces all over the world. The exception was the Soviet Union. The Soviets actually expanded their wargaming and made them more rigorous.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 63: \\"Only inside the Soviet Union did wargaming expand and become more rigorous.\\" The Soviets launched a massive effort to compile data from the war on the Eastern Front to make their wargames more valid.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 78: \\"Even before the cessation of hostilities, they launched a massive effort to collect and compile operational data from their part of World War II, the ‚ÄúGreat Patriotic War,‚Äù to increase the validity of their wargaming.\\" During the Cold War, the Soviets allowed officers from other communist countries to attend its military schools, and wargaming was part of the curriculum. Using techniques learned in the Soviet Union, North Vietnamese officers wargamed their attacks against South Vietnam and her allies, and were able to coordinates complicated attacks without the need for radio communications by memorizing timetables.Caffrey (2019), On Wargaming, p. 85 =American wargaming during the Cold War= For a few years after the end of World War 2, wargaming almost ceased in America. At the Naval War College, wargaming dropped to about 10% of its pre-war level.Caffrey (2019). On Wargaming, p. 74: \\"...immediately after World War II, wargaming at the Naval War College dropped to about 10 percent of its prewar levels.\\" The Navy Electronic Warfare Simulator (1958). The first computerized wargaming system was the Navy Electronic Warfare Simulator, which became operational in 1958 at the US Naval War College. The computer system, being from the pre-microchip era, spanned three floors. The game rooms were designed to the resemble the command centers where the Navy coordinated its fleets.Peterson (2012). Playing At War: \\"An early and well-documented example is the ‚ÄúNavy Electronic Warfare Simulator,‚Äù or NEWS, conceived in 1945 and operational by 1958. Its four thousand miles of wire and thirteen thousand electronic tubes, marshaled across three floors of a building, at a cost of around US$10M exceeded the means of even the most enthusiastic hobby wargame clubs. Much of this cost reflected the sophistication of the facilities housing the players and umpires, which replicated command centers then in service to run a real-time game in the actual spaces of command.\\"Perla (1990), The Art of Wargaming: \\"The modernization plans laid in the late 1940s came to fruition in 1958 when the Navy Electronic Warfare Simulator, the NEWS, was commissioned. The NEWS occupied the three floors of the central wing of the War College's Sims Hall, and had taken thirteen years and $7.25 million to complete.\\" When the system was first made operational in 1958, the Navy discovered that it could not model recent advances in military technology. For instance, it could not model ships moving faster than 500 knots. The system had taken 13 years to develop and, like most computers from that era, was difficult to reprogram or upgrade (it predated punch-cards). A variety of improvisational gimmicks were required to run wargames for the contemporary era.Perla (1990). The Art of Wargaming: \\"Unfortunately, from the day it first came on line NEWS suffered from several limitations. It had originally been conceived of as little more than a fancy modern update of the game board (one of its preliminary names had been the Electronic Maneuver Board System), and this ancestry showed all too clearly. [...] To get around these limitations, a whole host of \\"scaling factors and other gimmicks\\" were developed.\\" References =Footnotes= =Bibliography= (translation by Bill Leeson, 1989)       Category:Wargames Category:Military exercises and wargames ","title":"Military wargaming"},{"id":"61222827","text":"Crows in the Rain is an Iranian post-rock band which was formed in Tehran in 2014. It is among the first post-rock bands in Iran. After their first album was released, they became popular as the first Iranian ambient post-rock band. They were also known as ‚ÄúThe Crows‚Äù. The band's music is a blend of post-rock and neo-classical style. Indeed, the core of the band consists of Masih Taj (Electric Guitar, Piano), Hamed Fahimi Jou (Electric Guitar), Ashkan Karimi (Bass Guitar), who had been intimate friends for many years before the band was formed. One of the characteristics of Crows In The Rain is that the lead guitar and rhythm guitar are swirling in a different way between Masih Taj and Hamed Fahimi Ju. History =Band Formation: 2014-2015= Crows in the Rain Logo In the fall of 2014, Hamed and Masih shared their dreams about composing music together. Accordingly, the basic foundations of the Crows In The Rain band were built. The band was named on the basis of what happened in the first jamming between the two. In a rainy afternoon, when Hamed and Masih were playing a tune together, they succeeded at making their first track after a few hours. After they listened to their first track, they named it ‚ÄúThe Rain‚Äù under the influence of weather conditions. At the same time and in a random manner, they noticed the presence of a large circle of crows in the rainy sky. So, they named the track and the band ‚ÄúCrows In The Rain‚Äù. After that, they decided to compose more songs and form their feelings and ideas. Therefore, several tracks were created a few months later, such as ‚ÄúForgotten Childhood‚Äù, ‚ÄúDreaming‚Äù, and ‚ÄúYou Were There‚Äù. They uploaded them on the internet. According to the members of the band, so many tracks were created in that period but they were not released. After that period, the band decided to collect an album and worked on the tracks for a while. Since spring 2015, they began to work on the album. In summer 2015, they released one of the album tracks as a single track. The finalization of the album lasted until the beginning of winter 2015. Eventually, the first album of ‚ÄúThe Crows‚Äù was released in February 2016. =You Are Dying in My Arms: 2015-2016= The name of the first album of Crows In The Rain is ‚ÄúYou are Dying in my Arms‚Äù. The album's genre is Ambient and Neo-classical. According to The Crows‚Äô interview, the first album was just about the band's Inner voices. In fact, no other factor was taken into account but emotions, and The Crows were looking for their inner status. In order to form the album through dozens of tracks, ten tracks were selected. The basis for this selection was a feeling about their lost friend. According to the band members, the loss of a friend was an excuse to understand the main concept of the songs, and that feeling is a sense of distance and separation that all the people may have experienced within themselves. After their first album was released, the tracks were greeted by the audience and quickly shared. The first album tells a story that was composed in many chapters. ‚ÄúIt was 2016 Chaharshanbe Suri that we started composing instead of celebrating, and the result was the track of ‚ÄúTrust the Universe‚Äù. the reason for the track denomination was that it was a sentence widely used by our lost friend, and because she loved the track, that name was chosen for this piece,‚Äù Hamad and Masih said. Hamed and Masih Performing in 2017 - Shiraz Another track of this album was named ‚ÄúI am not the body; I am not even the mind‚Äù. Members of the band are used to meditating before improvising playing each tune and this track was created just after a deep and specific meditation. The track ‚ÄúPlease be well, Is it too late?‚Äù was played and denominated under the influence of the song ‚ÄúHorses in the Sky‚Äù composed by the Canadian band ‚ÄúThee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra‚Äù. Another track in the album is called ‚ÄúYou Are Dying in My Arms‚Äù. This track was anonymous at the beginning and the album was supposed to be called ‚ÄúTrust the Universe‚Äù. While naming the track, one of the best friends of the band's members suggested this name. At the very moment, the album was named after this due to its meaning and emotional connotation. The track ‚ÄúThe End‚Äù is one of the final tracks of the album. The track, according to Hamed and Masih, indicates the peak feeling of loneliness and isolation we have experienced from within. =Little Girl and Lost Blossom : 2016-2017= The band continues to take a more serious look at its future after releasing the first album and its resulted in working on their second album. The second album was also warmly welcomed by the audience and their fans. The genre of the album is rather Neo- classical and ambient. The album was formed in spring 2017. The album was unveiled and released quite informally. The unveiling of this album was performed differently and on Valiasr street (one of the major and well-known streets in Tehran) with the presence of the audience and fans of the band. Crows in the Rain Live Performance - Hamed , Ashkan and Masih ( from left to right ) - 2019 The albums‚Äô idea formation and release started at the point that, according to the members of the band, this album was the result of an astounding journey. The Crows spent 24 hours outside the house on a different journey and spent 12 hours in nature alone. The experience they gained in 12 hours and what happened to the Crows led to the formation of the main story of the second album. It was a metaphysical and inorganic experience, so that a year after the journey, all the tracks made by the band was influenced by that 12 hours and all its strange experiences. The tracks in the album express unique concepts and names. With regard to this, the Crows say: In fact, the Fatherland was the land we journeyed to in our special experience, and there were extraterrestrial beings that we felt their presence, and so we named the land ‚Äúthe Fatherland‚Äù. ‚ÄúLittle girl and lost blossom‚Äù is the story of one of those creatures in part of that land called the ‚ÄúSecond Death‚Äù, and the expression of her grief and sadness. The track ‚Äú... (For a Film)‚Äù tells the story of the moment when the band is saying goodbye to the little girl in their minds and leaves the land of Second Death. This track was collected in the very first year by Morego Dimma under the label ‚ÄúUnexplored sounds group‚Äù, and was released under the English label ‚ÄúCold Spring‚Äù in the form of the album ‚ÄúVisions of Darkness (Iranian Contemporary Music)‚Äù. =Ashes of the Past: 2017-2018= The album ‚ÄúAshes of the past‚Äù has had a stylish leap over the past two albums. The album's genre is post-rock. Adding the bass and the drums to another style, the band seems to have moved toward the core of the post-rock style. In this album, the style of the band‚Äôs jammings from home jamming to studio jamming and with the addition of new instruments has taken a different form. Like the previous two albums, this album was unofficially released, as well. The unveiling ceremony of the album took place at a local caf√© named Kafeh Aparteman (Caf√© Apartment) in Tehran in May 2017. In winter 2017, Ashkan as the bassist and Amir Hossein as the drummer joined the Crows In The Rain band. The Crows decided to go on the stage for the first time in 2017, sharing their feeling through live music with their audience. They worked on their third album until fall 2017. Before their album was officially released, they held their first concert at the Koral Music School Hall (Hamdelan) by playing some pieces from the third album for the first time in November 2017. Twenty-four days later, the second performance of the Crows, as well as the first and largest official post-rock in Iran, took place in Azadi Tower Hall. Crows in the Rain - Live at Azadi Tower Hall - 2018 The Crows decided to release their third album in January 2018, but it did not happen because of some issues. In the meantime, they staged a concert in Shiraz in two sequences, at the ‚ÄúKian black box artistic and cultural complex‚Äù. When they returned to Tehran, the Crows were invited to a conference in the 900-seat auditorium of Tehran University, where they performed two of their third and non-published album. In the same year, as a guest band, they were invited to participate in the festival opening ceremony and set off on stage. In March 2018, they performed their dedicated performance in Koral Academy Arena. The album ‚ÄúAshes of the past‚Äù consists of 11 pieces. This album was released with Italian label \\"Hortus Conclusus Records\\". The first piece of the album is called ‚ÄúBeyond the Flying Mountains‚Äù. Beyond the Flying Mountains was built after the first jammings with new instruments and a different style. The Crows In The Rain band now has reached a point where they acknowledged that they can express what has been engraved in their minds since the beginning in the form of music. The track marked the beginning of the album and served as a milestone for the band‚Äôs style transformation into the post-rock, the same post-rock style already imagined in the minds of all the band‚Äôs members. ‚ÄúRequiem for a Dreamer‚Äù is the name of another piece of the album. The track was initially ignored by the band, but after all the members of the band listened to it again, they decided to finalize it and put it in the album. The important thing about the track is that the band shows its internal grief and sorrow in a different atmosphere. According to the members of the band, the track is the sentiments of a dreamer who cannot dream anymore. ‚ÄúI will build the future on the past of the memories‚Äù was the last studio track of the album to be created. The reason for the track denomination was that the band members reached a consensus to leave the past with all its sadness and grief behind and start to build up the future from its ashes. The dreamer is dreaming again on his own ashes in this position. =Sorrow for an Unfinished Dream : 2018-2019= ‚ÄúSorrow for an Unfinished Dream‚Äù is the fourth album and the third studio album by the Crows In The Rain band. It is the first dependent official album by the band in Iranian market. The album‚Äôs style is Neo- classical and post-rock. The album is an epitome of the combination of the last three albums of the Crows In The Rain and may be called a pure extract from the nature of the Crows In The Rain band. After their second and third albums were released, the Crows attempted to perform musical improvisation with more experience and skill, and the result was the beginning of the fourth album. Over the past few years, certain tracks have been made by the band, and the tracks are being played in a diverse manner, combined with the last two albums in the band concerts. Over time, new tracks were made and added to the playlist. The Crows In The Rain band had a performance in two sequences in Shiraz in August 2018, at the ‚ÄúKian black box artistic and cultural complex‚Äù, where they played some tracks from the album of the ‚ÄúAshes of the past‚Äù as well as the fourth album. Five months later, they were re-performing at ‚ÄúAzadi Tower Hall‚Äù. After a little while, they had another performance at ‚ÄúEyvan-e Shams Hall‚Äù. The unveiling ceremony of the band‚Äôs fourth album was held after the live performance of the band at the Niavaran Cultural Center in spring 2019, with the band‚Äôs extensive audience and fans. After the unveiling ceremony of the album was held, the album's first music video was released, which was warmly welcomed by the fans and critics. The band also unveiled the album in the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz, Kerman, and Rasht. Crows in the Rain Live at Niavaran Cultural Center - 2019 While making the songs, the band began to realize that the concept of tracks created is closely related to the concepts of the tracks created in advance that have not been published to date. As a result, the old tracks were added to the new tracks, resulting in the formation of the fourth album, which may be called the most sophisticated and successful album by the Crows In The Rain band. The album consists of 10 studio albums. Two years prior to the album's release, the earlier lines of the track ‚ÄúThis is our cry‚Äù had been written. It was in the band's archive. While naming the rest of the album‚Äôs tracks, this track came into account accidentally, and this was a turning point for forming the concept of the album. In the process of composing the album, the track ‚ÄúUnfinished Dream of Sadako‚Äù was the last track which was made. According to the band members, when the track was made, we felt that the album was finished and had completed its mission. Here there were signs such as paper cranes, origami and the story of Sadako Sasaki. The band came to the conclusion that the story of Sadaku Sasaki was very close to what the band was trying to express in the album. Consequently, the track was named ‚ÄúUnfinished Dream of Sadako‚Äù. It is the ensign and the main mask of the album. The band‚Äôs first music video is also derived from the same track. The general concept seen in the band‚Äôs fourth album is unrealized dreams. It may be said that the main message of the Crows In The Rain band is the same unrealized dreams. The signs of this concept can be observed from the second single track called ‚ÄúDreaming‚Äù in the first year of band formation to the last album. In this vein, another track of the fourth album is ‚ÄúThe Legend of the Cranes‚Äù. The track is more reminiscent of the track ‚ÄúYou are Dying in My Arms‚Äù for the band. It represents the grandeur of the effort to fight for dreams and hope for unrealized dreams. ‚ÄúNow you can sleep‚Äù is the last track of the album, which has a different story from the rest of the songs. Masih‚Äôs grandmother laid on her deathbed, suffering from insomnia. When she heard the track, she could sleep after a few days of sleeplessness. After a little while, as soon as the band was performing in Shiraz, Masih‚Äôs grandmother died a few hours before the performance. The band states that after this, we discovered that this track, with all its incidents, is the best ending for the album. Musical style Although the band‚Äôs musical style has undergone changes since the band has started working, it has a different style in ambient/post-rock. that has been shaped by the Crows In The Rain. The formation of the band‚Äôs musical taste has been adapted from a combination of the musical taste of Masih and Hamad. The musical style Masih was listening to and playing was Neo-Classical, New Age, and Meditation. On the other hand, the musical style Hamed was listening to and playing was Rock and Metal. The blend of these two tastes has been the basis for the formation of the band‚Äôs style at the beginning of their work. In the second album, after Hamed was more into the classical music, the album‚Äôs atmosphere became more ambient. In the third album, where Ashkan and Amir Hossein joined the band as bassist and drummer, the style of the band approached the main goal of the Crows In The Rain band, which could be called the pure post-rock. In addition to this, the presence of the jazz taste background of the band‚Äôs drummer caused the third album to have the elements of the jazz music whose signs can be seen in the fourth album and especially in the track ‚Äúa scintilla of hope‚Äù. In the fourth album, the maximum coordination can be observed among the members of the band, resulting in the combination of the styles of the last three albums and the band‚Äôs movement towards reaching the ideal style they opted for.

The site was built by SmithKline Beecham, which became GSK in December 2000 when it merged with Glaxo Wellcome. The site was the UK headquarters of SmithKline Beecham; Glaxo had a takeover of Wellcome in 1995. SmithKline Beecham employed 47,000 staff around the world, with 8,200 in the UK. Jan Leschly (a Danish tennis player) was chief executive of SmithKline Beecham from 1994 to 2000. SmithKline Beecham exported ¬£1.2bn of products.

History and application The faithless service doctrine is a very old common law doctrine that springs out of agency law.Manning Gilbert Warren III (2010). \\"Equitable Clawback: An Essay on Restoration of Executive Compensation,\\" 12 University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business Law 1135.Frank J Cavico, Bahaudin G Mujtaba, Stephen Muffler. (2018). \\"The Duty of Loyalty in the Employment Relationship: Legal Analysis and Recommendations for Employers and Workers,\\" Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues, Vol. 21, Issue 3. It is a doctrine under the laws of a number of states in the United States, and most notably New York State law, pursuant to which an employee who acts unfaithfully towards his or her employer must forfeit all of the compensation received during the period of disloyalty. Application in New York State In a case from the 19th century that is still referred to today, Murray v. Beard, 7 N.E. 553, 554-55 (N.Y. 1886), the New York Court of Appeals held that a broker could not recover commissions from his employer, holding that \\"An agent is held to uberrima fides in his dealings with his principal; and if he acts adversely to his employer in any part of the transaction ... it amounts to such a fraud upon the principal, as to forfeit any right to compensation for services.\\" In Astra USA v. Bildman, 914 N.E.2d 36 (Mass. 2009), applying New York's faithless servant doctrine, the court held that a company's employee who had engaged in financial misdeeds and sexual harassment must \\"forfeit all of his salary and bonuses for the period of disloyalty.\\" The court held that this was the case even if the employee \\"otherwise performed valuable services,\\" and that the employee was not entitled to recover restitution for the value of those other services. The decision attracted a good deal of attention by legal commentators. Similarly, in Morgan Stanley v. Skowron, 989 F. Supp. 2d 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), the leading case by a New York federal district court applying New York's faithless servant doctrine in Manhattan in the Southern District of New York, United States District Judge Shira Scheindlin held that a hedge fund's employee engaging in insider trading in violation of his company's code of conduct, which also required him to report his misconduct, must repay his employer the full $31 million his employer paid him as compensation during his period of faithlessness. Judge Scheindlin called the insider trading the \\"ultimate abuse of a portfolio manager's position.\\" The judge also wrote: \\"\\"In addition to exposing Morgan Stanley to government investigations and direct financial losses, Skowron's behavior damaged the firm's reputation, a valuable corporate asset.\\" The doctrine was applied as well in Mahn v. Major, Lindsey, & Africa, 2018 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 1713 (1st Dep‚Äôt Mar. 20, 2018), which involved a legal recruiter accused of disseminating proprietary information to competitors in return for kickbacks, who was required to pay back her employer more than $2.7 million. Application in other states The faithless servant doctrine has also been applied by courts in the states of California, Maryland, Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, and Oregon.Robert B. Fitzpatrick. Courts in other states have chosen to apply the doctrine in part, while Connecticut, Florida, and Rhode Island have chosen not to adopt the doctrine.

Currently in good condition and located at its original site, it was designed by architect Alfredo Wiechers Pieretti and built by Salvador Lando, in 1915, for the Vendrell-Su√°rez family. The architect who was a native of Ponce, had studied in Paris, and won a gold medal for his achievements in 1905. He graduated in 1905 and worked in Barcelona with Eric Sangier until 1911. Villa Julita is a mansion built of wood with some of its facade in concrete: the colonnade, the stairway and the balustrade. These elements give it a neoclassical look to what is a Creole style structure, following in the tradition of haciendas and summer houses of the time. In 1917, the residence was sold to the Wirshing Serrall√©s family. In 1950, the Ulrich Foundation allowed it to host conscientious objectors of the wars of Korea and Vietnam. The Mennonite Foundation bought the property in 1972 and used this land to carry out instruction and guidance to farmers. The Mennonites are responsible for introducing modern methods for the mass production of fruits and plants, as well as artificial insemination techniques for livestock. Harry Nussbaum and Linda Ulrich, the current owners purchased it in 1974 and spent four years restoring it. It is now a children's preschool. Villa Julita maintains its elegance and serves as a testimony to a time when Aibonito was a favorite summer holiday for well-to-do families.

He was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School, and read music at University College, Oxford, graduating in 1974. After a stint as a freelance conductor and arranger, Brand worked as a producer for BBC Radio from 1979. During his BBC tenure, he produced BBC Radio 2 programmes, including those presented by David Hamilton, Brian Matthew, and Ray Moore. He left the BBC in 1982 to devote himself fully to his music.  Composing  Many of his compositions are published by the firm of G & M Brand Publications, which he runs with his father, Geoffrey. His Chosen Gems for Winds featured on a Naxos CD of music primarily by Percy Grainger, conducted by Bjarte Engeset. Together with his wife Jane Bramwell he is a founder and director of the non-profit Oxford Music Theatre. He composed the musicals \\"King & Country\\" (2014; based on Allan Moorhouse's 1923 play The Conquering Hero) and \\"CLD: The Real Lewis Carroll\\" (2016; in which Lewis Carroll meets his alter ego Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), and \\"Guilty of Love\\" (2017; about Alan Turing), each with lyrics by Bramwell. The reviewer Tim Bano, writing in The Stage, said of \\"CLD\\": \\"Brand's music has a contemporary hymnal quality, the jaunty piano melodies of modern church music\\".

It starts in the tunnel at the lower level of the Schlo√überg lift, which is accessible from Schlo√übergplatz.  History  During the World War II, the tunnels of the Schlo√überg, built in 1937, served as a haven from air raids for 40,000 people from 1943 onwards. The extensive long tunnel system with 20 entrances offered protection to the inhabitants of the city.Barbara Stelzl-Marx (Ludwig Boltzmann-Institut f√ºr Kriegsfolgen-Forschung): Der Grazer Schlo√übergstollen. In the post-war period, the air raid tunnels were initially no longer used, until the first Fairytale Grotto Railway was established in 1968 in a section of the tunnel system, which was accessible via an entrance in the Wickenburggasse. Ten years later, the business was temporarily closed-down, and the Fairytale Grotto Railway was out of service for four years. The railway was reopened in 1982. From 1984, the passable track was extended and the entrance relocated to the Schlo√übergplatz. The necessary construction work was supported by the private Mining and Railway Museum, which stores its heritage rail vehicles in the tunnels since 1984 but is not yet accessible for the general public. The train operation was converted to electricity and the gallery walls were secured with shotcrete. At that time, many plastic dolls were displayed in the tunnels of the castle hill, which represented 34 fairytales such as Snow White. The trip took at that time about 20 to 25 minutes on the long track with gauge. DC-powered electric locomotives like the locomotive Heinz 1 hauled trains with ten cars built in 1968 at a speed of on a track with eight points. Up to 20 passengers could ride in the old Fairytale Grotto Railway. In 1997, the worn tracks were completely renewed during the construction of the Schlo√überglift and the venue Dom im Berg, with a track change from 500 to 600 mm gauge. In 1999, the railway was reopened, but was closed in 2000 due to the tightened safety regulations after the fire of the Kaprun disaster and taken over by the city of Graz. After implementing extensive health and safety features, the railway resumed operation at the end of 2011. From early 2012 to November 2014, the fairy tale grotto railway was redesigned. The required renovation of the tunnel and the train was partially required, because of the amended legal provisions, which were much more complex than originally expected. Two thirds of the costs of 1.6 million Euros were spent on the renovation of the mining tunnel. The Graz Children's Museum FRida & freD was commissioned to redesign the content. On 14 November 2014, it was officially opened under the new name Grazer M√§rchenbahn (Fairy Tale Express Graz).  Route  Each of the two electrically driven trains passes a total of 22 stations and stops at 10 of these, so that the passengers can illuminate the exhibits with their flashlights during the approximately 35-minute journey: * Otherworld (short stopover) * Horse-drawn carriage * Old witch's land (short stopover) * Meadow of flowers * Giant feet (short stopover) * Autumn * Fairy tale forest (interactive stop) * Robber's cave * Treasure cave (interactive stop) * Flight * Oriental wye (interactive stop and reversal point) * Thunderstorms * Water * Ice world (interactive stop) * Stones - Metamorphosis (interactive stop) * Mirror * Spring (passing loop) * Food * Thorn hedge (interactive stop) * Headgear * Guard * Ballroom (interactive stop)  Exhibition concept  The modern concept of the Fairy Tale Express Graz is not without controversy,Grazer M√§rchenbahn auf Tripadvisor. but it intends to offer both children from 4 years and above as well as adults an equally impressive experience, instead of presenting the fairy tale contents just by animated dolls as in earlier years. The fairy tale world was carefully staged, whereby the figures and fairy tale contents are not explicitly represented. The collage of light and darkness, drive and standstill as well as the stimulating comments and fairy tale quotes allow a variety of associations in the coolness of the dark tunnel, leaving as much freedom as possible to the passengers' imagination.Mirjam Marits: Hinein in den Stollen, zur√ºck in die Kindheit. Die Presse, 10 January 2015. The train ride runs through some very dark tunnels, in which both young children and claustrophobic grown-ups could get scared. The temperature inside the tunnel is approximately 8‚Äì12 ¬∞C all year round, which requires appropriate clothing.

An analysis of the ‚Äògoing-concern assumption‚Äô: Text mining from Japanese financial reports. Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting 6: 1‚Äì16. The acronym SAF stands for Simple Analysis of Failure. The SAF2002 model was developed by analyzing the financial data of 1,436 bankrupt companies and 3,434 non-bankrupt companies extracted by a systematic sampling method from 107,034 companies. The variables for the model were selected by using a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) type of decision tree learning approach to analyze the financial data of Japanese companies that entered bankruptcy between 1992 and 2001. The four variables of the model that the CART approach identified are: (x_1) Retained Earnings to Total Liabilities and Owners‚Äô Equity, (x_2) Net Income Before Tax to Total Liabilities and Owners‚Äô Equity, (x_3) Inventory Turnover Period, and (x_4) Interest Expenses to Sales. Based on a linear model, which exhibited the most stable and discriminant results, the model's SAF value for each firm is based on the following equation: :SAF = 0.01036x_1 + 0.02682x_2 + 0.06610x_3 + 0.02368x_4 + 0.70773 A SAF value of 0.7 or below quickly raises a firm's bankruptcy risk.

Shortly following his death, Scotland Yard detectives announced that Murray was most likely a serial killer who murdered at least seven other previous wives, prior to the mass murder that became known as The Eastbourne Tragedy. Early career Much of Murray's early life, including his place and date of birth, are unknown. He had many fictitious names, posing as an American captain named Charles Stirling, claiming to have served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the Philippines and to have received a medal of honor from Congress for his part. As Robert Hicks Murray, he told residents of Clapham that he was a captain in the Royal Scots Greys, and in his past, as part of the Seaforth Highlanders, he had served as an enlisted soldier in both India and China. According to a sister of his future wife Florence Paler, while stationed in India, Murray suffered from a sunstroke, and from then on had bouts of insomnia and depression. Meeting the Palers In the beginning of 1908, Murray got acquainted with James Paler, a wealthy railway official living on the Isle of Wight. He was invited to the Paler home, where he met Florence (20) and Edith Paler (17), the unmarried daughters of James. Both sisters became enamored with the dashing young captain, with Murray wooing and secretly marrying Florence in a traditional Scottish ceremony. When she was about to give birth, he sent Florence away to a cottage in Clapham, where the child, christened Stanley, was born. Six months after Stanley's birth, Robert married the younger sister Edith in a Clapham church, moving in with her on Fawe Park Road in Putney. Each week, Murray spent three days with one and three with the other wife, and on the seventh, pretended to be unmarried. His absences were explained with his service in the army. In the period between 1910 and 1911, both wives gave birth to a single child: Edith to Winifred, and Florence to Vera. The Eastbourne Tragedy At some point, Murray was enfatuated with a young girl, the daughter of a wealthy tea merchant. After many tries, and after almost marrying her, Murray decided he must get rid of his families first. In order to do that, he announced to both families that they were going on a vacation in Eastbourne, much to the delight of his wives and little Stanley. Murray rented a large and beautiful villa in the outskirts of Eastbourne on Enys Road on 17 August 1912, bringing Edith and the 1-year-old Winifred first. Luring them to a room painted entirely in blue, he killed both her and the child, and left the bodies on the floor before locking the door. He then fetched Florence and her two children, bringing them to the villa, but warning them to never enter the \\"blue room\\". Two days later, in the early morning, Murray asked the sleepy Florence if she would like a cup of tea. She agreed, but when her husband returned, instead of tea, he was carrying a revolver. Robert shot her in the neck and, suspecting that she was dead, turned the weapon upon the children, killing them both. In the meantime, Florence, who was actually still alive, managed to escape the home and cry out for help. By this time, Murray had unlocked the blue room and carried Edith and Winifred's bodies to Stanley and Vera's, piling them together, soaking them in petrol and setting them alight. He then left ¬£160 and a note in a silver vase outside the house, confessing that he was ruined, wanted to take out everybody dependent on him and asking for forgiveness from God. He then pulled out his revolver and shot himself. Aftermath Firemen quickly arrived on the scene, managing to put out the flames before the bodies could be burned. Murray's confession note was located, as well as a badly burned Victoria Cross being located in the villa. The victims were identified as Edith Mathilda Murray, her child Vera, Florence's children Stanley and Winifred Florence Murray, and their killer - the husband and father, Robert Hicks Murray. It was quickly revealed that Murray had married both sisters, and all of the children were his, keeping this secret from both families. While investigating Murray's past, detectives from Scotland Yard announced that he had most likely murdered at least seven previous wives, but refused to reveal any further details. =Connection to Robert Henry Money= On 12 September 1912, Scotland Yard sent a letter to Inspector Miles, informing him that the man was positively identified as Robert Henry Money, whose sister Mary Money was murdered in 1905. When shown a picture of him, Florence, who was residing in Princess Alice Hospital, recognized him as her husband Robert. A resident of Kingston Hill, London, Money had five brothers and four sisters, and once had a business partnership with one of his brothers in Kingston, working as a builder in Hampden, Norbiton and other areas. After selling his business in April 1911, however, he kept little contact with his family, except with one sister, Mrs. Frith, whom he paid frequent visits. Inspector Fox had had conversations with Money, as he had previously been investigated in his sister's death, although he wasn't considered a good suspect. The identification was considered a doubtful one, especially by one of Robert's brothers, Alfred. Since it could not be conclusively connected, it is unclear if Murray and Money were the same person.

Wright-Peterson, chronicling the individual contributions of professional women who helped establish and develop the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Covering a period of 60 years, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota worked in conjunction with the Mayo family to open a hospital that would accept patients of all faiths. Beginning with a 27-bed facility, the women physicians and other medical professionals would eventually serve in theaters of war, and create an environment that evolved according to patient needs. Wright-Peterson is a faculty member of the University of Minnesota Rochester, and a former Mayo Clinic administrator. Synopsis Disaster struck Rochester, Minnesota on August 21, 1883, when an estimated-F5 tornado devastated the area. With the exception of facilities in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, the state of Minnesota only had three hospitals. Rochester had no medical facilities at that time. Mother Mary Alfred Moes of the Sisters of St. Francis assisted doctors William Mayo and his two sons, William (Dr. Will) and Charles, in caring for the victims. The devastation highlighted the need for a hospital in the Rochester area. The Mayo family and the Sisters of St. Francis worked conjointly to establish a facility open to all without regard to religious affiliation. Dr. William Mayo selected the site, with he and his sons touring hospitals for architectural concepts to best suit their vision. Mother Alfred raised $40.000, and supervised the construction. Initially named St. Mary's Hospital when it opened in 1889, it would eventually become part of the Mayo Clinic after the latter's founding in 1892. The hospital was small by modern standards, only 27 beds. The facility's first nurse and anesthesiologist Edith Graham, was hired and trained in the operating room by Dr. William Mayo. She in turn trained the Sisters as operating room nurses, and would eventually marry Dr. Charles Mayo. Sisters Sienna Otto, Constantine Koupal, Fidelis Cashion, Hyacinth Quinlan, Fabian Halloran, and Sylvester Burke attended to the needs of the patients 24/7, doing double duty as surgical assistants. Sister Joseph (Julia Dempsey) served in a dual capacity as hospital administrator and Dr. Will's surgical assistant. The hospital hired without regard to gender. Dr. Gertrude Booker Granger became the hospital's first woman physician in 1898. Physicians Harriet Preston and Ida Clarke were soon added. Nurse Alice Magaw oversaw the anesthesiology department. Dr. Isabella Herb of the Augustana Hospital in Chicago was brought in to organize the pathology department, the first female specialist in her field. Taking over the lab work previously done by the physicians themselves, she was assisted by the third generation of the Mayo family, granddaughters Daisy Berkman and Helen Berkman. The Mayo had no functional library when Maud Mellish Wilson joined as director of publications in 1907. Put in charge of new acquisitions, and preserving papers written by the Mayo doctors, she taught the staff in research practices, and presentation methods. She married the clinic's chief of pathology Louis B. Wilson, and they anonymously wrote Sketch of the History of the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Foundation. In 1909, she instituted publishing of the annual The Collected Papers of the Mayo Clinic. In 1929, she published the instructional guide The Writing of Medical Papers. Mabel Root became part of the team in 1907, organizing the system for physician records keeping, adding color coding and number assignment to facilitate ease of use. Four months before the 1914 outbreak of World War I, the Mayo moved to a new building in Rochester. Dr. Gertrude Granger became deputy director of public health. Dr. Leda Stacy was given her own area where she would establish radium therapy. Dutch pathologist Dr. Georgine Luden was added to the staff during this period . Maud Mellish Wilson began hiring more women photographers for the art studio. After the outbreak of war, the Mayo Clinic deployed teams of nurses to the war front. St. Mary's Nursing School graduate Florence Bullard joined the Red Cross, and was assigned to Evacuation Hospital 13. Continuing there through 1919, Bullard was the first American woman to be recognized by the French government for bravery, receiving the Croix de guerre and bronze star. In 1915, Doctors Charlie and Will Mayo donated $1.5 million to the University of Minnesota, to foster a program allowing the clinic's doctors to earn master's and doctoral degrees. One of the first graduates was pathologist Della Drips, specializing in gynecologic endocrinology. During the Spanish flu pandemic, Sister Joseph and the Sisters of Saint Francis purchased the nearby Lincoln Hotel and converted it into an isolation hospital in October 1917. By May 1918, when the menace had run its course, 360 patients had been hospitalized and 41 had died. What there was in the way of social services at the Mayo had been provided at the registration desk by Willa Murray and Cora Olson. Ida Maud Cannon, chief of social services at Massachusetts General Hospital, began training candidates for a new direction in the Mayo's services. Charlotte Bundy was the first to accept the challenge of the clinic's social work . With support from the Mayo, Bundy and nursing student Isabella Gooding set up their practice at the Colonial Hospital. After Bundy married and moved to Scotland, Priscilla Keely became the director. The unit began surveying patients to learn the diverse needs. Services such as a lending library, financial assistance, occupational therapy, and a language interpreter were considered part of the holistic healing of the patient. Cuban-born Beatriz Montes was hired as a language interpreter for Spanish-speaking patients. After being selected by Sister Joseph at a chance meeting on a hospital tour, Anna Jamme was trained as a nurse. She would later institute the Saint Marys School of Nursing, and become its first administrator. Graduating from the school in 1918, Sister Domitilla, born Lillian DuRocher became hospital administrator in 1939. United States Army medical corp veteran Mary Foley worked at the diet kitchen at the Kahler Corporation, when she became acquainted with Dr. Will Mayo. He hired her for the Mayo, where she instituted the dietetics program for outpatients. Anatomical sculptor Nellie Starkson created presentation 3D wax anatomical images. During her time at the Mayo, pathologist Winifred Ashby developed the Ashby technique for determining red blood cell survival. Sister Joseph, who retired as a surgical assistant in 1915, and the Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, had financed hospital expansions in 1894, 1898, 1904, 1909, 1912 and 1922. Between the year years 1913 and 1914, the patient load increased 2600%. A new surgical building, complete with amphitheater for student procedures viewing, opened on Florence Nightingale‚Äôs birthday in 1922. Another new building was added in 1928. Over the ensuing years, the patient load has continued to rise, as have the opportunities for women in the medical profession.
