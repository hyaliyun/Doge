The goal is to make teaching material and reform the economics curriculum. Its textbook is taught as an introductory course at more than 300 universities. It provides its materials online, at no cost to users. It is registered as a charity (CORE Economics Education) in England and Wales. Origins CORE was conceived in late 2012, by Professors Wendy Carlin of University College London, Samuel Bowles of the Santa Fe Institute, and , who at that time was Director of the School of Economics and Business of the University of Chile. At the time, Professor Carlin wrote to colleagues to suggest they collaborate to revise the curriculum, noting that \\"altering the course of the undergraduate curriculum is like turning around a half a million ton super tanker. But I think that the time may be right for the initiative I am inviting you to join me in proposing.\\" Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, students had formed groups, such as the International Student Initiative for Pluralist Economics (ISIPE) and Rethinking Economics, to demand improvements to the mainstream economics curriculum. ISIPE, for example, argued that \\"teaching in economics departments is too narrowly focused and more effort should be made to broaden the curriculum\\". Professor Carlin has written that: > \\"The textbook model is definitely broken. In it, economic actors are amoral > and self-interested, perfectly competitive market prices equate supply to > demand implementing “optimal” outcomes, while environmental degradation, > instability, and inequality are afterthoughts at best … Yet it continues as > the backbone of much undergraduate teaching. However remote from what > economists really do and the way we think, this is the “economics” imprinted > on the public’s mind.\\" Launched in October 2013 at HM Treasury, CORE said its mission was to address these issues by creating a textbook incorporating contributions from many academics with different points of view that was \\"humbler, more empirical and more topical\\". Professor Carlin wrote that students \\"are embarrassed when they are no more able to explain the eurozone crisis or persistent unemployment than their fellow students in engineering or archaeology\\", and that CORE would ensure that \\"digital technology and interactive teaching methods will introduce students to an empirical discipline. They will learn to use evidence from history, experiments and other data sources to test competing explanations and policies.\\" Course material CORE's courses are offered through open access online ebooks published on its web site. Its ebooks use a Creative Commons license so that \\"any user can customize, translate, or improve it for their own use or the use of their students.\\" =The Economy= The Economy is the flagship publication of CORE. A textbook in 22 chapters that provides a complete introduction to economics and is used in more than 300 universities worldwide. This economics textbook was designed as the source material for taught courses in the first year of an undergraduate degree, although it has also been used in schools, and for advanced courses in public policy. As of 2020 this textbook is available in English, Italian, French and Spanish. In 2017, a print version of The Economy was published by Oxford University Press. Since 2019 the CORE textbook is also available as an app for Android, Windows and iOS. =Economy, Society and Public Policy (ESPP)= In 2018, CORE posted the first units of ESPP, an ebook designed to introduce the economics to non-specialists, particularly students from outside economics courses who were taking economics as a minor. Like The Economy, it focuses on topics such as inequality, power, and environmental economics. ESPP is funded by the Nuffield Foundation. =Doing Economics= Also in 2018, CORE posted the first beta units of Doing Economics, a collection of empirical projects designed to teach quantitative methods in economics using real-world data, also funded by the Nuffield Foundation. Structure and contributors CORE Economics Education is registered as a charity in England and Wales, with a board of trustees. The day-to-day running of the project is based at University College London. The course and support materials have been created by academic economists who volunteer their time, including Yann Algan (Sciences Po, Paris), Timothy Besley (London School of Economics), Diane Coyle (University of Manchester), Cameron Hepburn (University of Oxford), Suresh Naidu, Rajiv Sethi, Margaret Stevens (University of Oxford), and Kevin O’Rourke (University of Oxford). The steering group is Wendy Carlin (University College London), Samuel Bowles (Santa Fe Institute), Margaret Stevens (head of the Department of Economics, University of Oxford), and , the president of Codelco. In 2017, CORE USA, based at Barnard College, was set up to improve outreach in the US. Other prominent economists have contributed to the published material, including Nobel laureates James Heckman, Alvin Roth and Joseph Stiglitz, who recorded videos for it on inequality in education, matching markets and the financial crisis. Since 2019, the CORE online material embeds the interactive visualizations of Our World in Data throughout the material. This makes all data available for download and allows data selection for specific countries. =Funding= CORE funds its projects through grants. Startup funding was provided by the Institute for New Economic Thinking. Current funders include the Nuffield Foundation, HM Treasury, Friends Provident Foundation, The Bank of England, and the International Economic Association. Differences from existing economics teaching CORE's authors claim that popular textbooks such as Principles of Economics by Greg Mankiw are little different in content to the first modern text book, Economics by Paul Samuelson, which was published in 1948, meaning that these textbooks have ignored many of the innovations in economics since then: > \\"What we teach [students] in our intro classes bears little resemblance to > how we do economics ourselves. The great mid-20th century thinkers – John > Maynard Keynes, Friedrich Hayek, and John Nash – initiated a process that > eventually transformed how we now understand the economy, in three ways. > Only one of these [Keynes] made it into today's principles course.\\" CORE argues that concepts developed in the second half of the 20th century, such as asymmetric information, strategic social interactions and incomplete contracts should be given greater prominence in undergraduate teaching. It claims that in most universities these ideas are \\"mentioned, if at all, at the end of the introductory course, or as special topics.\\" =Critical reception= The Economy has been received favourably. The Economist wrote that \\"[e]arly results are promising\\": > The Economy does not dumb down economics; it uses maths readily, keeping > students engaged through the topicality of the material. Quite early on, > students have lessons in the weirdness in economics—from game theory to > power dynamics within firms—that makes the subject fascinating and useful > but are skimmed over in most introductory courses. In The New Yorker, John Cassidy wrote that \\"The members of the core team deserve credit for responding to the critics of economics without pandering to them.\\" Noah Smith praised CORE for \\"focusing more on hands-on data analysis.\\" Some curriculum reform campaigners have criticised CORE for being too narrow and prescriptive, and not acknowledging competing schools of thought. Daniel Lapedus, the Rethinking Economics welcomed CORE’s \\"incorporation of a variety of thinkers in their curriculum, as well as their efforts to make economics more real and engaging for economics students ... But real critical pluralism that reflects the true diversity of real-world perspectives is still a long way off. There is plenty more rethinking yet to be done.\\" Yuan Yang, one of the founders of Rethinking Economics, told The Financial Times that: > “Core is not a pluralist curriculum ... It presents one paradigm, while > students should be able to choose among different schools of thought.” The Times Higher Education Supplement called the course \\"a bold revamp\\" and wrote that taking CORE in year 1 had improved results in year 2 for students at University College London: > The proportion of students gaining a first in the second-year microeconomics > module rose from 22 per cent in 2014-15 to 32 per cent in 2015-16, while the > proportion awarded third-class honours fell from 28 per cent to 11 per cent. > ... In macroeconomics, the proportion gaining firsts was unchanged, but the > number who attained a 2:1 rose from 21 per cent in 2014-15 to 36 per cent in > 2015-16.\\" Universities adopting CORE In December 2019 there are 300 universities worldwide using CORE.

Biography  = Early life = Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit was born on 19 February 1822, in Seu d'Urgell – close to the Principality of Andorra in the Catalan Pyrenees. The only son of Josep Plandolit Targarona and Maria Rosa Areny, Areny-Plandolit belonged to one of the most prominent Catalan families at the time, with a long industrial and commercial background that traces its origins back to the 17th century. His mother died nine months after his birth, in September. Afterward, Josep and his son moved to Andorra, settling in Ordino where he eventually remarried. Josep died on 17 July 1843, aged 55, after a long illness. In 1841, at the age of 19, Areny-Plandolit married Maria Dolores Parella, Baroness of Senaller. They had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood. = Wife's murder = Tragedy struck on 19 June 1855, when his first wife was murdered in Barcelona, where the family had property they frequently visited. Her attacker, Blas Durana Atauri, stabbed her 13 times in a carefully premeditated attack. The crime became well-known in 19th- century Barcelona and shocked the public at the time because of the status and personality of those involved and also for its bizarre aftermath. Durana was an infantry colonel in the Spanish Army and was stationed in Barcelona at the time. He frequently attended social gatherings where he attempted to climb the social ladder and court women. He soon caught wind of the Baroness and fell deeply in love with her. Parella initially welcomed and tolerated his compliments, but became alarmed when Durana began appearing at an increasing amount of the same gatherings, apparently not letting up. After complaining to her husband, Areny-Plandolit was annoyed enough to ask his friend, Captain General of Catalonia Juan Zapatero y Navas, for help. Zapatero agreed to post Durana to Lugo in Galicia to mend the situation. Durana was able to continue his amorous siege by making up excuses and taking advantage of every opportunity to return to Barcelona, apparently still motivated by love. Fueled by frustration and envy, this feeling eventually turned into hatred. Desperate and embittered, he decided to kill Parella. Areny-Plandolit in 1866 Durana had spent the day of the attack carefully observing the Areny-Plandolit and Parella property, hiding in an alleyway on the opposite street. He attacked the Baroness at dusk when she finally came out of the house in order to visit a theater; she died within twenty minutes. He did not attempt to flee, and was quickly captured by a local militia. He identified himself and triumphantly admitted his crime. Durana's lawyer tried to argue that mental instability was to blame and referred to past incidents to prove this claim. However, he was quickly convicted and sentenced to be executed by garrote. Although Durana remained calm and composed during the sentencing, the method of execution came unexpectedly since he had expected to be put in front of a firing squad, something more befitting a colonel. His request to change the method of execution was denied. Durana committed suicide on the eve of the execution by means of mercuric cyanide, likely smuggled in by an army comrade on an earlier visit to him in prison. Rumors had been going around that the trial had been a farce and that the colonel, as a result of his rank, would somehow be allowed to escape his fate. As a result, a large crowd had gathered on the morning of the execution to witness the event. To avoid a riot, authorities wheeled out his dead body and went through the motions of the execution; essentially executing his corpse. Areny-Plandolit was not present at the burial of his first wife and appears not to have mourned for long, if at all. He remarried a little more than three months later, to Carolina de Plandolit, his cousin. They had 10 children. = New Reform = Andorra in the mid-19th century was a country in an economic crisis. Areny-Plandolit led the reforms to replace the aristocratic and oligarchical that previously ruled the state. The political system was largely governed based on the privileges of a small social group formed of traditional wealthy Andorran families, to whom his family also belonged. This type of oligarchical governance made it possible for them to control all the decisions made by the General Council of the Valleys, and to manage public resources as they pleased. New Reform of Andorra With a total estimated population of only 4,000 residents, whose economic power was growing and eventually even surpassing that of the original wealthy families, more and more voices were demanding social and political changes. The General Council reacted with a steady refusal and inaction. This led to a group of reformists led by Areny-Plandolit to organize meetings in order to discuss the best way to bring about reform. On 22 April 1866, the New Reform was decreed by the Episcopal Co-Prince, Bishop Josep Caixal i Estradé, and established the basis of the Andorran constitution and symbols—such as the tricolor flag—of Andorra. It was ratified three years later by Napoleon III. The reforms had several effects. Most importantly, it gave every citizen of the country the right to vote. It also promised regular elections; in this case twelve of the 24 councilors were to be elected every two years, with a maximum post length of four years. There was also the creation of the position of town commissioner in order to control public spending and put a halt to the waste of resources. After producing the official document listing the reforms in May 1866, Areny- Plandolit was elected First Syndic of the General Council, a position akin to speaker.

Early life Jacquemus was born in Salon-de-Provence, France into a relatively modest family of farmers; his father sang occasionally in metal bands and his mother raised him. He grew up in the small town of Mallemort in southern France. In 2008, at the age of 18, he went to Paris, where he studied for a few months at the École supérieure des arts et techniques de la mode (ESMOD). He then left the program for an assistant stylist position at Citizen K fashion magazine. The sudden death of his mother prompted him to begin his own career as a fashion designer. Career He was 20 years old when he created his brand Jacquemus, his mother's maiden name. He promoted his designs by having friends wear his creations in shops during Vogue's Fashion Night Out in 2010 in Paris. In 2012, he was invited to present his collection during Paris Fashion Week. Most of the fabrics used in his collections come from a workwear supplier. The cut is simple, with few details, but original. The prints sometimes recall the world of films by Jacques Tati or Louis Malle. He has described his creations as a \\"naïve\\" fashion. Having achieved a certain notoriety, his pieces are now on sale in stores such as Opening Ceremony in New York, Broken Arm in Paris, Gago in Aix-en-Provence and Dover Street Market in London. In 2014, he designed a collection for La Redoute. In 2015, he received the Special Jury Prize at the LVMH Prize,, an international competition created by Delphine Arnault for young fashion designers.

It was his first book, published in May 2005.  Background  The book is based on a 2002 article Vaillant wrote for The New Yorker. While researching the book, Vaillant learned that the oral tradition surrounding The Golden Spruce is considered the property of various clans throughout the Pacific Northwest and requires permission to retell. Speaking about the challenge of writing a book where principal characters are absent or dead, Vaillant said, \\"Virtually everyone leaves a trail behind them in the form of tracks, objects, relationships, official documents, and the memories of others.\\" Overview The book tells the story of Kiidk'yaas, or The Golden Spruce, which was a Sitka Spruce tree venerated by the Haida people. The tree itself contained a genetic mutation causing it to appear golden in color. It was felled in Haida Gwaii by environmentalist Grant Hadwin. From Publishers Weekly: :\\"The felling of a celebrated giant golden spruce tree in British Columbia's Queen Charlotte Islands takes on a potent symbolism in this probing study of an unprecedented act of eco-vandalism...It is also, in his telling, a land of virtually infinite natural resources overmatched by an even greater human rapaciousness.\\"  Reception  The Golden Spruce won the 2005 Governor General's Awards for non-fiction. The Sydney Morning Herald described the book as, \\"A deep-reaching account of the clash between wilderness values, the voracious logging industry, white settlers, and first nations people.\\" The New York Times said the book, \\"explore[s] the relationship between man and nature with lush language and page-turning suspense.\\" It has drawn comparisons to Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, The Hot Zone by Richard Preston, H is for Hawk by Helen Macdonald and Flash Boys by Michael Lewis. In 2016, the book was adapted into a feature- length documentary titled Hadwin’s Judgement by filmmaker Sasha Snow. It was the second collaboration between Snow and Vaillant; Snow's 2006 documentary Conflict Tiger was the source of inspiration for Vaillant's 2010 book The Tiger. The film premiered at The Globe Theater in Calgary, Alberta on 22 January 2016.

The film stars Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding, Michelle Dockery, Jeremy Strong, Eddie Marsan, Colin Farrell, and Hugh Grant. It follows an American marijuana kingpin in England who is looking to sell his business, setting off a chain of blackmail and schemes to undermine him. The Gentlemen premiered at the Curzon Mayfair Cinema on December 3, 2019,MarketMeets. Film Premieres 2019. and was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2020, and in the United States on January 24, 2020, by STXfilms. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with many regarding it as a welcome return to form for Ritchie. It was also a commercial success, grossing $115 million worldwide against its $22 million budget, which made it the ninth highest-grossing film of 2020. Plot Big Dave, editor of the Daily Print tabloid, is snubbed by cannabis baron Mickey Pearson at a party and hires private investigator Fletcher, to investigate Pearson's links to Lord Pressfield, a Royal Duke with a heroin-addicted daughter. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled Bush) to Pearson's right- hand man, Raymond, for £20m. Born in poverty in the US, Pearson won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, where he began selling marijuana to fellow students before dropping out and building his criminal empire by violence. He now plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for $400m so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their stately homes. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur MMA fighters and aspiring YouTubers \\"The Toddlers\\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson. Pearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates. He also agrees to bring home Pressfield's wayward daughter Laura. Raymond retrieves Laura from a council estate where she is living with several other addicts. However, in a brawl with her flatmates one of Raymond's men accidentally pushes Aslan, a young Russian man, out of the window to his death. Although Laura was then returned to her parents, she later dies of a heroin overdose. Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his students' actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed Coach's crew about the lab location, although Phuc is accidentally killed during a botched escape attempt. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab, and destroys one of his heroin labs in retaliation. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George nods to a henchman to execute Dry Eye, but the man executes George instead. Unknown to Pearson, Dry Eye is in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills Dry Eye's men before she runs out of bullets in her two- shot derringer. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson fatally shoots Dry Eye as he is about to rape her. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house. Fletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders Coach's students to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him having sex with a pig, threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to $130m, on account of the recent disruptions it has experienced, but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a refrigerator, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers $270m compensation for the blood he now has on his hands and the cost of restoring order. Mickey reveals he is not \\"emotional about the money\\" but because Rosalind was assaulted and seconds from rape, he demands \\"a pound of flesh\\" from Matthew's own body, anywhere Matthew chooses, as compensation for this indiscretion. Fletcher approaches Raymond again for his payment, but Raymond reveals that he was tailing Fletcher all along. The fighters have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker on him during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals that he has also sold info to Aslan's father, a Russian oligarch and former KGB agent. The assassin whom Raymond killed earlier was one of the Russians. Coach kills two Russian hitmen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are ambushed by Coach's students who want to \\"solve Coach's problem\\". They assault the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to Miramax. After his meeting, he gets into a cab only to realise that Raymond is the driver. Upon learning of Fletcher's capture, Pearson and Rosalind return to their cannabis empire and celebrate in each other's company.

During mating male and females may remain coupled together for 3-4 days. Eggs are laid with a copious secretion in the ground near the host plant. Larvae can be found until September. The new generation is complete from late summer onwards. Adults often forms conspicuous aggregations on nettles. The main hosts plants in Europe are the stinging nettles (Urtica dioica), but the bugs have been also reported on other species of Urtica and on roots of the marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) (Poaceae).

Tallinn: Estonian Encyclopaedia Publishing. Page 482  Education and work experience  In 1905, he graduated from the Tallinn Peter’s School of Science (now Tallinn Secondary School of Science). In Estonia, it was not possible to study architecture or engineering, so Anton Soans got his professional education at the Riga Polytechnic Institute (now Riga Technical University) in 1905–1913. At the same time, several other well-known names studied architecture in Riga, such as Erich Jacoby and Karl Treumann-Tarvas, Herbert Johanson, Eugen Habermann, Ernest Kühnert (also graduates of Tallinn Secondary School of Science) and Edgar Johan Kuusik. This Riga group is considered to be the first generation of Estonian architects. Due to the lack of architects, there was no corresponding organization in Estonia in the tsarist era. In 1921, 10 local architects, including Anton Soans, founded the Estonian Architects Association (now the Union of Estonian Architects). Anton Soans had a very varied career. Specialist career began in St. Petersburg as a member of the Association of Apartment Buildings under the guide of Ernst Wierich, it was recommended to work with someone for a few years before becoming independent professional.

Soans' urban planning generally saw a lot of greenery, as the distribution of healthier lifestyles also increased the proportion of greenery in the city. Often this meant the creation of parks between the streets and the streets surrounded by trees.

Explanatory note for the comprehensive plan of Pirita district. Tallinn City Council During 1927–28 Toompea hillside and the mound was restored, a pedestrian walkway was built, a stadium at the center of the park with a service building for schools in the center of the city. A quadrilateral fountain designed by Anton Soans was constructed on the pond's shore, near which was built a rock-garden. In 1928 was awarded the 1st Prize at the Kadrioru Park Reconstruction Competition. In 1935 Pelguranna Park Design Project.Archives of the Estonian Architecture Museum. Soans file. Anton Soans was able to implement the principles of planning town planning in a good manner, taking into account the historical development of urban architecture, and thus actively involved in urban planning in smaller cities, towns, factory settlements and residential areas. In 1923 Soans made the first plan of Haapsalu, which foresaw it as a new management and shopping center (not performed), a more densely populated main street of Karja, a fire fighting house, a sanatorium specially for the resort and Läänemaa Gymnasium.Raam, V. (1996). Estonian architecture : Part 2 Läänemaa, Hiiumaa, Saaremaa, Pärnumaa, Viljandimaa. Tallinn: Valgus P.9 In the same year, he designed, together with architect A. Eichhenhorn, a Tartu Ropka-Bishop Garden private district.Raam, V. (1996). Estonian architecture : Part 4 Tartumaa, Jõgevamaa, Valgamaa, Võrumaa, Põlvamaa. Tallinn: Valgus P.11 In addition, there was work in the recreation areas in Sindi (1929), Rannamõisa (1929), Otepää, Vasalemma and Taevaskoja (1932). In 1925 a new mine was constructed on the edge of Kohtla- Järve, according to Anton Soans' general plan small dwellings and schoolhouses were built, wooden barracks and low-rise apartment buildings as dispersed groups (Hädaküla) and officials' houses (Siidisuka). He also designed a network of landscapes for a large pond in Kohtla-Järve, Pioneer Street and Pavandu houses.Raam, V. (1996). Estonian architecture : Part 3 Harjumaa, Järvamaa, Raplamaa, Lääne-Virumaa, Ida-Virumaa. Tallinn: Valgus pp. 172, 173  Anton Soans as a city planner after World War II  Soans’ urban planning intensified after World War II. A detailed plan for Mõisaküla private area was created with E. Habermann (1947). Then the post-war planning plans for Viljandi (1950), Narva, Põltsamaa (1955) and Valga (1956). Revival of Pärnu as a formerly gorgeous resort town, restoration of Tartu as a center for education and science (1945 with Peeter Tarvase, 1948, 1954 with J. Fomini and H. Arman, 1959 corrected) and Tallinn's new general plan (with O. Keppe and H. Arman, Option I, 1946, Revised 1950, was approved in 1952; Soviet Soviet Prize in 1948). The post-war reconstruction of Tallinn provided for the development of the city for 20 years. The first 5–6 years were spent on restoration work, not many new buildings were built. In 1946, the renovation of the theater and concert hall \\"Estonia\\" was started (finished 1950). In 1947-48 the Lenin (now Rävala blvd) avenue and the Estonian Red Hut (now Theater) square was created. The main focus was on the region most affected - the city center.  Anton Soans as an architect  It is true that by the amount of work Anton Soans can mostly be seen as a city planner, but he has several magnificent architectural objects. He was willingly able to work with other architects, as a matter of fact all of Anton Soans's most famous houses were born as a collaboration. First, he also tried his hand in the 1920s in traditionalism, but the most successful architects of this style were H. Johansson and E. Habermann. In the second half of the 20th century, clues began about Soans' ability to perform functionalist architecture (A.Soans, House of the Estonian Seed Farm, Tallinn, Pärnu mnt 2, an overhaul project, 1923; Long 36. 1921, O. Moeler, A. Soans, 1924–25, G. Hellat). At the end of the decade, an individual project was completed on A. Adamson's 4th street, office and residential building (1928–29). Anton Soans was the planner of the Raua street dead-end segment, houses no. 25-35. Started in 1932 and completed in 1936, it is one of the most unique projects in Estonia. Additional architects for the buildings were to Richard Falkenberg, Johann Ostrat, Villem Seidra and Artur Veedemaa-Vetemaa. Its form of geometric volumes has similarity to the R. Mallet-Stevens' street in Paris, France. A. Soans' corner house had a shop a lower roof terrace like the Le Corbusier roof gardens. In 2015 it turned into a real estate development project called Villa Soans, in which the house was renovated and 9 apartments were sold. Tallinn Art Hall In 1933, along with E. J. Kuusik, he designed the Tallinn Art Hall. This was a competition project, which was completed in 1934 with the financial support of Cultural Capital. A modernist aesthetic, featuring a large glass screen that combines exhibition halls, meeting rooms, and a number of studio windows. On the 1st floor of there was an Artists 'Club restaurant named KuKu and some commercial area, showrooms were on the 2nd floor, 3rd floor was for offices and on the top were artists' studio apartments. Due to the lack of space, in 1963, according to Kuusik's project, the building got an extra floor on top. The facade and showrooms were restored in 1995. Today the house serves the same purpose.Kalm, M (1998). Estonian Functionalism: Travel Guide. Tallinn: DOCOMOMO. In the same year Soans designed an apartment building at Tõnismäe 16a, completed in 1936 As with Kuusik, Soans collaborated with the Pärnu city architect Olev Siinmaa. Soans' creative contribution is doubtful, but he has signed both the Pärnu Beach Hotel (1935–1937) and the functionalist villa on Lõuna street (1933–1936). In 1936 the annex of the 19th-century wooden building of Koidula 32b was completed. The house has a robustly functionalistic elements, asymmetrical corner window frames, a round panorama wall and metal railings on balconies. It was an individual project. The Võru Bank building began to rise on the corner of Tartu and Jüri Stin 1937 and was completed in 1939. It was again a collaboration with Kuusik. The house was classically structured - in a small town on the main square, three-stories, high-rise roof with a central two-floor operating hall, very dominant in the city. In the style of president Päts, it had elements of traditionalism, a modern house with plenty of decorations covering the facade. The facade also included iconic reliefs from marble by the sculptor Alexander Kaasik.Hallas-Murula, K., Kalm, M., Karmo, M. (2004). Eesti Panga ajaloolised hooned. Tallinn: Eesti Pank At the end of 1937, the Bank of Estonia announced the Pärnu bank house competition. In collaboration with Alar Kotl, Soans designed the winning project. The building was started in 1939, hoping to get ready during the same year, but the construction was slowed down by Second World War, it was finally finished in 1943. It was the largest house in Pärnu and one of the largest bank buildings in Estonia at that time. Reconstruction and style will inevitably be similar in appearance to the same agency, perhaps even more decorative. Today it is the headquarter for SEB Pärnu. Kohtla-Järve Orthodox Church, photo 2012 In 1938, Anton Soans designed a Russian Orthodox Church in Kohtla-Järve, Järveküla tee 7. Geometrically clear and modest from the main plan. It was the only Orthodox church built in Estonia during this decade. Despite the traditional details, the structure and form of the church are quite modern, it did not even have the onion tuber motive. Since 1998 it was added on the list of cultural monuments, but before that the church built a dome for the church. A. Soans has also tried hand in designing memorials and one of the brighter examples is from 1939 a memorial pillar in Tahkuranna. Designed in collaboration with the sculptor Ferdi Sannamees, to mark the birthplace of Konstantin Päts. He also designed the Pelgulinna Resort (destroyed in 1936), the Estonian Seedlings Community House (Valli St 1936), the Industrial Palace (1937 A. Kotli), the Fair Building (1937) and the English College (J Kunder and A Jansen, 37–38; all in Tallinn, but not built) and Pühajärve Holiday Home (only the administrative building was built in 1954).

The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail. Some unresolved questions in astronomy pertain to one-off events, unusual occurrences that have not repeated and whose causes therefore remain unclear. Planetary astronomy * Planetary systems: How does accretion form planetary systems? Where did Earth's water come from? * Are there any planets beyond Neptune? What is the explanation for the elongated orbits of a group of Kuiper belt objects?See Planets beyond Neptune#Orbits of distant objects for details. * Rotation rate of Saturn: Why does the magnetosphere of Saturn rotate at a rate close to that at which the planet's clouds rotate? What is the true rotation rate of Saturn's deep interior? * How unusual is our Solar System? Some observed planetary systems contain Super-Earths and Hot Jupiters that orbits very closely to its star (even closer than Mercury). Systems with Jupiter-like planets in Jupiter-like orbits appear to be rare. Is it because of our lack of data, given the difficulty of observing exoplanets? Or can it be explained by Grand tack hypothesis? * What is the origin of chain of high mountains that closely follow the equator of Saturn's moon of Iapetus? Is it the remnant of hot and fast-rotating young Iapetus? Is it the result of material (either from ring of saturn or its own ring) that overtime collected into the surface? Stellar astronomy and astrophysics * Solar cycle: How does the Sun generate its periodically reversing large-scale magnetic field? How do other solar-like stars generate their magnetic fields, and what are the similarities and differences between stellar activity cycles and that of the Sun? What caused the Maunder Minimum and other grand minima, and how does the solar cycle recover from a minimum state? * Coronal heating problem: Why is the Sun's corona (atmosphere layer) so much hotter than the Sun's surface? Why is the magnetic reconnection effect many orders of magnitude faster than predicted by standard models? * What is the origin of the stellar mass spectrum? That is, why do astronomers observe the same distribution of stellar masses – the initial mass function – apparently regardless of the initial conditions? * Supernovae: What is the exact mechanism by which an implosion of a dying star becomes an explosion? * p-nuclei: What astrophysical process is responsible for the nucleogenesis of these rare isotopes? * Fast radio bursts (FRBs): What causes these transient radio pulses from distant galaxies, lasting only a few milliseconds each? Why do some FRBs repeat at unpredictable intervals, but most do not? Dozens of models have been proposed, but none have been widely accepted. * The Oh-My-God particle and other ultra-high-energy cosmic rays: What physical processes create cosmic rays whose energy exceeds the GZK cuttoff? * Nature of KIC 8462852, commonly known as Tabby's Star: What is the origin of unusual luminosity changes of this star? Galactic astronomy and astrophysics Rotation curve of a typical spiral galaxy: predicted (A) and observed (B). Can the discrepancy between the curves be attributed to dark matter? * Galaxy rotation problem: Is dark matter responsible for differences in observed and theoretical speed of stars revolving around the centre of galaxies, or is it something else? * Age–metallicity relation in the Galactic disk: Is there a universal age–metallicity relation (AMR) in the Galactic disk (both \\"thin\\" and \\"thick\\" parts of the disk)? Although in the local (primarily thin) disk of the Milky Way there is no evidence of a strong AMR, a sample of 229 nearby \\"thick\\" disk stars has been used to investigate the existence of an age–metallicity relation in the Galactic thick disk, and indicate that there is an age–metallicity relation present in the thick disk. Stellar ages from asteroseismology confirm the lack of any strong age-metallicity relation in the Galactic disc. *Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs): What powers X-ray sources that are not associated with active galactic nuclei but exceed the Eddington limit of a neutron star or stellar black hole? Are they due to intermediate mass black holes? Some ULXs are periodic, suggesting non- isotropic emission from a neutron star. Does this apply to all ULXs? How could such a system form and remain stable? * What is the origin of the Galactic Center GeV Excess? * The infrared/TeV crisis - lack of attenuation of very energetic gamma-rays from extragalactic sources. Black holes * Gravitational singularities: Does general relativity break down in the interior of a black hole due to quantum effects, torsion, or other phenomena? * No-hair theorem: Do black holes have an internal structure? If so, how might the internal structure be probed? * Supermassive black holes: What is the origin of the M-sigma relation between supermassive black hole mass and galaxy velocity dispersion? How did the most distant quasars grow their supermassive black holes up to 1010 solar masses so early in the history of the universe? * Black hole information paradox and black hole radiation: Do black holes produce thermal radiation, as expected on theoretical grounds? If so, and black holes can evaporate away, what happens to the information stored in them (since quantum mechanics does not provide for the destruction of information)? Or does the radiation stop at some point leaving black hole remnants? * Firewalls: Does a firewall exist around a black hole? Originally published in Quanta, December 21, 2012. * Final parsec problem: Supermassive black holes appear to have merged, and what appears to be a pair in this intermediate range has been observed, in PKS 1302-102. However, theory predicts that when supermassive black holes reach a separation of about one parsec, it would take billions of years to orbit closely enough to merge - more than the age of the universe. Cosmology Estimated distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe * Dark matter: What is the identity of dark matter? Is it a particle? Is it the lightest superpartner (LSP)? Do the phenomena attributed to dark matter point not to some form of matter but actually to an extension of gravity? * Dark energy: What is the cause of the observed accelerated expansion (de Sitter phase) of the universe? Why is the energy density of the dark energy component of the same magnitude as the density of matter at present when the two evolve quite differently over time; could it be simply that we are observing at exactly the right time? Is dark energy a pure cosmological constant or are models of quintessence such as phantom energy applicable? * Baryon asymmetry: Why is there far more matter than antimatter in the observable universe? * Cosmological constant problem: Why does the zero-point energy of the vacuum not cause a large cosmological constant? What cancels it out? * Size and shape of the universe: The diameter of the observable universe is about 93 billion light-years, but what is the size of the whole universe? What is the 3-manifold of comoving space, i.e. of a comoving spatial section of the universe, informally called the \\"shape\\" of the universe? Neither the curvature nor the topology is presently known, though the curvature is known to be \\"close\\" to zero on observable scales. The cosmic inflation hypothesis suggests that the shape of the universe may be unmeasurable, but, since 2003, Jean-Pierre Luminet, et al., and other groups have suggested that the shape of the universe may be the Poincaré dodecahedral space. Is the shape unmeasurable; the Poincaré space; or another 3-manifold? * Cosmic inflation: Is the theory of cosmic inflation in the very early universe correct, and, if so, what are the details of this epoch? What is the hypothetical scalar field that gave rise to this cosmic inflation? If inflation happened at one point, is it self-sustaining through inflation of quantum-mechanical fluctuations, and thus ongoing in some extremely distant place? * Horizon problem: Why is the distant universe so homogeneous when the Big Bang theory seems to predict larger measurable anisotropies of the night sky than those observed? Cosmological inflation is generally accepted as the solution, but are other possible explanations such as a variable speed of light more appropriate? * Hubble tension: If ΛCDM is correct, why are measurements of the Hubble constant failing to converge? * Axis of evil: Some large features of the microwave sky at distances of over 13 billion light years appear to be aligned with both the motion and orientation of the solar system. Is this due to systematic errors in processing, contamination of results by local effects, or an unexplained violation of the Copernican principle? * Origin and future of the universe: How did the conditions for anything to exist arise? Is the universe heading towards a Big Freeze, a Big Rip, a Big Crunch, or a Big Bounce? Or is it part of an infinitely recurring cyclic model? Extraterrestrial life * Is there other life in the Universe? Especially, is there other intelligent life? If so, what is the explanation for the Fermi paradox? * Nature of Wow! signal: Was this singular event a real signal and, if so, what was its origin?

She was a lady-in-waiting to the Holy Roman Empress Maria of Habsburg between 1548 and 1581. She had an influential position in the court of the Empress, and her correspondence with her spouse and daughter Anna von Dietrichstein, gives valuable documentation about the politics of a royal household and its members. Life Margarita de Cardona was the daughter of the Spanish noble Antonio de Cardona and Maria de Requesens (d. 1577). Margarita de Cardona was appointed maid of honour to princess Maria prior to her marriage to Maximilian. She accompanied Maria to Austria in 1551. She married the German diplomat and court official Adam von Dietrichstein in 1554. She had thirteen children. Her mother served as chief-lady-in-waiting to Maria in 1554-77, and Margarita de Cardona herself was appointed lady-in-waiting after her marriage to the chamberlain of Maximilian. Margarita de Cardona and Adam von Dietrichstein, along with Maria de Lara and Wratislav von Pernstein, belonged to the intimate circle of strictly Catholic courtiers preferred by Maria in Austria. In 1563, Margarita left for Spain with her spouse, who had been appointed to serve as the governor of Maria's sons Rudolf and Ernst. In 1570, she was appointed to the task to organize the household of the new queen of Spain, Anna of Austria. Her daughters and her sisters were all ladies-in- waiting to Queen Anna of Spain and the Spanish princesses, and Margarita illustrate the influence a lady-in-waiting could have in affecting the appointments for court offices. In 1573, she returned to Austria and resumed her post as lady-in-waiting to Maria. After having been widowed, she returned to Spain with Maria in 1590, where she died.

It is notable as the seat of a large Eastern Orthodox monastic community in late Byzantine times, from the 11th century to the area's conquest by the Turks in the 14th century. The first monastic community on the mountain was established by the stylite monk Lazaros of Mount Galesios, who died there in 1053. Already during his lifetime, three monasteries were established near his pillar: the Saviour, reserved for 12 eunuchs; the Theotokos, for 12 monks, and the Resurrection (Anastasis) of 40 monks. Each had its own hegoumenos (abbot). A fourth monastery, the Theotokos of Bessai, was established by the imperial family and housed up to 300 monks, but it rapidly declined after the 11th century. There was also a female convent, that of Eupraxia, where the monks' female relatives could stay. The death of Lazaros deprived the community of much of its prestige, but it re-emerged into prominence in the 13th century, with the establishment of the Empire of Nicaea, when the neighbouring city of Nymphaion became the favourite winter residence of the Nicaean emperors. The patriarchs Joseph I of Constantinople (1266–1275 and from 1282–1283), Gregory II of Constantinople (1283–1289) and Athanasius I of Constantinople (1289–1293 and 1303–1309) were all monks of the \\"monastery of Galesios\\"; Gregory II even wrote a new version of the hagiography of St. Lazaros. The monastery featured a considerable library and a scriptorium. The area's history as a monastic centre ended when it was captured by the Turks in the early 14th century.

Its plot follows a young woman who, emotionally stifled in her marriage and domestic life, develops an impulse to consume inedible objects. The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 28, 2019. It was released in France on January 15, 2020 by UFO Distribution, and in the United States on March 6, 2020 by IFC Films. Plot Hunter, a young woman from a lower working-class family in upstate New York has recently married Richie, a man from a wealthy family who is set to take over as CEO of his father's Manhattan corporation. This affords Hunter, once an aspiring illustrator, the ability to stay at home in the couple's lavish upstate home on the Hudson River. Despite this, Hunter finds herself increasingly emotionally stifled and isolated in both her marriage and domestic life, and finds Richie distant and inconsiderate toward her. One day while home alone, Hunter develops the impulse to eat a marble, and musters the courage to do so. She finds it exhilarating, and begins to consume other inedible objects around the house, including thumbtacks, metal figurines, and batteries. Each item she swallows, once digested, she meticulously cleans and arranges on her vanity. After Hunter finds out she is pregnant, she and Richie visit the hospital for a routine ultrasound, during which the technician notices an anomaly in Hunter's abdomen. She is rushed in for emergency surgery to remove a variety of objects trapped in her intestine. After the surgery, Hunter is diagnosed with pica, a psychological disorder that compels individuals to eat inedible objects. Richie's parents, Katherine and Michael, arrange for her to see a psychiatrist in the city. During her therapy sessions, Hunter slowly divulges her attraction to consuming the objects, which she says is mainly because of the feel of their textures in her mouth. At the behest of his parents, Richie hires Luay, a family friend and immigrant from Syria, to monitor Hunter while Richie is at work during the day. Hunter, feeling increasingly smothered, is initially hostile toward Luay, who dismisses her mental illness as resulting from her privileged life. Despite the others' efforts to stop it, Hunter continues to covertly consume objects. Through her continued therapy sessions, she eventually reveals that she was not raised by her biological father and in fact has never met him, though she knows his name and keeps a picture of him in her wallet. She tells her psychiatrist that she was conceived as a result of her mother's rape at the hands of a strange man whom she had met in a bar. The rapist was caught and served time in prison for the crime. When her doctor asks if Hunter's mother ever considered terminating the pregnancy, she explains that her mother is very religious and does not believe in abortion even in cases of incest or rape. While gardening one afternoon, Hunter overhears Richie speaking with her psychiatrist on the phone, and realizes that Richie has financially bribed the doctor to reveal the content of her sessions with Hunter. This sends Hunter into a panic, and when Richie leaves the house, she swallows a miniature screwdriver that she finds in the kitchen. Luay finds her choking violently, and phones 9-1-1. After undergoing surgery to remove the screwdriver, Michael and Katherine arrange to have Hunter committed to a psychiatric hospital for the next seven months until she delivers her baby, threatening that Richie will divorce her otherwise. Hunter agrees, but before they are to leave for the hospital, Hunter returns inside with Luay, saying that she has forgotten her cell-phone charger. Luay, who has warmed to Hunter, allows her to flee into the woods, and stages it to appear as though she had covertly escaped through the bathroom window. Hunter hitchhikes to a motel and calls Richie, who begs her to return. She explains to him that she had rushed into their marriage and her pregnancy to make him happy. When she refuses to come back, he chastises her for being an \\"ungrateful cunt.\\" Hunter smashes her cell phone and spends the rest of the night watching television and eating soil that she obtained from outside. The next day, Hunter hitchhikes to the home of her biological father, a man named William Erwin. She enters his home, where William and his wife Lucy are having a birthday party for their daughter. They assume Hunter is the parent of one of their daughter's friends, but Hunter privately reveals her true identity to William. During an emotional conversation, William professes his shame for the rape of Hunter's mother. Hunter asks him if he is ashamed of her and whether she is like him, which he denies. Having obtained closure from her visit with William, Hunter visits a clinic and is prescribed medication to induce an abortion. She takes the pills while eating lunch in a shopping mall food court and experiences the abortion in a public restroom. Cast * Haley Bennett as Hunter Conrad * Austin Stowell as Richie Conrad * Elizabeth Marvel as Katherine Conrad * David Rasche as Michael Conrad * Denis O'Hare as William Erwin * Lauren Vélez as Lucy * Zabryna Guevara as Alice * Laith Nakli as Luay * Babak Tafti as Aaron * Nicole Kang as Bev Production In September 2016, it was announced that Carlo Mirabella-Davis would direct the film based on a screenplay that he wrote. Mynette Louie, Mollye Asher were slated to produce the film along with Syncopated Films and Standalone Productions. In May 2018, Haley Bennett, Austin Stowell, Elizabeth Marvel, David Rasche and Denis O'Hare joined the cast of the film. Carole Baraton, Frédéric Fiore were also announced as producers under their Charades and Logical Pictures banners, respectively. Joe Wright, Bennett, Constantin Briest, Johann Comte, Pierre Mazars, Eric Tavitian and Sam Bisbee were named executive producers. =Filming= Principal photography began in May 2018. The movie was filmed in a glass home in Poughkeepsie, New York, along the Hudson River, and at a nearby farm. Mirabella-Davis attributes the selection of the home to its Hitchcock-like appearance. He also has compared the home's nearby river to a \\"mood ring\\", representing freedom, power and danger, a stark contrast to the powerless life that protagonist Hunter finds herself living. In a 2020 interview, production designer Erin Magill noted that inspiration for the film's overall aesthetic and strong visual look was taken from films such as Safe and Rosemary's Baby. She was also inspired by famous photographers such as Tina Barney, Philip Lorca-diCorcia and Greg Crewdson. Release Swallow had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 28, 2019. Shortly thereafter, IFC Films acquired American distribution rights. It was released in France on January 15, 2020 by UFO Distribution and in the United States on March 6, 2020. It tied for the highest-grossing film in the U.S. for the week of April 17, 2020, though earning just $2,490 from a handful of drive-in theaters during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a total of $31,646 in its seven- week run up to that point. =Critical reception= Swallow received acclaim from film critics. It holds a 90% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 97 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.66/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Swallows unconventional approach to exploring domestic ennui is elevated by a well-told story and Haley Bennett's powerful leading performance.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 67 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Dissenting opinions included that of critic Barry Hertz of Canada's Globe and Mail, who wrote that \\"...Mirabella-Davis treats Hunter’s behaviour with kid gloves – it is a disorder that the film treats as fit for gawking and disgust, not anything close to understanding or empathy.\\" References External links  * Category:2019 films Category:2019 directorial debut films Category:2019 horror films Category:2019 independent films Category:2019 thriller films Category:2010s feminist films Category:2019 horror thriller films Category:2010s psychological horror films Category:2019 psychological thriller films Category:American body horror films Category:American feminist films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American independent films Category:American psychological horror films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:French films Category:French horror thriller films Category:French independent films Category:French psychological thriller films Category:Mental illness in films ","title":"Swallow (film)"},{"id":"57326811","text":"Xylobiops sextuberculatus is a species of horned powder-post beetle in the family Bostrichidae.

Houard's interest in galls developed while he was studying in Paris. After assisting in a botanical laboratory, he was appointed as Inspector of Phytopathology and adjunct professor in Caen between 1911 and 1917, whereafter from 1919 to 1934 he was Director of the Institute of Botany and the Botanical Garden in Strasbourg. Despite retiring from this last position in 1934 he stayed on until Germany's WWII occupation of Strasbourg in 1940 made it prudent to leave. He travelled widely in Europe and North America, studying and gathering galls in herbaria and in nature, building up an extensive collection which is housed at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris. He published a series of 6 seminal books between 1908 and 1940 on gall structure, another on the galls of North America not seeing publication because of the manuscript's being lost during the occupation of Strasbourg.

The park covers an area of 52,300 rai or 83.68 km² of forested mountains. North of the national park is the larger Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary.  Geography  The Chamao-Wong Mountains forms a western outcrop of the much larger Cardamom Mountains, stretching east, well into Cambodia. Most of the mountain ridge is of moderate slope, reaching about 1,000 metres, but some hillside areas are quite steep. The most prominent peaks are Khao Chamao and Khao Wong, with Khao Chamao as the highest at about 1,024 meters above sea level.  Climate  The weather of the National Park Khao chamao-Khao Wong is good. In the morning the weather is quite cold and is expected to be colder. During the day, the wind blows cold all day. Flora and fauna  Due to the close proximity to the much larger wildlife protection of Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary, the relatively small national park presents some larger and rare species that can only thrive in huge wilderness areas. This includes Asian elephant and Banteng. The park is also home to smaller mammals such as Barking deer, Sambar deer, Pileated gibbon and Crab-eating macaque. A variety of birds are here too, including threatened and rare species. Of special note are Asian fairy-bluebird, Long- tailed broadbill, Great hornbill, Wreathed hornbill, Thick-billed pigeon, Mountain imperial pigeon, Blue pitta, Blue whistling thrush and Sulphur- breasted warbler. Among reptiles, snakes such as King cobra, Reticulated python, Malayan pit viper and Malayan krait all lives here. Some of the gecko's living here, such as the Intermediate bent-toed gecko (Cyrtodactylus intermedius) or the Chanthaburi rock gecko (Cnemaspis chanthaburiensis), are endemic to this part of Southeast Asia. Along streams and pools, Green Water Dragons can sometimes be spotted. They are docile tree-living lizards, but are active during the day. File:Wreathed Hornbill adult pair.jpgWreathed hornbills.

RoseNew York City Campaign Finance Board Profile, Max N. Rose (born November 28, 1986) is an American veteran and politician serving as the U.S. Representative for New York's 11th congressional district, which includes all of Staten Island and parts of southern Brooklyn. A Democrat, he defeated incumbent Republican Dan Donovan in 2018. Rose served in the U.S. Army as a platoon leader in the War in Afghanistan, where he was wounded, from 2012 to 2013. For his service, he was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. Early life and education Rose was born in Brooklyn to a Jewish family. His father is a medical laboratory executive, and his mother is a welfare policy and social work expert and a professor at the Borough of Manhattan Community College of the City University of New York. His paternal great-grandfather, a Russian Jew, left Odessa (then part of the Russian Empire, now part of Ukraine) for the United States when he was 14 years old. His great-grandmother was one of the first female school principals in Brooklyn and his grandmother was a teacher in Harlem. Rose grew up primarily in Park Slope. He celebrated his bar mitzvah at Union Temple of Brooklyn in Prospect Heights. Rose attended high school at Poly Prep Country Day School in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, where he captained the wrestling team, and graduated in 2004. He subsequently received a bachelor's degree in history from Wesleyan University, graduating in 2008. Rose became involved in politics while a student at Wesleyan University; he worked as an intern for U.S. Senator Cory Booker while Booker was mayor of Newark, New Jersey. He later earned a master's degree in philosophy and public policy from the London School of Economics and attended the University of Oxford.  Military career  Rose enlisted in the United States Army in 2010. He served nearly five years of active duty with the U.S. Army 1st Armored Division. In 2012–13, he was a 26-year-old first lieutenant platoon leader fighting in the War in Afghanistan, when he was wounded after his vehicle hit an improvised explosive device in northern Kandahar Province. After completing Ranger School, he earned the Ranger tab, the Combat Infantryman Badge, a Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart. He serves as a company commander in the New York Army National Guard with the 69th Infantry Battalion, the second-oldest unit in the United States. In March 2020, while serving as a member of Congress, Rose announced that he would deploy with the National Guard to assist New York City's coronavirus pandemic response effort.  Post-military career  After leaving full-time military service, Rose served as Director of Public Engagement for Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson. Later, he served as Chief of Staff at Brightpoint Health, a nonprofit operator of medical clinics in Staten Island and elsewhere in New York City.  U.S. House of Representatives  = Elections = Rose ran in the 2018 Democratic Party primary for New York's 11th congressional district against five other candidates, winning with 65% of the vote. In the general election, he faced Republican incumbent Dan Donovan and received endorsements from former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden. Rose defeated Donovan, 52.8% to 46.8%, a win widely seen as an upset as most ratings of the race considered Donovan a slight favorite. The 11th has historically been the most conservative district in New York City. For most of the time since the 1990s, it has been the only Republican-held district in the city, and for much of that time it has been the only area in the city where Republicans usually do well. It has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+3; the other 11 districts in the city have PVIs of at least D+20. Rose is only the second Democrat to hold the seat since 1981, and the first since then to unseat an incumbent Republican. His victory made New York City's House delegation entirely Democratic for only the second time since 1933. = Committee assignments = * Committee on Homeland Security  Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery  Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism (Chair) * Committee on Veterans' Affairs  Subcommittee on Health  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations = Caucus memberships = *Blue Dog Coalition *Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus *Future Forum *New Democrat Coalition *Problem Solvers Caucus Political positions Rose supports improving transportation infrastructure in South Brooklyn and Staten Island. He favors lowering the age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 55, universal health care with a public healthcare option, and expanding access to clinics for treating opioid addiction. He also supports criminal background checks for gun purchases and an assault rifle ban. He believes that the United States should rejoin the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Paris Agreement as a way to lower carbon dioxide emissions. Rose urged the State Department to designate Ukraine's Azov Battalion (converted into a Ukrainian National Guard regiment) a Foreign Terrorist Organization. =War in Afghanistan= In March 2019, in response to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's view that \\"[Congress] could have leaned more on the larger role of other agencies (intelligence, state dept, diplomatic teams, etc) before Congress decided to invade a nation without a concrete end plan,\\" Rose wrote to the New York Daily News: > \\"I believe it's long past time we end the war in Afghanistan, but I strongly > disagree with the idea that the invasion [of Afghanistan] was wrong on moral > or national security grounds ... After our city and country were attacked we > were very clear with the Taliban—either they give up Osama Bin Laden and al > Qaeda, or we would come and get them ourselves ... They chose to protect > Osama Bin Laden, and they rightfully paid the price.\\" =Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump= On October 2, 2019, Rose announced his support for an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump for his attempt to pressure Ukraine into interfering in the 2020 presidential election. =Opinion of Bill de Blasio= In September 2020, during his reelection campaign, Rose gained attention for a six-second campaign ad in which he said \\"Bill de Blasio is the worst mayor in the history of New York City. That's the whole ad.\\" Electoral history Personal life Rose and his wife Leigh Byrne, a fashion stylist, were married in March 2018. They reside in St. George, Staten Island.

The book is banned in Equatorial Guinea. The book tells the story of Okomo, an orphan who was born a bastard whose mother died during childbirth, and lives in a traditional village in Equatorial Guinea that is about a day's walk from Gabon. She is forced to confront her cultures attitudes about gender roles, requirements for women to have sex for the purpose of reproduction at the direction of men, and sexuality. After being outed, she eventually retreats to the sanctuary of the freedom of the forest. Trifonia Melibea Obono is considered one of the most avant-garde and brave Black African voices in former colonial Spanish Africa. The book is her second major novel published in Spanish.  Background  La Bastarda was written by Trifonia Melibea Obono, a Spanish-speaking black woman from Equatorial Guinea. It is her second major novel in Spanish, and third overall. Obono has been described by ABC and Casa Africa as one of the most avant-garde and brave Black African voices in former colonial Spanish Africa. Obono is considered Spanish when at home in Equatorial Guinea, while being considered a negra while living in Spain. People in her society sometimes consider her crazy for how she dissects and dismantles societal norms. Her previous published works in Spanish included Herencia de bindendee. The author graduated from Universidad de Murcia with a bachelor's degree in political science. She later earned a Masters in International Cooperation and Development from the same university. She then became a professor at the Universidad Nacional de Guinea Ecuatoria in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. She also is a faculty member at Spain's Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED), as part of its Center for Afro-Hispanic Studies. In 2017, she completed her doctorate at the Universidad de Salamanca, writing her thesis about traditional marriage and dowry practices among the Fang people of her home country. In an interview with ABC, she has said the book is not autobiographical. The surroundings in which the main character, Okomo, is placed are similar to those which the author grew up in.  Plot summary  Okomo, an orphan who was born a bastard and whose mother died during childbirth, lives in a traditional village in Equatorial Guinea that is about a day's walk from Gabon. As a sixteen-year-old who had her period, she is watched over by her grandfather's first wife, her grandfather and a community who has already rejected her because of her birth. Given her place in this polygamous family and not knowing who she is, Okomo seeks to know more about her father. Her family tries to prevent her from doing so and has forbidden her from trying to find and contact him. Okomo has a special relationship with an uncle, her mother's brother and another child of her grandfather's first wife, named Marcelo. Because her uncle is a woman man, the family is estranged from him and Okomo becomes a key contact person in their attempts to get Marcelo to have sex with his sister-in-law. This is important as the grandfather's first born son is barren, and Marcelo is a familial relation who can ensure the family line continues. He declines, and Marcelo's house is burned, but not before he managed to escape to the forest. Attempts to control Okomo by prohibiting her from contacting Marcelo and other social undesirables lead to Okomo to walk with a group of three girls who have also largely rejected the expectations of them from Fang society. In the middle of one walk, Okomo engages in sex in the forest with the three girls. She soon forms a bond with one girl, Dina, to the exclusion of the other two and against the rules of the group that sex should only be communal among them. This later leads to the other girls to feeling jealous and excluded, outing Okomo and Dina during the saint's day feast of Okomo's grandfather. After everyone pretended to ignore this, the two girls beat Okomo when she went to get water. The full story came out, and two girls were married off. One girl was isolated to live with her father who got her pregnant and abused her. Okomo's grandmother basically sends her away to Okomo's mother's sister to get money to fund a cure for her barrenness as a result of syphilis. All four girls eventually flee to the forest, joining Marcelo and his partner, while creating a family amongst themselves.  Characters  * Okomo: The book's narrator. An orphan who was born a bastard whose mother died during childbirth. She was raised by her grandfather's first wife. * Marcelo: Okomo's uncle. The son of the grandfather's first wife, and brother of Okomo's sister and another sterile brother. * Grandmother: Okomo's biological grandmother. She is barren as a result of getting syphilis from her husband who got it from a prostitute. * Dina: Okomo's lover.  Main themes  One of the main themes is about the comparisons between heterosexuality and homosexuality in rural Equatorial Guinea. At the same time, it shows the invisibility of lesbians in Fang society. It is also about the importance of gender roles in this society, and how they intersect with sexuality. The book is also about being liberated from these restrictive ideas around sexuality and gender roles. The importance of gender roles is shown among other ways when the main character cuts the toenails of her grandfather. It demonstrates how in Fang society the older man is always in charge, and how is often does not listen to those below him in the social hierarchy and who is never there when you need him. The leading male figures in people's lives may know nothing because people are too scared to tell him things. Invisibility of lesbians in the book is discussed through the terms used for gay men and lesbian women. Gay men are referred to as \\"fam e mina\\" in Spanish and \\"bequebe fafam\\" in Fang, meaning man woman or man who behaves like his sister. While the Fang language has a word to describe gay men, the language has no word to describe lesbians. The book shows throughout that the value of men is in owning a home and in siring children. Women's value is derived through giving birth and having children. Gay men challenge this system because they are not engaged in reproductive activities. Women's importance in sexual relations is minimal, with no real thought given to their consent or pleasure in the act. In the book, being a woman is about fulfilling expectations of others to procreate at an early age. This is an expectation set by her grandmother that is put on the orphaned Okomo after she gets her first period. The irrelevance of women as things other than tools for procreation is shown through the sale of two girls to pay off debts by their fathers. Liberation from the cultural and societal restrictions around sexuality and gender roles in the book are expressed through Marcelo retreating to the forest where he can be with his partner. The four lesbian girls later follow him in stages to gain their own liberation.  Literary significance and critical reaction  La Bastarda is the first story about lesbians from Equatorial Guinea to be published in Spanish. In 2016, the book was included on a list by El País as one of the ten best books by an African writer. Alejandro de los Santos, writing for afribuku.com, liked the book, but felt the last chapter was a bit rushed. The pacing was not consistent with the rest of the chapters.  Publication history  The book was first published in Spanish in 2016 by Flores Raras. It is 116 pages long. A second edition was published in 2017.Obono, Trifonia Melibea. La bastarda. 2017. An English- language version was published in 2018 by The Feminist Press. It was translated by Lawrence Schimel, with an afterword by Abosede George.Obono, Trifonia Melibea, and Lawrence Schimel.

Miyan was born in 1819 in Faridpur district, British India. He was educated by his father and then at the age of twelve was sent to Mecca for further studies. Although he never achieved the levels of scholarship attained by his father but quickly proved himself a supreme leader of peasant movement against the indigo planters and landlords. Movement After the death of Shariatullah, Miyan led the movement to a more radical, agrarian character and able to create an effective organizational structure. In his view land belonged to those who worked it. He established his own administrative system, and appointed a khalifa (leader) for each village. His policy was to create a state within the British-ruled state. He organised the oppressed peasantry against the oppressive landlords. In 1838, Miyan called upon his followers not to pay revenue to zamindars. Indigo Kuthis, were frequently attacked and ransacked by raiyats. In retaliation, the landlords and indigo planters tried to contain Miyan by instituting cases against him. In 1838, 1844, 1847 he was arrested several times but released because he became so popular irrespective of religion with the peasantry that in those cases, courts seldom found a witness against him.

Rheintaler Ribelmais - AOC package (AOP since 2013) Rheintaler Ribelmais, Rheintaler Ribel or Türggenribel is a ground product that is made from a traditional type of maize grown in the Swiss Rhine Valley and Liechtenstein. Since summer 2000, Rheintaler Ribel AOP (formerly AOC) has been the only Swiss cereal product with a protected geographical indication. Rheintaler Ribel (GUB) Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, Bundesamt für Landwirtschaft, Verfügung vom 7 August 2000 The name Ribelmais comes from the traditional dish, Ribel, from which it is made.  History  Maize plays an important role in the Rhine valley on the Swiss and Vorarlberg side, both in their cultural history as well as their economic history. The cultivation of maize began in the Rhine valley in the 17th century, it being thought at the time that it came from the Balkans, which is why the name Türggen or Türggenkorn (Turkish corn) became used for maize. The Rhine valley, which runs from south to north here, is influenced by föhn winds and thus has a milder climate that the surrounding area, which is why maize thrives here. Rheintaler Ribelmais has a large genetic diversity, since the best cobs were used in small-scale cultivation for new crops and, through centuries of artificial selection, varieties have been chosen that are optimally adapted to local conditions. In general, Ribelmais is characterised by the fact that it grows much better in spring under cool conditions than today's silage maize, which is why it has been used in recent years in Switzerland for producing new varieties.  Growing areas  The area where Ribelmais is grown is limited to the north-south Rhine valley above Lake Constance: * the municipalities of Rheintal, Sarganserland and Werdenberg in the Canton of St. Gallen * the municipalities of Fläsch, Jenins, Landquart, Maienfeld, Malans, Untervaz and Zizers in the Canton of Grisons * the Principality of Liechtenstein  Use  Rheintaler Ribelmais is used for the preparation of food. In the Rhine Valley it is used for traditional maize dish of the same name. Sometimes it is also used to make polenta. Care must be taken to allow the Ribelmais to swell longer than other varieties. Ribelmais tastes nutty.

His dam Dazzling Song was an unraced mare sired by Unbridled's Song out of the Floral Park Handicap winner Win McCool. Racing career =2018: three-year-old season= Magnum Moon was unraced as a juvenile and made his track debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Gulfstream Park on January 13. Ridden by Luis Saez he started well, took a clear advantage at half way and won by four and a half lengths from the favored Under A Spell. On February 15 the colt started 1/10 favorite for an allowance race over one mile at Tampa Bay Downs and won comfortably (\\"in hand\\") by two lengths. Magnum Moon was stepped up in class for his next race, the Grade II Rebel Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Oaklawn Park on March 17. He started the 3.6/1 second choice behind the Bob Baffert-trained Solomini in a field of ten which also included the Hopeful Stakes winner Sporting Chance. After racing just behind the leaders Magnum Moon moved into the lead exiting the final turn and drew away in the straight to win by three and a half lengths from Solomini with Combatant a head back in third. Todd Pletcher commented \\"We felt like we had a very talented colt... this was a step up in class and running against accomplished, seasoned colts. We were confident that he was training very well, coming into it in great shape, and just hoped he could handle the continued rise in class.\\" The Arkansas Derby over nine furlongs at the same track on April 14 saw Magnum Moon moved up to Grade I level for the first time and the colt stated the 4/5 favorite in a nine-runner field. Solomini and Combatant were again in opposition, while the best of the others appeared to be Quip (Tampa Bay Derby) and Tenfold. Magnum Moon took the lead soon after the start and set a steady pace from Quip before breaking clear of his rivals early in the straight. Despite hanging right under pressure he maintained his advantage and came home four lengths clear of Quip with Solomini and Combatant in third and fourth. After the race Pletcher said \\"He showed his versatility. He's won a number of different ways now, and I think he's proven that he's the kind of horse that doesn't need the race to unfold a certain way, that he's able to kind of make his own race\\". Magnum Moon entered the 2018 Kentucky Derby as one of the favorites but broke poorly and was never in contention, finishing 19th. \\"It was just bumper cars for a while\\", said Pletcher. \\"He just got into a position he'd never been in before behind horses, eating a lot of slop. Just never was able to get into a comfortable rhythm at any point.\\" Magnum Moon was being prepared for his next start when he suffered a career-ending injury to his left front leg in a workout on June 23. On October 4, 2019 after a year long battle with laminitis, he was euthanized at Cornell Ruffian Clinic in Elmont, N.Y.

Geomatics Association of Nova Scotia Presidents 2012 to 2018 Through a collaboration among a broad membership representing the academia, all levels of Government and private industry GANS provides both professional and social events, networking opportunities, a mentoring program, geospatial job postings and professional development. The number of members in the regional association fluctuates from year to year but is typical around 250. \\"The Geomatics Association of Nova Scotia (GANS) has a special interest in mapping in Nova Scotia. We are an organization whose sole purpose is to promote the science and application of geomatics (“mapping”) in Nova Scotia.\\" GANS was one of the founding members of Canadian GeoAlliance, an umbrella organization started to help address sector-wide strategic priorities in the geomatics sector.Canadian GeoAlliance Founding Members = GANS Logo = In 2012 GANS went through a creative re-branding process that forced the association's Board of Directors to revisit the objectives of the association and helped identify challenges that were not previously being addressed. It also enabled the Board to model a brand around those challenges in an effort to tackle them head on. An example of this was attracting students and young professionals to the Association; therefore an attempt was made to ensure to design a brand that is youthful, fresh, compelling, and easily understood. GANS Geographic Education Poster Series - Geography Helped Me Get Where I am Now GANS chose to model their brand around the concept of a ‘Lighthouse’. The GANS 'Lighthouse' provides guidance and is a beacon for everyone interested in geomatics in Nova Scotia. It is symbolic of the association's maritime roots and represents both a survey tripod and a compass, measuring the shape of the Earth and surveying everything on top. The top of the lighthouse is meant to resemble a total station. The radiating light symbolizes the arms of a compass rose, portraying the notion of direction.The GANS Brand and The Story Behind its Creation The light itself is representative of knowledge and the Association's long history in promoting the geomatics industry in Nova Scotia. Therefore, the GANS 'Lighthouse' logo is distinct and memorable. = Geography Helped Me Get Where I am Now = Since 2015, GANS has been producing customized geography posters for Nova Scotia high schools to help promote geospatial careers and the study of geography.

After completion of his studies, he became radio journalist at Radio Belgrade in 1980, appointed as its deputy editor in chief of Program 202 and Radio Belgrade 2 since 1983. In 1991, he participated in the long-term strike actions of the media against the Milošević regime and its authoritarian media control and warmongering, then in 1993, he left the radio station as sign of his oppositional attitude and came back again in 2001. He established the publishing company Itaka together with his two sons in 1992. In the meantime, the recognized journalist of the radio station is in well-deserved retirement and was honored with the Golden Microphone Award for his life achievement in 2008. The writer of novels, essays and short stories is laureate of renowned literary prizes such as the Miloš Crnjanski Award (1994) for Commemoration and the Isidora Sekulić Award (2005) for Johnny's solo; his novel Sancho's version has been nominated for the final selection of the NIN Award 1999. The novels Dirty Man, Sancho’s Version and You Will Swim Forever are profound stories about the disintegration of Yugoslavia. All three novels tells about tragic heroes who lost everything they had and even themselves with the breakup of the country in which they were born: What I found about human suffering, which was summarized in twenty books on wars during the dissolution of Yugoslavia, is part of the essence of horrors and contemplation with sunglasses. Ordinary people became merciless torturers. Damjanović wrote these novels according to the model of Remarque and his pacifist work. He was one of the editors of the anthology Serbia in the Works of Foreign Authors : poems, plays, short stories, excerpts from novels, epistles, war reports, essays, travel accounts (1996), which is available in English translation since 2000.

Over the decades, he has become a highly respected and beloved reciter with numerous phonograph records and CD recordings. Damjanović described his art of presentation on the occasion of a performance in Ruma as follows: the reciter must perfectly comprehend the text and then open all his discursive, reflexive creativity, emotional being, to express this text as his own opinion.

The review was published by Oliver Gibbs, Jr. and Chas. E. Young. It was published through an independent newspaper that is dedicated to the appeals of Pierce County. On June 27th, 1856, the review was advertised again in The Prescott Transcript. Young and Gibbs noted that the First Annual Review was a detailed and historical brochure of 48 closely published pages.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 4. There were multiple pieces included in the review by different individuals. Thorough information was provided about Pierce County. The publishers shared positive features and qualities about Pierce County. Throughout the review, Pierce County was referred to as a “she”. Within the review, the publishers included land features, profitable nature, horticulture, settlers of Pierce County, etc. For example, Young and Gibbs discussed the geographical separation of the county. They mentioned the fact that the eastern part of Pierce County was favorably watered and exceedingly timbered. In the southern and western portions of the county there were prairies and oak openings.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 3. Topographical descriptions of the towns within Pierce County was also incorporated in the First Annual Review. One town that was discussed was Prescott, Wisconsin. It is mentioned that Prescott was a thriving community. For example, there were three steam saw mills that were utilized in the town, and they were successful.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 11. Although there were three steam saw mills that were used, there were many mill locations that remained under developed.Chapman 1856, p. 94.  Positive Features of Pierce County  There are many things included in the review that described the positive aspects of Pierce County. In the review, the publishers painted a positive picture of what Pierce County was like. They stated that the landscape of Pierce County shaped a vision of breathtaking beauty.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 3. During the summer, there were bright colors of wild flowers that contrasted with the natural and green tint of the adjoining prairies. Young and Gibbs believed that there was nothing in nature that created a more flawless scene.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 4. Another thing the publishers thought was important to include in the review was the significance of the soil in Pierce County. S.R. Gunn stated that the true fortune of Pierce County is in the richness in the soil. He insisted that the soil of Pierce County was very fertile and beautiful, and that there were no other areas or regions that overshadowed it.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 18. Gunn also concluded that Pierce County was at the top of the list as a wheat growing country. He mentioned that if they were at the top of that list, then they must have been first when it comes to the wealth making profession by agriculture.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 18. According to the review, Pierce County's ability to haul out and repair steamboats was another positive aspect of the county. The publishers believed that Pierce County’s operation was more successful than any other on the western rivers. There were five main arguments that contributed to why Young and Gibbs believed that Pierce County’s operation was the most successful. The first reason was because Prescott occupied a central position, and was eventually going to become the meeting point of the boats of the St. Croix and the Mississippi river. Secondly, the water from their levee from the intersection of the two streams never froze. That allowed the boats to come and go at any time. The third argument was because there were no issues that came about from floating ice. Steamboats were able to winter in Pierce County without being harmed. The fourth justification was because the county had a low bank, which allowed boats to be hauled out at a modest elevation from high-rise water mark. This saved time and money. Lastly, Pierce County had superior timber. The publishers mentioned that the more timber and the greater diversity led to more ship building.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 35-6.  Settlers of Pierce County  The First Annual Review of Pierce County also contains information about individuals who may have settled in Pierce County. J.W.B indicated that the population of Pierce county was made up of sturdy settlers, men who were fearless.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 25. There is a section of the review that focused specifically on Prescott, Wisconsin. Those who had settled in Prescott and other towns within the county had traveled mostly from New England, and the Western and Northern states. The pioneers brought along with them ancient traditions, which in turn gave Pierce County a sense of a New England town.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 35. According to Silas Chapman, Prescott was at the opening of the St. Croix, and was predicted to be the biggest in Pierce County, but also in the entire country between Lake Superior and La Crosse.Chapman 1856, p. 94. In 1837, there was a treaty made with the Dakotas or the Sioux. The purpose of the treaty was to gather all of their territory east of the Mississippi. Obtaining their territory drew in settlers from the states.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 29.  Prescott Business Directory  Young and Gibbs were often considered boosters of Prescott. A business directory for Prescott was also incorporated in the review. There were a variety of advertisements that were included in the review from local business owners and employers. The selection of the ads ranged from things like grocery ads to drug store ads, etc. For example, an ad about a Prescott hotel was added. The advertisement was written by C.P. Barnard. In the ad, it is mentioned that the hotel was located where there was a beautiful view of the river and lake. Barnard also stated that customers’ baggage were taken from and to the boats without them having to pay. A jewelry store advertisement was also found in the First Annual Review. Items like silver and plated ware, clocks, watches, jewelry, etc., were being sold at the jewelry store. Another advertisement that was included in the review was a horses and carriages ad. Horses and carriages were being advertised at equitable rates of hire.Young & Gibbs 1856, p. 46-8.  Notes   References  * Chapman, S. (1856). Hand Book of Wisconsin (2nd ed., pp. 93-94).

It is situated about 7 miles west of Kanchipuram and half a kilometre from Baluchetti Chattiram which lies on the Chennai - Vellore highway. Constructed in Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. It is counted as one among the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu. Vishnu is worshiped as Vijayaraghava Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Maragathavalli Thayar. The temple is believed to be of significant antiquity and is believed to be initiated by the Pandyas, with later contributions at different times from Cholas and Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple has three inscriptions dating from the Chola period. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower) and enshrined within a granite wall. The complex contains all the shrines while the temple tank, is located to the west of the temple. The Brahmotsavam festival celebrated in the Tamil month of Masi (February - March), Theppotsavam (float fetival) in Thai (January - February) are the major festivals celebrated in the temple. Architecture  The temple is believed to have been built by the Pandya kings during the 13th century, as seen from the stone inscriptions in the temple. The temple here is one among the 108 Divya Desams and is dedicated to Lord Vijayaraghavaswamy (Moolavar). There is a separate temple for Thayar in the form of Margathavalli Thayar and a sannidhi for Sri Ramanuja. The central shrine houses the image of the presiding deity, Vijayaraghava sported with four hands. He is seen in a posture holding the bird Jatayu and performing the last rites. Sridevi and Bhudevi are sported alongside with their head facing earth. It is believed that the image is sported to indicate sorrow on the faces. Sridevi who is usually sported on the right side of Perumal is located to his left in this temple probably because of the sorrow created by the death of Jatayu. Ramanuja, the preceptor of Visishtadvaita philosophy had his early education at this temple.  Legend  Temple Tank250pxleftthumb Jatayu, the eagle bird in Ramayana was killed by the demon king Ravana, while trying to save Sita during the abduction. Rama, the avatar of Vishnu and the hero of Ramayana, who was in search of his wife Sita arrived at this place. When Rama and Lakshmana went there in search of Sita, they find Jatayu mortally wounded in the forest. The eagle Jatayu narrated the events to Rama before breathing his last. The presiding deity, Vijayaraghava Perumal is believed to have performed the last rites of Jataya at this place. The water body where Jatayu fell is called Jatayu Theertham. Jatayu belongs to the Pul (a separate family of eagle) family and was buried in a pit (Tamil kuzhi), hence this sthalam is called Thiruputkuzhi. The eagle Jatayu narrated the events to Rama before breathing his last. The presiding deity, Vijayaraghava Perumal is believed to have performed the last rites of Jataya at this place. The water body where Jatayu fell is called Jatayu Theertham. The same legend is also associated with Thirupullabhoothangudi Temple. Religious importance Temple thumb The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Azhwar in one hymn. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Thiruputkuzhi is believed to be the birthplace of Yadava Prakaasa, the teacher of Vaishanava saint Ramanuja and also that of Pinpazhagiya Perumal Jeeyar. Vedanta Desika composed hymns praising the presiding deity. Thirumangai Azhwar has also reverred the temple in his verses. The temple follows Pancharaktha Agama and the worship practises are carried out by hereditary priests belonging to the Porakathi Bhattar sect. Festival and religious practices The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 6:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:30 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Vijayaraghava Perumal and Maragathavalli. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The Brahmotsavam festival celebrated in the Tamil month of Masi (February - March), Theppotsavam (float fetival) in Thai (January - February), Pavitrotsavam in Avani and Vaikunta Ekadasi celebrated during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December–January) are the major festivals celebrated in the temple. Srisukta Homam, a religious practice, is performed in the temple with 108 lotus leaves on full moon days.

Taken about east of Regensburg with visibility of around . The Danube valley forms a natural boundary for the Alpine föhn. The Alpine föhn () is the name given to the föhn wind in the Alpine region. The name \\"föhn\\" was originally used to refer to the south wind which blows during the winter months and brings thaw conditions to the northern side of the Alps. Because föhn later became a generic term that was extended to other mountain ranges around the world that experience similar phenomena, the name \\"Alpine föhn\\" (Alpenföhn) was coined for the föhns of the Alpine region.Der Brockhaus. Wetter und Klima. Seite 101, Brockhaus, Leipzig/Mannheim, 2009, The wind can cause heavy storms with winds of hurricane strength and top speeds of up to . The south wind on the northern side of the Alps is also called the south föhn (Südföhn), its opposite number on the south side of the Alps is also called the north föhn (Nordföhn). Föhn conditions are known for their warm air and unusual cloud and atmospheric appearance.  Föhns in the north Alps  Clouds during a Jauk (south föhn) over the Carinthian Karavanks A considerable proportion of föhn days are not accompanied by any precipitation south of the Alpine chain, so that the thermodynamic föhn theory does not explain the warm air of the Alpine föhn. The föhn phenomenon on the northern side of the Alps can, however, be explained by the fact that the air which is detectable as a föhn in the northern Alpine valleys does not come from the southern foot of the Alps, but from higher up; the windward air beneath it forms a layer of stable air and is prevented from crossing the barrier. Through the deeply incised Alpine passes, some of this relatively cool, trapped windward air reaches the north as a moderate föhn. In Switzerland, on the other hand, the term \\"föhn\\" is used only if a clearly warm downslope wind is meant, which is caused by the additional heat of condensation (thermal energy) during periods of rainfall on the southern side of the Alps (northern side of the Alps when there is a north föhn). The föhn-like high altitude winds are mostly large-scale, central Atlantic or African air masses from the southwest to south, which cause unusually warm conditions north of the Alps even at low wind speeds. Triggers are usually slow-moving or blocked Atlantic depressions in the area of the British Isles and North Sea, which move air radially at their outside edge, i.e. the cold front. In particularly extreme conditions, however, this also results in a valley föhn. They are föhn-like inasmuch as the moisture carried along has often been precipitated in the Pyrenees or French Alps. These southerly winds can bring Saharan dust to the Alps, for example. In real föhn conditions, the clear temperature differences of well over between the föhn area and its immediate neighbourhood, especially in radiation fog, are only explainable by föhn processes. http://www.drs.ch/lib/player/radio.php?audiourl=rtmp%3A%2F Mit Föhn wird es nicht überall warm, drs.ch (radio broadcast, dialect).

On the northern side of the Alps, the föhn is associated with very good visibility due to the low humidity. In winter and springSeasonal variations the dry air and the high temperature encourages rapid snow melt.  Föhns in the south Alps  During inverse pressure conditions, on the southern side of the Alps, a north föhn arises, known in Italian as the tramontana or tedesco (\\"the German\\").Einführung in die Klimatologie. SII Geowissenschaften. Page 98, Ernst Klett Verlage, Stuttgart, 1985, The effects are not exactly symmetrical, as northern air has different characteristics from southern air. North föhn winds result in clouds with rain in the north, and föhn windows with possibly elevated temperatures in the south. In contrast to the föhn north of the Alps, however, the north föhn will often appear as a relatively cold storm, as this wind situation usually occurs after the passage of a cold front from the west. In gentle föhn conditions enormous visibility distances are possible  References   Literature  * F.

He was the son of Peer Meher Ali Shah and remained the sajjada nashin of the Golra Sharif shrine from 1937 to 1974.  Education  Ghulam Mohiyyuddin in his teens He received his early education from Qari Abdul Rahman of Jawnpur and Maulana Muhammad Ghazi under the supervision of his father Peer Meher Ali Shah. After completing his education, Ghulam Mohiyuddin received the caliphate (khilafat) from his father but was not prepared to take anyone as his murid (spiritual disciple) mainly due to his claim that he did not possess the merit that is required for extending bay'ah to others. Only after his father Meher Ali Shah assured that, “I agree to be responsible for anyone who takes bai'at at your hand.”, he started taking people as his murid.  Beliefs  Ghulam Mohiyyuddin at Rawalpindi Railway Station Following the example of his father, Ghulam Mohiyuddin was a firm adherent to the concept of Ibn Arabi's ideology of \\"Wahdat-ul-Wajood\\" (Ultimate Unity of Being). According to him, the Divine Will is at work behind all that is happening in the universe. The Divine Will which is absolute and everlasting manifests itself in the diverse aspects of this universe. Ghulam Mohiyuddin was also a firm admirer of Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī so much so that he is reported to have made his qawwal i.e; the person who performs Qawwali, memorize almost half of the Masnavi which was then performed at the shrine. His biography states that he would sometimes refer to Rumi as “Pir-e-Ma” (mine guide). Ghulam Mohiyuddin presiding over an Urs ceremony at Golra Sharif. Both his sons can also be seen.

History  = History (of the building) of the school until 1929 = Due to the growing number of inhabitants, on 28 June 1874 the town authorities made a decision on the construction of a new school. In December 1875 the City Council announced a competition for an architectural 21:24, 27 March 2020 (UTC)design of a municipal people's school for boys and girls (Städtische Volksschule). The competition was a great success and 56 projects were submitted. In March 1876 the results were announced, the winner was a design from the designing office of Ferdinand Fellner and Hödl from Vienna. Construction of the building was taken up by a municipal constructor, Aloysius Jedeck, who initiated construction works in April 1877 and finished them in September 1879. The school was located on a plot of land at the corner of the Successor Rudolph Square and the Empress Elisabeth street (now the Square of Freedom and Pawła Stalmacha street). The ceremonial opening of the school was held on 13 September 1879 and was zealously celebrated by the Minister of Denominations and Education of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy - Karl von Stremayr. To commemorate the event a memorial marble plaque was unveiled with the following inscription in German: “Construction of this People's School was initiated on 12 April 1877, during the reign of His Majesty the Emperor Francis Joseph I, by the Municipality of Cieszyn, according to the design awarded in a competition and submitted by Viennese designers Fellner and Hödl and completed on 30 November 1879. Classes in this building of the people's school were initiated on 15 September 1879. May the Divine Providence have this school in its care. This construction has been managed by a municipal constructor Aloysius Jedeck under the supervision of municipal engineers Karl Khünl from 1 May 1877 to 15 January 1879 and the designer Carl Stadler von Wolffersgrün from 16 January 1879 to 31 July 1879”. On 18 October 1880, the school hosted the emperor Francis Joseph I, who planted an oak in front of the building to commemorate the event. Subsequent visits of members of the Habsburg dynasty took place on 25 October 1882, when the school was visited by the duke of Cieszyn Albrecht and 27 September 1885, when a visit was paid by the archduke Frederick. Monument of Freedom The school shall forever be remembered in the annals of Cieszyn Silesia thanks to events that took place on the square in front of the building. At night on 31 October 1918 a group of Polish officers commanded by lieutenant Klemens Matusiak arrested the Austrian commander of the Cieszyn garrison, colonel J. Gerndt. At that time the school was the garrison headquarters and it was there where Gerndt renounced his functions and handed the command over to Poles. To commemorate this event, Rudolph Square was called the Square of Freedom and on 31 October 1988 a Monument of Freedom was unveiled in front of the school. = History of the school since 1929 = In the school year 1923–24, the grammar school of Antoni Osuchowski introduced a mathematical-biological profile. In 1929 this profile, pursuant to a regulation of the Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment, was transformed into a separate Mathematical-Biological Grammar School. In 1938 the Mathematical-Biological Grammar School was transformed into a State Grammar School and High School for Boys of Mikołaj Kopernik. The school was removed from the edifice at the corner of Kochanowskiego street and Londzin Square to a new building at the Square of Freedom in the school year 1948/1949. A reform of the educational system carried out in 1948 modified the structure of education. Coeducational character of education was banned. The high school of Antoni Osuchowski became a school for boys, and the High School of Kopernika school for girls. This situation lasted until the school year 1957–58. The next year the school regained its pre-war patron. In the '60s a primary school was opened in the building and the school itself was replaced by a High School for the Working. 1983 saw the creation of Collective High Schools of Mikołaj Kopernik. In the '70s new profiles were created, namely humanistic, biological-chemical and general. In the 90s more and more young people were interested in computer science, so the educational offer was broadened with an emphasis on informatics and mathematics.  Architecture  The building was erected on a rectangular plan measuring with an inner courtyard. Both the exterior and interior of the school, its representative rooms, entrance halls and the auditorium received a neo-Renaissance decor. Even the layout of storeys and regular distribution of windows give the entire building a harmonious look. The windows are separated by pilasters and beams. There is an entrance gate located on the axis of the building. Moreover, the body of the school was emphasised by a symmetric distribution of side projections.  Class profiles  The school offers the following profiles: * Psychological-humanistic profile (extended curricula of Polish, history and biology) * Linguistic- touristic profile (extended curricula of English, geography, German or French) * Social-legal profile (extended curricula of Polish, history, social science) * Polytechnic profile (extended curricula of mathematics, physics and computer science) * Biological-chemical profile (extended curricula of biology, chemistry and mathematics) * Economy-management profile (extended curricula of mathematics, geography and English)  Administration  Director: Regina Rakowska Deputy director: Maria Mendrek Deputy director: Karolina Grabowska  International  = Twinning arrangements = The high-school established exchange partnerships with the 'Institution Saint Michel: Collège and Lycée', a Catholic Secondary School with boarding facilities located in Solesmes, France.

History  Promoting gender equality and empowering women was one of the millennium development goals outlined in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and adopted by leaders from 189 countries at the Millennium Summit in September 2000. The Jordanian government, a signatory, pledged in 2015 the country to continue its work towards closing the gender gap and ending gender-based violence. Despite relatively equal levels of education between men and women in Jordan and a number of active civil society organizations that promote women's rights, there is still inequality in employment and political representation. A 2005 World Bank report criticized ongoing wage inequality for men and women with commensurate levels of education in Jordan, also highlighting the fact that women account for only 6% of parliamentarians in Jordan. While laws such as the Law Regarding Protection from Domestic Violence (Law No. 6/2008) offer women protection from domestic violence in theory, men who commit acts of domestic violence in Jordan often receive reduced sentences if the court deems their actions to constitute 'honor crimes.'  Gender equality indicators  There are many indices of gender equality, most incorporating some combination of educational, economic, political, and health indicators. For example, the Gender Development Index is based on the Human Development Index, incorporating measures of life expectancy, education, and per capita income. The Global Gender Gap Index is another measure of gender inequality calculated by the World Economic Forum, and constructed from four indices measuring \\"economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival and political empowerment.\\" Other indices of gender equality include the Status of Women Index, the Gender Equality Index, and the Social Institution and Gender Index. There is ongoing methodological debate about the construction of gender equality indices, but it has been argued that a common feature among many is a focus on the social status of women, defined as \\"the position women have as a group, compared with the position of men as a group, in different fields of society.\\" As of 2014, under 16% of women in Jordan were employed or looking for formal work.  Programs  = USAID = The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is a major financial supporter of programs aiming to advance the cause of gender equality in Jordan. Among its goals are equal political representation, equality of economic opportunity, prevention of gender-based violence, and expanded access to healthcare. USAID works with the government of Jordan and several civil society organizations to support the work for women's empowerment. The USAID Takamol program focuses on gender equality and women's empowerment. Its website describes the approach of the program in terms of gender mainstreaming, a term popularized by United Nations development actors referring to the examination of different policy implications for both men and women. Among Takamol's program activities are audits of public sector workplaces in Jordan, carried out to \\"improv[e] conditions for women in the public sector.\\" It is funded by USAID and implemented by IREX. The programs created a social dialogue on gender roles and stereotypes that has been reaching a huge number of viewers on social media, support an open dialogue through workshops in the community, provided better employment opportunities and supported the establishment of women politicians. = IREX = The International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX) is a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organization based in Washington that funds projects around the world. Its activities in Jordan include building connections with the local communities, universities, government ministries, the Jordanian National Commission for women and national-level civil society organizations with a view towards closing the gap between community members and policy-makers. Its website highlights programs supporting young Jordanian leaders to become experts on gender issues, teaching students how to work against gender stereotypes, and fostering inclusion. IREX considers its work against gendered stereotypes important due to the fact that children in Jordan are exposed to the stereotypes at a young age through media, culture and formal education. The USAID Takamol program helped the ”Haya Cultural Center” to publish a series of children's books to counter gendered stereotypes that children often encounter. The stated goal of the books is to start conversations between children about their own lives and homes, and to foster a more open discussion and critical thinking. As the project was expanded to a broader audience, members obtained experience in leading discussions aimed at raising more gender-sensitive individuals in Jordan. Enabling youth in Jordan, and women in particular, to get more involved in political and economic policymaking is another way IREX aims to foster youth participation. One contributing factor to low participation in Jordan is lack of representation of young women in the political process. This program provided funding to community based organizations for activities focusing on gender-related political, economic and social development. = Individuell Människohjälp (IM) = IM is an NGO based in Sweden whose work includes programs designed to combat gender inequality in Jordan. IM supports local organizations that advocate for political, economic and social rights for women. They focus on The grassroots level and the mobilization movements and their capacity to build a civil society that works toward a democratic society. Since gender discrimination is rooted in traditional patriarchal norms, practices and even legal discrimination in conservative societies, IM supports civil society organizations working to raise awareness and advocating for policy change. IM also helps with ending discrimination by helping partners work on addressing the stigmas and the norms in those societies. The goal for IM is to work with local partners so that change comes from within the society, that they themselves can work to get their rights and make their own possibilities. Work for a more just society is believed to be reached by activists, rightsholders and local organizations that will strengthen each other. = Global Affairs Canada = Global Affairs Canada is a foreign affairs department of the Government of Canada, and is a major donor to the cause of promoting gender equality and women's rights in Jordan. In 2016 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that $45.3 million will be dedicated to assisting local governments of Jordan and other Middle Eastern countries with projects that promote the empowerment of women as well as overall economic development. One of those initiatives is the Middle East Women's Voice and Leadership Program where over a five-year period $5.5 million will be allocated to support grass roots women's organisations in Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Through a partnership with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) the Government of Canada is supporting the Women's Comprehensive Health Centre in Amman that works as a reproductive health care clinic where women can get access to reproductive health services as well as gain qualified support following sexual and gender based violence. According to Canada's Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP), education has a significant link with gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, therefore the Government of Canada is among top ten donors to education, between 2014 and 2016 administering around $14 million to the education sector and incentives in Jordan. In addition, various Canadian NGO's, including World University Service of Canada (WUSC) and the Canadian Bureau for International Education (CBIE), partner with Global Affairs Canada to deliver projects in Jordan that are designed to help women to access the labour market, thus promoting their economic independence. = DANIDA = The Danish International Development Agency, an arm of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs used for Denmark's development cooperation, has established a project with the Middle East and North African countries called The Danish-Arab Partnership Programme (DAPP), the new phase of which focuses specifically on promoting gender equality and stimulating women's economic and political participation in Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt. Since 2005 DAPP has been partnering and assisting different Jordanian and international organisations such as the Jordan Chamber of Industry, Jordanian National Centre for Human Rights and the Jordan National Red Crescent Society in activities promoting women's rights. Incentives range from enhancing women's access to the labour market and establishing female business owner networks to encouraging female participation in journalism. = Kvinna Till Kvinna = Kvinna Till Kvinna, or Women to Women, is a Swedish organisation that works to promote women's rights in the war zones and conflict-affected areas with a focus on five regions: Central and Western Africa, the Middle East, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. It not only offers material and physical assistance to women's organisations in those areas, but also carries out advocacy work, research development, as well as educational efforts on issues regarding women, peace and security. In 2004 Kvinna Till Kvinna opened their office in Amman offering continuing assistance to Jordanian local organisations, like Jordanian Women's Union or Arab Women Organisation of Jordan, in tackling gender based violence, as well as enhancing women's economic and political participation in Jordan. = Dutch Fund for Regional Partnerships = Established by the Netherlands' Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Dutch Fund for Regional Partnerships (NFRP) has been initiating projects, like the Matra South Programme and the Netherlands-MENA Partnership programme 'Shiraka', that focus on assisting MENA countries with sustainable democratic transition. In Jordan, a particular attention has been paid to enhancing women's role in society and promoting women's rights and security. Projects cover wide variety of incentives, ranging anywhere from improved workplace environment and legal framework for women and increase in legitimacy of women's employment in vocational jobs, to elimination of stereotypes that discriminate against women and enhancement of women's bodily safety and security. NFRP not only works together with local Jordanian organisations, like the Arab Women Organization (AWO), INJAZ, and JoWomenomics Organization, but also collaborates with major international players, like UN Women, Center for Victims of Torture, and Freedom House.  Challenges  Whilst different organisations are actively investing in programs related to promoting gender equality in Jordan, they are facing various challenges. One of the main difficulties is the struggle to ensure that gender remains the key focus for development programmes. Often gender is conceptualised as a cross- category, entangled with other topics, like human rights, environmental or health issues. Such practices 'mainstream out' the gender and can divert attention from the importance of addressing gender issues and specific strategies necessary to advance gender equality. Another tendency of international financial institutions currently is to formulate the significance of gender equality and women's rights along the lines of economic growth and development, or so called smart economics approach as opposed to rights-based approach negating the importance of gender issues and shifting attention away from the rights issue and efforts required. Resistance is yet another obstacle that donors encounter when formulating gender equality as one of the development objectives. This is particularly evident when the right to reproductive healthcare is being discussed as themes of abortion, right to contraception and right to sexual health and sex education among the most controversial subjects. Also, it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of development aid when it comes to gender equality. Challenges include determining a specific period of time over which impacts can be assessed, and establishing which aspects are culturally and contextually gender specific to serve as valid catalysts for the evaluation.

The Münsterstraße neighborhood is known for its mix of multicultural restaurants, variety of shops, and large population of immigrants. The street is close to the city center of Dortmund, and the Dortmund Hauptbahnhof (Dortmund Central Station).Münsterstraße at Google Maps The underground has a stop at the Münsterstraße metro station.  History  Münsterstraße in 1914 The street in the Middle Ages connected various cities in the region. After the construction of the main station in 1847, the medieval arterial road developed to a residential and commercial street. Several bars and restaurants were also located at Münsterstraße. Deutsches Haus and Die blaue Taverne were known as places in Dortmund, where offset agreements were made between traders.Gustav Luntowski, Stadtarchiv Dortmund (ed.): Geschichte der Stadt Dortmund, Vol. 2, Dortmund 1994, p. 471 The Realschule of Dortmund was situated at Münsterstraße and moved in 1907 from the building Münsterstraße 158, which was rented from the local Sparkasse, to Münsterstraße 124.Haushaltsplan der Stadt Dortmund für das Rechnungsjahr 1907, Dortmund 1908, p.430 Today, this school is the Helmholtz-Gymnasium. Nordstadt Dortmund grew as a working-class district in the 19th century. The history of today's Nordstadt and this street and district was shaped especially after the Second World War. Due to the increased influx of immigrant workers from Turkey, their influence became prominent in this neighborhood, due to Nordstadt's low rents and the cooperation among the so-called Gastarbeiter (guest/migrant workers). The migrant workers usually opened their shops in this street, as it was previously considered a shopping street. The next wave of immigration came in the 1990s from the former Yugoslavia, especially from Albania (including Kosovo), Bosnia and Herzegovina and so on. When the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began in the 2000s, there was an influx of immigrants from these regions. Throughout the decade, people from the Middle East, mostly from Lebanon, and North Africa, especially Morocco, came and opened their businesses in Münsterstraße. Recent migration comes mostly from Lebanon and Syria. Today (2015), 70.4% of the inhabitants of the entire district have a \\"migration background\\" (), meaning they or one of their parents immigrated to Germany after 1955; in the Nordmarkt quarter where the street is located, the percentage is 75%. Exhibition In 2015, Münsterstraße was the subject of an exhibition called (Münsterstraße - Dortmund's colorful cobbled street) at the Museum für Kunst und Kulturgeschichte. The exhibition presented 150 years of the street's history through photographs, maps, and everyday objects. Present In the 2010s, internet cafés, cell phone stores, as well as Turkish, Italian, and Arab fast-food restaurants, and stores for food and furniture, as well as hookah bars can be found in the pedestrian zone along the Münsterstraße. The Roxy cinema, at number 95, has been praised by newspaper Westfälische Rundschau for its \\"elegance and comfort.\\" Münsterstraße metro station, with beginning of the street in background The public festival Münsterstraßenfest takes place once a year. In 2015, it celebrated its 17th year. In recent years, the street has increasingly gained a reputation as \\"problematic,\\" because of the rise in crime and the increased presence of drug dealers. On the other hand, people living there claim the situation is exaggerated in the local press and by politicians; these people enjoy the diversity, the young population, and the multicultural aspect of the area, characteristics which, they say, are mentioned by the press too little.

Life  Longuet was born in Ramsgate, UK, a son of Charles Longuet and Jenny Caroline Marx, the daughter of Karl Marx. His nickname, \\"Wolf\\" was given to him as a small child and referred to his craving for food. The family moved to France when Edgar was 18 months old, this becoming his home. He was active in the French labor movement and in 1905 joined the Socialist Party, being a supporter of Jules Guesde. He left the Socialists in 1937, and in 1938 became a member of French Communist Party, in which he was an active figure. Politically, he was a stalwart Stalinist and admired the Soviet Union. In 1948, Longuet donated a daguerreotype to the Institute for Marxism-Leninism at the Central Committee of the CPSU in Moscow that depicted his grandfather Karl Marx with daughters Jenny (Longuet's mother), Eleanor and Laura and family friend Friedrich Engels. In the same year he took part in the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Communist Manifesto in the Soviet Union and in People's Republic of Poland which his grandfather Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels had written. Longuet lived in Alfortville, a suburb of Paris.Angelika Limmroth: Jenny Marx. The Biography, Berlin 2014, p. 265. He worked as a doctor, practicing until shortly before his death in 1950.

The show, which was created by Georden Whitman, is a western-fantasy hybrid focused on a mute wanderer hunted for being capable of using magic to give life to inanimate objects. The series protagonist, Skout, is a lesbian character who cares for her superior Captain Toth who she has a confirmed crush on her which has been officially confirmed. Often trying to inspire confidence in her superior, Skout is often the voice of reason for Toth, who is a rule-oriented and may like Skout too, despite the fact she is occasionally dismissive, causing fissures in their relationship. As series creator Georden Whitman described it, the narrative growth of Skout and Toth was his favorite part of the story and said that the series is well- suited for all ages like his present series, Port By The Sea He also called Skout one of his favorite characters in the series. This series premiered the same year that other shows featured LGBTQ characters prominently. For example, the Brazilian show, Super Drags featured Donizete, Patrick, and Ralph, drag queens who protect the LGBTQ community, Transformers: Cyberverse debuted a genderqueer character named Acid Storm with a writer saying they like to switch between male and female genders, Craig of the Creek featured a lesbian couple (Courtney and Tabitha) which kissed in the episode \\"The Haunted Dollhouse\\", and Bojack Horseman introduced a married lesbian couple: Mary-Beth and Dr Indria. Additionally, the season finale of Adventure Time, Come Along With Me confirmed Marcy and Bonnie as a couple, for which Rebecca Sugar laid the groundwork for when working as a writer and storyboarder for the show. As such, this show was part of a broader movement by animated shows to include more LGBTQ characters. Premise A magical being in the form of a nomad moves across a desolate Western environment, but he on the run due to bounty hunters and others who want to capture him and score big when they catch him once and for all... Promotion, production, and release On January 17, 2018, Collider published an article about the show, describing it as a \\"western adventure that takes cues from Samurai Jack,\\" quoting show director Jordan Cwiecz as describing it as a \\"western/fantasy mash-up about a mysterious nomad traversing a western wasteland that hasn’t seen magic in 100 years,\\" saying that people should think of it \\"as two-parts Samurai Jack and True Grit with just a dash of The Lord of the Rings\\" with humor, fun, and much more. Ten days later, the first promotional video was shown at the end of Volume 5 of RWBY, featuring the logo of the show, the hands of the Nomad, and sentient rocks. Promo for show is from 22:48-23:05 in the video. The following month, on February 2, RoosterTeeth released the second promotional video and released a third one the next month, on March 9. This marketing clip is the same one shown on Twitter on March 9. On March 17, Jordan and Yssa, directors for the show, challenged two others to draw characters from Nomad of Nowhere in an episode of \\"Drawfree\\" hosted on the RoosterTeeth YouTube channel. A few days later, Jordan was interviewed by Collider, calling the series a slapdash of \\"a bunch of spaghetti westerns got mashed up with all your favorite fantasy series to create one epic adventure,\\" saying the idea of the show came from Georden Whitman, a production artist for a show named Camp Camp, and inspired by his college animation titled Sir Knight of Nothing. He also said that his main source of inspiration came from live-action drama like spaghetti westerns and Deadwood which have nostalgia and themes of despair in harsh lands with hard lives. Jordan also described the show as ambitious, challenging, and unique, allowing for an exploration of animation styles, inspired by Disney art books, Studio Ghibli, and more, calling it a show that \\"has the ingredients of things like Samurai Jack and Trigun while still having the legs to stand on its own pretty much sums up what we strive to do.\\" A month later, Jordan wrote a post announcing the mid-season break of the show, and the RoosterTeeth Twitter noted that the show would begin airing episodes again on August 17. Characters =Main characters= *' is the series namesake. He is non-verbal, has magical powers, and is secretive. Although Red Manuel and Captain Toth said he is harmful, he has a kind heart and is friendly. He can animate plants and objects, and even though Captain Toth says these are magic abilities, he hasn't shown any abilities to use magic. His home, until the end of the show's first episode, is a thorn forest on the edge of a desert region. *' (voiced by Danu Uribe) leads a group of bounty hunters named the Dandy Lions and is under the command of the forceful Don Paragon. She may have feelings for Skout, her assistant. *' (voiced by Elizabeth Maxwell) is the assistant of Captain Toth who carries supplies and weapons. She is thoughtful and intelligent but doesn't often understand her strength or have strong self- confidence. Although it is not known why she is loyal to Captain Toth, she clearly has feelings for her. Later in the series, she becomes the only human being who assists The Nomad. *' (voiced by Alejandro Saab) is a member of Toth's unit, and is hostile toward her and Skout. He is below Toth in terms of commanding the unit but tries to compete for her position as the head of the unit. *' (voiced by Max Dennison) is the pompous superior officer of Red Manuel and Captain Toth, while also fashioning himself as the \\"ruler\\" of a land known as \\"the Oasis.\\" *' (voiced by John Swasey) is the ruler of a neighboring region, Nowhere. He was reportedly corrupted through magic, leading all the users of magic to be drained of their power, while the Nomad somehow survived. =Supporting Characters= *' (voiced by Ryan Haywood), ' (voiced by Eddy Rivas), and ' (voiced by Stephen Fu) are members of Toth's unit, the Dandy Lions. =People of Bliss Hill= *' (voiced by César Altagracia) *' (voiced by Barbara Dunkelman) *' (voiced by Adam Ellis) *' (voiced by Fu) *' (voiced by Caitlin Glass) *' (voiced by Chad James) *' (voiced by Richard Norman) *' (voiced by Brooke Olson) *' (voiced by Christine Stuckart) *' (voiced by Kyle Taylor) *' (voiced by Neal Werle) =Twindleweed Brothers Traveling Circus= *' (voiced by Larry Matovina) *' (voiced by Matt Hullum), a strong woman with a beard *' (voiced by Ricco Fajardo), a tamer of lizards *' (voiced by Anna Hullum), a \\"trick shooter\\" =Other characters= *' (voiced by Ian Sinclair) *' (voiced by Shannon McCormick) *' (voiced by Billy B.

In a later review, he called the series a story which brings together the Wild West, cartoonish magic, and classic 20th century cartoons, serving as a magical and adventure tale which features a \\"very silly collection of characters\\" who encounter the nomad, stating that it is \\"just a bit different from the rest\\" of the cartoons out there. Padraig Cotter of Screen Rant described the show as a \\"mixture of fantasy and western\\" with a \\"quirky sense of humor and blend of genres,\\" saying it has earned a loyal fanbase, and even said that some compared it to Trigun and Samurai Jack. Other reviewers called it a \\"charming/comedic adventure\\" which reminded them of \\"Looney Tunes era cartoons with hilariously directed sound effects\\" and has great voice acting, pointed to its Western genre themes, and praised Rooster Teeth for branching \\"into new avenues,\\" citing the show as one example of this. Future Although the Season 1 finale, which ended with a \\"bang,\\" teased that the show would continue into a second season, Georden Whitman publicly criticized RoosterTeeth, who left RT before Season 1 ended, citing \\"creative differences,\\" According to tweets on April 28 and July 12, he left RT sometime in March or April 2018. giving the show's writers \\"the outline of the whole story, including the ending.\\" Responding to claims that RoosterTeeth engages in \\"heavy crunch periods,\\" resists providing benefits, has work weeks which are eight hours, and other issues, This source is included because it gives context on Georden Whitman's comments. he said the company lied to people, letting people go with promises they would become full-time workers, did not improve its work conditions, and claimed they \\"sweep problems under the rug, [like] they want people to forget.\\" RT refers to Rooster Teeth. Due to this criticism and the fact, it is unlikely the show will be continued in a second season, with Whitman saying it likely won't happen because he hadn't heard anything from RoosterTeeth, as of November 2019, about it, instead saying he will be working on comic titled \\"Knight of Nothing\\". He tweeted about the show on December 30, adding that he loves Nomad but hopes people will enjoy his new comic \\"the same / if not even more.\\" On April 26, 2020, he tweeted about it again, saying that he doubts they would create a second season without telling him, saying he would appreciate negotiating with them if they wanted to, but said the next season would have to be \\"done right.\\" On July 11, 2020 on an episode of the podcast Talk CRWBY to Me, Miles Luna revealed writer Kiersi Burkhart originally joined Rooster Teeth to work on Season 2 of Nomad of Nowhere and the process went \\"pretty far along,\\" but production was halted when it was decided continuing the series at the time was not advisable. Here's the clip and an archived link. The timing of Season 2 pausing production, and Burkhart's subsequent move to RWBY Volume 7, suggests the controversy surrounding Gray Haddock and Georden Whitman's outspoken criticism of Rooster Teeth influenced the decision. In a September 2020 Tumblr post, RT Animation director Jordan Cwierz explained Rooster Teeth does not cancel shows it owns, but under the company's restructuring shows like Camp Camp now fall under the RT Studios label, meaning they are no longer produced on their own and are being shopped to partners. Cwierz added that the same applies to shows like Nomad of Nowhere, although his only comment was that they were \\"trying to make\\" more episodes.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species has been classified as Nationally Critical by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  This species was first described in 2010 by Brian Patrick and Robert J.B. Hoare. It was named in honour of Eric Edwards.  Description  N. edwardsi larvae start off life green in colour but quickly change to brown. As they mature their colour changes again to pink purple with white lines running side to side on their body. Adult moths of this species have pallid orange and white transverse markings on their forewings with orange and black-marked hindwings. N. edwardsi is similar in appearance to its close relations N. elegans and N. casanova.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. It only occurs at Big Sandhill, Mission Bay on Stewart Island.  Life cycle and behaviour  This species has only been seen in its natural habitat in December but it has been hypothesised that it may produce two broods in a season. The female moth lays her eggs within the flowers buds of their hostplant. When the larvae emerge from their eggs, they eat into the leaves or buds of their host, hiding from predators. Once they are large enough, they emerge to feed from the fresh growth of the plant. N. edwardsi pupate in a loose cocoon on the ground under their host. The species spends approximately 43 days in their cocoon before emerging as an adult. N. edwardsi are day flying moths. They are low but fast flyers and constantly vibrate their wings to enable them to take off rapidly.  Host species  The host plant for the larvae of N. edwardsi is the endemic plant Pimelea lyallii. Conservation status This moth is classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Critical.

Its aim was to reduce the risk of flooding and to re-route the international border which ran along the old course of the Rhine.  History  Mural with the inscription ' (\\"Rhine Emergency 1762-1890\\") on the façade of the municipal office in Mäder. The oldest record of flooding on the Alpine Rhine dates to 1206. One of the worst instances took place on 28 September 1868, when almost the whole of the Rhine valley from Sevelen to Lake Constance stood under water. The embankment broke at three points. The Alpine Rhine meandered through the Alpine Rhine Valley in a riverbed 200 to 300 metres wide, accompanied on both sides by inland waters and embankments 500 to 1,000 metres apart. From 1861 to 1881, the Canton of St. Gallen, supported by the Swiss Federal Treasury, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Austrian Empire, created a regular riverbed between Landquart and Au. However, the capacity of the river bed was still insufficient, which is why the embankments were raised again by 1890. More than 30 streams still flowed into the Alpine Rhine below Landquart. At high water these were filled up and flooded. As a result, the 20.8 km long Werdenberg Canal was built in less than two years, from 1882 to 1884, collecting all the tributaries between Wartau and Rüthi and feeding their waters into the Rhine. Twenty years later the Rhine Valley Canal was opened, collecting all the streams from Rüthi to Au. In 1910, the Vorarlberg Rhine Valley Canal was completed, which drained the area between the catchments of the Frutz and Dornbirner Ach. The Liechtenstein Canal, just under 25 km long, was not finished until 1943. = 1892 Treaty = Map of the Rhine Regulation as an official annext to the state treaty The 1892 treaty between Austria-Hungary and Switzerland on the regulation of the RhineSR 0.721.191.631 put to an end the many flood disasters on the Alpine Rhine between Sargans and Lake Constance, reducing the course of the river by means of two cuts in order to increase the gradient, raise the flow rate of the river and prevent deposition of sediments. The company, Internationale Rheinregulierung (IRR) is the umbrella under which the two countries, Austria and Switzerland, coordinated the construction and they still maintain the banks today. They have their head office in Rorschach, Switzerland, and a construction department in Austrian Lustenau and Swiss St. Gallen.

Aplysioviolin is a purple-colored molecule secreted by sea hares of the genera Aplysia and Dolabella to deter predators. Aplysioviolin is a chemodeterrent, serving to dispel predators on olfactory and gustatory levels as well as by temporarily blinding predators with the molecule's dark color. Aplysioviolin is an important component of secreted ink and is strongly implicated in the sea hares' predatory escape mechanism. While the ink mixture as a whole may produce dangerous hydrogen peroxide and is relatively acidic, the aplysioviolin component alone has not been shown to produce human toxicity.  Biosynthetic origin  Aplysioviolin is a metabolic product of Aplysia californica species of sea hare, and is a major component to its ink mixture. Sea hares first consume red algae as nutriment, and extract from it the light- harvesting pigment phycoerythrin, cleaving it to separate the red-colored chromophore phycoerythrobilin from its covalently-bound protein structure. The sea hare then methylates one of phycoerythrobilin's two hydroxyl groups to form aplysioviolin, which is concentrated and then stored in the ink gland. Chemical mechanism for aplysioviolin biosynthesis. An enzyme provides a methyl group that the right-sided hydroxyl selectively attacks, forming the methyl- ester moiety that characterizes aplysioviolin.  Mechanism of action  Aplysioviolin, when squirted or otherwise exposed to predators, causes avoidance behavior that allows the sea hare to escape from being eaten. While its effects on predatory behavior have been investigated, the precise enzymatic targets of aplysioviolin are as of yet unknown. The behavioral effects of aplysioviolin have been especially characterized in blue crabs, whose feeding behavior is relatively easy to observe. In addition however, aplysioviolin has been shown to deter the approach of spiny lobsters, sea catfish, and other fish and crustacean species. The sea anemone Anthopleura sola has also been shown to retract its feeding protrusions when exposed to aplysioviolin. Aplysioviolin is known to be the major chemodeterrent compound in Aplysia but it is not the only one; both opaline and phycoerythrobilin have been shown to carry chemodeterrant effects, although they are less potent than aplysioviolin. Concentrations of aplysioviolin and phycoerythrobilin in ink are dependent on species: one study showed a 9:1 ratio (27 mg/mL and 3 mg/mL) of aplysioviolin to phycoerythrobilin in A. californica, and a 3.4:1 ratio (2.4 mg/mL and 0.7 mg/mL) for A. dactylomela. Aplysioviolin is often released with escapin in ink, which catalyzes conversion of ink metabolites into hydrogen peroxide, which is an additional deterrent of predators.  History  Aplysioviolin, along with the other components of sea hare ink, has been utilized as a dye since antiquity. Aplysioviolin in particular has been implicated in classical-age dyeing, and has recently been the subject of investigation as the ancient tekhelet (תְּכֵלֶת) dye of Hebrew and other Mediterranean civilizations, though it remains one of several possible historical contenders. Aplysioviolin was first specifically isolated and characterized as a pH-dependent color-changing zoochrome by Lederer & Huttrer in 1942. A first structure was proposed by Rüdiger in 1967 using a chromic- acid based microdegredation technique. This technique was similarly applied in the years following to characterize the structures of the related compounds phycoerythrobilin and phycocyanobilin. The 1967 proposed structure was later modified to remove an angular hydroxyl group at the 7' position, and the final structure was given by Rüdiger & O'Carra in 1969. 648x648px  Human applications  The principal application of aplysioviolin has been historically in dyeing textiles. Aplysioviolin, in contrast to other more widely-used dyes, is considered a light-sensitive arylmethane dye, and is thus known for fading over time. Other pigments have been similarly extracted from marine animals, including Tyrian purple (6,6-dibromoindigo), from Murex purpuream shellfish, and additionally used as dyes. Aplysioviolin has seen renewed interest in recent years due to its application to medicine and optical microscopy. Especially given its chirality, aplysioviolin and other natural compounds may serve as useful tools for stereoselective drug production and directed optical polarization. Within the past decade, aplysioviolin has additionally been hypothesized to confer medical pharmacodynamic effects. While as of yet uncharacterized in humans, the bioactive effects seen in fish are hypothesized to be recapitulated in some form in mammalian organisms.

The first issue, volume one number one of the Patriot was published on Wednesday, September 20th, 1871. After a couple of months, the Patriot ended around October 1872.Atwood, Culver, & Page 1872, p. 2. The paper was published by Lemen & Burk. The patriot was valuable to the community both to enhance the town and bring more people to it.  Structure  The format of the paper created an easy read for the readers. The paper consisted of 4 pages and on each page, were 7 columns. On the far-right hand corner, the paper included pricing for advertising sections within the newspaper itself. The first page illustrates the newspaper title in the middle bolded in black, as well as the publishers and date on the far-left corner. The paper also features article titles for each new starting article.  Content  The Patriot covered a variety of things ranging from: national-local news, local business cards, advertisements, recipes, and stories. The first page of the paper consisted of both national and local news. The Patriot showed great attention in democracy and by doing so it provided the people with information on government and politics. For example, on the first page in column three, the article “Democratic Platform” gives an insight to the readers on the representatives of democratic party of Wisconsin.Lemen & Burk 1871, p. 1. Based on the political views conveyed throughout page one, Lemen and Burk ensured that the paper held to the principles of the Democratic party. Page one also consisted of local business advertisements such as: William Lesemann: Boots and Shoes, John Pearson Barber Shop, and Muller & WestFall: Banking and Exchange Office, etc. Although the second page is difficult to read, it contains journalistic news topic different countries. Throughout the newspaper, second page is the only page without any display of advertisements. Along with the political coverage, the Patriot also reflected on the values and interests of the community. As depicted in all four columns of page three there’s a variety of topics illustrated that might have been an interest for the residents of Prescott, Wisconsin at the time. On the first column of page three there were several different fruit recipes one could choose from for example, how to make peach marmalade or pickled peaches.Lemen & Burk 1871, p. 3. The paper also gave descriptions of different markets in other states like the; New York Produce Market, Chicago Market, ST. Louis Market. It showed the type of produce and prices offered throughout different markets. The Patriot also included short stories, which served as a source of entertainment to the readers. A story one can find is located on the third page bottom half of column three titled “Josh Billings on Free Love”, which is about a man who craves love and freedom. The forth page is where most of the advertisement are displayed. The local newspaper advertising helped business owners grow as well as networking and getting known in the community.

The tradition entails the use of a hobby horse with a bull's head that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth. It represents a regional variation of a \\"hooded animal\\" tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles. The Broad custom took place at Christmas time, with the folklorist Christina Hole referring to it as \\"the Christmas Bull\\". The Broad itself was reported as being made either from the stuffed skin of a bull's head or out of cardboard. In some cases, it had horns, glass eyes, and occasionally ribbons and rosettes. This was then affixed to a pole, held by an individual, who in some accounts was concealed under a sackcloth or sheet. There are two records, from Hawkesbury and Leighterton in Gloucestershire, in which the Broad consisted of a turnip or swede which had been hollowed out and had a candle placed within it. The Broad was usually featured as part of a wassailing team, but in some cases is recorded as appearing on its own, or as part of a hero-combat play. Those who accompanied it were reported as being dressed in ordinary clothing. Sometimes they carried a wooden wassail bowl which was decorated with ribbons and sprigs of evergreen. The tradition was located in a triangular area bounded by Stroud, Cricklade, and Chipping Sodbury. This was spread across the eastern end of the southern Cotswolds as well as an area just east of the Cotswolds itself. Within this area, it was reported as existing in ten villages in Gloucestershire, and three in Wiltshire. The historian Ronald Hutton suggested that the custom might have developed out of older wassailing traditions. The earliest recorded examples of the Broad came from Kingscote circa 1835, and in West Gloucestershire from between 1830 and 1840. Records of the tradition became rare after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Hutton noted that the tradition had neither survived nor been revived. Much of the folklore involving the Broad was collected by R. P. Chidlaw, who supplied it to the folklorist E. C. Cawte, who then made mention of it in his 1978 monograph on ritual animal disguises in British folklore.

It was established for the purpose of exploitation, terror, and persecution of local Polish Jews, as well as the staging area for separating the \\"able workers\\" from those who would later be deemed unworthy of life.  History  On September 8th, 1939, the Germans came to occupy the city of Tarnów. Upon their arrival, the Germans immediately started capturing Jewish men in the streets, forcing them to do labor, and taking away other Jewish property. On November 9th, 1939, the synagogues and other prayer houses were set ablaze, then completely destroyed. About one month later, on December 18th, 1939, the Jews of Tarnów were required to hand in all valuables, such as jewelry and foreign currency, as well as wear a special patch signifying they were Jews, or they would face death. The Tarnów Ghetto was officially established in March 1941. Soon after, in June 1941, the Jewish people from the area surrounding were relocated to Tarnów. This relocation caused the population of the ghetto to rise to about 40,000 people. Persecution of the Jews The 1st action that was taken against the Jews occurred on June 9th, 1942. On this date, the Jewish people were required to report to Kaplanowka Square to fill out registration papers. They were stamped with either a “SD” if they did war work, and a “K” if they did not do any war work. People stamped with a “K” were set to be deported soon after. Then, on the morning of June 12th, 1942, men from the SS were given rations of alcohol. After consuming the alcohol, the SS men grabbed axes and went door to door to the Jewish residences. Jews found with papers stamped with a “K” or Jews who didn’t have papers were either taken away or killed on the spot. Some were taken to a forest near the ghetto and were gunned down. Others were taken to Czacki school, put in a steam bath, and were choked to death from the steam. The 2nd action was taken on July 24th-25th, 1942. The Jewish people were ordered out of their houses. They were required to walk barefoot to the market square, getting whipped and pushed by the butts of the Nazi’s rifles. Any children in these homes were escorted to a shed nearby and were shot dead. Some of the Jews who were fit for labor were taken for the purpose of forced labor, the others were then deported to Belzec extermination camp. This action was also known as the “Children Action” because of the large number of children killed during this event. In October 1942, the Tarnów Ghetto was split into Section A and Section B. Section A was turned into a forced labor camp split into a male division and a female division. Section B was made up of the Jewish people who didn’t work or who had large families. Once a Jew was assigned to a certain section, he or she was not allowed to move sections. Once the Jews from Section A were shipped away for labor, the Jews in Section B were told to report to the Magdeburger Platz where all their valuables were confiscated. They were then ordered to kneel down in front of the Gestapo officers while their documents were checked. By the middle of the day, 2,500 Jews were lined up at the square and marched to the station where they were loaded into goods wagons. The train stopped one time at the Rzeszow station to pick up more wagons of Jews. The train then left for the final destination of Belzic. A select few Jewish people were able to climb through the vents and jump out of the wagon and head back to the Tarnów Ghetto. In January 1943, the remaining 9,000 Jews left in the Tarnów Ghetto were ordered to safeguard the properties left behind by the Jews that were deported and to supervise the Jewish labor force. A conference in mid-August 1943 was held in which it was announced that the Tarnów Ghetto would be finally liquidated in early September 1943. An end of August conference confirmed the plans for the final liquidation. 300 Jewish people, 200 men and 100 women, were to stay behind to be the cleanup crew. 6,00 Jews were transported to Auschwitz- Birkenau for “special treatment”, and the remained 2,00 Jews were transferred to Plaszow. On September 3rd1943, SS as well as other forces surrounded the Tarnów Ghetto. The Jews for Section A and the Jews from Section B went to the Magdeburger Platz. Some Jews from Section A were selected to move to the Plaszow camp to do forced labor, the rest were put into the Singer factory grounds. Many were not immediately deported. In the afternoon, Jews from the Magdeburger Platz were led to the railway station to be loaded into the goods wagons. They squeezed 160 Jews in each wagon, nailing wooden planks over the air vents. Because of this lack of ventilation, many Jews died during the trip. On January 18th, 1945, the Soviet Army entered the city of Tarnów, ending the Nazi occupation of the city. First-Hand Experiences *'Joseph Wardzala Joseph was captured on the streets of the Tarnów Ghetto in April 1941. He was immediately taken to a good wagon and was shipped from Tarnów to Germany. He was assigned to build underground shelters in the neighborhood of Wattenstadt. As he recounts, “The work was exhausting, 10 hours a day, six days a week, often even Sundays.” People were continually dying of pure exhaustion. People in the camp were only given one meal a day, which consisted of a bowl of soup and a small amount of margarine on a piece of bread. If people did not work fast enough, they were whipped with a leather whip. The camp was finally liberated in April 1945 by the United States Army. The American created camps where children could get an education. People were now allowed to attend church and to have jobs of their choosing. Joseph arrived in the United States in 1950 where he found a home in Derby, Connecticut. Since 1966 he has been organizing exhibits, giving presentations, and showing videos on what happened to him during the war. He has also donated many documents such as the document stating he was a forced laborer. His letter “P”, which he had to have sewn on his clothing because he was Polish, is also displayed at the Holocaust Museum. He now gives many lectures on the Holocaust to thank God for his survival, and to prevent an event like this from occurring again.

He is one of the most high-profile public intellectuals focused on the subject of sleep. As an academic, Walker has focused on the impact of sleep on human health. He has contributed to over 100 scientific research studies. Walker became a public intellectual following the publication of Why We Sleep, his first work of popular science, in 2017. It became an international bestseller. Early life and education Walker was born in Liverpool, England, and was raised in that city and Chester. Walker graduated with a degree in neuroscience from University of Nottingham in 1996. He received a Ph.D. in neurophysiology from Newcastle University in 1999, where his research was funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Neurochemical Pathology Unit. Career and research =Harvard University= In June 2004, Walker became a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. In one experiment he conducted in October 2002, he trained people to type a complex series of keys on a computer keyboard as quickly as possible. One group started in the morning and the other started in the evening, with a 12-hour time interval for each group respectively. He and his colleagues found that those who were tested in the evening first and re- tested after getting a good night's sleep improved their performance significantly without a loss of accuracy compared to their counterparts. =Berkeley= Walker left Harvard in July 2007 and since then has taught as a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Center for Human Sleep Science Walker is the founder and director of the Center for Human Sleep Science, which is located in UC Berkeley's department of psychology, in association with the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute and the Henry H. Wheeler Jr. Brain Imaging Center. The organization uses brain imaging methods (MRI, PET scanning), high-density sleep electroencephalography recordings, genomics, proteomics, autonomic physiology, brain stimulation, and cognitive testing to investigate the role of sleep in human health and disease. It researches Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cancer, depression, anxiety, insomnia, cardiovascular disease, drug abuse, obesity, and diabetes. =Verily / Google= In 2018, Walker collaborated with research scientists at Project Baseline in developing a sleep diary. Project Baseline is led by Verily (a life sciences research organization of Alphabet Inc.), which until 2015 used to be called \\"Google Life Sciences\\". As of July 2020, Walker states on his website that he is \\"currently [...] a Sleep Scientist at Google [helping] the scientific exploration of sleep in health and disease.\\" =Why We Sleep= Walker's first book, Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, was published in October 2017. He spent four years writing the book, in which he asserts that sleep deprivation is linked to numerous fatal diseases, including dementia. The book became a #1 Sunday Times Bestseller in the UK, and a New York Times Bestseller in the US. It has already been published in Spanish (¿Por qué dormimos?), by Paidós. Reception Janan Ganesh, writing in the Financial Times, described Walker as, \\"the world's most famous expert on [sleep]\\". Criticism and controversy =Why We Sleep= Why We Sleep was subject to criticism by Alexey Guzey, an independent researcher with a background in economics, in an essay entitled Matthew Walker's \\"Why We Sleep\\" Is Riddled with Scientific and Factual Errors. Guzey, together with Andrew Gelman, a statistician at Columbia University, accused Walker of falsification of data in an article published in Chance. Guzey and Gelman argued that \\"it is unethical to reproduce a graph and remove the one bar in the original graph that contradicts your story\\". Gelman suggested that the case entered into the territory of \\"research misconduct\\". Walker claimed on numerous occasions, including in Why We Sleep, that the World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared, \\"a global sleep loss epidemic\\". The WHO denied his claim, and Walker subsequently conceded that his assertion had been \\"misremembered\\", and was actually attributable to a claim from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2014. Psychologist Stuart J. Ritchie criticised Walker's approach in his book. \\"Walker could have written a far more cautious book that limited itself to just what the data shows, but perhaps such a book wouldn’t have sold so many copies or been hailed as an intervention that ‘should change science and medicine'\\". Walker responded to criticisms of the book in an online blog post. Dr Greg Potter of the University of Leeds argued in defence of Walker, commenting on its positive impact: \\"I think the book is a very interesting read. I think it probably has done a lot of good. The thing that I perhaps find the most frustrating about Guzey's article is that it completely disregards the potential positive impact that the book has had. It focuses exclusively on the negative effects on things like performance anxiety in people who have sleep difficulties. I think that the reality is that a lot of people who have read the book will have done things to attend to their sleep hygiene and made some changes in their lifestyles which now support their ability to get better sleep. My guess is the book has probably had a net positive impact, so I still would recommend that people read the book.\\" =Article retraction= An article written by Walker that was published in Neuron in August 2019 was retracted, at the request of the author, in July 2020 after it was found to have considerable overlap with an article that the author had previously had published in The Lancet. =Sleep is your superpower= A TED talk given by Walker in 2019 entitled Sleep is your superpower was extensively criticised by Markus Loecher, Professor for Mathematics and Statistics at Berlin School of Economics and Law. The blog post included advice to \\"not believe outrageous sounding scientific claims, even if they are put forth by academic superstars\\" and criticised the fact- checking that occurred within the TED organisation.

As a two-year-old in 2017 he was one of the best colts of his generation in Europe, winning all three of his races including the Beresford Stakes and the Racing Post Trophy. On his three-year-old debut the colt won the 2000 Guineas before finishing fourth when odds-on favourite for the 2018 Epsom Derby. He went on to be placed in the Irish Derby, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes. Background Saxon Warrior is a bay colt with a narrow white blaze bred in Japan by Orpendale, Chelston & Wynatt, a breeding company associated with the Coolmore Stud. Like most Coolmore horses he was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. For racing purposes Saxon Warrior was registered as being owned by Derrick Smith, Mrs John Magnier and Michael Tabor although the precise details of his ownership differed from race to race. He is from the eighth crop of foals sired by Japanese Triple Crown champion Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun(2400m), Tenno Sho(3200m), Arima Kinen(2500m) and Japan Cup(2400m). Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Satono Diamond and Makahiki. Saxon Warrior is the second foal of his dam Maybe who was awarded the title of European Champion Two-Year-Old Filly in 2011 when she was undefeated in five races including the Moyglare Stud Stakes. Maybe's dam Sumora was a half-sister to Dancing Rain and closely related to Dr Devious. Racing career =2017: two-year-old season= Saxon Warrior made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over one mile at the Curragh on 27 August in which he was ridden by his trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien and started at odds of 8/1 in a fourteen-runner field. After racing towards the rear of the field for most of the way he began to make rapid progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead inside the furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a quarter lengths from Meagher's Flag. Four weeks later, the colt was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Beresford Stakes over the same distance at Naas Racecourse. Ridden by Ryan Moore he was made the 5/6 favourite with the best of his four opponents appearing to be his stablemates Delano Roosevelt and Kew Gardens. After settling in third place, Saxon Warrior took the lead approaching the final furlong and went clear of his rivals to win by two lengths from Delano Roosevelt. On 28 October, Saxon Warrior, accompanied by his stablemates Seahenge (Champagne Stakes), The Pentagon (Tyros Stakes) and Coat of Arms was sent to England to contest the Group 1 Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse. The Irish contingent was completed by the National Stakes winner Verbal Dexterity, while the best of the British contenders appeared to be Roaring Lion and Chilean (Ascendant Stakes). Ridden by Moore, and starting the 13/8 favourite, Saxon Warrior tracked the leaders before going to the front two furlongs out. He was overtaken by Roaring Lion and hampered as his rival hung left but rallied \\"gamely\\" in the final strides to regain the advantage and win by a neck. The colt's victory gave Aidan O'Brien a record-breaking 26th Group 1 win of the season and saw Saxon Warrior promoted to favourite for the following year's Epsom Derby. =2018: three- year-old season= Commenting on Saxon Warrior's progress in the early spring of 2018, Aidan O'Brien said \\"He's done very well and is a massive, big, physical horse. He was a big horse last year but he's bigger this year... He'll probably go straight for the Guineas.\\" As O'Brien predicted he made his seasonal debut in the 210th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 5 May and with Moore engaged to ride Mendelssohn in the Kentucky Derby the colt was ridden by Donnacha O'Brien. Saxon Warrior was made the 3/1 second favourite behind Masar while the other twelve runners included Roaring Lion, Gustav Klimt (Superlative Stakes), Elarqam (Somerville Tattersall Stakes), Expert Eye, James Garfield (Greenham Stakes), Rajasinghe (Coventry Stakes) and Cardsharp (July Stakes). Saxon Warrior was not among the early leaders as Murillo set the pace from Cardsharp, but moved into the lead two furlongs out. Staying on strongly down the centre of the course he won by one and a half lengths from the 50/1 outsider Tip Two Win who took second place ahead of Masar, Elarqaman and Roaring Lion. Donnacha O'Brien commented \\"It's very special. Obviously, I’m winning this race and riding in big races because of the position I’m in. I’m just very grateful. He's a very good horse, he's a proper horse\\". Derrick Smith's son Paul said \\"It was really eye- catching, Donnacha couldn’t speak too highly of him. He said when he quickened it was all over in a flash. He probably got there sooner than he wanted to, but he had so much horse under him. It's very exciting when they have that speed and look like they’ll get further. All things point to June now.\\" At Epsom Racecourse on 2 June Saxon Warrior started the 4/5 favourite in a twelve-runner field for the 2018 Epsom Derby. Ridden by Moore he stumbled at the start and had difficulty obtaining a clear run in the straight before staying on in the closing stages to finish fourth behind Masar, Dee Ex Bee and Roaring Lion. Four weeks later at the Curragh the colt started favourite for the Irish Derby, but despite making steady progress in the straight he never looked likely to win and finished third, beaten half a length and a neck by Latrobe and Rostropovich. He was then dropped back in distance and matched against older horses in the ten-furlong Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park a week later. He was beaten a neck by Roaring Lion after a sustained struggle over the final furlong and looked a slightly unlucky loser as he was bumped by his rival in the final strides. At York Racecourse on 22 August he contested the International Stakes but proved no match for Roaring Lion, and was beaten five length into fourth place. The colt produced a much better effort in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in which he took the lead in the straight and looked likely to win but was run down in the final strides and beaten a neck by his old rival Roaring Lion. Saxon Warrior was found to be lame after his run in the Irish Champion Stakes and a veterinary examination revealed a serious injury to the flexor tendon in his left foreleg. Aidan O'Brien announced on 16 September that the colt was to be retired from racing. Assessment and honours In the official European Classification for 2017, Saxon Warrior was rated the second-best two-year-old of the season, three pounds behind his stablemate U S Navy Flag.

Frontier did jobs for Toho International, Toei Animation and Shochiku Company, dubbing their films into English for export. Along with New York’s Titra Studios, Rome's Associated Recording Artists, and Hong Kong’s Axis and Omni Productions, Frontier was one of the early pioneers in English-language dubbing.  History  Frontier Enterprises was founded in 1964 by Cincinnati-born Korean War veteran William Ross, whose initial postwar plans were to join the Japanese State Department but instead became involved with the Japanese film industry. He became involved in the dubbing industry in 1959, upon recommendation by Japanese actor So Yamamura. He showed such a talent for the industry, that the Japanese dubbing director left Ross in charge on the first day. As the other Tokyo-based dubbing companies began to fold, Ross decided to found Frontier Enterprises, which soon began working for all the major studios, having dubbed over 500 live-action and animated films and TV Shows. Ross worked as dialogue writer, dubbing director and voice actor, with his wife doing most translations for the English scripts. Instead of using professional talent, Ross was forced to rely on whatever native English speakers he could find in Tokyo. Businessmen, students, musicians, anyone, regardless of acting experience were eligible to provide their voices to Frontier dubs. Even so, Ross would hold auditions, making sure to hire the best people available, and trained them thoroughly before recording sessions. Frontier is possibly best known for dubbing some of the early Godzilla films such as Ebirah, Horror of the Deep (later known as Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster), Son of Godzilla, and Destroy All Monsters. However, for reasons unclear, American International Pictures would produce their own dubs for these movies (dubbed by Titra Studios in New York) likely due to them not finding the Frontier dubs of good enough quality. As a result, fans will typically refer to the Frontier dubs as the “International dubs” as these would often appear in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking European countries. The Frontier dubs have often appeared on recent DVD and Blu-Ray releases as well. In the 1970s, Toho moved to Hong Kong’s Axis International and Omni Productions for English-dubbed Godzilla films. The reason for this is unclear, though Toho would go on to commission Frontier to dub The Mystery of Mamo for JAL flights. With this, Frontier began to largely move into Japanese animated films in the late 70s and throughout the 1980s. These films would mostly be released on VHS by Celebrity Home Entertainment under their “Just For Kids” label throughout the 80s. By the 1990s, Frontier began to move into voice acting for video games which is where it would mostly focus until Ross retired and the company closed in 2000.

The earthquake's epicenter was near the south flank of Kīlauea, which has been the site of seismic and volcanic activity since late April. According to the United States Geological Survey the quake was related to the new lava outbreaks at the volcano,The \\"lurch\\" of the M6.9 earthquake was prompted by pressure in the east rift zone due to the magma intrusion., and it resulted in the Hilina Slump moving about two feet. It was the largest earthquake to affect Hawaii since the 1975 earthquake, which affected the same region, killing two people and injuring another 28. The earthquake had a maximum strength on the Mercalli intensity scale of VIII (Severe). The earthquake was preceded by a smaller event, measuring 5.4, that was felt across the island and as far away as Oahu. The earthquake produced a minor tsunami that reached a maximum height of 40 cm (15.7 in.) in Kapoho, 20 cm (7.9 in.) in Hilo and 15 cm (5.9 in.) in Honuapo.  Tectonic setting  Hawaii island is affected by a large number of minor earthquakes related to the movement of magma beneath its active volcanoes. Additionally there are less frequent tectonic earthquakes that are caused either by faulting within the volcanoes or by slip along the basal detachment surface at the top of the oceanic crust associated with the gradual collapse of the island's flanks as it continues to be enlarged. Near Kilauea volcano, the largest structure formed by the collapse of the southeastern flank of the island is the Hilina slump. This slump moves seaward at an average rate of . The slump moved during the May 4 earthquake by about and has moved during previous earthquakes, such as those in 1868 and 1975.  Earthquake  The main earthquake was preceded almost exactly an hour earlier by a 5.4 foreshock with a similar epicenter and focal mechanism. Analysis of seismic waveforms suggest that the mainshock was most likely caused by slip on a thrust fault dipping at 20° to the northwest beneath the southeastern flank of the volcano. The mainshock was followed by four aftershocks greater than 4.5 over the next 30 minutes. Smaller aftershock continued to occur for months after the main earthquake. Further analysis of Love waves, whose radiation pattern gives a greater discrimination on low-angle dips, indicate that the rupture occurred on a plane dipping at about 7°, consistent with it happening at the base of the Hawaiian volcanic rocks, where they overly sedimentary rocks on the earlier seafloor. The calculated low rupture speed is also consistent with propagation along a relatively weak zone. This would make it similar to the 1975 Kalapana earthquake.  Damage  The quake damaged many buildings, caused landslides that damaged shorelines, and caused cracks in a road, causing it to be shut down. {Foreshock and aftershock occurrence with time Map of aftershock distribution }  See also  * List of earthquakes in Hawaii * 2018 lower Puna eruption  References   External links  * Category:2018 earthquakes Category:2018 in Hawaii Category:Earthquakes in Hawaii Category:May 2018 events in the United States Category:May 2018 events in Oceania Category:2018 tsunamis ","title":"2018 Hawaii earthquake"},{"id":"57329145","text":"Victoria Azarenka and Ágnes Szávay were the defending champions, but did not compete in the Juniors that year.

It is associated with the Lambda Orionis star-forming region and has an extended circumtrinary protoplanetary disk. Observational history GW Orionis first came to the attention of astronomers when it was published, as MHA 265-2, in a list of stars whose spectra have bright H and K lines of calcium. The multiple nature of GW Orionis was first discovered by Robert D. Mathieu, Fred Adams and David W. Latham during a radial velocity survey of late type H-alpha emission stars in the Lambda Orionis Association. Radial velocities of the primary star were measured from 45 high resolution spectra and were used to determine the orbital elements. A trend in the radial velocity residuals indicated either an additional stellar companion with an orbital period of years or a global asymmetric gravitational instability in a circumstellar disc. GW Orionis B and the third member of the system, GW Orionis C, were directly detected in 2011 using the IOTA interferometer located on Mount Hopkins in Arizona. Protoplanetary disk GW Orionis has a large and massive protoplanetary disk surrounding it. The dust continuum emission suggests a disk radius of approximately 400 astronomical units. The disk has an inclination of 137.6°. Orbital architecture The A and B components of GW Orionis form a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a 241-day period while component C orbits the inner pair with an 11.5 year period. It is likely that at least one of the stellar orbital planes is misaligned with the plane of the protoplanetary disk by as much as 45°. Variability A light curve covering 30 years revealed 30 day eclipse events varying in depth between 0.1 and 0.7 magnitudes as well as a 0.2 magnitude sinusoidal oscillation that is aligned with the AB–C orbital period. This suggests that the A–B pair may be partially obscured due to dust in the disk as the pair approaches apoastron in the hierarchical orbit.

It has a single heart-shaped leaf and a single dark green or light green flower with reddish maroon streaks and blotches and long, thread-like lateral sepals and petals. It grows in highland areas on both main islands.  Description  Corybas confusus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single heart-shaped to almost round leaf long and with a petiole a further long. There is a single erect, dark green or light green flower with reddish maroon streaks and blotches on a peduncle long and reaching to a height of . The largest part of the flower is the dorsal sepal which arches and partly forms a hood over the labellum. The lateral sepals are thread-like, whitish or reddish and long. The petals are similar to the lateral sepals but . The labellum is dark red with a pale green to yellowish centre, about wide and folded lengthwise forming a groove along its centre line. Flowering occurs from October to December.  Taxonomy  Corybas confusus was first formally described in 2016 by Carlos Lehnebach from a specimen collected near Lake Rotoiti in the Nelson Lakes National Park and the description was published in Phytotaxa. The specific epithet (confusus) refers to the similarity of the flowers of this species with those of C. obscurus and to the similarity of the leaf to those of C. macranthus and C. orbiculatus.

A graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, during World War I he served in the American Expeditionary Forces on the Western Front, and returned to the United States to train artillery students. He spent time teaching and attending various army schools from 1918–1942; including the United States Army Command and General Staff College and United States Army War College. In May 1942, he took command of the 79th Infantry Division. He led the division in the Normandy landings, and oversaw many of its battles until May 1945. After World War II ended, Wyche took command of VIII Corps. He would later serve on the Officer Interview Board and command III Corps and 1st Service Command. He served as Inspector General of the Army from January 1947 to September 1948, during which he investigated charges that John C. H. Lee misused enlisted men under his command in occupied Italy. Wyche retired from the army in September 1948, and moved to Pinehurst, North Carolina. Early life Wyche was born on 16 October 1887, on Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, the son of Lawrence Olin Wyche and his wife Lorena Howard. Lawrence was the pastor of the Methodist church on Ocracoke. Wyche attended the Quackenbush School in Laurinburg, North Carolina. He received an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Wyche entered the Military Academy on 15 June 1907. He graduated on 13 June 1911, 68th in his class of 82. Upon graduating, he received a commission as second lieutenant in the 30th Infantry Division. His classmates included John P. Lucas, Frederick Gilbreath, Charles P. Hall, Joseph Cowles Mehaffey, John Homer, Paul W. Baade, and William Henry Harrison Morris Jr. Military career =Early career and World War I= Wyche served from September 1911 to February 1912 at Fort Mason, in California, before he was transferred to the Presidio of Monterey in California. He returned to Fort Mason from May to June. After leaving Fort Mason, he traveled to Fort William H. Seward in Alaska, where Wyche remained until July 1914. He later spent several months at the Plattsburgh Barracks in Plattsburgh, New York, before graduating from the Mounted Service School, and serving in Texas beginning in 1916 (briefly with the Signal Corps), during which he was promoted to first lieutenant. In 1917, he married Mary Louise Dunn. They had a daughter, Elizabeth. He spent time at Fort Sam Houston, Leon Springs and Camp MacArthur in Texas, and Camp Upton in New York, until May 1917, during which he was appointed to captain. Upon joining the American Expeditionary Forces on 18 May 1917, Wyche was promoted to the temporary rank of major then lieutenant colonel. He embarked for France on 22 June 1917, and spent most of his time in the St. Dié sector on the Western Front, before returning to the United States to help train gunners in early August. He took command of an artillery regiment at Camp Jackson, in South Carolina, from July 1918 to December 1918. After leaving Camp Jackson, Wyche traveled to Washington, D.C., to work with the Purchase, Storage, and Traffic Division of the War Department. He remained there until December 1919, when Wyche instructed students in artillery at Camp Taylor, in Kentucky. In 1920, he reverted to his substantive rank of captain, and taught at Camp Knox, in Kentucky, from June 1920 to June 1922. Being promoted to major while at Camp Knox, Wyche spent the next ten years instructing artillery students at Fort Sill, in Oklahoma, and Forts Leavenworth and Riley in Kansas. He also attended the United States Army Field Artillery School and United States Army Command and General Staff College, and at one point commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Field Artillery Regiment. The shoulder insignia of the 79th Infantry Division, which Ira T. Wyche commanded for much of World War II. Wyche left Fort Riley in August 1933 to attend the United States Army War College. After graduating, he assumed command of the 1st Battalion of the 14th Field Artillery Regiment in 1934. While in command, he received a promotion to lieutenant colonel. He later commanded the 2nd Battalion of the 4th Field Artillery Regiment from September 1938 to June 1940, when he was promoted to colonel. He then was the chief of the training sector at the Office of the Chief of Field Artillery until April 1941 (during which he became a brigadier general). At Camp Blanding in Florida, he was the commanding general of the 74th Field Artillery Brigade until March 1942. He took a course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College, where, after graduating, he was temporarily promoted to major general on 17 April 1942. =World War II and postwar period= Wyche spent time at various military camps, including Camp Pickett in Virginia, Camp Blanding, the Tennessee Maneuver Area, the Desert Training Center, Camp Phillips in Kansas, and the South Boston Army Base. He was appointed the commander of the 79th Infantry Division of the XV Corps, on 15 June 1942. He oversaw the division's attacks at the Battle of Cherbourg, where it spearheaded the attack on Fort Déroulède, and fought in several other battles, including the fight for the Forest of Parroy. The division participated in Operation Flashpoint in 1945. While commanding the 79th Infantry Division, Wyche created a new program for funneling replacement troops into front line units. He felt that new recruits were not receiving enough training, and he created a divisional replacement pool. Each infantry regiment sent one officer and one noncommissioned officer to serve on the staff of the pool, which also included one officer and four enlisted men selected from the division at large. This pool repeated most of the checking that new men had received at the forward replacement battalions, including the zeroing of rifles. Additional pool camps were operated in the three regimental sections and another one was maintained in the special troops section. These camps gave new arrivals a chance to learn many lessons from experienced soldiers. The success of this 79th Division pool caused the 44th Infantry and 100th Infantry Divisions, as well as some of the other XV Corps units to adopt similar methods. According to U.S. Army G-2 intelligence the 361st Volksgrenadier Division released a report on 25 October 1944 that stated: \\"The 79th Division is said to have fought particularly well in Normandy and is considered as one of the best attack divisions of the U. S. Army.\\" Well-liked by his soldiers, Wyche was known as the \\"Doughboy's General\\", and called 'Papa' Wyche by his soldiers, as a result of his daily inspections of the Division's camp. For his service, he received the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star and the Legion of Merit. Wyche left command of the division on 20 May 1945, after which he commanded VIII Corps until December 1945, when he took command of III Corps, leaving in May 1946. He was later a member of the Press Integration Interview Board and Officer Interview Board. In May 1946, Wyche took command of the 1st Service Command, which he held until 30 January 1947. Wyche then became the Inspector General of the U. S. Army in January, receiving the permanent rank of major general. While inspector general, he investigated charges raised by newspaper columnist Robert Ruark against Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, that he misused enlisted men under his command in occupied Italy. Wyche exonerated Lee in a report he issued in October 1947. The 12,000 word report concluded that Ruark had presented a \\"wholly false picture of conditions.\\" He retired from the office and army service on 30 September 1948.

He served as Minister of Foreign Trade from November 1973 to September 1981 and was an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Born into a prominent family in Changshu, as a student in Shanghai he joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) during the May Thirtieth Movement in 1925, and became a key technical specialist in the early history of the CPC. After Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang (KMT) massacred the Communists in 1927, Li was recruited by Zhou Enlai as the communications head of Teke, the CPC's intelligence agency, and created the CPC's first underground radio station. After his close friend and colleague Gu Shunzhang defected to the KMT in 1931, Li was forced into exile in the Soviet Union, where he studied to become a radio expert and published a book on rhombic antenna. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Li established an arms industry in the CPC's rural base in Yan'an and headed the Yan'an Natural Science Institute. During the ensuing Chinese Civil War, he continued to oversee the CPC's arms industry and established a shortwave radio station for the Xinhua News Agency. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Li served for three decades in the Ministry of Foreign Trade. As Vice-Minister, he played a major role in providing aid to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War and secretly visited the Ho Chi Minh trail. After becoming Minister of Foreign Trade in 1973, he signed hundreds of major deals to import Western technology and machinery and helped modernize China's economy.  Republican era  = Early life and education = Li Qiang was born as on 26 September 1905 in Changshu, Jiangsu, Qing dynasty. Originally named Zeng Peihong () with the courtesy name Youfan (), he was a member of the prominent Zeng clan of Changsu, said to be descended from Zengzi, a major disciple of Confucius. He studied at Zongwen School in Hangzhou, but was expelled in 1923 for writing an article criticizing Confucianist traditions. He moved to Shanghai and enrolled at Nanyang Road and Mining School, which used English as its language of instruction, and studied under the Kuomintang (KMT) elder Ye Chucang. = May Thirtieth Movement = Li became a Communist during the May Thirtieth Movement, which began when the British police of the Shanghai International Settlement opened fire on Chinese protesters, killing 11. He joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in August 1925 and made dynamite and grenades in July 1926 to prepare for the in support of Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition from Guangzhou. He is thus considered a founder of Communist China's arms industry. In March 1927, when the Northern Expedition army took over Changshu, Li was appointed as a member of the temporary executive committee of his hometown. = Special Service Section (Teke) = On 12 April 1927, Chiang Kai-shek's KMT launched a coup against his Communist allies and massacred them in Shanghai. The surviving Communists went underground and established its intelligence agency, the Special Service Section (known by its Chinese abbreviation Teke), led by Zhou Enlai. Because of Li's experience in bomb-making and his familiarity with Shanghai's Green Gang, Zhou and Gu Shunzhang recruited him into Teke and made him head of communications, one of Teke's four divisions. Li developed a close friendship with Gu, head of the Red Squad or Teke's assassination team, and Chen Geng, head of intelligence. They worked together in the failed mission to rescue the captured Communist leader Peng Pai, but successfully assassinated Bai Xin, the turncoat who had betrayed Peng. In 1928, Zhou resolved to establish an underground radio station in Shanghai to communicate with CPC bases in the rest of the country. Li was assigned the task because of his technical background and proficiency in English, as few Chinese books on radio technology were available at the time and radio equipment was strictly controlled by the KMT. Despite having no prior knowledge about radios, he taught himself by reading English books and studying telegraph transmitters. He successfully made a radio transmitter in 1929 and established the CPC's first underground radio station later that year. He then went to Hong Kong to establish a radio station in the British colony. When Deng Xiaoping transited in Hong Kong on his way to lead the Baise Uprising in Guangxi, Li co-ordinated with him to facilitate communication between Guangxi and the CPC leadership in Shanghai. = Exile in the Soviet Union = In April 1931, Gu Shunzhang, the head of the Red Squad, defected after he was captured by the KMT in Wuhan. Thanks to the quick reactions of Qian Zhuangfei and Li Kenong, Teke's moles in the KMT intelligence organization, the CPC leadership in Shanghai was able to evacuate before the arrival of KMT agents. As Gu was intimately familiar with Li Qiang's life, Zhou Enlai arranged to have Li leave for the Soviet Union. In Moscow, Li planned to study at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, which was attended by many CPC leaders, including Liu Shaoqi, Luo Yinong, and Ren Bishi. However, Wang Ming, the CPC leader in Moscow, deeply distrusted Li because of his close relationship with Gu Shunzhang. He kept Li out of the university and prevented him from returning to China. Li instead joined the Communication Science Research Institute and devoted his next six years studying radio theory and technology. He published a book on rhombic antenna in English, and was recognized as one of the top radio experts in the Soviet Union. The book was later translated into Chinese and used as a textbook in Chinese universities. = Second Sino-Japanese War and Chinese Civil War = After the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Li was granted permission to return to China at the end of 1937, as his technical expertise was urgently needed by the Communist headquarters in Yan'an. He was appointed head of the Bureau of Military Industry, tasked with establishing an arms industry in rural Yan'an. In 1939, the Bureau of Military Industry created the CPC's first self-made rifle, a Type 79 rifle. By 1943, the bureau had manufactured nearly 10,000 rifles, 1,500 grenade launchers and many other weapons. During the Yan'an Rectification Movement, Li protected top technical experts such as and from persecution. In May 1944, he was appointed President of Yan'an Natural Science Institute, the CPC's first technical university, and reformed its curriculum to serve industrial and agricultural production. During the Chinese Civil War, Li oversaw arms production in Communist- controlled areas. He also established a shortwave radio station for the Xinhua News Agency to broadcast messages from the CPC leadership.  People's Republic of China  = From 1949 to the Cultural Revolution = After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Li was appointed Director of the General Administration of Radio and the General Administration of Telecommunications. Because of his technical expertise and proficiency in Russian, in August 1952 Mao Zedong appointed Li as Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade and Commercial Counselor at the Chinese embassy in Moscow. He was elected as a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1955. From April 1956 to October 1958, he served concurrently as a member of the Aviation Industry Committee of the Ministry of National Defense. In March 1961, he was appointed vice-chairman of the Commission of Foreign Economic Relations (later Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations). He also held positions in the China Electronics Society and the Electronics Research Institute. = Vietnam War = During the Cultural Revolution, Premier Zhou Enlai protected Li Qiang by assigning a high-ranking People's Liberation Army officer to his office and appointing another soldier as his secretary. During the Vietnam War, Li was a key member of the CPC's leading group overseeing China's aid to North Vietnam, which was crucial to its victory against the United States. In late 1970, he secretly visited the Ho Chi Minh trail to inspect the transport route of North Vietnamese troops to South Vietnam. In 1972, Li informed North Vietnam that China agreed to supply and ship critical weaponry and ammunition they requested for fighting in South Vietnam. Li's role in the Vietnam War helped shield him from attacks by the Red Guards. = Minister of Foreign Trade = In October 1973, Li was promoted to Minister of Foreign Trade, replacing Bai Xiangguo, who had been dismissed. MFT was a large, important ministry with many layers of organization, which served not only commercial, but also diplomatic functions. Li was appointed partly because China became interested in importing Western technology. Yao Yilin, who later became a vice-premier and Politburo member, served as his deputy. Li's eight-year tenure as Minister of Foreign Trade witnessed the improvement of China's foreign relations with the West. By October 1977, he had signed 197 deals to import technology and machinery from many Western countries, which greatly helped modernize China's industry, agriculture, and national defence. After the fall of the Gang of Four, he politically rehabilitated more than 2,000 people in his ministry who had been denounced and persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. Li retired in September 1981, although he continued to hold many honorary positions afterwards. Li was a member of the 9th, 10th, and 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and of the 12th Central Advisory Commission. He was also a member of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th National People's Congress.  Personal life  Li was married to Wei Huantu (). They had two sons, Li Yanming () and Li Xiaoqiang (), and a daughter, Li Xiaotu (). Li was diagnosed with liver cancer in 1991. He died in Beijing on 29 September 1996, three days after his 91st birthday. He was buried in the Yushan Scenic Area in his hometown Changshu.

Background New Zealand Cricket established the Shell Conference in 1997 in response to two problems. First, the Shell Trophy (also known as the Plunket Shield), the first-class competition contested by the six major association teams, was becoming expensive to run in its double round robin format. Second, it was felt that the standard of New Zealand cricket would be improved by holding a competition in which the six teams combined to make three teams, and adding a team from overseas to make a four-team single round robin format. The three domestic teams were: * Northern Conference, which selected its players from Northern Districts and Auckland * Central Conference, which selected its players from Central Districts and Wellington * Southern Conference, which selected its players from Canterbury and Otago The overseas teams were Bangladesh in 1997-98 and Pakistan A in 1998-99. The format was abandoned after the 1998-99 season. In 2000-01 the Plunket Shield resumed its place as New Zealand’s only first-class competition, returning to its double round robin format. Playing record Northern Conference played seven first-class matches, winning two, drawing four and losing one. They played four List A matches, winning the first two and losing the next two. 1997-98: Captained by Dion Nash, Northern Conference won the first-class competition in 1997-98. They won their first two matches—Bangladesh by an innings and Southern Conference by 86 runs—and finished on top of the table after the round robin, then drew the final against Southern Conference with a first-innings lead.Wisden 1999, pp. 1316–17. Of the seven centuries scored in the competition, Northern Conference batsmen scored four: two to Mark Bailey and one each to Nash and Blair Pocock. Of the 10 bowlers who took 10 or more wickets in the competition, four were Northern Conference bowlers, of whom Mark Haslam had the best average, 13 wickets at 13.23. 1998-99: Again captained by Nash in 1998-99, Northern Conference drew their first match when a sub-standard pitch caused its abandonment, and drew their last, which was curtailed by rain. In between they lost by an innings to Central Conference. They finished last. None of their batsmen scored a century, and their best bowler was Daniel Vettori, who took nine wickets.Wisden 2000, pp. 1342–43.

Local fans have named him after German goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer for his excellent goalkeeping skills and perfect ball control with his feet.  Early career Born in Monrovia, Montserrado County, Williams started playing football in his local community in Monrovia, Logan Town where he started playing as a defender. The young potential kid began his career at age 12 when he joined a local community team, Duke Football Club. He played at the Left-back position with the community club before joining another community youth club, Bassa Town Young Controller. He joined the club in 2014 and switch his position from playing at left-back to the goalkeeping position because of the club lack of goalkeeper. The decision to go in goal worked out for the then 14-year-old who performed excellently. He remained as a goalkeeper and led the club to playing in the third division league where he was spotted by Liberia First Division club, LISCR FC that showed interest in signing him for their feeder team, Gardnersville Football Club that plays in the second division of Liberian football. =Gardnersville Football Club= LISCR FC succeeded in signing the left-back turned goalkeeper in 2015 and sent him to Gardnersville Football Club for development. The young goalkeeper was immediately given a place in the team upon his arrival after then Gardnersville Football Club first choice goalkeeper, Gabriel Okotie was promoted to LISCR FC. Despite his debut season in the second tier of Liberian football where he played against some top players, he managed to put out some brilliant performances which caught the attention of LISCR FC head coach, Tapha Manneh who invited him to train with LISCR FC during the first phase break of the 2016–17 Liberia First Division. After more than two weeks of intensive training sessions, Williams performances pleased Tapha Manneh who awarded him a place in the team. His promotion to LISCR FC saw Gibriel Okotie returning to Gardnersville Football Club as he became the third choice goalkeeper behind Tommy Songo and Prince Wlame. =LISCR FC= Williams' early dream of becoming one of the best Liberian left-back had faded away as he found himself between the sticks. However, it was a good decision for him with his continuous improvement in goal. In three years, he excelled from the third division to the top tier of Liberian football playing for on the country's best club. It was another dream that came through for Williams but his playing time reduced with a strong competition with Tommy Songo and Prince Wlame. Two months after his promotion to LISCR FC, he made his debut in the Liberian Cup second round against Muscat FC. He played all 90 minute as LISCR FC and Muscat FC played to a 4–4 draw, a result which sent LISCR FC to the Liberian Cup third round with a 7–3 aggregate. He was part of the LISCR FC team that won the 2016–17 Liberia First Division with an unbeaten record and also won the Liberian Cup. His debut year with LISCR FC turned out to be a successful one with two major trophies. Ahead of LISCR FC 2018 CAF Champions League preliminary round games against Al-Hilal Club (Omdurman), he featured and played a key role in helping LISCR FC to win two preseason the LISCR Trust Tournament and the Liberia Diaspora Tournament which were preseason tournaments. He missed out making playing in the 2018 CAF Champions League after not being included in the 18-man squad for the LISCR FC 1–0 win at the Antoinette Tubman Stadium and the 3–0 defeat in the return leg at the Blue Jewel Stadium in Sudan. International career Williams might not have had the opportunity to played a competitive game for LISCR FC, but his performances during the preseason never went unnoticed by Liberia U20 head coach, Christopher Wreh who called him to the team's training sessions ahead of the 2018 WAFU/FOX U-20 Tournament. He made the list of the provisional 25-players before making the final 18-man team for the tournament. He made his debut for the Liberia U20 on the opening day of the tournament with a spectacular performance in goal. Unfortunate for Williams', Liberia lost 3–0 to Ivory Coast U20 despite managing eight saves. Despite the defeat, he kept the confidence and helped the Liberia U20 bounced back to defeat with a 2–1 win. Liberia U20 qualified from the group stage to the semifinals with a 5–1 win over Sierra Leone U20. It was another match for the youngster that performed excellently in goal. Not only his goalkeeping skills, but Williams won the heart of the many fans with his perfect feet-work. He would control the ball perfectly and take on his opponents with his dribbling ability. On May 2, Williams kept a clean-sheet as Liberia beat Mali to reach the final of the 2018 WAFU/FOX U-20 Tournament.

A previous unit with the same designation was organized in 1989, headquartered at Sycamore and then Machesney Park as part of the 404th Chemical Brigade before its 1997 inactivation.  History  A unit with the same designation was headquartered at Sycamore as part of the 404th Chemical Brigade, organized on 1 July 1989 and activated in September of that year. It included the 244th Chemical Company (Smoke) at Rockford and the 444th Chemical Company (Decontamination) at Freeport, and the latter's Detachment 1 at Galva. After returning from summer training at Fort McCoy in August 1993, the 62-man headquarters of the battalion was mobilized for flood relief duty along the Mississippi River at Quincy in response to the Great Flood of 1993. It was relocated to Machesney Park on 1 October 1995; the Sycamore armory was taken over by the newly activated Battery C, 2nd Battalion, 122nd Field Artillery. The battalion was officially inactivated by orders effective 1 September 1997 along with the brigade. The current battalion was constituted 1 September 2005 in the Illinois Army National Guard as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 44th Chemical Battalion, and three years later organized and Federally recognized on 5 August 2008. The battalion initially included the 135th Chemical Company at Machesney Park, the 444th Chemical Company (Combat Support) at Monmouth, and the 445th Chemical Company at East St. Louis. Before being constituted it was on Carrier status. After 2007 the 444th Chemical Company was relocated to the new Galesburg Readiness Center.

Parental investment theory states that parents and their offspring will often be in conflict over the optimal amount of investment that the parent should provide. This is because the best interests of the parent do not always match the best interests of the offspring. Maternal-infant conflict is of interest due to the intensity of maternal investment in her offspring. In humans, mothers often invest years of care into their children due to the long developmental period before children become self-sufficient. Parents and their children are typically engaged in a cooperative venture in which both benefit by the survival and future reproduction of the offspring. However, their interests cannot be identical because their genes are not identical. While both parent and offspring are 100% related to themselves, they share only 50% of their genes with each other, which means both parent and child will at times be in conflict with each other.  Intrauterine conflict  Maternal-infant conflict begins during pregnancy, where the mother’s body must maintain her own health while also providing for the developing fetus. Broadly, both the fetus and the mother have the same evolutionary interests in the fetus coming to term and resulting in a healthy birth. However, there may also be conflicts between the amount of nutrients the fetus prefers to receive and the amount the mother prefers to give. For example, there may be conflict between the mother and the fetus over who should controls fetal growth, wherein the fetus would prefer optimal growth and the mother would prefer to control fetal growth relative to the level of resources she has available. = Role of the placenta = The placenta plays an important role in this conflict since it is the source of nutrient delivery from mother to fetus, and also receives signals from both mother and fetus. The placenta is believed to play a balancing role in the conflict between mother and fetus, and confers optimal fitness to the fetus given the developmental constraints of the mother's resource availability. For instance, Rutherford and Tardiff suggested that in marmosets with variable litter sizes, litters of triplets were associated with smaller shares of the placenta each, suggesting that the fetuses were able to increase placental efficiency, perhaps by manipulating placental structure and function to solicit additional maternal resources, in the face of competition between the fetuses for limited maternal resources. However, they also note that the infrequency of successful gestation and weaning of complete triplet litters suggests that even in the face of a fetal mechanism for efficiency, maternal mechanisms may otherwise constrain energetic investments, perhaps especially after birth. A key discovery related to both intrauterine and intragenomic conflict is that the fetal genotype can influence maternal physiology. Fetal manipulation of the maternal endometrium allows the fetus to gain access to maternal arterial blood. Through this manipulation, the mother cannot restrict blood flow to the fetus without restricting blood flow to herself. When mothers are unable to defend against fetal alterations, development of pregnancy related syndromes such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia occur. Gestational diabetes occurs when higher blood glucose leads to increased production of insulin in response to fetally-influenced resistance to insulin. Pre-eclampsia is high blood pressure that occurs during pregnancy which may be the result of fetal manipulations which increase blood flow.  Genomic imprinting  Genomic imprinting refers to the different effects of the same gene depending on whether the gene was inherited from one's mother or father. While most genes do not have different effects based on their parental origin, a small subset do. These genes are referred to as imprinted. Imprinting arises when the effect of the gene's expression in the offspring is likely to have a strong effect on a parent's fitness. For example, genes which are implicated in the offspring's acquisition of resources from the mother are strongly beneficial to the father's fitness because his offspring who have genes which are highly successful at acquiring the mother's resources are likely to survive and reproduce. Furthermore, the father pays no direct cost of breastfeeding the infant whereas the mother does pay the cost. In this case, the father's copy of these genes should be selected to acquire more resources than the mother's copy of these genes. Currently, there are around 100 known imprinted genes in mice, and 50 in humans. Some imprinted genes appear to have no effect, or if the gene is clearly related to function the imprinted expression of the gene does not. As with intrauterine conflict, genomic imprinting is believed to be highly related to placentation, because evidence of genomic imprinting is found only in placental mammals, leading to the hypothesis that genomic imprinting and placentation are evolutionarily linked. Imprinted gene expression is shown to be integral to normal development and functioning of the placenta. Furthermore, the web of signaling which is expressed between fetus, placenta, and maternal hypothalamus is likely the result of co-adaptations of gene expression related to fetal growth and brain development. = Disorders of imprinting = The discovery of the genomic imprinting phenomenon helped researchers to understand the basis for several disorders with otherwise unclear inheritance patterns including Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome, and Silver-Russell Syndrome. Disorders of imprinting are thought to be related to abnormal DNA methylation, which may involve multiple imprinted loci. Evidence that assistive-reproductive technology and peri-conceptional environmental factors such as maternal diet are implicated in imprinting-related disorders draws a link between oocyte health and proper imprinting development.  Prader-Willi Syndrome and Angelman Syndrome  Prader-Willi and Angelman Syndromes are genetic disorders which are caused when the only copy of an imprinted gene is the 'silent' copy and the active copy is absent, either due to a deletion or to uniparental disomy. Both are due to the absence of gene expression at 15q11–q13, wherein Prader-Willi is believed to reflect the absence of the paternally derived gene, and Angelman Syndrome reflects the absence of the maternal copy. In the case of Prader-Willi Syndrome, the paternal copy is absent while the maternal 'silent' copy is present. Prader-Willi Syndrome is characterized by low birth weight, hypersomnolence, low appetite and poor suckling. The child typically develops a voracious appetite around 1-2 years of age which typically leads to early onset obesity. Children with Prader- Willi Syndrome typically have reduced height throughout childhood and absence of pubertal growth.  Kinship theory  A paradigm used to study genomic imprinting is kinship theory. Kinship theory argues that imprinting evolves due to conflicts between the interests of paternal and maternal genes within an infant, specifically in regards to infant use of maternal resources. Mothers can have children who have different fathers, therefore paternally- derived genes are expected to exploit maternal resources in favor of offspring growth, while maternally-derived genes are expected to constrain maternal resource allocation in order to spread resources over multiple offspring. Through kinship theory, the occurrence of Prader-Willi Syndrome is theorized to result from the absence of the paternally derived gene, and the only copy is the maternally 'silent' copy. In this case, the child is expected to express behaviors which reduced maternal costs in evolutionary history. In particular, a reduction of infant feeding responses and low appetite over the period of years when the child would near completely rely on breastmilk from its mother would allow mothers to allocate their resources across themselves and multiple offspring. Breastfeeding an infant is estimated to cost around an additional 500 kcals per day, if additional energy is not consumed during lactation, body stores are used making breastfeeding a costly maternal endeavor. Low appetite in early age is followed by a sudden onset of appetite and feeding behaviors around age 2. In traditional subsistence communities, this corresponds with the age that children would be weaned from breastmilk and offered supplementary solid foods. It is likely that these weaning foods were less directly costly to the mother than breastfeeding, either because gathering these food items were less energetically costly for her to gather, or she could rely on social partners to assist her in gathering the food. Therefore, Prader-Willi allows us to see the roles of normally invisible imprinting effects which arose in relation to ancestral parental provisioning conflicts. In typically-developing individuals, the imprinted genes related to Prader-Willi and Angelman Syndrome are balanced in a \\"tug-of-war\\" designed by natural selection. However, when one of these genes is missing the balance is disrupted and the effects result in the phenotypes seen in these disorders. = Menopause = Some authors have argued that variability in the timing of onset and the symptom expression of menopause may represent intragenomic conflict. Human female reproductive capacity ends around age 50, which is around two decades earlier than women's expected lifespans, including in communities without access to medical care. Many have questioned why menopause evolved, since women who did not experience menopause would be able to increase their fitness by extending their reproductive capacities and having more children. The Grandmother Hypothesis argues that menopause evolved because it is an adaptation which increases a woman's fitness through inclusive fitness, that is promoting her genes through her relatives such as her grandchildren. Selective forces related to the onset of menopause may be different between paternal and maternal interests. Ecological differences in female-biased dispersal patterns in ancestral environments may be related to current difference between populations as to the onset and symptomatology of menopause. If so, women whose ancestors evolved in populations with lower female bias in dispersal will be more likely to experience more severe symptoms and earlier menopause than women whose ancestors evolved in populations with higher female bias in dispersal.

History The WCPF first met in Medellín, Colombia in July, 2017. With aclose to 1,500 attendees from more than 40 countries, the main focus of the forum was to discuss a range of topics concerning the sustainability of the global coffee value chain and in the decline in coffee farmers’ incomes. Among the topics discussed was the need to take action to improve producers’ incomes through joint work with the rest of the supply chain on initiatives that will translate into increased consumption and higher coffee prices. Other topics addressed at the meeting included the consequences of climate change and measures to enhance productivity in coffee-producing countries. In April, 2018 it was announced that the executive committee of the WCPF has started the process of formalizing the structure of the WCPF as a not-for-profit. The non profit will represent the economic stability of coffee farmers. It will address and raise awareness of the challenges of the coffee value chain, especially those related to the economic and social situation of coffee growers. Events =2017= The first forum was held in Medellín, Colombia, in July 2017 and consisted of close to 1,500 attendees from over 40 different coffee-producing countries. Speakers and panelists included industry leaders, economists, analysts, leaders of several Latin American countries, as well as former US President Bill Clinton. The keynote speaker was Prof. Jeffrey D. Sachs. As a coordinator of the forum, the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation (FNC) in New York commissioned the Columbia Center for Sustainable Investments (CCSI) under the leadership of Professor Sachs a study about \\"Economic and Policy Analysis for Improving Smallholder Coffee Producers' Income\\". The conclusions will be presented at the WCPF meeting in Campinas by Professor Sachs. The focus of the forum was the intersection of coffee and sustainable development, specifically economic sustainability, rural development and socioeconomic indicators, and adaptation to climate change. The forum explored these topics through moderated panel discussions on the first day and focused working groups on the second day. This conversational structure of the forum was meant to encourage dialogue between experts and the attendees, many of whom were coffee farmers from around the world, rather than a simple transfer of information, such as a lecture. =2019= With the announcement of the intent to form a not-for-profit, the next event was scheduled for July 10 and 11. It will take place in Campinas, Brazil. Consequently, the event was held and the final declaration from this year's forum is as follows: In the city of Campinas, Brazil, on July 10 and 11, 2019, the second forum of coffee- producing countries was held, and considering: 1\\\\. That the first Forum raised worldwide awareness to the need for economic sustainability in global coffee supply. However, there has not been effective engagement from the other sectors in the coffee value chain to improve coffee producers’ remuneration. 2\\\\. That research by professor Jeffery Sachs from Columbia University highlighted the need for interaction among all agents in the value chain for the development of global actions in addition to those already carried out in each country, with co-responsibility of all public and private agents in the coffee trade to guarantee the implementation of sustainability in its economic, environmental and social dimensions. 3\\\\. The opportunity for development of new technologies to improve the traditional forms of commercializing coffee, bringing producers and consumers closer and aggregating value to origins. 4\\\\. The importance in stimulating global coffee consumption, especially in producing countries and emerging markets, to guarantee balance between supply and demand and, consequently, remunerative prices to coffee producers. Resolved: 1\\\\. To promote the creation of a technological platform to aggregate and make available information and numbers to all segments of the coffee value chain, in a manner that creates transparency in business and price formulation. 2\\\\. To develop a mechanism that facilitates the availability of information from producing origins through traceability of offered products and their specificities to end consumers. 3\\\\. To promote the training of producers through technical assistance and rural extension for the professionalization in property management and the acquisition of knowledge about market risks. 4\\\\. To stimulate the development of innovative strategies and campaigns to promote coffee consumption, mainly in producing countries and emerging markets. 5\\\\. To develop mechanisms, marketing strategies and technological innovations that enable achieving remunerative prices for producers, such as “economic sustainability” and “roasted by origin” seals. 6\\\\. To encourage each producer origin, at public and private levels, to develop national plans for sustainability for the coffee sector. 7\\\\. That the WCPF Committee will move forward with creating a legal entity to plan and execute on the strategies in this declaration. 8\\\\. The next World Coffee Producers Forum shall be held in 2021. The committee shall coordinate with the countries which city shall hold the next event. This declaration was made in Campinas on 11 July 2019.Brown, N. (2019, July 18).
