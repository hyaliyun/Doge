Uses It was at one-time, but is no longer distributed by the Center for Disease Control on a compassionate use basis as an investigational drug for the treatment of metronidazole-resistant amoebiasis. =Amoebic infections= Some examples of the use of dehydroemetine in the treatment of amoebic infections include: # In 1993, the successful treatment of cutaneous amebiasis in a 7-year-old girl with dehydroemetine and metronidazole in Mexico. # A double- blind study of oral dehydroemetine in the treatment of amoebiasis performed at St. Mary's Hospital, Catholic Medical College, Seoul, Republic of Korea in 1973-1974 showed dehydroemetine treatment was effective. A total of 60 patients were treated, 20 with dehydroemetine, 20 with Tiberal, and 20 with metronidazole. One-fourth of the patients treated with dehydroemetine reported adverse reactions, compared to 20% with other drugs, but no patient discontinued therapy due to the reaction. In all three cases, the drug therapy resulted in clearance of the infection, defined as negative results through an O&P; exam, in all but 1-2 patients. # A 1979 study of 27 patients treated with dehydroemetine and various other drugs suggested all drug combinations were successful at treating amoebic liver abscesses. # A 1986 in vitro study compared the effects of dehydroemetine, metronidazole, ornidazole, and secnidazole on Entamoeba histolytica. Metronidazole was found to be most effective, and the other three drugs were of similar effectiveness. =In other diseases= A 2020 in-vitro study found dehydroemetine to be effective in malaria. A 1980 report described the use of dehydroemetine in treatment of herpes zoster, a condition which can produce painful neurological symptoms. The study involved 40 patients, all of whom were over 60, and compared dehydroemetine treatment to another drug. The study reported patients treated with dehydroemetine experienced relief of neuralgia with no changes in cardiovascular functions.

He competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Ricardo is widely considered to be one of the best setters of all time, mainly for his ability to manipulate the opposing teams' blockers and create easy hitting opportunities for his attackers. Along with Brazilian head coach Bernardo Rezende, Ricardo is credited with creating the fast paced offense, including extremely quick back row attacks and fast paced sets to all positions on the court. This offense has been adopted by all major international teams and is consistently used at the highest levels today. Although Ricardo is widely considered one of the greatest setters, many experts have questioned his 'natural athleticism'. Ricardo was not particularly quick on his feet, and was not able block at a height necessary of stopping opposing attackers. However, due to the skill level of the Brazilian team during Ricardo's career, the team was able to create a defensive strategy in which Ricardo rarely blocked and was able to focus almost solely on setting. Garcia was born in S√£o Paulo. In 2004, he was part of the Brazilian team which won the gold medal in the Olympic tournament. He played all eight matches. In 2007 he was dismissed from the team, reportedly because of contention with other team members. He rejoined the team for the 2012 Olympics in London where they won the silver medal.

It is dedicated to Paraskevi of Iconium (Paraskeva Pyatnitsa).  History  Before the arrival of the Cossacks, a pagan temple of the Tatars was located in the current place of the chapel. The Cossacks placed on the top of the mountain a watchtower to notify citizens about hostile raids. In 1805 a merchant named Novikov constructed a wooden chapel on that place out of gratitude for being saved from a whirlpool of rapids. Another version about the construction of the building states that the local inhabitants built the chapel due to the deliverance of their ancestors from their enemies. However this building became decrepit after some time. In 1852 the bishop of Tomsky, Afanasy, gave permission to the city Duma for the building of a stone chapel. Between 1852 and 1855 it was built by architects Ya. Alfeev and Ya. Nabalov from the funds of the prominent owner of gold mines and patron of art, Pyotr Kuznetsov. In 1887 the Russian scientist and radio inventor Aleksander Popov observed the solar eclipse from the chapel. In memory of this in 1977, on the East front of the building a granite memorial plaque was placed. The chapel was abandoned during the Soviet era. Between 1973 and 1975 the building was restored with the projects of A.S. Brusnikin. In 2014 the chapel was recoloured to green, according to its historical colour.

Biography Jacques Ehrmann was born in Mulhouse (Haut- Rhin, France) on March 31, 1931, the son of Paul Ehrmann and Henriette Weber. Born in the Alsace region by a twist of fate, as both the Ehrmann and Weber families were originally from Alsace but had left after the 1871 loss to Germany, it just happened that Mulhouse, then Strasbourg, were the first assignments of his father, an Engineering graduate from \\"√âcole Polytechnique\\". The family, including his older brother Jean-Daniel (JD), came back to Paris in 1939 and he graduated from the Lyc√©e Henri IV with a Baccalaur√©at in 1949, then studied at the Sorbonne where he obtained a Licence-des-Lettres in 1953. In the meantime, he received a Fulbright scholarship and spent an academic year from 1951 to 1952 at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, the \\"City of Colleges, Cows and Contentment\\", a logo he loved to quote. He was called to military service from 1953 to 1955 and served in the \\"R√©giment de Tirailleurs Alg√©riens\\", and later as a translator in Germany for the US headquarters. During this time he met Pierre Riboulet who would go on to create the French architectural firm l'Atelier de Montrouge with G√©rard Thurnauer (1926) and Jean-Louis V√©ret (1927) with whom he became lifelong friends while furthering his deep interest in Architecture. In 1956 he married Fran√ßoise Laborie and the couple moved to Los Angeles where he attended The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and received a PhD in French Literature in 1961. There he met and befriended Raymond Federman with whom he perfected his tennis game. From 1959 to 1961 he taught at Pomona College in Claremont California while completing his doctoral dissertation. Concurrently working as a freelance correspondent for France Presse he was offered a full-time assignment in New York City at the same time as he was invited to join the Yale University Faculty. Having to choose between journalism and academia, he chose Yale University in 1961. He lived in Hamden, Connecticut, with his wife and two sons. As full professor he taught there in the French and Comparative Literature Departments and edited three issues of the \\"Yale French Studies\\" review which were later published as books. He was very involved in academic activities including lectures, conferences, and colloquia ... and continued to work through a long illness until his premature death on June 11, 1972.

Overview The Patras Fortress () was built around the mid-6th century A.D above the ruins of the ancient acropolis of the city of Patras, on a low outlying hill of the Panachaiko Mountain and ca. 800 m from the sea. The castle covers 22,725 m¬≤ and consists of a triangular outer wall, strengthened by towers and gates and further protected originally by a moat, and an inner compound on the northeastern corner, also protected by a moat. The first castle on the spot was built by Byzantine emperor Justinian I after the catastrophic earthquake of 551, re-using building material from pre- Christian structures. One of these spolia, the torso and head of a marble Roman statue, became part of the city's folklore, a sort of genius loci. It is known as the \\"Patrinella\\", a maiden who is supposed to have been transformed into a man during Ottoman times, guards the city against disease and weeps whenever a prominent citizen of Patras dies. The fort remained in constant use thereafter, even until the Second World War. In the Byzantine period, it was besieged by Slavs, Saracens, Normans and many others, but it never fell. In particular, the successful repulsion of a great siege of 805 AD by the Arabs and the Slavs was attributed to the city's patron saint, St Andrew. In 1205, in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, it was taken over by the Franks, who strengthened it further, opening a moat on all three sides. In 1278, the Principality of Achaea pawned it to the local Latin (Catholic) Archbishop, while the Pope leased it to the Venetians for five years in 1408. The Latin Archbishop remained in possession of the castle until 1430, when it was taken by the Despot of the Morea and future last Byzantine emperor, Constantine Palaiologos, who made extensive repairs to its walls. The castle fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1458, and remained one of their main seats of power in the Peloponnese throughout the Tourkokratia. The Venetians took the castle in 1687 during the Morean War, and kept it until the Morea was retaken by the Turks in 1715. Following independence, the castle remained in use by the Greek Army until after World War II. In 1973, the castle was turned over to the 6th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities. It is used nowadays for cultural events, especially during summer, and features a theatre with a capacity of 640 seats.

The term contrasts this computer file with the physical copy (typically a DVD, Blu-ray or Ultra HD Blu-ray disc) with which the digital copy is usually offered as part of a bundle. It allows the disc's purchaser to acquire a single copy of the film on digital device such as a personal computer, smartphone, tablet, and/or digital media player, and view it on those devices (and often across all of them with one account) without requiring access to the physical media. \\"Digital copy\\" is also commonly referred to as \\"Digital HD\\" (where it is referencing a high- definition or UHD digital copy). Features There are three types of a digital copy. The first is a copy made in advance and included on the disc. The second is created dynamically from the DVD content itself. In both scenarios the publisher decides which content, formats, digital rights management (DRM) systems and technical parameters are used for the Digital Copy. Digital Copy systems based on existing pre-generated files are less flexible than dynamic transcoding solutions. The third version is an alphanumeric code included on a slip of paper within the physical film's keep case, which is typed in and redeemed at an online portal which allows the customer to download the film at the store of their choice, using their own bandwidth, or stream it through a cloud service at the time of viewing as part of a retailer's digital locker where the customer retains permanent access to the film's digital file. In the past with the first two types, the digital copy files based on existing files included only the main audio track (often only stereo) and no subtitles, compared to the multiple audio tracks and multiple subtitle options available from DVD and Blu-ray. Also, the quality was limited by the bitrate used to encode the file which is typically relatively low and not adjusted to the device to be transferred to. Bonus features were also unavailable for the most part until online movie stores were able to include them as bonus files with the download. Digital copy files based on transcoding solutions can use the correct audio track and subtitle based on the user's location or choice and individually create the digital copy based on the target device properties (video and audio bitrate, display resolution, aspect ratio and device utilize for viewing the copy). Most often, digital copy solutions mainly offered Apple iTunes files with their respective DRM services, with Windows Media with Windows Media DRM and FairPlay also used, but due to the latter's lack of success in the market, most digital copies utilized iTunes. Other solutions also provided support for Sony PlayStation Portable and pre-smartphone age feature phones using 3GP video files and Open Mobile Alliance DRM. Some publishers limited their digital copies to Microsoft operating systems and devices. To limit the number of free copies, the disc typically comes with a single-use alphanumeric code to authenticate the ownership of the title over the Internet; some versions of the concept come with a QR code containing the single-use code in order to allow it to be scanned by a smartphone camera, saving the user time from having to type in the long code, which may contain homoglyphs that may be typed in wrong. Often the authentication code may have an expiration date, rendering the copy invalid if it the redemption code is fulfilled after that time. In common practice, most codes have remained available to redeem well after the printed expiration date, in order to keep customer goodwill and avoid complaints about the inability to redeem a code for a title which continues to sell older stock. Over time, this became the preferred method of digital copy validation over including a disc digital file in the package. Reception Technology industry analyst Michael Gartenberg described the digital copy initiative as \\"a smart move\\" providing an easier alternative to customers compared to converting the files themselves using software such as HandBrake. Gartenberg was critical of Sony for restricting themselves to files for the PlayStation Portable that were not widely compatible with more popular personal media devices, such as iOS devices. Fred von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation described digital copy schemes as \\"stealing your fair use rights and selling them back to you piecemeal\\", disputing claims by Hollywood studios that it is illegal for customers to rip a personal copy of a DVD to put on a portable video player, even if they own the DVD. Jon Healey of the Los Angeles Times pointed out that, with DVDs, consumers were being asked to pay more for uses they had before at no extra cost with CDs and cassette tapes. Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols of ComputerWorld.com describes digital copy as \\"nonsense, a feature that is no feature at all.\\" He criticizes it as an attempt by the industry to sugar-coat DRM, complaining that viewers should be able to watch the movie they have bought on any device they want, and that media companies should change their business plans to meet their customers' legitimate needs.

Rotenhan Castle () is a castle ruin about two kilometres north of the village of Eyrichshof in Lower Franconia in the south German state of Bavaria. Eyrichshof lies within the borough of Ebern in the district of Ha√überge. The castle is the ancestral home (Stammsitz) of the House of Rotenhan, a family of imperial knights.  History  The Rotenhan family has its roots in three von Langheim brothers, who were the co-founders of Langheim Abbey in 1132. Later the name \\"de Rotha(ha)\\" was used. In 1229, reference is made to a Winther and Wolfram \\"de Rotenhagen\\" in connexion with an allodial holding of the family rather than a fief. The doorway to the staircase entrance belongs to the late Romanesque-early Gothic period. In 1323 the castle was besieged by the Bishop of W√ºrzburg, Wolfram Wolfskeel von Grumbach, for a year under the pretext of that the family had been involved in counterfeiting and a breach of feudal loyalty.

The album features performances by Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, Joe Newman, Phil Woods, Joe Henderson, Jim Hall, Ron Carter, and Jack DeJohnette. Although Jimmy Smith is credited with playing organ on the album some sources claim it was Paul Griffin that was present at the recording sessions. The liner notes to a 2000s CD release indicate that Hancock first recorded his score in London with British musicians, but rejected the results and re-recorded the music in New York with American jazz musicians.Liner notes to Blow-Up According to a Library of Congress listing, in addition to Hancock on piano, the New York sessions involved Hubbard and Newman on trumpet, Woods on alto sax, Henderson and Don Rendell on tenor sax, Griffin and Gordon Beck on organ, Hall on guitar, Carter on acoustic bass, and DeJohnette on drums. London sessions are said to have involved Hancock, Rendell and Beck, along with Ian Carr on trumpet, Pete McGurk on acoustic bass, and Chris Karan on drums. Hancock is also listed as being the arranger and music director. The album also includes \\"Stroll On\\", a rewrite of Tiny Bradshaw's \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\", by the Yardbirds featuring Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. A mono mix of this album (MGM E4447ST) features slightly longer versions of several songs.

There was a sanctuary of Artemis Laphria on the acropolis of Patras. The sanctuary had an image of Artemis Laphria, that was brought there from Calydon in Aetolia after it was laid waste by Augustus. Every year, the people held a \\"festival of the Laphria\\" in the goddess's honour \\"which was peculiar to their place\\". They made a barrier of tall logs round the altar, \\"still green\\", so that the stockade would not burn. They piled the driest wood on the altar, for kindling, and then smoothed the approaches to the pyre by laying earth on the altar steps. On the first day, the people walked in procession of the \\"greatest grandeur\\" for the goddess. A virgin priestess brought up the rear, riding in a chariot which was drawn by tame yoked deer. The next day, living animals are sacrificed, including edible birds, boars, deer, gazelles, wolves and bears, but also fruit from trees. The altar was set on fire. Animals forced out by the first leap of the flames, or escaping at full tilt were thrown back into the fire, to their death, by those who had brought them.

The son of a Swabian priest, studied in Adelberg and after school visited the lower Konvikts in Maulbronn at the T√ºbinger Stift, where he met Johann Valentin Andreae. Meiderlin was a student of Mathias Haffenreffer and 1601 obtained a master's degree.

In 1626 he published under the pseudonym Rupertus Meldenius a work entitled Paraenesis votiva per Pace Ecclesia ad Theologos Augustana Confessionis auctore Ruperto Meldenio Theologo (A Reminder for Peace at the Church of the Augsburg Confession of Theologians), in which he argued for peace among the contending parties and unity within the meaning of the Concord, and called for the practice of charity (i.e. Christian love), saying: :Verbo dicam: si nos servaremus in necessariis unitatem, in non necessariis libertatem, in utrisque caritatem, optimo certe loco essent res nostrae (F.

It is named for the sparkling light it reflects during nighttime collections. The diamond darter was first described in 2008 and is only the second known member of its genus, which also includes the crystal darter, C. asprella. On July 26, 2013, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service formally designated the diamond darter as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Description Diamond darters have 11-13 spines on their dorsal fins, and 11-15 soft rays. However, their anal fins do not have any spines at all, and only 11-13 soft rays. Adults are estimated to be 3-5 in long, with the largest specimen measuring 7.7 cm, roughly 3.0 in. Diamond darters bear a strong resemblance to crystal darters, their relatives. Both fishes are translucent, and have olive-colored patterns on their bodies. Diamond darters differ in that they have a gape equal to or larger than the width of the base of their interpelvic fins, which are shaped like sickles. They also have blotches in front of the eyes that are separate from the orbital rim. The diamond darter has fewer dorsal spines and anal rays than the crystal darter. It also has fewer rows of scales on the cheek (2), and opercle (2). Distribution Charleston, West Virginia The diamond darter was described from specimens collected from the drainages of the Cumberland, Elk, Green, and Muskingum Rivers, which are all part of the Ohio River basin, from 1980 to 2005. Because of river alterations, and problems with water quality, the diamond darter's range has become greatly diminished. As of 2008, the fish is only known to still live in the Elk River, West Virginia. The effect of the 2014 Elk River chemical spill to the diamond darter is still unknown.

Fictional character biography When the Runaways return to Los Angeles, Nico Minoru asks Chase Stein to find a job. When they head to a shopping mall, Chase tries to bag a radio station job with Val Rhymin, his idol. Meanwhile, Val argues with his manager, saying his manager doesn't let him have any freedom. Curiously, it is now when Val's boss has his seizure, and falls over the mall balcony to the floor below. Before he hits, Klara Prast saves him by making the mall plant life break his fall. In Rock Zombies Val works with Monk Theppie - treasurer of the California Witchcraft Community - to mix magic spell chanting into a new song. After testing the song on an employee - Lydia - Val broadcasts the song on the radio, transforming everyone who had plastic surgery in L.A. into zombies. Val then orders the zombies to pillage the city and meet back at the Hollywood Bowl. However the Runaways stop his plot with Nico binding Val with a spell.

Slovenia had the twenty-fourth highest level of expected human capital with 23 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. Vaccination According to a 2011 publication in CMAJ: Slovenia has one of the world's most aggressive and comprehensive vaccination programs. Its program is mandatory for nine designated diseases. Within the first three months of life, infants must be vaccinated for tuberculosis, tetanus, polio, pertussis, and Haemophilus influenza type B. Within 18 months, vaccines are required for measles, mumps and rubella, and finally, before a child starts school, the child must be vaccinated for hepatitis B. While a medical exemption request can be submitted to a committee, such an application for reasons of religion or conscience would not be acceptable. Failure to comply results in a fine and compliance rates top 95%, Kraigher says, adding that for nonmandatory vaccines, such as the one for human papilloma virus, coverage is below 50%. Mandatory vaccination against measles was introduced in 1968 and since 1978, all children receive two doses of vaccine with a compliance rate of more than 95%. For TBE, the vaccination rate in 2007 was estimated to be 12.4% of the general population in 2007. For comparison, in neighboring Austria, 87% of the population is vaccinated against TBE. Obesity It had the third highest rate of obesity in Europe in 2015. 27% of the adult population had a body mass index of 30 or more.

Athletics  Siena guard Ronald Moore dribbles toward the basket in a game against Loyola in January 2010. Siena offers 21 NCAA Division I sports, all of which participate in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC). The college generally only competed against local schools in athletics until being elevated to the Division I level in 1976. At this time, Siena became a member of the ECAC, and later the North Atlantic Conference, a forerunner to the present day America East Conference. In 1990, the college moved to the MAAC where it has remained since. Siena has not always been known by its present moniker. Athletic teams were first known as the Golden Hurricanes and later as the Indians. In March 1989, the school adopted its current nickname, the Saints. Many of Siena's athletic teams have experienced success at the Division I level. The college's most well known squad is the men's basketball team. The Saints have appeared in six NCAA Tournaments, advancing to the Round of 32 in 1989, 2008 and 2009. Siena has also played in the postseason NIT five times, capturing third place in 1994. In 2014, Siena competed in their first College Basketball Invitational tournament and won the championship defeating Stony Brook, Penn State, Illinois State and Fresno State two games to one in the best-of-three championship series. The women's basketball teams has also had a recent run of success, including a trip to the NCAA Tournament in 2001, and appearances in the 1999, 2002 and 2003 WNIT. They finished second in the 2015 WBI. Another team with recent high achievement is men's baseball. The Saints advanced to the 1999 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament and in 2005 saw pitcher John Lannan drafted by the Washington Nationals. Lannan has since become a regular starter in Washington's rotation. They also participated in the 2014 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament. Finally, the men's lacrosse team has also improved significantly in recent years. The Saints qualified for their first MAAC tournament in 2007 and their first NCAA tournament in 2009. That season, the Saints secured an automatic berth in the tournament after winning their first MAAC championship during a ten-game winning streak.Saints Face-Off with Syracuse in NCAA Tournament, Siena College, May 8, 2009.Siena College Men's Lacrosse 2009 Quick Facts (PDF), Siena College, 2009.

Released in a limited edition by CBC in early 1978, it didn't receive widespread release until later that year when GRT/Passport Records did a full release of the album that shot up the Canadian record charts fueled by the hit single \\"Phasors on Stun\\". The B-side was the instrumental song \\"Slaughter in Robot Village\\". A second single was released, \\"Journey\\", with the B-side, \\"Hours\\". It didn't sell as well, and barely charted. In 2015, Rolling Stone released its list of 50 of the Greatest Progressive Rock Albums of All Time, and Black Noise made the list at number forty eight (#48). Themes All songs with lyrics have science fiction themes. The title \\"Phasors On Stun\\" (sometimes announced as \\"Set Your Phasors On Stun\\" when performed live) is a reference to the futuristic weapons from Star Trek; the phrase does not appear in the lyrics. \\"One O'Clock Tomorrow\\" was inspired by an interview with Timothy Leary as broadcast on The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder (which came on at one o'clock a.m.), on which Leary talked about his ideas on space travel; or as explained by Hawkins in an introduction to the song during a live performance (from a radio broadcast), \\"Old Dr. Tim thought, a couple of bags of this, and a couple of bags of that, and he'd just take off into outer space\\"; but again, neither the title nor Leary are referenced in the lyrics. \\"Journey\\" and \\"Aldebaran\\" (misspelled \\"Aldeberan\\" on vinyl editions) are both about a mass exodus to another planet. \\"Dialing for Dharma\\" (an instrumental) is a pun on Dialing for Dollars, a popular live daytime television program which gave away cash prizes via telephone. \\"Hours\\" and \\"Slaughter in Robot Village\\" are also instrumentals. \\"Black Noise\\" is about mutants who live in a secret underground world beneath a city, and rise up through the sewers at night. Release history The album was originally released by CBC Records in early 1978, commissioned after the group appeared on the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) TV variety show Who's New. The group expected it would be distributed in stores like a normal release, but the CBC chose to sell it by mail order, and only announced its availability during several radio shows. The album was issued as a limited edition of 500 copies, which was sufficient to meet the response from this limited promotion.Blacknoise history page The album was given wider release in the summer of 1978 on Visa Records in the US, and on Passport Records in Canada later that year. (Passport was a sub-label of Visa, although Passport was the more prolific of the two labels.) The CBC still owned the rights to the album, and licensed it to Visa for reissue. In Canada, the Passport label was distributed by GRT Records, then by Capitol Records in 1979, and finally by A&M; Records in 1981, each distributor producing a reissue. Cameron Hawkins claims the group never received royalty payments from any of the Canadian LP editions, as their contract specified all payments were to come through Visa Records in the US, and none of the three Canadian distributors passed royalties on to Visa.Cameron Hawkins interview at Blacknoise site At the end of a performance at the Ontario Place Forum, the group were presented a gold record award for the album's sales (gold in Canada representing 50,000 sales). In 1994 Cameron Hawkins created a new record company called Now See Hear Records (initially self distributed, but later distributed by MCA Records as of 1996), and purchased the rights to Black Noise which was still owned by the CBC, but ownership was set to expire that year. Hawkins was surprised to find a competitor bidding for the rights, but his label emerged as the winning bidder. By this time, the CBC no longer possessed a master tape of the album. A search for the tape at the CBC turned up a reel tape box with an inferior cassette copy inside. Hawkins then travelled to the US to search the former Passport Records vaults for the tapes of this, and the other Passport albums, without success. Ultimately, the Now See Hear reissue of Black Noise was made from a transfer from vinyl. Now See Hear also licensed the recording to One Way Records, a company specializing in reissues, who released an American edition. The original CBC album has black and white cover art of a manhole cover, unique to that edition. All others have an alternative cover by Paul Till. The first single from the album, \\"Phasors on Stun\\" / \\"Dialing for Dharma\\", was issued on Passport in 1978. A second single, \\"Journey\\" / \\"Hours\\", was issued by Passport in 1978 as a follow-up single. =List of editions= *CBC Records LM-455 (Canada LP), 1978 *Visa Records VISA-7007 (US LP), 1978 *Passport Records 9167-9831, distributed by GRT Records (Canada LP), 1978 (#60 Can.

Norman (born 1949), is an American writer and educator. Most of his short stories and novels are set in Canada's Maritime Provinces. He has written several translations of Algonquin, Cree, and Inuit folklore. His books have been translated into 12 languages. Early years Norman was born in Toledo, Ohio. His parents were Russian-Polish-Jewish; they met in a Jewish orphanage. The family moved several times and Norman attended four different elementary schools, including in Grand Rapids, Michigan. His father was absent much of the time; his mother babysat other children. He has three brothers. After dropping out of high school, Norman moved to Toronto. Working in Manitoba on a fire crew with Cree Indians, Norman became fascinated with their folkstories and culture. He spent the next sixteen years living and writing in Canada, including the Hudson Bay area and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. During this time, he received his high school equivalency diploma, and studied later at Western Michigan University Honors College where he received Bachelor of Arts degrees in zoology and English in 1972. In 1974, he earned a Master of Arts degree from the Folklore Institute of Indiana University linguistics and folklore; his Masters thesis was entitled, Fatal Incidents of Unrequited Love in Folktales Around the World. For the next three years, he participated in the Michigan Society of Fellows; The Cree personal name was published in 1977. Career ;Writer Norman has been a prolific writer in a variety of styles. How Glooskap Outwits the Ice Giants, The owl- scatterer, and Between heaven and earth are written for juvenile audiences. His books on Canadian folklore include The wishing bone cycle (Cree), Who met the ice lynx (Cree), Who-Paddled-Backward-With-Trout (Cree), The girl who dreamed only geese (Inuit) Trickster and the fainting birds (Algonquin), and Northern tales (Eskimo). Northern Tales, translated into Italian and Japanese, was Norman's first book translated into foreign language. In Fond Remembrance of Me is not only an English translation of Noah and the Ark stories as told by a Manitoba Inuit elder, it is also a memoir of the friendship that Norman kindles with Helen Tanizaki, a writer who is translating these same stories into Japanese before her death. Norman describes The Bird Artist, a novel, as his most conservative book structurally, though not psychologically. Time magazine named The Bird Artist one of its Best Five Books for 1994. It also was awarded the New England Booksellers Association Prize in Fiction, and Norman received a Lannan Literary Award for this book. The Bird Artist and The Northern Lights were finalists for the National Book Award. The Northern Lights was completed with assistance from the Whiting Award. He received the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets for The Wishing Bone Cycle. In On the trail of a ghost, an article published by National Geographic, Norman writes about Japan‚Äôs haiku master, Matsuo Bash≈ç's 1200-mile walk in 1689, and the journey's epic log, entitled Oku no Hosomichi. His book, My Famous Evening: Nova Scotia Sojourns, Diaries & Preoccupations was published under National Geographic's \\"Directions\\" travel series. It includes a chapter on the Nova Scotia poet Elizabeth Bishop. There are also several early books published in small numbers. These include: The Woe Shirt, Arrives Without Dogs, and Bay of Fundy Journal, amongst others. ;Teacher In 1999, Norman taught at Middlebury College in Vermont. Norman became Goucher College's Writer in Residence in 2003. In 2006, he was appointed a Marsh professor at University of Vermont. Norman now teaches creative writing in the Masters of Fine Arts program at the University of Maryland, College Park. ;Professional affiliations Norman has contributed to book review periodicals (The New York Times Book Review; Los Angeles Times Book Review; National Geographic Traveler), participated on literary journals' editorial staff (Conjunctions: Ploughshares), and been a member of the board of directors for PEN New York and PEN/Faulkner group, Washington, D.C. Personal life Norman met poet Jane Shore in 1981, and they married in 1984. They have a daughter, Emma. Norman and Shore lived in Cambridge, New Jersey, Oahu, and Vermont, before settling into homes in Chevy Chase, Maryland near Washington, D.C. during the school year, and East Calais, Vermont in the summertime. Their friend, the author David Mamet, Shore's Goddard College classmate, lives nearby. During the summer of 2003, poet Reetika Vazirani was housesitting the Norman's Chevy Chase home. There, on July 16, she killed her young son before committing suicide. Some of his papers, for the period of 1975-1979, are stored at the University of Texas in the Special Collections Library.

Scholarly criticism of Norman's Cree transcriptions In 1989 the American Indian language scholar John D. Nichols published an article in International Journal of American Linguistics titled \\"The Wishing Bone Cycle\\": a Cree \\"Ossian\\"? In this article he argued that Norman's supposed Cree transcriptions were faked and consisted of words copied out of a dictionary and used improperly. Also in 1989, in the same issue of International Journal of American Linguistics, the American Indian language scholar Robert Brightman published an article titled \\"Tricksters and Ethnopoetics\\" in which he argued that the trickster cycle which appears in \\"The Wishing Bone Cycle\\" was originally recorded by the American linguist Leonard Bloomfield from the Cree story teller Maggie Achenam in 1925 and that Norman took Bloomfield's prose version and rewrote it in more poetic language.

The film tells the story of Ben (played by Rob Bradford), Andy (played by Blake Merriman), Mattie (played by Nick Vergara), and Nickie (played by Michael Pennacchio) recent highschool graduates who go to Ocean City, Maryland for Senior Week or Beach Week.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2008/05/22/AR2008052202615.html Plot The film explores the life of 18-year-old Ben, shortly after earning his degree from an unnamed high school in Maryland. Ben is heading to Senior Week to hang out with friends, party, and chase the hottest girl in high school, Annie (played by Stephanie Lynn). The movie begins outside a liquor store in Columbia, located between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. in Howard County. Ben is talking to himself when Ben's older brother's friend Brian (played by Brian Seibert) overhears him, which embarrasses Ben. Ben's older brother Josh (played by Josh Davis) gets in the car and hands Ben a bag of liquor. They then drive to pick up Ben's three friends, Andy, Mattie and Nickie. After picking up Ben's three friends, the group heads off to Ocean City. During the trip to Ocean City the group has discussions about sex, which highlights the group's limited understanding of sex and their naivete. Upon arriving in Ocean City the group gets drunk and goes to a party. After entering the party, Josh tells the boys \\"the secret\\" about female body language. Later at the party Ben talks to Megs (played by Laurel Reese), his best friend who earlier gave him that secret. As they talk, Annie enters the party. Her entrance completely distracts Ben. Ben then sits down next to Annie and flirts with her. As Ben and Annie begin to kiss, Nickie gets into a fight, which causes Annie to leave and ends the party. The next day, the group goes out on the town, has fun at the beach, and cruises the boardwalk. They end up back at Ben's condo and play Asshole. Andy becomes president and declares that Nickie must toast him. After a brief verbal spat, Ben becomes Vice President and calls for a confession. After a descriptive story from Josh about losing his virginity, the boys stumble into an awkward conversation about divorce. Throughout the rest of the week the viewer meets many more characters that come in and out of the story line.

Originally developed at Itek on the PDP-1 as EDM (Electronic Drafting Machine), the efforts were purchased by Control Data Corporation and ported to their machines, along with a new graphics terminal to support it. Systems cost almost $500,000 and supported only a few users at a time, so in spite of a number of advantages it was not cost competitive with traditional manual methods and only a few systems were sold. History =Genesis at Itek= MIT's Lincoln Laboratory developed the first high-speed computer in the form of Whirlwind, as part of the US Air Force's SAGE project. SAGE not only required high-speed computers, but also graphical displays and light pens to operate them in real-time. The ideas developed during the SAGE program \\"leaked out\\" into the industry as SAGE wound down and its many members moved on to other projects. Ken Olsen formed Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and took many of the early SAGE programmers with them, Jack Gilmore and Charles Adams started Charles W. Adams Associates, one of the first programming companies, and Norm Taylor went to work at Itek, who was attempting to build a computerized machine for retrieving photographs from a large library. In 1959 Gilmore at Adams met with Taylor at Itek and proposed the idea of jointly developing a computer system for engineering design. Taylor convinced Itek's management to fund development, finally receiving the go-ahead in August 1960, retaining Adams Associates to write the softwareFirst, pg. 2 The natural choice for the host computer was DEC's newly released PDP-1. The PDP-1 had many of the same features as the earlier Lincoln Lab machines, including an optional vector display and light pen support. The PDP-1 was based on an 18-bit word (1/2 the common mainframe 36-bits), had a 4,000-word core memory, and ran at about 0.1 MIPS. Between mid-1960 and June 1961, the basic hardware was assembled, initially at Digital‚Äôs facility in Maynard, and later at Itek. Itek's PDP-1 was the second one to be delivered to a customer,First, pg. 2 the first being to MIT's Project MAC. A new 25 inch tube was used, larger than the PDP-1's standard 16 inch Type 30, but packaged in a similar hexagonal case. Input was via a combination of light pen for pointing, and the PDP-1's front panel switches for commands. An overlay was used on the front panel to indicate the special functions, and another on the display for labeling outputs.First, pg. 5 Normally the PDP-1 display was driven in software, so as the complexity of the drawings increased, performance decreased. Itek addressed this problem by developing a \\"display processor\\" that would offload the task of refreshing the screen so the computer could be used solely for processing.Vector information was stored on the outer tracks of a 36 inch hard disk supplied by Telex. Storing data only on the outside meant the linear speed was higher, providing faster throughput and allowing the system to generate 30 images a second from the data. Vectors were stored with 4-bit points to increase performance.First, pg. 2 In total, the disk system stored about 500,000 18-bit words, with about 20,000 bytes of vector data being used. =On the market= The basic system was assembled and operational by early 1962, when Itek started actively marketing it as EDM. The system developed intense interest, and was even featured in a Time Magazine article: > The operator's designs pass through the console into an inexpensive > computer, which solves the problems and stores the answers in its memory > banks in both digitalized form and on microfilm. By simply pressing buttons > and sketching with the light pen, the engineer may enter into a running > dialogue with an EDM, recall any of his earlier drawings to the screen in a > millisecond and alter its lines and curves at will.\\"Beating the Language > Barrier\\", Time, 2 March 1962, pp. 74-75 The US Air Force purchased one system for use at the Lincoln Labs on the PDP-1 that drove their Experimental Dynamic Processor, or DX-1. This version used a magnetic drum in place of the disk, its increased performance allowing more data to be stored before performance became an issue. This version used 6-bit words for locations instead of the prototype's 4-bit words, increasing resolution and allowing support for 2,000 inch documents instead of 800.First, pg. 8 EDM was not the only CAD system being developed at the time. General Motors started developing a similar system in 1959, and IBM joined the effort in 1960. In spite of starting at about the same time, Digigraphics beat their DAC-1 to market by the better part of a year.\\"Timeline of Computer History, 1963\\", Computer History Museum =Sale to Control Data= EDM was pitched to Itek while its president Richard Leghorn was in the midst of a buying spree. The company was publicly involved in the computer industry (its name was phonetically shortened from \\"information technology\\") but in reality supplied a single product, the cameras for the CIA's CORONA spy satellites. As a number of the company's acquisitions failed, Leghorn was removed from control of the company in May 1962 and replaced by Franklin Lindsay.\\"Itek Refocused\\", Time, 8 November 1963 Lindsay quickly shed most of Leghorn's acquisitions, including EDM. The system was picked up by Control Data Corporation (CDC), who were in the process of introducing a number of computer systems. Adams Associates won a contract to port the system to the CDC 3200 while CDC created a new version of the terminal, the CDC 274, controlled by the new CDC 1700 computer. Versions of the basic system were later ported to other CDC computers, including the 6000 family, which could support several 274's on a single machine.274, pg. 1-3 Over the next few years CDC sold a small number of the Digigraphics systems, first to aerospace companies including Lockheed and Martin Marietta, and later to the US Navy, for use in submarine design.

The adaptation was first transmitted in the UK between 1975 and 1977. The production covered all seven novels (of the eventual twelve), which Graham had written up to this time. Outline The romantic saga follows Ross Poldark (Robin Ellis) as he loses his fianc√©e, the well-bred beauty, Elizabeth (Jill Townsend), to his cousin Francis (Clive Francis). Ross ends up marrying his servant, Demelza Carne (Angharad Rees), but his passion for Elizabeth simmers on for years. Set in late 18th century Cornwall, the plot follows Ross Poldark's attempts to make his derelict tin mines a success. Life is hard, smuggling is rife and Ross Poldark finds himself taking the side of the underclass against the ruthless behaviour of his enemies, the greedy Warleggan clan including George Warleggan (Ralph Bates). Although the emphasis is primarily on Ross and Demelza, there are many other characters with their own stories. In the first series we encounter Dr. Dwight Enys (Richard Morant in the first series, Michael Cadman in the second series), a young man with progressive ideas who prefers to serve the poor communities rather than the rich. Enys has a brief affair with a married actress, Keren Daniel (Sheila White), which results in her murder by her husband. By the end of the first series, Dwight has become involved with heiress Caroline Penvenen (Judy Geeson). In the second series, they marry following Ross's rescue of Dwight from a French prison. In the second series we get to see much of Geoffrey Charles Poldark (Stefan Gates), the son of Elizabeth and Francis Poldark. Francis drowns in a subterranean lake while investigating a putative new lode of copper in a mine in which he is invested with Ross. Elizabeth eventually marries Ross's great enemy George Warleggan. Geoffrey Charles resembles his father, and at times comes into conflict with his new stepfather George Warleggan, though Warleggan shows him certain kindnesses and pays for his education. Geoffrey Charles begins a friendship with Demelza's brother Drake Carne (Kevin McNally), whom he and his governess, Elizabeth's cousin Morwenna (Jane Wymark), meet in the woods on the Warleggan estate. Geoffrey Charles plays an instrumental role in the development of Drake and Morwenna's romance. Drake is Ross Poldark's brother-in-law and has a working-class background: therefore George considers him an unsuitable marriage partner for Morwenna. George marries Morwenna off to Reverend Osborne Whitworth (Christopher Biggins), whom she despises. Pining for Morwenna, Drake puts his energies into building his blacksmith business and helping his brother Sam (David Delve), a devout Methodist. Morwenna and Osborne have a son, John Conan, whom Morwenna cannot bring herself to love. Eventually Morwenna tells Osborne she will kill his son if he forces his attentions on her one more time. Osborne has an affair with Morwenna's younger sister Rowella (Julie Dawn Cole). Rowella's husband Arthur Solway (Stephen Reynolds) discovers his wife's adultery and attacks Osborne, who is dragged to death by his frightened horse. Despite being traumatized by her marriage to Osborne, Morwenna eventually marries Drake. Sam becomes enamoured of Emma Tregirls (Trudie Styler), who refuses to marry him because she knows that his Methodist congregation will never approve of her. She loves Sam, but knows that her lack of religion and her bad reputation will eventually cause conflict between him and his faith. However, the emphasis remains with Ross and Demelza, and the series concludes with the death of Elizabeth Warleggan after the birth of her and George's daughter Ursula. Elizabeth takes a potion to bring on labour early so Warleggan will be led to think that she habitually delivers her children a few weeks pre-term; Elizabeth had delivered Valentine, born eight months after her wedding to George, after she took a supposed accidental fall on the stairs, which, it is implied only, was intentional on her part because she felt the labour coming on. Valentine is Ross's son, conceived a month before Elizabeth and George's wedding, but George is long deceived as to Valentine's parentage. Agatha Poldark (Eileen Way) and Prudie Paynter (Mary Wimbush), Ross and Demelza's housekeeper, both realize that Valentine is Ross's son, and Agatha tells George of her conclusion just before her death, which occurs under George's abuse of her in his anger over her revelation. Elizabeth dies of gangrene due to the potion. When the doctor asks her if she has taken anything to bring on the labour, she denies it because Warleggan is sitting beside her. George later reveals his knowledge of what Elizabeth has done when he says to Ross, \\"See what you and I have brought her to.\\" Broadcast and legacy The BBC adaptation of the first four books of the Poldark novels was broadcast by the BBC during 1975 and 1976.Robin Ellis Making Poldark, Crossaction, 1987 This included eight weeks' location filming in Cornwall. The second series was broadcast in the UK in the autumn of 1977, from the next three books. The series in total ran to 29 episodes. Poldark is one of the most successful British television adaptations of all time.Poldark, Museum of Broadcast Communications Poldark series have since been sold in over forty countries. They are particularly popular in the United States, Spain, Italy, Greece and Israel.Obituary: Winston Graham, Daily Telegraph, 11 July 2003 On video, Poldark outsold every costume drama except for the 1995 Pride and Prejudice adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. The two series were shown to American audiences in 1977-78, as part of Masterpiece Theatre on the Public Broadcasting System. In 2007, a PBS viewer poll ranked it seventh in best- loved series from the last 35 years. A version of the eighth Poldark novel The Stranger from the Sea was made by HTV for the ITV network in 1996, but was not continued. In 2008 the BBC made a half-hour programme entitled \\"The Making of Poldark\\" as part of its series called The Cult of Sunday Night. Many of the original cast were interviewed, including Robin Ellis, Angharad Rees, Jill Townsend and Richard Morant. The series was referenced by Reeves and Mortimer, presenting Poldark on Mopeds as a rejected comedy programme in an advert for TV Licensing.TV Licensing Advert BBC, Mid-90s In February 2014, the BBC announced a new adaptation of the series, also called Poldark, to be broadcast in 2015. The series, starring Aidan Turner as Ross Poldark and Eleanor Tomlinson as Demelza, began transmission on Saturday, 7 March 2015, on the BBC's flagship channel, BBC1. Robin Ellis was cast in a small recurring role as Reverend Dr Halse.

This episode first aired in the United States on January 25, 2009. The episode was directed by James Bobin and written by Duncan Sarkies. In this episode, Bret and Jemaine's fortunes unravel after Bret buys a new teacup. With emergency band funds unavailable, Jemaine takes desperate measures in hopes of supplementing their income. \\"The New Cup\\" received largely positive reviews from critics, with many noting that both the episode's plot and songs were particularly strong. According to Nielsen Media Research, on its initial broadcast, \\"The New Cup\\" was watched by over 500,000 people. Two songs from the episode, \\"Sugalumps\\" and \\"You Don't Have to be a Prostitute\\", received positive critical acclaim and were later included on the band's second album I Told You I Was Freaky. Plot Bret buys a new cup for $2.79 so that he and Jemaine no longer have to share one cup. A month later, they find out that their check for the phone bill bounced because their account was short $2.79. The phone company charges them a $30 overdraft fee, causing the cheque for their gas bill to bounce, and both services are scheduled to be cut off. Immediately after finding this out, their power goes off. Bret ends up selling his guitar to pay the bills, and he performs on stage with Jemaine while playing air guitar and making guitar sounds. Murray writes up his negative opinion of the show in the New Zealand consulate newsletter, giving them \\"two stars out of 100\\". When Bret asks Murray for some of the emergency band fund, Murray tells him that he invested the money with a Nigerian man named Nigel Seladu who contacted him over the internet. Nigel promised Murray his money back with \\"a thousand percent interest\\" and \\"a share of his family fortunes\\". Jemaine and Bret are certain that this is merely a scam. Later on, Bret and Jemaine are confronted by Mel. When she learns they're having money troubles, she offers to pay them for a massage. Both Bret and Jemaine awkwardly try to give her a minimal contact massage while her husband, Doug, is nearby watching. Jemaine later suggests to Bret that they become male prostitutes, similar to the film Pretty Woman. They then launch into a parody of \\"My Humps\\" by The Black Eyed Peas called \\"Sugalumps\\". Trying their idea out, Jemaine approaches women on the street and asks them if they want to pay money to have sex with Bret, who is standing across the street. They then switch roles, but are unable to drum up any business. At night, their apartment is still without power and Jemaine ends up selling his bass guitar. This results in them playing a gig with both members on air guitar performing \\"Robots\\". Jemaine, meanwhile, calls up an old girlfriend and leaves a message on her answering machine asking her if she wants to pay him for the sex they previously had during their relationship. He later ends up meeting his landlord, Eugene, who found his posting for a male prostitute service on the apartment's bulletin board. Eugene advises him to go to a fancy hotel and try his luck. At a band meeting, Murray introduces Nigel Seladu, whose investment offer has turned out to be legitimate and not a scam, and results in Murray earning more than enough money for the Conchords to pay their bills and buy back their guitars. Jemaine is noticeably absent and Bret tells Murray that he is out trying to prostitute himself. Both Murray and Nigel tell Bret to go and stop him. On his way, Bret sings a song called \\"You Don't Have to be A Prostitute\\", similar to The Police's \\"Roxanne\\". He finds Jemaine in a hotel room about to have sex with a \\"pretty woman\\". He starts telling Jemaine that he doesn't need to do this any more but is interrupted by a knock on the door. Bret explains that he called the police to come and save Jemaine. When they enter, they ask Jemaine and Bret if they are prostitutes, to which Jemaine replies \\"Yes\\" and Bret replies \\"No, no. I'm just the guy that wears the big condom\\". They are both put in jail. Murray comes to bail them out, telling them that he had to spend all of their newly acquired investment return on bail. In the closing scene, a desk-fan knocks over the new cup, causing it to smash on the floor. Production The episode features the song \\"Sugalumps,\\" which serves as a parody of The Black Eyed Peas hit single \\"My Humps\\" (Fergie shown) \\"The New Cup\\" was written by writer Duncan Sarkies, his second writing credit for the series after season one's \\"New Fans.\\" The episode was directed by series co- creator James Bobin. The episode makes several noticeable references to the film Midnight Cowboy. In the scene wherein Jemaine and Bret ask women if they want to pay money to have sex with them, Bret quotes Enrico \\"Ratso\\" Rizzo's (Dustin Hoffman) line \\"I'm walking here, I'm walking.\\" Earlier in the episode, Jemaine suggested that Bret should wear a cowboy hat to be more attractive to women. In the video for \\"You Don't Have to be A Prostitute\\", Jemaine wears a leather cowboy waistcoat and cowboy shows, and wears a cowboy hat during the credits. Further cultural references are made throughout the episode. During the band meeting scene, Murray asks the duo if they can think of \\"any successful musicians with no instruments?\\" Jemaine names off The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Boyz II Men, Bobby McFerrin and Luciano Pavarotti before Murray tells them that \\"there are none.\\" While deliberating whether to become prostitutes, Bret and Jemaine reference Pretty Woman, erroneously believing Richard Gere portrayed a male prostitute in the film. Near the end of the episode, Murray tells Bret and Jemain about a Nigerian man who is seeking money via email. This is a play on the actual Advance-fee fraud that swept the internet in the latter part of the 20th century. =Songs= The first song featured in the episode is \\"Sugalumps.\\" This song is a parody of The Black Eyed Peas' hit \\"My Humps\\" which The Yale Herald wrote was based around the premise that \\"balls are significantly more hilarious than boobs\\". In addition, the song was later described as a \\"New Zealanders version of\\" Kelis's \\"Milkshake.\\" Bret briefly appears as The Prince of Parties, a reference to a song from the season one episode \\"New Fans.\\" Dave sings his portion of the rap in a style very similar to the opening theme of the TV series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The second song featured in the episode is \\"You Don't Have to Be a Prostitute.\\" In an interview with The A.V. Club, Jemaine explained that the song was inspired by The Police's hit single \\"Roxanne\\". However, the duo wished to make a \\"judgmental\\" version that \\"makes a lot of assumptions about the profession. Singing a song about prostitution, like 'I'll stop you from being a prostitute with this song'\\". Broadcast and reception \\"The New Cup\\" debuted on HBO on January 25, 2009. The episode received over 500,000 viewers. This made the episode the third highest rated premium cable episode on Sunday, coming in after an episode of United States of Tara and ranking before an episode of The L Word. Critical reception to the episode was largely positive. The A.V. Club reviewer Genevieve Koski awarded the episode an A- rating and, while noting that the episode was a \\"rehash\\" of the season one episode \\"Bret Gives Up the Dream, wrote, \\"after getting off to a somewhat shaky start with last week‚Äôs season premiere, Flight Of The Conchords seems to be settling back into its groove this week, with a couple of memorable songs to match a memorable plot.\\" IGN reviewer Matt Fowler gave it an 8.4 out of 10 rating and noted that Flight of the Conchords is at its best when \\"the antics remain tightly between [Bret and Jemaine], and this episode sticks with that,\\" noting that the episode \\"winds up being rather great.\\" Noted television critic Alan Sepinwall wrote, \\"Taken on its own, though, this [episode] was perfection, as both comedy and as musical.\\" Furthermore, he called the episode \\"magnificently constructed\\". Many reviews complimented the episode's songs. Huffington Post reviewer Mike Moody noted that both the dry humor in the episode and its songs were humorous, writing, \\"I usually find myself heading to the kitchen when the songs come on  but I usually glance back at the TV to see if Jemaine is making a funny face ‚Äì and I rush back to the couch once the last note drops. But I can't wait to download tonight's Police-inspired ['You Don't Have to be a Prostitute'] jam.\\" The Guardian named \\"Sugalumps\\" one of the top five best season two Flight of the Conchords songs.

E. polecki is found primarily in pigs and monkeys and is largely considered non-pathogenic in humans, although there have been some reports regarding symptomatic infections of humans. Prevalence is concentrated in New Guinea, with distribution also recorded in areas of southeast Asia, France, and the United States.  Morphology  Mature trophozoites of E. polecki are generally 10-20 Œºm in diameter. Trophozoites are irregularly shaped and possess pseudopodia for motility. They have a single nucleus with a small central karyosome and finely dispersed peripheral chromatin, similar to that of Entamoeba histolytica. Cytoplasmic contents are similar to other Entamoeba sp. and are usually granular and vacuolated. Cysts of E. polecki are morphologically unique, containing only one nucleus, varyingly sized chromatoid bars, and a large inclusion mass. Life cycle of Entamoeba sp.  Transmission & Life Cycle  There are two stages in the life cycle of E. polecki. The first is as a trophozoite, a vegetative stage that cannot survive in the environment. The second is a cyst, where transmission of parasite is possible and provides protection to harsh external environments. Cysts are infective when ingested by another organism. The cystic form of this protozoan has a diameter as small as 9.5 ¬µm and as large as 17.5 ¬µm. Morphologically, E. polecki is extremely similar to Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba hartmanni. Transmission follows a fecal-oral route. Infected feces with mature cysts are ingested where the cyst matures to the trophozoite in the gastrointestinal tract of the host. It is considered to be a zoonotic parasite, as close contact with infected swine have been reported to be the cause of E. polecki infections in humans. Transmission to humans from consumption of pork is unlikely. Recent studies suggest that different subspecies infect non-human primates and pigs, and close inhabitation between the two do not coincide with transmission.  Pathology  E. polecki is considered to be non-pathogenic in humans. Nonspecific symptoms from infection have been reported, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, and fever. Prevalence of infection amongst swine may be up to 25% across the world, but tend to be asymptomatic. = Diagnosis and Treatment = Examination of stool samples for uninucleated cysts and trophozoites have been used for diagnosis. This method is not always reliable due to morphological similarities between E. polecki and other Entamoeba species. More recent diagnostic methods utilizing DNA amplification and comparison have been used to better differentiate amongst pathogenic and species such as E. histolytica and non-pathogenic species. A definitive diagnosis can be made by using electroimmunotransfer blots. Serological testing is not accurate between species of Entamoeba. Treatment of infection is similar to that of other Entamoeba infections. Anti-parasitic medications such as metronidazole and ornidazole are generally used to treat human infections. Combination therapies such as metronidazole and diloxanide furoate have been effective as well.  References  # Cook R. Entamoeba Polecki [Internet]. Web.stanford.edu. 2004 [cited 23 March 2018].

Radner equilibrium  Among Radner's various contributions, the one that bears his name, Radner equilibrium (1968), is a model of financial markets.Radner (Jan. 1968) \\"Competitive Equilibrium under Uncertainty\\", Econometrica, pp. 31-58. Chiaki Hara (2006) \\"General Equilibrium Theory: Lecture Note,\\" Kyoto University. Magill and Quinzii (2002) \\"Theory of incomplete markets. 1,\\" MIT Press. In the traditional approach if the value of an asset or a contingent claim is affordable then it can be achieved. Not so with incomplete market as the payoff has to be replicable by trading of available assets that are now part of the definition of the economy. The first consequence of such a requirement is that budget sets do not fill the available space and are typically smaller than hyperplanes. Because the dimension of vectors orthogonal to the budget set is larger than one there is no reason for the price systems supporting an equilibrium to be unique up to scaling, likewise the first order conditions no longer implies that gradient of agents are collinear at equilibrium. Both happen to fail to hold generically: the first theorem of welfare economics is hence the first victim of incompleteness. Pareto-optimality of equilibria generally does not hold.Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1985) \\"Existence, Regularity, and Constrained Suboptimality of Competitive Allocations When the Asset Market Is Incomplete.\\" In traditional complete markets any policy would be undone through trading of rational expectation agents. This is no longer the case with incomplete markets as such policy-neutralising trading is no longer necessarily possible. Various policies (tax-related,John Geanakoplos and H. M. Polemarchakis (2008) \\"Pareto improving taxes,\\" monetary,Dr√®ze, J.H. and Polemarchakis, H. (2001). \\"Monetary equilibria\\", ch. 5 in Debreu, G., Neuefeind, W. and Trockel, W. (eds.), Economics Essays. A Festschrift for Werner Hildenbrand, Berlin: Springer. etc. ) have an effect when introduced when markets are incomplete. Additionally incompleteness opens the door for a theory of financial innovation with real impact. This was not possible in the traditional complete market general equilibrium model as any contingent claim could be replicated by trading and financial innovation would have no real effect.

Bryan was the former slave of Jonathan Bryan. Andrew Bryan was born in 1737 in Goose Creek, South Carolina, to slave parents. He married a woman named Hannah. Bryan converted to Christianity through the preaching of George Liele. After Liele left Savannah for a mission to Jamaica, Bryan began to preach. He was imprisoned twice for preaching to slaves, but he continued to do so. He was also severely whipped, but was noted for enduring the suffering as Jesus Christ had done. Bryan established the church which would eventually become known as First African Baptist Church, and it grew from sixty-nine members in 1788 to about seven hundred by 1800. Origin and Family Andrew Bryan was born in 1737 in the small town of Goose Creek, South Carolina. Bryan was born on a plantation called Brampton, owned by Jonathan Bryan. Brampton was known as a productive rice plantation. His father was a man named Caesar, who was a slave along with Bryan. He was a mixture of black and white. Andrew served as a coachman and a body servant to Jonathan. Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (S.P.G.) was an organization that cared for British colonist in religious matters and to support the religious needs of indians and slaves. The S.P.G. organization influenced Bryan to become a religious leader. He had a brother by the name of Sampson Bryan. Hannah Bryan was the wife of Bryan. It was believed that he had a daughter as well.  The Beginning of Preaching  While growing up on the plantation, Brampton, Bryan came across a man by the name of George Liele. Liele was the first African American to be ordained and the first to travel out of the country. Bryan and Liele became good friends and started preaching alongside each other. In 1783, Bryan and his wife were baptized along with some other slaves. Abraham Marshall and Jesse Peters baptized 45 people that followed Bryan's teachings. Those 45 people regularly organized then became his congregation. Bryan was then ordained and became the pastor of the first baptist church of Savannah, Georgia. Sampson was the first deacon of the church. Bryan would preach along the Savannah River. Liele went away to Jamaica and Bryan took over the churches that Liele would preach at, which caused an expansion in Bryan's congregation. One of these locations was owned by a man named Edward Davis in Yamacraw. Edward Davis encouraged Bryan to build a religious place in the village of Yamacraw. The gatherings at the village of Yamacraw got so big that the white community thought it was a plot of rebellion.  Service Interruptions and Arrest  Andrew Bryan became good at preaching that a lot of people were showing up to his services in the village of Yamacraw. The white community did not like that there were a lot of African American people gathering for Bryan's services. The slave masters did not want their slaves listening to Bryan because they believed that he was plotting a rebellion. The slaves that did attend the services were harassed by whites. The slaves were punished with whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, and imprisonment. The church services were interrupted constantly by the whites. Bryan was accused of plotting of a rebellion, so he was beaten and thrown in jail. Sampson was also thrown jail along with Bryan. Jonathan Bryan and other plantation owners protested the arrest of Andrew Bryan. The case was analyzed by Justice of the Inferior Court of Chatham County and it resulted in Bryan and Samson being found innocent and released. After they were released, Bryan went back preaching at Jonathan Bryan's barn from sunrise to sunset.  Expansion and Ending  While he was preaching in the barn on the Brampton plantation, Bryan's following continued to increase. Several prominent white males supported Bryan and his preachings. In 1788 the First Baptist Church got certified and Jonathan Bryan died and left Andrew Bryan 95 pound of sterling. Bryan used 50 pounds to buy his freedom from William Bryan, Jonathan Bryan's brother. On the first of June 1790 with 27 pounds of sterling he bought property from Thomas Gibbons that became a place for a new church. William Bryan and James Whitfield bought land for Bryan and his family to live on. In 1805 the first African Baptist church, Savannah Baptist church and Newington Baptist Church became Savannah River Baptist Association, contributions from Bryan allowed this to happen. Bryan pastored for 24 years and died at the age of 92 on October 6, 1812.

Colloquies in Latin means a formal written dialogue, thus in his book Erasmus explores man's reaction to others in conversations. The Colloquies is a collection of dialogues on a wide variety of subjects. They began in the late 1490s as informal Latin exercises for Erasmus' own pupils. In about 1522 he began to perceive the possibilities this form might hold for continuing his campaign for the gradual enlightenment and reform of all Christendom. Between that date and 1533 twelve new editions appeared, each larger and more serious than the last, until eventually some fifty individual colloquies were included ranging over such varied subjects as war, travel, religion, sleep, beggars, funerals, and literature.

It extends approximately from the Idaho state line east to the North Dakota state line. Route description U.S. Route 2 in Essex, Montana US 2 is a vital northern corridor for Montana. The road has more of its mileage within Montana than in any other state. It passes through three Indian reservations, comes very close to two others, and skirts the southern border of Glacier National Park. Most of the Montana segment of US 2 runs close to the northern BNSF Railway main line, and parts of the highway show up in the Microsoft Train Simulator depiction of the Marias Pass route. US 2 passes into Montana from Troy, a small town. It is also near the lowest point in Montana, where the Kootenai River leaves the state. The first large town the highway comes to is Libby. After this it meanders south and east towards Kalispell, a city of about 20,000 residents north of Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. From there the highway passes through the southern end of Glacier National Park and follows the Middle Fork of the Flathead River. After crossing the continental divide at Marias Pass west of East Glacier, the highway exits the Rocky Mountains and begins its trek through the northern plains. Just before entering East Glacier, it crosses the boundary of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation of northern Montana. As the highway enters the Great Plains, specifically the northern High Plains, the first town it encounters is Browning, the largest settlement on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. From here to the North Dakota border, the area surrounding to the highway is known as \\"The Hi-Line\\" to Montanans from the early Great Northern Railway route. The Hi-Line (also spelled Highline and Hiline) is one of around 50 folk regions in Montana. It next travels through Cut Bank and Shelby, where it meets Interstate 15 and becomes the northern border of the area known as the \\"Golden Triangle,\\" another folk region, in Montana. This area is one of the most agriculturally productive in the country. From Shelby it hits a string of small towns before it goes on to Havre, near the geographical center of the road in the state and the other northern apex of the Golden Triangle. Just south of Havre and off the highway about fifteen miles (24 km) is the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation. The highway continues east to Malta, before which it travels through the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation and parallels the Milk River. From Malta, the highway continues on to Glasgow, just north of Fort Peck Dam, and then into the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. The highway stays within the reservation for much of its remaining length through Montana, and parallels the Missouri River east of the dam. On the reservation it travels through Wolf Point and Poplar, and then exits the reservation a short distance before leaving the state. The final town of Bainville is the last major town on the highway as it leaves the state, near the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers. History The route has remained mostly unchanged from its original routing, except to expand lanes or straighten and widen some narrow sections. The most notable reroutings from the original corridor are: 1) the section from Moyie Springs, Idaho to just inside the Montana border, which once ran much further north, as seen on the 1937 map of the area (Old US 2 N. intersects today's US 2 about east of the state line); 2) passing north of Kila; 3) a route swap with S-206 between Evergreen and Columbia Falls in 1983 (as seen in the 1985 state map); 4) widening the highway to three or four lanes between Hungry Horse and West Glacier in 1987 (as seen on page 35 of the 2013 road log); and 5) construction of a more direct route between East Glacier and Browning over the Two Medicine River (which eliminated the concurrency with US 89 between Kiowa and Browning). All these former segments are still in use today. The former section from East Glacier to Kiowa is MT 49. One former segment of the original 1926 corridor is maintained as a hiking trail, just east of the intersection with MT 56. At Marias Pass, the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Monument, a obelisk patterned after the Washington Monument, was built in 1931 to honor the 25th anniversary of the United States Forest Service. It originally stood right in the middle of the highway, with traffic flowing around it. In 1989, it was placed in a rest area/memorial park south of the highway, and the highway at the summit was widened to four lanes to allow slower vehicles to be passed before descending the pass.

Before becoming mayor he was an outgoing local activist in the city. He was known by Israelis and Palestinians as the pro- Jordanian \\"father figure\\" of the Gaza Strip. He is the father of artist Laila Shawwa. Early life Al-Shawwa was born in 1909 into one of Gaza City's most prominent families. He was the youngest of five sons of Sa'id al-Shawwa, a former mayor of Gaza City and the South Palestine representative to the Supreme Muslim Council, a body that oversaw Muslim community affairs during the British Mandate of Palestine.Palestinian Personalities - S Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs (PASSIA). Rashad's mother was Lebanese. Rashad received his primary and secondary education in public schools in the city. In 1934, he graduated from the American University in Cairo with a degree in politics and economics. That year he established the first sports club in Gaza called the Center for Youth Welfare. In 1935, he was assigned the post of caretaker of a Muslim shrine in Haifa, and during his residence there, he came into contact with the Syrian revolutionary Izz ad-Din al-Qassam who was leading an insurgency against British forces in Palestine.Rashad Al-Shawwa, 1972 and 1975 Gaza Municipality. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, he helped organize the smuggling of arms from Iraq and Lebanon to the Arab Liberation Army under Fawzi al-Qawuqji. He returned to Gaza during this time period. In 1950, he founded the newspaper Sha'ab al- Arabiya (\\"The Arab Nation\\"). It was the mouthpiece of the Palestinians and he presided over the editing, but it ended after an eight-month circulation. Shawwa was appointed by Egyptian president Muhammad Naguib to \\"cleanse\\" Gaza of corruption and any remnants of the monarchy of Farouk of Egypt. Role as mayor Shawwa was appointed mayor of Gaza by Israel in 1971.Rashad Al-Shawwa, 79, Ex-Palestinian Mayor New York Times. 1988-09-28. He took over responsibility for the management of the municipality and made the decision to not annex adjacent Palestinian refugee camps to the city such as al-Shati and Jabalia. He commenced the development of the economic sector in the Gaza Strip, working on major projects for the export of locally grown citrus to the Arab world, and establishing a juice factory which still exists off Salah al- Din Street. Shawwa was deposed in 1982 for failing to cooperate with Israeli military rule of the Gaza Strip, but his local influence remained strong largely because of his chairmanship of the Gaza Benevolent Society, which dispensed Jordanian funds. During the First Intifada, Shawwa publicly sympathized with the participants of the uprising, saying \\"People here have reached a point where they don't see much difference between life and death under the insulting and degrading conditions of military occupation.\\" On 28 September 1988, Shawwa died of a heart attack in his Gaza home at 79 years of age. That same year, the Rashad Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza was completed.

At age fifteen, he earned the United States military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions at the Battle of Antietam. Biography Cook enlisted in the Union Army at age fourteen in Cincinnati, Ohio, and served as a bugler in Battery B of the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment. During the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, his unit supported General John Gibbon's attack down the Hagerstown Turnpike. Immediately after unlimbering their guns, the battery came under fire from Confederate infantrymen in the West Woods. Cook helped a wounded officer to the rear and, upon returning to his unit, found that most of the cannoneers had been killed. Seeing a dead artilleryman with a full pouch of ammunition, Cook took the pouch and began servicing the cannons. He continued to work as a cannoneer throughout the attack, despite intense fire from Confederate soldiers who came within fifteen feet of the guns. The next year, Cook participated in the Battle of Gettysburg, where he carried messages across a half-mile of fire-swept terrain. During that battle, he helped destroy a damaged caisson to prevent it from falling into the hands of approaching Confederates. For his actions at Antietam, Cook was awarded the Medal of Honor several decades later, on June 30, 1894. His official Medal of Honor citation reads: > Volunteered at the age of 15 years to act as a cannoneer, and as such > volunteer served a gun under a terrific fire of the enemy.

(Waddell, 1891) Rather than be seen as a normative category, it is rather the description of a relationship between Africans in the west African coast of Calabar and their caucasian counterparts from the west that they traded with. The name, Mbakara, has been interpreted by various writers as a shortened form of the phrase Mbaka nkara in Annang and Ibibio meaning \\"divide and rule\\". Among these groups as elsewhere, westerners came to be identified with colonialism. History Mbakara was the highest grade of Abon, a masquerade representing the spirit of the dead among the Efik of the Cross River Basin of Nigeria, and was introduced by Asibong Ekondo in about the fifteenth century. Individuals who initiated in the cult could not take the title until they were deemed fully qualified and few could attained the position. Membership was not an issue since by law no European could be accosted by the Abon or Ekpe. Usage of the title soon passed into the popular discourse and carried the connotation of power, influence and authority. Slaves taken from the area took the name with them and addressed the white Europeans as Mbakara. In the Caribbean and part of the deep south of the United States where the slaves were sold, the name was anglicized and it became Bacra, Buckra and Buckaroo and referred to a white master, slave hunter or some one with authority. =doubtful accuracy= As the description was given by the white (British) researcher Waddell during the height of European colonialism, his account is possibly racially prejudiced, if not inventive in nature. The alleged association of mbakara with a negative deity, such as Abon, the spirit of death, might be an insider's joke played on the unsuspecting European outsider as well. It goes without saying that the mbakara as a putative figure of authority has not been corroborated by later reports.

She met her husband, George Willoughby, in Iowa. He was a conscientious objector during World War II and helped find homes for Japanese-Americans who had been put in camps at the outbreak of the war. From 1971 to 1987, Willoughby and her husband were central to a group of 20 houses practicing communal living in West Philadelphia, called \\"The Life Center,\\" devoted to helping the community. The Life Center was home to, and supported the activities of the Philadelphia branch of Movement for a New Society. The Willoughbys lived in a small third-floor apartment where they practiced living simply. When a Philadelphia Daily News reporter encountered them there in June 1980, they were baking their own bread. The group started the first Take Back the Night rally, an idea that became an annual anti-crime event across the country. They later lived on the Old Pine Farm Land Trust in Deptford Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey, part of the New Jersey Green Acres program. Taking on the simple life was also a way to keep any income away from the federal government. Even so, the IRS confiscated their red Volkswagen for back taxes. During the auction at the IRS headquarters in Chester in 1970, the Willoughbys and supporters served lemonade in the hallway before submitting the winning bid of $900 to buy the car back. In 2003, she and other demonstrators had their heads shaved outside the Liberty Bell in the name of peace. They intended to send the shorn hair to senators from Pennsylvania and New Jersey to express their opposition to the war. In 2004, she and other activists spent seven days in the federal detention center in Philadelphia for blocking the entrance to the Federal Building in a protest against the Iraq war. They chose jail over $250 fines. In a statement read in court, she summed up her philosophy. \\"I am approaching my 90th year‚Ä¶ I had high hopes of leaving this earth confident that the people on it knew more about nonviolence and conflict resolution.‚Ä¶ Even after 9/11 we had a window of opportunity to do just that. By working with the United Nations and the World Court we could have helped build a stronger world community, a community of fairness and justice for all, where compassion, understanding, forgiveness, imagination, sharing and courage are valued and practiced.\\" In 2006, she and other older activists, including the poet Sonia Sanchez were charged with defiant trespass for refusing to leave a Center City military recruiting station after trying to enlist to serve in Iraq. A judge dismissed the charges. They called themselves the \\"Granny Peace Brigade.\\" Willoughby died on January 15, 2009. She is survived by three daughters, Sally Willowbee, Anita and Sharon Willoughby; a son, Alan Willoughby, and three grandchildren.

In 1817 Isaac and his son William founded the Black Ball Line along with merchants Francis Thompson (who married Isaac's daughter Mary) and Benjamin Marshall. The line, which had ships sailing once a month between New York City and Liverpool, was the first regularly scheduled shipping route in the United States. Up until that time ships sailed when they pleased. The advent of the regular schedule contributed heavily to New York becoming the dominant port in the United States.'Miles: The Building of the Subways and How They Transformed New York' by Clifton Hood, The Johns Hopkins University Press (July 13, 2004) At the time, he lived at 8th Street and Third, and walked back and forth to the South Street Seaport.'Important American periodicals dating back to 1850', Harper's Magazine, published by Harper's Magazine Co., 1892 Wright speculated on cotton and ended up losing the company to Jeremiah Thompson.

The Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama began in 1997 after his first election in 1996 to a two-year term in the Illinois Senate representing Illinois' 13th Legislative District in Chicago. He was re-elected in 1998 to a four-year term and re-elected again in 2002 to another four-year term. He resigned from the Illinois Senate in 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate. He resigned from the U.S. Senate following his election in 2008 to become the 44th President of the United States in 2009. First state Senate election, 1996 =Palmer announces noncandidacy= In August 1994, Republican Cook County State's Attorney Jack O'Malley announced the indictment of first-term U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds (D-2) of South Shore and newspapers reported that while Reynolds was unopposed on the general election ballot and would be re-elected in November 1994, state Sen. Alice Palmer (D-13) of South Shore would be the front runner for Reynolds' seat in 1996‚Äîor earlier if he was convicted and a special election was held. In October 1994, 29-year-old Jesse Jackson, Jr. of South Shore was reported to have moved a few blocks into the 2nd Congressional District and to be considering running for Reynolds' seat in 1996. After re-election in November 1994 to a four-year state Senate term, state Senate minority leader Emil Jones, Jr. (D-14) of Morgan Park was reported to also be considering the possibility of running for Reynolds' seat in 1996. State Sen. Emil Jones, Jr., state Democratic central committeeman for the 2nd Congressional District, had finished second to four-term incumbent U.S. Rep Gus Savage (D-2)‚Äîbut ahead of third-place first-time candidate Mel Reynolds‚Äîin the 1988 Democratic primary. On November 21, 1994, Alice Palmer announced she was launching a campaign committee to raise funds to run for Reynolds' congressional seat in 1996, and suggested that Jesse Jackson, Jr. run for her state Senate seat in 1996 instead of running against her for Congress. On June 27, 1995, Palmer announced she was running for Congress and would be giving up her state Senate seat instead of running for re-election in 1996. The following week newspapers reported that Palmer-supporter Barack Obama of Hyde Park‚Äîwho had been announced as chairman of the $49.2 million Chicago Annenberg Challenge on June 22 and whose memoir Dreams from My Father would be published on July 18‚Äîwould announce he was running and would be a front-runner for Palmer's state Senate seat; Obama began fundraising in July, created a campaign committee on August 7 and filed its statement of organization on September 5. Before entering the race, Obama spoke to about 30 elected officials in the district. On September 11, 1995, Illinois Governor Jim Edgar set November 28 as the date for a special primary election to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Mel Reynolds following his August 1995 conviction. The timing would allow state office holders whose terms expired in January 1997, like state Rep. Monique Davis (D-27) of Beverly, to run in the November 1995 special primary election, and if unsuccessful, still have time to file nominating petitions by the December 18 deadline for the March 1996 general primary election for re-election to their current state offices. The September 13, 1995 Hyde Park Herald reported that state Sen. Palmer, whose term also expired in January 1997, \\"may have the most to lose. If unsuccessful in the congressional race, any plans she makes to reclaim her senate seat are likely to be unpopular with her progressive constituents. ... Palmer is committed to the congressional race, according to sources close to her campaign, and has no plans to try and recapture her senate seat if her bid is unsuccessful. The chances of Palmer re-filing for her senate seat are further reduced by the fact that one of her supporters, Barack Obama, is expected to announce his candidacy for her senate post next week.\\" =Obama, Askia, Ewell announce candidacies= At 6 p.m. on September 19, 1995‚Äîthe first day of the thirteen- week period in which candidates could circulate nominating petitions to earn a place on the ballot for the March 1996 primary‚Äî34-year-old Barack Obama announced his candidacy for Palmer's state Senate seat to a standing-room-only audience of 200 supporters at the Ramada Inn Lakeshore at 4900 S. Lake Shore Drive in Hyde Park-Kenwood, Chicago in the same room where thirteen years earlier Harold Washington had announced his successful run for Mayor of Chicago. Palmer introduced and endorsed Obama as her successor to supporters that included 4th Ward Ald. Toni Preckwinkle of Hyde Park, newly elected 5th Ward Ald. Barbara Holt of Hyde Park, state Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie (D-25) of Hyde Park, Cook County Clerk David Orr of Rogers Park, and many other politicians. The October 25, 1995 Hyde Park Herald reported that two other first-time candidates, Gha-is Askia and Marc Ewell, had announced the previous week that they were also running for the state Senate seat Palmer was giving up. * Gha- is F. Askia of South Shore was a 39-year-old Black Muslim assistant to W. Deen Mohammed and a close friend of Muhammad Ali (who would host a fundraiser for him in November) and had been a special assistant to Democratic Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris and was kept on as a community affairs liaison under Republican Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan after campaigning for Ryan and Republican Illinois Governor Jim Edgar in 1994. Askia had campaigned for the re-election of U.S. Sen. Alan Dixon of Belleville over Carol Moseley-Braun of South Shore in the 1992 Democratic primary, supported the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1991, and had campaigned for the re-election of Chicago city treasurer Miriam Santos of Lake View over four-term 5th Ward Ald. Larry Bloom of Hyde Park in the 1995 Democratic primary. Askia was endorsed by state Sen. Emil Jones, Jr. (D-14) of Morgan Park, state Rep. Connie Howard (D-32) of Chatham, Chicago city treasurer Miriam Santos of Lake View, and Harold Washington Party chairman David Reed of Hyde Park. * Marc Ewell of Chatham was the 30-year-old youngest son of former eight-term state Rep. Raymond W. Ewell of Chatham‚Äîa regular Democrat who had represented part of the 13th District for sixteen years (1967‚Äì1983) until losing a close Democratic primary race in 1982 to state Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie of Hyde Park, an independent Democrat, after redistricting had thrown the two incumbents into the same representative district. The Illinois Circuit Court of Cook County dismissed the suit of 17th Ward Democratic committeeman candidate Raymond W. Ewell seeking reinstatement to the ballot after the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners removed his name from the April 14, 1964 primary ballot due to insufficient valid signatures after a rival successfully challenged the legitimacy of his nominating petitions. Ewell said he had been \\"born, raised, and educated in the 13th District\\" before going to Howard University in Washington, D.C., and had become a property inspector for a private real estate firm in 1995 after three years as a staff assistant to U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun. Ewell had worked on the campaigns of his father and Carol Moseley-Braun as well as those of Cook County Board president John Stroger, the late state Sen. Charles Chew, state Rep. Charles Morrow (D-26), and 17th Ward Ald. Allan Streeter. An October 29, 1995 Sunday Chicago Sun-Times article about circulating nominating petitions‚Äîlegally required to demonstrate a candidate has enough support from registered voters to be on the ballot with signatures that can withstand challenges by rival candidates‚Äîquoted Obama's campaign manager Carol Anne Harwell on the importance of volunteers, precinct captains, and campaign aides doing the thankless but essential job of circulating nominating petitions. By late October 1995‚Äîafter five of the ten Democrats who had filed to run in the special primary election for Reynolds' vacated congressional seat had been eliminated following challenges to their nominating petitions‚Äîpolls showed Alice Palmer had dropped to a distant third behind Jesse Jackson, Jr. and state Sen. Emil Jones, Jr., which caused Palmer's fundraising to dry up in the final month of the campaign after having raised over $200,000 during the preceding twelve months. On November 7, 1995, the condition of Obama's mother Ann Dunham‚Äîwho had been diagnosed with metastatic uterine cancer and had undergone chemotherapy‚Äîacutely worsened and she was hospitalized in Honolulu and not able to respond when Obama's maternal half-sister Maya Soetoro arrived, and their mother died that night. Obama arrived in his native Honolulu the following day and said a decade later that his mother's death at the age of 52 was the worst experience of his life and cited as his biggest mistake not getting to Honolulu in time to be at her bedside when she died. Obama remained in Honolulu for his mother's private memorial service and returned to Chicago soon after. On November 28, 1995, after finishing a distant third in the 2nd Congressional District special primary election behind the winner, 30-year-old Jesse Jackson, Jr., and 60-year-old Emil Jones, Jr., and dismayed at receiving only 2,917 votes in Chicago and 3,426 votes in suburban Cook County, a disappointed 56-year-old Alice Palmer told a small gathering at a Harvey hotel that she wouldn't seek re-election to the state Senate and was undecided about entering the March 1996 primary for the 2nd Congressional District seat. =Lynch, Palmer announce candidacies= On December 4, 1995, some Palmer supporters‚Äîled by Northwestern University professor Adolph L. Reed, Jr. who had recently moved to South Shore, Northeastern Illinois University associate professor Robert T. Starks of South Shore, and 77-year-old City Colleges of Chicago professor emeritus Timuel D. Black, Jr. of Grand Crossing‚Äîbegan a draft movement to persuade her to run again for her state Senate seat after learning she was keeping a promise to back \\"a relatively unknown African-American attorney.\\" The December 8, 1995 Chicago Reader cover story was a laudatory eight-page profile of Obama that noted Palmer's endorsement of Obama and her promise not to run against him if she lost the November 28 special primary election for Reynolds' vacated congressional seat. On December 11, 1995‚Äîthe first filing day for nominating petitions‚ÄîObama filed his nominating petitions with over 3,000 signatures; perennial unsuccessful candidate Ulmer D. Lynch, Jr. also filed nominating petitions for the 13th District state Senate seat. * Ulmer D. Lynch, Jr. of Englewood was a 69-year- old former building manager, ex-city laborer, and former precinct captain in regular Democratic committeeman William Shannon's 17th Ward organization before he broke with Shannon and ran unsuccessfully against him for alderman in 1967 and subsequently regularly ran unsuccessfully for alderman and Democratic ward committeeman from the 17th Ward (and later the 16th Ward) and occasionally ran unsuccessfully for state representative. On December 18, 1995‚Äîthe last filing day for nominating petitions‚ÄîPalmer held a press conference at Harper's Banquet Hall in Woodlawn to announce she was running for re-election to the state Senate, accepting a draft by over 100 supporters including Mark S. Allen of Englewood (Jesse Jackson Jr.'s campaign strategist and his successor as Rainbow/Push Coalition national field director), journalist-activist Lu Palmer of Bronzeville, SEIU Local 73 president Tom Balanoff, state Sen. Emil Jones, Jr. (D-14) of Morgan Park, state Sen. Donne Trotter (D-15) of South Chicago, state Sen. Arthur Berman (D-9) of Edgewater, state Sen. Miguel del Valle (D-2) of Humboldt Park, state Rep. Lovana \\"Lou\\" Jones (D-5) of Douglas, and 5th Ward Ald. Barbara Holt of Hyde Park (the only local elected official reported to have switched their endorsement from Obama to Palmer). The Committee to Re-elect Alice Palmer also included: retired state Sen. Ethel Skyles Alexander, Dr. Sydney Bild, Bernice Bild, University of Chicago Assoc. Prof. Michael Dawson, UIC Prof. Cedric Herring, Frank Mason, Louis Pardo, Edna Pardo, UIC Prof. David Ranney, Olive-Harvey College Prof. Harold Rogers, Lois Anne Rosen, University of Chicago Prof. Kenneth Warren, and Betty Willhoite. Palmer then drove to Springfield to file nominating petitions with almost 1,600 signatures she said her supporters had gathered in ten days; also filing nominating petitions on the last filing day were Askia and Ewell. Palmer had originally endorsed Obama to fill her seat, but changed her mind, she said, because of the tremendous support and draft by constituents. \\"I had said I would help someone else and that is one of the reasons I was reluctant but the draft was so big,\\" Palmer stated. Obama said he was disappointed that Palmer had decided to run for re-election because it was partly based on her endorsement that he had decided to run. He said several months ago, Palmer asked him for his support of her congressional candidacy. \\"Aware of her reputation for integrity and her progressive views on the issues, I wholeheartedly agreed,\\" Obama said. \\"On Sept. 19, based on Palmer's insistence that she was not running for state senator in the event she lost as well as her enthusiastic support, I announced that I would run for the Senate,\\" Obama said. On December 20, 1995, after consulting with his supporters, Obama confirmed that he was staying in the race. \\"I've made a commitment to a great number of volunteers ... people who've gone out on cold days and circulated petitions, raised funds on my behalf and after talking to them, they feel very strongly that we're talking about the right issues. We offer a vision for the future,\\" Obama said. =Nominating petition challenges= On December 26, 1995‚Äîthe last day to file challenges‚ÄîBarack Obama supporter Ron Davis filed objections to the legitimacy of the nominating petitions of state Sen. Palmer, and to those of Askia, Ewell and Lynch; a week later hearings began to determine whether their names would be on the ballot for the March 19 primary election. The January 10, 1996 Hyde Park Herald reported that after conducting checks the previous week, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners' initial findings indicated that all four would-be opponents of Obama, including incumbent state Sen. Palmer, may not have the required number of valid nominating petition signatures. Obama was endorsed by the New Party‚Äîa small, progressive party that has since dissolved. On January 13, Obama received the endorsement of the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization (IVI-IPO). On January 17, 1996‚Äîthirty days after her surprise announcement that she was running for re-election‚ÄîPalmer announced she was withdrawing her bid for re- election because she was left with only 561 valid signatures on her nominating petitions, 196 short of the required 757 valid signatures needed to earn a place on the ballot after almost two-thirds of the 1,580 signatures on her nominating petitions were found to be invalid. The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners had previously sustained an objection to the nominating petitions of Lynch because of insufficient valid signatures, and subsequently sustained objections to the nominating petitions of Askia‚Äîwho was left with only 688 valid signatures on his nominating petitions, 69 short of the required 757 valid signatures after almost two- thirds of the 1,899 signatures on his nominating petitions were found to be invalid, and Ewell‚Äîwho was left with only 671 valid signatures on his nominating petitions, 86 short of the required 757 valid signatures after almost half of the 1,286 signatures on his nominating petitions were found to be invalid. Lynch and Ewell, in separate federal lawsuits, unsuccessfully sued the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners seeking to reverse its decision to remove their names from the ballot. =Primary and general elections= In the March 19, 1996 primary election, Obama, running unopposed on the ballot, received 16,279 votes in winning the Democratic nomination for state senator for the 13th District. The citywide turnout of 35% was a then record low for a presidential primary election in Chicago and down from 56% in 1992. In September 1996, the Hyde Park Herald reported that, according to the Illinois State Board of Elections, Obama would face two challengers on the November general election ballot: Harold Washington Party candidate David Whitehead and Republican Party candidate Rosette Caldwell Peyton. * David Whitehead of West Englewood was a 61-year-old perennial unsuccessful candidate who had been a homebuilder, real estate broker and salesman, and beginning in 1983 had run unsuccessfully five times for alderman from the 15th Ward, run unsuccessfully in the 1990 Democratic Party primary for state representative, and run unsuccessfully as a Harold Washington Party candidate for Cook County commissioner in 1994. * Rosette Caldwell Peyton of South Shore was a 67-year-old first-time candidate who had been a teacher at Kozminski Community Academy in Hyde Park. In October 1996, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times both endorsed Obama for state Senate. In the November 5, 1996 general election, Democratic Party candidate Obama was elected state senator for the 13th District with 48,592 votes (82.15%); Harold Washington Party candidate David Whitehead received 7,461 votes (12.61%); and Republican Party candidate Rosette Caldwell Peyton received 3,091 votes (5.22%). The citywide turnout of 63% was the record low for a presidential general election in Chicago and was down from 74.5% in 1992. The 1996 election was the last in Illinois to allow straight-ticket voting. On January 8, 1997, Obama was sworn in for a two-year term as state senator for the 13th District, which was then a T-shaped district that spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from 47th Street in Hyde Park-Kenwood south through South Shore to 81st Street and from the lakefront west through Chicago Lawn (on the north side of Marquette Park) to Central Park Avenue (3600 W). State Sen. District 13 = State Rep. Districts 25 & 26. Second state Senate election, 1998 In the March 17, 1998 primary election, Obama, running unopposed on the ballot, received 16,792 votes in winning the Democratic nomination for state senator for the 13th District, and Yesse B. Yehudah, also running unopposed on the ballot, received 401 votes in winning the Republican nomination. * Yesse Ben Yehudah of South Shore was the 50-year-old founder and executive director of F.O.R.U.M (Fulfilling Our Responsibilities Unto Mankind). In October 1998, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times again both endorsed Obama for state Senate. In the November 3, 1998 general election, Democratic Party candidate Obama was re-elected to a four-year term as state senator for the 13th District with 45,486 votes (89.17%); Republican Party candidate Yesse Yehudah received 5,526 (10.83%). Third state Senate election, 2002 On September 5, 2001, Democrats won a lottery that added a tie-breaking ninth member (Michael Bilandic) to the bipartisan state Legislative Redistricting Commission, which on September 25, 2001, by a 5‚Äì4 party-line vote approved the Democratic map called \\"Currie II as amended by the Bilandic Amendment\\" after its Legislative Redistricting Commission member authors, state Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie (D-25) of Hyde Park and former Chicago Mayor Bilandic. The 8-member state Legislative Redistricting Commission included former state Rep. Raymond W. Ewell (appointed by Illinois Senate Minority Leader Emil Jones, Jr.). The remap was called \\"the Currie plan\\" after its author. After redistricting, the new 13th District spanned Chicago lakefront neighborhoods from Goethe Street (1300 N) in the Gold Coast south through South Chicago to 98th Street in the Vets Park neighborhood of South Deering; with a Census 2000 total population that was 66% black (voting age population 62% black), versus a Census 2000 total population that was 77% black in the old 13th District. In the March 19, 2002 primary election, Obama, running unopposed on the ballot, received 30,938 votes in winning the Democratic nomination for state senator for the new 13th District. In the November 5, 2002 general election, Democratic Party candidate Obama, running unopposed on the ballot, was re-elected to a four-year term as state senator for the new 13th District with 48,717 votes.

During the 1984 US presidential election, publicity about DiBernardo having rented business premises from the husband of Geraldine Ferraro embroiled her in damaging media innuendo about organized crime. By some accounts, DiBernardo was the major figure behind the US adult industry. In any event, he was a relatively capable businessman who did not have any personal reputation for involvement in violence, but his Mafia links deterred potential competitors and warded off other criminals. He became immensely influential in the US pornography business, and an associate of Reuben Sturman. Whether DiBernardo's relationship with Sturman and others was based on outright extortion or mutual advantage was never established. DiBernardo was seen as a phenomenal money maker, secretive, and a lone operator (unlike most Mafia members of his status, he did not retain a 'crew' to back him up). All of these traits made him vulnerable to others within Gotti's organization. DiBernardo, who had been target of a Federal investigation into child pornography, was awaiting sentence when he was murdered by Sammy Gravano. The body was never found. According to some accounts, Angelo Ruggiero engineered an order from Gotti to kill DiBernardo simply to avoid repaying a debt to him. Biography =Rise= One of the very few thought to have become made in the Mafia without committing a murder, DiBernardo, at that time allegiant to the DeCavalcante crime family, bought the soft core business Star Distributors in the late 1960s, and used it to sell hard core of all types and media to adult industry businesses around Times Square, which had long been seen as an insalubrious if not actually dangerous district where police did not prevent flouting of obscenity and other laws. To many, the proliferation of such businesses in the early 1970s made the area a symbol of the city's decline.William J. Bratton and William Andrews, \\"What we've learned about policing,\\" City Journal, Spring 1999, available at http://www.city- journal.org/html/9_2_what_weve_learned.html (accessed Feb. 3, 2009).George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson, \\"Broken Windows,\\" The Atlantic, March 1982, available at https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/198203/broken-windows (accessed Feb. 3, 2009). By the mid-1970s, hard core child pornography was being openly sold in New York and other US cities, sparking outraged calls for the banning of all pornography and drawing police attention to DiBernardo. These films were imported, usually from Denmark or Holland; they were viewed in peep show booths.What Wild Ecstasy By John Heidenry p 323New York Magazine 2 Jun 1997 p40-41NYT 14 June 1986 POLICE HUNT REPUTED MOB OFFICER REPORTED MISSING FOR PAST WEEK DiBernardo became associated with the Gambino crime family through his acquaintanceship with fellow pornographer and Gambino capo Ettore Zappi. Zappi allegedly sponsored DiBernardo for membership in the Gambino family. DiBernardo directly commissioned the production of much of the so-called Golden Age of Porn era hardcore films made in New York; rivals were intimidated out of business or co-opted into his network. Independents such as the West-coast Mitchell brothers who were immune to pressure due to their location or other reasons had their films pirated. In his relationship with the largest US porn seller, Reuben Sturman, it is unclear whether DiBernardo was extorting or collaborating. However, FBI bugs caught DiBernardo telling another pornography magnate, Michael Thevis, that \\"the family\\" was in charge of his businesses.Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market By Eric Schlosser DiBernardo and his associate Theodore \\"Teddy\\" Rothstein ‚Äì the co-owner of KED Productions Inc. with DiBernardo ‚Äì were among 44 people indicted as a result of an undercover FBI investigation of all major publishers and distributors of adult films and magazines throughout the United States which began in 1977. DiBernardo became the prime target of the operation following the death of Michael \\"Mickey Z\\" Zaffarano, a Bonanno crime family capo who suffered a fatal heart attack as FBI agents served a warrant for his arrest at his Times Square adult movie theater on February 14, 1980.Firm Run by FBI Breaks National Smut Conspiracy Charles R. Babcock and Scott Armstrong, The Washington Post (February 15, 1980) Bernardo and Rothstein were convicted in Miami of conspiracy, transporting obscene materials for the purpose of sale and distribution, and three counts of using a common carrier to transport obscene materials across state lines on June 12, 1981 and each sentenced to five years in prison.The third trial in the FBI's 'Miporn' investigation of pornography traffic has brought the conviction of one of the probe's prime targets United Press International (June 13, 1981) A federal judge then overturned the convictions of DiBernardo and Rothstein and ordered the indictments against them dismissed on grounds that FBI agent Patrick Livingston ‚Äì who posed as a dealer of adult materials in Miami and purchased allegedly obscene films and videotapes from KED Productions ‚Äì may have lied to a grand jury. Livingston was arrested for shoplifting in November 1981, and there was evidence he was experiencing psychiatric problems involving an inability to distinguish between his real and undercover identities.Court Won‚Äôt Hear Appeal in FBI Obscenity Case James H. Rubin, Associated Press (May 5, 1986) Although ostensibly only ranking as soldier in the Gambino crime family, he reported and paid financial tribute directly to Paul Castellano. DiBernardo complained that he got little respect from Castellano, who despised the porn business, but that Castellano took a hefty percentage of the returns nonetheless. One of the first to support John Gotti's plot to kill Castellano and supplant him as boss, DiBernardo was rewarded with the status of 'captain' although he did not actually head a 'crew' of his own.The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Mafia, 2nd Edition Capeci =National attention= New York police routinely surveilled DiBernardo as an organized crime figure, but he only became widely known through his name coming up in publicity surrounding the 1984 Democratic candidate for United States vice president.Pornography and Sexual Representation: A Reference Guide (2001) Joseph W. Slade The Mondale campaign was wrong-footed shortly after choosing Geraldine Anne Ferraro for the ticket when the personal finances of Ferraro and her husband, real estate developer John Zaccaro, were made an issue and it emerged DiBernardo rented his premises from Zaccaro's company.Ferraro, My Story, pp. 156‚Äì158. p. 119. The issue removed early momentum the Mondale‚ÄìFerraro ticket had gained, and diverted the campaign. p. 966. DiBernardo was not mentioned during the 1984 vice-presidential debate, though questions over Ferraro's separate tax filing, which were widely seen as carrying implications about her husband's business, put her on the defensive. The Mondale-Ferraro ticket, always a heavy underdog, lost the general election.Germond and Witcover, Wake Us When It's Over, p. 537. In 1992, the now-deceased DiBernardo was brought-up with more effect to discredit Ferraro, seriously damaging her fortunes in a Senate primary that she had been front- runner for.NYT, August 23, 1992, Questions Facing the Front-RunnerFerraro, My Story, pp. 312, 313. =Murder= Sammy Gravano said he was told by caporegime Angelo Ruggiero that DiBernardo was being subversive and consequently, boss John Gotti wanted DiBernardo dead. Gravano later claimed to have been reluctant to carry out the order; mainly because he failed to understand how DiBernardo, without a violent reputation or the soldiers that would be necessary for any power play, could or would be posing a threat to Gotti's leadership. According to Gravano, Ruggiero insisted that DiBernardo had to be killed. On June 5, 1986, DiBernardo was lured to the basement offices of Gravano's drywall company on Stillwell Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Acting as if it were a regular business meeting, Gravano told Joseph Paruta to get DiBernardo a cup of coffee. Paruta, who was known as \\"Gravano's Personal Luca Brasi\\" got up, but instead of getting the coffee, took a .38-caliber revolver from a cabinet behind DiBernardo and shot him in the back of the head. Gravano claimed that he later learned that Ruggiero was $250,000 in debt to DiBernardo and realized Ruggiero may have fabricated the orders from Gotti or simply lied to Gotti about what DiBernardo was accused of saying in order to erase the debt and improve his own standing in the family. In any event, DiBernardo's death proved profitable for Gravano, as he took over the deceased man's control of Teamsters Local 282, leading to speculation by many, particularly Gotti, that Gravano fabricated the situation for his own profit.Maas, Peter.

It is primarily a club for men and women with intellectual interests, and particularly (but not exclusively) for those who have attained some distinction in science, engineering, literature or the arts. Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday were the first chairman and secretary and 51 Nobel Laureates have been members.official website The clubhouse is located at 107 Pall Mall at the corner of Waterloo Place. It was designed by Decimus Burton in the Neoclassical style, and built by the company of Decimus's father, James Burton, the pre-eminent London property developer. Decimus was described by architectural scholar Guy Williams as \\"the designer and prime member of the Athenaeum, one of London's grandest gentlemens' [sic] clubs\\". The clubhouse has a Doric portico, above which is a statue of the classical goddess of wisdom, Athena, from whom the club derives its name. The bas-relief frieze is a copy of the frieze of the Parthenon in Athens. The club's facilities include an extensive library, a dining room known as the coffee room, a Morning Room, a drawing room on the first floor, a restored smoking room (smoking is no longer permitted) on the upper floor, and a suite of bedrooms. Foundation The Athenaeum was founded in 1824 at the instigation of John Wilson Croker, then Secretary to the Admiralty, who was largely responsible for the organisation and early development of the club. In 1823, Croker wrote to Sir Humphry Davy, > I will take the opportunity of repeating the proposition I have made to you > about a club for literary and scientific men and followers of the fine arts. > The fashionable and military clubs... have spoiled all the coffee houses and > taverns so that the artist, or mere literary man... are in a much worse > position. Croker suggested 30 names for the club's organising committee, including the Earl of Aberdeen, the Earl of Ashburnham, Earl Spencer, Lord Palmerston, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Francis Chantrey, and Robert Smirke the Younger: all of those invited, except Richard Payne Knight, accepted. The first meeting of the Athenaeum, with 14 men present, was held at the rooms of the Royal Society on 16 February 1824. A Committee was formed, the names being proposed by Croker, who wrote that \\"all depends on having a committee with a great many good names and a few working hands\\". A smaller sub-committee was appointed with full powers to do what was necessary to establish the club. It was resolved that there should be 400 members, of whom 300 were to be appointed by the committee and the remainder elected by ballot. Sir Humphry Davy became the first chairman of the club and Michael Faraday the first secretary. Faraday soon found that he could not spare the time required and resigned, though he remained a member of the club. The total number of members was increased to 1,000 by December 1824. By May 1824 temporary premises had been rented at 12 Waterloo Place, which had been constructed by the company of club member James Burton, the pre-eminent London property developer, whose son Decimus Burton, then 24 years old, was commissioned to design a permanent clubhouse. A site was chosen on the north side of Pall Mall East but was found to be too small. The next proposed site was on the east side of Trafalgar Square, but then the government decided to demolish Carlton House and develop the site and a portion of it was offered to the Athenaeum. The offer was accepted and a long lease was granted by the Crown. The Clubhouse Decimus Burton was commissioned to design the clubhouse at 107 Pall Mall, at the corner of Waterloo Place. Despite his young age, Decimus Burton had already designed many notable buildings in London. Burton's clubhouse is in the Neoclassical style, with a Doric portico with paired columns, and has been described by architectural scholar Guy Williams as \\"a building of remarkable grace and astonishing novelty\\" with a central staircase that is \\"distinctly Egyptian in flavour\\". Burton made himself responsible for the design of as many of the decorative features of the club as possible, including the clock-cases and the pendant light-fittings. When the clubhouse was completed in April 1830, the members of the club committee stated, > [They] are bound to express their entire satisfaction at the manner in which > the work has been carried out by Mr. Burton. They can testify, and indeed > the foregoing Accounts evince, the general accuracy of his estimates and > they trust that the club at large, as well as the public, must be satisfied > of his professional skill, and the beauty of his architectural designs. The original building had two principal storeys; the third and fourth were added at the end of the 19th century.The Athenaeum Club in 1830 There is a continuous balustrade on the first floor, with an outstanding but costly frieze, designed by Decimus Burton and executed by John Henning, a leading sculptor of the day, which is a copy of the marbles from the Parthenon in Athens (\\"The Elgin Marbles\\", now in the British Museum), depicting the Panathenaic procession, copied from the Parthenon. Croker, who was much involved in the building of the clubhouse, was determined that it should have the frieze, despite the cost, and resisted pressure from some members (in those pre-refrigeration days) that an ice-house be part of the scheme; leading some wit to compose the rhyme: The frieze was executed by John Henning at a cost of ¬£1,300. Building works commenced in 1827 and were completed by 1830. The statue of Pallas Athene by Edward Hodges Baily, which stands above the porch, was installed in the same year (the spear was added later). The total cost was ¬£43,101 14s 8d. This exceeded the estimate by ¬£2,226, attributed to the cost of gas fittings and furniture. The cast of the Apollo Belvedere positioned in the recess at the top of the principal staircase at the Athenaeum was a gift to the club from Decimus Burton. A statue of Demosthenes was first installed there but was speedily removed and replaced by the Apollo. The statues of Venus and Diana on either side of the hall are casts of antique statues in the Louvre in Paris. Membership statutes The new building was complete by early 1830 and the first general meeting was held there on 30 May 1830. In the same year the rules of the club were amended by the addition of a new Rule 2, which allowed the Committee to elect each year not more than nine persons \\"of distinguished eminence in science, literature or the arts\\". This rule has always been a special feature of the club and, with the addition of the words \\"or for public service\\", remains in force today. Ordinary members were elected by ballot (until 1935). The Duke of Wellington was a founding member of the club and the stone installed at his request to assist him in mounting his horse can still be seen on the pavement outside the front porch. After the completion of the building there was a cash deficit of some ¬£20,000 and in 1832 it was decided to bring in 200 supernumerary members, half selected by the committee and half elected by the club. This restored the finances for the time being, but additional expenditure was soon required to improve the ventilation of the clubhouse and because of recurrent troubles with the gas lighting (it was one of the first buildings to be lit by gas) and it was decided in 1838 to increase the permitted number of members to 1,200, which made it necessary to elect a further 40 members. These became known as the \\"Forty Thieves\\" and comprised some very distinguished men including Charles Dickens and Charles Darwin.Humphry Ward: History of the Athenaeum 1824‚Äì1925 (1926) see chapters II to IV for the early history of the club The number of members was still 1,200 when Humphry Ward published his history of the club in 1926, but has subsequently been increased to 2,000. There was always a long waiting list in the 19th century and the earlier years of the 20th century. Later history to 1914 Originally water was obtained from a well and St Martins pump and also (unsatisfactorily) from the Chelsea Water Works. A proper public supply was connected in 1853 and in 1855 a primitive system of mains drainage was made available, although a fully efficient system did not come until 1885. In 1886 the clubhouse was first lit by electricity, supplied by its own two generators in the basement until connected to a public supply in 1896. The interior of the clubhouse was extensively redecorated in the early 1890s to designs by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Sir Edward Poynter, both members of the club. The morning room decoration (by Poynter) remains largely unchanged. An electric lift was installed in 1900, replacing an earlier hydraulic lift.. Humphry Ward pp.86-88. Waugh pp.12-19 & 30\\\\. Cowell pp.24-26. See also The Athenaeum Collection The 3rd principal storey was added to the building in 1898, after more than one earlier proposal had been rejected, largely because the members were not prepared to accept an increase in the subscription. This provided space for a large Smoking Room and other rooms including staff bedrooms. The architect was T.E.Collcutt. In 1899 the small smoking room in the basement was combined with the adjoining Billiards Room to make a larger Billiards Room with two tables.Humphry Ward pp.89-91. Cowell p.30 Early in 1914, the Committee passed a resolution allowing members to invite guests (then limited to two male guests) to dinner in the evening and in the Drawing Room afterwards. Previously, only members could eat in the club.Cowell p.118 History of the Club after 1914 Smoking had been strictly forbidden in the club, except in rooms designated for the purpose, until in 1924 it was allowed after 1.30 pm in the drawing room and in 1928 throughout the club, except in the coffee room (as the main dining room is still designated) and the south library.Cowell pp.27-8 In 1927/28 a fourth storey was built to provide bedrooms for members and the third floor, which had previously held staff bedrooms, was adapted to provide members' bedrooms. At the same time a large part of the third floor smoking room was converted into bedrooms and a washroom.Cowell pp.30-31 In 1936 the club took a lease of 6 Carlton Gardens, once Gladstone's house, as a ladies annexe with a dining room and drawing room (where members could invite female guests). This was closed during the Second World War and thereafter (although reopened) it lost its former popularity. The lease expired in 1961 and was not renewed. The Crown refused consent for a new building above the ground, and so a new ladies annexe was constructed under the garden, incorporating the former billiards room.

For several hours, Ben Gurion and Philby held informal talks there on a draft treaty between the Zionist movement and an Arab Federation headed by Ibn Saud.

The cast of the Apollo Belvedere positioned in the recess at the top of the principal staircase at the Athenaeum was a gift to the club from Decimus. There is a photographic portrait of Decimus, taken in 1873, preserved at the club, and the club retains some furniture designed by Decimus. Another early member was Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, a close friend of the Burtons. Notable members 51 members of the Club have won the Nobel Prize, including at least one in each category of the prize. References to the Club Theodore Hook in the early years of the Club (of which he was a member) commenced his light-hearted verse description of the London clubs with these lines: In 1853, Charles Manby Smith noted the importance of the club: \\"from having been wise enough to join the grocer's Plum-pudding Club, they shall end by becoming prosperous enough to join the Whittington Club, or the Gresham Club, or the Athenaeum Club, or the Travellers' Club; or the House of Commons, or the House of Lords either.\\"Smith, Charles Manby, Curiosities of London Life, or Phases, Physiological and Social of the Great Metropolis (1853) online at Victorian London - Publications - Social Investigation/Journalism - Curiosities of London Life, or Phases, Physiological and Social of the Great Metropolis, by Charles Manby Smith, 1853: UNFASHIONABLE CLUBS (accessed 14 January 2008) The hall of the club in 1841.

In both 1824 and 1828 Jackson used the song as his campaign song during his presidential campaigns.Hickey p.347Faragher p.335 Origin \\"Hunters of Kentucky\\" was originally published ca. 1815 in Boston and celebrated the courage of the Kentuckians who fought in the Battle of New Orleans. One-fourth of Jackson's men at the Battle of New Orleans were from Kentucky. The tune for the song is available on the website It was sung the way Irish singers told stories in narrative form, and performed to the tune of Ally Croker and The Unfortunate Miss Bailey. Written in 1821 by Samuel Woodworth, it was first sung in New Orleans in 1822 by Noah M. Ludlow. When Ludlow first performed the song, the audience was filled with boatmen who had floated down the Mississippi River from Kentucky; they refused to let him leave the stage until he sang it two more times.Watson p.124Faragher pp.334,335 The \\"half horse and half alligator\\" description was a common expression for boatmen like Mike Fink and other backwoodsmen of the period. Use Henry Clay Throughout the term of Andrew Jackson, \\"Hunters of Kentucky\\" proved to be a popular song, and Jackson used it for his 1824 and 1828 campaign. This is ironic as Jackson's \\"fieriest rival\\", Henry Clay, was the one from Kentucky; Jackson was actually from Tennessee, near Nashville. Due to a copy of the song being depicted on the front cover of Davy Crockett's Almanack of Wild Sports in the West, it is thought that \\"Hunters of Kentucky\\" might have been sung during the Texas War of Independence, but this is speculation as no other evidence supports the song being sung during that conflict. However, Americans who entered Canada in 1837 and 1838 did sing the song.Hickey pp.347,348 \\"Hunters of Kentucky\\" propagated various beliefs about the war. One of them was calling the Pennsylvania Rifle the Kentucky Rifle. Another was crediting the riflemen with the victory of the Battle of New Orleans, when it could be said it was Jackson's artillery that was actually responsible for the win. Finally, one stanza said that the British planned to ransack New Orleans, which was unlikely to happen.Hickey p.348 Lyrics Ye gentlemen and ladies fair Who grace this famous city, Just listen, if you've time to spare, While I rehearse a ditty; And for the opportunity Conceive yourselves quite lucky, For 'tis not often that you see A hunter from Kentucky. Refrain: Oh Kentucky, the hunters of Kentucky! Oh Kentucky, the hunters of Kentucky! Alligators We are a hardy, free-born race, Each man to fear a stranger; Whate'er the game, we join in chase, Despising toil and danger. And if a daring foe annoys, Whate'er his strength and forces, We'll show him that Kentucky boys Are alligator horses. Refrain I s'pose you've read it in the prints, How Packenham attempted To make old Hickory Jackson wince, But soon his scheme repented; For we, with rifles ready cock'd, Thought such occasion lucky, And soon around the gen'ral flock'd, The hunters of Kentucky. Refrain You've heard, I s'pose, how New-Orleans Is fam'd for wealth and beauty‚Äî There's girls of ev'ry hue, it seems, From snowy white to sooty. So Packenham he made his brags, If he in fight was lucky, He'd have their girls and cotton bags, In spite of old Kentucky. Refrain Andrew Jackson But Jackson he was wide awake, And was not scar'd at trifles, For well he knew what aim we take, With our Kentucky rifles: So he led us down by Cypress swamp, The ground was low and mucky; There stood John Bull in martial pomp, And here was old Kentucky. Refrain A bank was rais'd to hide our breasts, Not that we thought of dying, But that we always like to rest, Unless the game is flying. Behind it stood our little force, None wished it to be greater, For ev'ry man was half a horse, And half an alligator. Refrain They did not let our patience tire, Before they show'd their faces; We did not choose to waste our fire, So snugly kept our places. But when so near we saw them wink, We thought it time to stop 'em, And 'twould have done you good, I think, To see Kentuckians drop 'em. Refrain The British found, 'twas vain to fight, Where lead was all their booty, And so they wisely took to flight, And left us all the beauty. And now, if danger e'er annoys, Remember what our trade is; Just send for us Kentucky boys, And we'll protect ye, ladies.

Purpose Hydraulic calculations are often required to prove the flow of water (or water mixed with additives like firefighting foam concentrate) through piping networks for the purpose of suppressing or extinguishing a fire. The full hydraulic calculation procedure is defined in the applicable reference model codes such as published by NFPA (National Fire Protection Association),National Fire Protection Association. http://www.nfpa.org or EN 12845 Fixed firefighting system ‚Äì Automatic sprinkler systems ‚Äì Design, installation and maintenance. Hydraulic calculations provide a verifiable analysis of the 3 primary components of a fire suppression system: 1) The water delivery requirements to suppress a possible fire 2) The available water supply 3) The network of piping that will deliver this water in the event of a fire. Water delivery requirements Requirements for the density of water discharge are usually specified by an applicable model code such as NFPA 13, NFPA 15, EN 12845, BS 9251, NFPA 750 CP 52, ASIB, and AS2118.1. Other possible international and insurance underwriter fire design standards may apply to projects. The probable intensity and extent of a possible fire inside the building is determined by factors including the building use, the building height, the items expected to be stored or processed, and the arrangement in which these items are stored. These variables are compared to tables and values expressed in the model codes. In turn, these tables and values in the model codes are based primarily on decades' worth of fire tests but may also be based on fire growth modeling. Available water supply The water available is often determined by means of a water flow test (opening a fire hydrant and recording the water pressures and gallons flow per minute). Some municipal water jurisdictions may provide their own estimate of available water supplies. In locations where a municipal connection is not possible or practical, the needed piping network may draw water from an open (lake, pond, river) or closed (underground, aboveground, elevated tank) water source. Where the water supply is drawn from a static supply like an underground tank or a pond, hydraulic calculations will also determine what pressure must be added to deliver the water. This pressure is typically applied by means of a fire pump or pressurized water storage tank. System piping network Suppression system piping networks are usually arranged in one of 3 configurations: Tree, Loop, or Grid. Tree systems may be imagined as a network of piping starting with a larger trunk and branching out to progressively smaller pipes with fire sprinklers or other devices. Looped systems may have a larger pipe that runs throughout a building and ties back to itself near the start, with smaller branches reaching out from this 'loop'. A gridded system may be imagined as similar to the lines on a gridiron football field, where the sidelines would be 2 parallel larger 'main' pipes and the yardage lines would be smaller 'branch' lines connecting the two sidelines. Gridded systems provide multiple paths for the water to travel to any point in the system. This arrangement can be very effective at reducing friction-pressure losses in the system. Most design standards require application of the Hazen-Williams method for determining frictional pressure losses through the piping network as water passes through it. Tree and Loop systems are simple enough that the hydraulic calculations could be performed by hand. Because hydraulic calculations for gridded systems require an iterative process to balance the water flow through all possible water paths, these calculations are most often performed by computer software. Today most calculations on all types of piping networks are performed by computer software. The sizes of network components can be more readily modified and recalculated on a computer than through a manual process. The 2013 NFPA 13 handbook includes a supplement that describes some of the application theory and processes applied when performing hydraulic calculations.

Overview The Ormond Mound (a burial mound that can be classified as an earthwork or conical mound and is defined as a heap of earth placed over prehistoric tombs or remains} has been preserved as an intact burial mound in eastern Florida. The site was turned into a city park in 1982 due to the efforts of the community. In 1982, the owner of the property that the mound was constructed on wanted the mound removed. Controversy surfaced in the community as the property owner attempted to level the land in order to build a house. As a result of public outrage, the community‚Äôs and Volusia Anthropological Society's demand for the site to be classified as a historical monument, the Ormond Mound and surrounding area was purchased by the city. Government officials hired archaeologists in an effort to validate who built the site and for what purpose. The archaeologists concluded that the mound was constructed by Timucuan Indians, also identified as the St. Johns people. The Timucuan were inhabitants of the area before European settlers. History It has been estimated that over 100 individual burials are in Ormond Mound, based on salvage excavations that were conducted in 1982. As more bodies were deposited into the area and were covered with sand and other minerals, the earthwork took its \\"distinctive mounded appearance\\". Most of these remains were laid to rest during the late St. Johns period, after A.D. 800. The remains were oftentimes buried with their most prized possessions. Apart from human bones, items found after the site was analyzed included utensils, Indian beads, Spanish trading beads, and pottery sherds. A charnel house, a structure used to store bodies prior to burial, was located near the Ormond Mound. These structures were separate from the village and were used by the St. Johns people to prepare the corpses of mostly high- ranking and important people for the afterlife. The dead were laid out on wooden racks and allowed to decompose. A charnel house attendant, usually a high priest or a bonepicker, would carefully remove the flesh from the bones as they decomposed. The job of a bonepicker was known throughout the community as one of the most prestigious jobs to have.True Natives: The Prehistory of Volusia County (1992), By Dana Ste. Claire, The Museum of Arts and Sciences, Daytona BeachA Nature Wooing at Ormond by the Sea (1902), By Willis Stanley Blatchley After the bodies dried away, the charnel house priest would end up with individual sets of cleaned bones.. Each set of bones was bundled up and buried in mounds during special ceremonies. This method accounts for the many skeletons found in burial mounds.

Prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, al-Shifa was the only hospital in Gaza. When the Egyptians administered the Gaza Strip after the war, the quarantine and febrile diseases department was relocated to another area in the city and al-Shifa developed into the central hospital of Gaza. Initially, a department for internal medicine was established, followed by a new wing for surgery, and subsequently new buildings for pediatrics and ophthalmology were added to the hospital.Husseini and Barnea, 2002, p.135.

They established a new health administration for the Gaza region, later building several clinics throughout the city that were attended by doctors from the hospital.Husseini and Barnea, 2002, p.136. The largest department in al-Shifa was internal medicine (100 beds), then pediatrics (70 beds), surgery (50 beds), ophthalmology (20 beds) and gynecology (10 beds).Husseini and Barnea, 2002, p.137. =Israeli occupation and Palestinian control= Erik Fosse.

What is now WTBBL began in 1906 when the Seattle Public Library (SPL) introduced the first Braille service in Washington State. Early Braille transcriber groups included the Junior League, Seattle Council of Jewish Women, and the Seattle chapter of the American Red Cross. In 1919, SPL assigned Fanny Howley part-time to specific duty as a librarian to serve the blind. In 1931, under the Pratt Smoot Act, the collection became part of a national Braille and talking books network under the Library of Congress. From 1934, it served as a regional library serving Washington, Montana and Alaska. In 1968 the Montana State Library established its own talking book service, and a few years later took over Braille service for Montana residents as well. The Alaska State Library in Juneau was established as a sub-regional library in 1973 and a full regional library in July 1976, since which time WTBBL has served only Washington State.About WTBBL and the Building , WTBBL official site], 2008. Accessed online January 23, 2009. The Library for the Blind moved in 1945 from the old downtown Carnegie Library to the Fremont branch. By 1954 it had become SPL's Division for the Blind, and moved to the basement of the Susan Henry Memorial Library on Seattle's Capitol Hill,Alan J.

At the beginning of 1967, the program was extended to any handicapped person certified as unable to read conventional printed materials. Accordingly, in 1973 the program became the Washington Regional Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. On March 12 of that year, it moved to new quarters at the King County Library building at 811 Harrison Street. 10 days later they began their Radio Talking Book Service. In 1975 Washington State took over the funding of the library from the city of Seattle. Seattle Public Library continued to operate the library on a contract basis until July 1, 2008, when the state took over direct responsibility for its operation. The library first moved to its current location at what was then 821 Lenora Street October 1, 1983. In 1985, circulation was automated so that blind staff members could use adaptive equipment to access the system. From July 20, 1996 to July 12, 1997, the library was located in temporary quarters nearby at 717 Virginia Street (the Love Building) so that the facility at Ninth and Lenora could be renovated and made more suitable for its purpose; among other things, the library gained indoor parking. =Institutional names and head librarians= The library began its existence in 1906 without a formal name, as a service of the Seattle Public Library. By 1945, the program had become known as the Library for the Blind; by 1954 this had become the SPL Division for the Blind. In 1973, it became the Washington Regional Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (WRLBPH), and in 1975 became a state-funded, rather than city- funded, library. On January 1, 1994 the present name of Washington Talking Book & Braille Library came into effect. In 1919, Fanny Howley became the first librarian formally assigned by SPL to services for the blind; she served in this role until 1932. Drusilla Dorland served as acting head librarian from 1932 to 1937, succeeded by Stephanie Howley, head librarian from 1937 to 1952 and Florence Grannis 1952‚Äì1960. When Grannis left in 1952 to head the Iowa Library for the Blind, Marcia Finseth became head librarian and served until 1974. Sharon Hammer became regional librarian 1974-1979, seeing through the transition to state funding. Jan Ames became interim regional librarian on September 5, 1978 and January 2, 1979 became WRLBPH (later WTBBL) Director until retiring on September 29, 2002. Gloria Leonard, served as acting director December 2, 2002 to December 2, 2003; she then became director, but moved to Seattle Public Library in April 2008, as the state was taking over operation of WTBBL. From April 28, 2008, Danielle King (now Miller) has served as Program Manager at WTBBL, under the aegis of the Washington State Library and Washington State Office of Secretary of State; she retains this position as of November 2010. Media and services A studio for recording \\"talking books\\". WTBBL studio As early as 1934, the library introduced talking books on special 33‚Öì RPM phonograph records; at the time, normal records were all 78s. In 1962, 16‚Öî RPM records were introduced, and still later 8‚Öì RPM flexible discs. These formats remained in service until 2001. They were superseded because in 1969 the National Library Service had started a cassette talking book program. The Radio Talking Book Service was founded March 22, 1973. It became the Radio Learning Service in 1977 and the Evergreen Radio Reading Service on April 25, 1983. The library began doing professional Brailling and taping services in July 1975, and \\"revitalized\\" the Braille program in 1985. The radio reading service remained in operation until August 15, 2014, when it was discontinued due to loss of funding. A formal children's program was established in 1986. The current building The WTBBL's two-story Streamline Moderne building at 2021 Ninth Avenue in Seattle (the corner of Ninth and Lenora Street) was previously a Dodge dealership, the anchor of Westlake Avenue's now departed auto row. The building was designed by Seattle architectural firm Naramore, Bain, Brady, and Johanson (predecessor to present-day NBBJ). The interior was remodeled in 1997 to better serve as a library.

Joint accounts are commonly opened by close relatives (such as by a married couple) or by business partners, but it can be used in other circumstances, such as by a club committee. Normally, any person can deposit funds into a joint account, but when opening an account the joint account holders may indicate to the financial institution whether a single account holder may make withdrawals or whether the consent of other account holders is required. A joint account is not the same as adding an authorized signatory or additional cardholder to an account, a person who is authorized by the account holder to effect transactions on the account, an arrangement under which the primary account holder remains fully and solely liable for all transactions on the account. Accounts by corporate entities are not, in themselves, joint accounts. In some jurisdictions there is a significant legal distinction between joint account holders being described as ‚Äúand‚Äù rather than as ‚Äúor‚Äù. If joint account holders are described with an ‚Äúand‚Äù, a survivor may have difficulty accessing funds in the joint account on the death of one account holder.  Opening an account When opening a joint bank account, the account holders need to decide who and how the account is to be operated, and instruct the financial institution accordingly. They would decide the signatories on the account. For example, withdrawals may require any account holder to sign a withdrawal or all parties to sign the withdrawal or ‚Äúany two account holders‚Äù to sign, or a particular account holder with any other account holder, or some other instructions. Many jurisdictions allow unincorporated businesses (such as partnerships) to open a joint bank account under its business name, as distinct from the account being described by the full or partial names of the joint account holders. Proof of registration of the business name may be required. Normally, a credit card account cannot be opened jointly, and the same normally applies to loyalty programs. In the case of joint loan accounts, the account holders are jointly and severally liability for the outstanding debit balance of the account. Operation of account Normally, any person can deposit funds into a joint account, but withdrawals from the account must be effected in accordance with the instructions given when opening the account. The joint account holders may authorise particular named individual/s to operate on the account, and instruct the financial institution accordingly. These individuals must be natural persons, and cannot be described by title (such as ‚Äútreasurer‚Äù or ‚Äúdirector‚Äù) and any change of signatories must be promptly advised to the financial institution. Any joint account holder can normally instruct the financial institution to put a freeze on the account, though all account holders would normally be required to act jointly to unfreeze the account. Rights of survivorship One of the main issues relating to joint accounts are rights of survivorship, that is, if one of the joint account holders dies, whether the surviving account holder/s are entitled to the balance of the account. Many husbands and wives open joint bank accounts as a cheap and easy way to avoid probate, and parent-child joint bank account holders may do the same. In some jurisdictions, passing funds in such situations may still be subject to gift duties and/or inheritance taxes. =In the United States= In the United States, there are typically two types of joint accounts: survivorship accounts and convenience accounts. Any joint owner of the account may withdraw funds during the lifetime of both owners, and most states have statutes protecting the bank from claims brought by one joint owner against the bank if the other owner \\"wrongfully\\" withdraws funds from the joint account. The distinction between survivorship and convenience accounts matters at the death of one of the owners. If the joint account is a survivorship account, the ownership of the account goes to the surviving joint account holder. Joint survivorship accounts are often created in order to avoid probate. If two individuals open a joint account and one of them dies, the other person is entitled to the remaining balance and liable for the debt of that account. If the account is a convenience account, if the person who placed the funds originally in the account dies, the joint owner does not become the owner of the account. Instead, the account becomes a probate asset of the deceased person. If the joint holder dies, who was simply put on the account for \\"convenience\\" purposes, the original owner of the account continues to own the account, unaffected by the death of the convenience account holder. How to tell whether the account is a survivorship account or a convenience account will depend on the bank's account opening forms. The form will typically include a choice for designating the account as a joint account with right of survivorship (\\"JTWROS\\") or a joint account for convenience purposes. A special type of joint account with right of survivorship, called a tenancy by the entireties account, is used for survivorship accounts between spouses. This special type of tenancy by the entireties account will typically offer the account holders protection from creditors under applicable state law.  Transaction accounts  Sometimes a temporary joint account is opened by two parties entering into a transaction where one party needs a security for the fulfilment of the transaction and the other party has to pay the sum (deposit), being the security for the other party. Any payment from the joint account, or return of the deposit from the joint account, will only be possible if both parties sign a joint written instruction to the bank. It is not possible that only one of the parties gives instruction for payments of the joint account. Som banks are not interested in opening temporary joint accounts, as they are normally used for one transaction only, there are specialised parties or companies open such accounts as trustees. A temporary joint account is normally closed after the transaction for which it was opened has been concluded. Temporary joint accounts may be used in transactions in which large sums of money are involved as an alternative to a letter of credit or escrow account.

Skevos was born and raised in Kalymnos City or Pothia, the capital of the island Kalymnos, Greece. Skevos was a member of a local wealthy, influential, distinguished and aristocratic family on the island. The family of Skevos had built the local hospital and local orphanage on the island, and through this they became local benefactors. His brother was a local prominent citizen called Kleanthes Zervos and his nephew was the local Christian Bishop of Kalymnos, Nikephoros Zervos whom in 1905 founded and established the Nikephoros High School, the first high school set up in Kalymnos. In front of the high school, there is a statue bust dedicated to Nikephoros Zervos. Skevos in his student years was a traditional free naked sponge diver in Kalymnos. Skevos dived with a traditional and multi-purpose tool called a Skandalopetra, which was used as a steering wheel/base tied as a line of communication with the boat. Diving for sponges is a part of the traditional diving heritage of Greece and the Aegean Sea. In 1910, Skevos was the first surgeon to perform the testicle transplantation from an ape to a man. This operation was successful. In 1934, this surgery was officially recognised by the Russian Surgeon Serge Voronoff. In 1919, Skevos assisted the Greek Politician Eleftherios Venizelos who traveled to the Paris Peace Conference in regaining the Dodecanese as a part of the modern state of Greece. On March 7, 1948, he was a paragon of the Central Dodecanese Committee and was present in Rhodes, when the United Nations, returned the Dodecanese region to the then government of Greece. Skevos was a Medical Professor of the School of Medicine at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. There Skevos developed a system that allowed him to examine a patient from a distance. This examination was concerning auscultation and cardiac pulses. The data could be transmitted in any place around the world. Virtues of the system were demonstrated in several experiments conducted in plenary sessions of the Athens Medical Society at the National University of Athens, at the National Technical University of Athens and at the Athens Academy during the signals were transmitted from several Athens hospitals and various Greek cities. His scientific research was published in the Annals of the Athens Medical Society (1946‚Äì1956). His system was proposed to be used on board of the Greek Ships that were offering regular service between Piraeus and New York City. The communication at this time could not be afforded and the system was not used. Skevos in his elder years married, however he had no children. In his honor the \\"disease of the naked sponge divers\\" was named \\"Skevos Zervos disease\\". As a posthumous honor, the local Kalymnian Government erected a life-size statue of him.

P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar believes that in the pre-Pallava period, this region was the southernmost outpost of Sanskrit culture. He cites the etymological derivation of the word \\"Kanchipuram\\" and other evidence in support of his claim. However, despite such claims, Kanchipuram is believed to have been mentioned in the Tamil epic Manimekhalai. In the 4th century AD, Kanchipuram emerged from an obscure past to become the capital of the Pallava Empire. The city was at the height of its power during the 7th century AD when it was visited by the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang.  Etymology  Some scholars believe that Kanchipuram might have been derived from the \\"Kanjiyur\\" which is mentioned in early Tamil poems.P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar, Pg 323 Kanjiyur is a place in the Chola country and its name means \\"place surrounded by Kanji trees\\". Kanjiyur is mentioned in several early texts, one among them being the Pu·πüanƒÅ·πâ≈´·πüu. However, Dravidologist and professor of history, P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar, in his book History of the Tamils from the Earliest Times to 600AD, claims that the Kanjiyur mentioned in early Tamil poems was not Kanchipuram at all but a different town altogether.P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar, Pg 322 Srinivasa Iyengar claims that Kanchipuram was a Sanskrit word and that the town had no Tamil name. In support of his claim, he states that Kanchipuram is mentioned in the books of the Sanskrit grammarian Patanjali, who lived in the 3rd-2nd century BC. On the contrary, the first references to Kanchipuram in Tamil literature, was in PerumpƒÅ·πáƒÅ·πü·πüuppa·π≠ai, a eulogy of Ilandiraiyan, which was written as late as the 2nd century AD. Here, though, Kanchi is not mentioned in its Sanskrit form Kanchi, but in its Prakrit form Kacci. On basis of this evidence, Srinivasa Iyengar concludes that Kanchipuram might have been the southernmost outpost of Sanskrit culture.  Northern frontier of the Ancient Tamil country  The northernmost province of the ancient Tamil country was the district of Aruva (present-day South Arcot district). The regions beyond Aruva were known as Aruvavadadalai. The Kanchipuram district had no specific name until the late Pallava period when it got the name Tondaimandalam.  History  = Pre- historic Kanchipuram = Henry Bruce Foote's discovery of pre-historic stone axe at Pallavaram in 1863 indicates that the region might have been occupied as early as the Stone Ages.Muthiah, Pg 129 Archaeological findings from a later period even indicate a thriving Iron Age settlement. Animal fossils and stone implements found at kanchipuram to the north-west of Chennai city could very well be over 85000 years old.Sastri, Pg 44 = 'Dravida' = The earliest references of Kanchipuram have been in the Sanskrit texts of Patanjali. The Dravida Kingdom of the Mahabharatha must have been centred on the Kanchipuram region.P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar, Pg 325 According to one tradition, Chandragupta Maurya's minister Chanakya was a native of Dravida. One of Chanakya's various names was Dramila, the Sanskrit form of \\"Tamilian\\".P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar, Pg 326 Kanchipuram is also mentioned as Satyavrataksetra in the Bhagavata Purana, after the king Satyavrata who ruled over the region. Eventually, all the kings of Kanchi until the time of the Pallavas, held the title \\"Satyaputra\\" or the \\"son of Satyavrata\\".P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar, Pg 327 = Rise of the Agamic cults = The Kanchipuram region is one of the first regions in the Tamil country to witness the rise of the Agamic cults. Sanskrit texts of the centuries which immediately precede the Christian era mention Kanchipuram amongst the seven holy temple cities in India.P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar, Pg 328 A number of Buddhist monasteries were built during the time of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka.P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar, Pg 329 Buddhist and Jain relics in the region attest to fairly significant Buddhist and Jain presence in the city at the time.

It spans from the death of his predecessor Hong Taiji (r. 1626‚Äì1643) in September 1643, to the emperor's own death on 5 February 1661, seven days into the eighteenth year of the Shunzhi reign period. These dates do not correspond perfectly with the Shunzhi era itself, which started on 8 February 1644‚Äîon New Year's Day of the lunisolar year following the emperor's accession‚Äîand ended on 17 February 1662 (the last day of the 18th year of Shunzhi), more than one solar year after the emperor's death.

His death threatens to split the Manchus just as they are preparing to attack the Ming.. *September 26: a Deliberative Council of princes and high officials is convened and decides that five-year-old Fulin, Hong Taiji's ninth son, will succeed his father, but that Hong Taiji's half-brother Dorgon and Jirgalang will be his co-regents. This deal is a compromise between those who wanted to keep the throne in Hung Taiji's descent (the main candidate was Hong Taiji's eldest son Hooge) and those who supported Dorgon. *October 8: at the age of six sui, Fulin officially becomes Emperor of the Qing dynasty.. =1644= *February 8: in Xi'an, Li Zicheng founds the \\"Great Shun\\" dynasty and proclaims himself King. *February 17: Jirgalang willingly yields control of all official matters to his co-regent Dorgon.. *March 5: Dorgon sends an amicable letter to Li Zicheng proposing that they \\"devise a plan in common to unite their forces\\" against the Ming.. *March 17: the Shun army occupies Taiyuan in Shanxi. *April 5: Seeing the progress of rebel armies in north China, the Chongzhen Emperor issues a call for the immediate help of any military commandant in the empire.. *April 24: Li Zicheng enters Beijing, the capital of the Ming empire. *April 25: the Chongzhen Emperor commits suicide on a hill behind the Forbidden City. *April 26: Wu Sangui, a powerful Ming general, moves his army through Shanhai Pass (at the eastern end of the Great Wall) and marches toward Beijing in response to the emperor's distress call. When he hears that the capital has fallen, Wu returns to fortify Shanhai Pass.. Wu's departure from the fortified city of Ningyuan, where Ming armies had defeated Qing founder Nurhaci in 1626, leaves all territory outside the Great Wall under Qing control. *April 29: the victorious Li Zicheng holds an audience with several thousand Ming officials outside the Donghua Gate of the Forbidden City. Assisted by his main Grand Secretary Niu Jinxing (ÁâõÈáëÊòü), Li selected 92 officials to serve in the Shun government. The remaining literati are given over to Shun generals for punishment.. *May 5: Wu Sangui routs an army led by Tang Tong, which Li Zicheng had despatched to attack Shanhai Pass.. *May 10: Tang Tong's defeated army returns toward Shanhai Pass with reinforcements, but is again defeated by Wu Sangui. Wu takes the city of Yongping (Ê∞∏Âπ≥) on the road to Beijing. *May 13: words reach the Qing capital of Shengjing that Li Zicheng has been brutalizing former Ming officials and the population of Beijing. Grand Secretary Fan Wencheng uses these news to argue for a Qing intervention in China.. Dorgon agrees to mount a military expedition to punish the rebels and occupy the Central Plains of China.. *May 14: Dorgon leads the Qing \\"Grand Army\\" out of Shengjing and starts marching south toward the Great Wall. *May 18: After the defeat of two of his armies a few days earlier, Li Zicheng decides to take Shanhai Pass himself: he leaves Beijing with an army of 60,000 troops., note 212. *May 20: two of Wu Sangui's lieutenants arrive at Dorgon's camp at the Liao River carrying a message from their master asking the Manchus to help Wu defeat Li Zicheng's bandits and restore the Ming dynasty in return for \\"great profits\\" (Â§ßÂà©). (date of arrival at the Manchus' camp) and 300‚Äì1 (content of the letter). Dorgon sends a letter back to Wu Sangui offering. Later that day the Manchus hear for the first time that the Chongzhen emperor was dead. Still on that day, but as a result of earlier plans, small groups of Qing troops start to cross the Great Wall to distribute written proclamations announcing that the Qing army will not harm the population and will only kill Li Zicheng's bandits.. *May 25: By that date, Li Zicheng's army was already camping in the outskirts of Shanhai Pass, near the Sha River a few kilometers west of the Shanhai Pass garrison; Wu Sangui sends his troops to confront him there.. Dorgon receives a letter confirming that Wu Sangui has accepted to work for the Qing: he takes his army on a forced march toward Shanhai Pass.. *May 26: having covered more than 150 kilometers in 24 hours, Dorgon's troops settle eight kilometers away from the Pass to rest for a few hours. They are awoken at midnight to continue marching. *May 27: Battle of Shanhai Pass. At dawn Dorgon's main army reaches the gates of Shanhaiguan, where Dorgon receives Wu Sangui's formal surrender. The armies deploy for battle: placed in the vanguard, Wu's troops are ordered to charge the Shun army, but they are unable to break the rebels' line and suffer heavy casualties. By the late afternoon, they are on the verge of defeat when a sandstorm starts blowing on the battlefield.. Dorgon chooses this moment to intervene: galloping around Wu's right flank, Qing bannermen destroys Li's left wing. The Shun army is defeated and retreats chaotically toward Yongping; thousands are massacred.. *May 28: Li Zicheng retreats from Yongping toward Beijing.. Wu Sangui is named Prince Pingxi; his remaining troops shave their heads and join the Qing forces., note 262. *May 31: Li Zicheng reenters Beijing with his troops, which started to loot the capital.. *June 3: as a \\"final gesture of defiance\\" after his decisive defeat at Shanhai Pass, Li Zicheng officially declares himself Emperor of the Great Shun at the Wuying dian Ê≠¶Ëã±ÊÆø.

The Beijing population massacres rebels who had not fled; nearly two thousand are killed.. *June 5: led by Dorgon, Qing troops are welcomed into the capital; the Beijing population is shocked because it was expecting Wu Sangui to bring back the Ming heir apparent.. *June 7: Dorgon issues special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepts to cut their hair and to surrender, the officials will be allowed to stay at their post.. (See June 25.) *June 25: because peasant rebellions quickly erupted around the capital in reaction to the haircutting order of June 7, Dorgon issues an edict saying that people will be allowed to arrange their hair the way they want., pp. 420‚Äì422. gives the date as June 28. *July 14: Dorgon declares Beijing (which he calls \\"Yanjing\\" Ááï‰∫¨) the new capital of the Qing.

Plot Tyler Clarke (Kelly Overton) receives a cryptic voice-mail from her sister Jessica (Wynn Everett) pleading for help but giving no explanation of the trouble she is in. Tyler makes several attempts to call her sister but to no avail. In a moment of desperation, she takes the red-eye to New York to find Jessica. Upon her arrival in the city, she realises that her sister is nowhere to be found and has seemingly disappeared without a trace.

Tyler is both shocked and horrified to discover that her sister is now one of them. She is now forced to ask the ultimate question, is she ready to risk her own life to save her sister's? Cast Production Reception Justin Tanzer of Off Off Off gave a mixed review of the film, writing that the film \\"lacks believability and high stakes. It is short on thought. It takes place in isolation, lacking meaningful interaction between the characters and anybody outside conspiracy-land\\", but granting the \\"movie's most redeeming feature is that it's well crafted from a technical point of view.

Ugandi is a former British Royal Navy vessel built by Woolston Yard of Southampton-based shipbuilders Vosper Thornycroft. The ship is the third and final Sandown-class vessel to join the naval force after its mine countermeasures vessel modernization programme. She is named after an ancient Estonian county Ugandi, between the east coast of Lake V√µrtsj√§rv and west coast of Lake Pskov, bordered by Vaiga, M√µhu, Nurmekund, Sakala, Latgale, and Pskov. History Bridport was built by Woolston Yard of Southampton-based shipbuilders Vosper Thornycroft as one of the 12 ship class of Sandown-class minehunters. In July 2004, the UK Ministry of Defence announced that as part of the restructuring of the Navy, the two oldest and one other Sandown-class minehunters would be retired by April 2005. Bridport was decommissioned and was then laid up awaiting a buyer or disposal. In September 2006, Estonia signed a contract to acquire the three vessels. The former HMS Bridport was modernized and overhauled in Bay 1 of the Syncrolift at Rosyth. The project was started ahead of schedule to deconflict the programme. On 22 January 2009, the Estonian Navy flag was hoisted on the ship and she was named ENS Ugandi during a ceremony at Rosyth Dockyard. It reached Estonia on 24 February 2009, the Estonian Independence Day, under the command of Lieutenant Senior Grade Marek Mardo. Since 28 October 2012, the ship carries the coat of arms of Otep√§√§. Between 2012-2013, the ship had three of its Perkins CV8 generators replaced with SDMO V300 generators. On 30 August 2013, Lieutenant Senior Grade Marek Mardo became the commander of the ship, replacing Lieutenant Commander Villu Klesmann, who had been its commander since 2009. On 17 December 2018, Lieutenant Senior Grade Martin Aeltermann replaced Lieutenant Junior Grade Jaanus Pulk- Piatkowski as commander of the ship. The ship would go through a modernization programme the following year. Characteristics The vessel carries clearance divers and Remote Control Mine Disposal Systems. Unlike the previous , the vessel was built from glass reinforced plastic to reduce her magnetic signature. Other parts of the ship were constructed from non-ferrous metals for a similar reason. They are propelled by Voith Schneider Propellers and are very maneuverable due to two bow thrusters which gives an advantage when working with mines. She differs from the previous two Sandown-class vessels delivered to the Estonian Navy, as she has been fitted with a ZU-23-2 twin mount, 23mm cannon system and a Klein 5000 sidescan sonar. The ship's motto is in Latin: Semper Ante - which in English means: \\"Always In Front\\". The coat of arms was designed by Priit Herodes.

Rampino (c. 1939 Ozone Park, Queens ‚Äì 20 December 2010, New Hartford, NY), also known as \\"Tony Roach\\", was a Gambino crime family mobster who was involved in truck hijacking and drug trafficking. Biography He earned the nickname \\"Tony Roach\\" or simply \\"Roach\\" because of his vague physical resemblance to the insect, the cockroach, the name assumed a double meaning not too long afterward when Rampino started smoking copious amounts of marijuana. He was involved in drug trafficking. He became a close friend of John Gotti, Angelo Ruggiero, Nicholas Corozzo , Leonard DiMaria and Pavle Stanimirovic. Anthony's passion was stickball and being a successful thief. He was a cadaverous looking man with huge hands and long arms that seemed to reach down past his knees, and an odd rubbery-looking face. He liked to contort his face into all kinds of horrible grimaces in front of a mirror, years of practice allowed him, at a second's notice, to shape his face into something like The Phantom of the Opera. He firmly believed that such faces would frighten any enemy. He had been troubled with a severe heroin addiction in the 1960s which was well known among his criminal associates, but had successfully kicked the drug habit by 1979. Former friend Sammy Gravano later said, \\"It was all around amongst us that people with John were heavy, heavy in drugs; personally I don't believe John ever did it himself. But he had to know what was going on. I mean, there's Genie (Gene Gotti), his own brother, Angelo Ruggiero, who he grew up with - the other guys with him - John Carneglia, Edward Lino Tony Roach (Anthony Rampino), who not only had a reputation for drugs but was an ex-junkie.\\" Anthony and Wilfred Johnson served as John Gotti's chief loan collectors for the crew. Drug bust and arrest On June 28, 1987, he was arrested for selling $30,000 worth of heroin to an undercover police officer in Ozone Park, Queens. He was sentenced to twenty-five(25) years in a federal prison for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, which carries a sentence of fifteen years to life in prison. His bail was set at $150,000. Death Rampino was admitted to St. Luke's Hospital in New Hartford on December 4, 2010. The colorful mob character had been suffering from heart and respiratory ailments, according to court filings. He died 16 days later in the same hospital.

Before the amendments were made, the Constitution granted rulers who have violated the law not to be prosecuted by the criminal court unless he voluntarily wishes to surrender his legal immunity.Islam in Malaysian Foreign Policy, Nair, pg 133 The amendments were made at a time when the Malaysian monarchy witnessed a deteriorating relationship with the Malaysian government. During the late-1980s and the early-1990s, a series of controversial incidents involving the rulers cropped up, many of which came into a conflict of interest with several politicians.Government and Society in Malaysia, Crouch, pg 146 After two separate assault incidents by the Sultan of Johor and his younger son which occurred in 1992, the government was prompted to take up the initiative to call for the removal of legal immunity. The rulers were extremely unhappy with the government's calls for the removal of legal immunity, and initially dissented with the government. The government used a two-pronged approach of persuasion and coercion to obtain the assent of the rulers for their rulers. The rulers gave their assent for the government's proposals to remove the legal immunity, which was later implemented in March 1993. By some interpretations, these events leading up to the constitutional amendments was considered to be a constitutional crisis,About Malaysia, for all Malaysians , SOO EWE JIN, 2 December 2007, The Star (Malaysia) given that the federal government, who needed the endorsement of the Sultans to implement the law, refused and subsequently led to a brief standoff between both sides.Malaysian Politics Under Mahathir, Milne, Mauzy, pg 38 However, in most cases, the events leading up to the constitutional amendment was generally closely identified as a monarchy crisis rather than a constitutional crisis.The End of Empire and the Making of Malaya, Harper, pg 372 Background incidents =Gomez Incident= In later part of the year, two separate assault incidents involving members of the Johor royal family allegedly occurred‚ÄìAsian Bulletin, Asian Peoples' Anti-Communist League, Asian Peoples' Anti-Communist League (China : Republic : 1949‚Äì ), Asian-Pacific Anti-Communist League, APLFD (Organization), APACL Publications, 1993, pg 32 was aptly dubbed as the \\"Gomez Incident\\" by the media.Asian Bulletin, Asian Peoples' Anti-Communist League, Asian Peoples' Anti-Communist League (China : Republic : 1949‚Äì ), Asian- Pacific Anti-Communist League, APLFD (Organization), APACL Publications, 1993, pg 8 The first one occurred on 10 July 1992, when the second son of the Sultan Iskandar, the Sultan of Johor, Tunku Abdul Majid, flayed a Perak hockey goalkeeper, Mohamed Jaafar shortly after a hockey championship match between Perak and Johor, supposedly having lost his temper when the Perak team won the match by a penalty stroke.Kerajaan mansuh kekebalan raja Melayu: semua parti politik sokong, Petah, pg 89 The goalkeeper made a police report soon afterward which received attention from Parliament who pressured the Malaysian Hockey Confederation to issue Tunku Majid in October 1992, a ban of five years participation in any national hockey tournaments.Aliran Monthly, Aliran (Association), Aliran Kesedaran Negaran, 1984, pg 30 The Sultan, enraged by the decision issued to his son, exerted pressure on the state education department to issue orders to school hockey teams in Johor to boycott participation in national tournaments.Gomez lodges police report, Zaman: We will seek A-G's direction to investigate case, New Straits Times, 7 December, 19 92, pg 1, 4 The decision upset Douglas Gomez, a hockey coach, who criticised the education department for destroying the leadership and called for the resignation of all key office bearers of the Johor Hockey Association.Crux of the problem lies with the JHA, NEW STRAITS TIMES, 7 December 1992, p. 13 The criticisms by Gomez made the Sultan angry, so he summoned Gomez to the palace on 30 November where he was reprimanded and beaten by the Sultan, in front of his dumbstruck bodyguards,Islam Embedded: The Historical Development of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party PAS, Noor, Noor, pg 495 members of the Johor Military Force (JMF).

A special parliamentary session was held on 10 December 1992 which saw all 96 members of the Dewan Rakyat present to pass a unanimous resolution to curb the powers of the rulers if necessary.

The previous proposals offered only a delay of fifteen days for any legislation that were to be raised in parliament.Transitions in Malaysian society and politics: towards centralizing power (2004), pg 316 The Dewan Rakyat passed its implementation on 8 March 1993, while the Dewan Negara approved of its implementation on 30 March.

The Pahang royal family, in particular, was criticised for the way which they allegedly gained favourable timber forestry concession ratesUnion: Review timb er permits for royalty, New Straits Times, 15 December 1992, pg 2 and the unusually high shares which they were accorded in the timber forestry industry.Lim: given to Sultan, The Star, 18 December 1992, pg 2 The views of the Islamic Religious leaders were also well publicised, who criticised the royal excesses and even went as far as placing members of the royalty as equal members with the commoners in the eyes of Allah.Ulamas back constitutional change, New Straits Times, 1 January 1993, pg 2Qualities worthy of a Ruler in light of Islamic teachings, New Straits Times, 15 December 1992, pg 11Zaleha: Action was against Islamic teachings, New Straits Times, 21 January 1993, pg 2 Aftermath Another further constitutional amendment in May 1994 allowed any law that has been passed by both the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara to become law within 30 days, irrespective of whether the Agong had given his assent.Dictionary of the Modern Politics of South-East Asia, Leifer, pg 297Handbook of Federal Countries, 2002: A Project of the Forum of Federations, Griffiths, Nerenberg, pg 185 The new legislation further reduced the veto power of the Agong ‚Äî amended previously in 1983, which also sparked a constitutional crisis. The older bill stated that Rulers could withhold assent of a proposed amendment within 30 days once both houses of parliament pass a proposed amendment.Personalized Politics: The Malaysian State Under Mahathir, Hwang, pg 241 The new constitutional amendment took some interesting twists following its amendments: In 1996, a Singaporean filed to sue the Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang for defamation in the special court for the rulers, which was turned down by the Special Court, establishing the precedent that the right to sue a ruler only belongs to a Malaysian citizen. In 1998, then Tengku Idris (later Sultan Sharafuddin) of Selangor sued a company, Dikim Holdings in the High Court. In 1999, when his father, Sultan Salahuddin was elected as the Yang di- Pertuan Agong (Paramount Ruler) of Malaysia, Tengku Idris was appointed as Regent of Selangor. The case was referred to the Federal Court on whether the Regent is considered a ruler, which the court replied in the negative. In 2001, Sultan Salahuddin died and Tengku Idris ascended the Selangor throne. The case was referred to the Federal Court again, which the court ruled that the High Court had lost jurisdiction over the case, and the case must be withdrawn and refiled in the Special Court. In both cases, only the Special Court had authority to exercise jurisdiction over the rulers, whether they were to be tried or intended to try another party.Test case on right to sue Sultans , 20 August 2008, Shad Saleem Faruqi, The Star (Malaysia) The Yang di- Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan, Tuanku Ja'afar became the first ruler to have judgement made against him in the Special Court, whereby he was ordered to settle US$1 million in debts he had owed to a bank.New Ruler for Negeri Sembilan, 30 December 2008, The Straits Times The landmark verdict prompted his oldest son, the Regent of Negeri Sembilan, Tunku Naquiyuddin to advocate the restoration of rulers' immunity during a speech in November 2008. This raised concerns among the public, in view of the history of past royal excesses, but specifically the Gomez incident. Tunku Naquiyuddin, however, added further that immunity to rulers should not be extended to cases when rulers commit acts of criminality, such as assault.

His father's career took him to Southampton in 1898 where he remained until he retired. According to \\"The Alphabet of the Saints\\", \\"he had been taken to the Dell to watch his father but had been inspired by the exploits of two great Southampton 'keepers, Clawley and Robinson\\". Arthur Wood was given a trial in April 1913 and was taken on to the staff at The Dell. =Southampton= He made his first-team debut in the Southern League on 9 September 1914 in a 3‚Äì2 defeat at Luton, replacing Ernie Steventon. He retained his place for six matches before Steventon returned in October, followed by a longer spell from December to March. By the end of the 1914‚Äì15 season he had made 19 appearances, exactly half the league matches played, as well as playing in all four matches in the FA Cup. During the First World War, Wood enlisted in the Royal Engineers, but his military duties allowed him to turn out for Southampton in the various War Leagues. On the resumption of League football in 1919, Wood started as the first-choice keeper, and played in the opening 18 matches, before he was replaced by George Wilcock. Wilcock left Southampton at the end of the season and was replaced as first-choice 'keeper for Southampton's first season in the Football League by Tommy Allen.

From 1925‚Äì26 onwards, Clapton struggled in the league, finishing one place above the relegation zone for three consecutive seasons, before they were relegated to the Third Division South in 1929. By now, age was catching up with Wood and his appearances over the next two years were less regular until he retired in the summer of 1931.

Theologians regard the doctrine of papal primacy as having gradually developed in the West due to the convergence of a number of factors, e.g., the dignity of Rome as the only apostolic see in the West; the tradition that both Peter and Paul had been martyred there; Rome's long history as a capital of the Roman Empire; and its continuing position as the chief center of commerce and communication. Background In Roman Catholic theology, the doctrine of apostolic succession states that Christ gave the full sacramental authority of the church to the Twelve Apostles in the sacrament of Holy Orders, making them the first bishops. By conferring the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders on the apostles, they were given the authority to confer the sacrament of Holy Orders on others, thus consecrating more bishops in a direct lineage that can trace its origin back to the Twelve Apostles and Christ himself. This direct succession of bishops from the apostles to the present day bishops is referred to as apostolic succession. The Roman Catholic Church also holds that within the College of Apostles, Peter was picked out for the unique role of leadership and to serve as the source of unity among the apostles, a role among the bishops and within the church inherited by the pope as Peter's successor today. = Primacy of Peter the apostle = According to numerous records of the early Church Fathers, Peter was present in Rome, was martyred there, and was the first bishop of Rome. Dogma and traditions of the Catholic Church maintain that he served as the bishop of Rome for 25 years until 67 AD when he was martyred by NeroPennington, p. 2 (further information: Great Fire of Rome). The official Catholic position, as Eamon Duffy points out in his book Saints and Sinners: A History of the Popes, is that Jesus had essentially appointed Peter as the first pope,Duffy, ch. 1 though the respectful title \\"pope\\" (meaning, \\"father\\") developed at a later time. The New Testament evidence is briefly summarized: The New Testament does not contain an explicit record of the transmission of Peter's leadership, nor is the transmission of apostolic authority in general very clear. As a result, the Petrine texts of the New Testament have been subjected to differing interpretations from the time of the Church Fathers on. At least by the late second century, belief that Jesus granted Peter jurisdiction over the Church is reflected, when Clement of Alexandria wrote: \\"Who is the Rich man that is Saved? The blessed Peter, the chosen, the pre-eminent, the first of the disciples, for whom alone and Himself the Saviour paid tribute, [who] quickly seized and comprehended the saying\\" (Ch. 21), referring to Mk 10:28. Tertullian, while examining Scriptural teachings, legal precedents, and dogma surrounding monogamy and marriage (post AD 213), says of Peter, \\"Monogamist I am led to presume him by consideration of the Church, which, built upon him...\\" (\\"On Monogamy\\", Ch. 8): his certainty that the Church is built especially upon Peter is such that he simply refers to it in the context of another discussion. In a slightly later text (AD 220) \\"On Modesty\\", Tertullian writes at length about the significance of Matthew 16:18-19, \\"On this rock I will build my Church\\", and similar, emphasizing the singular, not plural, right, and condemning \\"wholly changing the manifest intention of the Lord, conferring (as that intention did) this (gift) personally upon Peter\\" (Ch. 21). Origen (c. AD 232) wrote also of \\"Peter, upon whom is built the Church of Christ\\" (Jurgens ¬ß479a). =Apostolic succession= Irenaeus compiled a list of succession of the bishops of Rome, including the immediate successors of Peter and Paul: Linus, Anacleutus, Clement, Evaristus, Alexander, and Sixtus. The Catholic Church currently considers these the successors of Peter, whom they consider the first pope, and through whom following popes would claim authority. The evolution of earlier tradition established both Peter and Paul as the forefathers of the bishops of Rome, from whom they received their position as chief shepherd (Peter) and supreme authority on doctrine (Paul).Schimmelpfennig, p. 27 To establish her primacy among the churches of the Western half of the empire, the bishops of Rome relied on a letter written in 416 by Innocent I to the Bishop of Gubbio, to show how subordination to Rome had been established. Since Peter was the only apostle (no mention of Paul) to have worked in the West, thus the only persons to have established churches in Italy, Spain, Gaul, Sicily, Africa, and the Western islands were bishops appointed by Peter or his successors. This being the case then, all congregations had to abide by the regulations set in Rome).Schimmelpfennig, p. 39 Ante-Nicean period Francis A. Sullivan \\"expressed agreement with the consensus of scholars that available evidence indicates that the church of Rome was led by a college of presbyters, rather than a single bishop, for at least several decades of the second century.\\" A Church hierarchy seems to have developed by the late 1st century and early 2nd century. Robert Williams says that the \\"origin and earliest development of episcopacy and monepiscopacy and the ecclesiastical concept of (apostolic) succession were associated with crisis situations in the early church.\\" This development was one response to the problem of church unity. Thus, the solution to division arising from heterodox teaching was the development of more standardized structures of ministry. One of these structures is the tri-partite form of church leadership consisting of episkopoi (overseers); presbyteroi (elders), as was the case with Jewish communities; and diakonoi (ministerial servants). Presbyters were ordained and assisted the bishop; as Christianity spread, especially in rural areas, the presbyters exercised more responsibilities and took distinctive shape as priests. Deacons also performed certain duties, such as tending to the poor and sick. The Didache, dating from AD 70 to 140, states \\"Appoint for yourselves therefore bishops and deacons worthy of the Lord\\". Ignatius of Antioch urged churches to adopt this structure and emphasizes unity, obedience, and the hierarchical relationship among the faithful and between the bishop and God. In the 2nd century this structure was supported by teaching on apostolic succession, where a bishop becomes the spiritual successor of the previous bishop in a line tracing back to the apostles themselves. Over the course of the second century, this organizational structure became universal and continues to be used in the Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches as well as in some Protestant denominations. Further elements of the hierarchical relationship are mentioned by St. Clement of Alexandria. In his Stromateis, he writes about \\"according to my opinion, the grades here in the Church, of bishops, presbyters, deacons, are imitations of the angelic glory, and of that economy which, the Scriptures say, awaits those who, following the footsteps of the apostles, have lived in perfection of righteousness according to the Gospel\\". Irenaeus compiled a list of papal succession, including the immediate successors of Peter and Paul Rome's role as arbiter =Stephen I= In the aftermath of the Decian persecution there were disagreements regarding how to deal with those who had lapsed; whether and under what conditions might they be readmitted to the Christian community. At the behest of Faustinus of Lyon and other bishops of Gaul, Cyprian of Carthage wrote Pope Stephen I (254-257) asking him to instruct the bishops of Gaul to condemn Marcianus of Arles (who refused to admit those who repented) and to elect another bishop in his stead. Mann, Horace. \\"Pope St. Stephen I.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 11 February 2020 In 250, St. Cyprian and St. Firmilian both wrote of the Bishop of Rome as successor of Peter, and the latter mentions how the Bishop of Rome decreed policy for other regions based on this succession. =Damasus I= In 376, Jerome was living as an ascetic in the desert of Chalcis, south-west of Antioch. Pope Damasus I had asked him to make a new translation of scripture. At that there were rival claimants for the See of Antioch, and Jerome wrote Pope Damasus I to ask who was the true bishop of the three claimants of the see of Antioch, and for clarification of a doctrinal issue: In 382 Jerome accompanied one of the claimants, Paulinus II of Antioch, to Rome, where Pope Damasus I (366-384) had convened a council to determine a canonical list of scripture. (Jerome then served as confidential secretary to the Pope for the next three years before heading to Bethlehem.) After the Edict of Milan =Decretals= The bishops of Rome sent letters which, though largely ineffectual, provided historical precedents which were used by later supporters of papal primacy. These letters were known as ‚Äòdecretals‚Äô from at least the time of Pope Siricius (384-399) to Leo I. They provided general guidelines to follow which later would become incorporated into canon law.Schimmelpfennig, p. 47 Thus it was \\"this attempt to implement the authority of the bishop of Rome, or at least the claim of authority, to lands outside Italy, which allows us to use the word 'pope' for bishops starting with Damasus (366-384) or Siricius.\\" Pope Siricius declared that no bishop could take office without his knowledge. Not until Pope Symmachus would a bishop of Rome presume to bestow a pallium (woolen garment worn by a bishop) on someone outside Italy. =St. Optatus= Saint Optatus clearly believed in a \\"Chair of Peter\\", calling it a gift of the Church and saying, as summarized by Henry Wace, that \\"Parmenian must be aware that the episcopal chair was conferred from the beginning on Peter, the chief of the apostles, that unity might be preserved among the rest and no one apostle set up a rival.\\" \\"You cannot deny that you are aware that in the city of Rome the episcopal chair was given first to Peter, the chair in which Peter sat, the same who was head that is why he is also called Cephasof all the Apostles; the one chair in which unity is maintained by all. Neither do other Apostles proceed individually on their own; and anyone who would set up another chair in opposition to that single chair would, by that very fact, be a schismatic and a sinner.\\"(Jurgens ¬ß1242) =Bishop of Rome becomes Rector of the whole Church= The power of the Bishop of Rome increased as the imperial power of the Emperor declined. Edicts of Emperor Theodosius II and Valentinian III proclaimed the Roman bishop \\"as Rector of the whole Church.\\" The Emperor Justinian, who was living in the East in Constantinople, in the 6th century published a similar decree. These proclamations did not create the office of the pope but from the 6th century onward the Bishop of Rome's power and prestige increased so dramatically that the title of \\"pope\\" (Gk: pappas, \\"father\\") began to fit the Bishop of Rome best.D'Aubigne, Book I, p. 81. =First Council of Constantinople= Early manuscript illustration of Council of Constantinople The event that is often considered to have been the first conflict between Rome and Constantinople was triggered by the elevation of the see of Constantinople to a position of honour second only to Rome, on the grounds that as capital of the eastern Roman empire it was now the \\"New Rome\\". This was promulgated in the First Council of Constantinople (381) canon 3 which decreed: \\"The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of honour after the Bishop of Rome because Constantinople is the New Rome.\\" At the Council of Rome, a synod held in the following year, 382, Pope Damasus I protested against this raising of the bishop of the new imperial capital, just fifty years old, to a status higher than that of the bishops of Alexandria and Antioch. In opposition to this view, Francis Dvornik asserts that not only did Damasus offer \\"no protest against the elevation of Constantinople\\", that change in the primacy of the major sees was effected in an \\"altogether friendly atmosphere\\". According to Dvornik, \\"Everyone continued to regard the Bishop of Rome as the first bishop of the Empire, and the head of the church.\\" Thomas Shahan says that, according to Photius, Pope Damasus approved the council of Constantinople, but he adds that, if any part of the council were approved by this pope, it could have been only its revision of the Nicene Creed, as was the case also when Gregory the Great recognized it as one of the four general councils, but only in its dogmatic utterances. The first documented use of the description of Saint Peter as first bishop of Rome, rather than as the apostle who commissioned its first bishop, dates from 354, and the phrase \\"the Apostolic See\\", which refers to the same apostle, began to be used exclusively of the see of Rome, a usage found also in the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon. From the time of Pope Damasus I, the text of (\\"You are Peter and on this rock I will build my church\\") is used to support Roman primacy. Pope Innocent I (401‚Äì417) claimed that all major cases should be reserved to the see of Rome and wrote: \\"All must preserve that which Peter the prince of the apostles delivered to the church at Rome and which it has watched over until now, and nothing may be added or introduced that lacks this authority or that derives its pattern from somewhere else.\\" Pope Boniface I (418‚Äì422) stated that the church of Rome stood to the churches throughout the world \\"as the head to the members\\", a statement that was repeated by the delegates of Pope Leo I to the Council of Chalcedon in 451. =Relationship with bishops of other cities= The increasing involvement of Eastern emperors in church matters and the advancement of the see of Constantinople over the sees of Antioch, Alexandria and Jerusalem led successive bishops of Rome to attempt a sharper definition of their ecclesial position vis-a-vis the other bishops. Rome was not the only city that could claim a special role in Christ's Church. Jerusalem had the prestige of being the city of Christ's death and resurrection, the location of the first church and an important church council of the 1st century. Antioch was the place where Jesus' followers were first called \\"Christians\\" {7} (as well as \\"Catholic\\") and, with Alexandria, was an important early center of Christian thought. It is important to note, however, that the three main apostolic sees of the early Church (i.e. Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome) claimed an origin related to Peter, hence the term Petrine Sees. Prior to holding the position of Bishop of Rome, Peter was the Bishop of Antioch. And his disciple, St. Mark the Evangelist, founded the church in Alexandria. Constantinople became highly important after Constantine moved his capital there in 330 AD. It was not until 440 that Leo the Great more clearly articulated the extension of papal authority as doctrine, promulgating in edicts and in councils his right to exert \\"the full range of apostolic powers that Jesus had first bestowed on the apostle Peter\\". It was at the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 that Leo I (through his emissaries) stated that he was \\"speaking with the voice of Peter\\". At this same Council, an attempt at compromise was made when the bishop of Constantinople was given a primacy of honour only second to that of the Bishop of Rome, because \\"Constantinople is the New Rome\\". Ironically, Roman papal authorities rejected this language since it did not clearly recognize Rome's claim to juridical authority over the other churches.La Due, William J., \\"The Chair of Saint Peter\\", pp.300-301, Orbis Books (Maryknoll, NY; 1999) =Leo I= In line with the norm of Roman law that a person's legal rights and duties passed to his heir, Pope Leo (440‚Äì461) taught that he, as Peter's representative, succeeded to the power and authority of Peter, and he implied that it was through Peter that the other apostles received from Christ strength and stability. Pope Gelasius I (492‚Äì496) stated: \\"The see of blessed Peter the Apostle has the right to unbind what has been bound by sentences of any pontiffs whatever, in that it has the right to judge the whole church. Neither is it lawful for anyone to judge its judgment, seeing that canons have willed that it might be appealed to from any part of the world, but that no one may be allowed to appeal from it.\\" The Catholic Church doctrine of the sedes apostolica (apostolic see) states that every bishop of Rome, as Peter's successor, possesses the full authority granted to this position, so that this power is inviolable on the grounds that it was established by God himself and not bound to any individual. Leo I (440-461), with the aid of Roman law, solidified this doctrine by making the bishop of Rome the legal heir of Peter. According to Leo, the apostle Peter continued to speak to the Christian community through his successors as bishop of Rome.  East‚ÄìWest Schism  The dispute about the authority of Roman bishops reached a climax in the year 1054 when Michael I Cerularius tried to bolster his position as the Patriarch of Constantinople, seeming to set himself up as a rival of Pope Leo IX, as the popes previously had forbidden calling Constantinople a patriarchate. The dispute ended when the pope's legate excommunicated Michael I Cerularius and, in exchange, he excommunicated the pope‚Äîwho by then was already dead, due to sickness. This event resulted the separation of the Churches.Thompson, Ernest T. (1965). Through The Ages: A History Of The Christian Church. The CLC Press. Factors furthering the east‚Äìwest split included the Western adoption of the filioque with the Roman Church's unilateral acceptance of it without approval of an Ecumenical council, and the pope's usage of a forged document, the so- called Donation of Constantine, to support his authority against the Eastern Churches. Second Council of Lyons The Second Council of Lyon was convoked to act on a pledge by Byzantine emperor Michael VIII to reunite the Eastern church with the West.Wetterau, Bruce. World history. New York: Henry Holt and company. 1994. Wishing to end the Great Schism that divided Rome and Constantinople, Gregory X had sent an embassy to Michael VIII Palaeologus, who had reconquered Constantinople. Michael VIII had put an end to the remnants of the Latin Empire in the East and had asked Latin despots in the East to curb their ambitions. On 29 June (Feast of Peter & Paul patronal feast of popes), Gregory X celebrated a Mass in St John's Church, where both sides took part. The council declared that the Roman church possessed ‚Äúthe supreme and full primacy and authority over the universal Catholic Church.‚Äù The council was seemingly a success, but did not provide a lasting solution to the schism; the Emperor was anxious to heal the schism, but the Eastern clergy proved to be obstinate. Patriarch Joseph of Constantinople abdicated and was replaced by John Bekkos, a convert to the cause of union. In spite of a sustained campaign by Bekkos to defend the union intellectually, and vigorous and brutal repression of opponents by Michael VIII, the vast majority of Byzantine Christians remained implacably opposed to union with the Latin \\"heretics\\". Michael's death in December 1282 put an end to the union of Lyons. His son and successor Andronicus II repudiated the union and Bekkos was forced to abdicate, being eventually exiled and imprisoned until his death in 1297. He is to this day reviled by many in the Eastern Church as a traitor to Orthodoxy. Reformation The primacy of the Roman Pontiff was again challenged in 1517 when Martin Luther began preaching against several practices in the Catholic Church, including abuses involving indulgences. When Pope Leo X refused to support Luther's position, Luther proposed an \\"invisible church\\" (that is, a group including Christians who did not belong in a visible way to the Roman Catholic Church) and eventually called the pope the Antichrist. Luther's rejection of the primacy of the Roman Pontiff led to the start of the Protestant Reformation, during which numerous persons in Europe broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and formed various other Christian denominations. The Catholic Church in England, by act of Parliament, also legally broke away from the Roman Catholic Church at this time, for political and marital reasons and appealing to theological principles. Christianity had been in England since the Roman military occupation, originally predating claims of primacy of the bishop of Rome that centuries later had come to be accepted in England. King Henry VIII and his parliaments rejected tout court the juridical primacy of the bishop of Rome and his papal successors in favour of a royal supremacy, which reached its final refinement during the reign of his daughter Elizabeth I. First Vatican Council The doctrine of papal primacy was further developed in 1870 at the First Vatican Council where ultramontanism achieved victory over conciliarism with the pronouncement of papal infallibility (the ability of the pope to define dogmas free from error ex cathedra) and of papal supremacy, i.e., supreme, full, immediate, and universal ordinary jurisdiction of the pope. The most substantial body of defined doctrine on the subject is found in Pastor aeternus, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church of Christ of Vatican Council I. This document declares that \\"in the disposition of God the Roman church holds the preeminence of ordinary power over all the other churches\\". This council also affirmed the dogma of papal infallibility, deciding that the ‚Äúinfallibility‚Äù of the Christian community extended to the pope himself, when he appeals to his highest authority in defining matters of faith. Vatican I defined a twofold primacy of Peter‚Äîone in papal teaching on faith and morals (the charism of infallibility), and the other a primacy of jurisdiction involving government and discipline of the Church‚Äîsubmission to both being necessary to Catholic faith. Vatican I rejected the ideas that papal decrees have \\"no force or value unless confirmed by an order of the secular power\\" and that the pope's decisions can be appealed to an ecumenical council \\"as to an authority higher than the Roman Pontiff.\\" Paul Collins argues that \\"(the doctrine of papal primacy as formulated by the First Vatican Council) has led to the exercise of untrammelled papal power and has become a major stumbling block in ecumenical relationships with the Orthodox (who consider the definition to be heresy) and Protestants.\\" Forced to break off prematurely by secular political developments in 1870, Vatican I left behind it a somewhat unbalanced ecclesiology. \\"In theology the question of papal primacy was so much in the foreground that the Church appeared essentially as a centrally directed institution which one was dogged in defending but which only encountered one externally,\\"Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger It adjourned abruptly, without time to consider matters such as the relationship of the bishops and the faithful to Jesus' promise that \\"the gates of hades will not prevail against it [the church]\\" (Mt 16:18). Second Vatican Council At the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965) the debate on papal primacy and authority re-emerged, and in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (Lumen gentium) the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on the authority of the pope, bishops and councils was further elaborated. Vatican II sought to correct the unbalanced ecclesiology left behind by Vatican I. Vatican II reaffirmed everything Vatican I taught about papal primacy and infallibility but it added important points about bishops. Bishops, it says, are not \\"vicars of the Roman Pontiff\\". Rather, in governing their local churches they are \\"vicars and legates of Christ\\".cf. Catechism, nos. 894-95 Together they form a body, a \\"college\\", whose head is the pope. This episcopal college is responsible for the well-being of the universal Church. Here in a nutshell are the basic elements of the Council's much-discussed communio ecclesiology, which affirms the importance of local churches and the doctrine of collegiality. In a key passage about collegiality, Vatican II teaches: \\"The order of bishops is the successor to the college of the apostles in their role as teachers and pastors, and in it the apostolic college is perpetuated. Together with their head, the Supreme Pontiff, and never apart from him, they have supreme and full authority over the Universal Church; but this power cannot be exercised without the agreement of the Roman Pontiff\\".Lumen gentium, 22 Much of the present discussion of papal primacy is concerned with exploring the implications of this passage. Chapter 3 of the dogmatic constitution on the Church of Vatican Council I (Pastor aeternus) is the principal document of the magisterium about the content and nature of the primatial power of the Roman Pontiff. Chapter 4 is a development and defining of one particular characteristic of this primatial power, namely the pope's supreme teaching authority, i.e. when the pope speaks ex cathedra a he teaches the doctrine of the faith infallibly. There is general agreement that the pope has only twice exercised his authority to proclaim a dogma apart from an ecumenical council, in the case of the Immaculate Conception (1854) and of Mary's Assumption (1950). Popes Pius IX and Pius XII both consulted with the bishops around the world before pronouncing that these beliefs were infallibly held by Catholics.

Due to habitat destruction, many populations have recently been lost across its European range, so, the species is considered endangered in the United Kingdom and in several European countries. In captivity they commonly grow up to ; in the wild they can achieve sizes of . In the UK, there are just two known populations: in a pool and adjacent area in the Caerlaverock Wetlands in Scotland, and a temporary pond in the New Forest. The species is legally protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). This species is considered to be one of the oldest living species on the planet at around 200 million years old. Fossils of this species from the Upper Triassic (Norian) period appear virtually unchanged compared to modern day members of the species.Klaus-Peter Kelber - Triops Life cycle Triops cancriformis has a very fast life cycle, and individuals become mature in about two weeks after hatching. Their populations can be gonochoric, hermaphroditic or androdioecious. The latter is a very rare reproductive mode in animals, in which populations are made of hermaphrodites, with a small proportion of males. Due to this lack of males, early researchers thought Triops were parthenogenetic. The presence of testicular lobes scattered amongst their ovaries confirmed they were in fact hermaphroditic. Fertilized females or hermaphrodites produce diapausing eggs or cysts, able to survive decades in the sediment of the ponds and lakes they inhabit. These eggs are resistant to drought and temperature extremes. Taxonomic history In 1801, Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc made the first officially recognised species description of Triops cancriformis. He named this species Apus cancriformis. Other authors used the name Apus cancriformis over the years but often with the wrong original author of this name. The genus name Apus was pre-occupied by a genus of birds (described in 1777), rendering the name invalid for the tadpole shrimp. In 1909, Ludwig Keilhack used the correct name \\"Triops cancriformis (Bosc)\\" in a field identification key of the freshwater fauna of Germany. He took up the genus name proposed by Schrank and suggested that the genus name Apus be replaced with Triops Schrank since Apus had been used since 1777 as the genus name of some birds (commonly known as swifts). However, other authors disagreed with him and the controversy continued until the 1950s. In 1955, Alan Longhurst provided the original author of T. cancriformis as \\"Triops cancriformis (Bosc, 1801)\\" with a full history of synonymy to support it. This was in a taxonomic review of the Notostraca that also supported using the genus name Triops instead of Apus. In 1958, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) recognised the name Triops cancriformis (Bosc, 1801‚Äì1802) (ICZN name no. 1476) as officially the oldest. They also recognised the genus name Triops Schrank instead of Apus. They followed Longhurst in these decisions. Human uses Triops cancriformis Beni-Kabuto Ebi Albino feeding on a piece of rehydrated dried shrimp, ultra closeup showing how transparent the carapace is. Although members of the genus Triops usually have no economic importance, the Beni-kabuto ebi albino variant of Triops cancriformis has been used to control mosquitoes and weeds in Asian rice fields. Triops cancriformis is the second most common species raised by hobbyists next to Triops longicaudatus. They are particularly valued for their lower hatching temperature and somewhat longer lifespan as well as potentially larger size.

The genus is noted for several distinct skeletal features. The skull possesses deeply pocketed fossa in a notably long preorbital region. The genus is considered an example of phyletic dwarfism with adults estimated at being on average 20kg in weight. This is in contrast to the most common equid of the period, Miohippus. Characters of the teeth show a mix of both primitive and advanced traits. The advanced traits are very similar to those shown in the genus Parahippus. The noted similarities of Archaeohippus and Parahippus show them to be descended from a common ancestor and are considered sister species. Taxonomic history The first species to be named was found in the Miocene Mascall Fauna of Cottonwood Creek, Oregon. Named Anchitherium ultimus the species was described in 1886 by noted paleontologist, E. D. Cope during the height of the Bone wars. During study 1906 on the Mascall formation equids, J. Gidley moved to a new genus he named Archaeohippus. The strong similarity of the traits resulted in the genus being considered a subgenus of Parahippus by W. D. Matthew in 1932. In stark contrast of opinion Archaeohippus was revalidated by D.F. Bode in 1933, and along with A. ultimus, he included A. mourningi and A. penultimus. Archaeohippus ranged across all of North America. In addition to the occurrences in Florida and Oregon, fossil specimens have been found in Southern Saskatchewan, Canada. & 1993 \\"Biostratigraphy of the Cypress Hills Formation (Eocene to Miocene), Saskatchewan: equid types (Mammalia: Perissodactyla) and associated faunal assemblages.\\" Journal of Paleontology 67:660‚Äì669.

He had a brother, William Hugh Croskery. Croskery arrived in New Zealand with his parents in 1880. He attended Queen's College in Auckland, before working on a farm in Taranaki from 1894‚Äì1895. He then moved to Wellington, and in 1896 began work as a draper's assistant at James Smith and Sons. He married Emily Clark on 17 December 1902; they were to have ten daughters and three sons. The family lived in Newtown, where between 1902 and 1911 Croskery ran his own drapery and tailoring business in Riddiford Street, then about 1917 moved to Lyall Bay. Croskery helped to found the Wellington Retail Soft-goods Employees' Union in February, 1912, and served as its secretary. He also served as Secretary of the Wellington Butchers' Union, Secretary of the NZ Shop Assistants' Federation, and the Wellington Plumbers' and Gasfitters' Union, from their foundation until his death in 1952. Croskery worked hard to increase the union's membership, particularly in provincial areas outside Wellington, and supported the incorporation of all shop employees into one union. A capable administrator and advocate, he was a model arbitrationist union secretary. He had a meticulous approach to clerical and financial matters and invested union funds shrewdly. From 1913, Croskery was closely involved with the Wellington Trades and Labour Council and its successor, the Wellington Trades Council, serving as an executive member from 1936 and as vice president from 1939 to 1945. He was also active in the political wing of the labour movement. He stood unsuccessfully for the Wellington City Council on several occasions, and contested the Wellington Suburbs electorate for the New Zealand Labour Party in the 1919 and 1922 general elections. He was a member of the Labour Party's national executive in 1937‚Äì38 and 1939‚Äì40, but he always put the interests of his union's members first. In the 1930s, Croskery emerged as a significant figure in the national labour movement. In 1936 he became secretary of the New Zealand Alliance of Labour, and the following year he played an important role in unifying the various factions to form the New Zealand Federation of Labour (FOL). He served on the Wellington Hospital Board from 1935‚Äì1941, and as a workers' representative on the Court of Arbitration from 1937‚Äì1938. He later served on the Industrial Emergency Council and the Workers' Compensation Board. He became a member of the FOL's executive in 1942 and its vice president in 1943. In 1946, Croskery was elected President of the Federation of Labour, succeeding Angus McLagan; he held office until his death in 1952. He served as FOL President during a time of difficulty for the labour movement, including the formation of the rival New Zealand Trade Union Congress in 1950, the bitter 1951 waterfront dispute, and political opposition from a resurgent National Party. However, colleagues recalled his calm, steadying influence; mediation rather than confrontation was his style. He worked well with FOL Vice-President Fintan Patrick Walsh, and was an exemplary representative for the New Zealand labour movement overseas, serving as a delegate to the World Trade Union Conferences in London in 1945 and in Paris in 1949, as well as to the International Labour Organization's conference in Geneva in 1949. A dapper, well-dressed man who was always smoking a pipe, Croskery suffered from chronic bronchitis and emphysema in later years. He died in Wellington on 18 August 1952; Emily had died a year earlier. They were survived by nine daughters and two sons.

It is located at the bank of the River Vaigai, which flows in the direction North to South here in Thiruvedagam. Here a famous and historical Shiva temple named Edaganathar temple is located.http://temple.dinamalar.com/news_detail.php?id=2165 Legendary history of the village Thiruvedagam village which was occupied by the Samanars, changed the course of history. The Pandya King Arikesari Nedumaran who belonged to the Saivaite faith, due to the clever tactics of the Samanar community, underwent a conversion. He deviated from the path of virtue and his subjects also followed their ruler. The Saivaite queen sent an emissary to Gnana Sambandhar and requested him to save the king and the subjects from the Samanar's grip. Acceding to her request, Sambandhar with the blessings of Appar, paid a visit to Madurai. Stirred and worried by his visit, the Samanars burnt the monastery of Sambandhar and this reflected on the King, who was afflicted with leprosy. Both the Samanars and Sambandhar treated the disease. The Samanars efforts proved futile while the sacred ash given by Sambandhar to the King cured him. Angered by this, the Samanars challenged Sambandhar to 'anall vaadham' (hot dispute) and 'punall vaadham' (cold dispute). Defeated by Sambandhar in the anall vaadham, they got down to punall vaadham. The Samanars wrote ' Athi Naathi' on a palmyra leaf and floated it down the river Vaigai, while Sambandhar wrote in Tamil: '‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ¥‡Øç‡Æï ‡ÆÖ‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ£‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡ÆÜ‡Æ©‡Æø‡Æ©‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æµ‡ØÄ‡Æ¥‡Øç‡Æï ‡Æ§‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ©‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Øá‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ©‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æì‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æï ‡ÆÜ‡Æ¥‡Øç‡Æï ‡Æ§‡ØÄ‡ÆØ‡Æ§‡ØÜ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡ÆÖ‡Æ∞‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡ÆÆ‡Øá ‡Æö‡ØÇ‡Æ¥‡Øç‡Æï ‡Æµ‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Æï ‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡ØÅ‡ÆØ‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æ§‡ØÄ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æï‡Æµ‡Øá' and floated it down the Vaigai. The palmyra leaf that Sambandhar floated reached the bank on the other side where there lies an idol of Lord Ganesha who is known as \\" vaathu venra vinayakar \\" .. Sambandhar feeling happy called the place as 'Edu Senranai Tharum Edagam' which came to be known as Thiruvedagam. The palmyra leaf which the Samanars left was swept away by the river and reached 'Thirupasethi'( thiru + pa + serthal) later to be known as thirupachetty. The Vaigai River flows in the direction North to South here in Thiruvedagam. So it is said to be as good as praying in Kashi. A Shiva temple known as \\"Edaganathan Temple\\" is situated in the middle of the village.It is the second most important Lord Shiva temple in madurai district.More than 60% agricultural land of the village owned by temple.

She is the Ambassador of Afghanistan to Norway. She is a recipient of the International Editor of the Year Award. Early life She was born in 1970 in Kabul, Afghanistan. \\"Barakzai\\" is a common name among the Pashtun, one of the country's main ethnic groups, and was shared by its rulers from the 1830s until the overthrow of the last king. She speaks both of Afghanistan's official languages, Pashto and Dari, as well as English. Her paternal grandfather was a chef while her maternal grandfather was a senator during the times of King Zahir Khan. Barakzai went to Kabul University in the 1990s. Halfway through a degree, she had to break off her studies because of mounting violence between the government and the Mujahideen. In September 1996 the Taliban captured Kabul. By then, many citizens, especially the educated middle classes, had left for a life in exile. Campaigning journalism Following the fall of the Taliban regime, Barakzai capitalized on the opportunity and in 2002 Barakzai founded Aina-E-Zan (Women‚Äôs Mirror), a national weekly newspaper. She campaigns on issues such as maternal and infant mortality, areas in which Afghanistan has great difficulty.\\"Afghan Editor Works to Rebuild Country\\" 30 July 2005 Women's E-News (The World Health Organization (WHO) calculated that Afghanistan in 2003 had the world's highest proportion of women dying in childbirth (Maternal Mortality Ratio) at 1900 per 100 000 live births.) Barakzai states, \\"Child marriage, forced marriage, and violence against women are still common and accepted practices.\\" She focuses on large issues, saying, \\"in my opinion the burka is not that important. What is important is education, democracy and freedom.\\" She stresses unity among women as well as the role that men have to play. Barakzai credits technology such as mobile phones, banned under the Taliban regime, with helping young Afghans integrate with the modern world. For example, using text messaging to vote for a participant in a television talent show contest demonstrates how democratic voting can work. She also uses her position to point out the lack of freedom of the press and the risks to journalists. (Reporters Without Borders ranks Afghanistan 156 out of 173 in its list of press freedom, and says the situation is especially difficult for women and those working in the provinces.Reporters Without Borders World Report 2009: Afghanistan) Move into politics U.S. Congress and Afghan Parliamentarians at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. Barakzai was appointed a member of the 2003 loya jirga, a body of representatives from all over Afghanistan that was nominated to discuss and pass the new constitution after the fall of the Taliban. In the October 2004 elections she was elected as a member of the House of the People or Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of the National Assembly of Afghanistan. She is one of 71 women out of 249 MPs. She is one of only a handful of female MPs who speak up for women's rights, and faces death threats for her views. Her criticisms of the legislature are wide-ranging: \\"Our parliament is a collection of lords. Warlords, drug lords, crime lords.\\" She defended Malalai Joya, another female MP who has condemned warlordism, who faced abuse and threats of violence in parliament: \\"I was I think the only one which is I just announced that some MPs were threatening to rape her. [...] That's why after this, they kept quiet.\\" In November 2014 she was injured in a suicide attack on a convoy in which she was travelling in Kabul. The attack killed three people and injured 17. Views While expressing gratitude for \\"the support of the international community\\" in creating the conditions by 2004 in which hundreds of publications and dozens of radio stations could flourish, Barakzai condemns \\"the support of armed groups and outlaws, a key part of U.S. policy\\". Although most of her life has been spent in Kabul, she acknowledges that the capital does not truly represent the country, and refuses to blame the Taliban for all the difficulties that Afghans face: \\"When we talk about Afghanistan, we should discuss conditions in the entire country. In many provinces and villages, which are in very bad condition, there is no difference between the period before the Taliban regime, the time of the Taliban, and now.\\" She opposes U.S. President Barack Obama's troop build-up plan, asking for \\"30,000 scholars or engineers\\" instead of that many soldiers. She intended to stand for President of Afghanistan in 2014,\\"Successful Afghan politician still victim of tradition\\", 8 March 2009 Taipei Times as by then she will be over 40, as the constitution requires, but did not run.

History  In the 1990s, the banned terror outfit United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) was extremely active in Assam, and had been extorting money from tea companies to fund its activities. That most companies were paying up in fear was a well known fact.Is Tata Tea Being Witch-Hunted? But Tata Tea never did, and this was confirmed by ULFA Commander-in-Chief Paresh Baruah in an interview published by Rediff.com, though according to Baruah, they did pay a ransom of 10 million in 1993 to secure the release of their regional manager Bolin Bordoloi from the clutches of another banned terror outfit, National Democratic Front of Bodoland, something that Tata Tea executive director S. M. Kidwai denied. During 1997, the ULFA and Bodo militants were involved in many terror attacks and other militant activities, the biggest ones being the failed assassination attempt by ULFA on Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, head of the government of Assam formed by the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) party, and the murder of social activist Sanjay Ghose by ULFA. And this last incident received wide publicity and focused attention on the deteriorating law and order condition in Assam, threatening the very survival of the Mahanta government; his previous government had been dismissed in 1990 in similar circumstances. Before the assembly elections that brought the AGP back to power, Mahanta had visited Calcutta to raise funds for his party, and the tea companies had not responded well to the demand; Tata Tea in particular had refused to pay.  Pranati Deka's arrest  On 23 August 1997, Pranati Deka, central committee member and cultural secretary of ULFA was arrested with her baby at Mumbai's Santa Cruz airport along with two accomplices. A visiting card belonging to a senior Tata Tea executive was recovered from one of the accomplices.Assam police arrest Tata Tea GM Dogra for nexus with ULFA According to the police, Brojen Gogoi, a senior manager with the Community Development and Social Welfare wing of the company, had accompanied Deka to Mumbai for child-birth, and the cost of medical treatment and lodging ‚Äì amounting to INR 50,000 was paid by Tata Tea. The company said that it was not aware of Deka's identity, something Baruah confirms, and that the expenses were borne under a special medical aid scheme they had initiated in 1997 for the people of Assam. The Assam police interrogated Tata Tea executives SS Dogra (general manager), SN Kidwai (executive director), and Krishna Kumar (managing director), and arrested Dogra \\"for aiding and abetting unlawful activities of the banned organisation ULFA and knowingly conniving with those who are waging a war against the state.\\" Since Gogoi had accompanied Deka, the police were also looking for him. Gogoi had been to Harvard on a study trip and checked into a company guest house in Calcutta after returning to India on 6 September, when he came to know that he was wanted by the police, and on 11 September, shifted to Hotel Rutt Deen, where he registered under his own name. A couple of days later, Tata Tea officials became aware of an Interpol alert issued for Gogoi.Tata Tea officials probed on alleged nexus with ULFA On 15 September, Tata group head Ratan Tata, and Tata Tea head Krishna Kumar met Chief Minister Mahanta in Delhi, and told him that Gogoi was abroad.Assam govt concerned at harbouring of Gogoi Noted criminal lawyer Ram Jethmalani wrote a letter to Mahanta confirming the same- {{cquote\\"It is true that the Managing Director Krishna Kumar and Ratan Tata, the Chairman, saw you on 15th September at Assam House (in New Delhi). They were told that Dr Brojen Gogoi was required by the police. But your Chief Secretary [V.S. Jafa] kept saying that he knew what Gogoi was doing in Chicago. Now, Gogoi had gone to Harvard for a training course which ended in August and was on leave up to 15th September. He had not reported for duty and your visitors did not know on that day that Gogoi had already arrived in India. Even if they had some inkling, they would not dare contradict your Chief Secretary who affirmed that he was in the US (and that) Interpol was after him and he would be arrested the moment he lands in India. They made no false statement to you. They stated what they honestly believed at that time. It is their subsequent discovery that Dr Gogoi was already in India and had used their guest house which was entitled to do without reporting to anyone.\\" On 16 September, Gogoi admitted himself into the Woodland's Nursing Home in Calcutta, and contacted Tata Tea on the 18th. He surrendered to the police on the 24th. The \\"Tata Tapes\\" The tapes that Ritu Sarin accessed contained conversations between Nusli Wadia and many political and industrial heavyweights, and showed that the Tatas were trying to get the central government to intervene in their problems with the Assam Government. Mahanta had met the Indian Prime Minister I. K. Gujral and had complained to him about the Union Home Secretary K. Padmanabhaiah's interference in the matter. The tapes also seemed to suggest that the Tatas knew Gogoi's whereabouts (he had stayed at the company guest house before moving to a hotel and then a nursing home) and had lied to the Assam government about not knowing his location. But that was denied by the group as also Ram Jethmalani. The identity of the persons involved in tapping Wadia's telephones remained a mystery. The Central government denied it had anything to do with it ‚Äì the Intelligence Bureau works under the Home Secretary ‚Äì Padmanabhaiah. He demanded a probe into the illegal phone tapping and said in a telephonic interview to the Indian Express- And the Indian government ordered a probe into the matter. Aftermath The United Front government at the centre collapsed in November 1997, and Mahanta made peace with the tea industry but lost the state elections in 1998.

June 7, 1920 ‚Äì July 19, 2016) was an Argentine playwright, theatre director, and novelist. His seminal work El puente debuted in 1949 and he garnered numerous awards for his proceeding works. He later was Secretary of Culture between 1983-86. Early life Carlos Gorostiza Rodr√≠guez was born to Basque Argentine parents in the upscale Buenos Aires borough of Palermo. He and an older brother enjoyed a happy early childhood until, in 1926, their father, Ferm√≠n Gorostiza (among the first Argentines to receive a pilot's licence) abandoned the family. His mother took up employment with a clothing designer, and her two sons, who entered the labour force as children, gradually recovered from the setback. In 1931, she remarried and had a daughter, Mar√≠a Esther, who went on to become a moderately successful actress under the pseudonym Anal√≠a Gad√©. Career Gorostiza's Spanish-born stepfather, a playwright, introduced Carlos to the theatre. In 1943, he debuted his first work, a puppet show, La clave encantada (The enchanted key). The show's success allowed him to open a puppet theatre, La Estrella Grande. He began frequenting the M√°scara Theatre, where he began a successful run as Creon in their productions of the classic Greek tragedy, Antigone. Encouraged by friends, he presented his first play at the M√°scara Theatre in 1949, El puente (The Bridge). Capturing the tension between different social classes in Buenos Aires, the realist El puente drew partly on his own childhood experiences with his mother's fallen social status and secured his reputation in Buenos Aires. Produced in a professional version by director Armando Disc√©polo at the prestigious Argentine Theatre, El puente was adapted into a film version, which Gorostiza directed in 1950.\\"Carlos Gorostiza y otro cruce del puente\\", Clar√≠n, 29 June 1998; retrieved 19 July 2016. Following El puente success, Gorostiza returned to theatre direction, though without the draw of spectators he had earlier enjoyed. Turning to work as a publicist for an ad agency whose chief customer was a laundry soap maker, his fame returned somewhat as a screenwriter for Julio Saraceni's drama Marta Ferrari (1954) and when his play El pan de la locura (The bread of madness) was produced at Buenos Aires' famed Cervantes Theatre to acclaim in 1958. The tragedy won him the coveted Municipal Prize, an award that earned him an invitation to the Central University of Venezuela Drama School in 1960, where he taught and co- wrote Los Caobos (The mahogany trees) with Juana Sujo. Returning to Argentina in 1964, he continued his academic experience as professor of drama at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1966, he writes and stages the play The neighbors, based on the Kitty Genovese murder from the perspective of the inactive spectators of the near buildings. Devoting himself mostly to teaching, Gorostiza produced only two new plays in the next decade. A novel published early in 1976 (Los cuartos oscuros ‚Äì The voting booths) yielded him a National Grand Prize for Literature. This, his first novel, coincided with the military coup that would usher in the most brutal Argentine dictatorship of the 20th century; shortly thereafter, Gorostiza lost his tenure at the University of Buenos Aires. Cautious but undeterred, Gorostiza published a second novel, Los hermanos queridos (Dear brothers), in 1978. A subtle criticism of the era's climate of fear, it earned him another Municipal Grand Prize and National Grand Prize. A certain loosening of censorship in 1980 led his fellow playwright Osvaldo Drag√∫n to form a partnership with Gorostiza, writer Roberto Cossa, actor Pepe Soriano and others in an Argentine Open Theatre in the hope of encouraging a further return of the freedom of expression whose absence had led so many other cultural figures to leave Argentina since 1975. Converting a shuttered spark plug factory in the Balvanera district of Buenos Aires to the Picadero Theatre, they premiered a festival of their collective new works (including Gorostiza's El acompa√±amiento ‚Äì The entourage) to acclaim on July 28, 1981. This success was marred by the theatre's fire bombing a week later, still an \\"unsolved mystery\\" (the Picadero reopened in 2001).Teatro Abierto. Teatro del Pueblo. Retrieved 19 July 2016. The return to democracy imminently following the Falklands War and economic collapse at the hand of the dictators' economists, Gorostiza produced Killing Time and A Fire to Put Out in 1982, plays which earned him an Argentores Prize. Foray into politics Elections called for October 1983 drew Gorostiza to a progressive UCR candidate, Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n. Facing a close contest with Peronist candidate √çtalo L√∫der and with elections but three months away, the UCR nominee was given a simple slogan by the former publicist: the alliterative Ahora, Alfons√≠n! Facing a harried timetable and with his candidate unable to break out in the polls, Gorostiza was struck by President Reynaldo Bignone's snide dismissal of the historic elections as a \\"democratic way out,\\" whereby he created ads appealing for votes for \\"more than a democratic way out...a way into life.\\" Alfons√≠n won the 1983 election by a surprising 12-point margin, carrying majorities in Lower House of Congress.Ginzburg, Victoria (30 October 2008).

Appointed Secretary of Culture by President Alfons√≠n upon taking office on December 10, he rescinded the National Film Rating Entity and devoted his time to the post, helping encourage a strong recovery in the theatre and cinema of Argentina amid continuing economic malaise and budgetary scarcity. Frustrated by the post's limitations, he resigned amicably in 1986. He was replaced by Marcos Aguinis. Later work Gorostiza returned to writing, publishing a novella, collaborating on an acclaimed 1989 documentary of the Open Theatre and penning a nostalgic look at his brief time with his barnstorming natural father, Aeroplanos, which won him another Argentores Prize. Turning increasingly to the past, his sentimental 1994 play Rear Patio and 1999 historical novel Vuelan las Palomas (Pigeons fly) were less-well received, though Gorostiza retained his loyal following. His existentialist 2001 novel Good People was followed in 2004 by another tale of his own childhood curiosity, The Masked Marauder. Gorostiza debuted his long-awaited El alma de pap√° (Dad's soul) in 2008.

The caterpillar would usually rest on the undersurface of the leaves that it's feeding on. The adult is a diurnal flying moth with a black wingspan of up to 5 cm having white bands on the forewings and a white outer margin on the hind wings. The abdomen is black on the top with orange bands below. The body features clumps of bright red hair on the end of the abdomen, and at the legs base. These red hairs protrude and are visible from atop. The adult males have anterior brush organs which exude pheromones. The adults are social, feeding on nectar and would live for around 2-3 weeks. The moth can ascend as high as 25 meters or more. Distribution It is endemic to the south-eastern half of Australia, but is an invasive species in many parts of the world, including New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. Diet The larvae mainly feed on Parthenocissus quinquefolia, Hibbertia obtusifolia, Amyema gaudichaudii, Epilobium ciliatum, Fuchsia and Oenothera species, but mainly Vitis vinifera, hence it is considered an agricultural pest. Pest control The Indian myna (Acridotheres tristis) was introduced into Australia in 1862 to deal with a number of insect pests including the grapevine moth. In this it was unsuccessful, and ironically the bird is now itself considered a pest in many parts of Australia.

He heads the architectural practice based in Rotterdam with offices in Moscow, Budapest and Prague. He is best known for his projects of ING Group Headquarters in Budapest, Drents Museum in Assen, The Rock tower in Amsterdam, Incineration line in Roskilde, Main building and Auditorium in Leipzig University and the Corporate University of Sberbank in Moscow. He is the winner of RIBA Award 2007, Best Building Award 2011&2012 and European Property Award 2013. April 26, 2016, Erick van Egeraat was decorated ‚ÄòOfficer in the order of Oranje Nassau.' This decoration was presented to Erick van Egeraat by the Mayor of Rotterdam, on behalf of the King of the Netherlands. Early career Erick van Egeraat graduated from the Delft University of Technology, Department of Architecture. During his last year in the university, after winning the competition to design flexible youth housing at Kruisplein, Rotterdam he co-founded Mecanoo with Henk D√∂ll, Francine Houben, Roelf Steenhuis and Chris de Weijer. The early years of Mecanoo were characterized by projects which challenged the norms of urban renewal and social housing.Egeraat, E. van & Sudjic D. Six ideas about architecture. Birkh√§user: Basel, 1997, p.9 Notable projects include Housing Kruisplein, Rotterdam (1980-1985), Bilderberg Parkhotel, Rotterdam (1990-1992), House 13 at the IGA Stuttgart 1993 (1990-1993), Faculty of Economics and Management, Utrecht (1991-1995) and the Library at Delft University of Technology (1992-1998). Later career In 1995 Erick van Egeraat left Mecanoo and established his own company Erick van Egeraat associated architects (EEA) with offices in Rotterdam, London, Budapest, Prague and Moscow. A milestone project which expressed his new architectural approach was the Headquarters of ING Bank and NNH Insurance company in Budapest (1992-1994). In his own words, ‚ÄúIt may be considered one of the first buildings to juxtapose an uncompromising modernism with intuitive organic shapes to achieve what might be called Modern Baroque‚Äù. The new vision found its articulation in a variety of projects, such as Crawford Art Gallery in Cork, Ireland (1996-2000), Pop-stage Mezz in Breda, the Netherlands (1996-2002), Mauritskade building in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1996-2002), City Hall in Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands (1997-2002) and Visual Art Center in Middlesbrough, England (2007) for which the architect received the RIBA award. This period was marked by a greater diversity of work, from product design (door handle Erick, 2008) to master- planning (Oosterdokseiland in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, (1998-2001) and increasing focus on Central and Eastern Europe where he built the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Warsaw, Poland (1999-2004), ING Group Headquarters in Budapest, Hungary (1999-2004), Hotel Kempinski in Bratislava, Slovakia (2004-2008) and other projects. Erick van Egeraat was particularly interested to work in historical context, as shown in his projects of Liget Center (2000-2002) and Deak Palace (2003-2004) in Budapest, Hungary as well as master-plan of New Holland Island in Saint Petersburg, Russia (competition 2006). Working with historical buildings or in historical ambience, he aimed for ‚Äúcontinuity and memory rather than rupture and rejection‚Äù. In 2000s Erick van Egeraat started to work actively in Russia. The thrill of work in a new architectural environment made him design his \\"most spectacular, pure architecture project\\"Jodidio, P. \\"Architecture:Art\\". Prestel Verlag, Munich, Berlin, London, New York, 2005, pp. 224 Russian Avant-Garde in Moscow (2001) which made him \\"one of the most flamboyant architects in the Netherlands\\", according to the critics. Russian Avant-Garde and Federation Island in Sochi (2007) caused a stir and started a public discourse, but did not reach the stage of realization. The others were successfully built, among them: Capital City in Moscow (2002-2010)Egeraat, E. van. \\"Capital City Moscow\\". Book Industry Services, 2005, pp. 590, and Trade and Entertainment Center Vershina in Surgut (2005-2010). In 2009 Erick van Egeraat restructured his company into (designed by) Erick van Egeraat with offices in Rotterdam, Moscow, Budapest and Prague. Despite the world crisis, his focus on complexity and quality steadily grew. In Europe he completed the projects of Drents Museum in Assen, the Netherlands (2008-2011), Incineration Line in Roskilde, Denmark (2008-2013), Main building and Auditorium in Leipzig University, Germany (2004-2015) and Erasmus University College in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (2012-2014). In Russia he built Chess Academy in Khanty-Mansiysk (2008-2010), Corporate University of Sberbank in Moscow region (2010-2013) and completed Mercury City Tower in Moscow (2011-2013). His interest in working in historical context is manifest in his high-profile design of the new Dynamo stadium (winner of the competition, 2010) and master-planning, design and consultancy works for development of the territory of the former Red October chocolate factory (since 2007). Portfolio of Erick van Egeraat includes over 100 projects in more than 10 countries, including the Middle East where he created the master-plan for the city center of Unaizah (2014). Writings and design philosophy Erick van Egeraat authored several books. In Six Ideas about Architecture written in collaboration with Deyan SudjicEgeraat, E. van & Sudjic D. Six ideas about architecture. Birkh√§user: Basel, 1997, he takes us to the world of a person who, just like the hero of The Fountainhead ‚Äúloves this earth, but doesn‚Äôt like the shape of things on this earth and wants to change them.‚ÄùRand, A. The Fountainhead. Penguine Group (USA), 1994, e-, p.32 His definition of sustainable architecture marries beauty with quality: \\"We need to reintroduce architecture which once again captivates us. Beauty, strength and a focus on qualitative materials are essential elements from which a truly sustainable architecture can emerge. His later book 10 years Erick van Egeraat: Realized Works co-authored by Philip Jodidio, presents a comprehensive sweep of his oeuvre of the period 1995-2005, from the first post-Mecanoo years when he was trying to make a difference convinced that the future proof architecture needs to show \\"more than bare essentials\\". to the full architectural maturity, both loyal to long-established standards of beauty and decidedly contemporary: ‚ÄúI believe that all architecture of historic significance was modern at the time it was built, emerging from its time and culture.‚Äù His most recent book Life without Beauty elaborates on importance of beauty in architecture which in the 20th century lost a battle to budget: ‚ÄúIn Holland, the budget was the only subject. Many architects didn‚Äôt like the word ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù. He claims that ultimate measure for society or human being is not ability to make money, but its achievements and the beauty it has produced.Egeraat, E. van. Life without beauty.

According to the Azerbaijani Soviet Encyclopedia, Jabrayilov was captured in May 1942 in course of the battle for Donbas, and was kept in Dachau and Alsace-Lorraine concentration camps. In November 1942, he fled to join the partisans in France, took part in battles for the liberation of France, received several French awards (including M√©daille militaire for personal bravery) and was retired in 1946. In the newspaper, Bakinskiy Rabochiy (Baku Worker), Ms. Rugiya Aliyeva, an Azerbaijani journalist and author of the book Azerbaijanis in the European Movement of Resistance, tells the following story of Jabrayilov's life: According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta, de Gaulle met with Jabrayilov three times. Arriving in Moscow in 1966, de Gaulle included a meeting with Jabrayilov in his agenda. Jabrayilov was awarded the title of the \\"National Hero of France\\". He was also awarded the Legion of Honor and a number of other French decorations, including the Cross of Military Valour, which entitled him to march in parades ahead of the French generals.–¢–æ—Ç —Å–∞–º—ã–π –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ –∏–∑ –ë–∞–∫—É // –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞, 28.04.2015 According to the Translation Centre of the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan, Jabrayilov was a prisoner of war numbered 4167 and was placed in the camp near Marseille, which he fled to join French guerillas. In course of one of the combat operations, dressed in a German uniform, Jabrayilov was wounded and taken to a German hospital. Upon recovery, he was appointed commandant of the city of Albi, where he remained for eight months, gaining respect and credibility among his superiors and subordinates. Jabrayilov's actions to rescue prisoners of the concentration camps earned the admiration of de Gaulle. After the war, Jabrayilov, \\"one of the most respected members of the Union of Veterans of the Resistance\\" and \\"a legend of the Resistance\\", married a French woman, with whom he had two children, and worked in the office of Charles de Gaulle. In Dijon, an automobile factory was named after Jabrayilov. However, in 1951, Jabrayilov decided to return to the USSR. The United States offered \\"the famous reconnaissance man\\" American citizenship, France offered to gift Jabrayilov the factory named after him, but Jabrayilov rejected the offers. Upon his return to his native village, Okhud, he barely managed to avoid arrest and was forced to work as a shepherd.

According to Jabrayilov's story, one day, during their walk in Paris, Charles de Gaulle and Jabrayilov were approached by a person in a hijab, and Jabrayilov hit that person. In response to de Gaulle's indignation as to how a Muslim could raise a hand on a Muslim woman, Jabrayilov tore the hijab off of that person revealing that it was actually not a Muslim woman, but a German officer disguised in a hijab.

History  The Church of the Ascension was originally constructed by a Roman noblewoman named Poimenia around AD 390. The adjoining hostelry was built by two Western Christians: Rufinus and Melania, an aristocratic lady of Spanish descent. This first structure was destroyed by the Persians in 614, but replaced by St Modestus shortly thereafter. Around 1150 the establishment was rebuilt under the orders of Bernard de Tremelay, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, and remained a Templar possession until taken over by the Muslims under Saladin in 1187. It has been in Muslim hands ever since, though has always catered mainly for Christian visitors. Part of the basement of the Templar structure currently serves as the Internet suite for hotel guests, and can also be hired out as a meeting room. One of the oldest surviving Baphomet carvings can be seen above the door to the hotel kitchen, at the far end. The rest of the building was renovated in 1960 by its owners, the Khweis family, and replaced with a much larger modern construction.  Description  The hotel has 54 rooms, 11 of which command dramatic views of Jerusalem from the highest vantage point in the city. In addition to the Church of the Ascension, which adjoins the hotel to the south, the Garden of Gethsemane is approximately ten minutes walk away to the west, down the steep slope of the Dominus Flevit (\\"Jesus Wept\\"). The Old City of Jerusalem is a further ten minutes away (across the busy modern Jericho ring road, which runs through the Kidron Valley), and is entered through the Lions' Gate (St Stephen's Gate) and the Via Dolorosa. Many other Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy sites are also in the vicinity. The hotel is owned by Ibrahim Dawud.

It screens for red-green deficiencies, but not the much rarer blue color deficiency.  History  The test was developed by Dr. Dean Farnsworth (Commander, United States Navy) while stationed at the Naval Submarine Research Laboratory in New London, Connecticut during World War II. After its adoption by the United States Navy in 1954 as the standard color vision test for sailors aboard ship, it has additionally been used to screen flying personnel.  Test Procedure  The test consists of showing a pair of vertically oriented lights consisting of combinations of either red, green or yellow-white. The test subject is asked to identify the two colors (some of which are identical). Nine color pairs are administered during the test, beginning with a red/green combination, to allow the patient to see these two colors prior to seeing a white light, which decreases testing errors. The examinee is shown the target for only two seconds, as color-deficient patients can sometimes correctly identify the colors with prolonged exposure. The yellow-white light, or one of the identical paired lights, employs a 50% neutral gray filter to reduce luminance cues to the color-deficient patient. Random presentation reduces memorization of the test sequence by motivated persons.  Results Assessment  Errors by color-deficient patients tend to be of two types. The first is mis-calling the white light the complement of the colors presented. For example, red-white is said to be \\"red-green\\", or green-white is called \\"green-red\\". The second is when a pair of lights of the same color but differing in brightness by 50% is displayed, the brighter identical color is said to be \\"white\\". For example, green(dim)-green(bright) is called \\"green-white\\". Dichromats, by definition, cannot distinguish any of the colors, and only make correct answers by random guessing. The Military Medical Purchase Description specifies the lights in the FALANT in terms of percent luminous transmittance and 1931 CIE x,y chromaticity coordinates, calculated from Illuminant A, from spectrophotometric measurements of the glass filter components that make up the lantern. Illuminant A is approximated by a 115 volt, 40 watt T8 tungsten lamp inside the FALANT. By design, the FALANT allows mild color-blindness conditions to pass the test, while still excluding most of the moderate or severe cases of color-deficiency. The test is intended to mimic the types of situations requiring color vision that a sailor would find while serving aboard a ship. A passing test is no mistakes in the first nine pairs, or only two mistakes in the eighteen presentations shown to the examinee.  Test Evaluation  Research has shown a sensitivity of only 25% for detecting color vision deficiencies, and occasionally the FaLant allows moderate or even severely color deficient trichromats to pass, especially if given enough attempts with allowed errors, or given improperly by the technician. Administration errors are frequent, when not given in the correct lighting conditions, timing or distance. Testing errors are reduced by standardization of the verbal instructions, rules for administration, and scoring method. Four important phrases are: (1) \\"Remember, only three colors - red, green, and white\\", (2) \\"They look like signal lights at a distance\\", (3) \\"Call out the colors as soon as you see them\\", (4) \\"They can be in any combination or the same\\".  Usage in Aviation  The FALANT is accepted by the United States Federal Aviation Administration as a test of color vision for the purpose of obtaining a pilot's license. However, the United States Air Force discontinued use of the FALANT in 1993 due to its frequent failure to identify cases of color blindness considerably more serious than the test was intended to let pass. The original FALANT apparatus is no longer manufactured, but many modern equivalents of various levels of sophistication are available today, such as the Optec-900.

It was the home of John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare. It was burnt down during the Anglo-Irish war in 1920. Today it is mostly a ruin.  History  The house was built sometime in the mid-18th century, and was first occupied around 1750. It was subsequently purchased by the Fitzgibbon family, who were later to become the Earls of Clare. The estate covered of land, being bounded to the south by the Mulkear River, the Shannon to the west, and extending some 2 and a half miles along the main Limerick to Castleconnell road from Annacotty to Newgarden. Many parts of the boundary wall still exist today, on the modern Mountshannon road.Modern interior of the house John FitzGibbon, later known as Earl of Clare or Lord Clare, was Attorney-General for Ireland in 1783, then Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1789, (in which capacity he was first promoted to the Irish peerage). He was a controversial figure in Irish history, being described variously as a Protestant hardliner, a staunch anti-Catholic, and an early supporter of Union with England (which finally happened shortly before his death). He is said to have been an early opponent of measures for Catholic political relief (meaning the removal of some or all legal disabilities against Catholics) in both Ireland and Great Britain, and may have been the first to suggest to George III that the King would violate his coronation oath if he consented to the admission of Catholics to Parliament. He lived in this house for most of his life and career. Despite this hardline reputation, the Fitzgibbon Family was known locally to be fair landlords. This local reputation, however, did not prevent Lord Clare from being known as ‚ÄúBlack Jack Fitzgibbon‚Äù nationally, apparently because of his hardline opposition to Catholic emancipation.  Architecture  The house was built in neo-Palladian style. The front 7-bay entrance was adorned by four ionic columns, the rear had a large conservatory. Following its destruction in 1920, it has stood as a ruin, and has been partly demolished. However, the front columns still stand, as well as most of the main wings of the house.

The duo consisted originally of Anders Hagstr√∂m (vocals, songwriter, music, and programming) and Yasmine Uhlin (vocals). Uhlin left the band after the release of their EP, Morning Star in a Black Car, and was replaced by Kari Berg (vocals) as the lead female vocalist. Berg was a member of Ashbury Heights until 2010 and was featured on one album, Take Cair Paramour. In 2010, following a long-running dispute between Hagstr√∂m and the Out of Line label, the band disbanded. The dispute was settled in 2011, whereupon Hagstr√∂m and Out of Line renewed their collaboration. In 2013, Tea F.

Her colleagues there included the future People's Artist of the USSR Tamara Khanum and the future People‚Äôs Artist of Uzbekistan Gavkhar Rakhimova. Shortly after joining the group, on 8 March 1928 she and another dancer went onstage and publicly removed their face-veils. When the dance troupe was visiting her hometown of Margilan she decided to visit her family. Her aunt brought her into the house, and told her that her brother was looking for her. He then stabbed her to death, and immediately confessed to the crime after police arrived at the scene. He had admitted that the murder was premeditated, at the insistence of their father Salimxo ªja, the ming-boshi and mullah Kamal G'iasov, who made him swear on the Koran to kill her. The day after her death a massive funeral was held in the public square. Thousands of people attended the memorial, and women threw off their face-veils in front of her coffin. Salixo ªja and Salimxo ªja were eventually tried and executed for their role in the murder, and the ming-boshi and mullah were exiled.

The term has largely been superseded, but is still used on some lines. Germany In Germany Eilzug trains were middle-distance trains that usually ran between two conurbations and only stopped at important railway stations. In several public transport systems, there are also metropolitan railways (Stadtbahn, US: rapid transit) where trains on some routes run as Eilz√ºge, stopping at fewer stations. The successor to the Eilzug in Germany today is the Regional-Express train. The term Eilzug was introduced first in Bavaria in 1902, and later in Prussia in 1907 and Saxony in 1908, for express trains with no supplementary fare, and which as a rule were formed of older compartment coaches. From about 1919 they only ran with second and third class passenger classes. From 7 October 1928 a supplement had to be paid for Eilz√ºge, which was usually half the express train fare. During the 1930s specific coaches or Eilzugwagen were designed and built for them. They were built in various classes until the 1950s. From 1952 there were also the so-called St√§dteschnellz√ºge ('city express trains') that were supplement-free. Later the DB scrapped the Eilzug supplement completely; the DR followed suit in 1991. In the 1960s the concept widened. There were Eilzug trains that worked branch lines and had distinct long-distance duties - known in everyday speech as Heckeneilzug (hedgerow Eilzug) ‚Äì and so-called Bezirkseilz√ºge (district Eilz√ºge), which handled the busy local services in built-up areas. Several of these trains have been called StadtExpress trains since 1995. The DB's expresses (D-Z√ºge), which attracted a supplementary fare until 1982, ran on some sections as Eilzug trains. For example, nos. D 895 and D 564 from Saarbr√ºcken to Munich, which ran via the South Palatinate railway (S√ºdpfalzbahn) and were classified from Karlsruhe as an Eilzug service. The international express Donaukurier (the Danube Courier), D 222, from Vienna ran from Cologne to Dortmund as an Eilzug in the early 1980s. Many Eilz√ºge, that were formed from D-Zug coaches ran from 1982 onwards in the D-Zug category, but without supplementary fares. As a result of the reclassification of services following the foundation of Deutsche Bahn, the Eilzug was gradually abandoned to 1995 and replaced by other train services. There is no direct successor to the Eilzug; today, the Regional-Express is the closest comparable service to the Eilzug. That said, the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG) runs Eilz√ºge on several lines. For example, they work the Alb Valley Railway, the Hardt Railway, the Kraichgau Railway and the Murg Valley Railway as S-Bahn Eilzug services of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn network and pass many stations there without stopping. In addition, the AVG also operates several trains (comparable to the Regionalbahnen) on the route from Karlsruhe Central - Bundenthal-Rumbach (May to October) as Eilzug services. These use diesel railcars. Austria Austria had an Eilzug category until 9 December 2006. Austrian Eilz√ºge usually only had second class coaches. Eilzug trains with first class seats, which also handled long-distance services, were called Sprinters. Since 10 December 2006 the terms Eilzug and Sprinter have been dropped in favour of Regional-Express. Switzerland The term Eilzug (in western Switzerland semi-direct) was used for the category of train in between express trains and ordinary passenger or stopping trains (which stopped at every station). That meant it could be used for fast passenger trains, as well as express services with numerous stops and which partly ran on branch lines. Many 'Eilz√ºge disappeared on the systematic reorganisation of the timetable, e.g. St. Gallen ‚Äì Rapperswil ‚Äì Z√ºrich, with the concentration of services, e.g. Winterthur ‚Äì B√ºlach ‚Äì Zurzach ‚Äì Basle, others were upgraded to tourist trains, e.g. the Voralpenexpress, and others run today as fast S-Bahn trains, e.g. S 44 on the Berne S-Bahn; the rest have mainly been reclassified as RegioExpress trains. Czech Republic The term spƒõ≈°n√Ω vlak is still on use, and like most Czech trains, doesn't require a supplement to use. Its definition is quite similar to the German one.

The building is located at the five-way intersection of Westwood Boulevard, Kinross Avenue, and Broxton Avenue. In 1929 the Janss Dome was the first building erected in the Mediterranean-themed Westwood Village. It housed the headquarters of the Janss Investment Company run by the Janss brothers, Edwin and Harold Janss, who were the developers of the village. The village was built as a shopping and cinema precinct to serve the adjacent University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The second floor of the Janss building was the first male dormitory for UCLA students. The Janss Dome was designed by the architectural firm of Allison & Allison, who also designed UCLA‚Äôs Royce Hall and Kerckhoff Hall. Architectural features of the building include a high portico and arched windows with the main part of the building having an octagonal shape and being surmounted by its signature dome with its Moorish style aqua and white zig-zag pattern and gold leafing. Atop the dome is a cupola. This dome ranks alongside the white Spanish Revival/Moderne tower of the Fox Theater as an iconic landmark of Westwood Village. Around the beginning of the 1990s renowned architectural firm Morphosis adapted the dome for use as a clothing store by Contempo Casuals,LA Access - Richard Saul Wurman, (Harper Perennial) 1991 - page 85 and later it was occupied by a Wherehouse Music store. In 1998 restaurateur Michael Chow remodeled the interior for a Eurochow restaurant but had the time-honored aqua and white zig-zag on the rotunda painted over in white. This caused the Westwood Design Review Board to order that the dome be restored to its traditional decoration. The Janss Dome housed a Japanese restaurant, Yamato, until June 2016. In 1971, the Paramount Securities Corporation, (Michael & Elliot Lewis), purchased the property from Bank of America.The property,(Dome section), was leased to Glendale Federal Savings and Loan.A Cupola was placed on the dome, and an original Sir Richard Wallace fountain,dated 1872,(French)was added to the patio.

During the battle, Renomm√©e and Clorinde badly battered Galatea, with the result that she lost 16 men killed and 46 wounded - the largest number of casualties of any vessel in the squadron. Astraea too was heavily engaged and the British captured Renomm√©e. Roquebert had sacrificed his flagship and ultimately his life to allow the frigates Clorinde and the badly damaged N√©r√©ide to escape. Astrea lost two men killed and 16 men wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the award of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Off Tamatave 20 May 1811\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Five days later, Schomberg's squadron rediscovered N√©r√©ide at Tamatave. The British persuaded the town's commander to surrender the town and N√©r√©ide without any further fight. The British took N√©r√©ide as . The battle was the last action of the Mauritius campaign. On 19 September she and Racehorse captured the French slaver brig Eclair. After Beaver died in April 1813, Schomberg moved to Beaver's flagship, . Captain John Eveleigh then took command of Astraea. Astrea vs. Etoile In early 1814 Astrea was in company with , which was under the command of Captain George Charles Mackenzie, who was Eveleigh's senior. The two frigates sailed for the Cape Verde Islands; they reached Maio early on 23 January 1814.James (1837), Vol. 6, p. 261-264. Off the Cape Verde Islands they encountered two frigates and two merchant ships, one a brigantine and the other a schooner, all at anchor. The French frigates did not respond to the Portuguese and Spanish flags that the British set and instead set sail as the British frigates approached; the British frigates then pursued them. Astrea had problems with her sails so Creole pulled ahead. She exchanged some shots and eventually four broadsides with the rearmost French frigate, which would turn out to be Sultane. Astraea then sailed between Creole and her opponent, coming alongside the French frigate. Two broadsides from Astrea then temporarily silenced the French frigate as fires aboard Creole took her out of the action for a while. She re-engaged Sultane, but then disengaged and sailed towards Santiago. Astraea went ahead in pursuit of the first French frigate, which turned out to be the Etoile. Astraea exchanged a broadside and then crossed Etoiles bow and raked her. At this moment a shot took away Astraeas wheel and killed both quartermasters, causing Astraea to lose direction and momentum. Now the situation reversed, with French guns nearly touching Astraeas taffrail. She received broadsides that tore away her lower rigging, scarred her deck and destroyed one of her carronades. However, she suffered no damage forward. Astrea was able to get starboard to starboard with her opponent. The two vessels exchanged broadsides at close range for two hours until Etoile sailed off. During the engagement a pistol shot hit Eveleigh below the heart, mortally wounding him. Sultane came up and also exchanged a broadside with Astrea. Astrea, much damaged, broke off the engagement as the two French frigates too sailed away. Creole had suffered ten men dead and 26 wounded; Astrea lost nine men dead and 37 wounded. That evening the two British ships anchored in Porto Praya on Santiago to effect repairs. ( later captured Etoile.) Command of Astraea passed to Captain William Black. On 6 June, Astrea and Creole were in company when they captured the Spanish slave ship Gestruydis la Preciosa, and her cargo of slaves. At this time Astrea was under the command of Captain Benjamin Askley. Fate Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Astraea spent seven years in ordinary. In 1823 the Navy converted her into hospital ship, in which state she remained until she was broken up in 1851.

Hassan is a right- arm fast bowler who represented Afghanistan in international cricket. He has also appeared in first-class cricket for Pakistan Customs in Pakistan, Marylebone Cricket Club in England and Band-e-Amir Region in Afghanistan. Early life and career Hassan was born in 1987. He was the second of three sons; his older brother was Rashid and his younger brother was Shamshad. When Hassan was six years old, his family fled fighting in their home district of Bati Kot near Jalalabad, Afghanistan to go to Pakistan as refugees. They lived in a refugee camp Peshawar, where Hassan learned to play cricket on the streets with a taped tennis ball from his older brother Rashid. Cricket had a stigma among his people, and when his grades started to suffer at school as a result of cricket, his parents tried to stop him from playing, but he continued to play in secret. Hassan joined a cricket club in 2002 and got selected for a team to go to the ACC Under 17 Trophy in 2003. Hassan weighed nearly , but after watching the 2005 Ashes series on TV and being inspired by Andrew Flintoff, he lost weight until he was down to so that he could bowl fast. In March 2006, Hassan played a match for Afghanistan against a Marylebone Cricket Club team led by Mike Gatting in Mumbai. Afghanistan thrashed MCC by 179 runs, and Hassan took the wicket of Gatting. He was subsequently invited to join MCC Young Cricketers. At 20 years of age, Hassan became the first Afghanistani to play cricket at Lord‚Äôs. He played for the Marylebone Cricket Club in a match against a European XI in June 2007. He bowled with good control at over , with Mike Gatting calling him a ‚Äúhuge potential‚Äù. International career =World Cricket League= Hassan was part of Afghanistan‚Äôs squad for the 2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Five in Jersey, which was the start of the qualification process for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Hassan took three wickets in Afghanistan‚Äôs win against Botswana and two wickets in their win over Nepal, which gave Afghanistan a place in the tournament final and ensured they would progress to the next stage of World Cup qualification. He was Afghanistan‚Äôs best bowler in the tournament final against Jersey, taking four wickets for 27 runs, decimating Jersey‚Äôs middle order and giving Afghanistan control of the match. Hassan began division four with a dominant performance against Fiji. Though Afghanistan had only managed to score 132 runs in their innings, Hassan took four wickets for 25 runs as Afghanistan bowled out Fiji for just 52, starting the tournament with an 80-run win. Hassan was influential through the rest of the tournament, taking three wickets against Tanzania and running out Joe Scuderi when Afghanistan defeated Italy, gaining another promotion to the next stage of the World Cricket League. Afghanistan won the tournament final against Hong Kong, and Hassan almost finished the tournament with a hat-trick. He took two wickets on consecutive deliveries, but bowled a front-foot no-ball on the third. Hassan was then an instrumental part of Afghanistan‚Äôs team for division three, taking three wickets in matches against both Papua New Guinea and Cayman Islands. Afghanistan won the tournament and qualified for the World Cup Qualifier, returning to Afghanistan expecting a large crowd to receive them in Kabul. =World Cup Qualifier= Hassan was in Afghanistan‚Äôs squad for the 2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, which was the first time Afghanistan had participated in the event. During the group stage of the tournament, Hassan mostly played as a first-change bowler, and he surprised opposition teams in the tournament with his skill and pace, with Bermuda captain Irving Romaine claiming he was one of the fastest bowlers in the tournament. Hassan took two wickets against Bermuda, and Afghanistan progressed from the group stage of the tournament to the Super Eights. Opening the bowling against Ireland, Hassan took five wickets. He dismissed William Porterfield early, then removed Ireland‚Äôs two established batsmen Andrew White and Kevin O‚ÄôBrien in consecutive overs before taking two more wickets in Ireland‚Äôs tail. Four of his five wickets came bowled. His bowling performance was enough to give Afghanistan a 22-run win, causing a massive upset over the team who went on to win the tournament. Hassan was far less successful in the next match against Canada, conceding 32 runs in three overs. Afghanistan lost to Canada and their chances of qualifying for the World Cup were virtually over. Hassan finished the tournament with 3/37 against Namibia and 3/26 against Scotland, and though they didn‚Äôt qualify for the World Cup, Afghanistan did achieve official One Day International status for the next four years. In 2010, Hassan compared Afghanistan's rise through the ranks of international cricket with the film Rocky. =Early success in first-class cricket= Hassan played for Afghanistan in the 2009-10 ICC Intercontinental Cup, the first time Afghanistan had participated in the first-class tournament. In a match against the Netherlands, Hassan took four wickets in the first innings and was batting at the end of the final innings when Afghanistan won the thrilling match by a single wicket. Hassan recorded his first ten-wicket haul against Scotland. After Afghanistan had been bowled out for 435 runs in the first innings, Hassan bowled first change and almost took the wicket of Fraser Watts immediately. Watts hit the ball straight to second slip, but the fielder dropped the catch and the ball went to the boundary for four runs. Later in the over he got Watts to edge the ball in the same direction and had him caught. He then caused a middle-order collapse, taking five wickets in a period in which Scotland lost seven wickets for just 19 runs. Most of his wickets came caught behind by the wicket-keeper, and he finished the innings with 6 wickets for 40 runs. During Scotland‚Äôs second innings, Hassan injured his ankle and was told by doctors not to bowl, but he decided to bowl regardless and bowled a further 27 overs. He took 5 wickets in the second innings to finish with 11 for the match. In Afghanistan‚Äôs next match against Kenya, Hassan got his second ten-wicket haul. He took five of Afghanistan‚Äôs first six wickets in the first innings to leave Kenya at 90 for 6, then followed it up with 6 wickets in the second innings to single-handedly win the game for Afghanistan on the final day. This took Afghanistan to the Intercontinental Cup Final against Scotland, where Afghanistan won by seven wickets and Hassan was named the player of the match after taking 8 wickets despite playing with a heel injury. Hassan took by far the most wickets for the whole tournament, with 43 wickets from 6 matches at a bowling average of 19.18 (the next-most wickets was 24 wickets by Scotland's Majid Haq). He was named as one of the bowlers in the team of the tournament. In March 2011 he was called up by the Marylebone Cricket Club to represent them in the Champion County match against Nottinghamshire. He was impressive with the ball, taking seven wickets for the match, but his most entertaining performance was with the bat. He came out at number 11 in MCC's first innings and hit his first three deliveries for four. He scored 26 runs from 14 deliveries before being dismissed. =2010 World Twenty20= Hassan was a crucial part of the Afghanistan team in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier as their specialist death bowler, bowling the final overs of most matches. He took wickets throughout the tournament and played an important role in Afghanistan‚Äôs wins over Scotland, the United States and the United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan won the tournament and qualified for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, and Hassan himself took 12 wickets throughout the tournament at a bowling average of just 11.14. At the World Twenty20, Hassan was a standout both with the ball and, unusually, with the bat. In Afghanistan‚Äôs second and final match against South Africa, Hassan bowled very well at the death, taking 3 wickets for 21 runs from his four overs to restrict South Africa to 139 runs. Afghanistan then collapsed to be 32 for 8 when Hassan came to the crease, but he scored a quick 22 runs from 21 balls to help Afghanistan avoid the lowest score of the tournament. Despite having lost both matches, Hassan was proud of Afghanistan‚Äôs performance at the World Twenty20 and believed they needed to play more matches against full members to improve. =2011‚Äì15 Cycle: Injuries and World Cup Debut= Following the 2011 Cricket World Cup, which Afghanistan did not qualify for, Hassan played with Afghanistan in both the 2011‚Äì13 ICC Intercontinental Cup and the 2011‚Äì13 ICC World Cricket League Championship, which ran simultaneously to each other. After playing cricket against domestic teams in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, these tournaments began for Afghanistan in Canada in August 2011. Afghanistan batted first in the Intercontinental Cup match, and were bowled out for 293 before the end of the first day. Afghanistan then had 12 overs to bowl to Canada before the end of the day, and Hassan managed to take four wickets for 12 runs before stumps. He followed this up the next day with 3 more wickets to achieve figures of 7/61, his best ever first-class bowling figures. Hassan then took three early wickets in Canada's second innings to record his third ten-wicket haul, and he was named the player-of-the match in a nine-wicket win. Hassan was selected to play for a combined Associate and Affiliate XI in a tour match against England in Dubai in January 2012. Hassan took two early wickets in England's first innings, but on the second day he fell over the boundary fence and injured himself, causing him to miss the rest of the match. Though he was initially cleared of any serious damage, the knee injury kept him out of international cricket until he was named in Afghanistan's squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20, where due to fitness concerns he was still unable to play any matches. Hassan returned to good bowling form in the latter half of 2013, with impressive bowling performances in limited overs cricket against Namibia and Kenya as Afghanistan secured qualification for the 2015 Cricket World Cup. His return to form was expected to make him a key player in the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, and Afghanistan went into the tournament as favourites to win it, but his knee injury flared up again after playing just one match and he missed the rest of the tournament. He was replaced in Afghanistan's squad by Izatullah Dawlatzai and they still qualified for the World Twenty20 without Hassan. Hassan was named in Afghanistan's squad for both the 2014 Asia Cup and the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, but his knee injury continued to cause problems and he missed more matches. Hassan again returned from injury in December 2014 for an ODI series against the UAE, and he took 5 for 45 in the fourth match of the series. This gave Afghanistan the confidence to include him in their squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup despite his proneness to injury. Hassan opened the bowling in Afghanistan's opening match against Bangladesh, bowling Afghanistan's first ever ball in a World Cup match. He was able to keep Bangladesh's openers slow at the start of the match, but he finished the match with expensive figures of 2/61 and Afghanistan lost by 105 runs. Hassan's bowling was fast and precise against Sri Lanka. He dismissed Kumar Sangakkara early with a delivery that swung in from outside off to bowl him, celebrating with a cartwheel and leaving Sri Lanka at 3/18. Hassan then bowled two consecutive deliveries past the edge of Dimuth Karunaratne's bat before having him caught at slip at 4/51. Hassan took three wickets in total, and for most of the match it looked like Afghanistan could win, but late in the innings Thisara Perera hit a very quick 47 runs from 26 balls to get Sri Lanka across the line. Hassan gained international notoriety after this match because he celebrated taking the wicket of Kumar Sangakkara with a cartwheel. Afghanistan's match against Scotland was their only match against a fellow associate team for the World Cup, and thus the match they were considered most likely to win. After bowling a very economical 1/32 from 10 overs in the first innings, Hassan came in to bat in the second innings with Afghanistan still needing another 79 runs for victory. He provided support for teammate Samiullah Shenwari in a ninth-wicket stand of 60 runs, following Shenwari's instructions about when to farm the strike and when to rotate it. Shenwari hit a number of sixes in their partnership, but was caught at deep midwicket attempting a fourth inside one over. This left Hassan with fellow tailender Shapoor Zadran still needing to score another 19 runs to achieve victory. Hassan stayed in until the end of the innings with 15 runs in over an hour of batting, and Shapoor hit the winning runs in the final over to give Afghanistan their maiden World Cup victory. Hassan bowled Australian James Faulkner with a beautiful in-swinging yorker in Afghanistan's fourth match, but his bowling figures were 1/70 from 10 overs and Afghanistan lost by 275 runs to the eventual champions. Following the match, Hassan spoke with Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc about shoes, as Hassan had gone through five pairs of bowling shoes already in the World Cup. Hassan bowled economically against New Zealand with 0/36 off of 7 overs, and in Afghanistan's final match against England he was the only Afghanistan bowler to take a wicket, removing Alex Hales with a thin outside edge. Despite being referred to by ground announcers as a medium-pace bowler, Hassan was Afghanistan's fastest bowler at the World Cup; his bowling was measured at speeds of over . =2015‚Äìpresent= Hassan played Afghanistan's first three matches in the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, taking six wickets across the three matches, but he limped off the field after bowling the 19th over against Scotland and missed Afghanistan's subsequent two matches, both of which were losses. He returned to the side for a win against Papua New Guinea, which put Afghanistan into the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. Due to a thigh injury, Hassan was not able to represent Afghanistan again until the World Twenty20 itself, missing all matches between the two tournaments. He was ineffective at the World Twenty20, only playing four of Afghanistan's seven matches and taking three wickets. Hassan was last selected to play for the national team in a T20I series against Zimbabwe in February 2018, but he again got injured in the team's training camp in Sharjah and was advised to rest. He last played an international match for his national team in July 2016. He was attempting to return to the national team in time to play in the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In April 2019, he was named in Afghanistan's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. The International Cricket Council (ICC) named him as one of the five surprise picks for the tournament. Domestic cricket =England= In 2009, Hassan signed to play for Skegness Cricket Club for six seasons in the Lincolnshire Premier League. He took 7/53 in his debut match, but after the 2009 season he didn't play for Skegness again. =Bangladesh Premier League= Hassan signed to play with the Barisal Burners in the 2012 season for $40,000 but his injuries meant he was unable to play. He signed again for the 2013 season for the same salary. Player profile =Bowling= An innings-by-innings breakdown of Hassan's ODI bowling career, showing wickets taken (black and blue bars), the career bowling average to date (green line) and the average of the last five innings (blue line). Hassan is a right-arm fast bowler. At times he has been measured bowling over . In the 2015 Cricket World Cup he took the wickets of world-class batsmen such as Kumar Sangakkara, causing problems with his pace and swing. He took 50 wickets in his first 26 One Day Internationals, making him the sixth fastest player of all time to reach 50 ODI wickets. =Batting= batting average to date (green line) and the average of the last five innings (blue line). Hassan is a lower-order batsman with a very low batting average in international cricket. Despite a general lack of success with the bat, he has played good batting innings. He scored 26 runs off of just 14 balls in the 2011 Champion County match, and he scored 22 runs in a match in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, the second-highest score for Afghanistan in the innings. Commentary Hassan commentated the 2018 Afghanistan Premier League both in international and Afghan languages. Personal life Hassan's house in Jalalabad was targeted by a grenade attack in February 2018. Hassan was unharmed in the attack. Hassan's family claimed that the attack came in the wake of criminal groups demanding money from the family. The Afghanistan Cricket Board stated that the attack was carried out by criminal groups, not by terrorists.

After being in use for more than 45 years, the irrigation canal Peqin‚ÄìKavaj√´ has been reconstructed and is still being used for irrigation. Future projects foresee its use on the field of hydroelectricity in the framework of the Banja Hydropower Plant, as his dream and vision was. The Irrigation Canal Vjos√´-Levan-Fier was a Work of unique and extraordinary dimensions for the time it was designed, far in 1955.

The history of Futbol Club Barcelona goes from the football club's founding in 1899 and up to current time. FC Barcelona, also known simply as Barcelona and familiarly as Bar√ßa, is based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The team was founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Spanish footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club played amateur football until 1910 in various regional competitions. In 1910, the club participated in their first of many European competitions, and has since amassed fourteen UEFA trophies and a sextuple. In 1928, Barcelona co-founded La Liga, the top-tier in Spanish football, along with a string of other clubs. As of 2020, Barcelona has never been relegated from La Liga, a record they share with Athletic Bilbao and arch-rival Real Madrid. The history of Barcelona has often been political. Though it was a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona gradually became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as a focal point for Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became one of the few places the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s ‚Äì a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players ‚Äì club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.  Beginnings of Football Club Barcelona (1899‚Äì1922)  Joan Gamper laid the foundation of FC Barcelona. On 22 October 1899, Joan Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Sol√© on 29 November. Eleven players attended: Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Llu√≠s d'Oss√≥, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Josep Llobet, John Parsons and William Parsons. As a result, Football Club Barcelona was born.Ball, Phil p. 89 The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900; the prevailing Catalonia conception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.Ball, Phil pp. 90‚Äì91 Gamper's advertisement in Los Deportes, requesting players for the team that later became the Futbol Club Barcelona. Ricardo Zamora played for Barcelona from 1919 to 1922. FC Barcelona quickly emerged as one of the leading clubs in Spain, competing in the Campeonato de Catalu√±a and the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and also played in the first Copa del Rey final, losing 2‚Äì1 to Bizcaya. In 1908, Joan Gamper became club president for the first time to save the club from bankruptcy. The club had not won since the Campeonato de Catalu√±a in 1905; this caused their financial trouble. One of his main achievements was to help Barcelona acquire its own stadium and thus achieve a stable income. On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Ind√∫stria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, a logo contest was held the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears , with some minor changes. With the new stadium, Barcelona participated in the inaugural version of the Pyrenees Cup, which, at the time, consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, MIDI and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was generally considered the most prestigious in that era.Murray, Bill; Murray, William J. p. 30 From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala played an integral part of the four-time champion, managing the side along with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.Closa et al. p. 62‚Äì63 The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona, which local rivals Espanyol won. During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.Spaaij, Ram√≥n. p. 279 On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ram√≥n Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6‚Äì2. Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club-members, and, by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year. Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 22,000, and was later expanded to 60,000. Gamper recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After he was hired, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field. During the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campeonato de Catalu√±a, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups and enjoyed its first \\"golden age\\". Rivera, Republic and Civil War (1923‚Äì1957) Poet Rafael Alberti wrote a poem hailing the Barcelona goalkeeper Franz Platko. On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.Shubert, Adrian. p. 200 This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.Arnaud, Pierre; Riordan, James. p. 103 On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alc√°ntara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane. In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \\"Oda a Platko\\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko. Two years after the victory, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems. Barcelona's Copa del Rey-winning squad of 1928. Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escol√†, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.Burns, Jimmy. pp. 111‚Äì112 Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936 and 1938, success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them. A month after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.Arnaud, Pierre; Riordan, James. p. 104 On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.Spaaij, Ram√≥n. pp. 280 He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.Ball, Phil. pp. 116‚Äì117 In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.Murray, Bill; Murray, William. p. 70Ball, Phil. pp. 118‚Äì120 The aerial bombardment of Barcelona seen from one of the bombers On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.Raguer, Hilari. pp. 223‚Äì225Graham, Helen. p. 351 A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the \\"undisciplined\\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, and faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de F√∫tbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.Burns, Jimmy. pp. 80‚Äì83 In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del General√≠simo. The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3‚Äì0. Before the second leg, Franco's director of state security visited Barcelona's players in the changing room. He reminded them that they were only playing due to the \\"generosity of the regime\\". Real Madrid comfortably won the match, beating Barcelona 11‚Äì1. Despite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like C√©sar, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949. In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina. In June 1950, Barcelona signed Ladislao Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club. On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2‚Äì1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.Ferrand, Alain; McCarthy, Scott. p. 90Witzig, Richard. p. 408 Coach Fernando Dauƒç√≠k and player L√°szl√≥ Kubala, regarded by many as the club's best, inspired the team to several trophies in 1952, including La Liga, the Copa del General√≠simo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte and the Copa Martini Rossi. In 1953, they helped the club win La Liga and the Copa del General√≠simo again.  Club de F√∫tbol Barcelona (1957‚Äì1978)  The Camp Nou as seen above, was finished in 1957. With Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Su√°rez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by L√°szl√≥ Kubala, S√°ndor Kocsis and Zolt√°n Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play- off. However, they lost 2‚Äì3 to Benfica in the final. PSV in the 1977‚Äì78 UEFA Cup semi-finals. They also finished the season as Copa del Rey winners. The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players. The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fust√© and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del General√≠simo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1‚Äì0 in the 1968 Copa del General√≠simo final at the Santiago Bernab√©u ‚Äì in front of Francisco Franco ‚Äì with their coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the civil war. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1975, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again. Three of the most notable figures in the early history of Totaalvoetbal-inspired Bar√ßajax (Bar√ßa‚ÄìAjax) school: Johan Neeskens, Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff The 1973‚Äì74 season saw the arrival of a new player in Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record ¬£920,000 from Ajax.MacWilliam, Rab; MacDonald, Tom. p. 180 Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son Jordi, after the local Catalan Saint George.Ball, Phil. pp. 83‚Äì85 Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973‚Äì74 season for the first time since 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5‚Äì0 at the Santiago Bernab√©u along the way. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.  N√∫√±ez era and the rise of modern-day Bar√ßa model (1978‚Äì2000)  Josep Llu√≠s N√∫√±ez i Clemente was the longest-serving president in Bar√ßa's history. The original La Masia building was the symbolic home of Bar√ßa's youth academy. = First ten years (1978‚Äì1988) = In 1978, Josep Llu√≠s N√∫√±ez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1975 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as N√∫√±ez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such world-class players as Diego Maradona, Rom√°rio and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.Ball, Phil p. 85 On 16 May 1979, the club won its first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna D√ºsseldorf 4‚Äì3 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. The same year, N√∫√±ez began to invest in the club's youth program by converting La Masia to a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth program of Barcelona. In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of ¬£5 million from Boca Juniors.Dobson, Stephen; Goddard, John A. p. 180 In the following season, under coach C√©sar Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984‚Äì85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua Bucure»ôti after a 0‚Äì0 draw in Seville. Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president N√∫√±ez's dictatorial rule and the nationalist support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of N√∫√±ez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for N√∫√±ez's presidency.Spaaij, Ram√≥n p. 291-292 Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.Spaaij, Ram√≥n p. 293 After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top-scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987‚Äì88 season and replaced with Luis Aragon√©s. The season finished with the players rebelling against president N√∫√±ez, in an event known as the Hesperia Mutiny (El mot√≠ de l'Hesp√®ria/El mot√≠n del Hesperia), and a 1‚Äì0 victory at the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad. = From the Hesperia Mutiny to Cruyff's return as manager and building the Dream Team = Bar√ßa's longest consecutive serving professional manager and the principal builder of the \\"Dream Team\\", Cruyff won four consecutive La Liga titles and led the club to their first European Cup success. In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club as manager and he assembled the so-called \\"Dream Team\\". He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, Jos√© Mari Bakero and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Rom√°rio and Hristo Stoichkov. It was ten years after the inception of the youth program, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates who would later earn international acclaim was Pep Guardiola. Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley Stadium, with a free-kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de Espa√±a. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager to date. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years. Cruyff's fortune was to change, however, and in his final two seasons, after he failed to win any trophies, he fell out with president N√∫√±ez, resulting in his departure. The legacy that Cruyff gave Barcelona, however, was about more than just trophies and records, as he gave Bar√ßa a winning mentality and footballing identity/ideology that runs through the club till this day. When Cruyff took over as manager in 1988, Barcelona were in a situation of severe crisis (the so-called 'Hesperia Mutiny') and debt. In the space of just six years (1988‚Äì1994), Cruyff the manager, with his leadership and management skills, turned Bar√ßa from the domestic strugglers and perennial underachievers into a truly permanent powerhouse of La Liga and European club football in general. Between 1960 and 1990 the club won just two La Liga titles. In the early 1990s, the rise of Cruyff's Bar√ßa also officially marked the end of Real Madrid's era of overwhelming dominance (1960s‚Äì1980s) in La Liga history. Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall. The objective of the group, called L'Elefant Blau was to oppose the presidency of N√∫√±ez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.King, Anthony pp. 185‚Äì186Ball, Phil pp. 110‚Äì111 Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003. = Post-Cruyff period (1996‚Äì2000) = Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996‚Äì97. He recruited Ronaldo from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners Cup and the Supercopa de Espa√±a. Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available. Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Internazionale. New stars emerged, however, such as Lu√≠s Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Lile title and where Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and N√∫√±ez resigning in 2000.  The Gaspart Era (2000‚Äì2003)  The departures of N√∫√±ez and Louis van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Lu√≠s Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou with Madrid, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.Ball, Phil. p. 19 The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lloren√ß Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season. Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antiƒá, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antiƒá's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.Ball, Phil. pp. 109‚Äì110  An era of the Cruyffistas: Laporta, Begiristain, Rijkaard and Guardiola (2003‚Äì2010)  Cruyffista, Joan Laporta i Estruch has been one of the most successful presidents in the club's history.

(BackPage Press, ) Leo Messi in 2008 = Rijkaard's Bar√ßa side (2003‚Äì2008) = After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o and Rafael M√°rquez, combined with homegrown Spanish players Carles Puyol, Andr√©s Iniesta, Xavi and V√≠ctor Vald√©s, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de Espa√±a in 2004‚Äì05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards. 2005‚Äì06 season In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Barcelona repeated their Liga and Supercupa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium in a 3‚Äì0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernab√©u, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation. In the Champions League, Barcelona beat Arsenal 2‚Äì1 in the final. Trailing 1‚Äì0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2‚Äì1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years. 2006‚Äì07 season Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006‚Äì07 season without any trophies won. A pre-season United States tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Samuel Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticized coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form. In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi- finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5‚Äì2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4‚Äì0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional. In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on the away goals rule. 2007‚Äì08 season Barcelona finished the 2007‚Äì08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008. = Guardiola's Bar√ßa side (2008‚Äì2012) = 2008‚Äì09 season In the pre-season of 2008‚Äì09, a motion of no confidence was raised against club president Joan Laporta. This motion received 60 percent support, just short of the 66 percent required to oust him, prompting eight of the directors to resign. Continuing as president, Laporta made large changes to the playing staff, spending nearly ‚Ç¨90 million rebuilding the squad. For the second time that season, Barcelona played Real Madrid in El Cl√°sico, this time at the Santiago Bernab√©u. Barcelona won the historic match 2‚Äì6, which was the largest margin of victory by which Barcelona had won in Madrid since the 1970s, when Johan Cruyff led Barcelona to win 0‚Äì5. On 6 May 2009, Barcelona played against Chelsea in the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Following a goalless first leg, Chelsea led the second leg at Stamford Bridge 1‚Äì0, from the eighth minute until injury time, when Andr√©s Iniesta scored an equaliser in the 93rd minute from the edge of the penalty area, sending Barcelona through to the final on the away goals rule. On 13 May, Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 4‚Äì1 to win the Copa del Rey for a record 25th time. Three days later, Real Madrid lost a league match and Barcelona was crowned La Liga champions for the 2008‚Äì09 season. With a largely homegrown squad, in which seven players of the starting 11 were products of their youth academy, La Masia, Barcelona defeated the defending champions Manchester United 2‚Äì0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome on 27 May 2009, to earn their third Champions League title. This completed the first ever treble won by a Spanish side, having already won the La Liga and Copa del Rey in that season. 2009‚Äì10 season Barcelona went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de Espa√±a against Athletic Bilbao, and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk, becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup, thus becoming the first team ever to accomplish the sextuple. In May 2010, Barcelona won La Liga for the second consecutive time with a record Spanish league tally of 99 points out of 114 possible.  The Rosell Era (2010‚Äì2014)  =2010‚Äì11 season= On 13 June, Rosell was elected president of Barcelona with more than 60% of the vote of club members. Barcelona begin start off the season with the traditional curtain raiser, the Supercopa de Espa√±a, against Sevilla, losing the first leg 3‚Äì1 at the Ram√≥n S√°nchez Pizju√°n Stadium. In the return leg at the Camp Nou, however, the team would win 4‚Äì0, thus claiming the Supercopa 5‚Äì3 on aggregate. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, Barcelona would endure a slow start to the campaign, despite a victory over Racing de Santander (3‚Äì0) on the opening day of the season; they would go on to be defeated 2‚Äì0 at the Camp Nou by newly promoted minnows H√©rcules. Nevertheless, Bar√ßa would recover and go on to magnificent 5‚Äì0 win over Real Madrid at home. In the Champions League semi-finals against Madrid at the Santiago Bernab√©u, Lionel Messi scored two goals to ensure a 0‚Äì2 win for Barcelona, with the second leg at home ending in a 1‚Äì1 draw, sending Bar√ßa through to the Final to take on Manchester United. In the Copa del Rey Final at the Mestalla Stadium against Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo would convert a header on the 100th minute to win the Copa for Madrid, 1‚Äì0. Bar√ßa, however, would end up beating Manchester United 3‚Äì1 with goals from Pedro, Messi and David Villa to win them the Champions League for the fourth time in club history. Barcelona would also claim La Liga with 96 points to Real Madrid's 92 for the third time in a row to round off a very successful season. =2011‚Äì12 season= Barcelona celebrating their 2011 FIFA Club World Cup win against Santos FC. The 2011‚Äì12 season would kick off with the Supercopa de Espa√±a, this time against reigning Copa del Rey champions Real Madrid. In Madrid, Barcelona would play to a 2‚Äì2 draw, but would seal the Supercup with a 3‚Äì2 win at the Camp Nou. The first kick of a ball in La Liga for Bar√ßa would be at the Camp Nou against Villarreal, with the Catalans easily winning 5‚Äì0. In the first Liga Cl√°sico of the season, Barcelona would win 1‚Äì3 in Madrid to level on points with Madrid heading into the Christmas break. Nevertheless, Barcelona would drop two points away to Espanyol, which ended 1‚Äì1, to go two points behind their archrivals Madrid. In the Copa del Rey semi-finals, in the first leg against Real Madrid, the Blaugrana would win 1‚Äì2 in Madrid, later sealing their place in the semi-finals after a 2‚Äì2 draw at the Camp Nou. In the Round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League, the then-defending champions would defeat Bayer Leverkusen 1‚Äì3 in Germany and rout them 7‚Äì1 at the Camp Nou. The quarter- finals against Milan would begin slowly for the Catalan club, playing to a 0‚Äì0 draw in Milan, only to sweep the Italian club aside 3‚Äì1 at the Camp Nou with two strikes from Lionel Messi. In the semi-finals against Chelsea, Barcelona would be defeated 1‚Äì0 in London after a Didier Drogba strike in the 45th minute. The second leg, meanwhile, at the Nou Camp finished 2‚Äì2, thus eliminating Barcelona from European contention. In the penultimate game of the season at home to Real Madrid, perhaps the most important game of the Catalan club's season, Bar√ßa would collapse 1‚Äì2 to Real Madrid with a strike each from Sami Khedira and Cristiano Ronaldo, winning Los Blancos the match. On 27 April, coach Pep Guardiola announced in a tearful press conference in Barcelona that he would be stepping down as coach of the Catalan club at the end of the season, citing that he needed a break from football; he was to be replaced by Tito Vilanova. In Barcelona's final game of the season, the Copa del Rey finals against Athletic Bilbao, Bar√ßa would win 3‚Äì0 with a brace from Pedro and a strike from Messi, winning the club the trophy. That season, Bar√ßa would also win the 2011 UEFA Super Cup, 2‚Äì0 against Porto and the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, 4‚Äì0 against Santos. =2012‚Äì13 season= Bar√ßa's 2012‚Äì13 season yet again began with a Supercopa contention, this time another incarnation of El Cl√°sico. Barcelona would win the first leg at home 3‚Äì2 with goals from Messi, Pedro and Xavi, but in the second leg, despite a wonderfully-struck free kick from Messi from 35 yards out, Barcelona would succumb 2‚Äì1 to their fiercest foes with goals from Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higua√≠n. In La Liga, Barcelona would shoot straight up to the top of the league table with a 5‚Äì1 win over Real Sociedad. In the most-hyped game of the season so far, Barcelona and Real Madrid would play out what many regard as the best Cl√°sico in recent memory, ending in a 2‚Äì2 draw at the Camp Nou with both Messi and Ronaldo netting twice for their respective clubs. Bar√ßa would also kick of their Copa del Rey defence with a 3‚Äì0 win over Alav√©s. In the Champions League on 7 November 2012, Barcelona would fall 2‚Äì1 to Celtic, with Messi grabbing his third Champions League goal of the 2012‚Äì13 season in the 90th minute in Glasgow. Barcelona were eliminated from Europe 0‚Äì7 on aggregate in the semi-finals against eventual champions Bayern Munich, the worst-ever aggregate loss in any European competition for the club.  The Bartomeu Era (2014‚Äìpresent)  =2013‚Äì14 season= Neymar during his unveiling at Barcelona in June 2013. On 22 July 2013, Gerardo Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013‚Äì14 season. Barcelona's first official games under Martino were the home and away legs of the 2013 Supercopa de Espa√±a, which Bar√ßa won 1‚Äì1 on away goals. On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of the complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar. Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term in 2016. In April 2014, FIFA banned the club from buying players for the next two transfer windows following the violation of the FIFA's rules about the transfer of footballers aged under 18. A statement on FIFA's website read, \\"With regard to the case in question, FC Barcelona has been found to be in breach of art. 19 of the Regulations in the case of ten minor players and to have committed several other concurrent infringements in the context of other players, including under Annexe 2 of the Regulations. The Disciplinary Committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, together with a fine of CHF 450,000. Additionally, the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned.\\" FIFA rejected an appeal in August but the pending appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) allowed Barcelona to sign players during the summer of 2014.\\"Barcelona transfer ban appeal rejected by Court\\". BBC. Retrieved 30 December 2014 On 17 May, they played their final game of the season against Atl√©tico Madrid at the Camp Nou, needing a win in order to win the La Liga championship, while Atletico needed at least a draw in order to win their first league title since the 1995‚Äì96 season and their 10th overall. Barcelona were leading 1‚Äì0 at the 33rd minute after Alexis S√°nchez opened the scoreline, however Diego God√≠n headed an equaliser for Altetico in the 49th minute, drawing the game 1‚Äì1, and giving Atletico Madrid their 10th La Liga title. =2014‚Äì15 season= Luis Enrique managing Bar√ßa in 2014. On 19 May 2014, it was announced that Luis Enrique would return to Barcelona as head coach after he agreed to a two-year deal. He was recommended by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, his former Spain national teammate. Following Luis Enrique's arrival, Barcelona broke their transfer record when they paid Liverpool between ‚Ç¨81 to ‚Ç¨94 million for striker Luis Su√°rez, who at the time was serving a four-month ban from all football-related activity imposed by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee after biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during his appearance for Uruguay in a World Cup group stage match. In late December 2014, Barcelona's appeal to the CAS was unsuccessful and the original transfer ban was reinstated, leaving the club unable to utilise the 2015 winter and summer transfer windows. On 5 January 2015, Zubizareta was sacked by the board after 4 years as director of football.\\"Barcelona sack Andoni Zubizarreta as director of football\\". BBC. Retrieved 5 January 2015 On 12 February 2015, Barcelona announced the formation of a new Football Area Technical Commission, made up of vice-president Jordi Mestre, board member Javier Bordas, Carles Rexach and Ariedo Braida. Barcelona won the treble in the 2014‚Äì15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.\\"Johan Cruyff's influence endures as Barcelona complete the 'double-treble\\". ESPN. Retrieved 8 June 2015 On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atl√©tico Madrid. This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years. On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou. On 6 June, Barcelona won the Champions League final with a 3‚Äì1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years. = 2015‚Äì16 season = Barcelona started their 2015‚Äì16 season with a 5‚Äì4 win against 2014‚Äì15 UEFA Europa League winners, Sevilla, during the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. Spanish winger, Pedro, scored the winning goal for Bar√ßa after extra time during the 115th minute. Barcelona's performance in the 2015 Supercopa de Espa√±a, however, was not as exciting. In the first leg against Athletic Bilbao in San Mam√©s Stadium, Bilbao, Barcelona lost 4‚Äì0 to Ernesto Valverde's Athletic side, with Aritz Aduriz scoring 3 goals in 15 minutes for the Basque outfit. Three days later, during the second leg at the Camp Nou, Barcelona and Bilbao held a 1‚Äì1 draw, meaning Athletic Bilbao won 5‚Äì1 on aggregate. Despite the departures of Pedro and Xavi, each of whom went to English club, Chelsea, and Qatari side, Al Sadd, respectively, Barcelona were able to defend their league title, with a 3‚Äì0 win over Granada at the final day of season. Uruguayan striker, Luis Su√°rez, scored all 3 goals of the match, as the win put them one point above their El Cl√°sico rivals, securing the title. Barcelona also won the 2015‚Äì16 Copa del Rey with a 2‚Äì0 win against Sevilla in the final. Barcelona also won the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup, with a 3‚Äì0 win against Argentine club, River Plate, in the final. In the UEFA Champions League, Barcelona finished at the top of their group stage, without losing once. During the knockout rounds, Barcelona started with a 5‚Äì1 aggregate win over English side, Arsenal in the Round of 16. During the quarter-finals, however, they were knocked out by Atl√©tico Madrid, after a 0‚Äì2 loss at the Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium, making them lose 2‚Äì3 on aggregate. Ernesto Valverde was the manager of Athletic Bilbao during the 2015 Supercopa de Espa√±a. He would eventually manage Barcelona following Luis Enrique's departure. = 2016‚Äì17 season = On 27 June 2016, Brazilian right-back, Dani Alves left Barcelona for Juventus on a free transfer, and on 25 August 2016, Manchester City announced that they had signed Chilean goalkeeper, Claudio Bravo, from Barcelona, who started for Barcelona during the 2015 Champions League Final. Bravo also played as goalkeeper during all 180 minutes of their 5‚Äì0 aggregate victory in the 2016 Supercopa de Espa√±a against Sevilla. During the summer transfer window, Barcelona notably signed Samuel Umtiti from Lyon, and Paco Alc√°cer from Valencia. They also signed Dutch goalie, Jasper Cillessen from Ajax, as a back-up goalkeeper to Marc-Andr√© ter Stegen. Barcelona were able to win the 2016‚Äì17 Copa del Rey, after they defeated Deportivo Alav√©s 3‚Äì1 in the final. They weren't able to defend their league, however, as they finished 3 points behind Real Madrid. Their last loss during that league season was a 0‚Äì2 away defeat to M√°laga. Barcelona's campaign in Europe was a different story. Their first game in the 2016‚Äì17 UEFA Champions League was a 7‚Äì0 thrashing of Celtic in the group stage; three of those goals came from Lionel Messi. Barcelona finished at the top of the group with 15 points, and their only loss in the group stage was a 1‚Äì3 loss to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. In the round of 16, Barcelona was drawn against French club, Paris-Saint Germain. In the first leg, they shocking lost 4‚Äì0 at the Parc des Princes in France. More shocking, in the second leg, Barcelona won 6‚Äì1 against the French outfit, meaning the Catalan club won 6‚Äì5 on aggregate and progressed to the quarterfinals. The match was dubbed by the Spanish media and FC Barcelona fans as \\"La Remontada\\" (Spanish for \\"The Comeback\\"). Despite this, Barcelona were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Juventus, losing 0‚Äì3 on aggregate following a 0‚Äì0 draw at the Camp Nou. = 2017‚Äìpresent = On 1 March 2017, Luis Enrique announced that he would be leaving Barcelona at the end of that season following their 6‚Äì1 win against Sporting Gij√≥n. On 29 May 2017, FC Barcelona announced that Ernesto Valverde would be the new manager of the club. Luis Enrique wasn't the only significant person to leave Barcelona during the summer of 2017. Brazilian star, Neymar, who scored 2 goals against Paris Saint-Germain during their 6‚Äì1 \\"remontada\\", left for the French side for a world record ‚Ç¨222 million fee. As a replacement, Barcelona signed French striker, Ousmane Demb√©l√© from Borussia Dortmund for ‚Ç¨105 million. During the 2017‚Äì18 winter transfer window, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool, and sold Javier Mascherano to Chinese Super League outfit, Hebei China Fortune. Barcelona's first game of the 2017‚Äì18 season was a 1‚Äì3 loss to Real Madrid in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de Espa√±a at the Camp Nou. Three days later, they would lose 0‚Äì2 at the Bernab√©u, meaning that they would ironically lose 5‚Äì1 on aggregate. Despite this, Barcelona won the Double and won both La Liga and the Copa del Rey. During the league season, they almost went unbeaten, losing only once in La Liga during their penultimate game of the season against Levante at the Estadi Ciutat de Val√®ncia. They won the 2018 Copa del Rey Final at the Wanda Metropolitano with a 5‚Äì0 victory over Sevilla. Barcelona were also knocked out in the 2017‚Äì18 UEFA Champions League during the quarter-finals by Roma, following a 3‚Äì0 loss at the Stadio Olimpico, meaning the two-legged tie was tied 4‚Äì4, but Roma won on away goals. The 2017‚Äì18 was Andr√©s Iniesta's last season at FC Barcelona, as he decided to leave the club for J.League side Vissel Kobe. As a replacement, Barcelona signed Chilean midfielder, Arturo Vidal from Bayern Munich. Barcelona won their first game of the 2018‚Äì19 season, the 2018 Supercopa de Espa√±a against Sevilla, at the Stade Ibn Batouta in Morocco. It was the first Supercopa de Espa√±a to be held outside of Spain. Barcelona also secured their 26th La Liga title during the 2018‚Äì19 season, following a 1‚Äì0 win against Levante at the Camp Nou, with three games remaining in the season. However, they were knocked out of the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Champions League in the semi-finals by Liverpool. For the second consecutive years, Barcelona was eliminated with a 3-goal first-leg lead. They won the first leg 3‚Äì0 at the Camp Nou, however, Liverpool won 4‚Äì0 during the second leg at Anfield, meaning that the Scousers won 4‚Äì3 on aggregate, and progressed to the final, which they won. Barcelona also lost the 2019 Copa del Rey Final, with a 1‚Äì2 loss to Valencia at the Estadio Benito Villamar√≠n in Seville.

Jason‚Äôs wife, Monica, pregnant at the time, recounts that she froze. \\"Everything completely stopped. I forgot all about [my] pregnancy. I think I left my body. I remember thinking, this cannot be true. I cannot go on without Jason\\". Days passed, and Jason‚Äôs family was forced to accept the new dark reality at hand. But they refused to accept the dark future described by doubtful doctors. So in the face of wrenching despair and horrifying odds, the Criglers made a resolution, \\"Jason will make a full recovery\\".

CAST conducts research and analysis on Russian conventional arms trade, Russia's defense industry, military conflicts, Russian military reform, and international defense trends. Although it is primarily focused on Russia and the former Soviet Republics, CAST has also written reports and books on the defense industries of China, India, Turkey, and many European nations. CAST publishes two journals, the English language Moscow Defense Brief and Russian language Eksport Vooruzheniy, and the daily Russia media digest Periscope. In addition, CAST has written a number of books, including the critically acclaimed Tanks of August, Russia's New Army, and Brothers Armed: Military Aspects of the Crisis in Ukraine. CAST also runs the popular Russian language blogs Periscope 2 and BMPD, which provide daily articles on Russian and international defense news. CAST offers consultation, analysis, and information services to Russian government agencies, defense industry companies, banks, and investment institutions. Although it has conducted research projects for the Russian government, CAST is a privately owned and operated company, and all of its revenue is derived from research and media products, consultation services and other projects.  Overview  CAST was founded in the summer of 1997 by Ruslan Pukhov and Konstantin Makienko. Pukhov and Makienko both attended the Franco-Russian dual-degree program between Master d'Etudes Internationales Sciences Po and MGIMO in Paris where Makienko interned at the French defense think tank Centre for Study of Strategies and Technologies (CREST), which is now the Foundation for Strategic Research. After returning to Russia and initially working as researchers at the Center for Policy Studies in Russia (PIR Center), Pukhov and Makienko decided to establish CAST with CREST as their inspiration. CAST today employs approximately ten full-time researchers with many additional analysts working part-time. The Centre's researchers collaborate on an ad hoc basis with leading Russian experts, journalists, defense specialists and civil servants working on similar issues. Pukhov serves as the director, Makienko as the deputy director, and Maksim Shepovalenko, a retired career Russian naval officer, also as deputy director. In addition to his work at CAST, Pukhov is member of the Public Council of the Russian Ministry of Defense and the former executive director of the Russian Armorers Union. Since 2008, Makienko has served as a member of the expert council under the Russian Duma defense committee. = Major publications = Since 1997, CAST has been publishing the Russian language journal Eksport Vooruzheniy (Arms Export) on arms trade and defense industries issues, '. CAST typically publishes 6 editions of Eksport Vooruzheniy each year, and it contains a comprehensive list of all the open- source Russian arms sales and military procurement decisions for each year. Till 2018 CAST also published the English language Moscow Defense Brief (MDB), which was aimed to provide and analysis of trends in Russian defense policy and industry for professionals in the English-speaking world. CAST maintains an electronic archive of all previously published Moscow Defense Brief on its website. CAST also publishes the comprehensive daily digest Periscope, which compiles all of the news on Russia's military, defense industry, arms sales, and defense policy from Russian and foreign media sources. CAST has published a variety of books, in both English and Russian, on a variety of defense topics. These books, which are often released soon after the events occur, provide an informed Russian perspective on defense issues and developments. In 2008, CAST released the Russian language book Military-Technical Cooperation between Russia and Foreign Countries: A Market Analysis, which gave a detailed analysis of the global arms market and Russia's position within it. CAST published the definitive account of the five-day war between Russia and Georgia in South Ossetia in The Tanks of August soon after the conflict ended. Their next book Russia's New Army, which was published in both Russian and English, detailed the radical reforms undertaken by Russia Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov. CAST's next two books, both in Russian, Alien War and World of Khaki: Armed Forces in the System of State Power, analyzed armed conflicts since 1991 and the role of the military in the political affairs of a number of countries, including Pakistan, Turkey, and Algeria, respectively. The last two Russian language books from CAST were The Defense Industry and Arms Trade of China and Radio-electronic Warfare: From Experiments of the past to the Future Decisive Front. They also published two editions of the English language Brothers Armed: Military Aspects of the Crisis in Ukraine, which analyzed Russia's military operation in Crimea and the ongoing conflict in the Donbass. In October, 2016, CAST released the second edition of the Russian- language book The Syrian Frontier edited by Maxim Shepovalenko. The book examines the history of Russia's relationship with Syria, and it details the conduct of Russia's military intervention in Syria beginning in September 2015. The second edition features a foreword by the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, Sergey Shoygu, and an afterword by the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov.http://cast.ru/news/vyshlo-vtoroe-izdanie- knigi-siriyskiy-rubezh.html On December 21, 2016, CAST published the Russian- language book The Defense Industry and Military-Technical Cooperation with Foreign States of India.http://cast.ru/news/zavershena-rabota-nad-novoy- knigoy-tsentra-ast-ob-indii.html In 2017 the Centre published Turkish Military Machine: Strengths and Weaknesses. The book examines the Turkish defense industry, the defense budget, the Turkish officer class as a social institution, and its recent military history. http://cast.ru/books/turetskaya- voennaya-mashina-sila-i-slabost.html CAST has also recently published two books, one in Russian and the other in English, on international Special Operations Forces. The first, Between War and Peace: Special Operations Forces is in Russian, and it provides a detailed description of the Special Operations Forces of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Turkey, Israel, Iran, China, and Colombia. It features a foreword from the Director of \\"Helicopters of Russia\\", and it is edited by Mikhail Barabanov.http://cast.ru/news/tsentr-ast-vypustil-knigu-mezhdu-mirom- i-voynoy-sily-spetsialnykh-operatsiy.html The second book, which will be released in 2017, is called Elite Warriors: Special Operations Forces From Around the World.

It is the world's largest manufacturer and supplier of sound and vibration measurement equipment, systems and solutions.A Br√ºel & Kj√¶r History Lesson - Short Version ' by Svend Gade, published in Sound and Vibration, August 2008. Br√ºel & Kj√¶r is a subsidiary of Spectris.  Founders  Br√ºel & Kj√¶r was founded by Per Vilhelm Br√ºel (6 March 1915 ‚Äì 2 April 2015) and Viggo Kj√¶r (5 June 1914 ‚Äì 25 July 2013) on 28 November 1942. The two men met while studying at The Polytechnic School in Copenhagen (now the Technical University of Denmark). After receiving their M.S. degrees in 1939 they decided to start a company developing instruments for acoustic measurements. Holger Nielsen joined the company as third partner in 1945, and was with the company until his death in 1978. Br√ºel & Kj√¶r's Headquarters in N√¶rum - Denmark  Products  The most notable products and technologies developed by the company include: *1940s ‚Äì Precision measurement instruments including radio frequency analysers and Geiger counters. Type 2401, a vacuum tube voltmeter, was the first instrument produced. Type 4301, launched in 1943, was the world's first charge accelerometer, while Type 2301 marked the success of the company in 1949. Since then it has been updated a number of times: the latest version, Type 2307, was introduced in 1972. *1950s ‚Äì Sound and vibration measurements tools, including logarithmic level recorders, signal generators and frequency analyzers. *1960s ‚Äì Measurement microphones, preamplifiers and calibrators, along with IEC standardised precision sound level meters. *1970s ‚Äì Parallel analyzers, including the first analyzer using digital filters. *1980s ‚Äì The first instrument for sound intensity measurement; dual channel FFT analyzers. *1990s ‚Äì Multichannel and multi-analysis systems, including acoustical holography array systems. *2000s ‚Äì Surface microphones, LAN-XI modular data acquisition hardware and TEDS, Dyn-X, REq-X technologies. Markets = Aero engines = Br√ºel & Kjaer delivers technologies for the Sikorsky MH-60R which was chosen by the RDAF as replacement for the Lynx helicopter in 2012 Br√ºel & Kj√¶r provides tools to overcome noise and vibration challenges. These ensure the quality of new lighter material applications by modal testing and improving the quality and test efficiency in aero engines. Systems include those for development and measurement of new noise-optimised engines, acoustic lining designs and propagation code validation (engine duct modal analysis, far-field noise measurement, and acoustic panel in situ impedance measurement) It also supplies in-flight engine monitoring with flight-certified, high- temperature accelerometers. = Aerospace = NASA's Mars rover 'Curiosity' was tested using a Br√ºel and Kj√¶r LDS shaker system Br√ºel & Kj√¶r supplies data acquisition systems and vibration test systems (LDS) to customers in the aerospace industry, such as the LDS V994 shaker, used to test NASA's Mars Curiosity rover. Other systems have tested Astrium's satellite prior to launch, and performed qualification and acceptance testing, such as the integrated LAN-XI data acquisition systems used by the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil INPE. Main customers in this field are Airbus, Aircraft Strength Research Institute, Boeing, EADS, Eurocopter, Rolls Royce, and Sukhoi. =Defence= Acoustic stealth discretion The company supplies systems for noise signature management: acoustic ranging of submarines and surface ships; noise source investigation during design and build; acoustic trials and self-noise monitoring during operations. It also supplies systems for underwater acoustics, shock testing, noise and vibration testing and structural dynamics testing. Identifying noise sources Br√ºel & Kj√¶r offers products covering a wide range of acoustic customer- oriented solutions, ranging from simple sound level measurements to sophisticated microphone array systems using advanced algorithms and hardware. These solutions are provided for air-vehicle noise certification, exterior noise analysis such as fly-over testing using acoustic holography, beamforming, SONAH and high-temperature sensors, noise source identification to examine e.g., ramp noise or sonic booms, microphone calibration systems and more. Maintaining operational integrity The company provides products that aid preventative maintenance and manufacturer-specified checks to prolong the health of engines. Real-time multi-analysis capabilities reduce the number of run‚Äëups/‚Äëdowns and gather more data faster for analyses ranging from simple pass-fail overall measurements to in-depth advanced analysis in order to maximize the up-time of aircraft. It offers high-temperature accelerometers that can monitor the health of operational machinery and provides solutions for maintenance, repair and overhaul tasks such as balancing, trim balancing, on-ground engine vibration checks, vibration diagnostics and re-run production tests using real-time analysis. Furthermore, it provides monitoring systems for engines and gearboxes with permanently placed HUMS sensors and signal conditioners for extreme environments. Environmental noise impact testing and monitoring Br√ºel & Kj√¶r supplies systems for occupational health, helmet/cabin/cockpit noise assessment, acoustic and human vibration monitoring, urban noise monitoring and noise-mapping of vehicles in order to test and monitor the environmental noise impact, and to look for ways of reducing environmental noise impact on armed forces personnel and local communities. These activities include helmet/cabin/cockpit noise assessment, human acoustic and vibration monitoring, urban, airport, industrial and construction noise monitoring, and vehicle noise mapping. Wind tunnel testing Since wind tunnel and test track measurements are often the only way to recreate real-world conditions for model and mule car testing, and are also a good method of validating simulated model data, Br√ºel & Kj√¶r tries to provide measurement devices that focus on these types of tests, providing specialised solutions for specific needs so that they can perform vehicle pass-by noise contribution studies for cars, trucks and trains, location of high-frequency engine noise sources, and wind-tunnel measurements. Surface microphones mounted on the exterior of a vehicle measure the pressure fluctuations at different positions of the vehicle without drilling holes. Beamforming can be used for noise mapping at a distance from large objects. The data for all points is acquired in a single measurement, saving time and effort. Setting targets Trains and ground vehicles are also a major market for Br√ºel & Kj√¶r Br√ºel & Kj√¶r's sound quality solutions provide the tools for recording, analysing, auditioning, dissecting, and synthesising sounds.

It is one of the most modern stadia in Saxony-Anhalt.  Overview  Eight peace doves heralded the opening of the Paul Greifzu Stadium in Dessau in October 1952. It was named after German motorsport racer and constructor Paul Greifzu who had died in a training accident in Dessau in May that same year. The stadium had been built by voluntary work on dozens of tons of rubble from the ruins of Dessau. Altogether, 51,000 hours of work were spent to construct a 35,000 capacity stadium. It soon became a location for regional athletics championships. During the GDR era, little was done for the maintenance and preservation of the stadium. Only after German reunification, in the mid-1990s, did the city of Dessau develop plans for the remodeling of the stadium. In several steps the complex as renovated and expanded. An important innovation was the construction of complete facilities for track and field athletics. Had athletes had to be content with a cinder track, they now found a modern running track providing optimal conditions for competitions. The facilities were completed by providing for other disciplines, such as shot put, javelin throw, high jump, pole vault and discus throw. The first test for the new facilities came in 1998, when Great Britain, France and Germany U23 teams competed in track and field there. Just a little later floodlights were installed with an illumination rating of 1,825 lux, one of the highest-rated floodlights in Germany. In 2002 a new west stand was constructed that provides for 2,048 covered seats. The last step of renovation to date was the construction of changing rooms and other operational facilities below the east stand, but further ideas for remodeling the complex exist. Altogether 6.7 million Euros have been invested in the stadium since 1996, turning it into one of the most modern stadia in Central Germany. Entrance on Ludwigshafener Stra√üe Every year the Anhalt-Meeting is held in the Paul Greifzu Stadium, regarded as one of the best outdoor meetings in Europe by athletes such as Franka Dietzsch or Tim Lobinger. It is also the home of LAC Dessau, the local track and field athletics club. A number of major football teams have played in the stadium, such as FC Bayern Munich in a DFB-Pokal match against TSV V√∂lpke in DFB-Pokal 2004‚Äì05 and a friendly against SV Dessau 05 in 2005. Leeds United A.F.C and Atl√©tico Madrid played friendlies against FC Energie Cottbus in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Several matches of the now defunct DFB- Ligapokal were also held in Dessau, as well as several finals of the East German Cup, the FDGB-Pokal.

Together with Milko Kos, Fran Zwitter, and Vasilij Melik, he was one of the founders of the so-called Ljubljana school of historiography.  Early life  He was born in Ljubljana in a well-established Carinthian Slovene family. His father, Ivan Grafenauer, was a famous literary historian and ethnologist and nephew of Franc Grafenauer, a representative in the Carinthian provincial assembly. He was the brother of the mineralogist Stanko Grafenauer and designer and choreographer Marija Grafenauer-Vogelnik. He studied history at the University of Ljubljana, graduating in 1940. In his college years, he joined the Christian left intellectual circle around Edvard Kocbek. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he joined the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. Between 1942 and 1943, the Italian Fascist occupation authorities interned him in the Gonars concentration camp. Nevertheless, he managed to complete his PhD dissertation in 1944 under the supervision of the medievalist Milko Kos.  Career  Grafenauer started publishing already in the late 1930s. In his academic career, Grafenauer focused on social history in the Middle Ages. He continued the researches of Milko Kos on settlements patterns in the Slovene Lands in the early middle ages, focusing on the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps and the medieval Slavic principality of Carantania. He wrote several treatises on the transition between tribal and feudal socio-economic forms in the Eastern Alps and the west Balkans. His main contribution was however the history of the German Peasants' Wars in the late 15th and 16th century in the Slovene Lands and in Croatia. He also wrote on the history of the Slovenes in Carinthia in the 19th and 20th centuries, and on agricultural modernization in the early 19th century. Since the 1950s and 1960s, he was among those who introduced the approaches of the French Annales school in the Yugoslav historiography. Between 1945 and 1955, he wrote several expert surveys on border areas in Carinthia and the Julian March for the Yugoslav diplomacy. From 1946 to 1982, he taught Slovene medieval history and theory of historiography at the University of Ljubljana. In 1972, he became a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He was also a member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts and the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Between 1978 and 1987, he served as president of the publishing house Slovenska matica; during his presidency, Grafenauer hired several prominent external collaborators, some of whom (like Ivo Urbanƒçiƒç, Tine Hribar and Drago Janƒçar) had been persecuted by the Communist regime, raising the quality and reputation of the institution. In the last decade of his life, Grafenauer rose to prominence again with his resolute fight against autochthonist re-interpretations of Slovenian history, especially against the populist Venetic theory, which denied the Slavic settlement in the East Alps. Bogo Grafenauer died in Ljubljana and was buried in the ≈Ωale cemetery. His daughter, Darja Miheliƒç, is also a historian.

Originally a patronymic, Owen became a fixed surname in Wales beginning with the reign of Henry VIII. Etymologists consider it to originate from Eugene meaning 'noble- born'. According to T. J. Morgan and Prys Morgan in Welsh Surnames: \\"the name is a derivation of the Latin > OW , ... variously written in MW as , , . LL gives the names , , , . The corresponding form in Irish is .\\" Morgan and Morgan note that there are less likely alternative explanations, and agree with Rachel Bromwich that Welsh \\"is normally latinised as \\", and that both the Welsh and Irish forms are Latin derivatives. The Welsh name is a cognate and near-homonym of the Irish name (pronounced /'oÀê…ôun/, partially anglicised as , as noted by Morgan and Morgan, among other spellings). As such, the given name Owney is usually regarded as a diminutive of either Owen or Eoghan. However, another Irish name, (/Ààu…ôn ≤…ô/, meaning 'wood', 'work', 'pillar', or 'harmony') has also sometimes been anglicised as Owney. Owen can also be an anglicised form of the French name , as in the case of Ouen of Rouen, metropolitan bishop of Rouen, known in Latin as , from Germanic and with French variant form . The anglicisation of the French digraph ou to ow is common in words such as > coward, and Old French > power, > tower, etc. Welsh has sometimes been latinised as in certain parish registers, through a folk etymology process, because both and / have a typical anglicised form of Owen.

Vinter was born in Lincoln. As a youth, he was a chorister at Lincoln Cathedral, and eventually became Head Chorister there. He later became a bassoonist. In 1930, he joined the BBC Military Band, where he did much of his early conducting. It was during that time that he also began to compose. During World War II, Vinter played in The Central Band of the RAF and later led several other RAF bands. He was the first principal conductor of the BBC Concert Orchestra, from 1952 to 1953. In 1960, The Daily Herald newspaper and sponsors of brass band contests, commissioned Vinter to write his first major work for brass band, the result of which was Salute to Youth. Vinter wrote other works for brass band, including: {valign=\\"top\\"* Challenging Brass (1966) * Variations on a Ninth (1964) * The Trumpets (1964) * Triumphant Rhapsody (1965) * Centenary March (1968) * Dover Coach (1964) * Portuguese Party (1965) * Symphony of Marches (1963) valign=\\"top\\"* John O'Gaunt (1967) * James Cook - Circumnavigator (1968) * Spectrum (1969) * Salute to Youth (1961) * Entertainments (1968 for Brass Band) * Lisbon Carnival (1965) * Simon Called Peter (1963) * Vizcaya (1967) } Vinter was an adjudicator at the British Open Championships at Belle Vue, Manchester, in 1969 where his 'Spectrum' was the test piece. Mid way through the contest, however, he was forced to retire from 'the box' due to his failing health. His position at the contest on the day was taken by Tom F Atkinson. Vinter's other works include three brass quartets: * Elegy and Rondo (written at the request of the GUS (Footwear) Band Quartet to play at the 1966 National Brass Quartet Championship) * Fancy's Knell (written for the 1967 Championship) * Alla Burlesca (written for the 1968 Championship).

A self-described \\"non-musician\\", Eno has helped introduce unique conceptual approaches and recording techniques to contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures. Born in Suffolk, Eno studied painting and experimental music at the art school of Ipswich Civic College in the mid 1960s, and then at Winchester School of Art. He joined glam rock group Roxy Music as synthesizer player in 1971, recording two albums with the group but departing in 1973 amidst tensions with Roxy frontman Bryan Ferry. Eno went on to record a number of solo albums beginning with Here Come the Warm Jets (1974). In the mid-1970s, he began exploring a minimalist direction on releases such as Discreet Music (1975) and Ambient 1: Music for Airports (1978), coining the term \\"ambient music\\" with the latter. Alongside his solo work, Eno collaborated frequently with other musicians in the 1970s, including Robert Fripp, Harmonia, Cluster, Harold Budd, David Bowie, and David Byrne. He also established himself as a sought-after producer, working on albums by John Cale, Jon Hassell, Laraaji, Talking Heads, Ultravox, and Devo, as well as the no wave compilation No New York (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums and produce for other artists, most prominently U2 and Coldplay, alongside work with artists such as Daniel Lanois, Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, Slowdive, Karl Hyde, James, Kevin Shields, and Damon Albarn. Dating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including sound installations, film, and writing. In the mid-1970s, he co- developed Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards featuring aphorisms intended to spur creative thinking. From the 1970s onwards, Eno's installations have included the sails of the Sydney Opera House in 2009 and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, Eno writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the Long Now Foundation. In 2019, Eno was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music. Early life Eno was born on 15 May 1948 at Phyllis Memorial Hospital in Melton, Suffolk, the son of Catholic parents William Arnold Eno (1916‚Äì1988), who followed his father and grandfather into the postal service, and his Belgian wife Maria Alphonsine Eno (n√©e Buslot; 1922‚Äì2005), whom William had met during his service in World War II. The unusual surname Eno, long established in Suffolk, is thought to derive from the French Huguenot surname Hainault in today's Belgium. Maria already had a daughter (Brian's half-sister Rita), and together William and Maria would have two further children: Roger (born 1959) and Arlette (born 1961). Eno was educated at St Joseph's College, Ipswich, founded by the De La Salle Brothers order of Catholic brothers (from which on his confirmation he took the name St. John le Baptiste de la Salle). Subsequently, Eno studied with new media artist Roy Ascott on the Groundcourse at the art school at Ipswich Civic College before going onto Winchester School of Art, from which he graduated in 1969. At Winchester School of Art, Eno attended a lecture by Pete Townshend of The Who (also an ex-student of Roy Ascott) and cites that lecture as the moment he realised he could make music despite lacking a formal musical education and his ongoing hobby of pigeon fancying preoccupying his energies. Whilst at school, Eno used a tape recorder as a musical instrument and experimented with his first, sometimes improvisational, bands. St. Joseph's College teacher and painter Tom Phillips encouraged him, recalling \\"Piano Tennis\\" with Eno, in which, after collecting pianos, they stripped and aligned them in a hall, striking them with tennis balls. From that collaboration, he became involved in Cornelius Cardew's Scratch Orchestra. The first released recording in which Eno appears is the Deutsche Grammophon edition of Cardew's The Great Learning (recorded February 1971), as one of the voices in the recital of Paragraph 7 of The Great Learning. Another early recording was the Berlin Horse soundtrack, by Malcolm Le Grice, a nine-minute, 2 √ó 16mm-double- projection, released in 1970 and presented in 1971. Career =1970s= Eno's professional music career began in London when he became a founder member (1971‚Äì1973) of the glam/art rock band Roxy Music. Initially Eno did not appear on stage at their live shows, but operated the mixing desk, processing the band's sound with a VCS3 synthesiser and tape recorders, and singing backing vocals. He did, however, eventually appear on stage as a performing member of the group, usually flamboyantly costumed. He quit the band on completing the promotional tour for the band's second album, For Your Pleasure, because of disagreements with lead singer Bryan Ferry and boredom with the rock star life. In 1992, he described his Roxy Music tenure as important to his career: \\"As a result of going into a subway station and meeting [saxophonist Andy Mackay], I joined Roxy Music, and, as a result of that, I have a career in music. If I'd walked ten yards further on the platform, or missed that train, or been in the next carriage, I probably would have been an art teacher now\\". During his period with Roxy Music, and for his first three solo albums, he was credited on records only as 'Eno'. Eno appearing on Dutch television (1974) Eno embarked on a solo career almost immediately. Between 1973 and 1977, he created four albums of electronically inflected art pop: Here Come the Warm Jets (1973), Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) (1974), Another Green World (1975), and Before and After Science (1977). Tiger Mountain contains the galloping \\"Third Uncle\\", one of Eno's best-known songs, owing in part to its later being covered by Bauhaus and 801. Critic Dave Thompson writes that the song is \\"a near punk attack of riffing guitars and clattering percussion, 'Third Uncle' could, in other hands, be a heavy metal anthem, albeit one whose lyrical content would tongue-tie the most slavish air guitarist.\\" These four albums were remastered and reissued in 2004 by Virgin's Astralwerks label. Due to Eno's decision not to add any extra tracks of the original material, a handful of tracks originally issued as singles have not been reissued, including the single mix of \\"King's Lead Hat\\", the title of which is an anagram of \\"Talking Heads\\", whilst \\"Seven Deadly Finns\\" and \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" were included on the deleted Eno Box II: Vocal. During this period, Eno also played three dates with Phil Manzanera in the band 801, a \\"supergroup\\" that performed more or less reworked selections from albums by Eno, Manzanera, and Quiet Sun, as well as covers of songs by the Beatles (\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\") and the Kinks (\\"You Really Got Me\\"). In 1967, Eno developed a tape delay system. The technique involved two Revox tape recorders set up side by side, with the tape unspooling from the first deck being carried over to the second deck to be spooled. This enabled sound recorded on the first deck to be played back by the second deck at a time delay that varied with the distance between the two decks and the speed of the tape (typically a few seconds). Working with Robert Fripp (from King Crimson) the pair used this system in their collaboration (No Pussyfooting) (1973). Subsequently, Fripp referred to this method as \\"Frippertronics\\". In 1975, Fripp and Eno released a second album, Evening Star, and played several live shows in Europe. Eno was a prominent member of the performance art-classical orchestra the Portsmouth Sinfonia ‚Äì having started playing clarinet with them in 1972. In 1973, he produced the orchestra's first album The Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics (released in March 1974) and in 1974, he produced the live album Hallelujah! The Portsmouth Sinfonia Live at the Royal Albert Hall, a recording of their infamous May 1974 concert (released in October 1974). In addition to producing both albums, Eno performed in the orchestra on both recordings playing the clarinet. Eno also deployed the orchestra's famously dissonant string section on his second solo album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy). The orchestra at this time included other musicians whose solo work he would subsequently release on his Obscure label including Gavin Bryars and Michael Nyman. That year he also composed music for the album Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy, with Kevin Ayers, to accompany the poet June Campbell Cramer.  Ambient music  Eno released a number of eclectic ambient electronic and acoustic albums. He coined the term \\"ambient music\\",{Prendergast, The Ambient Century: p.93} which is designed to modify the listener's perception of the surrounding environment. In the liner notes accompanying Ambient 1: Music for Airports, Eno wrote: \\"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\\"{(PVC7908(AMB001)} Eno was hit by a taxi while crossing the street in January 1975 and spent several weeks recuperating at home. His girlfriend brought him an old record of harp music, which he lay down to listen to. He realized that he had set the amplifier to a very low volume, and one channel of the stereo was not working, but he lacked the energy to get up and correct it. \\"This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music ‚Äì as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and sound of the rain were parts of the ambience.\\" Eno's first work of ambient music was Discreet Music (1975), again created with an elaborate tape-delay methodology which he diagrammed on the back cover of the LP; it is considered the landmark album of the genre. This was followed by his Ambient series: Music for Airports (Ambient 1), The Plateaux of Mirror (Ambient 2) featuring Harold Budd on keyboard, Day of Radiance (Ambient 3) with American composer Laraaji playing zither and hammered dulcimer, and On Land (Ambient 4)). =1980s= In 1980, Eno provided a film score for Herbert Vesely's Egon Schiele ‚Äì Exzess und Bestrafung, also known as Egon Schiele ‚Äì Excess and Punishment. The ambient-style score was an unusual choice for an historical piece, but it worked effectively with the film's themes of sexual obsession and death. Before Eno made On Land, Robert Quine played him Miles Davis' \\"He Loved Him Madly\\" (1974). Eno stated in the liner notes for On Land, \\"Teo Macero's revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the \\"spacious\\" quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film Amarcord, it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently.\\" In 1980 to 1981, during which time Eno travelled to Ghana for a festival of West African music, he was collaborating with David Byrne of Talking Heads. Their album My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, was built around radio broadcasts Eno collected whilst living in the United States, along with sampled music recordings from around the world transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and Middle Eastern rhythms. In 1983, Eno collaborated with his brother, Roger Eno, and Daniel Lanois on the album Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks that had been commissioned by Al Reinert for his film For All Mankind (1989). Tracks from the album were subsequently used in several other films, including Trainspotting. =1990s= In September 1992, Eno released Nerve Net, an album utilising heavily syncopated rhythms with contributions from several former collaborators including Fripp, Benmont Tench, Robert Quine and John Paul Jones. This album was a last-minute substitution for My Squelchy Life, which contained more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals. Several tracks from My Squelchy Life later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set Eno Box II: Vocals, and the entire album was eventually released in 2014 as part of an expanded re-release of Nerve Net. Eno also released The Shutov Assembly in 1992, recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces atonality and abandons most conventional concepts of modes, scales and pitch. Emancipated from the constant attraction towards the tonic that underpins the Western tonal tradition, the gradually shifting music originally eschewed any conventional instrumentation, save for treated keyboards. During the 1990s, Eno worked increasingly with self-generating musical systems, the results of which he called generative music. This allows the listener to hear music that slowly unfolds in almost infinite non-repeating combinations of sound.The Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music pp118-119 Ed. Nick Collins () In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno achieves this through the blending of several independent musical tracks of varying length. Each track features different musical elements and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again re-configuring differently with the other tracks. He has presented this music in his own art and sound installations and those in collaboration with other artists, including I Dormienti (The Sleepers), Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace, Music for Civic Recovery Centre, The Quiet Room, and Music for Prague. In 1993, Eno worked with the Manchester rock band James to produce two albums, Laid and Wah Wah. Laid was met with notable critical and commercial success both in the UK and the United States after its release in 1993. Wah Wah, in comparison, received a more lukewarm response after its release in 1994. One of Eno's better-known collaborations was with the members of U2, Luciano Pavarotti and several other artists in a group called Passengers. They produced the 1995 album Original Soundtracks 1, which reached No. 76 on the US Billboard charts and No. 12 in the UK Albums Chart. It featured a single, \\"Miss Sarajevo\\", which reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. This collaboration is chronicled in Eno's book A Year with Swollen Appendices, a diary published in 1996. In 1996, Eno scored the six-part fantasy television series Neverwhere. =2000s= In 2004, Fripp and Eno recorded another ambient music collaboration album, The Equatorial Stars. Eno returned in June 2005 with Another Day on Earth, his first major album since Wrong Way Up (with John Cale) to prominently feature vocals (a trend he continued with Everything That Happens Will Happen Today). The album differs from his 1970s solo work due to the impact technological advances on musical production, evident in its semi- electronic production. In early 2006, Eno collaborated with David Byrne again, for the reissue of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts in celebration of the influential album's 25th anniversary. Eight previously unreleased tracks recorded during the initial sessions in 1980/81, were added to the album. An unusual interactive marketing strategy was employed for its re-release, the album's promotional website features the ability for anyone to officially and legally download the multi-tracks of two songs from the album, \\"A Secret Life\\" and \\"Help Me Somebody\\". This allowed listeners to remix and upload new mixes of these tracks to the website for others to listen and rate them. Eno at the Long Now Foundation, 26 June 2006 In late 2006, Eno released 77 Million Paintings, a program of generative video and music specifically for home computers. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77 million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched. Likewise, the accompanying music is generated by the program so that it's almost certain the listener will never hear the same arrangement twice. The second edition of \\"77 Million Paintings\\" featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound was released on 14 January 2008. In June 2007, when commissioned in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, California, Annabeth Robinson (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated 77 Million Paintings in Second Life. In 2007, Eno's music was featured in a movie adaption of Irvine Welsh's best-selling collection Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance. He also appeared playing keyboards in Voila, Belinda Carlisle's solo album sung entirely in French. Also in 2007, Eno contributed a composition titled \\"Grafton Street\\" to Dido's third album, Safe Trip Home, released in November 2008.Aizlewood, John. \\"In The Studio\\" . Q Magazine. October 2007. In 2008, he released Everything That Happens Will Happen Today with David Byrne, designed the sound for the video game Spore and wrote a chapter to Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture, edited by Paul D. Miller (a.k.a. DJ Spooky). In June 2009, Eno curated the Luminous Festival at Sydney Opera House, culminating in his first live appearance in many years. \\"Pure Scenius\\" consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Australian improvisation trio The Necks, Karl Hyde from Underworld, electronic artist Jon Hopkins and guitarist Leo Abrahams. Eno scored the music for Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lovely Bones, released in December 2009. =2010s= Eno at MoogFest 2011 Eno released another solo album on Warp in late 2010. Small Craft on a Milk Sea, made in association with long-time collaborators Leo Abrahams and Jon Hopkins, was released on 2 November in the United States and 15 November in the UK. The album included five compositions that were adaptions of those tracks that Eno wrote for The Lovely Bones. Eno also sang backing vocals on Anna Calvi's debut album, on the songs \\"Desire\\" and \\"Suzanne & I\\". He later released Drums Between the Bells, a collaboration with poet Rick Holland, on 4 July 2011. In November 2012, Eno released Lux, a 76-minute composition in four sections, through Warp. Eno worked with French‚ÄìAlgerian Ra√Ø singer Rachid Taha on Taha's T√©kitoi (2004) and Zoom (2013) albums, contributing percussion, bass, brass and vocals. Eno also performed with Taha at the Stop the War Coalition concert in London in 2005. In April 2014, Eno sang on, co-wrote, and co-produced Damon Albarn's Heavy Seas of Love, from his solo debut album Everyday Robots. In May 2014, Eno and Underworld's Karl Hyde released Someday World, featuring various guest musicians: from Coldplay's Will Champion and Roxy Music's Andy Mackay to newer names such as 22-year-old Fred Gibson, who helped produce the record with Eno. Within weeks of that release, a second full-length album was announced titled High Life. This was released on 30 June 2014. In January 2016, a new Eno ambient soundscape was premiered as part of Michael Benson's planetary photography exhibition \\"Otherworlds\\" in the Jerwood Gallery of London's Natural History Museum. In a statement Eno commented on the unnamed half-hour piece: The Ship, an album with music from Eno's installation of the same name was released on 29 April 2016 on Warp. In September 2016, the Portuguese synthpop band The Gift, released a single entitled Love Without Violins. As well as singing on the track, Eno co-wrote and produced it. The single was released on the band's own record label La Folie Records on 30 September.\\"The Gift feat. Brian Eno \\"Love Without Violins\\" ‚Äì Official Videoclip\\", YouTube Eno's Reflection, an album of ambient, generative music, was released on Warp Records on 1 January. 2017. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for 2018's 60th. Grammy awards ceremony. In 2019, Eno participated in DAU, an immersive art and cultural installation in Paris by Russian film director Ilya Khrzhanovsky evoking life under Soviet authoritarian rule. Eno contributed six auditory ambiances. =2020s= In March 2020, Eno and his brother, Roger Eno, released their collaborative album Mixing Colours. =Record producer= From the beginning of his solo career in 1973, Eno was in demand as a record producer. The first album with Eno credited as producer was Lucky Leif and the Longships by Robert Calvert. Eno's lengthy string of producer credits includes albums for Talking Heads, U2, Devo, Ultravox and James. He also produced part of the 1993 album When I Was a Boy by Jane Siberry. He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 BRIT Awards. Eno describes himself as a \\"non-musician\\", using the term \\"treatments\\" to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist. His skill at using \\"The Studio as a Compositional Tool\\" (the title of an essay by Eno) led in part to his career as a producer. His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on Genesis's The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, he is credited with 'Enossification'; on Robert Wyatt's Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard with a Direct inject anti-jazz raygun and on John Cale's Island albums as simply being \\"Eno\\". Eno has contributed to recordings by artists as varied as Nico, Robert Calvert, Genesis, David Bowie, and Zvuki Mu, in various capacities such as use of his studio/synthesiser/electronic treatments, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and as just being 'Eno'. In 1984, he (amongst others) composed and performed the \\"Prophecy Theme\\" for the David Lynch film Dune; the rest of the soundtrack was composed and performed by the group Toto. Eno produced performance artist Laurie Anderson's Bright Red album, and also composed for it. The work is avant-garde spoken word with haunting and magnifying sounds. Eno played on David Byrne's musical score for The Catherine Wheel, a project commissioned by Twyla Tharp to accompany her Broadway dance project of the same name. He worked with Bowie as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential 1977‚Äì79 'Berlin Trilogy' of albums, Low, \\"Heroes\\" and Lodger, on Bowie's later album Outside, and on the song \\"I'm Afraid of Americans\\". Recorded in France and Germany, the spacey effects on Low were largely created by Eno, who played a portable EMS Synthi A synthesizer. Producer Tony Visconti used an Eventide Harmonizer to alter the sound of the drums, claiming that the audio processor \\"f‚Äìs with the fabric of time.\\" After Bowie died in early 2016, Eno said that he and Bowie had been talking about taking Outside, the last album they'd worked on together, \\"somewhere new\\", and expressed regret that they wouldn't be able to pursue the project. Eno co-produced The Unforgettable Fire (1984), The Joshua Tree (1987), Achtung Baby (1991), and All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) for U2 with his frequent collaborator Daniel Lanois, and produced 1993's Zooropa with Mark \\"Flood\\" Ellis. In 1995, U2 and Eno joined forces to create the album Original Soundtracks 1 under the group name Passengers; songs from which included \\"Your Blue Room\\" and \\"Miss Sarajevo\\". Even though films are listed and described for each song, all but three are bogus. Eno also produced Laid (1993), Wah Wah (1994) Millionaires (1999) and Pleased to Meet You (2001) for James, performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for \\"frequent interference and occasional co-production\\" on their 1997 album Whiplash. Eno played on the 1986 album Measure for Measure by Australian band Icehouse. He remixed two tracks for Depeche Mode, \\"I Feel You\\" and \\"In Your Room\\", both single releases from the album Songs of Faith and Devotion in 1993. In 1995, Eno provided one of several remixes of \\"Protection\\" by Massive Attack (originally from their Protection album) for release as a single. In 2007, he produced the fourth studio album by Coldplay, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, released in 2008. Also in 2008, he worked with Grace Jones on her album Hurricane, credited for \\"production consultation\\" and as a member of the band, playing keyboards, treatments and background vocals. He worked on the twelfth studio album by U2, again with Lanois, titled No Line on the Horizon. It was recorded in Morocco, the South of France and Dublin and released in Europe on 27 February 2009. In 2011, Eno and Coldplay reunited and Eno contributed \\"enoxification\\" and additional composition on Coldplay's fifth studio album Mylo Xyloto, released on 24 October of that year. Eno's connections to other progressive rock music artists =The Microsoft Sound= In 1994, Microsoft designers Mark Malamud and Erik Gavriluk approached Eno to compose music for the Windows 95 project. The result was the six-second start- up music-sound of the Windows 95 operating system, \\"The Microsoft Sound\\". In an interview with Joel Selvin in the San Francisco Chronicle he said: Eno shed further light on the composition of the sound on the BBC Radio 4 show The Museum of Curiosity, admitting that he created it using a Macintosh computer, stating \\"I wrote it on a Mac. I've never used a PC in my life; I don't like them.\\" =Video work= Eno has spoken of an early and ongoing interest in exploring light in a similar way to his work with sound. He started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. Eno describes the first video camera he received, which would initially become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations: \\"One afternoon while I was working in the studio with Talking Heads, the roadie from Foreigner, working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was, at that time, quite exotic.\\"Eno, Brian (2006). 77 Million Paintings \\"My Light Years\\". pp. 2. The Panasonic industrial camera Eno received had significant design flaws preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works being filmed in vertical format, requiring the television set to be flipped on its side to view it in the proper orientation.Eno, Brian (2006). \\"My Light Years\\". pp. 2. The pieces Eno produced with this method, such as Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan (1980) and Thursday Afternoon (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.' He explained the genre title in the music magazine NME: \\"I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting ... I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast.\\" These works presented Eno with the opportunity to expand his ambient aesthetic into a visual form, manipulating the medium of video to produce something not present in the normal television experience. His video works were shown around the world in exhibitions in New York and Tokyo, as well as released on the compilation 14 Video Paintings in 2005.Eno, Brian (2006). \\"My Light Years\\". pp. 5. Eno continued his video experimentation through the 80s, 90s and 2000s, leading to further experimentation with the television as a malleable light source and informing his generative works such as 77 Million Paintings in 2006.Eno, Brian (2006). \\"My Light Years\\". pp. 6‚Äì8. =Generative music= Eno gives the example of wind chimes. He says that these systems and the creation of them have been a focus of his since he was a student: \\"I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like Terry Riley, and when I first started playing with tape recorders.\\" Initially Eno began to experiment with tape loops to create generative music systems. With the advent of CDs he developed systems to make music of indeterminate duration using several discs of material that he'd specifically recorded so that they would work together musically when driven by random playback. In 1995, he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music through utilising programmed algorithms. The collaboration with Intermorphic led Eno to release Generative Music 1 - which requires Intermorphic's Koan Player software for PC. The Koan software made it possible for generative music to be experienced in the domestic environment for the first time. Generative Music 1 In 1996, Eno collaborated in developing the SSEYO Koan generative music software system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic) that he used in composing Generative Music 1‚Äîonly playable on the Koan generative music system. Further music releases using Koan software include: Wander (2001) and Dark Symphony (2007)‚Äîboth include works by Eno, and those of other artists (including SSEYO's Tim Cole). Released excerpts Eno started to release excerpts of results from his 'generative music' systems as early as 1975 with the album Discreet Music. Then again in 1978 with Music for Airports: The list below consists of albums, soundtracks and downloadable files that contain excerpts from some of Eno's generative music explorations: * 1970 ‚Äì Berlin Horse [Film Short] * 1975 ‚Äì Discreet Music * 1975 ‚Äì Evening Star (Fripp & Eno) * 1978 ‚Äì Ambient 1: Music For Airports * 1981 ‚Äì Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan [Installation Video] * 1982 ‚Äì Ambient 4: On Land * 1983 ‚Äì Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks (Eno, Lanois & R Eno) * 1983 ‚Äì Music For Films II (Eno, Lanois & R Eno) [exclusive to 'Working Backwards' Box Set] * 1984 ‚Äì Thursday Afternoon [Installation Video] * 1985 ‚Äì Thursday Afternoon * 1988 ‚Äì Music For Films III (Various Artists) * 1989 ‚Äì Textures (Eno, Lanois & R Eno) * 1989 ‚Äì For All Mankind [Documentary Soundtrack] * 1992 ‚Äì The Shutov Assembly * 1993 ‚Äì Neroli (Thinking Music Part IV) * 1994 ‚Äì Glitterbug [Original Soundtrack] * 1996 ‚Äì Neverwhere [BBC TV Mini-Series Soundtrack] * 1997 ‚Äì Contra 1.2 * 1997 ‚Äì Lightness * 1998 ‚Äì Music for Prague * 1999 ‚Äì I Dormienti * 1999 ‚Äì Kite Stories * 2000 ‚Äì Music For Civic Recovery Centre * 2001 ‚Äì Compact Forest Proposal * 2003 ‚Äì Curiosities ‚Äì Volume I * 2004 ‚Äì Curiosities ‚Äì Volume II * 2012 ‚Äì Lux * 2013 ‚Äì CAM [Web ‚Äì the book 'Brian Eno: Visual Music' includes a Download Code] * 2014 ‚Äì The Shutov Bonus Material ['Shutov Assembly' Bonus CD] * 2014 ‚Äì New Space Music ['Neroli' Bonus CD] * 2016 ‚Äì The Ship * 2016 ‚Äì Reflection * 2017 ‚Äì Sisters [Web Download] * 2018 ‚Äì Music for Installations [Box Set] Several of the released excerpts (listed above) originated as, or are derivative of, soundtracks Eno created for art installations. Most notably The Shutov Assembly (view breakdown of Album's sources), Contra 1.2 thru to Compact Forest Proposal, Lux, CAM, and The Ship. Installations Eno has created installations combining artworks and sound that have shown across the world since 1979, beginning with 2 Fifth Avenue and White Fence, in the Kitchen Centre, New York, NY. Typically Eno's installations feature light as a medium explored in multi-screen configurations, and music that is created to blur the boundaries between itself and its surroundings: \\"There is a sharp distinction between \\"music\\" and \\"noise\\", just as there is a distinction between the musician and the audience. I like blurring those distinctions ‚Äì I like to work with all the complex sounds on the way out to the horizon, to pure noise, like the hum of London.\\" Anthony Korner, Aurora Musicals, interview with Brian Eno Artforum 24 Summer 1986. Brian Eno Visual Music. P. 137 Christopher Scoates. With each installation Eno's music and artworks interrogate the visitors' perception of space and time within a seductive, immersive environment.The Aesthetics of Time, Christopher Scoates, Brian Eno:Visual Music pp 344-345 Since his experiments with sound as an art student using reel to reel tape recorders,Brian Eno Visual Music. Christopher Scoates pp.31-33  and in art employing the medium of light,Brian Eno Light Music p.9 Paul Stolper Eno has utilised breakthroughs in technology to develop 'processes rather than final objects', processes that in themselves have to \\"jolt your senses,\\" have \\"got to be seductive.\\"Steven Grant: Brian Eno Against Interpretation. Trouser Press, August 1982. Quoted in Brian Eno: Visual Music: Learning from Eno, Steven Dietz p.298. Once set in motion these processes produce potentially un-ending and continuous, non-repeating music and artworks that Eno, though the artist, could not have imagined; and with them he creates the slowly unfolding immersive environments of his installations. David A. Ross writes in the programme notes to Matrix 44 in 1981: \\"In a series of painterly video installations first shown in 1979, Eno explored the notion of environmental ambiance. Eno proposes a use for music and video that is antithetical to behavior control-oriented \\"Muzak\\" in that it induces and invites the viewer to enter a meditative, detached state, rather than serve as an operant conditioner for work-force efficiency. His underlying strategy is to create works which provide natural levels of variety and redundancy which bring attention to, rather than mimic, essential characteristics of the natural environment. Eno echoes Matisse's stated desire that his art serve as an armchair for the weary businessman.\\" Early installations benefitted from breakthroughs in video technology that inspired Eno to use the TV screen as a monitor and enabled him to experiment with the opposite of the fast-moving narratives typical of TV to create evolving images with an almost imperceptible rate of change. \\"2 Fifth Avenue\\", (\\"a linear four-screen installation with music from Music For Airports\\") resulted from Eno shooting \\"the view from his apartment window: without ... intervention,\\" recording \\"what was in front of the camera for an unspecified period of time ... In a simple but crude form of experimental post production, the colour controls of the monitors on which the work was shown were adjusted to wash out the picture, producing a high-contrast black and white image in which colour appeared only in the darkest areas. ... Eno manipulated colour as though painting, observing: 'video for me is a way of configuring light, just as painting is a way of configuring paint.'\\"Brian Eno Visual Music. Christopher Scoates pp.116‚Äì117 From the outset, Eno's video works, were \\"more in the sphere of paintings than of cinema\\".My Light Years Brian Eno accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521 The author and artist John Coulthart called Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan (1980‚Äì81), which incorporated music from Ambient 4: On Land, \\"The first ambient film.\\" He explains: \\"Eno filmed several static views of New York and its drifting cloudscape from his thirteenth-floor apartment in 1980‚Äì81. The low-grade equipment ... give[s] the images a hazy, impressionistic quality. Lack of a tripod meant filming with the camera lying on its side so the tape had to be re-viewed with a television monitor also turned on its side.\\" And turning the TV on its side, says David A. Ross, \\"recontextualize[d] the television set, and ... subliminally shift[ed] the way the video image represents recognizable realities ... Natural phenomena like rain look quite different in this orientation; less familiar but curiously more real.\\" Thursday Afternoon was a return to using figurative form, for Eno had by now begun \\"to think that I could use my TVs as light sources rather than as image sources. ... TV was actually the most controllable light source that had ever been invented ‚Äì because you could precisely specify the movement and behaviour of several million points of coloured light on a surface. The fact that this prodigious possibility had almost exclusively been used to reproduce figurative images in the service of narratives pointed to evolution of the medium from the theatre and cinema. What I thought was that this machine, which pumped out highly controllable light, was actually the first synthesizer, and that its use as an imager-retailer represented a subset of its possible range.\\" Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P121. Chronicle Books. Turning the TV on its back, Eno played video colour fields of differing lengths of time that would slowly re-combine in different configurations. Placing ziggurats (3 dimensional constructions) of different lengths and sizes on top of the screens that defined each separate colour field, these served to project the internal light source upward. \\"The light from it was tangible as though caught in a cloud of vapour. Its slowly changing hues and striking colour collisions were addictive. We sat watching for ages, transfixed by this totally new experience of light as a physical presence.\\"Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P122. Chronicle Books. Calling these light sculptures Crystals (first shown in Boston in 1983), Eno further developed them for the Pictures of Venice exhibition at Gabriella Cardazzo's Cavallino Gallery (Venice,1985). Placing plexiglass on top of the structures he found that these further diffused the light so the shapes outlined through this surface appeared to be described differently in the slowly changing fields of light.My Light Years Brian Eno np accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521 By positioning sound sources in different places and different heights in the exhibition room Eno intended that the music would be something listened to from the inside rather than the outside. For the I Dormienti show in 1999 that featured sculptures of sleeping figures by Mimmo Paladino in the middle of the circular room, Eno placed speakers in each of the 12 tunnels running from it. Envisioning the speakers themselves as instruments, led to Eno's 'speaker flowers' becoming a feature of many installations, including at the Museo dell' Ara Pacis (Rome, 2008), again with Mimmo Paladino and 'Speaker Flowers and Lightboxes' at Castello Svevo in Trani (Italy 2017). Re-imagining the speaker as a flower with a voice that could be heard as it moved in the breeze, he made 'bunches' of them, \\"sculptural objects [that] ... consist of tiny chassis speakers attached to tall metal stands that sway in response to the sound they emit.\\" The first version of these were shown at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam(1984). Since On Land (1982), Eno has sought to blur the boundaries between music and non-music and incorporates environmental sounds into his work. He treats synthesised and recorded sounds for specific effects.Brian Eno : Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time, Christopher Scoates, pp. 135‚Äì137, In the antithesis of 20th century shock art, Eno's works create environments that are: \\"Envisioned as extensions of everyday life while offering a refuge from its stresses.\\"Brian Eno Visual Music p.132 Christopher Scoates. Creating a space to reflect was a stated aim in Eno's Quiet Club series of installations that have shown across the world, and include Music for Civic Recovery Centre at the David Toop curated Sonic Boom festival at the Hayward Gallery in 2000. The Quiet Club series (1986-2001) grew from Eno's site-specific installations that included the Place series (1985-1989). These also featured light sculptures and audio with the addition of conventional materials, such as \\"tree trunks, fish bowls, ladders, rocks\\". Eno used these in unconventional ways to create new and unexpected experiences and modes of engagements, offering an extension of and refuge from, everyday life.Brian Eno: Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time: Christopher Scoates pp132/136 The continually flowing non-repeating music and art of Eno's installations mitigate against habituation to the work and maintain the visitors' engagement with it. \\"One of the things I enjoy about my shows is...lots of people sitting quietly watching something that has no story, few recognisable images and changes very slowly. It's somewhere between the experience of painting, cinema, music and meditation...I dispute the assumption that everyone's attention span is getting shorter: I find people are begging for experiences that are longer and slower, less \\"dramatic\\" and more sensual.\\" {Brian Eno Visual Music p.135 Christopher Scoates. } Tanya Zimbardo writing on New Urban Spaces Series 4. \\"Compact Forest Proposal\\" for SF MOMA (2001) confirms: \\"During the first presentation of this work, as part of the exhibition 010101: Art in Technological Times at SFMOMA in 2001, visitors often spent considerable time in this dreamlike space.\\" In Eno's work, both art and music are released from their normal constraints. The music set up to randomly reconfigure is modal and abstract rather than tonal, and so the listener is freed from expectations set up by Western tonal harmonic conventions.The Dynamics of Harmony: Pratt. The artworks in their continual slowly shifting combinations of colour (and in the case of 77 Million Paintings image re- configurations) themselves offer a continually engaging immersive experience through their unfolding fields of light. 77 Million Paintings Developments in computer technology meant that the experience of Eno's unending non-repeatable generative art and music was no longer only possible in the public spaces of his exhibitions. With software developer and programmer Jake Dowie, Eno created a generative art/music installation '77 Million Paintings' for the domestic environment. Developed for both PC and Mac, the process is explained by Nick Robertson in the accompanying booklet. \\"One way to approach this idea is to imagine that you have a large box full of painted components and you are allowed to blindly take out between one and four of these at any time and overlay them to make a complete painting. The selection of the elements and their duration in the painting is variable and arbitrarily determined‚Ä¶\\" Painting By Numbers, Nick Robertson, 77 Million Paintings HNDVD 1521 Most (nearly all) of the visual 'elements' were hand- painted by Eno onto glass slides, creating an organic heart to the work. Some of the slides had formed his earlier 'Natural Selections' exhibition projected onto the windows of the Triennale in Milan. (1990). This exhibition marked the beginning of Eno's site specific installations that re-defined spaces on a large scale.Brian Eno Visual Music The Aesthetics of Time. Christopher Scoates. ISBN P. 124 For the Triennale exhibition, Eno with Rolf Engel and Roland Blum at Atelier Marktgraph, used new 'dataton' technology that could be programmed to control the fade up and out times of the light sources.My Light Years by Brian Eno. 77 Million Paintings (accompanying booklet)HNDVD 1521 But, unlike the software developed for '77 Million', this was clumsy and limited the practical realisation of Eno's vision. With the computer programmed to randomly select a combination of up to four images of different durations, the on screen painting continually reconfigures as each image slowly dissolves whilst another appears. The painting will be different for every viewer in every situation, uniquely defining each moment. Eno likens his role in creating this piece to one of a gardener planting seeds. And like a gardener he watches to see how they grow, waiting to see if further intervention is necessary. In the liner notes Nick Robertson explains: \\"Every user will buy exactly the same pack of 'seeds' but they will all grow in different ways and into distinct paintings, the vast majority of which, the artist himself has not even seen. ‚Ä¶The original in art is no longer solely bound up in the physical object, but rather in the way the piece lives and grows.\\" Although designed for the domestic environment, 77 million paintings has been (and continues to be) exhibited in multi-screen installations across the world. It has also been projected onto architectural structures, including the sails of the Sydney Opera House (2009), Carioca Aqueduct (The Arcos Di Lapa) Brazil (2012) and the giant Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory (2016). During an exhibition at Fabrica Brighton, (2010) the orthopaedic surgeon Robin Turner noticed the calming effect the work had on the visitors. Turner asked Eno to provide a version for the Montefiore hospital in Hove. Since then 77 Million and Eno's latest \\"Light Boxes\\" have been commissioned for use in hospitals. Montefiore Hospital Installations In 2013, Eno created two permanent light and sound installations at Montefiore Hospital in Hove, East Sussex, England. In the hospital's reception area \\"77 Million Paintings for Montefiore\\" consists of eight plasma monitors mounted on the wall in a diagonally radiating flower-like pattern. They display an evolving collage of coloured patterns and shapes whilst Eno's generative ambient music plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named \\"Quiet Room for Montefiore\\" (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colours in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings Eno's ambient music into focus and facilitates the visitors' cognitive drift, freeing them to contemplate or relax. Spore Eno composed most of the music for the Electronic Arts video game Spore (2008), assisted by his long-term collaborator, the musician and programmer Peter Chilvers. Much of the music is generative and responsive to the player's position within the game. iOS apps Inspired by possibilities presented to Eno and Peter Chilvers whilst working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game Spore (2008), the two began to release generative music in the Apple App format. They set up the website generativemusic.com and created generative music applications for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad: * 2008 ‚Äì Bloom * 2009 ‚Äì Trope * 2012 ‚Äì Scape * 2016 ‚Äì Reflection In 2009, Peter Chilvers and Sandra O'Neill also created an App entitled Air (released through generativemusic.com as well) ‚Äì based on concepts developed by Eno in his Ambient 1: Music for Airports album. Reflection The generative version of Reflection is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike other Apps they released Reflection provides no real options other than Play/Pause ‚Äì later, in its initial update, Airplay and Sleep Timer options were added. As Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price. For those who'd bought the app at a higher price, Eno and Chilvers provided links to a free download of a four track album called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration). The following appears on the app's Apple iTunes page: Previous to the updates for the App, the iTunes page used the following from Eno. The version of Reflection available on the fixed formats (CD, Vinyl and download File) consists of two (joined) excerpts from the Reflection app. This was revealed in Brian's interview with Philip Sherburne: =Artworks: Light Boxes= Eno's \\"light boxes\\" utilise advances in LED technology that has enabled him to re-imagine his ziggurat light paintings - and early light boxes as featured in Kite Stories (1999) - for the domestic environment. The light boxes feature slowly changing combinations of colour fields that draw attention differently to the shapes outlined by delineating structures within. As the paintings slowly evolve each passing moment is defined differently, drawing the viewer's focus into the present moment. The writer and cultural essayist Michael Bracewell writes that the viewer \\"is also encouraged to engage with a generative sensor/aesthetic experience that reflects the ever- changing moods and randomness of life itself\\". He likens Eno's art to \\"Matisse or Rothko at their most enfolding.\\" Brian Eno - Light Music: Shedding Light. Michael Bracewell. Paul Stolper. First shown commercially at the Paul Stolper Gallery in London (forming the Light Music exhibition in 2016 that included lenticular paintings by Eno), 'light boxes' have been shown across the world. They remain in permanent display in both private and public spaces. Recognised for their therapeutic contemplative benefits, Eno's 'light paintings' have been commissioned for specially dedicated places of reflection including in Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the Montefiore Hospital in Hove and a three and a half metre lightbox for the sanctuary room in the Macmillan Horizon Centre in Brighton. =Obscure Records= Eno started the Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, Discreet Music, and the now-famous The Sinking of the Titanic (1969) and Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet (1971) by Gavin Bryars. The second side of Discreet Music consisted of several versions of Pachelbel's Canon, the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a tape loop system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Fripp, most notably on Evening Star. Ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by John Adams, Michael Nyman, and John Cage. =Other work= Professor Nigel Osborne and Brian Eno leading music workshops, Pavarotti centre, Bosnia 1995.Nickalls, Susan.

In 1995, Eno travelled with Edinburgh University's Professor Nigel Osborne to Bosnia in the aftermath of the Bosnian War, to work with war-traumatised children, many of whom had been orphaned in the conflict. Osborne and Eno led music therapy projects run by Warchild in Mostar, at the Pavarotti centre, Bosnia 1995. Eno appeared as Father Brian Eno at the \\"It's Great Being a Priest!\\" convention, in \\"Going to America\\", the final episode of the television sitcom Father Ted, which originally aired on 1 May 1998 on Channel 4. In March 2008, Eno collaborated with the Italian artist Mimmo Paladino on a show of the latter's works with Eno's soundscapes at Ara Pacis in Rome, and in 2011, he joined Stephen Deazley and Edinburgh University music lecturer Martin Parker in an Icebreaker concert at Glasgow City Halls, heralded as a \\"long-awaited clash\\".Vile, Gareth.

His sound installations have been exhibited in many prestigious venues around the world, including the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston; New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; Vancouver Art Gallery, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Centre Pompidou, Paris, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, Baltic Art Centre, Gateshead, and the Sydney, S√£o Paulo, and Venice Biennials.  Awards and honors  Asteroid 81948 Eno, discovered by Marc Buie at Cerro Tololo in 2000, was named in his honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 May 2019 (). In 2019, he was awarded Starmus Festival's Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication for Music & Arts. Influence Eno is frequently referred to as one of popular music's most influential artists.Randall Roberts, \\"Brian Eno to Lecture CSU-Long Beach, Present 77 Million Paintings, Blow Our Minds\\" , LA Weekly, 30 July 2009 Producer and film composer Jon Brion has said: \\"I think he's the most influential artist since the Beatles.\\" Critic Jason Ankeny at AllMusic argues that Eno \\"forever altered the ways in which music is approached, composed, performed, and perceived, and everything from punk to techno to new age bears his unmistakable influence.\\" Eno has spread his techniques and theories primarily through his production; his distinctive style informed a number of projects in which he has been involved, including Bowie's \\"Berlin Trilogy\\" (helping to popularize minimalism) and the albums he produced for Talking Heads (incorporating, on Eno's advice, African music and polyrhythms), Devo, and other groups. Eno's first collaboration with David Byrne, 1981's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, pioneered sampling techniques that would prove to be influential in hip-hop, and broke ground by incorporating world music into popular Western music forms.Gina Vivinetto, \\"Reasons to know Brian Eno\\", SP Times, 1 July 2004 Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies have been used by many bands, and Eno's production style has proven influential in several general respects: \\"his recording techniques have helped change the way that modern musicians;‚Äì particularly electronic musicians;‚Äì view the studio. No longer is it just a passive medium through which they communicate their ideas but itself a new instrument with seemingly endless possibilities.\\" Whilst inspired by the ideas of minimalist composers including John Cage, Terry Riley and Erik Satie,Richardson, Mark. \\"Pitchfork: Interviews: Brian Eno\\". Pitchfork.com. 1 November 2010. Retrieved 9 November 2010. Eno coined the term ambient music to describe his own work and defined the term. The Ambient Music Guide states that he has brought from \\"relative obscurity into the popular consciousness\\" fundamental ideas about ambient music, including \\"the idea of modern music as subtle atmosphere, as chill-out, as impressionistic, as something that creates space for quiet reflection or relaxation.\\" His groundbreaking work in electronic music has been said to have brought widespread attention to and innovations in the role of electronic technology in recording. Pink Floyd keyboardist Rick Wright said he \\"often eulogised\\" Eno's abilities.Q, November 1996 Eno's \\"unconventional studio predilections\\", in common with those of Peter Gabriel, were an influence on the recording of \\"In the Air Tonight\\", the single which launched the solo career of Eno's former drummer Phil Collins. Collins said he \\"learned a lot\\" from working with Eno. Both Half Man Half Biscuit (in the song \\"Eno Collaboration\\" on the EP of the same name) and MGMT have written songs about Eno. LCD Soundsystem has frequently cited Eno as a key influence. The Icelandic singer Bj√∂rk also credited Eno as a major influence. Mora sti Fotia (Babies on Fire), one of the most influential Greek rock bands, was named after Eno's song \\"Baby's on Fire\\". In 2011, Belgian academics from the Royal Museum for Central Africa named a species of Afrotropical spider Pseudocorinna brianeno in his honour. In September 2016, asked by the website Just Six Degrees to name a currently influential artist, Eno cited the conceptual, video and installation artist Jeremy Deller as a source of current inspiration: \\"Deller's work is often technically very ambitious, involving organising large groups of volunteers and helpers, but he himself is almost invisible in the end result. I'm inspired by this quietly subversive way of being an artist, setting up situations and then letting them play out. To me it's a form of social generative art where the 'generators' are people and their experiences, and where the role of the artist is to create a context within which they collide and create.\\" Personal life In 1967, at the age of 18, Eno married Sarah Grenville. They had a daughter, Hannah Louise (born July 1967, Winchester), before divorcing. Eno married his manager, Anthea Norman-Taylor, in 1988. They have two daughters, Irial Violet and Darla Joy (born 1990 and 1991, London). England and Wales Birth Registration Index, 1837-2008 Eno has referred to himself as \\"kind of an evangelical atheist\\" but has also professed an interest in religion. In 1996, Eno and others started the Long Now Foundation to educate the public about the very long-term future of society and to encourage long-term thinking in the exploration of enduring solutions to global issues. In 2005, through the Long Now foundation's Long Bets, he won a $500 bet by challenging someone who predicted a Democrat would be president of the United States in 2005. The Nokia 8800 Sirocco Edition mobile phone features exclusive music composed by Eno. Between 8 January 2007 and 12 February 2007, ten units of Nokia 8800 Sirocco Brian Eno Signature Edition mobile phones, individually numbered and engraved with Eno's signature, were auctioned off. All proceeds went to two charities chosen by Eno: the Keiskamma AIDS treatment program and the World Land Trust. In 1991, Eno appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. His chosen book was Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity by Richard Rorty and his luxury item was a radio telescope. Politics In 2007, Eno joined the Liberal Democrats as youth adviser under Nick Clegg. Eno is now a member of the Labour Party. In August 2015, he endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said at a rally in Camden Town Hall: \\"I don't think electability really is the most important thing. What's important is that someone changes the conversation and moves us off this small-minded agenda.\\" He later wrote in The Guardian: \\"He's [Corbyn] been doing this with courage and integrity and with very little publicity. This already distinguishes him from at least half the people in Westminster, whose strongest motivation seems to have been to get elected, whatever it takes.\\" In 2006, Eno was one of more than 100 artists and writers who signed an open letter calling for an international boycott of Israeli political and cultural institutions.Israel boycott may be the way to peace, The Guardian letters, 15 December 2006 and in January 2009 he spoke out against Israel's military action on the Gaza Strip by writing an opinion for CounterPunch and participating in a large-scale protest in London. In 2014, Eno again protested publicly against what he called a \\"one-sided exercise in ethnic cleansing\\" and a \\"war [with] no moral justification,\\" in reference to the 2014 military operation of Israel into Gaza. He was also a co-signatory, along with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Alice Walker and others, to a letter published in The Guardian that labelled the conflict as an \\"inhumane and illegal act of military aggression\\" and called for \\"a comprehensive and legally binding military embargo on Israel, similar to that imposed on South Africa during apartheid.\\" In 2013, Eno became a patron of Videre Est Credere (Latin for \\"to see is to believe\\"), a UK human rights charity.UK Charity Commission, UK Charity Commission Report on Videre, UK Charity Commission, 20 August 2013 Videre describes itself as \\"give[ing] local activists the equipment, training and support needed to safely capture compelling video evidence of human rights violations. This captured footage is verified, analysed and then distributed to those who can create change.\\"Videre Est Credere, Videre Website, Videre Est Credere, 20 August 2013 He participates alongside movie producers Uri Fruchtmann and Terry Gilliam ‚Äì along with executive director of Greenpeace UK John Sauven. Eno was appointed President of Stop the War Coalition in 2017. He has had a long involvement with the organisation since it was set up in 2001. He is also a trustee of the environmental law firm Client Earth, Somerset House, and the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, set up by Mariana Mazzucato. Eno opposes United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Following the June 2016 referendum result when the British public voted to leave, Eno was among a group of British musicians who signed a letter to the Prime Minister Theresa May calling for a second referendum.

Later Catholic use Within the Catholic Church, it has been given greater prominence because of its employment in documents of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965).

It spoke of \\"the people to whom the testament and the promises were given and from whom Christ was born according to the flesh\\" as among those who \\"are related in various ways to the people of God\\" (section 16). It described in detail the qualities of this People of God in words \\"intended for the laity, religious and clergy alike\\" (section 30), while also pointing out the specific duties and functions of the different ranks of which it is composed, such as that of \\"those who exercise the sacred ministry for the good of their brethren\\" (section 13). In 2001, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was to become in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI, stated that the council's choice of this term reflected three perspectives. The principal one was to introduce a term that could serve as an ecumenical bridge, recognizing intermediate degrees of belonging to the church. Another was to put more in evidence the human element in the church, which is also part of her nature. And the third was to recall that the church has not yet reached her final state and that she \\"will not be wholly herself until the paths of time have been traversed and have blossomed in the hands of God\\".The Ecclesiology of Vatican II Ratzinger also declared that the term is not to be understood in way that would reduce it \\"to an a-theological and purely sociological view\\" of the church.Church as \\"Mystery\\" or \\"People of God\\" Michael Hesemann wrote: While the council distinguished between the Jewish people and \\"the new People of God\\", Carl E.

Braaten =Use since the Second Vatican Council= The Popes have continued to use the expression \\"the People of God\\".

Man getting a handjob A handjob is a sex act, performed as either foreplay or as non-penetrative sex, that involves the manual stimulation of a man's penis or scrotum by another person to induce an erection for sexual pleasure, sexual arousal and sometimes resulting in orgasm and ejaculation. A handjob can be sexually arousing for both participants and may be an erotic and physically intimate act of its own. A person may give their male partner a handjob so as not to engage in penetrative sexual activity. Besides avoiding the risks associated with sexual penetration, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or pregnancy from penile-vaginal sex, some people engage in non-penetrative sex to preserve virginity. Prevalence in massage parlors In massage parlors, a masseuse, whether as part of the massage itself or directly after it, may perform a handjob on their customer; this is known by the euphemism \\"happy ending\\". An investigation by Time Out New York in January 2011 found many New York City massage parlors advertising \\"sensual massage\\" and providing handjobs. The parlors charged from $60 to $160, with an extra tip for the sex workers (usually $40) for a massage and manual \\"happy ending\\".

He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his writing is in English and a light Scots dialect, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest. He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement, and after his death he became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism, and a cultural icon in Scotland and among the Scottish diaspora around the world. Celebration of his life and work became almost a national charismatic cult during the 19th and 20th centuries, and his influence has long been strong on Scottish literature. In 2009 he was chosen as the greatest Scot by the Scottish public in a vote run by Scottish television channel STV. As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected folk songs from across Scotland, often revising or adapting them. His poem (and song) \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is often sung at Hogmanay (the last day of the year), and \\"Scots Wha Hae\\" served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country. Other poems and songs of Burns that remain well known across the world today include \\"A Red, Red Rose\\", \\"A Man's a Man for A' That\\", \\"To a Louse\\", \\"To a Mouse\\", \\"The Battle of Sherramuir\\", \\"Tam o' Shanter\\" and \\"Ae Fond Kiss\\". Life and background =Ayrshire= The Burns Cottage in Alloway, Ayrshire Inside the Burns Cottage Alloway Burns was born two miles (3 km) south of Ayr, in Alloway, the eldest of the seven children of William Burnes (1721‚Äì1784), a self-educated tenant farmer from Dunnottar in the Mearns, and Agnes Broun (1732‚Äì1820), the daughter of a Kirkoswald tenant farmer. He was born in a house built by his father (now the Burns Cottage Museum), where he lived until Easter 1766, when he was seven years old. William Burnes sold the house and took the tenancy of the Mount Oliphant farm, southeast of Alloway. Here Burns grew up in poverty and hardship, and the severe manual labour of the farm left its traces in a premature stoop and a weakened constitution. He had little regular schooling and got much of his education from his father, who taught his children reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, and history and also wrote for them A Manual of Christian Belief. He was also taught by John Murdoch (1747‚Äì1824), who opened an \\"adventure school\\" in Alloway in 1763 and taught Latin, French, and mathematics to both Robert and his brother Gilbert (1760‚Äì1827) from 1765 to 1768 until Murdoch left the parish. After a few years of home education, Burns was sent to Dalrymple Parish School in mid-1772 before returning at harvest time to full-time farm labouring until 1773, when he was sent to lodge with Murdoch for three weeks to study grammar, French, and Latin. By the age of 15, Burns was the principal labourer at Mount Oliphant. During the harvest of 1774, he was assisted by Nelly Kilpatrick (1759‚Äì1820), who inspired his first attempt at poetry, \\"O, Once I Lov'd A Bonnie Lass\\". In 1775, he was sent to finish his education with a tutor at Kirkoswald, where he met Peggy Thompson (born 1762), to whom he wrote two songs, \\"Now Westlin' Winds\\" and \\"I Dream'd I Lay\\". Tarbolton Despite his ability and character, William Burnes was consistently unfortunate, and migrated with his large family from farm to farm without ever being able to improve his circumstances. At Whitsun, 1777, he removed his large family from the unfavourable conditions of Mount Oliphant to the farm at Lochlea, near Tarbolton, where they stayed until William Burnes's death in 1784. Subsequently, the family became integrated into the community of Tarbolton. To his father's disapproval, Robert joined a country dancing school in 1779 and, with Gilbert, formed the Tarbolton Bachelors' Club the following year. His earliest existing letters date from this time, when he began making romantic overtures to Alison Begbie (b. 1762). In spite of four songs written for her and a suggestion that he was willing to marry her, she rejected him. Robert Burns was initiated into the Masonic lodge St David, Tarbolton, on 4 July 1781, when he was 22. In December 1781, Burns moved temporarily to Irvine to learn to become a flax-dresser, but during the workers' celebrations for New Year 1781/1782 (which included Burns as a participant) the flax shop caught fire and was burnt to the ground. This venture accordingly came to an end, and Burns went home to Lochlea farm. During this time he met and befriended Captain Richard Brown who encouraged him to become a poet. He continued to write poems and songs and began a commonplace book in 1783, while his father fought a legal dispute with his landlord. The case went to the Court of Session, and Burnes was upheld in January 1784, a fortnight before he died. Mauchline Nasmyth portrait of 1787, Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Robert and Gilbert made an ineffectual struggle to keep on the farm, but after its failure they moved to the farm at Mossgiel, near Mauchline, in March, which they maintained with an uphill fight for the next four years. In mid-1784 Burns came to know a group of girls known collectively as The Belles of Mauchline, one of whom was Jean Armour, the daughter of a stonemason from Mauchline. Love affairs His first child, Elizabeth \\"Bess\\" Burns (1785‚Äì1817), was born to his mother's servant, Elizabeth Paton (1760‚Äìcirca 1799), while he was embarking on a relationship with Jean Armour, who became pregnant with twins in March 1786. Burns signed a paper attesting his marriage to Jean, but her father \\"was in the greatest distress, and fainted away\\". To avoid disgrace, her parents sent her to live with her uncle in Paisley. Although Armour's father initially forbade it, they were married in 1788. Armour bore him nine children, three of whom survived infancy. Burns was in financial difficulties due to his lack of success in farming, and to make enough money to support a family he took up an offer of work in Jamaica from Patrick Douglas of Garrallan, Old Cumnock, whose sugar plantations outside Port Antonio were managed by his brother Charles, under whom Burns was to be a \\"book keeper\\" (assistant overseer of slaves).; ; It has been suggested that the position was for a single man, and that he would live in rustic conditions, not likely to be living in the great house at a salary of ¬£30 per annum. Burns's egalitarian views were typified by \\"The Slave's Lament\\" six years later, but in 1786 there was little public awareness of the abolitionist movement that began about that time. At about the same time, Burns fell in love with Mary Campbell (1763‚Äì1786), whom he had seen in church while he was still living in Tarbolton. She was born near Dunoon and had lived in Campbeltown before moving to work in Ayrshire. He dedicated the poems \\"The Highland Lassie O\\", \\"Highland Mary\\", and \\"To Mary in Heaven\\" to her. His song \\"Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary, And leave auld Scotia's shore?\\" suggests that they planned to emigrate to Jamaica together. Their relationship has been the subject of much conjecture, and it has been suggested that on 14 May 1786 they exchanged Bibles and plighted their troth over the Water of Fail in a traditional form of marriage. Soon afterwards Mary Campbell left her work in Ayrshire, went to the seaport of Greenock, and sailed home to her parents in Campbeltown. In October 1786, Mary and her father sailed from Campbeltown to visit her brother in Greenock. Her brother fell ill with typhus, which she also caught while nursing him. She died of typhus on 20 or 21 October 1786 and was buried there. Kilmarnock volume Title page of the Kilmarnock Edition As Burns lacked the funds to pay for his passage to the West Indies, Gavin Hamilton suggested that he should \\"publish his poems in the mean time by subscription, as a likely way of getting a little money to provide him more liberally in necessaries for Jamaica.\\" On 3 April Burns sent proposals for publishing his Scotch Poems to John Wilson, a printer in Kilmarnock, who published these proposals on 14 April 1786, on the same day that Jean Armour's father tore up the paper in which Burns attested his marriage to Jean. To obtain a certificate that he was a free bachelor, Burns agreed on 25 June to stand for rebuke in the Mauchline kirk for three Sundays. He transferred his share in Mossgiel farm to his brother Gilbert on 22 July, and on 30 July wrote to tell his friend John Richmond that, \\"Armour has got a warrant to throw me in jail until I can find a warrant for an enormous sum ... I am wandering from one friend's house to another.\\" On 31 July 1786 John Wilson published the volume of works by Robert Burns, Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish dialect. Known as the Kilmarnock volume, it sold for 3 shillings and contained much of his best writing, including \\"The Twa Dogs\\", \\"Address to the Deil\\", \\"Halloween\\", \\"The Cotter's Saturday Night\\", \\"To a Mouse\\", \\"Epitaph for James Smith\\", and \\"To a Mountain Daisy\\", many of which had been written at Mossgiel farm. The success of the work was immediate, and soon he was known across the country. Burns postponed his planned emigration to Jamaica on 1 September, and was at Mossgiel two days later when he learnt that Jean Armour had given birth to twins. On 4 September Thomas Blacklock wrote a letter expressing admiration for the poetry in the Kilmarnock volume, and suggesting an enlarged second edition. A copy of it was passed to Burns, who later recalled, \\"I had taken the last farewell of my few friends, my chest was on the road to Greenock; I had composed the last song I should ever measure in Scotland ‚Äì 'The Gloomy night is gathering fast' ‚Äì when a letter from Dr Blacklock to a friend of mine overthrew all my schemes, by opening new prospects to my poetic ambition. The Doctor belonged to a set of critics for whose applause I had not dared to hope. His opinion that I would meet with encouragement in Edinburgh for a second edition, fired me so much, that away I posted for that city, without a single acquaintance, or a single letter of introduction.\\" =Edinburgh= Alexander Nasmyth, Robert Burns (1828) On 27 November 1786 Burns borrowed a pony and set out for Edinburgh. On 14 December William Creech issued subscription bills for the first Edinburgh edition of Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish dialect, which was published on 17 April 1787. Within a week of this event, Burns had sold his copyright to Creech for 100 guineas. For the edition, Creech commissioned Alexander Nasmyth to paint the oval bust-length portrait now in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, which was engraved to provide a frontispiece for the book. Nasmyth had come to know Burns and his fresh and appealing image has become the basis for almost all subsequent representations of the poet. In Edinburgh, he was received as an equal by the city's men of letters‚Äîincluding Dugald Stewart, Robertson, Blair and others‚Äîand was a guest at aristocratic gatherings, where he bore himself with unaffected dignity. Here he encountered, and made a lasting impression on, the 16-year-old Walter Scott, who described him later with great admiration: Bernard Street, Leith The new edition of his poems brought Burns ¬£400. His stay in the city also resulted in some lifelong friendships, among which were those with Lord Glencairn, and Frances Anna Dunlop (1730‚Äì1815), who became his occasional sponsor and with whom he corresponded for many years until a rift developed. He embarked on a relationship with the separated Agnes \\"Nancy\\" McLehose (1758‚Äì1841), with whom he exchanged passionate letters under pseudonyms (Burns called himself \\"Sylvander\\" and Nancy \\"Clarinda\\"). When it became clear that Nancy would not be easily seduced into a physical relationship, Burns moved on to Jenny Clow (1766‚Äì1792), Nancy's domestic servant, who bore him a son, Robert Burns Clow, in 1788. He also had an affair with a servant girl, Margaret \\"May\\" Cameron. His relationship with Nancy concluded in 1791 with a final meeting in Edinburgh before she sailed to Jamaica for what turned out to be a short-lived reconciliation with her estranged husband. Before she left, he sent her the manuscript of \\"Ae Fond Kiss\\" as a farewell. In Edinburgh, in early 1787, he met James Johnson, a struggling music engraver and music seller with a love of old Scots songs and a determination to preserve them. Burns shared this interest and became an enthusiastic contributor to The Scots Musical Museum. The first volume was published in 1787 and included three songs by Burns. He contributed 40 songs to volume two, and he ended up responsible for about a third of the 600 songs in the whole collection, as well as making a considerable editorial contribution. The final volume was published in 1803. =Dumfriesshire= Ellisland Farm The River Nith at Ellisland Farm. Ellisland farm in the time of Robert Burns On his return from Edinburgh in February 1788, he resumed his relationship with Jean Armour and took a lease on Ellisland Farm, Dumfriesshire, settling there in June. He also trained as a gauger or exciseman in case farming continued to be unsuccessful. He was appointed to duties in Customs and Excise in 1789 and eventually gave up the farm in 1791. Meanwhile, in November 1790, he had written his masterpiece, the narrative poem \\"Tam O' Shanter\\". The Ellisland farm beside the river Nith, now holds a unique collection of Burns's books, artefacts, and manuscripts and is mostly preserved as when Burns and his young family lived there, and is well worth a visit. About this time he was offered and declined an appointment in London on the staff of The Star newspaper,Robert Burns: \\"Poetry ‚Äì Poems ‚Äì Poets .\\" Retrieved on 24 September 2010 and refused to become a candidate for a newly created Chair of Agriculture in the University of Edinburgh, although influential friends offered to support his claims. He did however accept membership of the Royal Company of Archers in 1792. Lyricist After giving up his farm, he removed to Dumfries. It was at this time that, being requested to write lyrics for The Melodies of Scotland, he responded by contributing over 100 songs. He made major contributions to George Thomson's A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice as well as to James Johnson's Scots Musical Museum. Arguably his claim to immortality chiefly rests on these volumes, which placed him in the front rank of lyric poets. As a songwriter he provided his own lyrics, sometimes adapted from traditional words. He put words to Scottish folk melodies and airs which he collected, and composed his own arrangements of the music including modifying tunes or recreating melodies on the basis of fragments. In letters he explained that he preferred simplicity, relating songs to spoken language which should be sung in traditional ways. The original instruments would be fiddle and the guitar of the period which was akin to a cittern, but the transcription of songs for piano has resulted in them usually being performed in classical concert or music hall styles. At the 3 week Celtic Connections festival Glasgow each January, Burns songs are often performed with both fiddle and guitar. Thomson as a publisher commissioned arrangements of \\"Scottish, Welsh and Irish Airs\\" by such eminent composers of the day as Franz Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, with new lyrics. The contributors of lyrics included Burns. While such arrangements had wide popular appeal, Beethoven's music was more advanced and difficult to play than Thomson intended.\\"Ludwig and Rabbie: a partnership that ended in tears\\". The Independent, 2 December 2005. Retrieved 23 December 2015 Burns described how he had to master singing the tune before he composed the words: Burns House in Dumfries, Scotland Burns also worked to collect and preserve Scottish folk songs, sometimes revising, expanding, and adapting them. One of the better known of these collections is The Merry Muses of Caledonia (the title is not Burns's), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century. At Dumfries, he wrote his world famous song \\"A Man's a Man for A' That\\", which was based on the writings in The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine, who wrote on reform. Burns sent the poem anonymously in 1795 to the Glasgow Courier. He was also a radical for reform and wrote poems for democracy, such as ‚Äì Parcel of Rogues to the Nation, The Slaves Lament and the Rights of Women. Many of Burns's most famous poems are songs with the music based upon older traditional songs. For example, \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is set to the traditional tune \\"Can Ye Labour Lea\\", \\"A Red, Red Rose\\" is set to the tune of \\"Major Graham\\" and \\"The Battle of Sherramuir\\" is set to the \\"Cameronian Rant\\". Failing health and death The death room of Robert Burns Robert Burns Mausoleum at St Michael's churchyard in Dumfries Burns's worldly prospects were perhaps better than they had ever been; but he had become soured, and had alienated many of his friends by freely expressing sympathy with the French and American Revolutions, for the advocates of democratic reform and votes for all men and the Society of the Friends of the People which advocated Parliamentary Reform. His political views came to the notice of his employers, to which he pleaded his innocence. Burns met other radicals at the Globe Inn Dumfries. As an Exciseman he felt compelled to join the Royal Dumfries Volunteers in March 1795. He lived here in Dumfries in a two-storey red sandstone house on Mill Hole Brae, now Burns street which is now a museum. He went on long journeys on horseback, often in harsh weather conditions as an Excise Supervisor. He was kept very busy ‚Äì as the exciseman, doing reports, father of four young children, song collector and songwriter. As his health began to give way, he began to age prematurely and fell into fits of despondency.

Edinburgh : Mainstream Publishing. . p. 321. On the morning of 21 July 1796, Burns died in Dumfries, at the age of 37. The funeral took place on Monday 25 July 1796, the day that his son Maxwell was born. He was at first buried in the far corner of St. Michael's Churchyard in Dumfries; a simple \\"slab of freestone\\" was erected as his gravestone by Jean Armour, which some felt insulting to his memory. His body was eventually moved to its final location in the same cemetery, the Burns Mausoleum, in September 1817. The body of his widow Jean Armour was buried with his in 1834. Armour had taken steps to secure his personal property, partly by liquidating two promissory notes amounting to fifteen pounds sterling (about 1,100 pounds at 2009 prices). The family went to the Court of Session in 1798 with a plan to support his surviving children by publishing a four-volume edition of his complete works and a biography written by Dr. James Currie. Subscriptions were raised to meet the initial cost of publication, which was in the hands of Thomas Cadell and William Davies in London and William Creech, bookseller in Edinburgh. Hogg records that fund- raising for Burns's family was embarrassingly slow, and it took several years to accumulate significant funds through the efforts of John Syme and Alexander Cunningham. Burns was posthumously given the freedom of the town of Dumfries. Hogg records that Burns was given the freedom of the Burgh of Dumfries on 4 June 1787, 9 years before his death, and was also made an Honorary Burgess of Dumfries.Hogg, PS (2008). Robert Burns. The Patriot Bard. Edinburgh : Mainstream Publishing. . p. 154. Through his twelve children, Burns has over 900 living descendants as of 2019. Literary style Tam O‚ÄôShanter's Ride, Victoria Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia Burns's style is marked by spontaneity, directness, and sincerity, and ranges from the tender intensity of some of his lyrics through the humour of \\"Tam o' Shanter\\" and the satire of \\"Holy Willie's Prayer\\" and \\"The Holy Fair\\". Burns's poetry drew upon a substantial familiarity with and knowledge of Classical, Biblical, and English literature, as well as the Scottish Makar tradition.Robert Burns: \\"Literary Style .\\" Retrieved on 24 September 2010 Burns was skilled in writing not only in the Scots language but also in the Scottish English dialect of the English language.

Burns himself referred to suffering from episodes of what he called \\"blue devilism\\". The National Trust for Scotland has downplayed the suggestion on the grounds that evidence is insufficient to support the claim. Influence =Britain= Burns is generally classified as a proto-Romantic poet, and he influenced William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Percy Bysshe Shelley greatly. His direct literary influences in the use of Scots in poetry were Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson. The Edinburgh literati worked to sentimentalise Burns during his life and after his death, dismissing his education by calling him a \\"heaven-taught ploughman\\". Burns influenced later Scottish writers, especially Hugh MacDiarmid, who fought to dismantle what he felt had become a sentimental cult that dominated Scottish literature. =Canada= Burns Monument in Dorchester Square, Montr√©al, Qu√©bec Burns had a significant influence on Alexander McLachlanRobert Burns and Friends (Essays by W. Ormiston Roy Fellows presented to G. Ross Roy), Patrick Scott & Kenneth Simson, eds., Book Surge Publishing, 2012, , Chapter \\"Alexander McLachlan: 'The Robert Burns' of Canada\\", contribution of Edward J. Cowan, pp. 131‚Äì149 and some influence on Robert Service. While this may not be so obvious in Service's English verse, which is Kiplingesque, it is more readily apparent in his Scots verse. Scottish Canadians have embraced Robert Burns as a kind of patron poet and mark his birthday with festivities. 'Robbie Burns Day' is celebrated from Newfoundland and Labrador to Nanaimo. Every year, Canadian newspapers publish biographies of the poet, listings of local events and buffet menus. Universities mark the date in a range of ways: McMaster University library organized a special collection and Simon Fraser University's Centre for Scottish Studies organized a marathon reading of Burns's poetry. Senator Heath Macquarrie quipped of Canada's first Prime Minister that \\"While the lovable [Robbie] Burns went in for wine, women and song, his fellow Scot, John A. did not chase women and was not musical!\\" 'Gung Haggis Fat Choy' is a hybrid of Chinese New Year and Robbie Burns Day, celebrated in Vancouver since the late 1990s. =United States= Burns Commons in Milwaukee, USA In January 1864, President Abraham Lincoln was invited to attend a Robert Burns celebration by Robert Crawford; and if unable to attend, send a toast. Lincoln composed a toast.Crawford, Robert. \\"The Abraham Lincoln Papers at the Library of Congress.\\" Robert Crawford to Abraham Lincoln, Saturday, 23 January 1864 (Invitation to attend Robert Burns celebration). 23 January 1864. http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/malquery.html (accessed 20 January 2013). Lincoln's toast: see Collected Works, VIII, 237. An example of Burns's literary influence in the US is seen in the choice by novelist John Steinbeck of the title of his 1937 novel, Of Mice and Men, taken from a line in the second-to-last stanza of \\"To a Mouse\\": \\"The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley.\\" Burns's influence on American vernacular poets such as James Whitcomb Riley and Frank Lebby Stanton has been acknowledged by their biographers.See, e.g., Paul Stevenson, \\"Stanton‚Äîthe Writer with a Heart\\" in Atlanta Constitution, 1925 January 18, p. 1; republished by When asked for the source of his greatest creative inspiration, singer songwriter Bob Dylan selected Burns's 1794 song \\"A Red, Red Rose\\" as the lyric that had the biggest effect on his life. The author J. D. Salinger used protagonist Holden Caulfield's misinterpretation of Burns's poem \\"Comin' Through the Rye\\" as his title and a main interpretation of Caulfield's grasping to his childhood in his 1951 novel The Catcher in the Rye. The poem, actually about a rendezvous, is thought by Caulfield to be about saving people from falling out of childhood. =Russia= Burns became the \\"people's poet\\" of Russia. In Imperial Russia Burns was translated into Russian and became a source of inspiration for the ordinary, oppressed Russian people. In Soviet Russia, he was elevated as the archetypal poet of the people. As a great admirer of the egalitarian ethos behind the American and French Revolutions who expressed his own egalitarianism in poems such as his \\"Birthday Ode for George Washington\\" or his \\"Is There for Honest Poverty\\" (commonly known as \\"A Man's a Man for a' that\\"), Burns was well placed for endorsement by the Communist regime as a \\"progressive\\" artist. A new translation of Burns begun in 1924 by Samuil Marshak proved enormously popular, selling over 600,000 copies. The USSR honoured Burns with a commemorative stamp in 1956. He remains popular in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. Honours =Landmarks and organisations= Ellisland Farm c. 1900 Confederate Park, by the Robert Burns Association of Jacksonville, Florida Burns clubs have been founded worldwide. The first one, known as The Mother Club, was founded in Greenock in 1801 by merchants born in Ayrshire, some of whom had known Burns. The club set its original objectives as \\"To cherish the name of Robert Burns; to foster a love of his writings, and generally to encourage an interest in the Scottish language and literature.\\" The club also continues to have local charitable work as a priority. Burns's birthplace in Alloway is now a National Trust for Scotland property called the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum. It includes: the humble Burns Cottage where he was born and spent the first years of his life, a modern museum building which houses more than 5,000 Burns artefacts including his handwritten manuscripts, the historic Alloway Auld Kirk and Brig o Doon which feature in Burns's masterpiece 'Tam o Shanter', and the Burns Monument which was erected in Burns's honour and finished in 1823. His house in Dumfries is operated as the Robert Burns House, and the Robert Burns Centre in Dumfries features more exhibits about his life and works. Ellisland Farm in Auldgirth, which he owned from 1788 to 1791, is maintained as a working farm with a museum and interpretation centre by the Friends of Ellisland Farm. Significant 19th-century monuments to him stand in Alloway, Leith, and Dumfries. An early 20th-century replica of his birthplace cottage belonging to the Burns Club Atlanta stands in Atlanta, Georgia. These are part of a large list of Burns memorials and statues around the world. Organisations include the Robert Burns Fellowship of the University of Otago in New Zealand, and the Burns Club Atlanta in the United States. Towns named after Burns include Burns, New York, and Burns, Oregon. In the suburb of Summerhill, Dumfries, the majority of the streets have names with Burns connotations. A British Rail Standard Class 7 steam locomotive was named after him, along with a later Class 87 electric locomotive, No. 87035. On 24 September 1996, Class 156 diesel unit 156433 was named \\"The Kilmarnock Edition\\" by Jimmy Knapp, General Secretary of the RMT union, at Girvan Station to launch the new \\"Burns Line\\" services between Girvan, Ayr, and Kilmarnock, supported by Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT). Burns statue in Treasury Gardens, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Several streets surrounding the Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.'s Back Bay Fens in Boston, Massachusetts, were designated with Burns connotations. A life-size statue was dedicated in Burns's honour within the Back Bay Fens of the West Fenway neighbourhood in 1912. It stood until 1972 when it was relocated downtown, sparking protests from the neighbourhood, literary fans, and preservationists of Olmsted's vision for the Back Bay Fens. There is a statue of Burns in The Octagon, Dunedin, in the same pose as the one in Dundee. Dunedin's first European settlers were Scots; Thomas Burns, a nephew of Burns, was one of Dunedin's founding fathers. A crater on Mercury is named after Burns. In November 2012, Burns was awarded the title Honorary Chartered Surveyor by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the only posthumous membership so far granted by the institution. The oldest statue of Burns is in the town of Camperdown, Victoria. It now hosts an annual Robert Burns Scottish Festival in celebration of the statue and its history. =Stamps and currency= USSR 1956 The Soviet Union was the first country in the world to honour Burns with a commemorative stamp, marking the 160th anniversary of his death in 1956.Robert Burns World Federation Limited Burns chronicle, Volume 4, Issue 3 p.27. Burns Federation, 1995 The Royal Mail has issued postage stamps commemorating Burns three times. In 1966, two stamps were issued, priced fourpence and one shilling and threepence, both carrying Burns's portrait. In 1996, an issue commemorating the bicentenary of his death comprised four stamps, priced 19p, 25p, 41p and 60p and including quotes from Burns's poems. On 22 January 2009, two stamps were issued by the Royal Mail to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Burns's birth. Burns was pictured on the Clydesdale Bank ¬£5 note from 1971 to 2009. On the reverse of the note was a vignette of a field mouse and a wild rose in reference to Burns's poem \\"To a Mouse\\". The Clydesdale Bank's notes were redesigned in 2009 and, since then, he has been pictured on the front of their ¬£10 note. In September 2007, the Bank of Scotland redesigned their banknotes to feature famous Scottish bridges. The reverse side of new ¬£5 features Brig o' Doon, famous from Burns's poem \\"Tam o' Shanter\\", and pictures the statue of Burns at that site.

The project ended when Hovey died, after seven of the planned twenty-two volumes were completed. Redpath also recorded four cassettes of Burns's songs (re-issued as 3 CDs) for the Scots Musical Museum. In 1996, a musical about Burns's life called Red Red Rose won third place at a competition for new musicals in Denmark. Robert Burns was played by John Barrowman. On 25 January 2008, a musical play about the love affair between Robert Burns and Nancy McLehose entitled Clarinda premiered in Edinburgh before touring Scotland. The plan was that Clarinda would make its American premiere in Atlantic Beach, FL, at Atlantic Beach Experimental Theatre on 25 January 2013. Eddi Reader has released two albums, Sings the Songs of Robert Burns and The Songs of Robert Burns Deluxe Edition, about the work of the poet. Alfred B. Street wrote the words and Henry Tucker wrote the music for a song called Our Own Robbie Burns in 1856. =Burns suppers= \\"Great chieftain o' the puddin-race!\\" ‚Äì cutting the haggis at a Burns supper Burns Night, in effect a second national day, is celebrated on Burns's birthday, 25 January, with Burns suppers around the world, and is more widely observed in Scotland than the official national day, St. Andrew's Day. The first Burns supper in The Mother Club in Greenock was held on what was thought to be his birthday on 29 January 1802; in 1803 it was discovered from the Ayr parish records that the correct date was 25 January 1759. The format of Burns suppers has changed little since. The basic format starts with a general welcome and announcements, followed with the Selkirk Grace. After the grace comes the piping and cutting of the haggis, when Burns's famous \\"Address to a Haggis\\" is read and the haggis is cut open. The event usually allows for people to start eating just after the haggis is presented. At the end of the meal, a series of toasts, often including a 'Toast to the Lassies', and replies are made. This is when the toast to \\"the immortal memory\\", an overview of Burns's life and work, is given. The event usually concludes with the singing of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\". =Greatest Scot= In 2009, STV ran a television series and public vote on who was \\"The Greatest Scot\\" of all time.

He is most widely known for Lamborghini's turn-around in the early 1980s and his art exhibit, \\"The Billboard Project\\". Biography = Business =  Lamborghini: 1978-1987  Before becoming an artist, Patrick Mimran was the owner and CEO of Lamborghini. In 1981, at the age of 24, Mimran and his brother, Jean Claude, purchased the company's failing assets for US$3 million. The brothers had purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and began investing heavily in the company's expansion, developing a comprehensive restructuring program. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 off-road vehicle. Patrick served as CEO until 1987 when he sold the company to Chrysler. = Art =  Multimedia artist: 1990-present  After years as a successful businessman, Mimran turned to art. Mimran's artwork has ranged through media including painting, photography, video art, sculpture, and installations. Mimran's work has been exhibited in museums including the Leonardo da Vinci Museum for Science and Technology, Palazzo Venezia and Kunstpalais Erlangen, as well as festivals including the Venice Architecture Biennale, Art Cologne, Art Paris and Art Karlsruhe. = Musical composition = He also works in electronic music, composing the score for Maurice B√©jart‚Äôs ballet Kurozuka[3] (performed at the Bunkan Kalkan Theatre, Tokyo)[4] and collaborating with Peter Greenaway. Mimran composed scores for Greenaway projects including the multidisciplinary film and art installation \\"Stairs 1 Geneva\\", the 1996 film, The Pillow Book, the 1996 public art event \\"La Cosmologia di Piazza del Popolo Roma\\", and the art installation, \\"In the Dark\\", which was featured in the 1996 exhibition, \\"Spellbound: Art and Film\\" at the Hayward Gallery of London. In addition to musical scores, Mimran has released four albums. Novels For The Moons (1981), his first album, was heavily influenced by German electronic pioneers and released on the imprint Lamborghini Records. He subsequently released Back to Earth (1983), Honni Soit ‚Äì Qui Mal Y Pense (1987) with vocalist James Bowman, and Service Entrance (2017), a collection of soft piano music. = Sculpture = Mimran's \\"Jet Set Giraffe\\" sculpture, standing at 7.5 meters, is considered the tallest giraffe sculpture in the world. It was installed in the Monte Carlo's Grand Casino Garden from 2009 to 2013, when it was moved to its permanent home at the Colchester Zoo in Essex, England. The giraffe, made of glass fiber and steel, appears to be solid metallic silver but transforms into a silhouette lit by 214 colorful lights at night. = The Billboard Project: 2000-2012 = Patrick Mimran is best known in the United States for his Billboard Project, a comprehensive series of billboards which he initiated in 2000 in London and later expanded to New York, Miami, Venice, and Tokyo. For the project, Mimran used advertisement billboards as a platform for short aphorisms that provided commentary about art and the relationships between artists, critics, curators and art dealers. The billboards attracted a fan base. = Wearable art = In 2015, Mimran turned 25 of his paintings into wearable art by developing the cashmere scarf line, Allezzou Fashion. = Digital art = Mimran recently developed the Aphos App, a digital rendition of his \\"Billboard Project\\" which allows users anywhere in the world to create their own boards with quotes, aphorisms, and comments about art, politics, news, fashion, music, or any subject related to their daily lives and interests.

It is named for the Medusa of Greek mythology. \\"Fossae\\" is Latin for \\"trenches\\". Located roughly at , it straddles the highland - lowland boundary near the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic areas. The Medusae Fossae Formation lies partly in five quadrangles: the Amazonis quadrangle, the Tharsis quadrangle, the Memnonia quadrangle, the Elysium quadrangle, and the Aeolis quadrangle. The Medusae Fossae Formation is a soft, easily eroded deposit that extends (discontinuously) for more than 5,000 km along the equator of Mars. It has an area equal to 20% the size of the continental United States. Sometimes, the formation appears as a smooth and gently undulating surface, however in places it is wind-sculpted into ridges and grooves. Radar imaging has suggested that the region may contain either extremely porous rock (for example volcanic ash) or deep layers of glacier- like ice deposits amounting to about the same quantity as is stored in Mars' south polar cap. Using a global climate model, a group of researchers headed by Laura Kerber found that the Medusae Fossae Formation could have been formed from ash from the volcanoes Apollinaris Mons, Arsia Mons, and possibly Pavonis Mons. Further evidence for a fine-grained composition is the fact that the area gives almost no radar return. For this reason it has been called a \\"stealth\\" region. The formation is divided into three subunits (members) that are all considered to be of Amazonian age, the youngest era in martian geological history. Comparisons of elemental composition suggest that the Medusae Fossae Formation has been the main source of Mars' ubiquitous surface dust. In July 2018, researchers reported that, indeed, the largest single source of dust on the planet Mars is the Medusae Fossae Formation. An analysis of data from the Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer revealed that the western lobe of the Medusae Fossae Formation contains water. This means that this formation contains bulk water ice. During periods of high obliquity (tilt) water ice was stable on the surface. Combining several gravity models of Mars with the MOLA topographic dataset allowed calculation of the density of the deposit; the value is 1.765 ¬± 0.105 g/cm3, similar to the density of terrestrial ignimbrites. This rules out significant amounts of ice in the bulk composition. In combination with the deposit's high content of sulfur and chlorine, it implies an explosive volcanic origin. The total volume of the deposit is 1.4 √ó 106 km3; such a large deposit might have been emplaced in periodic eruptions over an interval of 500 million years.

Inverted relief The lower portion (member) of Medusae Fossae Formation contains many patterns and shapes that are thought to be the remains of streams. It is believed that streams formed valleys that were filled and became resistant to erosion by cementation of minerals or by the gathering of a coarse covering layer to form an inverted relief. These inverted stream beds are sometimes called sinuous ridges or raised curvilinear features. They have been divided into six classes: flat-crested, narrow- crested, round-crested, branching, non-branching, and multilevel. They may be a kilometer or so in length. Their height ranges from a meter to greater than 10 meters, while the width of the narrow ones is less than 10 meters. Image:Sinuous Ridges in Medusae Formation.jpgSinuous Ridges within a branching fan in lower member of Medusae Fossae Formation, as seen by HiRISE. Location is Aeolis quadrangle. Yardangs The surface of the formation has been eroded by the wind into a series of linear ridges called yardangs. These ridges generally point in direction of the prevailing winds that carved them, and demonstrate the erosive power of Martian winds. The easily eroded nature of the Medusae Fossae Formation suggests that it is composed of weakly cemented particles, and was most likely formed by the deposition of wind-blown dust or volcanic ash. Yardangs are parts of rock that have been sand blasted into long, skinny ridges by bouncing sand particles blowing in the wind.http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_039563_1730 Layers are seen in parts of the formation. A resistant caprock on the top of yardangs has been observed in Viking, Mars Global Surveyor, and HiRISE photos. Images from spacecraft show that they have different degrees of hardness probably because of significant variations in the physical properties, composition, particle size, and/or cementation. Very few impact craters are visible throughout the area so the surface is relatively young.http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20020416a Image:Medusae Fossae Formation.jpgMedusae Fossae Formation as seen with Mars Odyssey's THEMIS.

The line, approximately long, was also sometimes referred to as the Micklehurst Loop and the Stalybridge and Diggle Loop Line. Construction and opening The London and North Western Railway had built its line from Stalybridge to Huddersfield through Standedge tunnel between 1847 and 1849 and it opened on 1 August 1849 for through trains between Liverpool Lime Street, Manchester Victoria, Huddersfield and Leeds. The increasing number of passenger and goods trains on the route required a second single-bore tunnel to be built, opening in February 1871. A further growth in traffic required construction of a double-track tunnel which was completed in August 1894. To effectively serve the four railway tracks through the Standedge tunnels, an additional twin-track railway line was required. The original track had been built on the steep, western slopes of the Tame Valley making it difficult to add a second pair of tracks alongside, so the new line was built in parallel, along the eastern side of the valley and about one mile distant. The new line was completed in 1885. Passenger train service and stations Whilst the line had mainly been built with through goods trains in mind, the LNWR built four intermediate passenger stations on the line, all opening on 3 May 1886. The first out of Stalybridge was Staley and Millbrook; next was Micklehurst; the third station from Stalybridge was Friezland and the nearest to the junction at Diggle and the tunnel entrance was Uppermill. Passenger traffic in this sparsely populated Pennine valley was light. Micklehurst was closed to passengers on 1 May 1907; Staley and Millbrook on 1 November 1909; and Uppermill and Friezland stations on 1 January 1917. Goods train traffic The line had been built primarily to handle the many goods trains that ran between Lancashire and Yorkshire. A typical weekday in Autumn 1952 saw at least thirty-seven eastbound goods trains running into Yorkshire using the Micklehurst Loop and a similar number of westbound trains. The loop had easier gradients than the original line through Mossley and Greenfield and this caused most of the heavy goods trains to use it. Daily local freight trains called at each of the stations to shunt waggons in the goods yards until and after their closure to passengers, Uppermill closing for goods traffic on 15 June 1964. The section of the line from Diggle to Staley and Millbrook was closed to all traffic on 3 October 1966, with the remaining section from Stalybridge to Staley and Millbrook surviving for a few more years to serve Hartshead Power Station near the latter location. Present day The track was lifted soon after the lines closure in the 1960s although the vast majority of the original trackbed is now part of the Pennine Bridleway. Royal George tunnel between Greenfield and Micklehurst was buried with both portals landscaped soon after the line closure. The demolition of the Greenfield viaduct and other bridges in the area was completed in 1979. Butterhouse tunnel between Uppermill and Diggle remains intact although the Southern Uppermill portal was backfilled and landscaped in the late 1980s. The Northern portal in Diggle has been untouched since the lines closure. Most of the station buildings along the route remain intact.

Gilbert was born in Plymouth in 1864. His father was a school teacher. Slater studied economics and worked as a professor. In 1909, he was appointed principal of Ruskin College and served from 1909 to 1915. From 1915 to 1921, Slater served as the Professor of Economics at the University of Madras. Slater died in 1938 at the age of 73. Slater is known for rural developments he initiated in India. Slater is also known for his love for Dravidian culture and civilization and for theorizing that the works of Shakespeare were actually written by several different writers at different times.  Early life  Slater was born at Plymouth, England on 27 August 1864 to a schoolmaster, Daniel Slater.  Academic career  Slater graduated in economics and taught the subject as an academic. He wrote one of the first Phds at the London School of Economics. Enclosure of Common Fields in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries was published in 1905. (LSE Magazine Winter 2010)  Principal of Ruskin College  Slater served as the Principal of Ruskin College, Oxford from 1909 to 1915.  In India  In 1915, Slater sailed to India to take over as the first Professor of economics and head of the new economics department of the University of Madras which was founded in 1912. and chaired the economics department of Madras University from 1915 to 1921. Even before he arrived in India, Slater had learnt the Tamil language and was ready for his new assignment. During his tenure, Gilbert and his team performed a detailed survey of the villages in the Madras Presidency and analyzed the prevailing economic conditions. One of the people who assisted Slater in his study was South Indian businessman M. Ct. Muthiah Chettiar. The results of the survey were published in the book Some South Indian Villages. During his tenure, Slater worked hard to eradicate poverty. Slater also demonstrated a keen interest in the culture and civilization of South India. Back in England in 1924, he published his book The Dravidian Elements in Indian Culture. Slater was nominated to the Madras Legislative Council in 1921 and served for a year until his return to the United Kingdom in 1922.Dravidian, Pg 174Southern India, Pg 7 During his term in the council, he recommended the appointment of a committee to investigate the feasibility of the adoption of a common script for the whole Presidency. Slater's motion was, however, defeated by a huge margin. On the choice of medium of instruction, he wrote: Slater co-authored the book Indigenous Banking in India along with L. C. Jain in 1929.  The Seven Shakespeares  Back in England, Slater studied Shakespeare and proposed a new variation of theory that the works attributed to Shakespeare were not his. In The Seven Shakespeares (1931) he argued that the works were actually written by seven different authors: Francis Bacon, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, Sir Walter Raleigh, William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, Christopher Marlowe, Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke, and Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland. This so- called \\"group theory\\" revived Delia Bacon's early model of collaborative authorship and brought together all the most popular recent candidates.  Death  Slater died on 8 March 1938 at the age of 73. He had married, in 1897, Violet, daughter of Joseph Oakeshott, of East Barnet, and Eliza Maria, n√©e Dodd; she was a sister of the civil servant and Fabian Joseph Francis Oakeshott.Radical Reformers and Respectable Rebels: How the two lives of Grace Oakeshott defined an era, Jocelyn Robson, Palgrave Macmillan, 2016, p. xviiFull of Hope and Fear: The Great War Letters of an Oxford Family, ed.

From 2006 to 2007 she was part of the Constituent Assembly as a constituent of the Movement for Socialism, where she took dissenting and critical positions. =Activism against Evo Morales= Loyola subsequently assumed a critical stance against the government of Evo Morales. In January 2009, she voted NO in the 2009 Bolivian constitutional referendum, giving her reasons at a press conference in the city of La Paz. In September 2013, as a member of the Foro de la Ciudadan√≠a Democr√°tica, she signed an agreement to build the \\"Frente Amplio\\" (Broad Front) against Evo Morales, of which she became a spokesperson. The group consisted of 5 organizations including the National Unity Front led by the businessman Samuel Doria Medina.

She blamed the MAS government for dividing and polarizing Bolivia stating \\"This government has managed to divide us, it has put indigenous against non- indigenous, poor against rich\\". She also called Evo Morales \\"a coward\\" for leaving the country, and furthermore said that if there had indeed been a coup Morales should've stayed in the country resisting with the people and not ask his base to \\"go out and get themselves killed or tell them to go out to kill\\".

The alliance of 34 companies unsuccessfully claimed that iiNet authorised primary copyright infringement by failing to take reasonable steps to prevent its customers from downloading and sharing infringing copies of films and television programs using BitTorrent.iiNet sued over BitTorrent piracy, 20 November 2008. Retrieved 23 January 2009 The trial court delivered judgment on 4 February 2010, dismissing the application and awarding costs to iiNet. An appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court was dismissed by Emmett and Nicholas JJ (Jagot J dissenting). A subsequent appeal to the High Court was unanimously dismissed on 20 April 2012. This case is important in Australian copyright law because it tests copyright law changes required in the Australia‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement, and set a precedent for future law suits about the responsibility of Australian Internet service providers with regards to copyright infringement via their services. Background The case against iiNet was filed on 20 November 2008.Notice of Filing and Hearing in the Federal Court of Australia . Retrieved 23 January 2009. Speaking on behalf of Village Roadshow, Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Disney Enterprises, Inc., the Seven Network and others, AFACT claimed that iiNet \\"had ignored requests from the companies to discipline its customers for breaking copyright laws.\\" The managing director of iiNet, Michael Malone, claimed that \\"iiNet cannot disconnect a customer's phone line based on an allegation. The alleged offence needs to be pursued by the police and proven in the courts. iiNet would then be able to disconnect the service as it had been proven that the customer had breached our Customer Relations Agreement,\\" The film companies' representative, AFACT, had conducted investigations into peer-to-peer-file-sharing network BitTorrent and found evidence that iiNet users had infringed the film companies' copyright. As of July 2008, AFACT sent notices to iiNet, providing information that iiNet users were using BitTorrent to infringe the copyright of the film companies. However, those notices had not enclosed AFACT's methodology. AFACT requested that iiNet prevent its users from infringing copyright through the suspension or termination of accounts of relevant users. The ISP did not act on AFACT's request, stating that, while copyright infringement was not approved, iiNet was not liable to take action on the basis of allegations. On a directions hearing on 6 February 2009 AFACT claimed that the three major issues were; whether iiNet authorized the acts of infringement, whether iiNet was liable for the actions of its customers and whether the safe harbor provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 protected iiNet. In February 2009, iiNet revealed that it had received legal assistance from its competitor, Telstra. In March 2009, Broadband Minister Stephen Conroy commented on iiNet's defence. Conroy said in response to iiNet as having \\"no idea if any customers are illegally downloading music\\" that this defence was \\"stunning\\" and \\"a classic\\". The Shadow Communications Minister Nick Minchin criticised the Minister for publicly discussing an active case and suggested he was deflecting attention away from proposed mandatory internet filtering. More than A$1 million was paid to iiNet for legal costs in developing a defence that was not needed after AFACT made an adjustment to their claim. AFACT removed a claim called conversion which suggested iiNet was using copyright to its own advantage by allegedly allowing customers to illegally download copyrighted material. These changes also delayed the court case because iiNet was awarded more time to amend their defence. Arguments The plaintiffs, who are represented by Tony Bannon SC, started by arguing that iiNet is failing to enforce its own user agreements which stipulate that users are not to illegally download files. Early in the proceedings Bannon claimed that \\"there were 94,942 instances of iiNet customers making available online unauthorised copies\\" of movies during a 59-week period from 23 June 2008. On day three it was revealed that iiNet received 1,356 notices requesting \\"takedown\\" action against customers, from various sources in a one-week period in early December 2008. General counsel Richard Cobden argued that \\"Acting on [all these] notifications is simply unreasonable and burdensome and inappropriate\\". Judgement The trial judge, Justice Cowdroy of the Federal Court, found in favour of iiNet, dismissing the case with costs. The finding claimed that AFACT had misled the court in regard to the number of infringing users, and, while iiNet users did infringe, this was not the responsibility of iiNet to deal with: > iiNet is not responsible if an iiNet user uses that system to bring about > copyright infringement ... the law recognises no positive obligation on any > person to protect the copyright of anotherAsher Moses (4 February 2010). > iiNet slays Hollywood in landmark piracy case. The Age. Fairfax Media. It was also found that iiNet had in place an \\"anti-piracy policy\\" and while that was not up to the standards demanded of them by AFACT, it was considered acceptable to the court that iiNet did not authorise copyright infringing activities on their network. Justice Cowdroy found that the provision of internet access by iiNet was not the \\"means\\" of infringement. Rather, the \\"means\\" was the exploitation of BitTorrent, which iiNet had no control over, in a deliberate manner to infringe copyright.\\"Federal Court decision on iiNet vs. film and television studios\\" [2010] Australian Copyright Council. Justice Cowdroy determined that iiNet did not have adequate power to prevent users from performing unlawful downloads and had not sanctioned, approved or countenanced copyright infringement. Since iiNet does not have control over the BitTorrent network, and the ISP Safe Harbour provisions apply, iiNet could not be held responsible for anything done by its users on the network. Additional comments One of iiNet's witnesses in the case was iiNet Managing Director and CEO, Michael Malone. Justice Cowdroy was invited by the applicants to find that Malone was not a credible witness, being neither truthful nor reliable. In a sharp rejection of this submission, Justice Cowdroy held (at 132‚Äì133): > 132\\\\. The applicants have mounted a vigorous challenge to the credibility of > Mr Malone, asserting that he was neither a truthful nor reliable witness. It > has been submitted that the Court should not rely on his evidence except > where it is against his interests or it is independently corroborated. It is > submitted that Mr Malone was determined to advocate the respondent's cause > at every opportunity and where he sensed a conflict between that cause and > the truth, he was prepared to subordinate the latter in favour of the > former. > 133\\\\. The Court rejects the attack on the credit of Mr Malone. Mr Malone was > an impressive witness who remained consistent (for the most part) in the > evidence he gave during three days of gruelling and unnecessarily hostile > cross-examination. Consequences As a result of this outcome, the court has set a precedent stating that ISPs are not responsible for what their users do with the services the ISPs provide them. Costs for the trial were awarded to iiNet as part of the ruling. AFACT has previously indicated it will appeal an adverse judgment. It is believed that this ruling will have substantial ramifications internationally in regards to dealing with copyright infringers on an ISP level.Tim Lohman (4 February 2010). iiNet outcome of global significance: Budde. Computerworld. IDG Communications. Retrieved 29 December 2011. In a statement released by the executive director of AFACT, Neil Gain, the copyright organization has 21 days to appeal the judgement. However, they are looking towards lobbying the government instead to have laws change to place responsibility for copyright protection in the hands of the ISPs themselves. Sabiene Heindl, the general manager for the copyright enforcement arm of the music industry, MIPI, has stated that as a result of this case, MIPI has no choice but to sue individual copyright infringers directly. It was believed that the government, in particular then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Communications Minister Stephen Conroy would attempt to introduce legislation into parliament to modify laws regarding this case to prevent ISPs from using the safe harbour provisions as an excuse to avoid protecting copyright.Trevor Clarke (9 February 2010). Rudd non-committal on copyright law change chances. Computerworld. IDG Communication. Retrieved 29 December 2011. However, Conroy released a statement saying that he has no plans to push for such an amendment and for ISPs and AFACT to have a \\"mature\\" approach to dealing with copyright enforcement. Appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court AFACT appealed to the full bench of the Federal Court, and was dismissed on 24 February 2011.Josh Taylor (25 February 2011). iiNet win puts onus on ISPs: lawyers. ZDNet. CBS Interactive. Retrieved 29 December 2011.. The majority of the Full Court stated that liability was not established as the copyright owners had not provided sufficient information and verification to support their allegations. Justices Emmett and Nicholas found that iiNet had not authorised the infringement of copyright, with Justice Jagot dissenting. However Justice Emmett made additional comment: > While the evidence supports a conclusion that iiNet demonstrated a > dismissive and, indeed, contumelious, attitude to the complaints of > infringement by the use of its services, its conduct did not amount to > authorisation of the primary acts of infringement on the part of iiNet > users. Since the decision has been released, notable Australian intellectual property law academics David Brennan,http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and- culture/iinets-hollow-victory-over-hollywood-20110225-1b7qa.html and Kimberlee Weatherall have suggested the outcome is not very favourable for ISPs. Key findings which were established in the appellant court were: * Justice Emmett, and Justice Jagot, found that ISPs can be found liable for authorising their users for infringement under specific circumstances. * Account holders were liable for infringements on the customer account in the context of disconnection due to repeat copyright infringement. [s 116AH, item 1]. * ISPs were not afforded protection under the Telecommunications Act * 112E of the Copyright Act 1968 (known colloquially as the facilities defense), and one which equated an ISP to Australia Post and often cited by groups such as the Internet Industry Association and other supporters was found by the trial judge and all three appellant judges as not a valid defense. * All three appellant justices, found that iiNet would not have been afforded protection under the \\"Safe Harbours\\" negotiated in the copyright act, as they did not have a policy to deal which allowed for termination of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances. The Full Court's judgement was followed by negotiations for legislative and industry-based solutions to resolve the issue of online copyright infringement, but these had not reached a conclusion by the time of the subsequent High Court appeal decision in 2012. =Authorisation of infringement= Joint judgement Two judges (Justices Emmett and Nicholas) upheld Justice Cowdroy's conclusion that iiNet did not authorise copyright infringement, however, their reasoning differed from that of Justice Cowdroy. The joint judgement decided that although iiNet showed an indifferent attitude to the film companies' complaints and requests, iiNet's inaction did not indicate an authorisation of primary acts of copyright infringement. The majority found that iiNet had the technical power to prevent infringement activities by suspending or terminating relevant user accounts.Odette, Gourley; Wen, H. Wu (March 2011)\\"Corrs in Brief: Roadshow Films v iiNet (Full Court appeal) ‚Äì ISP not liable for authorising copyright infringement (but only just!)\\" . Retrieved 20 October 2011. It was recognized that iiNet had a technical and contractual relationship with users whereby each user had agreed not to use the internet service to infringe copyright. The majority held that it was unreasonable for iiNet to act on AFACT's request for iiNet to suspend or terminate certain services given that AFACT had not provided sufficiently credible, verifiable and cogent evidence.Condon, Wayne; Farrell Geraldine (28 February 2011) \\"iiNet survives second round of copyright litigation ‚Äì but only just\\". Griffith Hack. Retrieved 20 October 2011. Justices Emmett and Nicholas accepted iiNet's argument that the data sent by AFACT required extensive analysis in order to identify allegedly infringing users and to obtain details of infringement activities. It was acknowledged that such extensive analysis would be onerous to iiNet, and hence unnecessary for iiNet to engage in. Jagot J Justice Jagot inferred that iiNet was liable for authorising primary infringements. Justice Jagot established her conclusion on certain findings including that iiNet knew a considerable proportion of BitTorrent traffic involved copyright infringement. Her Honour held that: > iiNet had a range of measures available to it, including warning customers, > blocking sites or ports, and suspending or terminating the account of a > customer whose account was found to have been involved in infringements of > copyright. It was possible to warn a customer that an infringement, by use > of the service provided to that customer, had been detected. Justice Jagot held that AFACT supplied iiNet with credible evidence of extensive and repeated infringements, contrasting the findings of the majority. Justice Jagot considered that iiNet regularly identified its users in distinction to their IP addresses in several contexts including when users did not pay service charges. =Facilitators of communications= iiNet relied on Section 112E of the Australian Copyright Act 1968, to argue that it merely provided the facilities which its users have allegedly exploited to infringe copyright. Following Cooper v Universal Music,. the majority decided that under section 112E the mere provision of communications facilities do not, by themselves, identify the ISP as an authoriser of infringement. The majority held that if authorisation had occurred, section 112E did not constitute an acceptable defence for iiNet. =Telecommunications Act defence= iiNet claimed that under section 276 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth), which prevents the disclosure and use of protected information, prohibited it from taking action on AFACT's notices.. The Full Court rejected this argument as statutory exceptions would apply. =Limitation on remedies= The \\"safe harbour provisions\\" in Part V, Division 2AA of the Copyright Act limits remedies available against ISPs for copyright infringement on their networks. The Full Court rejected Justice Cowdroy's statement that iiNet internal policy was a \\"repeat infringer policy\\".Gilchrist, Sue (25 February 2011) \\"iiNet not liable for users‚Äô copyright infringement ... this time\\". Freehills. Retrieved 20 October 2011. The decision was based on the fact iiNet did not develop processes to establish the policy, nor notify its users about the policy. The majority held that if authorisation occurred, iiNet was not protected by the \\"safe harbour\\" provisions. =Reaction to the appeal judgement= Significance The Full Court expressed that ISPs should be \\"cautious\\" before acting on detailed information provided by other parties apart from the party to the customer relationship agreement (CRA) where notices produced are above the quality of unreliable allegations of copyright infringement.Pinder, Kylie (March 2011)\\"Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Limited (2011) FCAFC 23\\". Gaden Lawyers Brisbane. Retrieved 20 October 2011. Justice Emmett suggested that if copyright owners were to pursue ISPs for authorising infringement, they would need to show the following conditions were accepted: * \\"iiNet has been provided with unequivocal and cogent evidence of the alleged primary acts of infringement by use of the iiNet service in question\\"; and * to reimburse iiNet for the reasonable cost of verifying the particulars of the primary acts of infringement alleged and of establishing and maintaining [an infringement monitoring regime]; and * to indemnify iiNet in respect of any liability reasonably incurred by iiNet as a consequence of mistakenly suspending or terminating a service on the basis of allegations made by the Copyright Owner.\\" ISP response Following the ruling, several major Australian ISPs have refined their approach to copyright infringement warnings. Exetel has revised their policy of blocking Internet access, of users who receive infringement notices, until the organization receives an acknowledgment that the infringement was received by the end user.Ben Grubb (9 February 2010). Exetel changes piracy policy. ZDNet. CBS Interactive. Instead, Exetel will now simply forward the infringement notice to the end user and not interfere with their connection. Optus, Australia's second largest ISP has provided a similar modification in their copyright policing, claiming they will not reprimand or otherwise penalise users who perform copyright infringement on their networks as well.Ben Grubb (9 February 2010). Optus won't reprimand pirating users. ZDNet. CBS Interactive. Industry copyright code for ISPs The AFACT has welcomed the Internet Industry Association's (IIA) development of an industry code of practice to guide courts on what actions internet intermediaries (such as ISPs or other content hosts) should undertake in response to copyright infringement claims.Corner, Stuart (11 March 2011) \\"IIA to fast track development of copyright code of conduct\\" iTwire.

The appeal addressed whether the Full Federal Court deviated in its application of the principles of authorisation and subsequently, whether the finding that iiNet did not authorise its users' copyright infringements is incorrect. The appeal also focused on whether the Full Court erred in its treatment of the amount of knowledge iiNet required to know before infringement could be validated.\\"High Court to hear iiNet appeal case in December\\" [2011] Australian Copyright Council In a judgment on 20 April 2012, the High Court unanimously dismissed AFACT's appeal and ordered AFACT to pay costs, with iiNet's gross legal expenses said to be approximately $9 million.(20 April 2012). iiNet wins landmark copyright case . iiNet.

He was chiefly associated with the Chicago blues style of amplified harmonica, but also incorporated elements of jump blues, swing, and soul jazz into his playing. Clarke was a master of both cross and chromatic harmonica styles and many consider him among the blues harmonica greats. Biography Clarke was born in Inglewood, California, on March 21, 1951. In 1967, he began playing harmonica and was soon performing in Los Angeles-area clubs. He struck up an association with blues harmonica virtuoso George \\"Harmonica\\" Smith and the two began playing regularly together in 1977; their partnership lasted until Smith died in 1983. In 1978, Clarke recorded his first album, Hittin' Heavy. Other albums on small labels followed, including Blues from Los Angeles (1980) and Can't You Hear Me Calling (1983). Los Angeles blues musicians Hollywood Fats, Junior Watson, and others backed Clarke for two of his 1980s albums on Satch and Rivera Records, which are now considered classics. From 1985 to 1988, he toured with Rick Holmstrom. His 1987 album Tip of the Top was nominated for a W.C. Handy Award. Clarke sent a demo tape to Alligator Records, who subsequently offered him a recording contract. Blowin' Like Hell, his debut for Alligator, was released in 1990, and he followed the release with international touring. \\"Must Be Jelly\\", a song from the album, won a Handy award for \\"Blues Song of the Year\\". Several well-received albums for Alligator followed; 1996's The Hard Way received a Handy award for \\"Best Contemporary Blues album\\". Clarke's lifestyle and constant touring led to health problems. After collapsing onstage in Indianapolis, Indiana, he took steps to improve his health. However, he died after a performance in Fresno, California, on November 2, 1996.

The collected individual has a length of 210 centimetre and the body which consists of 600 single segments is 24 millimetre in diameter. Along with Amynthas mekongianus (Cognetti, 1922) and Megascolides australis, Rhinodrilus fafner is among the largest known giant earthworms. Rhinodrilus fafner was confined to a small habitat and vanished possibly due to habitat destruction. It was officially declared extinct by the Brazilian Ministry of Environment (MMA) in 2003. However, the rediscoveries of the Giant Palouse earthworm in 2005 and the Brazilian earthworm Fimoscolex sporadochaetus in 2007 created hope that Rhinodrilus fafner may be found again.

Sir Thomas Townsend Bucknill (18 April 1845 ‚Äì 4 October 1915) was an English judge of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, a Member of Parliament and a Privy Councillor.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition Biography 'Tommy' Bucknill was born at Exminster in 1845, the second son of Sir John Charles Bucknill, an asylum doctor and psychiatrist who was knighted in 1894 in recognition of his services as one of the founders of the Volunteer Movement. Thomas Bucknill was educated at Westminster School and afterwards at Geneva. He was called to the bar in 1868, became a Queen's Counsel in 1885, and a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1891. From 1885 to 1899 he was Recorder of Exeter. He edited The Cunningham Reports and Sir S. Cook's Common Pleas Reports, and was a leading Counsel on the Admiralty Circuit and on the Western Circuit.Bucknill in The New York Times 16 January 1899 He sat as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Epsom from 1892 to 1899, in which year he was raised to the bench, succeeding Sir Henry Hawkins, and was knighted. In 1914 he was appointed a Privy Councillor. Bucknill was a prominent Freemason, having been initiated in 1873 into Lodge of Good Report No.136 and becoming the Provincial Grand Master for Surrey from 1903 to 1915.Bucknill in MQ Magazine 16 January 2006 Among the notable cases tried before Bucknill was that in 1912 of poisoner Frederick Seddon, who, on being found guilty of murder appealed directly to Bucknill as a brother Mason and in the name of 'The Great Architect Of The Universe' to overturn the jury's verdict. According to some sources he gave the First Degree sign, according to others the Sign of Grief and Distress, begging for mercy. Bucknill is reported as having said, with some emotion: > \\"It is not for me to harrow your feelings ‚Äì try to make peace with your > Maker. We both belong to the same Brotherhood, and though that can have no > influence with me this is painful beyond words to have to say what I am > saying, but our Brotherhood does not encourage crime, it condemns it.\\" Bucknill died at Epsom on 4 October 1915.

He began his career playing for his hometown club Middlesbrough, making his professional debut in April 1984. The club endured severe financial trouble during this period but Gill was part of the side that won consecutive promotions in 1987 and 1988 to reach the First Division before suffering a broken leg in 1989. He made just one further appearance for the club before joining Darlington in 1989, following a loan spell with Hull City. He later played for Cardiff City, winning the Welsh Cup in 1992, before retiring at the age of 28 due to injury. After working as a coach in the United States, Gill joined Gateshead as assistant manager before taking control of the team in February 2002 following the resignation of Paul Proudlock. He resigned from the role eight months later. After a serious car accident left him disabled, he gave up coaching and returned to his former club Middlesbrough as a scout before being made the club's head of UK recruitment. Early life Born in Middlesbrough, Gill attended Archibald Primary School, Acklam Whin Primary School and Stainby School as a child. He grew up supporting his hometown club Middlesbrough and attended matches at Ayresome Park with his father. Playing career After representing his school and county teams, Gill signed for Middlesbrough as an apprentice at the age of sixteen. After progressing through the club's youth system, he was handed his professional debut in April 1984 by caretaker-manager Jack Charlton, coming on as a substitute during a match against Swansea City. He made his full debut a week later, starting a match against Charlton Athletic, however his appearances for the club were limited as he struggled with injuries, including having two discs removed from his back at the age of nineteen. After a brief loan spell at Hull City, playing one match at the end of the 1983‚Äì84 season, he featured in the 1986 squad, helping the club's survival from liquidation during which players were left unpaid for several months. The squad went on to win consecutive promotions, moving from the Third Division to the First Division. In April 1989, Gill suffered a broken leg during a match against Southampton but carried on playing, stating \\"The physio then was Tommy Johnson. He knew how desperate I was to stay on the pitch.\\" Johnson gave Gill the magic sponge and told him \\"it is a battle, run it off.\\" Despite his desire to continue, the injury eventually began causing him severe pain and he was substituted. He returned from injury and played one further match for Middlesbrough against Plymouth Argyle. Gill eventually left Middlesbrough having made 97 appearances in all competitions after falling out with manager Bruce Rioch. He went to play for another local team Darlington who were managed by Gill's former coach at Middlesbrough, Brian Little. After helping the side win promotion into the Football League, he was part of the squad that won the Fourth Division title during the 1990‚Äì91 season. In February 1992, he joined Cardiff City, making his debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Scunthorpe United on 14 March 1992. He made five further league appearances, scoring once during a 3‚Äì0 victory over Wrexham, and played in the club's 1992 Welsh Cup final victory over Hednesford Town before being released at the end of the season. Gill later commented that he struggled for fitness during his time with Cardiff and persistent injuries led to his retirement from playing after leaving the club at the age of 28. Managerial and coaching career Following his retirement, Gill travelled to the United States to take up a position coaching high school students in San Diego. Gill later worked as assistant manager to Paul Proudlock at Gateshead. In February 2002, he was appointed manager of the club following the resignation of Proudlock. Gill attempted to convince Proudlock to remain with the club but accepted the job when he refused. He resigned from his position in October 2002 when he was forced to cut players wages that resulted in him breaking a guarantee he had made to his squad. Gill later joined BBC Radio Cleveland, replacing his former teammate Paul Kerr providing match commentaries for Middlesbrough matches and was eventually given a regular column for BBC Tees entitled \\"Gilly's View\\". He also worked as a buyer for a men's clothing brand and owned the Chadwick's Inn pub in Maltby. In October 2011, Gill returned to Middlesbrough as a European scout for manager Tony Mowbray in an attempt to widen the club's scouting network. Following Mowbray's sacking, Gill was moved to a new role as head of UK recruitment following the appointment of Aitor Karanka and was placed in charge of opposition scouting and the club's scouting network. Personal life In 2002, Gill was seriously injured after being involved in a car accident on the A67 when a van hit another car before colliding with Gill's car. Gill suffered a smashed left knee, a collapsed lung, a broken shoulder and a fractured neck, leaving him permanently disabled after losing full use of his left leg. He later stated that the accident had left him unable to continue his career as a football coach, commenting \\"I had wanted to become a top coach and I just feel like that opportunity has been taken away from me.\\" The driver of the van was killed and his employer later accepted liability for the accident after it was revealed that he had been working longer hours than the law permits drivers to work.

Publishing under managing editor Jennifer Cowan, the Trentonian has won numerous provincial and national news awards through the Ontario Community Newspapers Association and the Canadian Community Newspapers Association. Early history For over a half-century, the Trentonian has been the voice of record for the former town of Trenton, Ontario and the current city of Quinte West and its surrounding communities. Founded in 1956 and merged with the Brighton Ensign (founded 1871) by Senator W.A. Fraser, the Trentonian eventually absorbed the Trenton Courier Advocate (founded 1853) in the early 1960s to create a larger tri-weekly newspaper as a fresher alternative to the historical weeklies. In its first editions, before it moved to a new location at 41 Quinte Street, state-of-the-art equipment and a working press were located in the rear of the building - printing was initially done in Picton, but getting started proved difficult. The paper's first editor-reporter-photographer, James M. Muir, recalled \\"We were ensconced in a vacated furniture store in downtown Trenton, deep in planning the most awkward newspaper operation with which I've ever been associated.\\" Despite these hardships, Muir said The Trentonian was readily welcomed by readers because it carried local news photos, something the Courier-Advocate had still not caught onto; he noted that the Trentonian's initial appeal may have been due to its more extensive coverage of the Royal Canadian Air Force base near town. The Trentonian eventually formed a four-page base section distributed with Dominion grocery store flyers, which proved so successful that the Trentonian's owners were able to buy out the Courier-Advocate once and for all. Ownership Years passed, and the paper left the hands of the James family and was sold to Ken Thomson, newspaper baron, who after more than 20 years of ownership passed the paper on to fellow newspaper mogul Conrad Black in 1997, becoming part and parcel of the Hollinger Newspapers Group. In the summer of 2001 the Trentonian, along with 29 other newspapers in Ontario, was purchased from Hollinger by Michael Sifton and Osprey Media Group Inc.. In the summer of 2007, the Sun Media Corporation wing of Quebecor Inc. purchased Osprey and changed its full name to Osprey Media Publishing Inc., which now owns the Trentonian, the Belleville Intelligencer, the County Weekly News of Picton and the Community Press of Stirling. Today, the Quinte area papers all fall under Sun Media's banner. In 2015, Sun Media was acquired by Postmedia.

Among these the temerarious sinking of German military ships in the harbor of Oslo (Operation Mardonius), described in the Norwegian Resistance hero Max Manus' book \\"Det vil helst g√• godt\\" and in the movie Max Manus: Man of War.

The sentence was strongly criticized in juridical as well as in political circles in Norway, and the Riis couple felt they had been betrayed by a biased juridical system too close to the shipping circles (Dagbladet 1975 and Kapital 1975). The trials were a heavy toll on the family. The aviation business in Rome folded due to the Riis' need to constantly travel back to Norway in order to attend court proceedings, and to the legal costs involved. Consul Einar Riis fought the rest of this life trying to overcome this injustice. The \\"Amelia Riis inheritance case\\" had by then become quite famous in the media, and was discussed in the Norwegian Storting (Parliament). The verdict was appealed, and several legal case started against the Norwegian Government and the DNC bank. All initiatives seemed to be vain, and the Riis couple became more and more frustrated about the Norwegian legal system, while encountering severe economic difficulties. It was at this time that the Riis' were approached by the young - seemingly \\"idealistic\\" - law student Herman Berge. He assisted the Riis' in obtaining \\"free legal assistance\\" and a prestigious law firm in Oslo accepted the challenge of pursuing the Riis case against the Norwegian authorities. Finally in 2001, in the case against the Norwegian Government for its mismanagement of the inheritance assets the Oslo District Court (Oslo Tingrett) awarded Riis 10 million Norwegian krone, the largest indemnity of this kind ever granted in Norway. The Olsen & Ugelstad's assets had in fact been allowed to \\"disappear\\" under the eyes of the Probate Court which was responsible for preserving the disputed inheritance until a final verdict had taken place. With interest, the total award was at 43 million krone.Verdict in the Amelia Riis case in 2001 The Norwegian Minister of justice, Odd Einar D√∏rum decided not to appeal .Amelia Riis dolket i ryggenAmelia Riis inng√•r forlik dn.no April 12, 2002 As he later mentioned in a TV2 interview, maybe he wished the ageing Riis couple could enjoy a serene retirement after all the years of injustice.  The Riis ‚Äì Herman Berge controversy  Consul Einar Riis was not ready to retire yet. Revived by Herman Berge's fresh support and legal assurances that an indemnity from the State of over 500 mill. $ was within reach, new legal case were started. Unfortunately Consul Einar Riis could not see the outcome of these efforts, as he died while on a short vacation in Arvika, Sweden. With her children living abroad, the almost 80-year-old widow Mrs. Amelia Riis became even more dependent upon Mr. H. Berge. In the aftermath of the 2001 sentence, Mr. Herman Berge had gained some notoriety in Norwegian media as Riis' spokesman and \\"legal advisor\\", although not being directly involved in the outcome of the legal case. Herman Berge's attitude towards Mrs. Amelia Riis changed radically shortly after Einar's death.Jurist amok med d√∏dsbo He started demanding increasingly amounts of money and, when these were questioned, Berge threatened to \\"freeze\\" the estate proceedings taking place in Monaco where the Riis's were resident. . Mrs. Amelia Riis felt as if she had been \\"stabbed in the back\\" by her and her husband \\"trusted\\" family friend and \\"juridical advisor\\". She soon calculated Herman Berge had received over 11 million Norwegian Crowns in forms of compensation, coverage of expenses, and even for dubious \\"investment projects\\" and felt Berge's claim to take control of all her remaining assets unjustified.Krever 28 millioner Nettavisen, May 8, 2007 Norwegian press was shocked by H.Berge's behaviour and several first page articles in authoritative newspapers covered the case (Finansavisen). Mrs. Amelia Riis took Mr. Berge's claims to the Court in Monaco, and in Norway. Herman Berge claimed to be a \\"creditor\\" to the estate, a \\"heir\\" and at the same time the \\"testamentary executor\\". ALL of Herman Berge's claims - economical, or of being a \\"heir\\", a \\"testamentary executor\\", or a \\"creditor\\"- were dismissed in several Court rulings in Norway, Sweden, and Monaco. Oslo Byfogd Court's sentence of 23 April 2007 stated Herman Berge had \\"manipulated\\" elderly Einar Riis and issued an \\"arrest\\" order against Berge's properties; Oslo Tingrett Court (= Oslo District Court) sentence of 14 December 2007 confirmed H. Berge had fraudulently obtained at least 8 million Norwegian Crowns from the Riis couple, and ordered the money paid back Manipulert til millionutbetalinger Nettavisen, May 9, 2007 Asker & Baerum District Court sentence of 25 September 2008 further dismissed Berge's claims. As soon as legal proceedings started against him in Norway, Mr. Berge swiftly decided to move to Luxembourg - probably to avoid liability. Norwegian TV2 interviewed him there (Amelia Riis p√• TV2 and TV2 Amelia Riis v. Herman Berge - round 3) Norwegian TV2 later interviewed another family claiming to have suffered the same \\"manipulatoy\\" attentions by Mr. Berge (TV2 - Amelia Riis v. Herman Berge).

He is best noted for the tracks \\"Blues at Midnight\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Walk Your Log\\". Life and career Leonard Caston Sr. was born in Sumrall, Mississippi, United States, and raised in Meadville, Mississippi, from age eight. He lived in Chicago from 1934 to 1936 but then moved back to Mississippi after his family relocated to Natchez. He learned to play piano under the influence of Leroy Carr and Art Tatum; he has also credited Andy Kirk, Jimmy Rogers, and his relative Kim Weathersby as stylistic influences. In 1938 he returned to Chicago, where he met with Mayo Williams, a producer for Decca Records. Williams recorded him in a trio with Eugene Gilmore and Arthur Dixon. Dixon introduced Caston to his brother, Willie Dixon. Caston, Willie Dixon, Jimmy Gilmore, Joe Bell, and Willie Hawthorne then formed the Five Breezes, a group in the style of the Ink Spots. In 1940, Caston recorded his first solo record for Decca, \\"The Death of Walter Barnes\\", with Robert Nighthawk on harmonica. The Five Breezes disbanded in 1941, and Caston began playing in the Rhythm Rascals Trio with Alfred Elkins and Ollie Crawford. The group did USO tours and in 1945 performed at a conference for Dwight Eisenhower, Bernard Montgomery, and Georgy Zhukov. After the war, Caston recorded under his own name and with Roosevelt Sykes and Walter Davis and performed in many studio sessions. He also recorded again with Dixon as the Four Jumps of Jive and the Big Three Trio, playing in both groups with Bernardo Dennis. Ollie Crawford joined this group soon after Dennis's departure. The Big Three Trio recorded for Columbia Records and Okeh Records. The Big Three Trio's last sides were recorded in 1952, but the group did not officially break up until 1956. Caston continued performing for decades afterwards, reuniting with Dixon to perform in 1984. Caston released an album, Baby Doo's House Party, shortly before his death of heart disease in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1987. His son, Leonard Caston, Jr., is an R&B; singer and songwriter, who sang with the Radiants, and wrote songs for Motown Records, among other endeavors.

The SCI works closely with the international community to discover ways to ensure that sustainable practices are adopted into commodity production and trade that enhance social, environmental and economic welfare on a global scale. The SCI was formed to facilitate the development of sustainable commodity production and trade sectors. The initiative works collaboratively with producers and producer organizations, voluntary sustainability initiatives (VSI's), the private sector, government institutions and development focussed NGO‚Äôs. The initiative receives project funding from numerous governments worldwide, United Nations agencies, foundations, the private sector and individual donors.  Activities  The SCI conducts targeted research on market impacts, facilities collaboration and information sharing across existing voluntary sustainability initiatives (VSI's) and facilitates policy and initiative development. Specific objectives include: * Improve stakeholder and policy decision making capacity through enhanced access to information on sustainability in commodity markets * Improve return on investment ratios for VSI's through enhanced efficiencies and economies of scale * Improve the poverty reduction abilities of VSI's through enhanced participation of rural stakeholders in initiative development * Improve the environmental impacts of voluntary initiatives through market growth and continual improvements Through ongoing multi-stakeholder consultation, the SCI identified five cross-cutting areas for the development of sustainable production practices across global supply chains, which include: *Supporting access to market information on sustainable products *Strengthening technical assistance for sustainable production *Improving access to finance for sustainable production *Strengthening the evidence base on impacts of sustainable products and supply chains *Facilitating the development of supportive policy for sustainable products and markets  Definition of voluntary sustainability initiatives  The SCI considers \\"voluntary sustainability initiatives\\" or \\"VSI's\\" to be any non-mandatory, rules based partnership or collaboration among multiple supply chain stakeholders aimed at improving the social, economic and environmental sustainability of commodity production and/or trade. Over the last decade, more than 20 new global VSI's have been established with the aim of leveraging market forces to promote sustainable development. Examples of operational VSI's include; Fairtrade, International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), Forest Stewardship Council, Marine Stewardship Council, The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, Global Compact, ISO 14000, Global Reporting Initiative, CERES PrinciplesCeres (organization) etc. Voluntary initiatives have the potential to bring many benefits to international trade sectors including: * Higher and more stable revenues through the identification of sustainable products and markets * Better farm and business management practices among rural producers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME's) * Improved stakeholder awareness of market trends * Reduced stakeholder risk exposure to market volatility * More efficient and strategic natural resource use * Improved consistency, quality and supply of products to consumers * Improved consumer awareness of producer conditions through private sector communication channels * Improved coordination and efficiency of supply chain management * Increased private sector investment for sustainable production and consumption VSI's also offer a vehicle for channelling a growing private sector interest in promoting sustainability towards common approaches and pooled investment. With the potential to create unified approaches and the economies of scale needed to bring about widespread change at the global level, voluntary supply-chain approaches are ready to establish a new paradigm for commodity production and trade. \\"Cross-cutting\\" initiatives seek to promote inter-initiative cooperation to improve efficiency, transparency and effectiveness within the sector. The growth in the number of NGO, government and industry led initiatives has increased the opportunities to promote sustainable practice in commodity sectors, but has also led to a multiplication of transaction and implementation costs that threaten the viability and impact of these approaches. Most initiatives have the potential to benefit considerably from shared learning and collaboration with service provision since they have similar objectives implement similar activities on the ground. Since the majority of voluntary initiatives focus on the practices of individual supply chain actors, a largely untapped global \\"macro\\" oriented approach to production poses new opportunities for the development of sustainable commodity supply chains. In addition to carrying out its own inter-initiatives collaboration, the SCI is either a participant or member of the following cross-cutting initiatives: * Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform * Sustainable Food Lab * International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling (ISEAL) Alliance * The World Bank's Trade Standards Practitioners Network The Trade Standards Practitioners Network provides detailed descriptions of major VSI's across commodity sectors worldwide.  SCI Projects  = Impact Assessment- COSA = The Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA) project is a multi-stakeholder led research consortium assessing the costs and benefits of sustainability standards. Recent growth in sustainable markets has created new opportunities for producers in developing countries to sell higher priced specialty products and create more stable trading relationships. The adoption of sustainable production methods and the entry into sustainable markets however, is becoming increasingly more complicated for producers and other supply chain actors to navigate, especially as the number of sustainability programs/processes and certification bodies grow. With a diverse range of sustainability programs to choose from, producers, consumers, policy-makers and companies lack independent, credible data on what it really means to become compliant with social, economic and environmental sustainability initiatives. To date, there is very little detailed information on the impacts of sustainability standards. Information is limited for example, on what costs and benefits producers experience when adopting compliance with any given sustainability initiative, and how much time it takes for producers to see returns on an investment in a particular sustainability initiative. Where information is available it is usually partial, often partisan and rarely based on comparable science-based methodologies. An apt analogy may be that we have designed a class of medicines but are not really certain of their full impact or to what extent they may have unintended side-effects. Since many standards are either requested or required by buyers in international markets, the need for improved information on field level impacts is urgent.Daniele Giovannucci and Jason Potts with B. Killian, C.Wunderlich, G. Soto, S. Schuller, F. Pinard, K. Schroeder, I. Vagneron. 2008. Seeking Sustainability: COSA Preliminary Analysis of Sustainability Initiatives in the Coffee Sector. Committee on Sustainability Assessment:Winnipeg, Canada. The Sustainable Commodity Initiative‚Äôs Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA) project was founded to strengthen the evidence base on the impacts of sustainable products and supply chains. COSA has developed a scientific methodology using multi- criteria analysis for gathering and understanding concrete, fact-based data on the outcomes associated with sustainability programs. The COSA executive committee includes the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), Nicaragua‚Äôs Centro Agron√≥mico Tropical de Investigaci√≥n y Ense√±anza (CATIE), Costa Rica‚Äôs [Centro de Inteligencia sobre Mercados Sostenibles] (CIMS/INCAE), France‚Äôs Centre de coop√©ration internationale en recherche agronomique pour le d√©veloppement (CIRAD) and Switzerland‚Äôs State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). This committee, with the endorsement of the International Coffee Organization and initial seed support from USAID, NORAD and BTC, worked with leading institutions in several producing countries to adapt and develop the COSA methodology. = Finance for Sustainable Trade - FAST = Created in 2007, the Finance Alliance for Sustainable Trade (FAST) is a member driven, non-profit international organization headquartered in Montreal, Canada. Its current membership base (over 100 members) represents Small and Medium Enterprise producer organizations, commercial and socially- oriented lenders, development focused NGOs, and other sustainable trade stakeholders. Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) producers have been identified as one of the most important drivers of economic growth and poverty reduction in developing countries. Sustainable SME producers are growing in number and are key drivers behind a global transition to sustainable trade. Currently, a major barrier facing the continued growth and development of SME's is the unmet need for external finance. Since entry into sustainable markets typically requires additional capital investment - many producers in developing countries simply cannot afford to invest in the transition. FAST's mission is to facilitate a global collaborative effort among its members to ensure continued growth of the sustainable trade sector. This is made possible by increasing the number of producers in developing countries who can successfully access affordable trade finance and longer-term loans, tailored to their business needs as they enter sustainable markets.Finance Alliance for Sustainable Trade website The SCI's role in the development of FAST dates back to 2003, when discussions among members of the SCI's Sustainable Coffee Partnership identified improving producer access to finance as a key strategy in achieving its core objectives of enabling the adoption of more sustainable practices across commodity markets. The SCI took the lead in convening FAST stakeholders at the Specialty Coffee Association of America's annual conference in 2005 and 2006 and continued to lead the process, along with steering committee participants, until FAST's formal establishment as a non- profit organization in 2007. Currently, the SCI and FAST work collaboratively on a number of projects. = Technical Assistance - SCAN = The Sustainable Commodity Assistance Network (SCAN) partnership is a multi-initiative platform led by the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI) and funded by HIVOS and Solidaridad. The goal of the SCAN partnership is to improve the livelihoods of rural commodity producers, workers and communities in developing countries by empower smallholder producer groups through focused technical assistance to undertake sustainable farm and business management practices and attain efficient entry into sustainable markets. SCAN will link the technical assistance efforts of VSI's through a common platform. SCAN is working with existing technical assistance providers, VSI's and development focussed NGO's to create a more cohesive global technical assistance platform that will address the following observations: *Market Growth: As markets for sustainable products continue to grow producers gain a unique opportunity to utilize a ‚Äòspecialty market' structure to sell higher priced products while also incorporating a high level of social and environmental integrity. Market growth for sustainable products has created an increased opportunity for producers to participate in specialty markets that ensure sustainable development impacts. This has created an increased need for larger-scale technical assistance delivery across a growing number of commodities and regions. * Overlap in Training Practices: There is a growing area of overlap between the objectives and implementation frameworks of different standards. Most initiatives now promote a similar set of social, health, economic and environmental standards and realize that insufficient attention has been given to product quality and the overall market implications. With the high transaction costs associated with the delivery of training and the depth of the technical assistance needed throughout commodity producing countries, there lies a clear opportunity to improve efficiency and scale. By reducing overlap and creating a collaborative network, initiatives will be better able to identify and implement best practice and create substantial administrative and cost savings. * Gaps in Business Training: Most technical assistance programs currently in place are topic specific and are often linked to a specific sustainability initiative. Similarly, existing training activities that these initiatives conduct often focus only on achieving compliance due to insufficient resources to go further. As a result, today very limited resources exist to train producers on how to manage a sustainable business and actively participate in international sustainable and specialty markets. By improving training to include modules on access to sustainable markets, marketing and risk management, producers will better able to take a more proactive role in planning and sales. * Quality Management Systems: There is a lack of coherence in quality management systems (QMS) procedures amongst most standards-based initiatives. Most initiatives allow group certification for organized smallholders on the condition that they apply some form of Internal Control System (ICS). At present, the ICS's required by the different standards bodies are neither standardized nor consistent and, more importantly, do not always promote a sound \\"business management\\" approach. One producer group should have only one ICS (or QMS) even if the group wishes to comply with more than one global standard. By ensuring that the technical assistance package delivered through SCAN includes comprehensive training on best practices in QMS, producers will improve their ability to successfully comply and gain improved market access. * Enhanced Producer Organization: Producer organization is often a prerequisite to enabling access to sustainable markets for smallholder producers. Compliance-based technical assistance strategies typically do not currently have the resources or tools to build the requisite organizational structures for producers. Also important is developing improved producer access and interaction with international markets, an approach which requires effective producer organization. Standards bodies agree that producer organization play a central role in enabling disadvantaged producers to benefits from sustainable markets. Specifically, SCAN technical assistance will have a particular focus on facilitating the organization of unorganized producers and improve the organizational capacity of existing organizations. * Lack of Resources: Comparatively little attention has been given by initiatives to support large-scale transition to sustainable production and management due to limited resources available to any one initiative. By pooling efforts and resources and expertise, SCAN is at the forefront of developing a program that supports the \\"mainstreaming\\" of sustainable commodity production and trade.SCI website = Reporting - State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI) = The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI) is a global initiative that will research and report on the impacts of market-based, voluntary approaches to sustainable commodity production and trade. The SSI is a knowledge-sharing programme that will improve information-sharing and transparency in voluntary supply chain initiatives through an independent annual reporting service and learning network. The SSI began in 2008 and is coordinated by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), AidEnvironment and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Over the past two decades a growing number of voluntary sustainability initiatives and other multi- stakeholder alliances have emerged to improve the livelihoods of the millions of commodity-dependent producers and manufacturers around the world. The growth of such initiatives represents an important opportunity for all stakeholders to participate in the greening of global supply chains and improvement of producer livelihoods. The multiplication of these initiatives makes it increasingly challenging for all stakeholders to stay abreast of the latest developments and best practices across the voluntary sector. Moreover, it is exceedingly difficult to assess their utility and performance, let alone the steps required to mainstream best practice. The reporting activities the SSI will enable stakeholders to interact with each other, helping them to benchmark performance and become more effective. The State of Sustainability Initiatives Annual Review will begin in 2009 and will provide a regular overview of the voluntary initiatives sector, including statistics, market trends, performance metrics in development and use, forward looking strategies. Each annual issue will focus on the relationship between voluntary sustainability initiatives and a key sustainable development theme.

In May 1995, Lawrence passed the \\"Simply Equal Amendment,\\" thus becoming the first city in Kansas to prohibit discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation. Simply Equal was formed in 1991 and was led by the newly organized Freedom Coalition. Active supporters were the Lawrence National Organization for Women chapter, the American Civil Liberties Union, the League of Women Voters, the Kansas University Ecumenical Christian Ministries, and the Kansas University LesBiGay Services group. Lynne Green and Ben Zimmerman were co-chairs of Simply Equal. Sidenote: Lawrence, Kansas actually became the second municipality in the state to adopt such legislation. Wichita, Kansas was the first in the 1970s. The Wichita anti-discrimination legislation was repealed in a referendum vote shortly after its installation. History =Background= Tension surrounding gay and lesbian issues had been mounting for years in Lawrence, in Kansas, and in the United States: In 1983 Kansas becomes the first state to amend its incest law specifically to make same-sex incest a crime. In 1986 the Lawrence City Commission refuses to acknowledge Gay and Lesbian Awareness Week. After complaints from the LGBT community, the Lawrence Department of Human Relations conducts a study which confirms local incidents of discrimination against gays and lesbians. They recommend that the words \\"sexual orientation\\" be added to the city's existing anti-discrimination ordinance. For two years, the issue will be left untouched. In 1988, pressured by the local group Citizens for Human Rights in Lawrence, the city commission decides to vote on adding sexual orientation to the City's existing anti- discrimination ordinance. Opposition exists from the Alliance of Citizens for Traditional Values, who state that the City's study does not prove discrimination. They argued that including \\"sexual orientation\\" would force local businesses to establish affirmative action for gays. Influenced by the religious right, the commission votes 3-2 against the proposed amendment. In 1989 the Christian Coalition of America is founded by Pat Robertson. =polarizing issue in the 1995 City Commission elections= On November 16, 1994, after more than two year's work, Simply Equal delivered copies of its report to City Hall with a cover letter requesting a study session and passage of the amendment. On January 18, 1995, over 100 people attended the study session at City Hall. Simply Equal co-chairs Lynne Green and Ben Zimmerman, together with Dennis Saleebey (chair of the KU task force on lesbian, bisexual, and gay concerns), spoke in favor of the amendment. Rev. Leo Barbee opposed it. At the end of the study session, City Commissioner Doug Compton presented the Commission with a list of 33 questions to which he would like answered before the amendment goes to a vote. Of the thirteen candidates who ran in the primary election, eight supported amending the Human Relations Ordinance to include sexual orientation (or Simply Equal). On February 28, the primary election narrowed the field to six candidates to run for three Commission seats in general election. The Freedom Coalition supported Lena Johnson (who lost), John Nalbandian (a current commissioner up for re-election who came in first), and Allen Levine (who finished sixth). Doug Compton, a current commissioner up for re-election and still undecided on Simply Equal, came in fourth after Bonnie Augustine and Jo Barnes, and just ahead of Carl Burkhead, all of whom opposed Simply Equal. In summary, a Simply Equal supporter received the most votes, followed by four Simply Equal opponents, and a sixth person who supported Simply Equal. Shortly after the Primary election, Doug Compton announced that he would oppose the amendment and planned to ask Commission to vote on the issue before general election. At that time, three City Commissioners opposed Simply Equal and two supported it. However, after talking with the City Manager and other commissioners, Compton decided not to call for a vote on the amendment before the April 4 general. On the April 4 General election, Joh Nalbandian came in first. Allen Levine, who took sixth place in the Primary election, took third place, just 16 votes behind Bonnie Augustine, a Simply Equal opponent. Simply Equal passed on May 2, 1995 with a 3-2 vote. \\"The ordinance change sends a very powerful message to people that Lawrence won't tolerate discrimination based on sexual orientation,\\" Zimmerman said. \\"People who feel they have been discriminated against can now file complaints with the human relations office.\\"\\"'EQUAL' WINS ORDINANCE AMENDMENT\\" University Daily Kansan KU Lawrence, KS, April 26, 1995 Ray Samuel, director of Lawrence's Human Relations department, agreed that many of the opponents who spoke to the commission Tuesday where misinformed. Businesses or Landlords would not be required to ask people their sexual orientations on an application nor would businesses need to hire a certain number of homosexuals would be required, Samuel said. Religious organizations would not be required to hire homosexuals. \\"There are no special rights or privileges being granted to anyone,\\" he said. \\"The amendment provides a vehicle to protect all the citizens of Lawrence from unlawful discrimination. We want to make sure no one is denied the opportunity to make a living because of their sexual orientation, that is what this is all about.\\"\\"ORDINANCE PASSED, BUT EDUCATION TO CONTINUE\\" University Daily Kansan KU Lawrence, KS, April 27, 1995 Arguments for and against Simply Equal Prior to the vote, residents were invited to speak at a public hearing in support of or against Simply Equal. =Proponents= Lynne Green, co-chair of Simply Equal, said that since 1986 four separate task forces organized to study the problem of discrimination have unanimously recommended the addition of sexual orientation to the city's human relations ordinance. She told the commission that Simply Equal had rallied the support of over 1,000 Lawrence residents, 300 businesses and 65 churches and synagogues. Though all of the commissioners had previously taken stands on the issue, more than fifty people made their way to the front of the crowded meeting room to speak out for or against the amendment. Supporting the amendment were individuals from the community, as well as religious leaders and representatives of organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, and Amnesty International. many spoke out against the irrational rhetoric and misinformation they said were widely used by opponents of civil rights. They specifically attacked the claim that Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual people do not need legal protection against discrimination and that anti-discrimination ordinances that included sexual orientation are a granting of \\"special rights.\\" \\"Many people are excluded from the US Constitution,\\" said Maurice Bryan, director of Affirmative Action at the University of Kansas. \\"Our history of civil rights battles strives to reinclude these people.\\" Bryan said that there are only two side issues surrounding the proposed amendment: \\"Either we are comfortable with discrimination or we are not.\\" =Opponents= Many of them told the commission that even though they were against the amendment, they were not homophobes and did not support discrimination/against Gay, Lesbian or Bisexual people. Several voiced concerns about increase cost for investigation and litigation they claimed the new ordinance would incur. Eric Schmidt, a Lawrence resident, said the ordinance reeked of \\"heavy-handed government,\\" and that its passage would send the city \\"down a dark and slippery path.\\" Many opponents attempted to make religious or moral arguments against the ordinance saying that it would erode the city's moral fabric and that they didn't. want their children to be exposed to values they didn't agree with. The Reverend William Dulin told the commission that \\"unless we have the moral courage to stand against the evils that underlie (the amendment), this city is going to be up against something that (it) will not like.\\" References LGBT political advocacy groups in Kansas ","title":"Simply Equal"},{"id":"21222870","text":"Roƒçinj ( or ; ) is a village on the right bank of the Soƒça River in the Municipality of Kanal ob Soƒçi in the Littoral region of Slovenia.Kanal ob Soƒçi municipal site Church The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Andrew and belongs to the Diocese of Koper.

He was born at Sandown Nursing Home, Great Yarmouth, the eldest of the four sons of Edward Andrew Lees, who was a Great Yarmouth Borough Councillor and Hotelier and his wife Beryl Lees (n√©e Whiteley). He studied zoology, botany and philosophy at the University of Wales in Cardiff receiving an honours degree in 1971. He then spent a period working for the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC). In 2006 Lees was placed 43rd in the UK Environment Agency's all-time list of scientists, campaigners, writers, economists and naturalists who, in its view, have done the most to save the planet. Lees was positioned between murdered Brazilian environmentalist, Dionisio Ribeiro Filho and tropical ecologist Mike Hands.David Adam, Earthshakers: the top 100 green campaigners of all time The Guardian, 28 November 2006 Lowland fens of Swansea His campaigning as an environmentalist started in 1978. He started a campaign to stop tipping at Crymlyn Bog which straddles the county boundaries between Neath and Swansea being used as a landfill site. In 1981 working alongside Friends of the Earth, he obtained permission from the courts to proceed with a Judicial Review regarding the failure of the NCC to notify part of the bog as a protected Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The NCC conceded the case and the site was given protection. Crymlyn Bog achieved international protected status as a Ramsar Site in 1993. The northern limb of the bog, Pant-y-Sais Fen, was also protected as a result of his campaigning. It was already being filled with rubbish but working with local residents he persuaded the local council to compulsorily purchase the fen as nature reserve. This was the first, and only time a site has been purchased in this way to become a nature reserve. Norfolk Broads He left Wales in 1981 and returned to Norfolk. In 1982 he helped form Broadlands Friends of the Earth and became its Chairman. He lobbied government and campaigned in the media over threats facing the Halvergate Marshes. In 1986, after much campaigning large areas were designated an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA). Later after much public pressure The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads 1988 Act was passed. It created The Broads Authority as a Special Statutory Authority which has a special duty to \\"conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the Broads\\". Campaigner In 1985, Andrew Lees was appointed as Friends of the Earth (EWNI)'s campaigner for the countryside and pesticides and became the pollution and toxics campaigner in 1986. In 1990 Andrew became Friends of the Earth's National Campaigns Director.

After an extensive search his body was found in a small clearing on 7 January. His disappearance as a prominent British environmentalist had created much media interest in the UK and there was speculation of foul play. However his camera equipment was discovered intact with his body and an autopsy showed that he died of heat exhaustion.

She is most known for her industrial enterprises, and she has been referred to as the first female grand entrepreneur of her country. She served as √∂verhovm√§starinna to Queen Christina of Sweden. Biography =Early life= Maria Sofia De la Gardie was born to count Jacob De la Gardie and Ebba Brahe. She was the sister of Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, the favorite of Queen Christina, Queen of Sweden and the sister-in-law of Princess Countess Palatine Maria Eufrosyne of Zweibr√ºcken, the cousin of the queen. She was born and raised in Swedish Estonia, where her father was governor of Reval. In 1643, she married baron Gustaf Gabrielsson Oxenstierna (1613‚Äì1648), nephew of regent Axel Oxenstierna (1583‚Äì1654) who succeeded her father as governor of Estonia. As was the custom in 17th century Swedish nobility, she kept her own name also after marriage. Both her own family and the family of her spouse was extremely wealthy. During his absence, she managed his estates. =Life at court= After the death of her spouse in 1648, she became the guardian of her two underage daughters and responsible of the vast estates of the family. After the death of her father in 1652, she was given the responsibility of several estates also after him, making her one of the greater landowners in Sweden. Maria Sofia was described as a great beauty, temperamental, forceful and talented, and could speak both French and German fluently. She was close to her brother Magnus Gabriel, the favorite of the monarch, and it was possibly because of him that she was showered with gifts from the monarch. She was given an allowance which helped her sort out her affairs, and her late spouse was posthumously granted the title of count, giving her the title and rank of precedence of countess at court. In 1651, she was appointed head lady-in-waiting, first with the title Court Mistress (Hovmastarinna) but soon with the title Chief Court Mistress (Overhovmastarinna), the highest office for a female at the royal court, though it was split on several people during the reign of Christina. She often hosted the queen at her residence Tyres√∂ Palace, were the monarch liked to hunt. In 1649, there was reports of a possible marriage with the heir to the throne, future King Charles X of Sweden. The Danish ambassador reported about them in November that year. The plans was never realized, but the rumors continued until 1652. They were possibly staged by Queen Christina of Sweden as a way of avoiding the pressure of Christina to marry Charles. In reality, they are not considered to have been serious if they did occur. It is however known that she was proposed to by the Duke of Croy. Maria Sofia had many suitors but preferred to stay unmarried. It is known that she passionately supported her brother when he fell from grace in 1653, but this does not seem to have affected neither his nor her own position. With some exceptions, such as Ebba Sparre, lady Jane Ruthven and Louise van der Nooth, Christina did not show any interest in her female courtiers, and generally mentions them only to express contempt over their femininity and portray herself as more masculine than them. After the abdication of Christina in 1654, Maria Sofia left court to devote her life to her industrial interests, for which she has become known in history. =Industrial activity= Maria Sofia De la Gardie resided in Tyres√∂ Palace, from where she managed her estates around the Baltic Sea. On her brothers suggestion she made a study trip to the Netherlands, to study the industrial life. She was interested in cattlebreeding and gardening. She managed glovemaking and a brassmakery. Her most successful enterprise was a textile industry: by the energy of waterfalls on her estate, she manufactured the broadcloth and textiles which equipped to the army. During the 1650s, De la Gardie engaged in banking activity and competed with her competitor, Stockholms Banco, by taking up large loans in the bank and then using the sums by lending it to the customers in her own bank: this was initially very lucrative, but eventually, problems enabled the Stockholms Banco to confiscate and sell her banking security.Du Rietz, Anita, Kvinnors entrepren√∂rskap: under 400 √•r, 1. uppl., Dialogos, Stockholm, 2013 Maria Sofia De la Gardie took part in the pacification of Sk√•ne by acquiring several estates there after it had been incorporated into Sweden in 1658. In 1667, she bought Krapperup Castle and managed a colliery for export. She built ships, exported timber and grain, founded papermills and fabricated linseed oil. During the famous Katarina witch trial in Stockholm in 1676, the main witness Lisbeth Carlsdotter, inspired by the G√§vle-Boy, tried to implicate her and her sister-in-law Maria Eufrosyne for witchcraft. This accusation was not taken seriously and never brought to trial, but rather, it damaged the credibility of the witness to such a point which eventually led to the end of the whole witch hunt. At the Great Reduction of King Charles XI of Sweden in the 1680s, most of her and her brothers property was confiscated by the crown, something which affected her deeply. She died in 1694.

In 1815, he removed to Whitesboro, and in 1817 took part in the construction of a section of the Erie Canal. From 1824 to 1829, he was engaged in the construction of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. On returning to Whitesboro he became agent of the Oriskany Manufacturing Company, and in 1832 assumed charge of the Dexter Company. He was also largely interested in manufactures elsewhere in the State of New York and in Elgin, Illinois. In 1840, he was elected by the New York State Legislature one of the canal commissioners, and remained in office until 1842 when the new Democratic majority removed the Whig commissioners. He was a trustee of Hamilton College, and for several years supported a professorship, giving the College in all about $32,000.

Cornish surnames and personal names remain common, and are often distinct from Irish, Scottish and Welsh names, although there is a similarity to Welsh and Breton names in many instances. Similarly, the majority of place names in Cornwall are still Brittonic. The Cornish language had died out as a primary spoken language by the end of the 18th century, but a revival of the tongue has been ongoing since the early 20th century. Cornish ancestry is not recognized on the United States Census. There are estimated to be close to 2 million people of Cornish descent in the U.S which is close to four times the present population of Cornwall in the United Kingdom which stands at approximately 550,000, although people of Cornish ancestry also live in other parts of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland thus the population of Cornwall should not be conflated with the total Cornish population of the United Kingdom. Cornish emigration to the United States Tangier Island is an island in lower Chesapeake Bay in Virginia: some inhabitants have a West Country accent that traces back to the settlers (including the Cornish) who arrived there in the 1600s. The coincidence of the decline of the mining industry in Cornwall in the 19th century and the discovery of large amounts of mineral deposits abroad meant that Cornish families headed overseas for work. Each decade between 1861 and 1901, a fifth of the entire Cornish male population migrated abroad ‚Äì three times the average for England and Wales. In total, the county lost over a quarter of a million people between 1841 and 1901. Large numbers of Cornish people moved to the United States, and while some stayed in New York City and other East Coast ports after arriving, many moved inland to mining areas in California, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. One such area was Mineral Point, Wisconsin, in which the largest group of immigrants were Cornish miners attracted to the lead mining opportunities, and by 1845 roughly half of the town's population had Cornish ancestry. Today the Cornish town of Redruth is twinned with Mineral Point. Cornish culture in the United States A \\"Cousin Jack's\\" pasty shop in Grass Valley, California Mineral Point, Wisconsin serves Cornish food, such as pasties and figgyhobbin, and Cornish pasties are sold at ex-Cornish mining towns in America, especially in Butte, Montana and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In California, statues and monuments in many towns pay tribute to the influence of the Cornish on their development. In the city of Grass Valley, the tradition of singing Cornish carols lives on and one local historian of the area says the songs have become \\"the identity of the town\\". Some of the members of today's Cornish Carol Choir are in fact descendants of the original Cornish gold miners. The city holds St Piran's Day celebrations every year, which along with carol singing, includes a flag raising ceremony, games involving the Cornish pasty, and Cornish wrestling competitions. The city is twinned with Bodmin in Cornwall. Cornish culture continues to have an influence in the Copper Country of northern Michigan, the Iron Ranges of northern Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, and Butte, Montana. Cornish immigrant miners are depicted in the TV series Deadwood, speaking their native language, even though Cornish had died out in the 18th century before a revival in the 20th century; the actors in the relevant scenes are, in fact, speaking Irish, a fellow Celtic language, but not mutually intelligible as Irish/Gaelic is from a different branch of the Celtic languages, whereas Cornish being much closer to, and a part of the same branch, as the still thriving Welsh and Breton, and the now extinct Brittonic languages of Great Britain such as Cumbric and Pictish. Legends of the Fall, a novella by American author Jim Harrison, detailing the lives of a Cornish American family in the early 20th century, contains several Cornish language terms. These were also included in the Academy Award-winning film of the same name starring Anthony Hopkins as Col. William Ludlow and Brad Pitt as Tristan Ludlow. The fictional character Conan the Barbarian is not depicted as Cornish, however the name Conan is a Brittonic Cornish name.

DSTO is a tri-service organisation and trains personnel of the British armed forces in survival techniques, evading capture and resistance from interrogation, prior to overseas deployment.  History  = Background = The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force have what has been described as a \\"rich history of survival training\\". Crews were often lost at sea during the Second World War, with an attrition rate of 80%, which prompted this training to be initiated. Prior to the DSTO being established, each of the UK's armed forces carried out their own SERE training. The RAF and Royal Navy each provided their own defence, survive, evade and extract training whereas the Resistance Training Wing trained provided all services with resistance training.  Royal Air Force  The Royal Air Force can trace such training back to May 1943 with the formation of the School of Air/Sea Rescue, located near RAF Squire Gate in Lancashire. The school taught RAF and USAAF crews rescue procedures and familiarisation with rescue equipment. It relocated to RAF Calshot in Hampshire in 1945, when it became the Survival and Rescue Training Unit, before moving to RAF Thorney Island in West Sussex during 1946. It disbanded in April 1949, but was replaced by the Survival and Rescue Mobile Instruction Unit (SRMIU), again at Thorney Island, in January 1950. The SRMIU would provide training to personnel during annual visits to RAF stations, however this method was considered inadequate and in 1955 the Search, Rescue and Survival School was established as part of No. 2 Air Navigation School. The School moved to RAF Mount Batten near Plymouth In June 1959. At that time it was renamed the School of Combat Survival and Rescue (SCSR), reflecting the combat environment which it was expected that survival and rescue skills would typically be used. RAF Mount Batten closed in 1992, with the school relocated to RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall, where it remained until 2008.  Royal Navy  Before 1943, Royal Navy survival training and equipment was the responsibility of two ratings trained by the RAF. The significance of the work however resulted in a reorganisation whereby the navy would train its own Survival Equipment Officers and ratings. The new Royal Navy Survival Equipment School (RNSES) initially took up residence at Eastleigh in Hampshire before moving to improved accommodation at Grange Airfield (HMS Siskin) in March 1947. In 1955, the school moved to a former boy‚Äôs preparatory school (Seafield Park) at Hill Head. It remained at Hill Head until September 1991 when it relocated to the former Naval Aircraft Technical Evaluation Centre (NATEC) building at RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus). In February 1995, the RNSES become part of the Royal Navy Air Engineering School which was renamed Royal Navy Air Engineering and Survival School (RNAESS). When Lee-on-Solent closed in March 1996, the RNAESS was relocated to a purpose built building at HMS Sultan in Gosport. The unit was renamed the Survival Equipment Group and formed part of the Air Engineering and Survival Department, remaining at HMS Sultan until 2008.  Resistance Training Wing  Formerly 4 Conduct after Capture Company (4 CAC Coy), the Resistance Training Wing (RTW) was part of the now disbanded Joint Services Intelligence Organisation (JSIO) based at Defence Intelligence Security Centre Chicksands in Bedfordshire. The wing trained personnel resistance to interrogation techniques. = Establishment = The Defence Survive, Evade, Resist, Extract (SERE) Training Organisation (DSTO) was created in 2008, when the RAF's School of Combat Survival and Rescue was amalgamated with the Royal Navy's Survival Equipment Group and the Resistance Training Wing. Although DSTO is a tri-service organisation, it comes under the control of No. 22 Group within RAF Air Command. Previous to this, training was undertaken at three different sites across the three services at diverse locations such as Chicksands and at HMS Sultan. The Royal Air Force is the lead on aircrew- focused training for military personnel in the United Kingdom and their second training centre (ASTC) is located at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. The patron of ASTC is Ray Mears, who himself was in a SERE situation whilst filming in 2005 when his helicopter crashed in Wyoming. Mears managed to recover all of his crew to safety after the incident.  Role and operations  Military personnel practising survival and rescue skills. SERE is an acronym for Survive, Evade, Resist and Extract. At a basic level, this is a core aspect of training for all UK military personnel on an annual basis. Regular Army personnel are tested as part of their Military Annual Training Tests (MATTs)Defence Information Notice 2008DIN07-109 as befits their frontline nature (similar processes are run by the Royal Marines and RAF Regiment) with non-frontline personnel mandated to watch a DVD detailing SERE methods. UK armed forces personnel who train at the SERE school, may be subject to methods of interrogation that are prohibited under international law. This training is carried out under strictly controlled conditions and is only delivered to enable the trainees to understand the methods that may be used against them if they are captured by hostile forces who are not signatories to, or adherents of, the Geneva Convention or of international law. SERE is mandated for all aircrew (from across all three services) and involves sea drills for those that require it. Sea drill involves jumping into the sea and spending some time adrift before hauling oneself into a dinghy from where the servicemember can be rescued. The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force aircrews practice this with regularity. Television personality Carol Vorderman undertook sea drills SERE training at RAF St Mawgan as part of her effort to become the ninth female to fly solo around the world. SERE training is also delivered to aircrew because the nature of their job makes them vulnerable to capture if they have to bail out over or crash an aircraft into hostile territory.

Biography Johnson was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Several of his brothers had careers in music, among them the soul musician Syl Johnson and the bassist Mack Thompson, who played with Magic Sam. In his younger years he played piano and sang in gospel groups. He and his family moved to Chicago in 1950, where he worked as a welder and played guitar in his spare time. He began playing professionally with Slim Willis in 1959, changing his last name to Johnson, as did his brother Syl. As a guitarist he was influenced by Buddy Guy and Otis Rush. He played with Freddy King, Albert King, Magic Sam, Otis Rush, and Eddy Clearwater, among others.Dahl, Bill. [ Jimmy Johnson: Biography]. Allmusic.com. In the 1960s he played music in more of an R&B; style, working with Otis Clay, Denise LaSalle, and Garland Green. He had his own group from the early 1960s, and by the mid-1960s he had released his first single. By 1974, Johnson had returned to playing blues, working with Jimmy Dawkins and touring Japan with Otis Rush in 1975. His first solo albums appeared on MCM Records in 1978 and Delmark Records in 1979, when he was fifty years old. Reviewing the 1979 Johnson's Whacks, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): \\"Syl's cousin performed better on Alligator's Living Chicago Blues Volume I, but only marginally, and he compensates by showing unexpected chops as a writer. Whether hoping to make the cover of Living Blues magazine or complaining that women aren't loyal any more, he comes across as a bold-faced contemporary. But his basic wail starts to sound thin after a while, his band is only solid, and his guitar can't carry the extra load.\\" In November 1980, Johnson was awarded at the first annual Blues Music Awards, held in Memphis. His career continued to pick up until December 2, 1988, when his touring van crashed in Indiana, killing his band's keyboardist, St. James Bryant, and bassist, Larry Exum. Johnson was injured and took an extended break from the music industry. He returned to record for Verve Records in 1994. In 2002, he recorded with his brother Syl. He remained active and toured Europe in 2009, performing in the United Kingdom and at the Copenhagen Blues Festival in Denmark. On Friday June 7, 2019, while performing at the 36th annual Chicago Blues Fest, Chicago Major Laurie Lightfoot officially declared it to be Jimmy Johnson Day.

It was established in 1995 by the Nordic Council of Ministers and closed down in 2011. The Institute aimed at constituting a bridge between Nordic gender research and equality politics. It co-operated closely with the Nordic Ministers for Co-operation on Gender Equality and the Nordic Executive Committee on Gender Equality. It claimed to contribute to the implementation of the Nordic cooperation programme on gender equality: \\"Focus on Gender: Working toward an Equal Society\\" (2006-2010). It initiated projects with the goal of gender equality, and coordinated and carried out investigations, studies, surveys, reports and opinions. The Institute was located at the University of Oslo in Norway. It employed research coordinators, researchers, information advisors, and administrative personnel - in 2010 the staff consisted of six employees from four of the Nordic countries.  Reorganizing  In 2011, the Nordic Council of Ministers decided to reorganize NIKK, from a Nordic institute to a Nordic co-operation programme. A bidding round was announced in 2012. The co- operation programme was to further develop the information function, administer a Nordic funding scheme for gender equality and serve as project secretariat. The University of Gothenburg and the Swedish Secretariat for Gender Research won the bidding. Nordic Information on Gender, NIKK, was established in late 2012 and the programme's assignment expires at the end of 2015. As the acronym NIKK is established in the Nordic region and beyond, and associated with information, research and knowledge related to gender and gender equality, the Nordic co-operation programme continues to use NIKK. = Impact of Hjernevask = Kjersti Nipen have speculated about the decision to restructure NIKK, and its relation to the public debate that followed the seven-part television documentary series Hjernevask ('Brainwash'), by the comedian and documentarian Harald Eia, which aired in spring 2010 on the Norwegian broadcasting service NRK. However, the Norwegian Research Council has denied that the programme had any influence on its decision not to renew the Norwegian research programme on gender in 2011. The gender researcher Marit Aure speculates, however, that the discussions on gender research, following the programme, might have influenced the decision indirectly, by presenting gender research in Norway as a more established field than actually was the case. Anders Hanneborg, involved in the Norwegian Research Council's committee that evaluated the Norwegian gender research programme's renewal application, explained that the programme was not renewed in order to decentralize and strengthen gender research in Norway. He also denied directly that the television programme Hjernevask was any part of their discussions on the issue. The Norwegian research programme on gender had received funding in 2008 for a period of four years, which expired in 2011. The Norwegian research programme, funded by the Norwegian Research Council, was not related to NIKK, which was funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers. The Norwegian Parliament, responding to a direct question from Tord Lien of the rightist Progress Party, addressed these television programmes. The core of his criticism concerned the scientific neglect of the biological to the social component. The Minister of Research and Higher Education, Tora Aasland, from the Socialist Left Party, dismissed these criticisms, adding that multidisciplinary gender research in Norway has been evaluated positively, not by television programmes, but through external scientific evaluations of Norwegian research on the field. The Norwegian network for Gender Studies states correlations between Hjernevask and increased discussion on the gender studies in its Annual report 2010.  Projects  The Nordic Gender Institute initiated, co-ordinated, and executed projects that focus on central gender equality issues, i.e. research and development, statements, surveys, and reports. The most recent projects are: * Gender and Power in the Nordic Countries (2008-2009) * Gendered Citizenship in Multicultural Europe: The Impact of Contemporary Women's Movements (FEMCIT) (2007-2011) * Prostitution in the Nordic Countries (2007-2008) * Multidimensional Discrimination Policies in the Nordic Countries (2007) * Gender Equality and Quality of Life. A Norwegian Perspective (2007) * Youth, Gender and Pornography in the Nordic Countries (2004-2006) A large NIKK study on prostitution for the Nordic ministers of gender equality was presented in October 2008. The study on gender and power was presented in November 2009.  Magazine  NIKK magasin wrote about new and current themes and perspectives on gender research and gender equality politics in the Nordic countries. It was published three times a year: two issues in Scandinavian languages - one issue in English.

In December 2018, he defended the interests of Saif ul Malook, Asia Bibi's lawyer, a Pakistani Christian sentenced to death for blasphemy and acquitted at the end of October after having spent nine years in prison. In February 2019 he launched an appeal to the European heads of state to ask them to give Saif ul Malook \\"the protection and the status that his heroism calls\\". With the support of Lawyers Without Borders, SOS Eastern Christians and Bars, he calls on European leaders to allow Saif Al Malook to reside and work freely in Europe. In 2019, he became one of the two French lawyers of Carlos Ghosn during his incarceration in Japan. At the request of the family, Fran√ßois Zimeray seized the UN to denounce a detention that he considers as \\"medieval\\".

He has been the first non-career diplomat to hold this position since its creation in 2000 and has also had the longest assignment so far. Zimeray has worked with four different Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Secretary of State: Bernard Kouchner, Mich√®le Alliot-Marie, Alain Jupp√© and Rama Yade. He was chosen to present France‚Äôs Universal Periodic Review (UPR) at the Human Rights Council in 2008 and 2012, as well as to represent France to the Alliance of Civilizations and Durban II Conference. Since then, near to 100 diplomatic missions have led him to the Syrian border, Chechnya, Colombia, Gaza, Israel, Sri Lanka camps, Turkmenistan, Burma, Moscow, Thailand, Baghdad, Jordan, Lebanon, Kirghizstan, Uganda, Chad, Burundi, Congo, Rwanda, Libya, Algeria, Egypt, Nepal, among others. In October 2011, he went to Tripoli just a few days after the death of former leader Muammar Gaddafi. In November 2011, he was one of the first diplomats to be received in Rangoon by the Lady Aung San Suu Kyi, one month before the official visit of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In January and April 2012, Fran√ßois Zimeray went twice to Kharkov prison, attempting to visit former Prime Minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko. Although he was not allowed to enter the prison and see her, he attended the opening session of her second trial and denounced \\"accusations obviously politically grounded\\". Zimeray represented the French diplomacy by attending several trials. He went to Moscow for Mikhail Khodorkovsky's trial, to Kazakhstan to support the human rights defender Yevgeny Zhovtis. In January 2011, he went to Yuriy Lutsenko's trial, in Kiev. In accordance with EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders, Fran√ßois Zimeray set the following goal: \\"Each French embassy has to become a 'House of Human rights'.\\" As Ambassador in charge of the Holocaust issues, Zimeray launched different initiatives to raise awareness about contemporary antisemitism: he went to Auschwitz several times and supports important projects enhancing dialogue between cultures, such as the Aladdin Project, which had been presented in Baghad in February 2010. =Human rights and peace activism= Zimeray's commitment to human rights dates back to 1979, when, then aged 17, he founded an association to support and cater for Cambodian refugees in Paris. Thereafter, he made visit to refugee camps on the Thai border, where he forged his political beliefs. Since then, his commitment for human rights has never ended. He played a decisive role in the organisation of the European campaign in support for Darfur. In 2007, he visited the Darfur refugee camps in Chad with the French philosopher, Bernard-Henri L√©vy. He raised awareness and managed to mobilize French public opinion as well as political leaders. In May 2009, Zimeray founded the Alliance of Lawyers for Human rights, based in Paris offering free legal expertise to associations, NGOs and institutions working in the field of human rights. Zimeray is also a prominent figure well known for his committed support for the Palestinian moderates and the Israeli \\"peace camp\\" in 2002. He actively supports The People's Voice, the initiative by Palestinian Sari Nusseibeh and Israeli Ami Ayalon. Fran√ßois Zimeray went to Gaza twice and described the attitude of people defining themselves as exclusively in favour of one side against the other (\\"pro-palestinian\\" or \\"pro-Israel\\") as \\"intellectual hooliganism\\" (speech at the French National Assembly for \\"Kids creating Peace\\"). He founded the Cercle L√©on Blum and worked to promote dialogue between European leaders and Middle Eastern political and civil society representatives as Chairman of the Medbridge Strategy Center founded in Brussels with prominent European politicians such as Willy De Clercq, Fran√ßois L√©otard, Emma Bonino and Ana Palacio. He then had several meetings with Shimon Peres, Mahmoud Abbas and King Abdullah II of Jordan. =Lawyer= Zimeray is a member of the Paris Bar and the International Criminal Bar of The Hague. He has represented victims in trials of Khmer Rouge leaders, successfully campaigned to free imprisoned political opponents in Laos, and defended a child soldier in Congo/Kinshasa before the International Criminal Court. He has also defended cases before the European Court of Human Rights. During twenty years, Zimeray has worked as a lawyer in the firm Jeantet&Associ;√©s. Back then, he advised individuals as well as French and international companies. With his partners, Hubert V√©drine and Jean-Pierre Jouyet, he took part in the international development of the Jeantet firm. Zimeray is a member of the French Institute of International Legal Experts (IFEJI). He created with Jessica Finelle (September 2018) the lawyer firm Zimeray&Finelle; =Member of the European Parliament= At 37, Zimeray became the youngest member of the French socialist delegation at the European Parliament, elected on Francois Hollande's list. He worked in the Legal Affairs Committee and the Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy Committee. He is the author of eight reports adopted unanimously and took part in the framing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In 2001, at the request of Emma Bonino, former Humanitarian Aid Commissioner, Fran√ßois Zimeray went to Laos in order to defend and free a member of the European Parliament, as well as four other human rights defenders. Although member of the socialist group, he did not hesitate to defend the parliamentarian immunities of Charles Pasqua (PPE) and Daniel Cohn-Bendit (PVE), respectively in 2002 and 2003. But for the 2004 election, the socialist party choose another candidate to represent them, judging Zimeray too anti-Palestinian.Darfour : le r√©veil des consciences , Lib√©ration, 20 mars 2007. =Local official= Zimeray, identified by former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, first made his mark in 1989 when at just 27 years old he was elected Mayor of Petit-Quevilly (23,000 inhabitants). He became the youngest mayor of a town with over 20,000 inhabitants in France and founded the first association of mayors for environment, \\"Eco-Maires\\". He transformed the city by creating parks, accommodation, new areas and facilities such as the multimedia library Fran√ßois Truffaut. He was re-elected two times in the first round. In 2001, he was elected President of the Greater Rouen-Normandy area (37 cities, 450,000 inhabitants) and launched several urban and cultural projects: the Palais des Sports (designed by Dominique Perrault), the renovation of the docks and public transportations (metro, cycle). Views on human rights Zimeray has stated \\"We face a frequent misunderstanding. Many people place human rights in some kind of moral area and wait for us to answer with symbols, declarations and gestures.One must have the courage to say that Human Rights are not morality, they are rights that exist or does not exist, that are applied or violated: the right to not be tortured, access to fair trial, equality between men and women. Our action does not only take place in some declaratory and narcissistic style.\\" Zimeray has commented that he does not like the expression that France is \\"the country of human rights\\" and stated \\"I know the state of French prisons... I would rather say that France and Human Rights are like an old couple, and as with every couple there are ups and downs. In his book published after the Copenhagen terror attack he survived (February 14, 2015) he advocates against patriarchy : \\"But if, at the end of this journey, I had to choose just one cause that stands above all others, I now know that our determination to empower women to achieve their full potential ‚Äì particularly by educating girls ‚Äì will speak volumes about the future of humanity. It is a cause we can all subscribe to, and I know no higher one. (..) Around the world I have seen women challenge the patriarchal order that subjects them to violence and forces men to serve the empire of domination and performance.\\" The book, \\"J'ai vu partout le m√™me visage\\" (\\"I have seen the same face everywhere I went\\") - \\"An Ambassador comes face to face with man‚Äôs inhumanity to man\\" was granted the Pierre Simon Ethics and geopolitics prize in Paris City hall.

Life and death Cornelis Frederik Bezuidenhout, known by the nickname Freek, was the fifth of seven children of Wynand Jacobus Bezuidenhout, a burgher of Graaff-Reinet, and his wife, Maria Terblans, a descendant of Wynand Leendertsz Bezuidenhout, of the Netherlands, master gardener at the Cape, and his wife, Jannetje Gerrits, of Amsterdam. He was born in the Graaff-Reinet district and baptised on 9 June 1773. As a frontier farmer, he lived in seclusion in the valley of the Baviaans River, east of Cradock. He was said to know no fear, to be full of self-confidence and decidedly arrogant and quick-tempered. As a result of his views on public affairs he came into conflict with the authorities. Unrest on the eastern frontier, caused by conflicts with the Xhosa, increased the tension, especially after the Black Circuit in 1812. Bezuidenhout was generally known as a difficult man; he was accused by his servant, Booi, of ill-treatment and of holding back his pay due to a theft accusation against Booi. He was summoned to appear before the court at Graaff-Reinet. At first he sent poor excuses for his absence, but eventually defied the court's orders. As a result, he was sentenced in his absence by a circuit court for contempt of court to a month's imprisonment. An order for his arrest was issued and landdrost Andries Stockenstr√∂m of Graaff-Reinet instructed the Deputy- Messenger of the Court to carry out the order. Receiving no help from the Field Cornet of the ward, he proceeded to the nearest military post, commanded by Captain Andrews, armed with a letter asking for military assistance. While Bezuidenhout was preparing to resist his arrest by force, Lieutenant F Rousseau accompanied the Deputy-Messenger with a patrol of twelve Khoikhoi soldiers. He was confronted at the Baviaans River (the present Glen Lynden) on 16 October 1815. Bezuidenhout refused to surrender and fired on the soldiers. With his half-breed son and a casual visitor, Jacob Erasmus, he sought refuge amongst the tumbled rocks of the nearby valley. He would not listen to reason and recommenced firing until he was mortally wounded by the soldiers returning the fire. His son and Erasmus, who took no part in the action, surrendered. Bezuidenhout was buried on the farm the next day by his relatives. There is no certainty about Bezuidenhout's wife or children, apart from one son, Gerrit Coenraad Bezuidenhout (1790-1838). Memorial The cave in which Bezuidenhout died, and also his grave, are at Silverbrook farm, the present Glen Lynden in the Eastern Cape. The Dutch Reformed Church and the local Reddingsdaadbond erected an obelisk of red dolerite at the cave and a granite rock at the grave. These two memorials are about 200 yards apart on the road between Bedford and Tarkastad in the Eastern Cape province. Aftermath At Bezuidenhout's funeral, his brother, Johannes Jurgen (Hans Jan) Bezuidenhout, swore to avenge himself on the officials whom he held responsible for his brother's death. He incited the whole community to resistance against British authority. He believed that his decision to chase the British and the Khoikhoi into the sea and to establish an independent state on the eastern frontier coincided with the wishes of all the burghers. About sixty burghers took an oath of vengeance and loyalty and took part in what became known as the Slachter's Nek Rebellion. The Slachter's Nek Rebellion was an uprising by Boers in 1815 on the eastern border of the Cape Colony. The rebellion, which was small and local, was handled so badly that it acquired importance as an incident in the struggle of Afrikanerdom against British domination.

Dump digging is the practice of locating and excavating old garbage dumps with the intent of discovering objects which have potential value as collectibles or antiques. These dumps are sometimes centuries old, but often date to the late 19th century or early part of the 20th century. Among other things, the practice of dump digging is directly linked to antique bottle collecting and glassmaking. It is a form of historical digging which involves long hours working with a shovel, pick and other hand tools. Finding evidence of potential antique bottle dumps or middens is done by searching areas where it is likely that older garbage was deposited. Diggers generally look for clues of pre-1920s junk piles in the woods or down embankments, places where old houses or businesses stand or once stood. Hiking along waterways and swampy areas, particularly during droughts, can also produce important clues and lead to good discoveries. Additionally, many coastal cities are surrounded by landfills or ‚Äútips‚Äù, places where enormous quantities of trash were deposited in the past intended to create additional acres of viable real estate. It can take many months of searching each of these locations for a decent dig to be surface. Background and controversies Dump digging for potentially valuable collectibles is at least as old as the Pharaohs. For practical reasons dump diggers often use a much less forensic style than academic archeologists or museum curators would on their projects. Not unlike the privies, cisterns and wells that other historical diggers explore and salvage in, dumps are typically fleeting sources. They are often located on properties which are in the process of being permanently altered by major development and other factors. Items found and locations A clay pipe discovered while excavating an old bottle dump (ca. 1870). Dump digging can yield different items and artifacts in each location. A town dump can be somewhat different than a farm dump or a railroad dump but in each case there could be industrial age pottery, stoneware, china, tobacco pipes, military relics like bayonets and gun barrels, musket balls, uniform buttons and other buttons, marbles and an assortment of other things. A high percentage of these dump discoveries are routinely found in severe states of decay, damaged or broken altogether. In many cases, even the things which have stood the test of time remarkably well have little if any monetary value. There are many exceptions to this general rule that keep dump diggers busy searching and occasionally they are surprised by what they unearth working their sites. Through the common process known as tipping, vast amounts of refuse generated by towns and cities were dumped into harbors, along marshy shorelines and other areas while forming viable real estate cheaply. Excavating in these areas is also a form of dump digging. Elusive and often deep, small portions of these ashy landfill dumps are sometimes rediscovered during major development projects. Enormous quantities of a given location's everyday trash were deposited into these often difficult to reach locales. The bulk of this garbage has never been investigated and at present much of it is still undiscovered. Through researching and active searching occasionally the opportunity arises to dig into small portions and find old bottles and other objects which survive remarkably well as curiosities, collectibles or antiques. For centuries active waterways were also frequently converted into major dumping spots for household and industrial refuse but they are generally impossible to reach without expensive equipment. Along with the existing information generated from the efforts of dump diggers and others, a wealth of additional information is waiting among these widely distributed landfills and other dumping spots.

Life He got to know the physicist Alexandre Charles and, in the wake of the experiences of the Montgolfier brothers, Coutelle and Charles became interested in balloons. On 2 April 1794 the National Convention made Coutelle a captain and first officer of the Company of Aeronauts and ordered him to build balloons to aid the French Revolutionary armies. In this role Coutelle was attached to the French invasion of Egypt of 1798 under Napoleon Bonaparte, but he was unable to function in this role in Egypt since the warship carrying his materials was severely damaged by fire during the Battle of the Nile. Holmes, Richard, Falling Upwards, London: Collins, 2013, p. 34 Instead he became one of the scholars of the Commission des Sciences et des Arts. In November 1800 Coutelle and the mining engineer Rozi√®re were authorised to accompany the great caravan of Tor, which was heading to Sinai with 1,800 camels. A member of the Costaz commission, he began to admire the two obelisks at Luxor and suggested to the Institut d'√âgypte a new way of transporting one of them to France - 30 years later, a similar method to his suggestion was used to transport one to the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where it now stands.

Biography =Early life= Perkins was born in Melbourne, the son of Daryl Perkins. As a youngster, Perkins played cricket, football and basketball. He played basketball at a very high level aged 7 to 14, but did not enjoy it enough to continue. Perkins rode BMX for a short while and began cycling aged in 1999 with his father, who had himself been a successful cyclist. His first cycling club was the Carnegie Caulfield Cycling Club, and his first medal was won at the Victoria state championships at Northcote, it was a gold medal in the sprint event, where he beat friend and rival Michael Ford. Within three months of taking up cycling, he had qualified to compete at the U15 Australian National Championships in Sydney, there he won two gold medals and broke two Australian records in the process. He went on to win 11 further National Championship titles between then and 2006, and broke another two Australian records. He is an Australian Institute of Sport and Victorian Institute of Sport scholarship holder. =2004: Junior World championships= In Los Angeles in 2004, Perkins became the sprint and keirin junior World Champion. He tested positive for methamphetamine following the Keirin final on 29 July, his case was heard in front of the Court of Arbitration for Sport in November 2004. The Court took into account extenuating circumstances, accepting that Perkins had used a stimulant inadvertently. A Cycling Australia statement said: \\"In America Perkins purchased a nasal inhaler of the same brand he regularly uses in Australia without realising it contained a different active ingredient, namely methamphetamine, which is on the banned list,\\" Perkins' suspension ran for six months, from 16 November 2004. =Commonwealth Games= Perkins was reselected to represent Australia at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in his hometown, Melbourne. He won a bronze medal as part of Australia's team sprint squad, becoming the youngest ever Australian cyclist to win a Commonwealth Games medal. He then went on to represent his country and claim the gold medal in the Men's individual sprint event at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. His 2010 Commonwealth Games were not completely successful, however, as he was disqualified from the semifinal of the men's keirin. Relegated to the 7-12 place race, he swore at the judges as he crossed the finishing line. He later apologised and withdrew from the men's team sprint. At the 2014 Commonwealth Games, he was part of the team that won the bronze medal in the men's team sprint. =London 2012= Perkins qualified for the 2012 London Summer Olympics. Perkins competed in the Men's Sprint, Men's Keirin, and Men's Team Sprint. He was part of the Australian sprint team that finished 4th, finished 5th in the keirin but won the bronze medal in the individual sprint. =Since 2015: Out of Australian team and acquirement of the Russian citizenship, first European medal= Since 2015, Perkins was not considered to be a candidate to the Australian international team, in particular, he missed the 2016 Summer Olympics. On 15 February 2017, it was announced that Perkins is in the process of acquiring Russian citizenship with the goal to race for the Russian team at the 2020 Summer Olympics. In August 2017, Perkins was granted Russian citizenship. At the national championships, Perkins won gold with the Moscow team. He then won bronze in the individual sprint event, losing in the semifinals to eventual champion Pavel Yakushevskiy. He beat Alexey Tkachev in the bronze medal match. Perkins later also won gold in the keirin discipline. Perkins debuted at the European Championships in Berlin, Germany. He participated in the team sprint and keirin event. His team consisting of Pavel Yakushevskiy and Denis Dmitriev took the fourth place after losing the bronze medal race to the Dutch. In the keirin event, Perkins won his first European silver medal, losing only to the German Maximilian Levy. Personal life In February 2008, tension was brewing between Perkins and his rival for Olympic selection, Ryan Bayley. Both were deemed by the judges to be riding improperly at the Australian National Track Championships. Bayley crashed when Perkins moved down on him during a race, burning a hole in the back of his skinsuit. The relationship between the two riders was given another dimension, when Perkins announced his engagement to Bayley's younger sister, Kristine Bayley. Perkins and Kristine Bayley had a son, Aidan, in October 2008. They were married in November 2009. During 2018 Six Days of Berlin, his father Daryl Perkins who flew to watch him race was infected with Meningococcal meningitis, which could cause permanent disabilities or even death. A GoFundMe fundraising campaign organized by Six Day Series exceeded target of 20,000 euros under support of German public. His father got cured for 6 weeks and returned to Australia for further recovery. He was grateful of the reception and decided to race again in 2019 Six Days of Berlin.

TDE offers encryption at file level. TDE solves the problem of protecting data at rest, encrypting databases both on the hard drive and consequently on backup media. It does not protect data in transit nor data in use. Enterprises typically employ TDE to solve compliance issues such as PCI DSS which require the protection of data at rest. Microsoft offers TDE as part of its Microsoft SQL Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2019. TDE was only supported on the Evaluation, Developer, Enterprise and Datacenter editions of Microsoft SQL Server, until it was also made available in the Standard edition for 2019 \\"SQL Server 2019 Standard Edition\\"Microsoft Tech Community. SQL TDE is supported by hardware security modules from Thales e-Security, Townsend Security and SafeNet, Inc.

Oracle requires the Oracle Advanced Security option for Oracle 10g and 11g to enable TDE. Oracle TDE addresses encryption requirements associated with public and private privacy and security mandates such as PCI and California SB 1386. Oracle Advanced Security TDE column encryption was introduced in Oracle Database 10g Release 2. Oracle Advanced Security TDE tablespace encryption and support for hardware security modules (HSMs) were introduced with Oracle Database 11gR1. Keys for TDE can be stored in an HSM to manage keys across servers, protect keys with hardware, and introduce a separation of duties. The same key is used to encrypt columns in a table, regardless of the number of columns to be encrypted. These encryption keys are encrypted using the database server master key and are stored in a dictionary table in the database.  Microsoft SQL Server TDE  SQL Server utilizes an encryption hierarchy that enables databases to be shared within a cluster or migrated to other instances without re-encrypting them. The hierarchy consists of a combination of symmetric and asymmetric ciphers:\\"Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)\\" Microsoft TechNet * Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) protects a single instance-wide Service Master Key (SMK). * The Service Master Key encrypts the Database Master Key (DMK). * The Database Master Key is used in conjunction with a certificate to encrypt the Database Encryption Key. * The Database Encryption Key is used to encrypt the underlying database files with either the AES or 3DES cipher. * The master database that contains various system level information, user accounts and management services is not encrypted. During database backups, compression occurs after encryption. Due to the fact that strongly encrypted data cannot be significantly compressed, backups of TDE encrypted databases require additional resources. To enable automatic booting, SQL Server stores the lowest level encryption keys in persistent storage (using the DPAPI store). This presents a potential security issue because the stored keys can be directly recovered from a live system or from backups and used to decrypt the databases.Simon McAuliffe, \\"The Anatomy and (In)Security of Microsoft SQL Server Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)\\", 19-Mar-2016  See also  * Disk encryption * Encryption * Hardware security module References External links * Alternative 3rd party solution for all SQL Server Editions * Another alternative 3rd party solution for all SQL Server Editions * Enterprise Security Features Supported by Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Editions * Security Features Supported by Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Editions * Understanding Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) (Microsoft) * Using Transparent Data Encryption in Oracle Database 11g * Oracle Transparent Data Encryption best practices * TDE column encryption and TDE tablespace encryption in Oracle Database 11gR1 * http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/network.102/b14268/asotrans.htm#BABDFHHH * P6R's PKCS#11 Provider and Oracle TDE * Disk encryption ","title":"Transparent data encryption"},{"id":"21223342","text":"Oliver Barth (born 6 October 1979 in Stuttgart) is a retired German footballer and coach.

It was first named by Frank Robin O‚ÄôKeefe in 2001 and the type species is Hauffiosaurus zanoni. In 2011, two additional species were assigned to this genus: H. longirostris and H. tomistomimus. Description Skull, jaws, and cervical vertebrae of H. zanoni Hauffiosaurus is known from the holotype and only specimen uncatalogued Hauff Museum, an almost complete and articulated skeleton, found from the Posidonien-Schiefer, dating to early Toarcian stage of the Early Jurassic. The holotype specimen preserved in a single block of the original matrix, exposed in ventral view. The body outline visible around the specimen is an artifact of preparation, not preservation; no remains of soft tissue were preserved. The skeleton was discovered during the early 19th Century, in beds of the famous Posidonien-Schiefer lagerst√§tte at Holzmaden, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, in southeastern Germany. However, it was not recognized as a valid taxon, and no thorough description of the fossil was made until 2001. Hauffiosaurus zanoni is a plesiosaur of medium size, measuring . The skull measures about along the midline. The holotype is an adult individual, but incomplete fusion of the pectoral and pelvic girdle indicate it is not an old adult. The specimen is displayed at the Urwelt- Museum Hauff, Holzmaden. The exact phylogenetic position of Hauffiosaurus within the Plesiosauria has yet to be resolved, though Vincent (2011) states that it may \\"reasonably be placed within the Pliosauroidea\\". Hauffiosaurus longirostris skeleton A second species, H. tomistomimus, was named by Roger B. J. Benson, Hilary F. Ketchum, Leslie F. No√® and Marcela G√≥mez-P√©rez in 2011. It is known from the holotype and only specimen, MMUM LL 8004, an almost complete, three-dimensionally preservedand and articulated skeleton, found from the Hildoceras bifrons Zone (181.2‚Äì180.7 Ma) of the Alum Shale Member, Whitby Mudstone Formation, dating to early Toarcian stage. This skeleton was discovered in Yorkshire, UK. The holotype H. tomistomimus is about long. Benson et al. 2011 reassigned Macroplata longirostris (originally Plesiosaurus longirostris) to Hauffiosaurus. The holotype and only specimen of H. longirostris, MCZ 1033, found from the Harpoceras serpentinum Zone (182.7‚Äì181.2 Ma) of the Jet Rock Member, Whitby Mudstone Formation, early Toarcian of Yorkshire, England. Few Early Jurassic plesiosaurians have the sort of long, thin snout present in Hauffiosaurus, a shape usually considered to indicate a diet of fish (ichthyophagy). The teeth are slender and elongated and possess fine longitudinal ridges. This sort of tooth, coupled with the long rostrum seen in this genus is effective in piercing soft prey. Phylogeny Smith & Dyke, 2008 were the first who found Hauffiosaurus to be basal pliosauroid. Benson, Ketchum, No√® and G√≥mez-P√©rez who assigned two additional species to this genus, confirmed the affinity of this taxon to Pliosauroidea using cladistic analysis which was based on Ketchum & Benson's (2010) analysis. Cladogram after Benson et al., 2011: With the description of Marmornectes in 2011, Ketchum & Benson suggested for the first time that many basal plesiosaurs and pliosauroids are members of Pliosauridae and Rhomaleosauridae. Both Rhomaleosauridae and Pliosauridae were found to be monophyletic, and the relations between Hauffiosaurus's species remained the same. The cladogram below follows Ketchum & Benson, 2011.

It contains a single species, E. arcuatus. Like other plesiosaurs, Eurycleidus probably lived on a diet of fish, using its sharp needle-like teeth to catch prey. Its shoulder bones were fairly large, indicating a powerful forward stroke for fast swimming. Phylogeny Most phylogenetic analyses find the type species of the genus, Eurycleidus arcuatus, to be a relatively basal rhomaleosaurid. A second species, E. megacephalus (Stutchbury, 1846 [originally Rhomaleosaurus megacephalus]), was reassigned to this genus by Smith (2007). However, most analyses find E. megacephalus to represent an unnamed genus, which is distinct from both Eurycleidus and Rhomaleosaurus. E. megacephalus was moved to its own genus Atychodracon by Adam Smith in 2015. The cladogram below shows E. arcuatus phylogenetic position among other plesiosaurs following Benson et al. (2012).

Description Eromangasaurus is known from the holotype QM F11050, a nearly complete but badly crushed skull and mandible. It was collected in Maxwelton, from the Toolebuc Formation of the Eromanga Basin, dating to the late Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous, about 103 million years ago. Sven Sachs mentioned some referred material from the same locality as the holotype, QM F12216-19, an anterior cervical vertebra and QM F12217&2, associated posterior cervical vertebrae. Etymology Eromangasaurus was first named by Benjamin P. Kear in 2005 and the type species is Eromangasaurus australis. Benjamin P. Kear originally named QM F11050 as Eromangasaurus carinognathus. However, earlier in 2005, Sven Sachs named a second species of Tuarangisaurus, Tuarangisaurus australis, on the basis of the same specimen and some referred material. This nominal has priority over E. carinognathus, and therefore the latter is a junior synonym of T. australis. Later studies of the holotype by Kear pointed out that this species is distinct enough from the type species of Tuarangisaurus to be placed in its own genus. Eromangasaurus was the only available name for the new combination Eromangasaurus australis. E. australis is widely accepted today as the correct name for QM F11050. The generic name is derived from Eromanga, in reference to the Eromanga Basin in which the holotype was found, and saurus, Greek for \\"lizard\\". The specific name is named after Australia, in which the holotype was found.

A geo-fence could be dynamically generated‚Äîas in a radius around a point location, or a geo-fence can be a predefined set of boundaries (such as school zones or neighborhood boundaries). The use of a geofence is called geofencing, and one example of usage involves a location-aware device of a location-based service (LBS) user entering or exiting a geo-fence. This activity could trigger an alert to the device's user as well as messaging to the geo-fence operator. This info, which could contain the location of the device, could be sent to a mobile telephone or an email account. Applications Geofencing, used with child location services, can notify parents if a child leaves a designated area. Geofencing used with locationized firearms can restrict those firearms to fire only in locations where their firing is permitted, thereby making them unable to be used elsewhere. Geofencing is critical to telematics. It allows users of the system to draw zones around places of work, customer's sites and secure areas. These geo-fences when crossed by an equipped vehicle or person can trigger a warning to the user or operator via SMS or email. In some companies, geofencing is used by the human resource department to monitor employees working in special locations especially those doing field works. Using a geofencing tool, an employee is allowed to log his or her attendance using a GPS-enabled device when within a designated perimeter. Other applications include sending an alert if a vehicle is stolen, and notifying rangers when wildlife stray into farmland. Geo-fence can be used for location based messaging for tourist safety and communication. Geofencing, in a security strategy model, provides security to wireless local area networks. This is done by using predefined borders (e.g., an office space with borders established by positioning technology attached to a specially programmed server). The office space becomes an authorized location for designated users and wireless mobile devices.Hamid Jahankhani, A G Hessami, Feng Hsu: Global security, safety, and sustainability : 5th international conference, ICGS3 2009, London, UK, September 1-2, 2009 : proceedings. In 2015, US Senator Charles Schumer proposed a law requiring drone manufacturers to build geofencing constraints into unmanned aerial vehicle navigation systems that would override the commands of the unsophisticated operator, preventing the device from flying into protected airspace. Applications of Geofencing extend to Advertising & Marketing. Geofencing solution providers allow marketers and advertisers to precisely choose the exact geo-location that their ads show up on. Geofencing uses different types of targeting to identify geo-location such as zip codes, street addresses, GPS coordinates using latitude and longitude, as well as IP targeting. Geofencing enables competitive marketing tactics for advertisers and marketers to grab the attention of in-market shoppers in their competitive store location, large scale events such as concerts, sports events, conferences, etc. in stadiums, convention centers, malls, outlets, parks, neighborhoods. For example, a local auto-dealership builds a virtual boundary within a few square miles from its dealership's location to target car buyers within the same neighborhood. This way they limit their ad spending on prospects who are more likely to purchase in order to get a better ROI. Using tracking technologies to identify devices where the ads were shown, geofencing solution providers are able to provide walk-in attribution for their advertising. This means that using a geofencing solution, companies can now track the customers who walked into the showroom after seeing the ad. This level of attribution provides better visibility and analytics for marketers to spend their advertising budget wisely. A local service business may only be interested in (a) likely clients (b) within a service region or catchment basin. Broadcasting or advertising more extensively brings irrelevant responses and wastes energy, time, money, and opportunity. Electronic advertising can identify and target only desired market objects.
