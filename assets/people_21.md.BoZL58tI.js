It is located in the New Valley Governorate of southwest Egypt, near the border with Libya. History The cave and rock art was discovered in October 1933 by the Hungarian explorer L√°szl√≥ Alm√°sy. It contains Neolithic pictographs (rock painting images) and is named due to the depictions of people with their limbs bent as if they were swimming. The drawings include those of giraffe and hippopotamus. They are estimated to have been created as early as 10,000 years ago with the beginning of the African Humid Period, when the Sahara was significantly greener and wetter than it is today. The cause of the climate change 10,000 years ago was due to changes in summer solar insolation and vegetation and dust feedbacks.Charney, RMetS, 1975, Kuztbach et al, Nature, 1996, Pausata et al., EPSL, 2016 Alm√°sy devoted a chapter to the cave in his 1934 book, The Unknown Sahara. In it he postulates that the swimming scenes are real depictions of life at the time of painting and that the artists had realistically drawn their surroundings and that there had been a climatic change from temperate to xeric desert since that time making it drier. This theory was so new at that time that his first editor added several footnotes, to make it clear that he did not share this opinion. In 2007, Eman Ghoneim discovered an ancient mega-lake (30,750 km¬≤) buried beneath the sand of the Great Sahara in the Northern Darfur region, Sudan. The cave is mentioned in Michael Ondaatje's novel The English Patient. The film adaptation has a scene in it that has a guide describing in his native language to Alm√°sy, who is portrayed as a character in both the novel and the film, the location that Alm√°sy renders a drawing and includes some text that is then placed in the book that he keeps for himself.In the film, a native guide in his own language is describing to Alm√°sy the location of the caves; the scene is that just before the arrival by plane at the base camp by the Cliftons. The cave shown in the film is not the original but a film set created by a contemporary artist. Present day Physical scientists who have been conducting research in the area drew a provisional link between the proposed swimming humans and two lakes that are 124 miles (or 200 km) south of the cave. However, Andras Zboray, an archaeologist who is doing research in the area, questions whether the figures are swimming or not. He believes that the drawings are \\"clearly symbolic...with an unknown meaning.\\" Other researchers such as German ethnologist Hans Rhotert, who was involved in rock art research in North Africa and the Middle East, was the first to interpret these drawings as being that of deceased people. Jean-Lo√Øc Le Quellec, a doctor of anthropology, ethnology and prehistory, agrees with Rhotert. He has pointed out parallels to the Coffin Texts indicating that the figures are deceased souls floating in the waters of Nun. Due to similar artwork being found in nearby caves, such as the Cave of Beasts, and the continuous line that the figures create extending across a majority of the cave's interior has led researchers to believe that the cave art may display developing concepts that were later adapted to the configuration of the Nile valley. Substantial portions of the cave have been irreversibly damaged by visitors over the years, especially since the film was released in 1996. Fragments of the paintings have been removed as souvenirs and some surfaces have cracked after water was applied to 'enhance' their contrast for photographs. Modern graffiti have been inscribed upon the wall and tourist littering is a problem. Steps have been taken to reduce future damage by training guides and clearing litter from the vicinity, but this important rock art site remains fragile and risks future disturbances as tourist traffic to the region increases.

A Longman and Broderip, a single manual harpsichord, made by Thomas Culliford dated 1783, which was the first harpsichord acquired by Benton Fletcher, includes a buff stop and a pedal machine stop. An anonymous Italian harpsichordhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDd5UcLMo1I of about 1590 with original jacks and keyboard is unusual having only one string per note. It has two split accidentals allowing either chromatic or selected lower bass notes to be played with the front or back component of the \\"same\\" key. The interior of the lid features a painting of Moses and Aaron in an Italianate landscape. There are two bentside spinets. One, by John Hancock, London, is of late eighteenth century origin, with a single curve to the bentside. The other is unsigned, appears to be English and may have been made in 1742. It features a wing-shaped bent-side with a double curve as well as elegant ebony accidentals with a central ivory strip. Three of the four virginals in his collection are Italian. The oldest and lightest, dated 1540 is by Marcus Siculus of Sicily. It includes a well preserved parchment rose of extravagant tracery, and is decorated with bone studs and symmetrical floral decoration. A more robustly made virginals attributed to Vincentius PratensisWraight, Denzil \\"Identification and Authentication of Italian Stringed Keyboard Instruments in The Historical Harpsichord\\" ed. Howard Schott, Pendragon, NY 1992 was made in the late 16th or early 17th century. An unusual virginals attributed to Giovanni Celestini, Venice, also of late 16th or early 17th century construction has two rather than one string per note and a false inner-outer case,Frank Hubbard; Three Centuries of Harpsichord Making, Harvard University Press, 1970, p20 which is the custom of some Italian makers to make a case that looks as if a delicate inner instrument is lying within a protective outer case when in fact it is all one. Benton Fletcher said that he found this instrument in a cellar in Florence where it was being used as a carpenter's workbench. A late example of virginals by Robert Hatley, London, 1664, opens to reveal an inside lid and drop-down front painted with figures in 17th century dress in landscape, with applied gilt papers. There is an anonymous triple fretted German clavichord of late 17th or early 18th Century origin. A grand piano inscribed Americus Backers, London, of the late 1770s is possibly an 18th-century \\"fake\\"; the instrument is genuine but it was probably not made by Backers. There is also a square piano of eighteenth origin by Christopher Ganer, London. Instruments collected by Benton Fletcher and probably lost during the Luftwaffe raid on Holborn in 1941 include an early 16th-century Italian painted clavichord,Bavington Peter, The Missing Benton Fletcher Clavichord, British Clavichord Society Newsletter 2005, 33, p6-8 and two grand pianos, one by Matthew and William Stodart of 1791 and the second by Kirckman of 1803. A 16th-century portable pipe organ and a larger pipe organ of 1754 by Merlin were also lost. A third spinet is described by Edgar Hunt. If it was in the collection, it may have been lost then as well. In Fenton House there are four keyboard instruments acquired after the death of Benton Fletcher in 1944, which are now considered as part of the collection. There is an Ioannes Ruckers harpsichord of 1612 from Antwerp enlarged in England in the 18th century belonging to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, formerly housed in Windsor Castle, a square piano by John Broadwood of 1774, a grand piano by John Broadwood & Son, London, of 1805Wainwright, David, Broadwood by Appointment: a History 1982, and a clavichord by Arnold Dolmetsch, Haslemere, of 1925.

In 1889 she pioneered the Cadet movement in South London as a means of improving the social conditions of working class boys. Elijah Hoole, an Arts and Crafts movement architect, built the Cadets' Drill Hall, Red Cross Hall, which was decorated by Walter Crane, with painted panels of scenes of working class heroism, adjacent to Red Cross Cottages, Southwark. Red Cross Hall was also used for concerts, including a yearly performance of Handel's \\"Messiah\\". Benton Fletcher joined the Cadets as a junior officer in 1890 and lived in no 5 Red Cross Cottages in this street of social housing, two doors from the Red Cross Drill Hall.Census 1891 A letter from Octavia Hill in Jan 1891 expressed her approval of the physical and moral training of the cadets by \\"the gentlemen who are its officers\\", and mentions that \\"the band attached to the cadet corps has been taught by Mr Fletcher\\". Another letter dated February 1892 mentions \\"the present the working men's carving class have made... a beautiful clock case, carved by themselves and designed by Mr Fletcher\\". Later, in 1931, in a letter to Samuel Hield Hamer, (Secretary of the National Trust, 1911‚Äì34) about his scheme for giving his property and musical instrument collection to the National Trust, Benton Fletcher wrote: \\"it embraces education, pleasure and philanthropy, &, would I feel confident have appealed strongly to the late Octavia Hill and her sisters whose efforts to encourage the love and performance of old music fostered the like desire in my own mind during the twelve years I lived in the slums of Southwark working with & for these farseeing pioneers.\\"Fletcher, Benton, letter 1931, National Trust Collections, Scrap book of material relating to the Benton Fletcher collection of early keyboard instruments: inventory Number 3075290, Fenton House  Military career  Benton Fletcher in the uniform of a Major in the Sherwood Foresters (Nottingham and Derbyshire Regiment).

As his collection of keyboard instruments grew, and his desire to develop a music centre around them, he housed the instruments in Lord Leighton's former studio in Leighton House (1932‚Äì34).Voss EW The Amateur Musician vol 1 Oct‚ÄìDec 1934 pp 13‚Äì14 In 1934, he bought, restored and furnished Old Devonshire House in Holborn, built in 1668 for William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire,Stephen Denford and David A Hayes, Streets East of Bloomsbury, Camden History Society, 2008, pp 26-27 transferring his collection to this historic building to form a centre for early music. The National Trust had become interested in acquiring and protecting properties of historic interest as expressed in the 1937 National Trust Act. Benton Fletcher was an early donor under this scheme, donating Old Devonshire House, Holborn to the National Trust, with Cedars House Hotel and the other properties at Cobham, Surrey, adjacent to Cobham Mill and 6 Buckingham Place, SW1 in November 1937, as well as his collection of instruments and other items. \\"The income arising from the Cobham and Buckingham Place properties will be used partly to ensure the carrying on at Old Devonshire House of the centre started there by Major Benton Fletcher for the special study and performance of works of older English Composers\\".\\"Old Devonshire House\\" Times, 19 November 1937:21 The terms of the gift were such that Benton Fletcher was able to continue to live at Old Devonshire House for the rest of his life.

He was unusually enthusiastic that amateurs, students and professionals should all be encouraged to play original instruments.http://jennywoolftravel.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/apples-and- harpsichords.html He saw Old Devonshire House and the collection as a living museum, and wished to establish it on a permanent basis by his gift to the National Trust. He understood the value to performers of exploring the physical characteristics of the instruments and that performers and listeners alike responded to the distinctive sound. He expressed the view that the music of Handel and Bach was not improved when performed on modern pianos and was disparaging about the lack of sonority of 20th century revival harpsichords.Fletcher, Benton \\"Improving Handel\\" Times [London, England] 27 August 1932:6.

She was built as Daffodil but renamed Royal Daffodil in recognition of her service under requisition during the 1st World War. History =Pre war= Daffodil was built by Robert Stephenson & Sons as yard number 101. She was launched on 20 April 1906 and completed in June 1906. She was put into service as one of the Mersey ferries operating between Liverpool and Wallasey. =Zeebrugge Raid= In 1918, she was requisitioned for war service and became HMS Daffodil. Her sister ship Iris was also requisitioned and became HMS Iris II. In preparation for the Zeebrugge Raid which aimed to deny the Germans further use of the port as a u-boat base, both ships were stripped of all furniture and fittings and had armour fitted to the superstructure. The ferries were chosen because of their shallow draught and double hulls. Daffodils role was to carry two of the three seamen demolition parties, known as \\"C\\" Company and commanded by Lieutenant Cecil Dickinson, specifically tasked with using explosives for demolition work. The original plan was for the demolition team to embark the Iris, but on the day they embarked the Daffodil instead. Both the Iris and the Daffodil were towed across the Channel by HMS Vindictive for the operation on 23 April 1918. As the attack unfolded, Daffodil was hit in the engine room by two shells, but was able to maintain her position holding Vindictive against the wall of the Mole. One member of the ship's crew died during the raid. =Return to Liverpool= Iris and Daffodil returned to the Mersey on 17 May 1918, to a heroes' welcome. After repairs at Chatham, both vessels returned to service on the Mersey. =Post war= After the raid, she was renamed Royal Daffodil on command of King George VCollard p38 and returned to the Mersey, bearing shrapnel marks from the raid. In 1932 she succeeded PS Royal Iris on excursion work and in 1934 Royal Daffodil was sold to the New Medway Steam Packet Co. (NMSPC). She was used on the Rochester ‚Äì Strood ‚Äì Sheerness ‚Äì Southend route. The NMSPC was taken over by the General Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. in 1936 and in 1938 Royal Daffodil was sold for scrapping in Belgium.

Architecture  Old Devonshire House was Stuart-period brick-constructed house built in 1668 shortly after the Great Fire of London in September 1666.

Reddaway, The Rebuilding of London After the Great Fire, 1940, p 80 Jonathan Cape, London This act was drafted urgently to eliminate factors, which had caused the fire.

Brick or stone construction was mandated, with cellar brick width 2¬Ω br., 'first' and 'second' storey 2 br., 'third storey 1¬Ω br. and garret minimum 1br. The house was elegantly proportioned with the first and second storey 10 feet in height. The four tall second storey front windows unusually featured nine panels in the upper, and six in the lower casement, which gave the large front drawing room an imposing appearance.

John later built the standing house in the years between 1764 and 1785 (conflicting dates). John died in 1813 and was buried at Mount Pleasant. Mount Pleasant is an example of an almost distinctively Maryland style of house‚Äîthe English gambrel roof dwelling in brick, with the steep gambrel which has dormers almost flush with the second pitch of the roof. This house is significant primarily for its architecture and as a representative example of a more modest type of mid-Georgian dwelling than others in Maryland such as Montpelier, and probably a closer reflection of the architectural ancestry than the Palladian country house.

He is currently Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the University of Lancaster. Work Jessop's major contribution to state theory is in treating the state not as an entity but as a social relation with differential strategic effects. This means that the state is not something with an essential, fixed property such as a neutral coordinator of different social interests, an autonomous corporate actor with its own bureaucratic goals and interests, or the 'executive committee of the bourgeoisie' as often described by pluralists, elitists/statists and conventional marxists respectively. Rather, what the state is essentially determined by is the nature of the wider social relations in which it is situated, especially the balance of social forces. The state can thus be understood as follows: First, the state has varied natures, apparatuses and boundaries according to its historical and geographical developments as well as its specific conjunctures. One of these apparatuses is state projects which include a mechanism called by Jessop structural selectivity. He claims that state structures \\"offer unequal chances to different forces within and outside that state to act for different political purposes\\". However, there is a strategic limit to this variation, imposed by the given balance of forces at specific time and space. Thus, second, the state has differential effects on various political and economic strategies in a way that some are more privileged than others, but at the same time, it is the interaction among these strategies that result in such exercise of state power. This approach is called the \\"strategic-relational approach\\" and can be considered as a creative extension and development of Marx's concept of capital not as a thing but as a social relation and Antonio Gramsci's and Nicos Poulantzas's concept of the state as a social relation, something more than narrow political society. Jessop uses the term ‚Äútime sovereignty‚Äù (or ‚Äútemporal sovereignty‚Äù) to stand for a government's right to have at its disposition the time that is required for considered political decision- making. He states that this ‚Äútime sovereignty‚Äù is endangered as governments see themselves pressured to compress their own decision-making cycles so that they can make more timely and appropriate interventions.Bob Jessop Globalization: It‚Äôs about Time too!, 85, Political Science Series, Institute for Advanced Studies, Vienna, January 2003 Major works * The Capitalist State: Marxist Theories and Methods, Oxford: Blackwell 1982. * Nicos Poulantzas: Marxist Theory and Political Strategy, London: Macmillan 1985. * Thatcherism: a Tale of Two Nations, Cambridge: Polity (co-authors‚ÄîKevin Bonnett, Simon Bromley, Tom Ling) 1988. * State Theory: Putting the Capitalist State in Its Place, Cambridge: Polity 1990. * The Future of the Capitalist State, Cambridge: Polity 2002. * Beyond the Regulation Approach Putting Capitalist Economies in their Place (co-authored with Ngai-Ling Sum) Cheltenham: Edward Elgar 2006.

At the time, Racovi»õa was part of the 7th Company of the First Border Regiment in Orlat. Starting in 1698, before the village was completely militarized, the village and its area were confronted with severe religious conflicts due to the decision made by the Alba-Iulia Orthodox Church to unite with the Catholic Church. Soldiers and villagers participated enthusiastically in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Once the military border was abolished in 1851, important village members took initiative to manage the Regiment School Funds and became actively involved in the Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and the Culture of Romanian People. During World War I soldiers from Racovi»õa were involved from 1916 to 1918 and received distinctions for fighting against \\"Russian Poland\\", Galicia, Albania, Italy, Serbia and even France. Geography Racovi»õa Commune, is situated at the base of Suru Peak () on the contact between the foothills of the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Mountains and the low terrace of the floodplain, on the left bank of the Olt River, at an altitude of 385 meters.Altitudes are taken from the \\"Touristenkarte der Section \\"Hermannstadt\\" de S.K.V, Blatt II (Fogarascher Gebirge), Hermannstadt, 1921 The commune is borders to the north and northeast with the town Avrig, border which extends from the confluence of the M√¢r»ôa Valley with the Olt River to the Sorli≈£ei Peak, border established after the year 1200 S.

As of the 2019‚Äì20 season, they play in the Premier League. The club's first manager, John Bowman, was appointed in 1905. Since then, 39 men have held the job on a permanent basis. , the former Borussia Dortmund reserve-team coach Daniel Farke occupies the role. Ken Brown holds the record for most games in charge, with a total of 367 between 1980 and 1987. Excluding caretaker managers, the shortest reigns were those of George Swindin and Jimmy Jewell, who both managed 20 games; Jewell's tenure was ended by the outbreak of the Second World War. Fifteen managers have been named in the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame, some of whom were also former players. The last Norwich manager to win a major trophy was Ken Brown, who won the League Cup with Norwich in 1985. Norwich have never won the FA Cup, but have reached the FA Cup semi-finals three times ‚Äì most recently in the 1989 and 1992 competitions, but also the 1958‚Äì59 FA Cup, when Archie Macaulay managed the then third-tier club to several giant-killing victories before losing a semi-final replay to Luton Town. Norwich reached the top tier of English football for the first time in 1972, under the leadership of Ron Saunders. The highest league finish Norwich have ever achieved was third in the 1992‚Äì93 season, under Mike Walker. The following season, he managed Norwich in their only European campaign to date in the UEFA Cup, when they became the only British club to ever defeat Bayern Munich at their home ground, the Olympic Stadium. History =Early years= Norwich City was founded as an amateur football club in 1902. During the early years of the club's history, there was no manager. Arthur Turner, was the joint secretary of the club, and his wide-ranging role included that of \\"match secretary\\": according to John Eastwood, author of Canary Citizens: The Official History Of Norwich City F.C., this meant he would \\"look after the playing side\\".Eastwood, p.16 Following an FA Commission of inquiry, the club was informed on the last day of 1904 that they had been deemed a professional organisation and hence ineligible to compete in amateur football.Eastwood, p.22 The FA announced various shortcomings in the club's practices, many of which involved Turner specifically, including: > fees ... paid for the use of a gymnasium and also for the training and > massage of players. The sum of ¬£8 was also paid to a player when he left the > club. Payments were made to players without a receipt being taken. The club > advertised for players ... [the] secretary ... spent considerable sums of > money in travelling to other towns in East Anglia ... travelling expenses > were ... excessive. The club officials, including Turner, had to be removed from office and Norwich were ousted from the amateur game at the end of the season.Eastwood, p.23 The response was swift: at a meeting two days later, it was resolved to find a place in professional football. On 30 May 1905, they were elected to play in the Southern League, in place of Wellingborough. By then the club had secured their first professional manager, John Bowman. Bowman served two years in the role. He also has a place in Norwich City history for making the first recorded link between the team and its nickname \\"Canaries\\", although at this time the club nickname was \\"Citizens\\".Eastwood p.24 The earliest recorded link between the club and canaries, came in a 1905 newspaper interview with Bowman, quoting him saying: \\"Well I knew of the City's existence ... I have ... heard of the canaries.\\" At the time, this was a reference to Norwich's link to breeding canaries; the club's canary colours and crest would follow the adoption of the nickname. The Norwich City player James McEwen was appointed as manager in 1907. Tom Parker was the first Norwich manager to achieve promotion, as the club won the Division Three (South) title in the 1933‚Äì34 season, before being relegated in the 1938‚Äì39 season by the slimmest of margins ‚Äì a goal average of 0.05. Norman Low came close to regaining Second Division status in several seasons of the 1950s, but the return of Tom Parker led to ignominy of finishing bottom of the Football League in the 1956‚Äì57 season. The poor performance on the field was overshadowed by financial difficulties; the club was rescued from liquidation and reformed, with Archie Macaulay appointed as manager. =Rise to the top division= Macaulay oversaw one of Norwich City's greatest achievements: its run to the semi-final of the 1958‚Äì59 FA Cup. Competing as a Third Division side, Norwich defeated two First Division opponents along the way, notably a 3‚Äì0 win against the Manchester United \\"Busby Babes\\". City lost the semi-final only after a replay against another First Division side, Luton Town. The \\"59 Cup Run\\" as it is now known locally, \\"remains as one of the truly great periods in Norwich City's history\\" according to the club. Norwich were the third-ever Third Division team to reach the FA Cup semi-final. Macaulay then extended success to the league. In the 1959‚Äì60 season, Norwich were promoted to the Second Division after finishing behind league champions Southampton, and achieved a fourth-place finish in the 1960‚Äì61 season. From 1960, Norwich spent the next 12 seasons in the second tier, with finishes of fourth in 1961 and sixth in the 1964‚Äì65 season being among the most notable. In 1962, Willie Reid guided Norwich to their first trophy, defeating Rochdale 4‚Äì0 on aggregate in a two-legged final to win the League Cup. Norwich finally achieved promotion from Division Two when they finished as champions in the 1971‚Äì72 season under Ron Saunders; Norwich City had reached the highest level of English football for the first time. alt=Graph of Norwich City's league finishes from 1920 to 2018 Saunders capitalised on this success, taking Norwich to their first appearance at Wembley Stadium in 1973, losing the League Cup final 1‚Äì0 to Tottenham Hotspur. However, following a boardroom row after a 3‚Äì1 home defeat to Everton on 17 November 1973, Saunders resigned as manager on the spot. The new manager was John Bond who oversaw the club's relegation that season. A highly successful first season saw promotion back to the First Division and another visit to Wembley, again in the League Cup final, this time losing 1‚Äì0 to Aston Villa. Bond managed to keep Norwich in the top-tier of English football for another six seasons. The club finished tenth in the 1975‚Äì76 season; at the time their highest ever finish. Under Bond though, the club never managed to qualify for European competitions. He resigned during the 1980‚Äì81 season and the club was relegated, but returned to the top tier the following season after finishing third under new manager Ken Brown. The 1984‚Äì85 season was one of mixed fortunes for the club; a fire gutted the old Main Stand on 25 October 1984, but on the pitch, under Brown's management, they reached the final of the League Cup (known at that time as the Milk Cup) at Wembley, having defeated local rivals Ipswich Town in the semi-final. In the final, they beat Sunderland 1‚Äì0, but in the league both Norwich and Sunderland were relegated to the second tier of English football. By winning a major trophy, Brown's side qualified for the UEFA Cup, but were denied their first foray into European competition when English club sides were banned, following the Heysel Stadium disaster. City made an immediate return to the top flight by winning the Second Division championship in the 1985‚Äì86 season. Brown's success continued into the 1986‚Äì87 season, when Norwich finished fifth, but following the departure of his assistant, Mel Machin, the club made a weak start to the following season and Brown was dismissed in November 1987. Dave Stringer, who had made nearly 500 appearances for City as a player, was appointed manager. He kept Norwich in the top tier and the following season the club finished fourth, which, like the 1986‚Äì87 season, would have been enough for 1989‚Äì90 UEFA Cup qualification, but the ban on English clubs was still in place. Stringer also managed to guide City to the semi-finals of the 1988‚Äì89 FA Cup and repeated the feat in the 1991‚Äì92 tournament. However, the 1991‚Äì92 season saw Norwich flirt with relegation and finished 18th, leading to Stringer's resignation. =Premier League, Europe and club centenary= Mike Walker was Stringer's permanent successor. He arrived at Norwich City before the 1992‚Äì93 inaugural season of the English Premier League. Media and pundits tipped Norwich for a season of struggle, but the club led the league for much of the season, and eventually finished third. It was the club's highest ever finish and Norwich qualified for European football. Walker's team played in the 1993‚Äì94 UEFA Cup, defeating Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem 3‚Äì0 in the first round. In the second round, they faced Bayern Munich. Norwich won the tie 3‚Äì2 on aggregate; their 2‚Äì1 victory in Munich earning Norwich a place in history, as the only English team to beat Bayern Munich in the Olympic Stadium. The win in Munich was described in The Independent as \\"the pinnacle of Norwich City's history\\". Reflecting on the result, FourFourTwo wrote \\"The news that Norwich had gone 2‚Äì0 up in the Olympic Stadium seemed frankly surreal.\\" Norwich's cup run was ended by Inter Milan, who defeated them 2‚Äì0 over two legs. Walker's success at Norwich attracted attention and, in January 1994, he left the club to take charge of Everton. Walker had commented to the press earlier in his time at Norwich that \\"to earn a decent salary\\" from chairman Robert Chase, he'd have to \\"win the League, FA Cup and Eurovision Song Contest every year.\\" Walker's replacement was the first team coach John Deehan, assisted by Gary Megson, then still a player. Deehan led the club to 12th place in the 1993‚Äì94 season in the Premier League. During the 1994 close season, the club sold the 21-year-old striker Chris Sutton to Blackburn Rovers for a then British record fee of ¬£5 million. By Christmas of the 1994‚Äì95 season, Norwich City were seventh in the Premiership and challenging for a return to the UEFA Cup, but, following a serious injury to goalkeeper Bryan Gunn, the club's performance dipped; with just one win in their final twenty Premiership fixtures, Norwich dropped to 20th place and were relegated to the second tier of English football. Deehan resigned just before relegation was confirmed; he was replaced in the summer of 1995 by former Norwich player Martin O'Neill, who had taken Wycombe Wanderers from the Conference to the Second Division with successive promotions. alt=A man and a woman holding white T-shirts in front of themselves O'Neill's tenure lasted just six months; he resigned after a dispute with chairman Robert Chase over Chase's refusal to permit O'Neill to spend significant sums on strengthening the squad. According to O'Neill, the tipping point was the refusal of Chase to permit the purchase of Dean Windass. Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players, refused to reinvest in new players and consequently was to blame for relegation. Gary Megson was appointed Norwich manager on a temporary basis for the second time in eight months: he had also briefly filled this role after Deehan's departure. Megson remained in charge until the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season before leaving the club. Mike Walker, who had struggled at Everton, was re-appointed as the club's manager. He was unable to repeat the success achieved during his first spell and was sacked in the 1997‚Äì98 season with Norwich mid-table in the First Division. Walker's successor Bruce Rioch lasted two seasons and departed in the summer of 2000. While Rioch failed to gain promotion, his time at Norwich did leave a lasting impact in his man- management of Iwan Roberts, who had been struggling to perform. Roberts himself has ascribed his difficulties to being overweight; the turnaround was, according to Roberts, due to some clever psychology by Rioch. Roberts scored 23 goals in the 1998‚Äì99 season, and is now in the club's Hall of Fame. Rioch's successor, Bryan Hamilton, had been appointed as director of football when Rioch took on the manager role; he lasted in the manager's job for six months before he resigned with the club 20th in the First Division, and in real danger of relegation to the third tier of English football for the first time since the 1960s. The new appointee was Nigel Worthington, who had been Hamilton's assistant manager. Worthington's time as Norwich manager was one of peaks and troughs, with mid-table comfort a rarity. In his first part-season, he successfully steered the team away from the threat of relegation. The following season, Norwich exceeded expectations and reached the play-off final, losing to Birmingham City on penalties. alt=Footballers celebrating with a large cardboard fake trophy After a season of consolidation, Worthington led the club to the First Division title in the 2003‚Äì04 season, a success achieved by a margin of eight points and Norwich returned to the top flight for the first time in nine years. For much of the 2004‚Äì05 season, the club struggled in the Premiership, but the team staged a comeback in the final weeks of the season. Norwich, who had not won in months, suddenly went on a run, securing 13 points out of 18. With the bottom three sides to be automatically relegated, on the last day of the season, the club were fourth from bottom and a win would have kept them in top flight football, but a 6‚Äì0 away defeat to Fulham condemned them to relegation. The club was expected to make a quick return to the Premiership in the 2005‚Äì06 season, but poor performances began to turn the fans against Worthington. Dean Ashton was sold for a club-record ¬£7 m, approximately a 100% profit on the fee they had paid just one year earlier. Half of Ashton's fee was immediately reinvested in the purchase of Welsh striker Robert Earnshaw, who helped the Canaries' revival to a ninth-place finish. Worthington made just one permanent signing prior to the 2006‚Äì07 season, and when a poor run of form ensued, leaving the club in 17th place in the Championship, he was dismissed. Former City player Peter Grant left West Ham to become the new manager. Grant brought in fellow Scot, Jim Duffy, as his assistant, and managed to lift the side to finish 16th in the league. During the 2007 close season, Grant brought in nine players; however ten players, including Earnshaw, departed. Darren Huckerby remained but caused controversy by criticising the club for selling their best players and berating his fellow players. When the 2007‚Äì08 season opened with only two Norwich wins by 9 October 2007, Grant left the club by \\"mutual consent\\". At the end of October, former Newcastle United boss Glenn Roeder was confirmed as the new manager. Roeder released a number of players, largely replacing them with inexperienced loan signings. Results improved significantly, lifting the club from five points adrift at the foot of the table to a comfortable mid- table position. Norwich were in 12th position by 28 February 2008. Following a poor first half of the 2008‚Äì09 campaign, it was announced in January 2009 that Roeder had been relieved of his first team duties. The appointment of Bryan Gunn as temporary manager did not prevent relegation to the third tier of English league football (League One), a level the club had not played at since 1960, at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 Championship season. Norwich started their League One campaign on 8 August 2009 at home to fellow East Anglians Colchester United. They were widely expected to return swiftly to the Championship, however they suffered a 1‚Äì7 defeat. This was their worst home defeat in their 107-year history. Gunn was sacked six days later, and the club moved swiftly to appoint the man who had contributed to his downfall: Colchester manager Paul Lambert. He led Norwich to the League 1 title and promotion to the Championship in April 2010. He oversaw a turnaround in fortunes to lead Norwich to promotion back to The Championship as League One champions, during the 2009‚Äì10 season that included a 16-league-game unbeaten run that included just two draws. The 2010‚Äì11 season saw Norwich promoted to the Premier League, the first time the club had been promoted two years running. After a successful 2011‚Äì12 season, finishing twelfth, Lambert resigned as Norwich manager in June 2012, moving to Aston Villa. Lambert was replaced by Birmingham City's manager Chris Hughton. With Norwich one place above the relegation zone and five matches remaining in the 2013‚Äì14 season, Hughton was sacked, and replaced by youth coach and former Norwich player Neil Adams. However, they could not avoid the drop to the Championship. Under Adams, Norwich began the 2014‚Äì15 season in the Championship with good form and were second in the table in September, but performances became mixed, the club slid to seventh place and a 2‚Äì0 defeat in the 2014‚Äì15 FA Cup by Preston North End F.C. (then in League One) led to Adams' resignation. He was replaced by Hamilton Academical coach Alex Neil. A revitalised and disciplined Canaries side achieved 17 victories in the remaining 25 games, qualifying for the end of season Football League playoffs. Neil's side secured victory over local rivals Ipswich Town, before defeating Middlesbrough in the final at Wembley Stadium, to return to the Premier League. Norwich's spell in the top flight lasted just one season, and Neil's side were expected to be contenders for the Championship title in the 2016‚Äì17 season. The side were second in the table early in the season, but a dip in form saw the Board sack Neil in March 2017, placing Alan Irvine in temporary charge. On 25 May 2017, the German Borussia Dortmund reserve team coach Daniel Farke replaced Irvine as manager of the club on a two-year contract, becoming the first non-British manager of Norwich City. Managers Norwich City celebrated its centenary in 2002, in the course of which a Hall of Fame was created.

The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships does not record her class, although some other sources (such as Navsource) do. Unlike the majority of ships of the class she was never formally reclassified an attack transport (APA); however, she was originally a sister ship of the other ships in the class and like them she appears to have served in the attack transport role during the war. that served with the US Navy during World War II. President Monroe was the sixth of seven C3-P&C; type vessels built for American President Lines around-the-world service just prior to the outbreak of World War II. She was laid down 13 November 1939 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News, Virginia and launched 7 August 1940. World War II The new President Monroe was just clearing San Francisco Bay on her maiden voyage around the world when word was flashed to her Master to return, as Japan had just attacked Pearl Harbor. She and her six sisterships were immediately acquired by War Shipping Administration on bareboat charter for outfitting for war service. President Monroe departed San Francisco 12 January 1942 destined for Suva in the Australian ‚Äì Suva convoy with two other troopships, the President Coolidge and the Mariposa, which were destined for Australia, accompanied by two destroyers and the light cruiser . This was the first large convoy to Australia and the south Pacific after Pearl Harbor with Mariposa and Coolidge transporting Army personnel ammunition and fifty P-40 fighters intended for the Philippines and Java. Monroe landed 660 troops, an air warning company and a pursuit squadron at Suva on 29 January 1942. On 17 July 1942 the ship that was only partially converted for troop transport departed San Francisco, escorted most of the first day by a blimp and destroyer escort, transporting the 7th Naval Construction Battalion to Pago Pago arriving around noon on 28 July and spending the next few days unloading. Transferred to the Navy 18 July 1943 under WSA bareboat charter to the Navy, President Monroe shifted to Pool, McGonigle & Jennings Company yard of Portland, Oregon for alterations. Commissioned 20 August as the USS President Monroe (AP-104), Capt. G. C. Morrison in command, she departed Portland 24 August for the Bremerton Navy Yard for conversion and outfitting. After brief shakedown, she commenced her first \\"pay\\" run 9 September on the Aleutian Service. Carrying replacement troops and cargo, she steamed for Kodiak, Dutch Harbor, and Adak, Alaska. She also embarked assault troops at Kiska and transported them to Pearl Harbor, and then returned to San Francisco to be outfitted with landing craft. =Gilbert Islands invasion= Departing the west coast 3 November, President Monroe joined forces that were marshaling at Pearl Harbor for the first move of the Central Pacific Drivethe Gilbert Islands invasion. She arrived Abemama Atoll on the morning of the 27th bringing the atoll's garrison group cargo and personnel. She touched at Tarawa before sailing for Pearl Harbor with battleship and transport . =Marshall Islands operations= She remained at Pearl Harbor until 23 January 1944, when she embarked a contingent of marines and steamed for Kwajalein Atoll. She next transported assault troops to Eniwetok, participating through 25 February in the successful landings on Engebi, Enewetak Atoll and Parry Island. Departing Roi-Namur, Kwajalein Atoll 29 February, she called at Funafuti, Ellice Islands, and then was routed to Guadalcanal. =Invasion of Guam= Following a cruise to Milne Bay, Manus Island and New Caledonia, the transport engaged in logistics and practice landings for the assault on Guam. On 4 April 1944 she departed Espiritu Santo with the main body, 27 officers and 943 enlisted men, of the 44th Naval Construction Battalion to join advance groups at Manus on 17 April. Between 21 and 26 July, she discharged troops and cargo off Guam, then steamed for Eniwetok to embark wounded before proceeding to San Pedro, California, arriving 22 August 1944. By 4 November, she once again stood out from San Diego and ended the year operating between Guadalcanal, New Caledonia, and Port Purvis on Florida Island in the Solomons. She joined the well-screened Task Group 77.9 en route Lingayen Gulf 2 January 1945, and unloaded troops and cargo in the San Fabian area between 11 and 13 January. Propulsion problems necessitated repairs at Leyte, after which she steamed in convoy for Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, thence to Ulithi. There she was designated flagship for Transport Division \\"D\\" of Task Unit 12.6.1 and steamed for Iwo Jima, arriving 18 March. Embarking troops there, she steamed for Hawaii, en route to San Francisco. =After hostilities= Through the end of 1945 she made several runs to Pacific Island bases. With the end of hostilities, she extended her cruises to Japan and participated in Operation Magic Carpet, the giant sealift organized to bring demobilizing servicemen home. =Awards= President Monroe received five battle stars for World War II service. =Famous passengers= Lieutenant Junior Grade Richard Nixon shipped out from San Francisco to the South Pacific aboard the President Monroe in 1943. Decommission President Monroe entered Hunters Point Naval Drydock 12 January 1946, decommissioned, and was delivered to WSA 30 January, returned to American President Lines 21 February, and stricken from the Navy List 12 March. Commercial service Following decommission, President Monroe was returned to American President Lines for commercial service on 21 February 1947. She was sold 21 December 1965 to a Greek Shipping Company, flagged in Panama and renamed Marianna V. She was scrapped in 1973.

At completion, two classroom wings (designated \\"N\\" and \\"C\\" and a technical wing (designated \\"S\\") were constructed. In later years, a gymnasium/canteen complex was constructed, being partially funded by the former City of Nunawading as well as a football/cricket oval and soccer field. The school changed its name to Vermont Secondary College in 1991. Vermont Secondary College school provides education for years 7-12 in the VCE system. The school has recently undergone significant renovations with 2 of the 3 LTC wings undergoing significant remodelling and partial demolition and a 4th wing consisting of 12 portable class rooms being added. The grounds have also been improved with a fenced artificial surface soccer pitch being added as well as new set of asphalt netball/basketball courts with line markings for tennis also. In 2010 the school structure was also significantly altered with a house system of 3 houses introduced. The houses are Hotham (Blue house), Macedon (Green house) & Stirling (Red house). The 3 Houses are all of which named after mountains to go with the school's previous tradition. Each house has a male and female house captain from year 12. There are also now two school captains, a male and a female chosen from year 12. The school has a strong reputation for both academic success and sporting success with many sports teams making state finals. The school also has a strong music program although it has suffered significant downsizing as a result of funding redistribution in recent years.

In addition Specialisterne assesses and trains people with ASD to meet the requirements of the business sector. The company provides a working environment in which ASD is integral, and where the role of the management and staff is to create the best possible working environment for the employees with ASD.  Background  The youngest son of Specialisterne founder Thorkil Sonne, Lars, was diagnosed as having \\"infantile autism, normal intelligence\\", at age three, denoting and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Thorkil became active in the Danish Autism Association, then president of a local chapter of Autism Denmark, for three years, where he learned that people with ASD seldom have a chance to use their special skills in the labour market. After 15 years working with IT within telecommunication companies, Thorkil knew the value of the skills he saw in people with ASD.

Various problems in fluid mechanics can be approximated to Hele-Shaw flows and thus the research of these flows is of importance. Approximation to Hele-Shaw flow is specifically important to micro-flows. This is due to manufacturing techniques, which creates shallow planar configurations, and the typically low Reynolds numbers of micro-flows. The governing equation of Hele-Shaw flows is identical to that of the inviscid potential flow and to the flow of fluid through a porous medium (Darcy's law). It thus permits visualization of this kind of flow in two dimensions.Hermann Schlichting,Boundary Layer Theory, 7th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1979.L. M. Milne-Thomson (1996). Theoretical Hydrodynamics. Dover Publications, Inc.Horace Lamb, Hydrodynamics (1934). Mathematical formulation of Hele-Shaw flows A schematic description of a Hele-Shaw configuration. Let x, y be the directions parallel to the flat plates, and z the perpendicular direction, with 2H being the gap between the plates (at z=\\\\pm H). When the gap between plates is asymptotically small : H \\\\rightarrow 0, \\\\, the velocity profile in the z direction is parabolic (i.e. is a quadratic function of the coordinate in this direction). The equation relating the pressure gradient to the velocity is, : {\\\\mathbf u}={\\\\mathbf abla} p \\\\frac{z^2-H^2}{2\\\\mu} \\\\, where {\\\\mathbf u} is the velocity, p(x,y,t) is the local pressure, \\\\mu is the fluid viscosity. This relation and the uniformity of the pressure in the narrow direction z permits us to integrate the velocity with regard to z and thus to consider an effective velocity field in only the two dimensions x and y. When substituting this equation into the continuity equation and integrating over z we obtain the governing equation of Hele-Shaw flows, the Laplace Equation: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 p}{\\\\partial x^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 p}{\\\\partial y^2}=0. This equation is supplemented by the no-penetration boundary conditions on the side walls of the geometry, : {\\\\mathbf abla} p \\\\cdot \\\\hat n= 0, \\\\, where \\\\hat n is a unit vector perpendicular to the side wall. Hele-Shaw cell The term Hele-Shaw cell is commonly used for cases in which a fluid is injected into the shallow geometry from above or below the geometry, and when the fluid is bounded by another liquid or gas. For such flows the boundary conditions are defined by pressures and surface tensions.

The park has been operated by the Beasley family since 1967, currently through Etobicoke-based William Beasley Enterprises Limited, on land leased from the City of Toronto government and is open daily during the summer. Beasley also operates the \\"Far Enough Farm\\" adjacent to the park. History An antique ferris wheel designed to look like a windmill. It is one of several rides and park buildings that have a 1900s turn-of-the-century village theme. Centreville was built as part of a master plan to convert the Toronto Islands land usage from cottage residences to recreational uses. The park replaced the old Sunnyside Amusement Park, which closed in 1955, as well as Hanlan's Point Amusement Park, which closed in the 1930s to make way for the island airport. The park opened in 1967, operated by Bill Beasley Sr., father of the current president of William Beasley Enterprises. The park originally had seven rides and has expanded over the years, adding one or two rides a year. The park's buildings have a 1900s turn-of-the-century village theme. An 1870s cast iron planter to commemorate Queen Victoria's birthday that was originally located in front of St. Lawrence Market is now featured in the center of the park. In 2013, Centreville took over operations of Far Enough Farm, which was threatened with closure. At the same time, the City extended its lease to 2022. Due to flooding of many areas of the Toronto Islands, Centreville did not open in May 2017. In late June, the animals at the Centreville Far Enough were moved off the island. Centreville reopened on July 31, except for the Far Enough Farm, which remained closed until 2018 due to flood damage. Three rides were no operational: the swan ride, bumper boat ride (due to high water levels) and the train ride (because of flood damage to the tracks). Mosquitos carrying the West Nile virus had been found on the islands but the Toronto Public Health department said that with certain precautions, visitors should not be concerned. A park spokesman said that the loss in revenue was due to the flood and the cost of repairs was estimated at . In June 2017, Centreville purchased a used ferry boat, the Dartmouth III, from Halifax Transit in Nova Scotia for . Beasley plans to operate its own service to the amusement park in peak season (supplementing the public Toronto Island ferries), though probably not until 2018. The boat can carry 390 passengers per trip. Due to health and safety concerns amid the global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, the Centreville Amusement Park (like many other amusement/theme parks in Ontario, including nearby Canada's Wonderland in Vaughan) was closed for the 2020 season. Attractions Toronto Island Monster was a miniature roller coaster that existed at the park from 1995‚Äì2013. The park attractions include a carousel, log flume, a Ferris wheel (acquired from Crystal Beach Park in Fort Erie, Ontario in 1989), a 'haunted barrel works', an enclosed \\"Scrambler\\", a miniature roller coaster, pleasure swan boats, bumper boats, antique-style motor cars and several kiddie rides, such as the tea cups, a swing boat, drop ride and miniature fire engines. There are several food concessions, some games and a gift shop. There is also a wading pool, pony rides and miniature golf. One of three miniature train rides in Toronto operates at the park (the others being at John Street Roundhouse and Woodbine Centre). It consists of two trains (the \\"Lil Red Express\\" and \\"Lil Blue Express\\" respectively) with five passenger cars (cars about 14 to 21 passengers) on a narrow gauge track which circles the park grounds and farm and travels through a tunnel. An aerial ride, the \\"Sky Ride,\\" operated for some years at the park. Installed in 1968, it was a chairlift type and carried passengers from a point near the entrance to near St. Andrew's Church and back. In 1995 a sailboat hit the Sky Ride and knocked a passenger out of her seat; she hung upside down for 45 minutes before being rescued. In 2010 a patron was injured while being loaded onto a chair and Beasley lost a court judgment of over for the accident in 2015. The ride was subsequently closed but a new version went into operation in early August 2017. =Carousel= The park includes a vintage 1907-vintage carousel made by the Dentzel Carousel Company, one of 150 that remain in operation. The park has a 1907-vintage carousel made by the Dentzel Carousel Company, one of 150 of this type that remains in operation, acquired from Bushkill Park in Easton, Pennsylvania. Its 52 hand-carved animals include cats, an ostrich, pigs, a lion and rabbits instead of the more common style consisting primarily of horses. Of the 52, 36 move up and down on brass poles. Other features include two ornate bench seats and a Welte-Mignon/Wurlitzer band organ. Mandated by the park's financial losses in the summer of 2017, the carousel was conditionally sold to the city of Carmel, Indiana. The sale was due to an estimated loss when it was unable to open due to flooding of the area by high lake levels, according to the president of Beasley Enterprises. The estimated selling price was , approximately . On July 31, Beasley was quoted as saying he has not yet accepted the offer and that Toronto Mayor John Tory was interested in keeping the carousel in Toronto. Beasley considered the purchase of a new carousel that would be on site at Centreville by the 2018 park season. The Dentzel carousel is expected to be shipped to Carmel in November 2017 to open in 2018 or 2019 as part of a multi-year downtown redevelopment project. An announcement on Centreville's Facebook page on July 20 indicates that the carousel would continue in operation on the island for the 2017 season. In mid-September 2017, the sale of the carousel to Carmel was in doubt after that city's finance committee recommended that this item be removed from the budget for the redevelopment plan and that Carmel City Council would vote on the proposal on September 18. On September 19, it was confirmed that Carmel was not purchasing the ride and will stay put to solicit other buyers.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/centreville-carousel-no-go- carmel-1.4296625 As of 2018 season, the ride will remain after negotiations with the city over rent and debts forgiven by Beasley's suppliers.https://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto- star/20180519/281496456940218 =Far Enough Farm= Also maintained by William Beasley Enterprises Limited, the Far Enough Farm exists on the eastern outskirts of the Amusement Park, just past the Toronto Island Mine Roller Coaster Ride. The hobby farm opened in 1959 and is home to several domesticated animal species including rabbits, goats, pigs, chickens, cows and ponies as well as emus and peafowl which often freely roam around the farm. The farm is staffed by a manager with farmers and farm hands employed by Beasley and is normally open 365 days a year, except in 2017 when it closed in May and would not reopen for many months due to flood damage. In the meantime, the animals were being sheltered at the family's equine facility in nearby Schomberg, Ontario.  Dartmouth III ferry William Beasley Enterprises Limited purchased a used Halifax Transit ferry Dartmouth III in the summer of 2017 to add to the island's ferry fleet.http://www.blogto.com/city/2017/07/toronto-islands-new-ferry-2017/ It will be privately run and not part of the city-run ferry service. After the 2017 flooding, the city made adjustments to their ferry docks to make them operational even with flooding, thus leaving the need for the Dartmouth in question. The ferry was in Toronto in early 2018 and appears to have been decommissioned again in 2019.

Despite its name, it is only a partially selective school, with 25% of entrants admitted on academic ability and 10% on musical aptitude. Its GCSE results were the highest achieved by non-grammar state schools in England in 2007.  History  The Girls' school and its brother school, Watford Grammar School for Boys, descend from a Free School founded as a charity school for boys and girls by Elizabeth Fuller in 1704 and refounded as a secondary school in 1884. The school has occupied its present site in central Watford since 1907. The name Watford Grammar School for Girls dates from 1903. Although the school ceased to be a tripartite system grammar school in 1975, it retains some features of the grammar school tradition. The school site is divided in two by a public footpath, with a footbridge spanning the path to connect the two parts. The northern part includes a former private house, Lady's Close now used as the English block. Also in the northern part is the PE block and Fuller Life Gym (with a swimming pool), open to members of the public in non-school hours. A new building, Hyde House, is also situated in the northern part. Except during the First World War, when it was taken over by the Red Cross as an auxiliary hospital, the building served as the school's preparatory department until that department was closed in 1944. Since then it has served as the home of the entry form to the school.Hart (2005), pp. 79‚Äì80, 140.  The school today  Watford Girls has been partially selective since 1995, though the proportion of selection has been reduced over this period. The school also gives priority to sisters of current pupils at the school. Prior to 2008 it also gave extra consideration during the selection process to sisters of pupils of Watford Grammar School for Boys. Its admission area reaches out about , including some northern parts of the London boroughs of Harrow and Hillingdon. In comparison with the national average, its intake has significantly higher academic attainment, greater ethnic diversity and fewer children receiving free school meals., Ofsted. An inspection in 2007 by the Office for Standards in Education rated the school as outstanding in all categories. It has long been near the top of performance tables for comprehensive schools, but when the key measure at GCSE was changed in 2007 to include English and mathematics the school moved to the top position. The then-headmistress, Dame Helen Hyde, attributed part of their success to De Bono Thinking Tools, for which the school was one of the first in the United Kingdom to receive accreditation as a national training school.

He served in the North Carolina House of Commons and State Senate prior to the U.S. Civil War. He represented North Carolina in the Provisional Confederate Congress. He was an outspoken advocate of higher education, graduate of the University of North Carolina and member of the Board of Trustees of the university. Early life Born at Swan Ponds in Burke County, North Carolina, he was the brother of Isaac E. Avery, the son of Isaac Thomas Avery, and the grandson of Waightstill Avery. In 1837 Avery graduated from the University of North Carolina and delivered the valedictory address at the graduation ceremony. In 1846 Avery married Mary Corinna Morehead, the daughter of Gov. John Motley Morehead. At Marion, N.C. in the fall of 1851, Avery was beaten with a cowhide whip by Samuel Fleming, a merchant from Burnsville, who was a participant in a lawsuit in which Avery appeared as legal counsel for Ephraim Greenlee. Avery was unarmed and a smaller man than Fleming. He could not defend himself. Several weeks later Fleming came to Morganton bragging of his courage and making unpleasant comments about Avery. When Fleming appeared in the courtroom and stood five feet from Avery and near the presiding judge, Avery shot Fleming dead where he stood. Avery was brought to trial for murder but was acquitted on the grounds of extreme provocation leading to temporary insanity. Political career A Democrat, Avery served in the North Carolina House of Commons and later in the North Carolina Senate to which he was elected Speaker in 1856. He ran for Congress in 1858, but a split among the Democrats led to a victory by Zebulon B. Vance. In 1860 Avery was a representative to the Democratic Party Convention in Charleston. He had a prominent role on the committee which wrote the party platform, which divided the party over how to address the issue of slavery, particularly the Fugitive Slave Act. Due to this, there was a later convention held in Baltimore which did not include delegates from several slave states and divided the Democratic party into Northern and Southern factions leading up to the election of 1860. After North Carolina seceded from the union in 1861, Avery was chosen to represent the state in the Provisional Confederate Congress. Then, he returned to Burke County to raise a regiment for the Confederate States Army. Several of Avery's brothers had prominent roles in the Confederate Army, most notably Isaac Avery who was killed while leading his regiment at Gettysburg, but William Waightstill Avery spent most of the Civil War in Morganton attending to family business. He died in Morganton from wounds received in a skirmish with a party of Tennessee Unionists in 1864 after a raid on Camp Vance by the Union's 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry.

The operated system consists of high pressure gas pipelines with pressure exceeding . Status GRTgaz is a public limited company, a subsidiary of the industrial group ENGIE (formerly Gaz de France). It was created on 1 January 2005 in application of European directives on the European electricity and gas market. GRTgaz operates in the regulated energy sector: this means that the rates it charges for its services are public and set by the Government. Its activities are monitored by the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE). Its board of directors is made up of representatives of the Government and of personnel, independent directors and representatives of the ENGIE Group. Thierry Trouv√© has been CEO of the company from April 26, 2013, taking over from Philippe Boucly. Even though the GRTgaz activity is a natural monopoly, the company does not manage all natural gas transmission in France: Ter√©ga, formerly TIGF, an affiliate of the Snam / GIC / EDF consortium manages the transmission system in the southwest quadrant of France. GRTgaz also has an affiliate in Germany, GRTgaz Deutschland (30 employees), which works with Open Grid Europe to operate the MEGAL gas pipeline connecting the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and France. The pipeline notably supplies natural gas to southern Germany and France.  Missions  GRTgaz has a dual role: *to transport natural gas to industrial customers and public distribution networks, at optimum cost and in maximum safety, *to support the opening up of the energy market in France by providing equal access to the transmission system to all licensed natural gas shippers. GRTgaz has a public service role: it guarantees a continuous supply of natural gas, even in times of extreme cold. Under French law, even in the event of exceptionally cold conditions, as may occur every 50 years, the transmission system must be able to meet peak consumer demand. The law defines this concept of exceptionally cold conditions as follows: *a cold winter such as occurs statistically every 50 years, *or a period of extremely low temperature lasting a maximum of three days, as occurs statistically every 50 years. Currently, these temperatures, as calculated from previous winters, are around -1.5 ¬∞C on average across France, with a minimum of -18.1 ¬∞C and a maximum of -1 ¬∞C, depending on the location.  Transmission system  Since its creation, GRTgaz has owned and operated the transmission network as its industrial equipment and primary asset. = Natural gas transmission pipelines managed by GRTgaz = The pipeline network managed by GRTgaz covers all of France except the southwest corner. It includes: * a primary network spanning a distance of 8,346 km at the end of 2015: composed of the largest pipes (diameters from 400 mm to 1,200 mm and pressure from 67.7 to 95 bar, varying periodically), * a regional network measuring 23,974 m at the end of 2015: from smaller diameters (diameters from 80 mm to 400 mm; pressure from 16 to 40 bar), these gas pipelines supply industrial customers and public grids. Gas pipelines are almost always buried and typically located in rural areas (90%). Gas pipelines are marked on the ground level by yellow panels and an easement strip of 5 to 20 m that must remain visible and unobstructed by surrounding vegetation or construction.  Investments  GRTgaz laid out a 10-year investment program to develop and optimize its industrial facilities. The program pursues the following goals: * network development: load reduction at entry and exit points, increasing transmission capacity; * meeting public service requirements: notably scaling the regional network in response to consumption spikes during exceptionally cold winters; * network security: applying security norms, revised in 2006, governing construction on existing gas pipelines and compression stations, in order to protect populations and the environment; * preserving the environment: applying new and updated environmental regulations to our projects, ISO 14001 certification for compression stations; * reliability and maintenance of facilities. GRTgaz already invested over 2 billion euros between 2013 and 2015, notably to develop the \\"Hauts de France II\\" and \\"Arc de Dierrey\\" projects (180 km) to connect the new Dunkirk LNG terminal or develop interconnections with Belgium, Germany and Spain.  New energy solutions  GRTgaz is active in the renewable gas industry. It makes it possible for the gas network to accept biomethane, which can be produced by methanation using household waste, biomass or sewage from purification plants. The first station to connect biomethane to the French transmission network was commissioned in Chagny (Sa√¥ne-et-Loire) in 2015. GRTgaz also invested in power to gas conversion, which makes it possible both to use surplus renewable electricity and recycle industrial CO2 emissions. Methane produced through methanation can then be injected into the gas transmission system. Decided in 2015, the first industrial pilot of this type, Jupiter 1000, coordinated by GRTgaz, will be built at Fos-sur-Mer, with commissioning planned in 2018. In the natural gas vehicles (NGV) market, GRTgaz was named by the French association for natural gas vehicles to prepare a roadmap for introducing NGV technology in France by 2020. The goal is to install over 200 new public recharge stations to reach a fleet of 11,000 trucks and 20,000 utility vehicles.

Identification of organisms to individual scientific names (or codes) may be based on individualistic natural body features,D.Burns, P.Harrison and P. Baverstock. Photographic identification of individual humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) on their southern migration past Ballina, NSW, with comparisons to other humpback whale databases from eastern Australia experimentally created individual markers (e.g., color dot patterns), or natural individualistic molecular markers (similar to those used in maternity or paternity identification tests). Individual identification is used in ecology, wildlife management and conservation biology. The more common form of identification is the identification of organisms to common names (e. g., \\"lion\\") or scientific name (e. g., \\"Panthera leo\\"). By necessity this is based on inherited features (\\"characters\\") of the sexual organisms, the inheritance forming the basis of defining a class. The features may, e. g., be morphological, anatomical, physiological, behavioral, or molecular. The term \\"determination\\" may occasionally be used as a synonym for identification (e. g.), or as in \\"determination slips\\". Identification methods may be manual or computerized and may involve using identification keys, browsing through fields guide that contain (often illustrated) species accounts, comparing the organism with specimens from natural history collections, or taking images to be analyzed and compared against a pre-trained knowledge base with species information.

Established in 1955, the company is chaired by Gina Rinehart, estimated to be the wealthiest person in Australia, and the daughter of the company's founder, the late Lang Hancock. Upon resuming the Executive Chairmanship, Mrs Rinehart took over a company that was in a perilous financial position with significant debt and major assets mortgages and under threat of seizure. Hancock holds the rights to some of the largest land leases in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, containing the world's largest iron ore deposit. It is owned by Gina Rinehart (76.6%) and the Hope Margaret Hancock Trust (23.4%). In August 2016, former politician Sophie Mirabella is now the general manager of media relations for this company. Activities The Hancock Group of Companies are holders of numerous iron ore leases in the Pilbara. The leases cover an area of predominantly in the Central Pilbara region and contain mineable reserves of Brockman and Marra Mamba ore of over 850 million tonnes. Leases in the Eastern Pilbara region contain mineable reserves of Marra Mamba ore of over 2 billion tonnes, and over 500 million tonnes of ferruginous manganese in their Nicholas Downs Project, which is a joint venture with mining services company Mineral Resources Limited. In 2011, the company was estimated to be earning about A$870 million in revenue per year. This is based on a 50% share of profits generated at the Hope Downs mine which is operated by Rio Tinto. Hope Downs production levels of 30 million tonnes per year and current prices (around US$140 per tonne) generate over A$2 billion in revenue, and about A$700 million in net cash. In addition, the company receives a 1.25% royalty from iron ore sales by Hamersley Iron (a Rio Tinto subsidiary) which delivers about A$170 million a year. Hancock Prospecting exploration activities are done under the Jacaranda Alliance, a joint venture between Hancock, Minerals Australia Pty Ltd, and several former executives of Rio Tinto. Exploration and evaluation work on uranium, molybdenum, lead, zinc, gold, diamonds and petroleum deposits are conducted in Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and South East Asia. As of 2016, Hancock Prospecting began to diversify its interests into the cattle industry, acquiring 67% of S. Kidman & Co. At stages of its trading, the company has been known as Hancock Prospecting Ltd, Hancock Resources, Hanwright Pty Ltd, Hancock & Wright Ltd, and Hancock Prospecting Pty. Ltd. Hancock Prospecting significantly funds the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA), paying the IPA $2.3 million in financial year 2016 and $2.2 million in financial year 2017, which represents one-third to a half of the IPA's total revenue in those years. These payments were not disclosed in IPA annual reports, and Rinehart's daughter Bianca Hope Heyward submitted in court that the Hancock Prospecting payments were credited to Rinehart in an individual capacity. Gina Rinehart was made a life member of the IPA in November 2016. Hope Margaret Hancock Trust In 1988 Lang Hancock established the Hope Margaret Hancock Trust, nominating Rinehart as trustee, with his four grandchildren named as beneficiaries. The Trust owns a quarter of the shares in Hancock Prospecting. In 2011 Rinehart's daughter, Hope Rinehart Welker, commenced a commercial action in the New South Wales Supreme Court for reasons understood to be related to the conduct of the trustee. The action sought to remove Rinehart as sole trustee. Her brother, John, and sister, Bianca, were later revealed as parties to the dispute. In an agreement reached between the parties, the Court granted an interim non-publication order in September 2011. In making the interim order, Justice Paul Brereton stated: \\"This is not the first occasion of discord in the family, which has immense wealth, no small part of which resides in the trust. In the past, the affairs of the family, including such discord, has attracted considerable publicity in the media.\\" Then, in a judgement handed down on 7 October 2011, Justice Brereton stated that he intended to dismiss an application by Rinehart, that there be a stay on court action, and that the family be directed into mediation. In December 2011, three justices of the NSW Court of Appeal lifted the suppression orders on the case. However, a stay was granted until 3 February 2012 and extended by the High Court of Australia until 9 March 2012. Rinehart's application for suppression was supported by Ginia Rinehart, but was opposed by Hope, John and Bianca. A subsequent application by Rinehart for a non-publication order on the grounds of fear of personal and family safety was dismissed by the NSW Supreme Court on 2 February 2012. In March 2012, when the suppression order was lifted, it was revealed that Rinehart had delayed the vesting date of the trust, which had prompted the court action by her three older children. Rinehart stood down as trustee during the hearing in October 2013. While Rinehart's lawyers subsequently declared any legal matters closed, John and Bianca's legal representatives proceeded with a trial in the NSW Supreme Court to deal with allegations of misconduct, whereby Rinehart was accused of having \\"unclean hands\\". it appeared likely that the matter would be settled by the court appointing a new trustee.

It is the first of four books in the Melendy family series, introducing the four Melendy children who determine to stop wasting their Saturdays, pool their allowances, and take turns having adventures in pre-World War II New York City. In 2012 The Saturdays was ranked number 75 among all-time best children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal ‚Äì the second of three books by Enright in the top 100. Plot The four Melendy children live with their father, a widowed professor of economics, and Cuffy, their beloved housekeeper, in a brownstone in New York City. There's thirteen-year-old Mona, who has her heart set on becoming an actress; twelve-year-old mischievous Rush, who plays the piano; ten-year-old Miranda \\"Randy\\" who loves to dance and paint; and thoughtful Oliver, who is six. Tired of wasting Saturdays doing nothing but wishing for larger allowances, the four Melendys jump at Randy's idea to start the Independent Saturday Afternoon Adventure Club (I.S.A.A.C.). If they pool their resources and take turns spending the whole amount, they can each have at least one memorable Saturday afternoon of their own. Before long, I.S.A.A.C. is in operation and every Saturday is definitely one to remember. Each Melendy child is able to do exactly what he or she pleases, discovering new ideas along the way. Randy becomes friends with an old lady who was once kidnapped by gypsies, Rush brings home a stray dog, and Mona shocks her family by taking her first step toward adulthood. But when Oliver wants to be out on his own, too, the rest of the family has second thoughts. Reception Kirkus gave The Saturdays a starred review for \\"books of remarkable merit\\", calling it \\"[a] delightful family story, built around an original pattern.\\" Starred review.

Mrs. John Nicholas Brown (Anne Seddon Kinsolving Brown, 1906-1985) began collecting toy soldiers in 1930, but within a few years had moved on to acquiring graphics and monographs depicting or describing military uniforms. In the years following the Second World War, the collection increased dramatically, so much so that the Brown family were advised to move the archive out of their house for fear of causing structural damage from the weight. Today, the collection is located on the top floor of the John Hay Library situated on the Brown University campus. Besides approximately 5,000 toy soldiers (additional figures can be found in the Annmary Brown Memorial on the Brown campus), the main focus of the collection are over 15,000 prints, drawings, paintings and watercolors. There are also photographs and sheet music covers. The graphics depict soldiers in battle, on parade, genre scenes, caricatures, military portraits, and uniform studies. Every major country is represented, with France, the United Kingdom, Germany and the German states being the largest sections. Other important parts focus on Austria, Russia, the United States and elsewhere. Complementing the graphic collection are over 20,000 books, and thousands of albums, sketchbooks, scrapbooks and portfolios. The monographs include army lists, regimental histories, biographies, campaign histories, humor, royalty and ceremonies, costume and early travel, uniform books, drill, tactics and regulation.

Kirchner's tree, like Sp√§th's a level-branched suberose field elm, was received from Belgium in 1864 as Ulmus rugosa pendula. Kirchner stressed that it was different from Loudon's Ulmus montana var. rugosa, being \\"more likely to belong to U. campestris or its subspecies, the Cork-elm\\". Green (1964) considered Ulmus rugosa pendula Kirchner a synonym of U. campestris suberosa pendula. Sp√§th, however, listed U. campestris rugosa and U. campestris suberosa pendula as distinct cultivars in his 1903 catalogue, and distributed them separately. It is not known whether herbarium leaf-specimens from the Wageningen Arboretum originally labelled U procera 'Rugosa' and renamed U. carpinifolia (1962) show Sp√§th's tree. They show, however, a different clone from herbarium specimens labelled Ulmus hollandica Mill. rugosa pendula from Arnold Arboretum (1930) (see 'External links'). Neither Kirchner's nor Sp√§th's suberose 'Rugosa' is to be confused with the cultivar Ulmus montana var. rugosa. Description Kirchner described Ulmus rugosa pendula as having small and glossy leaves, roundish ovoid and very rough, with the main branches spreading horizontally or slightly inclined, and very corky, the side branches being thin, short and hanging. Sp√§th described his U. campestris rugosa Kirchner as a corky field elm with branches standing out horizontally. Pests and diseases Not known. Cultivation No specimens of Kirchner's or Sp√§th's suberose 'Rugosa' are known to survive. One specimen of Sp√§th's U. campestris rugosa was planted in 1898 at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada. Three specimens supplied by the Sp√§th nursery to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as U. campestris rugosa may survive in Edinburgh as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm); the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden per se does not list the plant.

Football career Williams was born in Wallasey, Cheshire, and raised in France. He started his football career in the youth system at Bordeaux, and played for the Bordeaux junior side which won the French under-18 championship. At the age of 18 he came to England with fellow French youngster Tr√©sor Luntala for trials with Birmingham City, and both players signed on free transfers before the 1999‚Äì2000 season. Williams represented England at under-18 level. He made his first-team debut for Birmingham in August 2000, playing once in the League Cup and then three First Division matches, but his development was interrupted by the need for a hernia operation. Though he recovered sufficiently to resume playing reserve team football, scoring the goals which put the team into the semifinal of the Birmingham Senior Cup, a spate of injuries meant that those four games were all he played for Birmingham's first team before being released when his contract expired. He had a trial at Crewe Alexandra, on the recommendation of former assistant manager Brian Eastick, then Academy Director at Birmingham, but no contract ensued. He joined Conference side Scarborough for the 2003‚Äì04 season, but sustained a broken rib and punctured lung in only his second game, complications from which meant a prolonged stay in hospital and three months out of football. Returning in November 2003, he played a further ten league games, but was only an unused substitute in the club's FA Cup fourth round match against Premier League club Chelsea, despite scoring and hitting the post in the preceding league game. He then injured an ankle, and was released at the end of the season. He spent the 2005‚Äì06 season with Belgian Second Division club Excelsior Virton for whom he made three substitute appearances. In August 2006 he had a trial with Brighton & Hove Albion, scoring a goal in an 11‚Äì0 rout of French amateur side Racing Club Port du Havre, and making a promising substitute appearance in a 2‚Äì0 defeat against Le Havre AC, but manager Mark McGhee decided against signing him.

Builder's tea, also known as a builder‚Äôs brew, is a British English colloquial term for a strong cup of tea. It takes its name from the inexpensive tea commonly drunk by labourers taking a break. A builder's tea is typically brewed in a mug with the tea contained in a teabag (as opposed to loose leaves in a teapot), with a small amount of milk added after either stirring the tea or leaving it to stand and infuse. It is often taken with one or more teaspoons of white sugar, but this is optional. Characteristics Builder's tea is typically robust and has a rich, dark beige colour. The name was chosen because workers in the British building trade typically drink many cups of tea during their working day. The term has widespread use throughout both Great Britain and Ireland. Research from the Social Issues Research Centre found that people performing construction work found tea \\"both soothing and stimulating\\". A 2013 article in the Daily Express noted that construction workers are drinking less builder's tea than ever before, preferring to drink coffee varieties such as cappuccinos and lattes, as well as soft drinks.

The company was founded in April 2009 after the merger of the William Morris Agency and the Endeavor Agency. Endeavor represents artists in movies, television, music, theatre, digital media, and publishing. It also represents the NFL and NHL. Endeavor also leads a group which owns the Ultimate Fighting Championship and owns Miss Universe. It is headed by CEO Ari Emanuel and executive chairman Patrick Whitesell. History =Beginnings= The Endeavor Talent Agency launched in 1995. By 2009, it was one of the fastest-growing Hollywood talent agencies, with The New York Times singling out its reputation for \\"quick thinking, ferocity and barely bridled ambition\\". =William Morris Endeavor= On April 27, 2009, WMA and the Endeavor Talent Agency announced that they were forming William Morris Endeavor, or WME. Endeavor executives Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell were widely seen as the architects of the merger and quickly became the Co-CEOs of WME. Following the official announcement of the merger, nearly 100 WMA employees and former board members were let go. One of those leaving was Jim Wiatt, who came to WMA in 1999 from International Creative Management, where he was Vice-Chairman. He had joined WMA as president and co-chief executive officers, and had risen to board Chairman. Following the merger, WME moved its headquarters into the offices of Endeavor at 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in the heart of Beverly Hills. In 2011, Emanuel was quoted in a Financial Times profile about the company saying, \\"We built a culture where people are rewarded for taking risks.\\" Emanuel and Whitesell implemented several leadership strategies to boost the productivity of their agents, most notably, the \\"Farmhouse\\" training program. = Expansion= Endeavor grew to include several subsidiary companies and expanded divisions. Fortune named co-CEOs Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell to their 2010 \\"Businessperson of the Year\\" list, acknowledging their corporate growth strategies. Emanuel had previously been recognized as a 21st-century \\"super agent\\" by both The Wall Street Journal and The Guardian, as well as an Advertising Age \\"Influencer.\\" In July 2011, the company and its foundation created Camp Summer Eagle, which provides donations and activities for schoolchildren at Foster Elementary in Compton, California. Shortly after the merger, WME helped launch the investment group Raine, which aligned the company with properties like Vice Media and Zumba Fitness. In 2010, WME partnered with RED Interactive, a digital advertising agency. Two years later, they formed an alliance with the social media management firm TheAudience, partnering with digital entrepreneur Sean Parker and executing social campaigns for properties like the Seth MacFarlane motion picture Ted and the Coachella Music Festival. 2013 brought a strategic partnership between WME and creative music agency Jingle Punks, which creates, publishes and licenses music. WME is also an investor in the e-commerce platform [OpenSky], which was named one of America's \\"Most Promising Companies\\" by Forbes. In 2013, Whitesell and Emanuel were profiled in Fast Company, highlighting the company's digital growth. On May 2, 2012, WME and Silver Lake, a technology- focused private equity firm based in Silicon Valley, signed an agreement for Silver Lake to acquire a 31% minority stake in the agency. A new executive committee, consisting of Co-CEOs Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell and Silver Lake Partners Managing Director Egon Durban, leads the company's growth strategy and investment activities. In July 2013, WME acquired a minority stake in the creative agency Droga5. The partnership combines the companies‚Äô advertising and entertainment resources. =WME-IMG= On December 18, 2013, WME and Silver Lake announced the acquisition of IMG for $2.4 billion. WME‚Äôs Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell took over as co-CEOs. On January 21, 2015, it was announced that WME had acquired Global eSports Management (GEM), an international agency representing various esports and professional video game players and personalities. In April 2015 they bought Professional Bull Riders On September 23, 2015 it was announced that WME/IMG would be partnering with Turner Broadcasting to create a televised esports league, the ELeague. On September 14, 2015, WME acquired from Donald Trump the Miss Universe Organization, which produces the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants and related content. The organization sells television rights to the pageants in other countries. Financial details were not disclosed. Softbank and Fidelity Investments in early 2016 invested in WME-IMG. The company formed a joint venture in June 2016 for China with Sequoia Capital, Tencent and Fountainvest Partners. On July 9, 2016, Zuffa, LLC, the parent company of Ultimate Fighting Championship, was sold to a group led by WME-IMG, its owner Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and MSD Capital, for $4.025 billion, the largest-ever acquisition in the sports industry. On August 22, 2016, WME acquired the literary agency Rabineau Wachter Sanford & Gillett (RWSG); its co-founders, Sylvie Rabineau and Jill Holwager Gillett, head a division of WME involved in the coordination of screen adaptations of literature. WME/IMG purchased in August 2017 a majority stake in Bloom, a film finance and sales company lead by Ken Kao and Alex Walton. =Endeavor= WME- IMG reorganized in October 2017 with the parent company being renamed from WME-IMG to Endeavor. Ari Emanuel became Endeavor CEO and Patrick Whitesell became Endeavor executive chairman. The general talent agency retained the WME name as the sports agency retained the IMG name. In October 2017, Endeavor Content was formed from the WME's and IMG's film financing and scripted TV sales units, WME's advisory group for film financiers and content producers and Bloom, which will continue to operate autonomously. Appointed as co- presidents of Endeavor Content were Graham Taylor and Chris Rice with additional hires of Negeen Yazdi as senior vice president of film and Joe Hipps as senior vice president of television. On November 15, 2017, actor Terry Crews stated on Good Morning America that Adam Venit, head of WME's motion picture department, had squeezed Crews' genitals with his hand at an industry party in February 2016. WME responded they had suspended Venit following an internal investigation, on November 27, 2017 it was announced Venit would return to work after a month's unpaid leave. On December 4, 2017 lawyers acting on behalf of Terry Crews filed suit against WME and Venit stating \\"It is now time to hold Venit accountable for his sexual predatory behavior and to hold WME accountable for its conduct in condoning, ratifying, and encouraging Venit's sexual predatory behavior\\". Third Coast Content, a faith and family audiences production and publishing company, was founded in February 2018 by veteran film executive Ben Howard as CEO with Endeavor Content as an investor and as its provider of sales and advisory services. In April 2019, Droga5 was acquired by Accenture.  Filing Initial public offering (IPO)  On May 24, 2019 Endeavor Group (EDR) filed the initial public offering (IPO) paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission that would have valued the company at $7.6 billion. The form detailed Endeavor's revenue was $3.61 billion in 2018 with a net income of $100.1 million after adjustments, and potential risks involved of being potentially sued (1) ‚Äúover alleged long-term neurocognitive impairment arising from concussions‚Äù, (2) collective bargaining to unionize the MMA athletes and (3) \\"five related class-action lawsuits filed against it alleging that UFC violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 by monopolizing the alleged market for elite professional MMA athletes‚Äô services\\". On September 26, 2019, Endeavor Group announced it cancelled its planned IPO that was set for September 27. Endeavor Group said in a statement \\"Endeavor will continue to evaluate the timing for the proposed offering as market conditions develop\\". The Wall Street Journal reported the under performance of the recent IPO for Peloton was a contributing factor. As is an ongoing lawsuit with several former UFC fighters.

Personal life In 1734, Susanna was married to John Adams Sr. (1691‚Äì1761). She is among the least well known of the famous Adams family, for her name appears infrequently in the large body of Adams writings. Historian David McCullough notes that no writings of hers survive, though it is known that others would often read to her, suggesting that she might have been illiterate. However, in his memoirs, John Adams himself wrote that \\"as my parents were both fond of reading...I was very early taught to read at home,\\" indicating that his mother likely possessed at least a basic level of literacy.Autobiography of John Adams, \\"Parents and schooling,\\" p. 2.

Role on the show He was an unseen character at first, and even then very rarely referred to. When Harry expressed that he was upset about not serving any useful purpose in the mission, the family revealed to him that he was modified to serve as the transmitter that relayed messages from the Big Giant Head, from which point the character then \\"spoke\\" through Harry. He apparently got his job by \\"outrunning the fireball\\". Though the Solomons are subordinate to the Big Giant Head, they sometimes express dissatisfaction with his leadership, with Dick declaring at one point that he only got the job because he \\"kissed the Big Giant Butt.\\" When the character did eventually appear on screen, he was portrayed (in human form) by William Shatner, and did very little apart from wreak havoc on the Solomons' lives. He insisted on being waited on hand and foot, and frequently interrupted Dick's physics classes, posing as an associate of the Solomons under the pseudonym \\"Stone Phillips\\" (Mrs. Dubcek asked him if it was \\"Like the guy from Dateline\\", to which \\"Stone\\" answered, \\"No\\"). He eventually confessed to being Dick's father, at which point, Harry stated that if Dick was going to take over The Big Giant Head, his name would be Dick Head. Relationship with Vicki After landing on the Earth, Stone (the Big Giant Head) knew very little about women. He was very rude towards them, he decided to go along with Tommy to his Junior Prom, where he met Vicki Dubcek, who was trying to hook up, since she never had her junior prom. Vicki was also trying to get pregnant with Harry's child but they just had a break-up. After \\"Stone\\" beamed her up to his \\"bachelor pod\\" for the night, Vicki declared the next day that she was pregnant by him. Stone left immediately, and about 2 hours later Vicki delivered his baby, whom she named Eric Travis (\\"E.T.\\"). After Stone left, Vicki called a news reporter, saying that she was the mother of a new species. The reporter showed up, but didn't believe her story, because the baby looked like a normal human being. Stone later returned, after he decided that he wanted to take his son back to his home planet but Vicki refused. Stone decided that they had to make up with Vicki in order to become a family. Unfortunately Harry still had feelings for Vicki, and was also trying to win her back. However, at the ending of the episode Harry decided that, since she had a baby with Stone, she was better off becoming a family with Stone. Stone told Vicki that he and the Solomons were aliens and the two went off to the galaxy. They returned to Earth together one last time, at which point it was revealed that Vicki still had feelings for Harry, and thought she made the wrong choice when she left Earth with Stone, because she found their marriage boring.

I saw something on the wing of the plane\\", to which Dick responded \\"The same thing happened to me!\\" This is a double reference. In an early episode, Dick attempts to fly for the first time and is frightened when he sees something on the wing of the plane. Both references are also to the Twilight Zone story \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\", which tells of a man on a commercial flight who is convinced he sees a creature on the plane's wing which no one else can see. Both William Shatner and John Lithgow (Dick) had previously played that Twilight Zone character; Shatner played it in the original 1963 TV series episode, and Lithgow played it in the 1983 movie remake.

A successor to the Cassette Vision, it competed with Nintendo's Family Computer and Sega's SG-1000 line in Japan. History Epoch's original Cassette Vision was introduced in Japan by Epoch in 1981, which had steady sales and took over 70% of the Japanese home console market at the time, with around 400,000 units sold. However, the introduction of next-generation systems from Nintendo, Casio and Sega quickly pushed back the original Cassette Vision, leading Epoch to quickly develop a successor. The Super Cassette Vision was released in 1984, featuring an 8-bit processor and better performance more in line with its competitors. It was later released in France by ITMC under the Yeno branding. At least 16 games were brought over from Japan for a European release. A version of the system targeted the young female market, the Super Lady Cassette Vision. The console came packed in a pink carrying case, alongside the game Milky Princess. The system did not take off, and was unable to match the massive popularity of the Nintendo Famicom, leading Epoch to drop out of the console market by 1987.

Residences are designated as special types, S1 and S2, having altogether 35 different unit variations ‚Äì with dissimilar combinations of features such as extended bays, balconies, bay windows and planter areas. In addition, a viewing gallery on the 52nd storey provides for special events and VIP state visitors. On 8 August 2010, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong delivered his annual National Day message from the gallery. Owing to the sky gardens' popularity as an elevated viewing location for National Day firework displays on 9 August, entry for the day may be publicly balloted. Pinnacle@Duxton was conferred the 2010 Best Tall Building (Asia and Australasia) award by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, as well as the 2011 Urban Land Institute's Global Awards for Excellence. The development has been featured in numerous local and foreign documentaries, including Discovery Channel's \\"How we invented the World: Skyscrapers\\" History The Tanjong Pagar Housing Estate with the Pinnacle@Duxton in the background The Duxton Plain site is historically significant as the site of the first two ten-storey HDB blocks in the Tanjong Pagar area and amongst the oldest built by the HDB in the country.Update on the Duxton Plain Housing Development, Housing and Development Board, 5 December 2003 Redevelopment of Duxton Plain was initiated by Singapore's founding Prime Minister, former Minister Mentor and Tanjong Pagar's Member of Parliament for 60 years, Lee Kuan Yew in August 2001.Âª∫50Â±ÇÊë©Â§©ÁªÑÂ±ãÔºü, Lianhe Zaobao, 26 April 2004 to commemorate the historical significance of the previous blocks. Design An international architectural design competition was conducted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority on behalf of the Ministry of National Development between 8 August 2001 and 21 September 2001.Duxton Plain Public Housing International Architectural Design Competition, Urban Redevelopment Authority The following features were required for entry into the competition: *Accommodation of the adjacent Community Club, which was built by the People's Association in 1960 as part of the first batch of community centres, so that it formed part of the housing community. *Landscaping strategies that seamlessly extended the adjacent Duxton Plain Park horizontally and vertically into the development by incorporating rooftop and high-level sky gardens. *Environmental appropriateness and ability to create a strong sense of ownership. The mature trees around the perimeter of the site, and the jambu ayer and nutmeg trees planted by MM Lee in November 1984 and 1989, were also required to be retained and integrated into the landscaped areas. *Re-siting of plaques commemorating the laying of the foundation stone on 15 March 1963 and the opening ceremony on 10 April 1964 by the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. *As a form of subsidised housing, the proposals had to be cost-effective. To maximise innovation, the design brief and technical requirements were kept to a minimum, with mainly the mandatory requirements specified. =Winning design= The competition was keenly contested with 202 entries submitted by design agencies around the world. It was eventually won by two Singapore architecture companies, ARC Studio Architecture + Urbanism, in collaboration with RSP Architects Planners & Engineers (Pte) Ltd. The HDB expressed concern about several features of the original design:The Pinnacle's architect on top of the world, The Straits Times, 4 July 2004 *Boulevards of trees along its skybridges (fear of falling branches). *Glass panels instead of steel railings for unimpeded views (some people might faint). *Publicly accessible skybridges linking its seven tower blocks (security threats to residents). Some features were modified; notably, the addition of an elevated observation and event room on the 52nd floor of tower 1C, likely to cater for visiting VIPs. HDB set stringent standards for the construction, the design and finishes required for the tender veered towards private housing standards. Units at The Pinnacle@Duxton were also more fully furnished than the average HDB project. The design exceeded standards of private condominiums so much that it caused concern amongst private developers regarding their future if public housing was developed in a similar manner.Too stylo, complain condo developers, The New Paper, 2 June 2004HDB's Pinnacle: A threat to private developers?, The Straits Times, 19 June 2004 The HDB had to reassure them that this project was a one-off special residential development.3,000 apply for 528 units, The New Paper, 14 June 2004 The Pinnacle@Duxton received much publicity in the media when it was launched in May 2004.

Prior to that, dietary issues were limited to under and malnutrition, which is still a problem in various parts of the country. Following trends already ongoing in other parts of the world, Mexicans have been foregoing traditional whole grains and vegetables in favor of a diet with more animal products and processed foods. It has seen dietary energy intake and rates of overweight and obese people rise with seven out of ten at least overweight and a third clinically obese. History =Undernutrition vs. overnutrition= Until the late 20th century, dietary issues in Mexico were solely a question of undernutrition or malnutrition, generally because of poverty and distribution issues. For this reason, obesity was associated with wealth and health, the latter especially in children.The nutrition transition and obesity: Food and Agricultural Order of the United Nations.Sobrepeso y obesidad, Gobierno Del Distrito Federal, April 2013, http://www.who.int/topics/obesity/en/index.html. Despite changes in the Mexican diet and food distribution, malnutrition still remains problematic in various parts of the country.\\"Fat Mexico - Obesity on the rise in Mexico\\", The Economist. =Nutrition transition= By the 1980s, Latin American populations began to experience widespread changes in their diet, away from produce and grains toward processed food in a manner similar to what had previously occurred in developed countries. The main reason for this shift is the dominance of transnational food companies in the Mexican market, following a trend seen in other parts of the world. This shift was toward the consumption of high-energy -sugar, -fat, and -salt food featuring various types of sweeteners and animal products and a decrease in whole grains and vegetables. Animal proteins replaced vegetable, with a 50% increase in prevalence from the 1960s to the 1990s. The total cholesterol availability in Mexico surpasses the US guidelines for daily intake, at over 300 mg per day, a result of the increased availability of saturated fats. The change was initially limited to more affluent urban groups that could afford processed foods and these groups showed an increase in health conditions associated with this diet, including obesity. These foods are easier and less time-consuming to prepare. With easier access to fast food and supermarkets, more affluent households also tend to buy more meat and less oils and grains, while poorer urban households tend to choose foods that exceed their energy needs and lack essential vitamins and minerals. In a survey of 650 urban school lunches, none were graded as healthy and only one percent graded as adequate. Since the 1980s, rural diets, that had consisted primarily of vegetables and very little animal or saturated fats, have shown declines in fruit and vegetable intake. In Northern Mexico, rural populations who transitioned from their traditional diets to more processed diets also experienced a dramatic increase in obesity and diabetes. In addition to dietary changes, modern life has also made the Mexican population more sedentary. Traditional labor-intensive jobs in farming, factories and mining have given way to desk jobs. In addition, most people use motorized transportation instead of walking or biking. About 40% of Mexicans do not exercise. = Socioeconomic factors of obesity = Since the 1980s, many studies have been carried out intending to identify the one nutrient, food, or beverage that leads to weight gain and obesity. Sugar, fat, fast food, soft drinks, and the list goes on - all of them were suspect of being the reason for the worldwide increasing overweight and obesity rates and yet none of them could essentially be made responsible. However, the studies did prove that \\"each of [the examined dietary elements ] is associated with either obesity or weight gain\\" (Drewnowski, 2007). Furthermore, these elements have one characteristic in common which is their relative inexpensiveness (as opposed to fruits, vegetables, fresh juice etc.) and also, they are preferably bought by lower-income consumers (Drewnowski). A review of studies (Dinsa et al.) analyzing the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and obesity among men, women, and children in developing countries found that in upper- middle-income countries like Mexico (Mexico is categorized as upper middle income (The World Bank) and middle HDI (UNDP)) obesity is highly prevalent. Middle-income and medium HDI countries showed a negative association between SES and obesity among women, i.e. the prevalence of obesity rises with decreasing income. The negative association becomes even clearer in countries growing into the high-income category. Among men, results have been mixed and the studies on children all revealed a positive association between SES and obesity. First, an explanation for the positive association among children could be a shift in free time activity based on their family's affluence, e.g. children of more affluent families are more likely to have access to and probably spend more time with playing video games whereas children of less affluent families cannot afford such luxury goods and predominantly stick to more active free time activities and therefore have a higher energy expenditure that compensates for their energy intake. Second, the negative association among middle-income women in consideration of the above-mentioned expensiveness of most healthy products raises the question of whether the easier access to unhealthy, energy-dense and less expensive food is the crucial point to explain the high prevalence of obesity in Mexico (Dinsa et al.). What Drewnowski describes as the \\"economics of food choice\\" is the fact that people have to manage their often scarce resources in a way that all basic expenditures (food, housing, clothing, school fees) are covered. Consequently, the kind of food people consume also, or primarily, depends on food prices (Dinsa et al., Drewnowski, Lozada et al.). While energy-dense products, rich in sugar and fats, cost less in relation to the energy they provide, low-energy healthy food like fruits and vegetables is more expensive in this respect (Drewnowski, 166). Furthermore, fruits and vegetables are now twice as expensive than 20 years ago whereas the costs of added sugar and fats did not change (Drewnowski, 162). To sum up, \\"foods, beverages, snacks, or diets said to promote obesity [are], in every case, inexpensive. In contrast, more costly dietary patterns [are] associated with leanness, weight maintenance, or greater weight loss\\" (Drewnoski, 166). In conclusion, low- income can be seen as an obstacle to a healthier diet as the consumption of \\"good\\" products may wear out the available budget. Another aspect that deserves attention is that people of lower SES usually live in less secure neighborhoods where walking around might present a danger. In addition, these places, in general, do not show a lot of establishments that offer healthy food. As a study conducted in New York found, the \\"walkability\\" of one's neighborhood and the lack of availability of healthy food establishments are also predictors of obesity (Mu√±ez Oliveira, 23). Finally, although today Mexico shows a lower level of undernourishment, many of the now young adults used to suffer from nutritional stunting in early life, which is also considered to increase the risk of becoming overweight or obese later in life (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). All in all, the socioeconomic factor as a determinant for food choice, living conditions, and possible indicators of past undernourishment has been proved to be a predictor of obesity and weight gain. Therefore, future policies countering obesity should aim at increasing the accessibility of healthy food alternatives for the less affluent population, e.g. by subsidizing fruits, vegetables, and fiber-rich whole grains. However, the creation of consciousness about the importance of healthy eating and physical activity among the population, and particularly among children, remains an essential measure as well. =Rates of obesity and consequences= After the widespread introduction of processed foods, obesity rates began to rise in the country. As of 2000, individual dietary energy intake has been speculated to be approximately per day, 30% more than in 1962. A 1999 survey found 24% of Mexican women were obese and an additional 35% were overweight; 55% men were either obese or overweight. In a survey conducted by National Health Survey in 2000, it was found that the prevalence of obesity in the sample population was 67% in women and 61% in men. A similar survey in 2003 targeting obesity from rural, low-income communities showed that around 60% of women and 50% of men were considered either overweight or obese with respect to the Body Mass Index. By 2010, seven out of ten Mexicans were overweight with a third clinically obese. Mexico ranks the most obese country in the world in adult obesity (as of 2013), and first for childhood obesity with about 4.5 million children diagnosed as such. Mexico passed the United States as the most obese country in the world. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is 16.7% in preschool children, 26.2% in school children, and 30.9% in adolescents. For adults, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is 39.7 and 29.9%, respectively. Since the 1990s, fat has become the principal source of energy in the Mexican diet and it is assumed that the consumption of highly processed food will continue increasing. As a consequence, Mexico has seen the same kind of health issues that have affected other countries with overweight populations. Standardized mortality rates (SMR) for diabetes, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and hypertension have increased dramatically. As of 2012, diabetes - associated with obesity - was the largest single killer of Mexicans. As of 2016, it was responsible for over 100,000 premature deaths in the country. Economically, the rising obesity rate in Mexico is also taking a toll on its health care system. According to a study published by Cambridge University Press, cost of treatment for obesity related diseases is projected to grow from an estimated $806 million in 2010 to $1.2 billion in 2030 and $1.7 billion in 2050. Recent efforts have been made by the Mexican government to address the issue of obesity as a reduction of 1% in mean BMI would reduce the cost by $43 million in 2030 and $85 million in 2050 respectively. Through initiatives that focus on the narrative of a healthier lifestyle, the government aims to reduce the projected obesity prevalence. However, not much is known about the effectiveness of those programs. Efforts to combat the problem There have been efforts to combat obesity in the country, with the federal government investing about seven percent of its budget to various nutritional programs. Both public and private money has been spent on various campaigns aimed at modern eating habits. Mexico‚Äôs government has created nutrition programs, to deal with nutritional issues such as obesity; especially in vulnerable people and low-income sectors. These include food distribution among low-income communities, micronutrient supplementation, and fortification of food. All of this is made to fight the deficiency of vitamins and minerals. Some programs, as the distribution ones, try to achieve the objective by dispensing food coupons on marginalized communities. One of these initiatives is implemented by the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS). This program is known as \\"Preven-IMSS\\" (Prevent-IMSS). It integrates nutritional and physical activities as components, to combat diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. Another government initiative is with Mexico‚Äôs Health Ministry called \\"Oportunidades\\" (Opportunities) and \\"Liconsa\\". Opportunidades has the aim to support low-income and extremely poor families with health services and food. This is reached by offering nutrition education with which families can develop their capacities to sustenance health and nutrition care. In 2008, the Mexican Secretariat of Health and PepsiCo launched a health campaign for children. The program is aimed at elementary school-age children and encourages active participation in exercise activities and adopting a healthy lifestyle by using a computer game.

This new ball is aimed at promoting the sport in children and reducing childhood obesity. Decio de Maria Serrano, the president of the Mexican soccer federation, said: \\"We are excited with this new campaign.

Congress's lower house of Congress passed a special tax on junk food that is seen as potentially the broadest of its kind, part of an ambitious Mexican government effort to contain runaway rates of obesity and diabetes. The House passed the proposed measure to charge a 5% tax on packaged food that contains or more per 100 grams, on grounds that such high-energy items typically contain large amounts of salt and sugar and few essential nutrients.Mexico Tries Taxes to Combat Obesity, https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304864504579141462546165166 Subsequent studies have indicated that the one peso per liter tax rate has only led to a small reduction in soft drink consumption, and the fall in calorie consumption was described as \\"nothing compared to the drop in calories people needed to consume in order to not be obese\\". The effectiveness of the tax on junk food was subject to debate.

The state of Tennessee chartered the railroad on May 24, 1866. The original plans were to build a line from Knoxville eastward through Lebanon, Nashville, and Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi, where it would interconnect with westward- leading railroads to the Pacific Coast. Hauling coal from the nearby Cumberland Mountains to western markets was an important intended source of operation income, as well as from passenger service and produce and freight hauls. Among the early investors and executives was former Confederate general George Maney, who would serve for nine years as the president of the Tennessee & Pacific, starting in 1868 when he succeeded the late James D. B. DeBow, the well known publisher of DeBow's Review. Plagued by difficulties in raising enough financing, the company finally began construction in June 1869 of the 29-mile line between Lebanon and Nashville. Funds were generated to commission the Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works to manufacture two 4-4-0 locomotives for the new T&P;, which were delivered in 1870. These were named the \\"Wilson County\\" and the \\"J.D.B. DeBow.\\"Prince, p. 28. The segment opened in September 1871 in time to convey passengers to the Wilson County Fair. Headquartered in Lebanon, the fledgling railroad erected a sprawling Victorian-style passenger and freight station, combined with the general offices. Major cargo from local farmers included lumber, butter, flour, and other agricultural products which were shipped to markets in Nashville, where another station house was erected in 1872. However, the financial problems resurfaced and management could not repay the railroad company's debts. In 1877, the state revoked the charter and seized the Tennessee & Pacific. The company and its assets were sold on March 1 to the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. The T&P; stayed in operation under its old name until 1888, when it became the NC&StL; Lebanon Branch. Passenger service continued on the old line until 1935, when the last train departed Lebanon.Trainnet.org: Tennessee & Pacific Railroad References * Prince, Richard E., Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway: History and Steam Locomotives.

He was the first actor to play Brother Cadfael for BBC radio.  Early life  Smith was born in Trealaw in the Rhondda Valley, and lived his early years on Ynyscynon Road, but lived for most of his adult life in Dinas Powys. He became interested in acting while he was at school, and was determined not to become a miner like his father, who had been killed in a pit accident when Smith was only three years old. After leaving school Smith became a builder's labourer. Following national service in the army, he began acting professionally at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Cardiff, then joined the Swansea Grand Theatre as an assistant stage manager. He later moved to London, where he spent a year unemployed before he landed a part in a play about the Hungarian uprising.  Television career  Smith made his television debut in Shadows of Heroes in 1959, and then his appearances in series such as Z-Cars and A Family at War made him known to the public. He also appeared as Detective Inspector Percy Firbank in Public Eye, a role he started playing in 1971. Two years later came one of his most famous roles, as George Barraclough in Sam, one of Granada Television's drama series set in northern England.  Later years  Ray Smith died at the age of 55 in the lounge of Llandough Hospital after a major heart attack. He had been shooting one of his last scenes in the television adaptation of Kingsley Amis's novel The Old Devils when he was taken ill on location in Newport. An onscreen credit dedicated the series The Old Devils to his memory, and his performance in it won him a posthumous BAFTA Cymru Award (Best Actor) in 1993. His son was the musician Huw Justin Smith, better known as Pepsi Tate.

Tornado The Tornado was a wooden roller coaster built and designed by John C. Allen and the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. The coaster was built in 1961, and enlarged from its original 58 feet tall to 75 feet tall for the 1962 season. After 1962, the lift hill led directly into a turn before the first drop, and a new high turn was added at the station end, with the rest of the ride maintaining its pre-expansion configuration RCDB Tornado (Wedgewood Village) The trains are now operating at Stricker's Grove in Ohio on a roller coaster also called The Tornado. Maurice Woods died in July 2008. He was working on a coffee table Wedgewood Book at the time. The olympic regulation size pool is still in existence and the Wedgewood Apartments have now been built around it.

Biography George started her artistic career on the stage, where she befriended Jean Cocteau, but gravitated especially toward a repertoire of old songs with realist themes. Paul Franck, director of the Paris Olympia, discovered George in the 1920s in a Brussels cabaret. George debuted at the Olympia in 1922, singer her famous Nous irons √† Valparaiso (We will go to Valparaiso) and Good bye Farewell. A certain high-minded section of the public did not appreciate the refrain of this song; George already achieved a polemical success, criticised by this section of the public which would be hostile to her intellectualism and emancipation throughout her career. Yvonne George moved into a ground-floor apartment in Neuilly with desirable decor, where she received many artists and men of letters. In 1924, well known in Parisian intellectual circles as a charming singer, George became the subject of a passionate love affair with the French poet Robert Desnos, who wrote her numerous poems including the famous J'ai tant r√™v√© de toi (I have dreamed so much about you). Desnos initiated her into taking opium. It was in this period that Desnos also wrote his novel La Libert√© ou l'Amour (Freedom or Love), a work which would be condemned for obscenity by the tribunal de la Seine. George's performance style is considered as embodying the principles of the French realist song. She left a very small posterity to the public at large. Her musical repertoire contained some 200 songs, but she recorded very few. 21 recordings were made, of which only 16 survive, some of which are repeats of each other. The themes of the songs, however, and her manner of interpretation with a troubled, broken voice, were to influence other singing and speaking performers such as the French singer Barbara. Yvonne George participated in the progress of female emancipation in the inter-war period. Weakened by the excesses of her lifestyle and especially her drug habits, George fell ill with tuberculosis. Following ineffective treatments, she died in a hotel room near the port of Genoa on 22 April 1930, aged 33.

Built in 1973 as the ferry MV Gustav Vasa for service between Malm√∂ (Sweden) and Travem√ºnde (Germany), she later operated as the MV Norr√∂na providing a ferry service to the Faroe Islands. As the fourth ship operated by the organisation, The MV Logos Hope follows in the line of MV Logos, the wrecked hulk of which now sits on a rock shelf on the Chilean coast, MV Logos II which was retired in the fall of 2008 and which Logos Hope was designed to replace, and MV Doulos which was sold to a company in Singapore in 2009. Twice as big as any previous ship operated by the organisation, the ship was completely refitted over a period of 5 years. Logos Hope provides a better quality of life for crew as well as a wider range of activities for visitors and guests. The newly created Logos Hope Experience (which is situated on a deck that was installed into the original ferry‚Äôs car area) holds up to 800 visitors at any time, with capacity to host an additional 500 in the Hope Theatre and Logos Lounge. This publicly accessible deck offers visitors an introduction to the vessel and the organisation, a book fair featuring over 5,000 titles of educational and Christian books, a visual presentation called the Journey of Life, which is based on the story of the \\"Prodigal Son\\", and the International Cafe. The crew and staff of 400 people are from over 60 countries. Unlike the crew during her original use as a car ferry, crew and staff normally join the organisation to live on board for two years as volunteers. Schedule Logos Hope generally visits ports for two weeks and is continually sailing from port to port year round. Since the launch into active service in February 2009, she has been in several regions: Northern Europe, the Caribbean, West Africa, the Mediterranean, the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia, and most recently Latin America. History In 1973 the ship was commissioned as the car ferry Gustav Vasa running between Malm√∂ (Sweden) and Travem√ºnde (Germany), a route she ran for 10 years. In April 1983 she was sold to the Faroese ferry company Smyril Line and renamed Norr√∂na. Sailing from T√≥rshavn, the Faroese capital, to Lerwick (Shetland Islands), Bergen (Norway), Hanstholm (Denmark) and Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur (Iceland) each summer, she was often chartered in the winter to cover other operators‚Äô overhaul schedules. When Smyril Line delivered a new Norr√∂na in 2003, the old vessel became Norr√∂na I and was put up for sale. The current owners purchased the vessel in March 2004.

The EME is organized by Skora's company, Global Games Group, and it usually takes place in capital cities and other important metropolises in different countries around the world, with their racecourses often located in their busiest areas.tagesspiegel.de Der Tagesspiegel The first competition took place in Berlin, Germany on September 1, 2007. Twenty people participated and walked through popular areas of the city, such as the Olympic Stadium, the Tiergarten, the Brandenburger Tor and Potsdamer Platz. The winner of the competition was Mark Peus, a pilot for Lufthansa, who walked non stop for 36 hours. The fourth competition took place on November 30, 2007 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 50 contestants started the race in front of the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti soccer stadium and walked day and night through downtown Buenos Aires. As the days went by and fewer people kept walking, the event became a media sensation and by its third day the remaining competitors had become instant celebrities. People would ask them for autographs, take pictures with them or show support from balconies and cars. By its fourth day, the EME was featured on the cover of Clarin, Argentina's biggest selling newspaper. After 102 hours of walking, only two contestants were left. Marcelo Muzyka and Ivan Lamas were walking side by side, and were willing to keep going for as long as their legs could move. After careful consideration, the organization decided their sacrifice had been important enough and declared a technical tie.

Since version 0.31 Mausezahn is open source in terms of the GPLv2. Herbert Haas, the original developer of Mausezahn, died on 25 June 2011. The project has been incorporated into the netsniff-ng toolkit, and continues to be developed there. Typical applications of Mausezahn include: * Testing or stressing IP multicast networks * Penetration testing of firewalls and IDS * Finding weaknesses in network software or appliances * Creation of malformed packets to verify whether a system processes a given protocol correctly * Didactical demonstrations as lab utility Mausezahn allows sending an arbitrary sequence of bytes directly out of the network interface card. An integrated packet builder provides a simple command line interface for more complicated packets. Since version 0.38, Mausezahn offers a multi-threaded mode with Cisco-style command line interface.  Features  As of version 0.38 Mausezahn supports the following features: * Jitter measurement via Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets * VLAN tagging (arbitrary number of tags) * MPLS label stacks (arbitrary number of labels) * BPDU packets as used by the Spanning Tree Protocol (PVST+ is also supported) * Cisco Discovery Protocol messages * Link Layer Discovery Protocol messages * IGMP version 1 and 2 query and report messages * DNS messages * ARP messages * IP, UDP, and TCP header creation * ICMP packets * Syslog messages * Address, port, and TCP sequence number sweeps * Random MAC or IP addresses, FQDN addresses * A very high packet transmission rate (approximately 100,000 packets per second) Mausezahn only sends exactly the packet the user has specified. Therefore, it is rather less suited for vulnerability audits where additional algorithms are required to detect open ports behind a firewall and to automatically evade intrusion detection systems (IDS).

It is used for the recovery of fine particles of free gold, meaning gold that does not require gold cyanidation for recovery.Knelson Concentrator goldmetallurgy.com, accessed: 2 August 2010 Operation The machines utilise the principles of a centrifuge to enhance the gravitational force experienced by feed particles to effect separation based on particle density. The key components of the unit are a cone shaped \\"concentrate\\" bowl, rotated at high speed by an electric motor and a pressurized water jacket encompassing the bowl. Feed material, typically from a ball mill discharge or cyclone underflow bleed, is fed as a slurry toward the centre of the bowl from above. The feed slurry contacts the base plate of the vessel and, due to its rotation, is thrust outward. The outer extremities of the concentrate bowl house a series of ribs and between each pair of ribs is a groove. During operation the lighter material flows upward over the grooves and heavy mineral particles (usually of economic value) become trapped within them. Pressurized water is injected through a series of tangential water inlets along the perimeter of each groove to maintain a fluidized bed of particles in which heavy mineral particles can be efficiently concentrated. The Knelson concentrator typically operates as a batch process, with lighter gangue material being continuously discharged via overflow and a heavy mineral concentrate periodically removed by flushing the bowl with water.

Light gun shooters revolve around the protagonist shooting targets, either antagonists or inanimate objects. Light gun shooters generally feature action or horror themes and some may employ a humorous, parodic treatment of these conventions. These games typically feature \\"on-rails\\" movement, which gives the player control only over aiming; the protagonist's other movements are determined by the game. Games featuring this device are sometimes termed \\"rail shooters\\", though this term is also applied to games of other genres in which \\"on-rails\\" movement is a feature. Some, particularly later, games give the player greater control over movement and in still others the protagonist does not move at all. Light gun shooters employ \\"light gun\\" controllers, so named because they function through the use of light sensors. Mechanical games using light guns had existed since the 1930s, though they operated differently from those used in video games. Throughout the 1970s mechanical games were replaced by electronic video games and in the 1980s popular light gun shooters such as Duck Hunt emerged. The genre was most popular in the 1990s, subsequent to the release of Virtua Cop, the formula of which was later improved upon by Time Crisis. The genre is less popular in the new millennium, as well as being hampered by compatibility issues, but retains a niche appeal for fans of \\"old school\\" gameplay.  Definition  \\"Light gun shooters\\", \\"light gun games\\" or \\"gun games\\" are games in which the protagonist shoots at targets, whether antagonists or objects, and which use a gun-shaped controller (termed a \\"light gun\\") with which the player aims. While light gun games may feature a first-person perspective, they are distinct from first person shooters, which use more conventional input devices. Light gun games which feature \\"on-rails\\" movement are sometimes termed \\"rail shooters\\", though this term is also applied to other types of shooters featuring similar movement.Hilary, Goldstein, Panzer Dragoon Orta , IGN, Jan 10, 2003, Accessed Mar 1, 2009 The light gun itself is so termed because it functions through the use of a light sensor: pulling the trigger allows it to detect light from the on-screen targets.

Light gun shooters primarily revolve around shooting large numbers of enemies attacking in waves. The protagonist may be required to defend himself by taking cover, or by shooting incoming thrown weapons, such as axes or grenades. The player may also compete against the clock, however, with some games also featuring boss battles. Games may also reward the player for accurate shooting, with extra points, power-ups or secrets. Games which do not pit the player against antagonists instead feature elaborate challenges constructed mainly from inanimate objects, testing the player's speed and accuracy. More conventional games may feature these types of challenges as minigames. Light gun shooters typically feature \\"on-rails\\" movement, which gives the player no control over the direction the protagonist moves in; the player only has control over aiming and shooting.Anderson, Lark, The House of the Dead: Overkill Review , GameSpot, Feb 14, 2009, Accessed Feb 27, 2009 Some games, however, may allow the protagonist to take cover at the push of a button. Other games may eschew on-rails movement altogether and allow the player to move the protagonist freely around the game's environment;Reed, Kristan, Resident Evil Dead Aim, EuroGamer, July 29, 2003, Accessed Feb 27, 2009 still others may feature a static environment.Casamassina, Matt, Controller Concepts: Gun Games , IGN, Sept 26, 2005, Accessed Feb 27, 2009 Light gun shooters use a first person perspective for aiming, though some games may allow the player to switch to a third person perspective in order to maneuver the protagonist.  History  Popular GunCon light guns. The bright orange illustrates the toy-like appearance of most light guns, whereas the grey example appears more realistic. Mechanical gun games existed before the emergence of electronic video games, as far back as the 1920s. The first light guns appeared in the 1930s, with the Seeburg Ray-O- Lite. Games using this toy rifle were mechanical and the rifle fired beams of light at targets wired with sensors.Ashcraft, p. 145 Sega later produced gun games which resemble first-person light gun video games, but were in fact electro-mechanical games that used rear image projection in a manner similar to a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. An early example of this was Duck Hunt, which Sega released in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, printed out the player's score on a ticket, and had sound effects that were volume controllable. Throughout the 1970s, electro- mechanical arcade games were gradually replaced by electronic video games, following the release of Pong in 1972,Ashcraft, p. 134 with 1978's Space Invaders dealing a yet more powerful blow to the popularity of mechanical games.Ashcraft, p. 136 Light guns used in electronic video games work in the opposite manner to their mechanical counterparts: the sensor is in the gun and pulling the trigger allows it to receive light from the on-screen targets. Computer light pens had been used for practical purposes at MIT in the early 1960s,A History of the Internet, Computer History Museum, Accessed Feb 26, 2009 and the Magnavox Odyssey had a light gun accessory,The Ten Greatest Years in Gaming , Edge, June 27, 2006, Accessed Mar 1, 2009 in the production of which Nintendo was involved.Martin Picard, The Foundation of Geemu: A Brief History of Early Japanese video games, International Journal of Computer Game Research, 2013 Light guns became popularly used for video games in the mid-1980s,When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy , GameSpot, Accessed Feb 26, 2009The 30 Defining Moments in Gaming , Edge, Aug 13, 2007, Accessed Feb 27, 2009 with Nintendo's Duck Hunt and Taito's Operation Wolf being popular examples. Sega's Virtua Cop, released in arcades in 1994, broke new ground, popularized the use of 3D polygons in shooter games, and led to a \\"Renaissance\\" in the popularity of arcade gun games. The game was inspired by the Clint Eastwood film Dirty Harry as well as a coffee advertisement in which a can of coffee grew larger in a gun's sights; in Virtua Cop the player had to shoot approaching targets as fast as possible.Ashcraft, pp. 145-46 The acclaimed Time Crisis by Namco, released in Japanese arcades in 1995 and Sony's PlayStation console in 1997, introduced innovations such as simulated recoil and a foot pedal which when pressed caused the protagonist to take cover. The game's light gun controller, the GunCon, was also acclaimed.Ashcraft, p. 147 Namco also released Point Blank for the PlayStation in 1998 (previously available in Japanese arcades as Gun Bullet since 1994), a 2D sprite-based game featuring a unique minigame structure and quirky, humorous tone. The game was critically acclaimed and received two sequels, both for the PlayStation console.Davis, Ryan, Point Blank 3 Review, GameSpot, May 3, 2001, Accessed Mar 1, 2009, Archived from the original on October 10, 2012. Light guns were suppressed for a time in the United States after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and its attendant controversy over video games and gun crime. Since the late 1980s light gun controllers have been generally manufactured to look like toys by painting them in bright colours. In Japan, which lacks the gun crime found in the United States and in which civilians cannot legally own guns, more realistic light guns are widely available. Light gun shooters are less popular in the new millennium than in the 1990s, with new games in the genre seen as \\"old school\\".Rosenberg, Adam & Frushtick, Russel, Best Light-Gun Game - Ghost Squad , UGO, Accessed Mar 1, 2009 The Time Crisis and House of the Dead franchises continued to receive acclaimed installments, with the arcade machine for the latter's House of the Dead 4 Special (2006) featuring large screens enclosing the player, as well as swivelling, vibrating chairs.Ashcraft, pp. 147-48 Some games attempted to incorporate elements of first person shooter or survival horror games through the use of less restricted character movement and exploration, with varying degrees of success.Remo, Chris, Time Crisis 4 Review , Shack News, Nov 21st 2007, Accessed Mar 29, 2008 Others, however, unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay, even embracing a somewhat parodic style. Light guns are not compatible with modern high-definition televisions, leading developers to experiment with hybrid controllers, particularly with the Wii Remote for the Wii, as well as the PlayStation 3's GunCon 3 peripheral used with Time Crisis 4. Others have used the PlayStation Move motion control system.

DVHs are most commonly used as a plan evaluation tool and to compare doses from different plans or to structures. DVHs were introduced by Michael Goitein (who introduced radiation therapy concepts such as the \\"beam's-eye-view,\\" \\"digitally reconstructed radiograph,\\" and uncertainty/error in planning and positioning, among others) and Verhey in 1979. DVH summarizes 3D dose distributions in a graphical 2D format. In modern radiation therapy, 3D dose distributions are typically created in a computerized treatment planning system (TPS) based on a 3D reconstruction of a CT scan. The \\"volume\\" referred to in DVH analysis is a target of radiation treatment, a healthy organ nearby a target, or an arbitrary structure. Types DVHs can be visualized in either of two ways: differential DVHs or cumulative DVHs. A DVH is created by first determining the size of the dose bins of the histogram. Bins can be of arbitrary size, e.g. 0‚Äì1 Gy, 1.001‚Äì2.000 Gy, 2.001‚Äì3.000 Gy, etc. In a differential DVH, bar or column height indicates the volume of structure receiving a dose given by the bin. Bin doses are along the horizontal axis, and structure volumes (either percent or absolute volumes) are on the vertical. The differential DVH takes the appearance of a typical histogram. The total volume of the organ that receives a certain dose is plotted in the appropriate dose bin. This volume is determined by the total number of voxels characterized by a specified range of dosage for the organ considered. The differential DVH provides information about changes in dose within the structure considered as well as visualization of minimum and maximum dose. The cumulative DVH is plotted with bin doses along the horizontal axis, as well. However, the column height of the first bin (0‚Äì1 Gy, e.g.) represents the volume of structure receiving a dose greater than or equal to that dose. The column height of the second bin (1.001‚Äì2.000 Gy, e.g.) represents the volume of structure receiving greater than or equal to that dose, etc. With very fine (small) bin sizes, the cumulative DVH takes on the appearance of a smooth line graph. The lines always slope and start from top- left to bottom-right. For a structure receiving a very homogenous dose (100% of the volume receiving exactly 10 Gy, for example) the cumulative DVH will appear as a horizontal line at the top of the graph, at 100% volume as plotted vertically, with a vertical drop at 10 Gy on the horizontal axis.A cumulative DVH from a radiotherapy plan. A DVH used clinically usually includes all structures and targets of interest in the radiotherapy plan, each line plotted a different color, representing a different structure. The vertical axis is almost always plotted as percent volume (rather than absolute volume), as well. Drawbacks Clinical studies have shown that DVH metrics correlate with patient toxicity outcomes. A drawback of the DVH methodology is that it offers no spatial information; i.e., a DVH does not show where within a structure a dose is received. Also, DVHs from initial radiotherapy plans represent the doses to structures at the start of radiation treatment. As treatment progresses and time elapses, if there are changes (i.e. if patients lose weight, if tumors shrink, if organs change shape, etc.), the original DVH loses its accuracy.

The remains of the manor house, consisting of the old hall and the monastery cottages, are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and a scheduled monument It is one of only two surviving monastic manorial buildings in Cheshire, the other being Saighton Grange Gatehouse. History Ince Manor is one of the earliest recorded properties of St Werburgh's Abbey, Chester,The abbey church became Chester Cathedral at the dissolution of the monasteries. and was recorded in the Domesday Book. In 1277 Edward I was entertained at the manor. In 1399 and again in 1410 a licence to crenellate was obtained. Following the dissolution of the monasteries the manor remained in church ownership until 1547 when it passed to Sir Richard Cotton, and from his son George, to Sir Hugh Cholmondeley. It then passed to the Vale Royal branch of the Cholmondeleys until 1724, when it was sold by Charles Cholmondeley to Sir George Wynne of Leeswood. From his heiress, Margaret, the manor passed into the Waring family. The range of domestic buildings dates probably from the late 13th or 14th century and the hall from the early 15th century. The engraving dating from the early 18th century by the topographical draughtsmen and engraver-printsellers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck (pictured) shows the cottages to be a ruin. Ormerod described the surviving buildings in the 19th century which were standing in grounds of \\"rather more than an acre\\" with a stone wall to the south and the remains of a moat on the other sides. The former domestic buildings were in use as a farmhouse and the old hall was being used as a barn. Ince Manor Hall April 2008 October 2014 Restoration When the site was visited by the Chester Historic Buildings Preservation Trust in the early 1990s, the hall was protected by a 19th-century roof. The domestic buildings had been in use as cottages until the 1960s but were then without roofs. English Heritage advised that it would be proper to restore the buildings and a feasibility study showed that restoration would be possible. The buildings were bought from the owner by Cheshire County Council, who passed them to the Preservation Trust. Restoration began in 2002, with funding mainly from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The buildings are now back in private ownership. Stocks Adjacent to the manor are a pair of vertical stones embedded in the ground with grooves for timber stocks which are listed at Grade II.

This can be thought of as a generalisation of many classical methods‚Äîthe method of moments, least squares, and maximum likelihood‚Äîas well as some recent methods like M-estimators. The basis of the method is to have, or to find, a set of simultaneous equations involving both the sample data and the unknown model parameters which are to be solved in order to define the estimates of the parameters. Various components of the equations are defined in terms of the set of observed data on which the estimates are to be based. Important examples of estimating equations are the likelihood equations. Examples Consider the problem of estimating the rate parameter, Œª of the exponential distribution which has the probability density function: : f(x;\\\\lambda) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\lambda e^{-\\\\lambda x}, &\\\\; x \\\\ge 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, &\\\\; x < 0\\\\. \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. Suppose that a sample of data is available from which either the sample mean, \\\\bar{x}, or the sample median, m, can be calculated. Then an estimating equation based on the mean is :\\\\bar{x}=\\\\lambda^{-1}, while the estimating equation based on the median is :m=\\\\lambda^{-1} \\\\ln 2 . Each of these equations is derived by equating a sample value (sample statistic) to a theoretical (population) value. In each case the sample statistic is a consistent estimator of the population value, and this provides an intuitive justification for this type of approach to estimation.

Protti was born in Cremona. He studied in Parma, and made his debut in Pesaro, as Figaro, in 1948. He made his La Scala debut in 1950, as Amonasro, and sang there for many years. He sang widely in Italy and Europe in the standard Italian repertory, earning a reputation for being \\"one of the most reliable baritone in the business\\". In 1956, Protti appeared with the New York City Opera, in Rigoletto (with Norman Treigle as Sparafucile), Tosca (in Vladimir Rosing's staging), and the company premiere of Il trovatore (with Pier Miranda Ferraro). He made a belated debut at the Metropolitan Opera, as Rigoletto, in John Dexter's production, in 1985, at the age of sixty-five. He was particularly appreciated in Verdi roles, especially Rigoletto, his greatest role, but also as Alfio, Tonio, G√©rard, Scarpia, etc. Aldo Protti died in Cremona, aged seventy-five.

The sword was probably forged in Kinai region in the 5th century and buried with the deceased person in the late of the century. Its silver-inlaid inscription is the important source of the Japanese domestic politics in the period. Inscription The original Chinese text is as follows; :ÁéãË≥ú‚ñ°‚ñ°Êï¨ÂÆâ / Ê≠§‚ñ°ÔºàÂª∑Ôºâ‚ñ°ÔºàÂàÄÔºâ‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°„ÄåÁéãË≥ú„ÄçÈäòÈâÑÂâ£Ôºà„Åä„ÅÜ„Åó„ÇÅ„ÅÑ„Å¶„Å£„Åë„ÇìÔºâ , Â∏ÇÂéüÂ∏ÇÂüãËîµÊñáÂåñË≤°Ë™øÊüª„Çª„É≥„Çø„Éº In English; :King bestows (...)

Artifacts excavated around the tomb indicate the two were local warrior class nobles in the 5th century. Some scholars speculate the king mentioned in the inscription was King Sai, one of the five kings of Wa, written in the Chinese historical text Book of Song. In the Kofun period the polity in Kinai region advanced toward the unification of Japan. The sword, which was bestowed to the local ruling family by the king of Wa, is regarded as an example of the birth of the ancient unified state.„ÄåÁéãË≥ú„ÄçÈäòÈâÑÂâ£ , Â∏ÇÂéüÂ∏ÇÊïôËÇ≤ÂßîÂì°‰ºö See also * Seven-Branched Sword * Inariyama Sword * Eta Funayama Sword * T≈çdaijiyama Sword References External links *National Museum of Japanese History (archived) Category:Kofun period ","title":"Inaridai Sword"},{"id":"16693478","text":"Water scoop or mill, used for the production of Onta ware in the village of Onta in ≈åita Prefecture, Japan A water scoop is a simple hydropower machine - that is, a machine used to extract power from the flow of water.

The container side becomes heavier, and so the lever with the filled container moves downward, which may be used to operate a machine drive. In the lower position the container is emptied, and the lever moves back into the upward position. Because of their inferior efficiency compared to a water mill, water scoops are less common, and have been used in the past mostly for applications where linear motion is required rather than rotation, for example hammers in smitheries, saws in sawmills, and stamp mills in mining.

Approximately 300 fungi are known to be pathogenic to humans. The study of fungi pathogenic to humans is called \\"medical mycology\\". Although fungi are eukaryotic, many pathogenic fungi are microorganisms. The study of fungi and other organisms pathogenic to plants is called plant pathology. Candida Candida. Pap test specimen. Pap stain. Candida species cause infections in individuals with deficient immune systems. Th1-type cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is required for clearance of a fungal infection. Candida albicans is a kind of diploid yeast that commonly occurs among the human gut microflora. C. albicans is an opportunistic pathogen in humans. Abnormal over-growth of this fungus can occur, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. C. albicans has a parasexual cycle that appears to be stimulated by environmental stress. Aspergillus Aspergillosis. H&E; stain. The most common pathogenic species are Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus. Aspergillus flavus produces aflatoxin which is both a toxin and a carcinogen and which can potentially contaminate foods such as nuts. Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus clavatus can cause allergic disease. Some Aspergillus species cause disease on grain crops, especially maize, and synthesize mycotoxins including aflatoxin. Aspergillosis is the group of diseases caused by Aspergillus. The symptoms include fever, cough, chest pain or breathlessness. Usually, only patients with weakened immune systems or with other lung conditions are susceptible. The spores of Aspergillus fumigatus are ubiquitous in the atmosphere. A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen. It can cause potentially lethal invasive infection in immunocompromised individuals. A. fumigatus has a fully functional sexual cycle that produces cleistothecia and ascospores. Cryptococcus FNA specimen. Field stain. Cryptococcus neoformans can cause a severe form of meningitis and meningo-encephalitis in patients with HIV infection and AIDS. The majority of Cryptococcus species live in the soil and do not cause disease in humans. Cryptococcus neoformans is the major human and animal pathogen. Cryptococcus laurentii and Cryptococcus albidus have been known to occasionally cause moderate-to-severe disease in human patients with compromised immunity. Cryptococcus gattii is endemic to tropical parts of the continent of Africa and Australia and can cause disease in non- immunocompromised people. Infecting C. neoformans cells are usually phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages in the lung. The invading C. neoformans cells may be killed by the release of oxidative and nitrosative molecules by these macrophages. However some C. neoformans cells may survive within the macrophages. The ability of the pathogen to survive within the macrophages probably determines latency of the disease, dissemination and resistance to antifungal agents. In order to survive in the hostile intracellular environment of the macrophage, one of the responses of C. neoformans is to upregulate genes employed in responses to oxidative stress. The haploid nuclei of C. neoformans can undergo nuclear fusion (karyogamy) to become diploid. These diploid nuclei may then undergo meiosis, including recombination, resulting in the formation of haploid basidiospores that are able to disperse. Meiosis may facilitate repair of C. neoformans DNA in response to macrophage challenge. Histoplasma Histoplasmosis. PASD stain. Histoplasma capsulatum can cause histoplasmosis in humans, dogs and cats. The fungus is most prevalent in the Americas, India and southeastern Asia. It is endemic in certain areas of the United States. Infection is usually due to inhaling contaminated air. Pneumocystis Pneumocystis jirovecii (or Pneumocystis carinii) can cause a form of pneumonia in people with weakened immune systems, such as premature children, the elderly and AIDS patients. Stachybotrys Stachybotrys chartarum or \\"black mold\\" can cause respiratory damage and severe headaches. It frequently occurs in houses and in regions that are chronically damp. Host defense mechanisms = Endothermy = Mammalian endothermy and homeothermy are potent nonspecific defenses against most fungi. = Barrier tissues = The skin, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and the genital-urinary tract induced inflammation are common bodily regions of fungal infection. = Immune response = Studies have shown that hosts with higher levels of immune response cells such as monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and invariant natural killer (iNK) T-cells exhibited greater control of fungal growth and protection against systemic infection. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play an important role in inducing an immune response by recognizing specific fungal pathogens and initiating an immune response. In the case of mucosal candidiasis, the cells that produce cytokine IL-17 are extremely important in maintaining innate immunity.

It is sponsored by the Sea Turtle Restoration Project (STRP) and its parent organization, the Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN). The name of the campaign is a snowclone of the successful Got Milk? advertising campaign. History Although the STRP was founded to protect sea turtles in their natural habitats, the organization began the Got Mercury? campaign in 2002. The campaign advocates that supermarkets and restaurants post warning signs about mercury contamination in seafood, require them to regularly screen seafood for levels of mercury under one part per million and that species that contain the \\"highest levels of mercury\\" should be removed from the shelves. In 2004, the organization created an online mercury seafood calculator, one that was mimicked by the free market Center for Consumer Freedom not long thereafter. On March 17, 2008, Got Mercury? issued a report entitled, Mercury in Seafood: No Fair Warning, which included these findings:Mercury in Seafood: No Fair Warning (2008). * Mercury levels of swordfish and tuna tested from California markets often exceeded the FDA limit of 1 ppm. * Several California restaurant chains were chronically out of compliance with California Proposition 65 which requires restaurants serving mercury-contaminated seafood to post consumer advisory warnings. * About 70% of California supermarkets did not have adequate signage to warn consumers about mercury-contaminated seafood. Shortly after the release of the report, the National Fisheries Institute issued a press advisory urging reporters to disregard the report on the basis that it might cause public harm by leading individuals, including mothers and children, to consume less fish and lose the benefits from omega-3 fatty acids that can be important to early childhood development. In January 2011, the group secretly tested samples of seafood bought from California retailers. The group tested swordfish, tuna, halibut, and salmon for traces of methylmercury. The results of the study showed that tuna and swordfish purchased from some supermarkets and sushi restaurants contained as much as three times the FDA limit for mercury contamination. Representatives of the seafood industry criticized the report, arguing that it might lead consumers to eat less seafood and thus be detrimental to public health. Pamela Tom, manager of the seafood extension program at the University of California at San Diego also noted that no cases of methylmercury poisoning have been found from fish documented with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Funding Currently, the Turtle Island Restoration Network provides organizational support for the STRP, Got Mercury?, as well as the SPAWN. Between 1999 and 2008, the Turtle Island Restoration Network has received $93,000 from the Foundation for Deep Ecology, an organization founded by fashion executive Douglas Tompkins.

Circumstances of death Dennis O'Neill, 12, lived in Newport, Monmouthshire. On 30 May 1944 Dennis and his younger brothers, Terence (Terry), 9, and Frederick (Freddie), 7, were committed to the care of Newport County Borough Council by Newport Juvenile Court on the grounds that they were in need of care and attention.\\"Causes of Boy's Death\\", The Times, 13 February 1945. On 5 July 1944 the Newport Education Committee, exercising powers under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, sent Dennis and Terence to live with Reginald Gough, 31, and his wife Esther, 29, at their remote farm, Bank Farm, in the Hope Valley, near Minsterley, Shropshire, England. Frederick was sent to a Mr and Mrs Pickering nearby. At 1:00 pm on 9 January 1945, Esther Gough telephoned the local doctor to tell him that Dennis was having a fit. The doctor arrived at 3:30 pm to find that he was already dead and was in an appalling condition. An inquest found that he had died of cardiac failure after being struck several heavy blows on the chest, and had also been beaten with a stick on the back. He was undernourished, thin and wasted, and well below normal average weight for his age. He had a number of septic ulcers on his feet and his legs were severely chapped.\\"Underfed Boy Beaten with Stick\\", The Times, 6 February 1945. On 3 February 1945, Reginald Gough was charged with manslaughter and Esther Gough with wilful ill- treatment, neglect and exposure likely to cause suffering and injury. On 12 February 1945 she, too, was charged with manslaughter. Committal On 13 February 1945, the Goughs appeared before Pontesbury Magistrates' Court. =Terence O'Neill's testimony= On the first day of the committal proceedings, Terence testified that they were usually given three slices of bread and butter each per day, and that and tea was their only sustenance. They stole whatever they could from the pantry to supplement this. Dennis would suck milk from the teats of the farm cows. Every night both boys were given a severe thrashing on their hands and/or legs, sometimes up to 100 blows each.\\"Foster-Parents Charged\\", The Times, 14 February 1945. On 6 January 1945, Dennis had been ordered out to collect sticks. He came home shivering with only a handful of sticks and was forced out again by Gough using his stick. He stood in the yard crying and was dragged to the spinney by his hair by Mrs Gough. That night he was thrashed for taking a bite from a swede. The following day he was stripped naked by Gough and thrashed with a stick so hard that it broke; Gough then thrashed him with another stick until his legs were blue and bleeding. The next day he was unable to stand up and when Terence came home from school he found his brother locked in a cubbyhole in the kitchen. His feet were by now in a terrible condition and Gough hit him to try to make him stop crying. Dennis complained that his back hurt. Gough beat him with his fists again the following morning; he died in the afternoon. On the second day of the committal proceedings Terence gave another three hours of testimony about their mistreatment. The following day he was recalled again and admitted that the boys had sometimes misbehaved and deserved to be punished. Gough had played cricket and football with them and the Goughs insisted the boys said their prayers every night. This time he said that they all ate the same food.\\"Boy's Death at Farm\\", The Times, 15 February 1945. =Other testimony= Miss Eirlys Edwards, a clerk in Newport Education Department (with no training or experience in matters of child welfare), testified on the second day that she visited Bank Farm on 20 December 1944, and observed that the boys were treated with little affection, and while Terence appeared to be well cared for, Dennis appeared ill and frightened; she asked Mrs Gough to call a doctor to examine him, which she said she would do. She had recommended to her superiors that the boys be removed and Mr W. J. Edmonds, Newport's Deputy Director of Education, confirmed that he had requested Shropshire Education Committee to do so, although the Goughs had not yet been informed of this decision. On the third day, Police Sergeant Macpherson testified that he had visited the farm following Dennis's death and found that the boys' bedroom was dirty and poorly furnished, whereas the Goughs' room was pleasant, neat and tidy. He said that Mrs Gough stated that Dennis had started complaining that his feet hurt soon after he came to live with them and that he was always late getting up. She had stated that the boys had been fighting the night before Dennis's death and it was this that had caused the marks on his body. She and her husband had, she said, hit the boys only very rarely, and then only on the hand for misbehaving. Trial The Goughs were both committed for trial at Shrewsbury Assizes and were refused bail. However, on 27 February 1945, Mr Justice Hilbery transferred the case to Stafford Assizes at the request of counsel.\\"The Gough Trial: Transfer to Stafford Assizes\\", The Times, 28 February 1945. The trial opened at Stafford on 15 March 1945, before Mr Justice Wrottesley. W. H. Cartwright Sharp KC prosecuted, J. F. Bourke represented Mr Gough, and A. J. Long KC represented Mrs Gough.\\"Foster Parents on Trial\\", The Times, 16 March 1945. The court heard that the Goughs' contract required them to bring up Dennis O'Neill as one of their own children in return for ¬£1 per week. The court heard much the same testimony as in the committal hearings. However, it appeared that Terence had initially been somewhat confused about the sequence of events. The prosecution claimed that Dennis was tied to a bench and beaten with a stick for eating a swede the day before he died. Dr Holloway Davies, the local doctor called by Mrs Gough, testified that when he arrived Dennis had been dead for between four and six hours. That proved that Dennis had already been dead for some time when Mrs Gough called Dr Davies. On the second day, Reginald Gough gave evidence. He claimed that he and his wife were kind to the boys and fed them very well. The boys were frequently naughty, but were rarely disciplined. He claimed that the incident with the bench occurred, but he was only having a joke, did not actually tie Dennis to the bench, did not beat him, and they were all laughing about it.\\"Foster Parents on Trial\\", The Times, 17 March 1945. Mrs Gough gave evidence on the third day of the trial. She testified that she had married her husband in February 1942, having left the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) in June 1941. They had no children of their own. She corroborated some of Terence's testimony about her husband's treatment of Dennis, and said she was afraid of her husband and that she believed that had she originally told the truth to the police she would also be dead. Her husband had told her that Dennis was dead and instructed her to lie to the doctor.\\"Trial of Foster Parents\\", The Times, 19 March 1945. The judge instructed the jury that they could not find Mrs Gough guilty of manslaughter, since only Mr Gough was strong enough to have inflicted the trauma which killed Dennis, but they could still find her guilty of neglect. On 19 March 1945, Reginald Gough was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to six years in prison. Esther Gough was found guilty of neglect and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The jury deliberated for only twenty minutes.\\"Gough Found Guilty\\", The Times, March 20, 1945. It transpired that Gough had been convicted of common assault against his wife in 1942 and she had left him in July of that year, applying for a separation order on the grounds of persistent cruelty on 6 August 1942, but had later returned to live with him. The judge said that he took this into account before sentencing her, but her own ill-treatment was no excuse for her neglect of the boys. Inquiries =Parliament= The case was first raised in the House of Commons on 8 February 1945, by Kenneth Lindsay MP.\\"Parliament: Case of Dennis O'Neill\\", The Times, 9 February 1945. It was raised on a number of occasions thereafter. =Public inquiry= Politicians and the public were shocked by the case, especially that Gough had been given custody of the boys although he was known to the police and had a conviction for violence and that no inspection of the boys' welfare was made until they had been with the Goughs for six months. On 22 March 1945, the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, announced that a public inquiry would be held into the case. Sir Walter Monckton KC was appointed to conduct the inquiry.\\"Home Office Inquiry in O'Neill Case\\", The Times, 27 March 1945. The inquiry opened at Newport Civic Centre on 10 April 1945.\\"O'Neill Inquiry\\", The Times, 11 April 1945 It reported on 28 May 1945. The report criticised both councils involved, but did not name any specific individual(s) and acknowledged that the failings were not deliberate.\\"Report on O'Neill Inquiry\\", The Times, 29 May 1945. =Shropshire inquiry= On 26 March 1945 Shropshire County Council began its own inquiry, although this was held in private. It was chaired by Sir Offley Wakeman. The inquiry reported on 30 June 1945, and called for a thorough reorganisation of the boarding-out of children. It accepted all blame placed upon the council by the public inquiry, but did not place any particular blame on any specific individual(s).\\"Shropshire Council on Gough Case\\", The Times, 2 July 1945. Results On 1 January 1947 new Home Office and Ministry of Health regulations on the boarding-out of children came into force as a direct result of the Monckton Report. The principal requirements were:\\"Children Boarded Out: New Rules for Local Authorities\\", The Times, 13 December 1946. *Each local authority was required to appoint a boarding-out committee, at least three of whose members were to be women and which had to meet at least every three months. The committee was to be responsible for finding suitable foster homes and to exercise supervision over all the authority's foster children. *An official was required to visit every foster child within a month of their being placed and thereafter at least once every six weeks. They were required to submit a written report, taking into account any complaint made by the child. *A doctor was to be appointed for every foster child and was to examine the child within one month of their being placed and at least once a year thereafter. *No child was to be fostered or remain fostered by a person with any criminal conviction rendering them unsuitable to be a foster parent or in any environment likely to be detrimental to them. The case was a significant contributory factor leading to the Children Act 1948. In 1947 Agatha Christie wrote a radio play called Three Blind Mice loosely based on the case. This eventually developed into the long-running play The Mousetrap. Terry O'Neill has published a non-fiction book about the case. Called Someone to Love Us, it was released on 4 March 2010, the day after what would have been Dennis's 78th birthday.Terry O'Neill book Footnotes Category:Foster care Category:Child abuse in the United Kingdom Category:British manslaughter victims Category:People from Newport, Wales Category:1945 deaths Category:Child abuse resulting in death Category:1932 births Category:Incidents of violence against boys Category:Violence against children ","title":"Dennis O'Neill case"},{"id":"16693582","text":"Eurogroup for Animals is an animal protection lobby group based in Brussels, Belgium, that seeks to improve animal welfare standards in the European Union. The association represents animal protection organisations in 26 of the 27 EU Member States and several other countries. Since it was launched in 1980, the association has succeeded in ensuring that the European Union is a world leader in animal welfare standards. Indeed, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, a requirement has been included in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (one of the two fundamental Treaties on which the Union is founded) stating that, since animals are sentient beings, the EU Institutions and the Member States must pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals in the formulation and implementation of Union policy. Eurogroup for Animals provides advice and expertise on animal welfare to various European institutions, such as the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament. It also provides the secretariat of the European Parliamentary Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals, which meets at the European Parliament in Strasbourg once a month. Eurogroup for Animals also works closely together with retailers to encourage them to adopt higher standards of animal welfare. The association works to improve the welfare of animals that are farmed (poultry, bovines, ovines, caprines, swine, etc.) or caught wild for the purposes of human consumption (i.e. fish), animals used in science (rabbits, rodents, etc.), companion animals (conventional pets, such as dogs and cats, and animals kept for the purposes of companionship, such as equines) and wild animals. History The British RSPCA founded Eurogroup for Animals in 1980 (Britain was at the time in the EU) along with five other organisations in other EU Member States (Dierenbescherming in the Netherlands, Deutscher Tierschutzbund in Germany, Dyrenes Beskyttelse in Denmark, La Soci√©t√© Protectrice des Animaux (SPA) in France and L√´tzebuerger D√©iereschutzliga in Luxembourg) after noticing more and more legislation relating to animals was being decided at a European level.Nuffield Council on Bioethics It is one of the longest established lobby groups in Brussels, and has grown over the years to represent animal protection organisations in 26 of the 27 Member States of the European Union, as well as in several third countries, including Britain, Switzerland, Norway, Serbia, the United States and Australia. It seized on the European Union‚Äôs expansion into central and east Europe to support animal protection organisations there. Several global organisations such as Animals International, Compassion in World Farming and World Animal Protection are also members of Eurogroup for Animals.

V. 1963. Some Aspects of the theory of dichotomous keys. New Phytologist, 62 (2): 144-160.Payne, R. W. & Preece, D. A. 1977. Incorporating checks against observer error into identification keys. New Phytol. 79: 203-209.Payne, R. W. 1977. Reticulation and other methods of reducing the size of printed diagnostic keys. J. Gen. Microbiol. 98: 595-597. In a reticulated key, multiple paths lead to the same result; the tree data structure thus changes from a simple tree to a directed acyclic graph. Two forms of reticulation can be distinguished: Terminal reticulation and inner reticulation. * In a terminal reticulation a single taxon or next-level-key is keyed out in several locations in the key. This type of reticulation is normally compatible with any printable presentation format of identification keys and normally does not require special precautions in software used for branching keys. * In an inner reticulation a couplet with further leads can be reached through more than one path. Depending on the software or printable presentation format, this may be more challenging. For the linked (= \\"parallel\\" or \\"bracketed\\") format, where each lead points to a numbered couplet, inner reticulations present no special challenge. However, for the nested (= \\"indented\\") presentation format, where all following couplets immediately follow their lead, a cross-connection to a different subtree in the key requires a special mechanism. Reticulations generally improve the usability of a key, but may also diminish the overall probability of correct identification averaged over all taxa.Osborne, D. V. 1963.

K. (2000). Stamp, Edward. Dictionary of Canadian Biography. Born at Alnwick in Northumberland, Stamp served as the captain of a steam transport in the Crimean War in 1854. In 1865, he formed the British Columbia and Vancouver Island Spar, Lumber and Saw Mill Company to establish a sawmill and logging rights on Burrard Inlet. The company first attempted to locate the mill at Brockton Point in what is now Stanley Park, but inshore currents and a nearby reef made the site impractical and the site was shifted about a mile farther east, on the south side of the inlet. Because of several business challenges, and perhaps his own difficult personality, Stamp's relationship with the company and his management position came to an end on 2 January 1869. In 1870 the mill was renamed Hastings Mill and eventually seeded the settlement from which the city of Vancouver developed. Stamp had a minor career in politics, serving on the Legislative Council of British Columbia in 1867 and 1868. He died at Turnham Green, Middlesex, on 20 January 1872.

According to Rushdie this is his \\"most researched book\\" which required \\"years and years of reading\\". The novel was published on 11 April 2008 by Jonathan Cape London, and in the United States by Random House.David Gates, \\"A World of Marvels\\", Sunday Book Review, The New York Times, June 8, 2008. Accessed 3 December 2017. Plot outline The central theme of The Enchantress of Florence is the visit of a European to the Mughal emperor Akbar's court and his claim that he is a long lost relative of Akbar, born of an exiled Indian princess and an Italian from Florence. The story moves between continents, the court of Akbar to Renaissance Florence mixing history, fantasy and fable. =Part one= The tale of adventure begins in Fatehpur Sikri, the capital of Mughal emperor Akbar the Great, when a stranger arrives, having stowed away on a pirate ship captained by the Scottish Lord Hauksbank, and sets the Mughal court talking and looking back into its past. =Part two= The stranger begins to tell Akbar the tale, going back to the boyhood of three friends in Florence, Il Machia, Ago Vespucci and Nino Argalia, the last of whom became an adventurer in the East. =Part three= The tale returns to the mobs and clamour of Florence in the hands of the Medici dynasty. An eight-page bibliography follows the end of the story.\\"A Woman's Struggle: Rushdie's 'Enchantress'\\", All Things Considered, NPR, June 9, 2008. Accessed 3 December 2017. Major themes The book relates a succession of interweaving stories by a variety of storytellers, travellers and adventurers and of course touches on the histories and cultures of the various settings including the Mughal and Ottoman Empires, the earlier Mongols, and Renaissance Florence. There is a strong theme of sex and eroticism, much of it surrounding the Enchantress of the book's title, who was inspired by the Renaissance poem Orlando Furioso. There is also a recurring discussion of humanism and debate as opposed to authoritarianism, and Machiavelli is a character in the book. Like Rushdie's previous works, the book can be considered a work of magic realism.

He hired the premises, drew stage curtains and designs, and wrote pieces for the hero of Schmid's shows, Kasperl Larifari, a descendant of Hans Wurst and all the classical comic figures in traditional European puppetry.

The film premiered at the Universal Cinema in London on 6 March 1975. It is the sequel to the film Alfie (1966), with Alan Price taking over Michael Caine's role of Alfie. Price also penned the movie title song, The Sequel cost ¬£500 thousand Pounds to produce and promote. eventually Alfie Darling made ¬£2.5 million pounds at the UK box office, finishing 7th as the most popular movie in the UK. performed and released as a single by Cilla Black who was also the first to record the title song based on the original movie, penned by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. It is based on the novel of the same name by Bill Naughton (who wrote the play upon which the first film was based). Plot After experiencing a failure in the ending of the earlier film, Alfie - now working as a London to France HGV driver alongside Bakey (Paul Copley) - decides to get back to his old self. And his new occupation provides new opportunities to do so. The film starts as Bakey drives the truck through customs in France, while Alfie has sex with an English hitchhiker (Vicki Michelle) in the back until the customs' officer catches her topless. When arriving at their destination, he spots a woman (Jill Townsend) in a sports car. They start racing until the police break it up. Alfie soon finds comfort by flirting with the married waitress Louise (Rula Lenska), who takes him to her apartment. During the night, her husband returns from his fishing trip, but Bakey, outside in the truck, sounds the horn as a warning. Alfie later catches up with the woman from the race and learns her name is Abby and that she is a sophisticated magazine editor. When she turns him down, he proceeds to stalk her until, after another car chase, she finally agrees to a date. When Alfie gets his wish, he suffers erectile dysfunction and leaves her apartment in anger. This failure causes him to use his little black book to contact various women with whom he has a casual relationship. However, some of these encounters lead him into trouble. He faces the consequences of an encounter with Norma (Sheila White) and the wrath of the husband of older Fay (Joan Collins), when said husband discovers Alfie's wallet under their bed. With Fay's encouragement, Alfie apologizes to Abby about leaving her apartment in a huff and asks her for a proper dinner. On a holiday in France, he tells her what he never says to his lovers ‚Äì that he loves her and wants her to marry him. She initially refuses. Alfie angrily insists that he has asked her to marry him, demanding to know what the hell is wrong with her that she refused. As he leaves their hotel room, he tells her that if she is making an idiot of him, he will kill her. Back in the UK, Alfie suffers a minor accident and is bed-ridden. Abby pays him a visit to apologise for refusing his marriage proposal, and expresses her acceptance. She then has to take a quick work-related flight. When Abby leaves for the airport, Alfie's older neighbor, Claire (Annie Ross), hears from another neighbor that Alfie can't move, she lets herself into his apartment and serves him tea. When Alfie comments on Claire's perfume, she reveals her true feelings for him by suddenly entering his bed and taking her top off. She ignores his protests but then her attempts to mount him fix his back, and he escapes before she succeeds in making actual intimate contact. Alfie catches Abby before her flight takes off, and they decide to marry the following day. In the morning Alfie waits for her in the airport, not having heard that her plane has crashed without any survivors. Upon learning the news, Alfie drives to the crash site and cries over the wreckage.

The fort was founded by a Duke of Savoy, and completed by Vauban in the reign of Louis XIV. It was destroyed by the Austrians in 1815, but was rebuilt by the French, and at the same time considerably strengthened and heightened. The high-road intersects a portion of this fortification.Karl Baedeker.

The route national 84 passed through the fort until 1939 when it was relocated to a tunnel through the rock behind the fort, defended by a casemate in the tunnel built as part of the Maginot Line fortification program. The casemate was intended to receive 47mm anti-tank guns, but was never equipped. It is linked to the lower fort by a tunnel. The Fort l'√âcluse was the largest component of the otherwise weakly fortified Defensive Sector of the Rh√¥ne. Fort l'√âcluse video The upper fort (fort sup√©rieure) is above the lower fort. Its location allows the upper fort to control the valley, including the railroad viaduct, and to protect the lower fort. It was built between 1834 and 1848. Today, the lower fort and the subterranean steps and casemates cut into the rock above it, up to and including terraces just below the upper fort, are open during the summer months for visiting, however the upper fort is not currently safe for visitors. Furthermore, a moderately difficult (AD)ViaFerrata.org Fort l'Ecluse . Retrieved 17 August 2009. via ferrata exists which takes climbers from the lower fort to the upper fort by traversing the rocky hillside. In addition, there are many hiking trails in the area which allow hikers access to the upper fort. History In his Commentaries on the Gallic War, Julius Caesar describes the defile as \\"narrow and difficult ... by which carts could be scarcely drawn one at a time, and moreover a very high mountain overhung it, so that very few could easily defend it.\\"angustum et difficile ... vix qua singuli carri ducerentur, mons autem altissimus impendebat, ut facile perpauci prohibere possent Bell. Gall. 1.6. In their attempt to migrate to southwestern Gaul in 58 BC, the Helvetii initially tried to avoid this route by asking Caesar's permission to cross the Rhone into Roman territory at Geneva; when Caesar refused, they attempted to force their way across at several places, only to be rebuffed by a line of fortifications nineteen Roman miles long that Caesar had hastily constructed along the southern bank of the river. In the end, the Helvetii secured safe passage through the defile via an exchange of hostages with the Sequani, who inhabited the area.Bell. Gall. 1.7-9. In 1184, a church and residence belonging to the Saint-Claude abbey was built on the site. During the Middle Ages tolls were collected for passage. In the 13th century a fortified house was built at the site by the Sire de Gex. In 1293 the house was ceded to Amadeus V, Count of Savoy. In 1601 the Treaty of Lyon placed Gex in the hands of the French crown. The fort was greatly expanded in the 17th century. The fort played a part in preventing French Protestants from leaving France following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The fort was burned in 1815 by Austrian forces and reconstructed in following years. The upper fort was built, linked to the lower fort by a tunneled stairway with 1165 steps. By 1860 Savoy became a permanent part of France and the fort was no longer of importance in controlling the frontier. During World War I the fort served as a military training center. In the 1930s the fort was incorporated into French frontier fortifications as a contingency against a German incursion through Switzerland. However, the Germans ultimately arrived from the west, rather than the east. The fort held the passage of the Rh√¥ne against German forces in June 1940 during the Battle of France. A single company of the 179th Alpine Fortress Battalion, augmented with an artillery battery and personnel from a pioneers regiment under Lieutenant Mestrallet held the fort with 250 men against Panzergruppe von Kleist, composed of the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions and the 13th Motorized Infantry Division. For three days from 22 June the French force held the German advance. After the 25 June armistice, the fort's garrison stood its ground until directly ordered by the French command to stand down and to surrender. Present status The Fort l'√âcluse was purchased by a syndicate of nineteen communities of the Pays de Gex and is operated as a museum. It has been open to the public since 1995.

A 2012 report by the Alzheimer‚Äôs Association states that 15 million of those family caregivers are caring for a person with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease or another dementia. The value of the voluntary, \\"unpaid\\" caregiving service provided by caregivers was estimated at $310 billion in 2006 ‚Äî almost twice as much as was actually spent on home care and nursing services combined. By 2009, about 61.6 million caregivers were providing \\"unpaid\\" care at a value that had increased to an estimated $450 billion.Feinberg, L., Reinhard, S., & Choula, R. AARP, Public Policy Institute. (2011). Valuing the invaluable: 2011 update the growing contributions and costs of family caregiving. It is projected that nearly one in five United States citizens will be 65 years of age or older by the year 2030. By 2050 this older population is expected to double in size.[Vincent, G., Velkoff, V. (2010). The next four decades the older population in the United States: 2010 to 2050. U.S. Census Bureau] Family caregiver experience A 2011 survey of family caregivers in the United States found that almost half (46%) take on tasks that are traditionally considered ‚Äúnursing‚Äù or ‚Äúmedical,‚Äù such as injections, wound care, and operating medical equipment and monitors. While the family caregivers‚Äô assumption of such responsibilities is not new, the frequency may have increased over time due to shorter hospital stays, adults living longer with significant ailments, and technological and health care improvements allowing more nursing or medical care to be provided at home. This trend has implications for families, patients, family caregivers‚Äô workplaces, health care organizations, and insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid. A survey by AARP in 2010 states that \\"29% of the U.S. adult population, or 65.7 million people, are caregivers, including 31% of all households. These caregivers provide an average of 20 hours of care per week.\\" 1.4 million children ages 8 to 18 provide care for an adult relative; 72% are caring for a parent or grandparent. Fortunately, most are not the sole caregiver. 30% of family caregivers caring for seniors are themselves aged 65 or over; another 15% are between the ages of 45 to 54. =Caregiver gain= As discussed above, there are benefits to the caregiving experience. New research even reports gains in cognitive function in older women who provide informal (unpaid) care on a continuing basis.Bertrand, R.M., Saczynski, J.S., Mezzacappa, C., Hulse, M., Ensrud, K., & Fredman, L. (2011). Caregiving and cognitive function in older women: Evidence for the healthy caregiver hypothesis. Journal of Aging and Health, 24(1), 48-66. This cross-sectional study tested over 900 participants at baseline and again after two years for memory and processing speed, functions which are necessary for many caregiving tasks. The participants were divided into three groups, those who were caregivers over the entire two-year period, those who were caregivers at the start of the study but not at the two-year follow-up, and those who were not caregivers at any time during the research period. At follow-up, those who were caregivers throughout the study had the highest scores for both cognitive functions but also the highest reported levels of stress, while those participants who were not caregivers at any time during the study had the lowest scores for both cognitive functions and the lowest reported levels of stress. These results are consistent with the healthy caregiver hypothesis which states that while those older adults who are more likely to be caregivers are healthier to start with, it is the work of caregiving that helps keep them healthier than older adults who are not caregivers. This model contrasts with the long-held idea that the stress of caregiving results in poorer functioning over time. In contrast, subsequent research has found that the benefit to family caregivers varies depending on the health of the person receiving care. Higher numbers of chronic conditions among those receiving care were associated with increased job stress, concern over making harmful errors, hypervigilance, feelings of depression, and feelings of suboptimal health among family caregivers. Nevertheless, family caregivers reported that they felt emotionally closer to the care recipient and that they were making a positive contribution to the care recipient‚Äôs life. In addition, training in medical and nursing tasks was found to have a protective effect for the family caregiver. Research has also found that most family caregivers said they had not received training about medication management from a professional, but rather had learned it on their own. In addition to this, optimism significantly mediated some of the relationship between angry reaction and vitality. =Taking care of the caregiver= One of the most common negative outcomes of being a caretaker is the infringement on time and activities. In most cases, this role becomes a full-time job in itself and does not leave much time for leisure activities the caregiver liked to participate in before becoming a primary caregiver. While this seems like an obvious outcome of caregiving, it is a critical cause of depression and if steps are not taken to intervene and provide the primary caretaker with adequate off time then they will quickly become not only depressed but resentful of their role as well [Montgomery, R., Rowe, J., & Kosloski, K. (2007). Handbook of gerontology: Evidence-based approaches to theory, practice, and policy. (pp. 426-430). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.] Other negative outcomes of being an informal primary caregiver can include an unfavorable relationship forming between the caregiver and receiver dyad as well as declines in both physical and mental health of the caregiver. wide variety of health issues that arise from being a primary caregiver. They reported that when caregivers were compared to equal non-caregivers, they were found to have a 15% lower level of antibody response and a 23% higher level of stress hormones in their bodies. This indicates the stress and strain placed upon primary caregivers can greatly impact their health and ability to recover from illness themselves.[Vitaliano, P., Young, H., & Zhang, J. (2004). Is caregiving a risk factor for illness. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 13(1).] There are, however, strategies that caregivers and communities can use to reduce the effects of this added stress. Providing a type of respite care is the easiest intervention to reduce this negative outcome. It varies in forms, but the basic principle of respite care is to provide temporary care for a care recipient when their primary caregiver must be absent. It can be as informal as sitting with someone while the caregiver runs errands to a more formal setting such as an Adult Day Service or even overnight stay in an hospital or nursing home facility.[Sultz, H. A., & Young, K. M. (2011). Health care USA. (7th ed.). Sudbury, MA: Jones & Bartlett Publishers.] Information, resources and support are often available through senior centers and local public health departments, but more research is needed to determine what services are helpful. Two studies that investigated the effectiveness of different interventions on the health of caregivers are described below. The Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH) II interventionElliott, A.F., Burgio, L.D., & DeCoster, J. (2010). Enhancing caregiver health: Findings from the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health II intervention. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, 58, 30-37. was a randomized clinical trial that provided self-care educational information and training on self-care skills, tailored to each caregiver's needs, to the intervention group, or a basic health information packet and two non-educational phone calls to the control group. Each intervention was designed to deal with a participant's personal issues using information provided by the caregiver at the beginning of the study, and researchers were personally involved during the 12 face-to-face and telephone sessions. At the end of the six-month study period, those receiving the intervention reported better physical and emotional health and less \\"burden and bother\\" with their caregiving duties than those in the control group. Another study tested the effectiveness of three different interventions (a support group, provision of literature on self-care and caregiving, and creative movement) on five mental health variables of caregiving daughters of frail mothers.Donorfio, L.K.M., Vetter, R., & Vracevic, M. (2010). Effects of three caregiver interventions: Support, educational literature, and creative movement. Journal of Women and Aging, 22, 61-75. Each study participant chose the intervention that appealed to her most, rather than being randomly assigned to one. Study participants were then evaluated for self-reported irritability, depression, anxiety, stress, and concentration, and asked to assess the chosen intervention on an ongoing basis. Comparing the outcomes of the five variables, the support group's self-ratings suggested greater improvement than the literature group while the creative movement group was too small for a meaningful comparison. The participants' assessments of all three interventions were positive, with caregivers using words such as \\"validation,\\" \\"reinforcement,\\" and \\"relaxing.\\" All study participants agreed that they would choose to participate again, and in the same intervention group. Those in the support group found the intervention so helpful that they continued to meet after the study's completion. For caregivers without the ability to join nearby support groups, online support groups such as a caregiver forum can offer similar benefits. A different study has shown that family caregivers whose loved ones receive round the clock migrant home care services report greater satisfaction with the services, lower levels of burden, higher levels of subjective health and better well-being compared with home care services provided for only several hours per week. This is despite the fact that the group that relied on round the clock migrant home care workers had lower physical functioning. Signs of caregiver stress Caregiver stress is the emotional and physical strain of care giving. Avoiding Caregiver Burnout Caregiver stress explodes when the caregiver can't get much of a break - whether it is emotional or physical, a needed break is what makes it possible for the caregiver to function. The Be Well Bistro Caregiver's Corner offers strategies to support the caregiver such as: Tips for avoiding burnout are to know the signs and have a plan in place to combat the burnout. Some signs: *Anger or annoyance at all kinds of things *Exhaustion *Nagging aches and pains *Over eating or Loss of appetite *Loss of interest in personal goals *Loss of joy in doing things once loved *Wanting to run away It happens all too fast. And most caregiver stress can be avoided with a strategy to avoid it. Here are some tips: *Enlist family members to pitch in *Enlist a friend or a few friends *Create a care group so friends, family, or neighbors can coordinate to give the caregiver some respite *Think Outsourcing: Make a list of all the chores you don't want to do. Find a way to bring in help. If your family or friends can't or won't help, maybe a local church group, community respite organization. Ask on Facebook if anyone in your community knows someone‚Äîor ask a local email group. Think outside the box. *Find a local support group where you can meet people in person. *Find a Psychotherapeutic intervention. Banish the Negatives Guilt, Worry and Shame serve no one. You didn't cause this. You can't control it and you can't fix it. Any time you feel these emotions, ask yourself if they are true. They aren't - but ask anyway. You are only one person. You know when you need a break. And when the person receiving care keeps adding on to you already empty reserves of energy, you can't always take it. When that happens, find a way to take a break. A full day off and way is essential. You may need to take your person to an Adult Care Day location‚ÄîYou might need to hire someone to stay at your house. But you have to get away. Coach Nancy Lamb at the BeWellBistro.com has tons of tips and offers support to others. No one can do this caregiving alone. The isolation is unbearable. She writes for 3 websites and offers workshops, tips, and stress management plans. Caregiving is usually not a planned thing, but a loving person notices things are needed and starts slowly doing them. Caring for elderly parents for 23 years, and then finding herself in a situation where the caregiving just didn't end, Nancy became an unwitting expert in self-preservation while in the throes of caregiving. Caregiving versus Caretaking In many dysfunctional groups, there is one person who ends up being the over responsible caretaker who gets their self-esteem from caring for other members. They do too much for others and not enough for themselves. What it means in recovery circles is that the person is doing for others what they can and should be doing for themselves. In the alcoholic work place, people cover for the worker who routinely misses deadlines, comes in late, or gets sick too often. In the alcoholic home, it's the person who cleans up, covers up, calls in sick for another person, or does everything they can to make the home life look normal when it isn't. That is unhealthy caretaking and a learned behavior. In a Caregiving Home, the lines can be sometimes blurred. It may start slowly when the one needing care may need help after an illness or surgery. The caregiver finds it natural to help. The patient gets used to this help. The challenge for the caregiver is to know where to draw the line. Caregiver's are naturally giving and helpful people. Compassion is their core strength‚Äîbut they run the risk of caretaking when they do too much for the person. There is a need for balancing caregiving when it is needed with caretaking where it is too much of one person feeling improperly responsible for duties that should be handled by the other person.

It encompasses music from the Spanish-speaking islands and coasts of the Caribbean, as well as genres rooted in this region such as salsa. In the 1940s and 1950s, the term tropical music was created to cover all music from the hispanophone Caribbean excluding Cuban music, which had its own category and niche within the American (and to a lesser extent European) music market. However, later in the 20th century after the Cuban Revolution, tropical music gained a broader meaning and began to be used in order to distinguish Caribbean genres such as cumbia and son cubano from inland genres such as tejano and norte√±o. Characteristics Due to its geographical roots, tropical music generally combines elements from European and African traditions. An example of this is the process of binarization of ternary rhythms brought from Africa, which took place originally in Cuba, later spreading throughout the rest of the Caribbean and Latin America. The presence of syncopated polyrhythms of African origin make most tropical music naturally dance-oriented. Tropical music instrumentation also includes both European (tres, piano, trumpet, timbales) and African-descended (congas, bongos, marimba) instruments. During the late 20th century, contemporary instruments such as synthesizers and drum machines were incorporated. History Despite being a concept created in the 20th century within the music industry, tropical music encompasses genres and styles that can be traced back to the 16th century, when the Caribbean (and thus America) was discovered and colonized by Europeans. It was not until the 19th century that tropical music became a global phenomenon with the popularization of Cuban contradanza (also known as habanera). Cuba would continue to spearhead the development of tropical music with other ballroom music styles, as well as the bolero and son cubano. The Dominican Republic contributed with merengue and bachata, two very successful genres, while Puerto Rican music is exemplified by relatively minor genres such as bomba and plena. The very popular cumbia and vallenato originated on the coasts of Colombia. Tropical music would have a long-lasting impact in the music of other regions beyond the Caribbean such as the United States (where rhumba and salsa were primarily developed), Africa (where soukous was developed), and South America. For example, in Chile, tropical music genres were progressively introduced depending on their popularity in the Caribbean and North America. Thus, genres such as guaracha, mambo, cha cha cha and later cumbia made their way into the radios and concert halls of Chile between the 1930s and 1960s. Radio format Tropical music also refers to a music format common in Latin music radio stations.Mexican Tropical Radio Format Among the most popular tropical styles are salsa, merengue, vallenato, cumbia and bachata.

At some time it was known as \\"Alsop en le Dale for Alstonefield.\\" History Opened by the London and North Western Railway, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. It was then closed to regular traffic by the British Transport Commission and finally for excursions by the British Railways Board. The line From Hurdlow the line had been fairly easily graded, but at Alsop Moor, roughly halfway from Hartington it began to fall sharply at 1 in 60 and would continue to do so into Ashbourne. From Alsop to the next station at Tissington the fall was at 1 in 71. The descent to Alsop was through Cold Eaton Cutting, deep and long, requiring the removal of of limestone. Two years after the line opened, a train of six-wheeled carriages became derailed by snow and was marooned for three days, during which time the crew were given hot food and drinks by local farmers.

However, its distance from the village meant that when bus services began, it lost much of its local trade.

An occasion of charge to Inheritance Tax may not only be the death of an individual, but may also the date of a gift or of another act causing (or deemed to cause) a transfer of value to occur from one person to another person, trust or entity. The concept of the Nil Rate Band was not created by IHTA 1984, having been present in the preceding succession tax legislation that created Estate Duty and Inheritance Tax's immediate predecessor, Capital Transfer Tax. The amount of the Nil Rate Band has tended to increase over time to so as to keep pace with inflation and with such changes or periods of no change having the effect of reducing or increasing the number of death estates and transfers of value that are subject to the payment of the tax at a rate above 0%. Changes in the amount of the Nil Rate Band are not retrospective, in the sense that they apply to raise the threshold of the Nil Rate Band for transfers occurring on a date after the change occurs. Broadly speaking, Chargeable Lifetime Transfers, deemed transfers (such as that arising at the tenth anniversary of a trust containing Relevant Property as defined by the IHTA 1986), that exceed the Nil Rate Band and chargeable transfers on death that exceed the Nil Rate Band may be liable to IHT at a rate of 20% (for Chargeable Lifetime Transfers) or 40% (for transfers occurring on death). A lower rate of Inheritance Tax (36%) may be charged when the transfers on death are made in part to qualifying charitable beneficiaries and an effective rate of 6% (or a proportion of that amount determined in part by how long the assets have been held in trust) may apply when assets leave a trust or are held in trust after the tenth anniversary of the creation of the trust. It is important to recognise that the Nil Rate Band is treated in the legislation not as an exemption from liability from Inheritance Tax, but instead has the effect of making certain transfers of value liable to tax at a rate of 0%.  The Transferable Nil Rate Band  The Chancellor of the Exchequer's Autumn Statement on 9 October 20072007 Pre-Budget Report and Comprehensive Spending Review: 01 announced that with immediate effect the Nil Rate Band of one spouse or civil partner was to be transferable to the surviving spouse or civil partner. Thus, for the 2007/8 tax year, spouses and civil partners could pass on assets of up to ¬£600,000 without inheritance tax being paid from their estates, whilst a single person could only pass on ¬£300,000. The mechanism by which this was achieved was that on the death of the second spouse to die, the nil rate band threshold applying at the date of the death of the second spouse would be increased by a percentage of the nil-rate band at the date of death of the predeceasing spouse which was not used on their death. For example, if in 2007/08 the first married spouse (or civil partner) to die were to leave ¬£120,000 to their children and the rest of their estate to their spouse, there would be no inheritance tax due at that time and ¬£180,000 or 60% of the nil- rate band would be unused. Later, upon the second death the nil-rate band would be 160% of the allowance for a single person, so that if the surviving spouse also died in 2007/08 the first ¬£480,000 (160% of ¬£300,000) of the surviving spouse's estate would be exempt from inheritance tax. If the surviving spouse died in a later year when the nil-rate band had reached ¬£350,000, the first ¬£560,000 (160% of ¬£350,000) of the estate would be tax exempt. This measure was also extended to existing widows, widowers and bereaved civil partners on 9 October 2007. If their late spouse or partner had not used all of their inheritance tax allowance at the time of the spouse's death, then the unused percentage of that allowance can now be added to the single person's allowance when the surviving spouse or partner dies. This applies irrespective of the date on which the first spouse died, but special rules apply if the surviving spouse remarries. In a judgement following an unsuccessful appeal to a 2006 decision by the European Court of Human Rights, it was held that the above does not apply to siblings living together. The crucial factor in such cases was determined to be the existence of a public undertaking, carrying with it a body of rights and obligations of a contractual nature, rather than the length or supportive nature of the relationship., discussing Prior to this legislative change, the most common means of ensuring that the Nil-Rate Band of a pre-deceasing spouse was utilised was to include a legacy in the predeceasing spouse's will of any unused portion of their Nil Rate Band at death to the trustees of a discretionary trust, with the remaining part of the estate being left either to the surviving spouse absolutely (i.e. not subject to any restrictions) or on trusts which entitled them to benefit from the income of the trust during his or her lifetime. Both wills would typically take substantially the same form so that the trust arose regardless of the order of the deaths of the spouses. The potential beneficiaries of the discretionary trust would typically be the spouse and children and remoter descendants of the couple. This form of will was intended to allow the survivor to benefit from the assets in the trust, but without them being treated as assets of the survivor under UK tax law. Since the Government seeks not to profit from the death of those who gave their lives in military service or died from the results of a wound, injury, or disease associated with that military service, that the estates of such servicemen and women are exempt, totally, from any Inheritance Tax regardless of the value of the estate even if it amounts to millions of pounds. The exemption is transferable to the serviceman's or servicewoman's widow or widower. That they do qualify may be certified by application to the British MOD \\"Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre\\" (JCCC). The JCCC then inform the HMRC of that decision. The exemption does not apply to ex- servicemen or servicewomen who die from causes unrelated to their military service.  Additional nil rate band on main residence  In the summer budget of 2015 a new measure was outlined to reduce the burden of IHT for some estates by providing additional tax-free allowances in cases where the family home passed to direct descendants. This measure, called the Residence Nil-Rate Band (RNRB), came into effect upon the passage of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2015, and provided for the following scheduled amounts:IHTA 1984, ss. 8D-8M, as implemented by the Finance (No. 2) Act 2015, ss. 9-10 :* ¬£100,000 for the 2017-18 tax year :* ¬£125,000 for the 2018-19 tax year :* ¬£150,000 for the 2019-20 tax year :* ¬£175,000 for the 2020-21 tax year :* for subsequent tax years, the amount will be linked to the September‚ÄìSeptember rise in the consumer price index The Finance Act 2016 provided further relief in cases where all or part of the additional band could be lost, where a person had downsized to a less valuable residence or had ceased to own a residence after 8 July 2015 (and before the person has died). This is conditional upon the deceased having left that smaller residence, or assets of equivalent value, to direct descendants.Finance Act 2016, Sch. 15 These are defined as lineal descendants, spouses or civil partners of such lineal descendants, or former spouses or civil partners who have not become anyone else's spouse or civil partner.IHTA 1984, s. 8K The introduction of the RNRB means that a married couple leaving a residence to direct descendants can currently leave up to ¬£900,000 tax-free between them (2018/19 tax year), with this tax-free amount rising to ¬£1 million by April 2020. This tax-free allowance is diminished for estates worth more than ¬£2 million.

In modern times, archakas have been recruited from various communities with lesser regard to caste. Hindu priests are known to perform services often referred to as puja. Priests are identified as pundits or pujaris amongst devotees. Priests were the instigating factor to why ordinary people of Hindu religion became indulged severely in a devotional path. Hindu priests through their extended knowledge of the literature, the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana were able to encourage the Hindu community's devotion to Hindu deities. __TOC__ Responsibilities Their primary responsibility is to conduct daily prayers (puja) at the temple. During Hindu festivals, traditional events such as weddings, the sacred thread ceremony, performance of last rites and special deity ceremonies, priests are called upon to conduct puja's either at the temple or at the location of the event. In order to perform these puja's, the priests are required to have prior skills and knowledge. To be a qualified priest, they must know the required chants (mantras and strotas) fluently in Sanskrit and be familiar with the materials required to perform the puja for various ceremonies and rituals. Pandits from an early age were trained to memorize hymns in order to chant them during rituals and ceremonies without aid. Receiving assistance to remember hymns and chants was frowned upon, and were only expected to recite the hymns through memory.  Required qualifications The required qualification to be a priest is that the person is a Brahmin. But the word Brahmin needs to defined carefully. Here the word Brahmin refers to Brahmin varna. In common usage however, the word Brahmin refers to a group of castes. There is no authority for the notion of the birth based caste system in authoritative Hindu scriptures. Even a person born in a \\"low-caste\\" family can become a Brahmin if he acquires the necessary knowledge and is eligible to be appointed as a priest.http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1358014-can-a-sudra-by-birth- become-a-brahmin-priest-in-a-temple/ In Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2 verse 3 Lord Krishna explains to Arjuna about his duty as a Chatriya and the duty of a bramhin. Daily routine Daily routines of Hindu priests would consist of prayers as much as four to six times per day and perhaps even more. Every morning pandits are in charge of bathing the deity with water and milk, clothing the deity with traditional wear and jewellery. After conducting the rituals, the priest offers food to devotees after it has been presented in front of the god referred to as prasad. Whilst the prasad is being handed out, the priests as well as the devotees engage in singing prayers praising the deity. The priests finally conclude with an aarthi (lighted camphor) shown to the deity and held in the presence of the devotees to receive blessings. A Hindu priest would repeat this routine every day as a part of their responsibility in servicing the god.

Connolly served in Navy for 38 years. Over his career he served in World War II, oversaw the development of a program that later evolved into the United States Naval Test Pilot School, commanded two aircraft carriers, and served as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air Warfare, retiring from that post in 1971. Connolly was instrumental in the development of the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. The plane was named in his honor and for Thomas Hinman Moorer, then Chief of Naval Operations.  Early life  Connolly was born in St. Paul, Minnesota. Most of his childhood was spent in Los Angeles. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1929, he received an appointment for the United States Naval Academy.  Olympics  Connolly competed at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles where he received a bronze medal in rope climbing. This was the fourth and last time this was an Olympic event. There were five competitors in the event.  Naval career  Connolly graduated 52nd out of a class of 435 at the Naval Academy. Following graduation from the Naval Academy in 1933, Connolly was ordered to Naval Air Station Pensacola for flight training, and subsequently received his naval aviator wings. In 1939 he was assigned to conduct post graduate studies in aeronautical engineering at the Naval Academy. He received a master's degree in the subject at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1942. In March 1943, Connolly assumed command of Patrol Squadron 13, at which time they were flying Consolidated PB2Y Coronado aircraft. He remained at that posting until September 1944. During his time in command, the unit saw action at the Gilbert Islands, the Marshall Islands, and bombed Wake Island. While serving in command of this unit, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal, both with two gold stars indicating additional awards. In 1944, Connolly was assigned to Naval Air Station Patuxent River as Assistant Director of Flight Test. He became one of the first 50 USN pilots to pilot a jet plane, flying a YP-59A on February 24, 1945. During his time at Patuxtent, Connolly found that working with multiple personnel from different fields that nobody communicated in the same technical language. As a result, he recommended starting a school within the command to train pilots and engineers to use the same language. This school began operating in 1945. This school became the Test Pilot Training Division, and would later evolve into the United States Navy Test Pilot School. In early 1947, he commenced a tour at sea as executive officer of , completing the tour in September, 1948. Connolly returned to Patuxtent and became the second commander of the Test Pilot School in December 1948. In 1948 while at Patuxtent, he co-authored the textbook \\"Airplane Aerodynamics\\", which became a standard textbook at multiple universities. While in command of the school, he qualified as a helicopter pilot. Connolly remained the commander of the school until April 1951. In June 1951 he assumed command of Heavy Attack Squadron Six (VAH-6), remaining in that post until July 1952. His next posting came that month as the Experimental Officer at the Naval Ordnance Test Station. On August 21, 1957, he assumed command of the aircraft carrier . During his time as commander, Hornet deployed to the Western Pacific in the United States Seventh Fleet area of operations. He remained in command until August 25, 1958. In 1958, he assumed the position of Assistant Chief of the Pacific Missile Range within the Bureau of Aeronautics. It was during this time that he put together a group which came to be known as the \\"Connolly Committee\\". That group's seminal work was \\"The Navy in the Space Age\\". This group's work and recommendations were approved by the Chief of Naval Operations on July 13, 1959, and became pivotal in the development of the Navy Navigation Satellite System, the first system of its kind in the world. Following this posting, Connolly was Commander, Carrier Division Seven. From May 18, 1964 to August 28, 1965 he was Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Fleet Operations and Readiness. During this posting he was the Director of the Combat Consumables Requirement Study (Non-Nuclear Ordnance Study), for which he received the Legion of Merit. On October 30, 1965 he became Commander, Naval Air Forces Pacific in a ceremony held onboard the carrier . On November 1, 1966, he was appointed to the position of Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air Warfare. He remained in that posting until his retirement on August 31, 1971. = Role in F-14 development = During the time of his posting as DCNO for Air Warfare, the Navy was developing the TFX Program. The Navy's version of this replacement for the F4 Phantom II was the General Dynamics‚ÄìGrumman F-111B. As American air operations in the Vietnam War ramped up, the Navy's requirements for the plane evolved to include capabilities for air combat manoeuvring, a task for which the F-111 was not designed. Responding to this, Connolly set out requirements for a replacement naval interceptor. In 1968, during testimony before the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, Connolly was asked by chairman John C. Stennis for his opinion on what would make the F-111B work for naval service. He responded, \\"There isn't enough power in all Christendom to make that airplane what we want!\\". On being contradicted by Secretary of the Navy Paul Ignatius, who referenced a report written by Connolly the prior year that praised the F-111B, Connolly reversed himself. Nevertheless, Connolly's testimony was the death knell for the F-111B project, with it being cancelled in May 1968. Subsequently, Connolly effectively became the F-14 project manager.  Later life  Following retirement, Connolly lived in the McLean, Virginia area until the early 1990s, when he moved to Holland, Michigan. He worked as a consultant on national defense. Connolly died May 24, 1996 in Holland, Michigan from emphysema and an aortic aneurysm at the age of 86. His wife of 58 years passed away April 26, 2010.  Honors  Connolly was awarded Tailhooker Of The Year in 1969 by the Tailhook Association. In 1998 he was inducted into the Naval Aviation Hall of Honor, and in 1999, he was inducted into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame.

It was adapted into a television mini-series starring John Thaw and Lindsay Duncan. Reviewers praised the book's honest style, wit and its refreshing humour. Plot Peter Mayle and his wife move to Provence, and are soon met with unexpectedly fierce weather, underground truffle dealers and unruly workers, who work around their normalement schedule.\\"normalement\\" is often used when they are asked when jobs will be finished; however it is implied that this timing will never be fulfilled. Meals in Proven√ßal restaurants and work on the Mayles' house, garden and vineyard are features of the book, whose chapters follow the months of the year. Adaptations In 1991 a radio adaptation was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. In 1993, the BBC produced a television miniseries based on the book, starring Lindsay Duncan and John Thaw, with appearances from Alfred Molina and James Fleet. Unlike the book, the programme was not well received by critics and it was later placed at number ten on a Radio Times list of the worst television programmes ever made with John Naughton, describing it as a \\"smugathon ... which achieved the near impossible ‚Äì creating a John Thaw vehicle nobody liked\\".

He founded the company in 1913 and was its leader until his death. Background Aicher was born in a small village in southern Styria in Austria. His talent for carving was recognised at an early age and he was sent to study with the well known maker of altar pieces. His interest in figures in motion took him to Munich to one of the masters of puppetry Papa Schmid Salzburg Marionetten Theater, p.30 Influences One of the greatest influences on Aicher was the work of Count Franz Pocci, founder of the Munich Marionette Theatre.Logan, D, Puppetry, p.10 Salzburg Marionette Theatre In 1913, Aicher founded the Salzburg Marionette Theatre.Logan, D, Puppetry, p.11 The company opened on 27 February 1913 with a production of Mozart's opera, Bastien and Bastienne . In October of the same year, Aicher hired the gymnasium of the Borromaeum seminary and installed his company there. The venue was the home of the Salzburg Marionette Theatre for 49 years.Salzburg Marionetten Theater, p.17 World War I did not interrupt the workings of the theatre company. In 1926, Aicher handed over the management of the theatre to his son, Hermann Aicher. 1927 saw the first tour of the company to Hamburg, Germany. This tour started a tradition that still continues today. Legacy Professor Anton Aicher's company continues to flourish today under the artistic direction of his granddaughter, Gretl Aicher.

The title page states that it is an abridgement of the author's larger work, but it should be seen as a shorter re-write, dealing in considerable depth with public meetings outside and separate from the Parliament in Ottawa. The fourth, posthumous, edition of the work was given the cover title of the present article. The document is widely used in Canada to set procedures for formal meetings in government, companies and other organizations.

This was the first printing to use Rules of Order in the title. *1918, fourth reprint, viii, 208 pages The 1924 printing by McClelland & Stewart has the identical text and pagination, with minor changes to the numbering of the preliminary leaves, as the 4th printing, but Bourinot's name is added to the cover title as Bourinot's Rules of Order, most probably in response to the American publication Robert's Rules of Order. *1924, Rules of Order: Being a Canadian Manual on the Procedure at Meetings of Shareholders and Directors of Companies, Conventions, Societies and Public Assemblies Generally, iv, [2], 208. Bourinot's larger work, Parliamentary procedure and practice; with a review of the origin, growth and operation of parliamentary institution in the Dominion of Canada, and an appendix, containing the British North America act of 1867 and amending acts from which this was derived was first published in 1884 in Montreal by Dawson Brothers, with further editions in 1892, 1903, and 1916.

Built in 1960, The Torch of Friendship was built to signify the passageway for immigrants coming from Latin America and the Caribbean. The gas fed flame was meant to act as a welcoming beacon for all new and old immigrants to the nation. In 1964 it was re-dedicated to the memory of the American president John F. Kennedy. History In August 1960, the Miami City Commission, acting on a suggestion by then city manager Melvin L. Reese for the erection of a ‚ÄúTorch of Friendship‚Äù in Bayfront Park, voted to begin construction of the torch in the park as a monument to the city‚Äôs ‚Äúperpetual friendship‚Äù with Latin America. ‚ÄúThe Torch will be a new step in emphasizing our friendship with our Latin friends,‚Äù announced Robert King High, Miami‚Äôs mayor. High had already seen tens of thousands of Cuban refugees enter the city fleeing the Cuban Revolution. The Torch, he said, would ‚Äúshow that Miami is more than a geographical Gateway to the Americas. It is a symbol of wealth and cordiality. We hope it will have the significance that the Statue of Liberty now has.‚Äù Reese presented a drawing of a concrete shaft topped by a continually burning flame, surrounded by a keystone patio. He explained that a wraparound wall would contain seals of each Latin American country. The completed Torch of Friendship was dedicated in October 1960. Sadly, three years later, President Kennedy was assassinated, and in 1964, the Torch was dedicated in his honor. Description It consists of a pillar, covered with stone plates and topped by a burning torch. It holds a plate with the Great Seal of the United States at the front. Underneath a plate holds a caption in which the city of Miami dedicates this monument to the friendship between the USA and the Latin American countries. It also has the year of construction, 1960. The pilar is escorted by a curved wall in which appears the re-dedication of the monument, in memory of John F. Kennedy. To its right, the words TORCH OF FRIENDSHIP appear above 20 round plates showing the coat of arms and names of the following Latin American and Caribbean countries: There's a space between the plates of Costa Rica and Dominican Republic. Because of the alphabetical order, the missing place must have been for Cuba.

It runs from 8-11 am on Saturday and Sunday, and is presented by Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie. The show originally ran on BBC Radio 2 from 16 April 2007 until 23 March 2011, where it was known as The Radcliffe and Maconie Show. Originally broadcast on weekday afternoons, the current 6 Music show broadcasts from the BBC's MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester. The duo celebrated the 10th anniversary of the show and broadcasting together on 17 April 2017. The show moved to the weekend breakfast slot in January 2019. History Mark Radcliffe had previously broadcast a solo show on Radio 2 from June 2004 after transferring from BBC Radio 1 the previous March, whilst Maconie had also broadcast various shows for the network as well as 6 Music. The Radio 2 show was broadcast four nights a week (Monday to Thursday) until 8 April 2010, when the Thursday night show was given over to In Concert, a music programme featuring repeats of old live concerts. This was carried out as a response to the BBC Trust, who dictated that Radio 2 must feature more live music. Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan made the decision to cut one of Radcliffe & Maconie's shows in order to make way for the repeats featured within 'In Concert'. On 1 February 2011 it was announced that the pair were to move to BBC Radio 6 Music to present a weekday show, starting on 4 April. The final show on Radio 2 was broadcast on 23 March and featured live music from Manic Street Preachers. The BBC Radio 6 Music weekday show ran from 4 April 2011 until 21 December 2018. Radcliffe took a break from broadcasting in early October 2018 after he had announced he was receiving treatment for cancer. The final weekday show was presented by Maconie only, although Radcliffe made a short appearance announcing that he would be returning in February 2019 to re-join Maconie on the new weekend breakfast show which began on 12 January. The show plays new music by up and coming artists as well as established acts. It also features live sessions from a diverse collection of acts. Bands and artists that have featured in session in the past include; The Raveonettes, Arcade Fire, Crowded House, Sheryl Crow, Supergrass, Elbow, Seasick Steve, Siouxsie Sioux, The Flies, Vashti Bunyan, Kate Walsh, Ed Harcourt, The Earlies, Maps, Laura Veirs, Feist, Editors, Travis, Cherry Ghost, The Coral, The Thrills, Tinariwen as well as many more. Radcliffe and Maconie have also made comment on the show from time to time of their appreciation of cowbells and various kinds of cheese. Whenever Radcliffe is presenting the show, either with Maconie or by himself, it usually begins with the line \\"You know what you wanna do with that, right? You wanna put a bangin' donk on it.\\" sampled from the song \\"Put A Donk On It\\" by The Blackout Crew. If Maconie is presenting solo, he usually does not include this in the show. The show typically begins with an older, classic \\"bangin' donk\\" tune, followed by a short instrumental, novelty, or television theme song (such as the theme to Barnaby or \\"Popcorn\\" by Hot Butter), followed by a contemporary song. Following this opening set of songs is the show's 'bed' track, an instrumental mix of \\"Chicken Payback\\" by The Bees, over which the hosts begin the show. Another sample played regularly on the show is the \\"Roots Bloody Roots\\" clip. Taken from listener and contributor, Gayton Peawell from Darlington. His suggestion of \\"Roots Bloody Roots\\" by Sepultura was performed with a deepened voice. Elizabeth 'Alcopops' Alker has been the music news reporter on the show since it moved to 6 Music in 2011. Special guests often appear on Radcliffe & Maconie. Among the regular guests are Noddy Holder, Sally Lindsay, Adrian Edmondson, Miranda Sawyer and Lucy Porter. Current features =The Chain= The Chain is an item on the show billed as a 'never-ending list of records, with every new track somehow connected to the last.' One song is played in every hour of each show that relates to the previous one, listeners are encouraged to contact the show with another song that links to this one. The connection can be anything, ranging from the very obvious to the very obscure. The item is introduced by Gordon Burns. On 4 January 2011 Burns joined the show to celebrate the 2,000th link, which was \\"Fame\\" by David Bowie. He joined the show again on 9 October 2013 for the 4,000th link which was \\"Dear Prudence\\" by the Beatles, the date coincidentally being John Lennon's birthday. A website is available for listeners to check if a chain suggestion they want to make has been on before as each song can only be used once. The website is run and maintained by regular contributor to the show Kenneth Ken Yau. The theme song for the segment is the Fleetwood Mac song it is named after, which was also the very first link. =Tea Time Theme Time= Every Sunday at about 9:35am, three records are played that all centre round a particular theme. When the show was on weekdays it would be every day at about 3:35pm. The first week's themes were chosen by the presenters themselves, after which the themes were chosen by listeners. At first the linking theme was announced before the records were played, however it soon became popular for listeners to guess what the link was so now the connecting theme isn't mentioned until all the records have been played and listeners contact the show with their guesses as to what the theme is. Although there is no prize for getting the theme correct the first person to contact the show with the correct answer has the honour of having their name mentioned as the winner. Radcliffe and Maconie used to say that the first correct answer received the \\"Tea Time Theme Time Crown of Joy.\\" Although the winner didn't receive an actual crown, a picture of a paper hat representing a crown would be tweeted along with the winners name. However they no longer refer to the \\"Tea Time Theme Time Crown of Joy.\\" Previous features =The Miracle of Pick 'n' Mix= Every day on the Radio 2 show, Radcliffe and Maconie would take it in turns to choose a new track on the Pick 'n' Mix feature, usually by a less well known artist. At the end of the week listeners were encouraged to vote on the Radio 2 website for their favourite. The track with the most votes would then be played on every show the following week. After an impromptu moment on the show's Hadrians Wall tour, the feature was rechristened \\"The Miracle of Pick 'n' Mix\\". =Walking Outside Broadcasts= Between 3 and 10 September 2009, the show was broadcast live from different locations along the Hadrian's Wall trail, as Radcliffe and Maconie walked between the Solway Firth, the BBC studios in Carlisle and Segedunum in Wallsend, Newcastle upon Tyne. In September 2010 Radcliffe and Maconie broadcast from locations along the Jurassic Coast including Exmouth, Weymouth, Lyme Regis and Sidmouth. They now, occasionally, refer to themselves as \\"The Beery Hikers\\", a play on The Hairy Bikers. =The Fleetwood Mac Game= The winner of the Fleetwood Mac game will typically be announced during the first hour of the show. The myriad intricate rules have not been repeated in full since its inception in September 2014. On 16 October 2014 this was won by the music news presenter, SJ, marking the first time the winner had been related to the show or 6 Music.

Part I is a 200-item test with four subdivisions, which are on Verbal, Inductive Reasoning, Quantitative and Perceptual Acuity Skills and is a three-hour exam. Part II is a two- hour-30-minute test in the field of basic sciences such as Biology, Physics, Social Sciences and Chemistry, all of which form 200 items. Qualified test takers are graduates and graduating students of degree programs. So that is 5 hours and 30 minutes exam in a day.

It originally aired on March 17, 2008. It was the first episode to air after the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike concluded.  Plot  Ted, Marshall and Lily decide to spend Saint Patrick's Day holding a board game night at Marshall and Lily's new apartment, rather than drinking green beer with a green-suited Barney. Barney, although insulted, accepts his fate and leaves alone. Soon after, Barney calls Ted, having procured a cab and two hot dates for the night. He proposes his theory of \\"No Tomorrow\\" and that \\"today\\" will have no consequences, and finally convinces Ted to join him by promising him one of his dates. Future Ted reveals that the Mother was present at the party that he and Barney attended that night. Back at board game night, Marshall and Robin discover that Marshall and Lily's new apartment is crooked. Marshall convinces Robin to keep it a secret from Lily, at least for the time being. However, when a painting on the wall suddenly moves, Lily senses something weird. To cover the truth, Marshall concocts a story about the ghost of a Confederate general haunting the apartment. Eventually, the secret comes out and Marshall, Lily and Robin end up inventing a game called \\"roller luge\\" as a means of getting over the crooked floor. Marshall and Lily then move back in with Ted while their apartment is being renovated. Meanwhile, out with Barney, Ted discovers that, for one night only, the universe seems to work in reverse and rewards him for every bad deed he does. He ditched Marshall and Lily and found himself with a hot date, then he and Barney ditched their dates in line outside a nightclub, and inside they found themselves outnumbered by hotter or equally hot women. He puts two expensive bottles of champagne on someone else's tab, and is presented with free caviar. The biggest reward comes when he gets hit on by a sure thing named Ashlee (Vanessa Minnillo). To test his theory he asks Ashlee if she would have a one-night stand with him and then forget about it entirely the next morning, to which she agrees, thus confirming his theory. Then, Ashlee confides in him that she is married, which fills him with panic and guilt. Barney approves of Ted's actions but disapproves of his reluctance to proceed. Back with Ashlee, Ted hesitates and then gets punched out by the man whose tab he had used. Ted wakes up at home the next morning with a black eye and fond memories, telling Marshall that after police arrested the man he got to drink for free for the rest of the night. However, Marshall is far from impressed and reminds Ted that he committed credit card fraud and kissed a married woman. To further the point, he reveals that Ted had accidentally pocket dialled his phone the whole time. Seventeen voice messages are played and remind Ted of how he abandoned his date at the door, ordered champagne on a stranger's bar tab and wanted to have sex with a woman with no intention of seeing her again (all while extremely drunk). Ashamed of his behavior, Ted thanks Marshall for confronting him with the hard truth. Ted returns to the club to retrieve his phone, which he had left behind. He doesn't find it, but he grabs an abandoned yellow umbrella and walks home in the rain. Future Ted reveals that his eventual wife had been at the club that night, but they did not meet and he's glad because he knows that if they had, she would not have liked him. In the last scene, Barney wakes up next to a dumpster, proclaims, \\"I'm awesome\\" and stumbles away.  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode B+. Rating B+ Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 8 out of 10. Several critics speculated on whether actress Nicole Muirbrook, who is credited as \\"Woman\\" in the episode, could be the titular Mother. Joel Keller of TV Squad described the episode as \\"above average\\" and wondered if the show would survive to be renewed for a fourth season. The article also included a poll asking if the woman Ted ran into was the mother or a red herring thrown in by the writers. Omar of Television Without Pity rated the episode with a grade B. This is the second most watched episode of season 3.

Through sideband computing method, any network server which has a lot of clients can form into a large-scale super- computing network. During this process, the resources in the clients could be utilized through the central server so long as the main channel is maintained. Sideband computing is related to the distributed computing and multiple communication channels. Generally, the task could be any task that is performed by individual client and used in the various distributed computing environment such as social computing, volunteer computing, and edge computing, grid computing, or utility computing. Collaborative task in social computing is one example. Sideband computing is also a type of super computing where each client carries out some real computation tasks that could be the individually executed. With the server aggregating the results from each client, it effectively achieves the function of a real super-computer. History  Sideband computing is first coined by Yongyong Xu in a paper titled ‚ÄúGlobal Sideband Service Distributed Computing Method‚Äù on a conference ‚ÄúCommunication Networks and Distributed System Modeling and Simulation (CNDS‚Äô98) on January 1998. In this paper, a fractal image distributed task was implemented as a demo to the power of distributed computing.  Advantage  Sideband computing maximizes the participation and involvement of clients who are connecting with the server so that every client could help to contribute. With little cost, the network server can act as a supercomputer. Most other distributed computing requires each client to manually install client side software, proactively participate in the computing and the computation is the sole objective of such client side software. With sideband computing, sideband service stays along with a regular network service, which allows the sideband services being served without much interrupting to the main network service that is less intrusive and more user-friendly to the end user. On a different view, a client can be viewed as paying its ‚Äúcontributing‚Äù in exchange of the regular service it is served. This is similar to volunteer computing  Disadvantage  Sideband computing requires a regular network service being performed beforehand. Without the main network service, it is not called sideband method.  Applicable fields  Ajax and Web 2.0 are claimed to be one of the area where sideband method is used. It is said that Ajax is conducted through asynchronously though additional channel other than a browser-server‚Äôs main HTTP channel. Examples of sideband computing in this sense include collaborative filtering, online auctions, online ranking, mashing up, prediction markets, reputation systems, computational social choice, tagging, and verification games using Ajax. A typical setup would involve that the server allows each client to do a small amount of work and the server coordinates and aggregates results every client to form a larger picture. For instance, when sideband computing applies to the social computing based on each client creating or recreating social conventions and social contexts through the use of client‚Äôs computing resource, software and technology. Many social networking services, which utilize The Wisdom of Crowds, such as Wikis, social bookmaking, blogging, instant messaging, online bidding, and other kinds of electronic market or electronic negotiation platforms where people interact socially, could found the trace of sideband method.

The founding members of the band, then students at the University of Illinois, were MC CZAR Absolute, drummer Farsheed Hamidi-Toosi, DJ Spinnerty, keyboardist Artur Wnorowski, guitarist Steven Dobias and bassist Prashant Vallury. In July 2004 DJ Spinnerty and Hamidi-Toosi left the band and were replaced by Michael \\"DJ Mabbo\\" Mabborang and Brian Derstine. During October 2007 the band completed their first international tour performing at US Military Installations in Honduras and Cuba (including Guantanamo Bay Naval Base) with Armed Forces Entertainment.Harding, C: \\"Base Gratitude\\", Billboard, December 1, 2007. The band has been featured in major newspapers in the Midwest as well as featured in Billboard Magazine. Their debut album \\"Riding In Fast Cars With Your Momma,\\"[ allmusic ((( Riding in Fast Cars with Your Momma > Overview )))] debuted on the CMJ Hip-Hop Adds radio chart at #2 on November 14, 2007. History In 2003 CZAR, Hamidi-Toosi, Spinnerty, Wnorowski and Vallury were amongst the charter members of the Urbana-Champaign chapter of the Hip-Hop Congress. The current members Vallury, Steven Dobias, drummer Brian Derstine and DJ Mabbo were all members of the now defunct Chicago-based hip-hop band Peoples of Paradox. Animate Objects was born out of a performance request. CZAR Absolute was asked to participate in the 2003 Triangle Fraternity Battle of the Bands at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Since CZAR was a solo artist at the time he needed to put together a band in order to compete. CZAR approached Larry Gates, of the defunct Urbana-based rock band Lorenzo Goetz, in order to find a guitar player. Gates, who knew of Peoples of Paradox, suggested Vallury who was then a clerk at the independent music store Record Service. Vallury in turn referred Dobias and both were asked to come to an impromptu practice session later that night. On September 13, 2003, after only two practices and two weeks of preparation time Animate Objects took the stage for the first time and won the Battle of the Bands. =2003 - 2004= The local press was quick to praise the band and they soon had a series of local shows lined up. The band‚Äôs third gig was opening for Illogic, DJ PRZM, the Opus and Soul Position (RJD2 + Blueprint). After this early series of shows the original members got together to decide whether or not they wanted to continue performing. The band decided to stay together and record an album. Heading into 2004 the band applied to Green Street Records, also known by the acronym GSR, to have a song included on the label's first compilation CD release entitled \\"Emergence\\".Green St. Records: Albums Animate Objects were accepted and their song 'Flipcut', later re-recorded as 'Riding In Fast Cars With Your Momma', became track #1 on Emergence. 'Flipcut' was the band's first foray into a studio recording environment and their first time working with Pogo Studio head Mark Rubel who would later engineer much of the band's debut record. =2004 - 2006= The band performed a set at the 2004 University of Illinois Band Jam. A rainy day made conditions on the stage difficult but a large crowd witnessed what would be one of the band‚Äôs final performances as a Champaign-based artist. In June 2004 the bulk of the band graduated from the University of Illinois. CZAR, Dobias and Vallury moved to Chicago. A-Dub remained in Champaign to complete his degree at the University of Illinois while Hamidi-Toosi and Spinnerty left the band to pursue solo music projects. The band reached out to Peoples of Paradox members Brian Derstine and DJ Mabbo to fill the roles of drummer and DJ an so fused the two acts together. The first show with the new line‚Äìup was an open mic showcase at the Ice Factory which is a commune for slam poets and underground musicians. In 2005 the band was nominated for the first ever Champaign-Urbana WPGU-Buzz Local Music Award for Best Hip-Hop band despite leaving town several months earlier. They won the award becoming the first group to hold the \\"Best Hip-Hop Band\\" trophy in Champaign. Throughout 2005 and 2006 the band continued to refine their live performance playing shows at several Chicago venues while continuing to record material for their debut record. =2007= On March 31, 2007, the band released their debut album 'Riding in Fast Cars With Your Momma' at Subterranean performing with fellow Chicago hip hop band Berto Ramon and New York's Jneiro Jarel.Jakubiak, D: \\"Jarel at home as multiple-personality performer\\", Chicago Sun Times, March 30, 2007. The record, which took four years to make, marked a watershed moment in the band‚Äôs history. The record has received critical acclaim worldwide. In October 2007 the band embarked on their first international tour. Shows in Cuba and Honduras as part of an Armed Forces Entertainment (AFE) tour introduced the band to a new fan base and gave them publicity. The tour led to the band gracing the cover of AFE's Cadence Magazine. In November 2007 the band‚Äôs record debuted at #2 on the CMJ (College Music Journal) Hip-Hop Adds Chart, placing the record in rotation at nearly 200 radio stations across the country. At the close of 2007 Animate Objects received their first major independent award winning 'Best Hip-Hop Song' in the 2008 Independent Music Awards for the song El Dorado. =2008= In March 2008 Animate Objects released their first music video for El Dorado. The release of the music video would lead to exposure for the band - resulting in several endorsement deals. Bassist Prashant Vallury would secure an endorsement deal from cabinet manufacturer Accugroove, bass amplifier manufacturer Thunderfunk, and clothing brand DesiThreads. Pianist A-Dub would also receive an endorsement from Thunderfunk Amplification. Guitarist Steven Dobias received an endorsement from Stromberg Guitars. and both Prashant Vallury and Steven Dobias would also add endorsements from Native Instruments. Winners of the 7th annual Independent Music Awards Vox Pop vote for best Rap/Hip-Hop Song \\"El Dorado\\" In October 2008 the band headlined a showcase at the 2008 CMJ Music Marathon at Kenny's Castaways. The showcase featured several songs off their E.P. 'Dubs, Grunts and Things'. =2009= On January 8, 2009, the band officially released 'Dubs, Grunts and Things', their second album. The album was the first recording to feature their new MC Aquil and features some of their last recordings with drummer Brian Derstine who had left the band a few months earlier. 2009 would see the band embark on a nationwide tour with shows ranging from California to Maine. This tour would feature a new drummer in Danya Thompson, and touring keyboardist Damian Williams. The band would spend the second half of the year preparing new material that would form the basis of its second full-length album. Thompson, Vallury, and Dobias also formed a production team named \\"Danya and the Fail\\", and began to write new material for this side project. =2010= In 2010 the band co-headlined the US Army's \\"I.A.M. Strong\\" tour with Universal singer Leigh Jones. The tour spanned across the continental United States and stopped at bases abroad in Germany and Italy. Following the tour the band parted ways with drummer Danya Thompson, bringing on Justin Boyd of the defunct Chicago- based group Treologic. Additionally they welcomed Charles Coffeen to their permanent lineup, with Coffeen playing keys. Danya and the Fail released a mixtape through the band, the mixtape \\"The Shit\\" and PV Wonder released the EP \\"Dubs, Grunts, and Remixes\\". These releases featured the MCs from Animate Objects, as well as singer Marga Marion and emcee Rico Sisney of Sidewalk Chalk.

It opened in June 1990 as Liberty 2. From 2006 to August 2010 it was owned by The Mall Fund and was known as The Mall Romford.http://www.themall.co.uk/my-mall/Romford/category- directory.aspxThe Mall Romford web site message It is‚Äîalong with The Liberty and The Brewery‚Äîone of the three main shopping centres in Romford. History The Liberty 2 opened with a mix of retail and leisure tenants, although these were spatially separated with the shops on the first two levels and the nightclub, cinema and bingo hall on the third floor. The name referred to existing Liberty Shopping Centre. It was initially anchored by a Sainsbury's supermarket, but when this relocated to The Brewery elsewhere in the town centre, the former supermarket space in the mall was taken by Wilkinson. In 2001 shortly after the opening of The Brewery the Odeon Cinema closed, but reopened in 2012 as Premiere Cinemas which was then the cheapest multiplex cinema in the UK.http://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/news/uk_s_cheapest_multiplex_premiere_cinema_in_romford_celebrates_first_50_000_visitors_1_1521955 In 2006 the Liberty 2 was expanded with the redevelopment of the adjacent former Dolphin Centre to form part of the retail site. The redevelopment included the development of a new anchor store, an Asda supermarket, which was also linked into the mall at level two. The redevelopment also saw a housing block above the supermarket site. As part of the revamp, the centre - which had previously still been heavily carrying the 'Liberty 2' branding - was rebranded under The Mall Fund's corporate identity. The Mercury has been used as a filming location; for instance, it was featured in the Reebok \\"Belly's gonna getcha!\\" television advertisement. In the advert one can clearly see The Mercury's lifts.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGvDwKInmUw The centre is also frequently used in hidden camera TV shows Bad Robot's and Off Their Rockers. In 2011 the centre was sold to Rockspring UK and The Other Retail Group as part of a package of centres from The Mall Fund, the centre was then rebranded The Mercury Mall.http://shopping- centre.co.uk/news/archivestory.php/aid/4440/Rockspring_and_The_Other_Retail_Group_welcome_new_anchor_tenants.html In 2013 The Mercury Mall became the backdrop for the horror movie Death Walks.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3020786/http://www.romfordrecorder.co.uk/news/spencer_hawken_prepares_to_turn_mercury_mall_romford_into_the_set_of_a_horror_film_literally_1_2256129 In 2014 Rockspring announced it was to sell its raft of shopping centres,http://shopping- centre.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/7558/Rockspring_to_sell__A3265m_of_UK_shopping_centres.html these centres were sold to Ellandi and Lone Star.http://www.ellandi.com/Blog/Ellandi-Press-Releases/2014/12/Ellandi-Tames- The-Tiger/#.Vw94W3rw_WE Since 2017 the Mercury has been the home of Romford Film Festival, showing movies over 5 to 6 days at the centres Premiere Cinema during the months of May or June.http://www.romfordfilmfestival.com Layout The Mercury is separated from the adjacent The Liberty shopping centre at ground level by the Romford ring road, but is connected to it by an underground section of the shopping mall, accessed from the lower level, which leads up into The Liberty. Although the two centres are connected physically in this way, they are independently owned and are run separately from one another. It comprises two levels of retail stores, and a third level which includes a Mecca bingo hall and, since late 2012, the independently run Premiere Cinemas & Stages Dance Studio since 2013. There is a forth level which used to be the home of Pulse Nightclub, which closed in 1999. The centre is iconic in Romford due to its glass dome enclosure, which is represented frequently in local art and illustration.https://www.instagram.com/p/0ya37EyheB/ Other stores and services in The Mercury include McDonald's, GAME, Blue Inc and Peacocks.

Both nations enjoy friendly relations, the importance of which centers on the history of German migration to Paraguay. Approximately 300,000 Paraguayans claim German origin.Establecar√°n Nueva Colonia de alemanes en Paraguay (in Spanish) Both nations are members of the United Nations. History German migrants in Hohenau, Paraguay, 1912. Paraguay established diplomatic relations with Prussia in 1860.Geschichtlicher √úberblick (in German) In the aftermath of the War of the Triple Alliance between Paraguay and its neighbors, Paraguay lost up to 69% of its population, mostly due to illness, hunger and physical exhaustion, of which 90% were male. As a result, Paraguay took steps to promote immigration to the country.German Immigration and Adaptation to Latin America (page 47) Several communities from Europe and Asia took initiative to settle in Paraguay. One of the first groups were a group of Germans led by Bernhard F√∂rster and Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche (the sister of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche) who came to Paraguay in 1887 with 14 German families to establish and create a model community in the New World and to demonstrate the supremacy of German culture and society.German Outpost Born of Racism in 1887 Blends Into Paraguay The settlement they established was called Nueva Germania. The settlement did not last and several people from the settlement returned to Germany, but many stayed and their descendants remain in Paraguay today. Later, groups of Mennonites arrived in Paraguay and settled in its Gran Chaco region. In 1922, Germany opened a diplomatic legation in Asunci√≥n. Between the two World Wars there were several more waves of German immigration to the country. During World War II, Paraguay was initially in favor of the Axis powers, but, due to international pressure, Paraguay declared war on the Axis powers in February 1945. During the war, Paraguay was a major hotspot for German espionage during Operation Bol√≠var. After the war Paraguay received many Nazis to the country escaping capture and trial. Notable Nazis such as Eduard Roschmann and Josef Mengele moved to Paraguay. In 1959, Josef Mengele became a naturalized citizen of Paraguay and resided in Hohenau, Paraguay near the Argentine border.Mengele Hunt Focuses on Paraguay In 1954, West Germany opened an embassy in Asunci√≥n. That same year, Alfredo Stroessner became President of Paraguay. Stroessner was of German origin on his father‚Äôs side and ruled Paraguay for 35 years. His time in office became known as El Stronato. Stroessner kept close political ties with West Germany and paid several visits to the country, but relations between West Germany and Stroessner soured when the West German government pressured him to stop sheltering Nazi war criminals in Paraguay.Paraguayan Puts off Bonn Visit In 1964, the West German government asked Stroessner to extradite Mengele but Stroessner angrily refused and would not strip him of his citizenship either.An awkward friendship blossoms between Jerusalem and Asunci√≥n In February 1989, Stroessner was ousted from power and relations between West Germany and Paraguay resumed once again. After the reunification of Germany Germany continued to assist Paraguay on the road to democracy, and with investigations into human rights violations committed during the Stroessner dictatorship.Paraguay: Bilateral Relations The German development agency, GIZ, has carried out several development-related projects in Paraguay. Furthermore, leaders of both nations have met on numerous occasions and have signed several bilateral agreements. In May 2019, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Castiglioni visited Germany and met German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. During his visit, Foreign Minister Castiglioni asked for continued German support in strengthening the rule of law, scholarships programs for specializations and assistance in fighting deforestation and climate change in Paraguay.Paraguay y Alemania se comprometen a fortalecer institucionalidad, aumentar becas y combatir la deforestaci√≥n (in Spanish) Trade In 2019, trade between both nations totaled ‚Ç¨270 million.

Life Shawn Matthew Fogel was born on December 12, 1981, in New York State. He began learning how to play music as a young child, picking up the piano in third grade. He continued to learn various other instruments through middle and high school, after which he enrolled in Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he studied songwriting, performance, audio engineering & studio recording, and music business. During his senior year at Hampshire, Fogel used the campus facilities to record, edit, and mix his first full- length album, Millions of Miles Away, all on his own. The album was released commercially in 2004. Fogel's next effort, One Day In The Desert - EP, was recorded with the record label The Sleepy West and released in late 2007. An accomplished multi-instrumentalist, Fogel sang all of the vocals and played all of the instruments on both albums; his talents cover a wide range of instruments, including the guitar, bass guitar, keyboard, harmonica, clarinet, saxophone, and drums. Fogel also performs with The LeeVees, a New York City rock band that plays contemporary Hanukkah songs for whom Fogel plays bass guitar. Like the rest of the band members, Fogel maintains a strong Jewish identity, as he is also a songleader for the Garden Empire Region (GER) of the North American Federation of Temple Youths (NFTY). Fogel is also a member of the world's only all hockey rock band The Zambonis. The Zambonis formed in 1991. Fogel joined in 2006. Fogel claims his influences to be his mother's old Beatles LP's and Stevie Wonder, the latter of whom was specifically his inspiration to record his music in a one-man-band fashion. Discography Fogel has recorded four albums, the first two of which are out of print.

Musically it is unconventional, as after the B section when most popular songs return to A, this song has an A-B-C-A1 structure. Carmichael recorded the song in 1929, 1930, and 1956. Mildred Bailey made it famous by using it as her theme song. Like other 1920s standards, \\"Rockin' Chair\\" relied on the stereotypes of minstrelsy, citing \\"Aunt Harriet\\" from the anti-Uncle Tom song \\"Aunt Harriet Becha Stowe\\" (1853). The song was first recorded on February 19, 1929 by Hoagy Carmichael as a test for Victor Records, but not released at the time. This recording was later released on the Historical label as HLA-37. This version is sung by only one vocalist. Hoagy Carmichael and his Orchestra recorded a new version on May 21, 1930 featuring Bix Beiderbecke on cornet. This second version is with two vocalists (Carmichael and Irving Brodsky) and was released on Victor Records as V-38139B. Louis Armstrong recorded it with Hoagy Carmichael on vocals on December 13, 1929 at Okeh studios after the stock market crashed, giving a badly needed boost to Carmichael's finances. The recording was released as Okeh 8756 in 1930 and became popular in 1932. The song utilises \\"call and response\\" to create a dialog between an aged father and his son. Armstrong performed and recorded \\"Rockin' Chair\\" numerous times in his career with his trombonist Jack Teagarden.80 Years of Rockin' Chair: http://dippermouth.blogspot.com/2009/12/80-years-of-rockin-chair.html Armstrong's recording history with the song includes a recording from as late as 1971. Mildred Bailey first recorded the song on August 18, 1932 for Bluebird Records (catalog No. 6945), and later for Vocalion Records (catalog No. 3553). The latter recording was a hit in 1937. She became known as The Rockin' Chair Lady. Other popular versions in 1932 were by The Mills Brothers, and by Louis Armstrong with Hoagy Carmichael.

Rett is famous for his research on neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly for his description of Rett syndrome, which was named after him, and for pioneering treatment based on the belief that disabled children also have a right to fulfillment of their physical, emotional, and psychological needs. He received many awards, including the Grand Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria. Biography Andreas Rett went to school in Innsbruck. His father owned a cleaning services company and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps, but Andreas Rett instead chose to study medicine, resulting in his father disinheriting him. He graduated as a physician in 1949. He then trained in paediatrics, and in 1955 he was appointed head of the facility for children with Down Syndrome at a home for the aged in Lainz, Vienna. In 1963 he built up a factory, in which neurologically sick youngsters could work. His belief was that disabled children also do have a right to fulfillment of their physical, emotional, and psychological needs. Rett's academic career began in 1967, when he was appointed as lecturer in neurology and pediatrics at the University of Vienna, in 1973 being promoted to the rank of associate professor. In 1966 he published the first description of Rett syndrome.International Rett Syndrome Foundation History of Rett Syndrome From 1967 he was also head of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Research in Brain Disordered Children. He has published more than 250 articles. Membership in Nazi Party After Rett's death, he received criticism for having been listed as a member of the Hitler Jugend and the Nazi Party as a child and young adult. Andreas Rett was nine years old when the Nazis came to power in Germany and 21 years old at the time of the regime's demise. In recent years he has also been criticized for using research data derived from the Nazi program of Action T4, which was the name given to the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of people, including of children, under the guise of medical euthanasia. Although there is no evidence Rett was directly involved in Action T4, his membership in the Nazi party is notable given that other wartime figures whose history has come under re-examination, such as Austrian physician Hans Asperger, never joined the party. 300px Decorations and awards * 1958: Karl Renner Prize * 1976: Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class * 1982: Paracelsus Ring of Villach * 1988: City of Vienna Prize for Medical Sciences * 1989: Grand Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria * 2002: Andreas Rett Park in Hietzing (Vienna) Notes D.

Villarreal was born in 1924 in Los Angeles, California, to migrant Mexican farmworkers.Villarreal,Jos√© Antonio. \\"About the Author\\" Pocho. Doubleday, 1989. Like Juan Manuel Rubio in Pocho, Villarreal's father fought with Pancho Villa in the Mexican Revolution.Jose Antonio Villarreal He spent four years in the Navy before attending the University of California at Berkeley in 1950.\\"Villarreal. \\"About the Author\\" Pocho Villarreal's novel Pocho (1959) is one of the first Chicano novels, and the first to gain widespread recognition. Pocho has been called the \\"pivotal transitional link between 'Mexican American' and 'Chicano' literature\\", both because of its strengths as a novel and because of its use in the rediscovery and recuperation of Latino literature in the 1970s. The novel details the childhood of Richard Rubio, whose father Juan Manuel left Mexico in the post- Revolution exodus of 1910. As a first-generation American, Richard struggles with the conflicting values of his parents: his father's Mexican sense of honor, tradition, pride and masculinity and the more Americanized view of family and women's roles that his mother and especially his sisters adopt. Richard's father harbors a dream to return his family to Mexico, but his circumstances and choices keep him in the United States. Similarly, Richard does well in school and wants to go to college to become a writer, but he must become the man of the house after his father leaves the family; yet Richard himself leaves the family to join the Navy after Pearl Harbor. According to scholar Francisco A. Lomel√≠, the novel argues \\"that people of Mexican descent have a rightful place they can claim their own that is both Mexican and Anglo American, which Chicanos synthesize in varying degrees [and] accentuates, for the first time in a mainstream American literary scene, Hispanic characters as complex and multidimensional who, despite their individual flaws, possess depth and credibility\\".

The ship was originally authorized under the Lend-Lease Act as BAPM-5, the fifth of seven British Mechanized Artillery Transports, to be named HMS Portway (F144). Reclassified a Landing Ship Dock, LSD-13, on 1 July 1942, the contract for LSD-13 was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia, on 10 September 1942. Renamed HMS Spear, LSD-13's keel was laid down, on 11 November 1943. While under construction, LSD-13, , and were reassigned back to the United States. The ship was renamed Casa Grande, and, as the first of her class in the U.S. Navy, gave her name to the class. Casa Grande was launched 11 April 1944, sponsored by Mrs. G. Delapalme; and commissioned 5 June 1944, Lieutenant Commander F. E. Strumm, USNR, in command. Service history = World War II = Sailing from Hampton Roads 19 July 1944, Casa Grande was delayed at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone for repairs en route to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 21 August. Here she offloaded landing craft brought from the east coast, and loaded men and equipment for the invasion of Yap. However, upon her arrival at Eniwetok on 25 September, she was ordered to Manus Island to prepare for the Leyte operation. Assigned to the Southern Attack Force, she entered Leyte Gulf uneventfully, and took part in the initial assault on 20 October. Her men worked at fever pace under enemy air attack as they launched their landing craft and serviced other small craft engaged in this triumphant return to the Philippines, and on 22 October, she withdrew for Hollandia. During the next month, she made two voyages from New Guinea to Leyte, ferrying reinforcements, and evacuating casualties. December 1944 found Casa Grande preparing for the second of the massive operations in the Philippines, and on 31 December she sailed in Attack Group \\"Baker\\" of Task Force 79 (TF 79) for Lingayen Gulf. First enemy contact came at sunset on 8 January 1945, as a small but determined group of kamikazes attacked. One of these broke through to damage the aircraft carrier severely, but Casa Grande came through unscathed, and joined in driving away the scattered individual enemy aircraft which pushed the attack onward. Although sporadic attacks by Japanese aircraft and small ships tried to disrupt the landings, the long months of detailed planning bore fruit as Casa Grande and the others of her group carried out their landing assignments smoothly on 9 January 1945. She continued to operate in support of the invasion, plying between Lingayen, Leyte, and Morotai until 30 January. Casa Grande next cruised among the Solomons to load Marines, landing craft, and tanks for the invasion of Okinawa. She took departure from Ulithi on 26 March, and arrived off Okinawa at dawn of 1 April. Landing equipment and troops under the first of the kamikaze attacks which were to bathe the Okinawa operation in blood, she moved to Kerama Retto on 4 April to operate a small boat repair shop there until 3 June, when she sailed for a minor overhaul at Leyte. Through July 1945, Casa Grande sailed between ports of the South Pacific and Philippines transporting men and landing craft, and on 23 July she sailed for dry-docking at San Francisco. Between 12 September 1945, when she returned to Honolulu, and 20 April 1946, when she docked at San Francisco, Casa Grande supported occupation and redeployment operations in the western Pacific. She ferried landing craft and motor torpedo boat squadrons, calling at ports in the South Pacific, China, Japan, Korea, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Alaska. On 14 May 1946, she left San Francisco for Norfolk, Va., where she was decommissioned and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Norfolk Group 23 October 1946. = 1950 ‚Äì 1969 = Casa Grande discharging LCU-1491 from her well deck, circa 1957. With the outbreak of the Korean War, Casa Grande was recommissioned 1 November 1950 and based at Norfolk. Exercises off the east coast, and supply missions to Newfoundland and Greenland, as well as amphibious training in the Caribbean, formed the pattern of her operations through 1960. She voyaged to the Mediterranean for service in the 6th Fleet on three occasions. She sailed for the first such deployment 20 April 1953, and on 13 August, was dispatched to the Ionian Islands to aid victims of earthquakes. At Cephalonia she established a beach center for medical supplies and provisions, and sent parties into the mountains to deliver supplies and bury the dead. When Casa Grande sailed from Cephalonia a week later, she left behind a hospital corpsman, as well as details of Marines who began rebuilding homes and roads. She returned to Norfolk from this cruise 28 October 1953. Her next deployment to the Mediterranean took place between 29 July 1959 and 9 February 1960. On her return to the States she cruised off the east coast in amphibious exercises and participated briefly in \\"Project Mercury\\" (man in space) operations. Casa Grande sailed for 6th Fleet duty in November and finished 1962 in the Mediterranean as the command ship of Task Force 61 Amphibious Squadron Six. Casa Grande was decommissioned on 6 October 1969, and transferred to the National Defense Reserve Force. The ship was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, on 11 October 1976, and sold, 6 April 1992, for $270,000 to Baxter Shipping Inc., Burbank, California.

It depicts a Scottish boy who longs to be a spaceman, is transported to a parallel communist Scotland where he takes part in a space mission to a black hole, and returns to the real world in middle age, possibly as a ghost. The novel is in three ‚ÄúBooks‚Äù, with the central one (set in the alternate world) being longest, predominantly serious in tone, while the outer sections are shorter and more humorous. The title refers to the Russian Sputnik program and the alternative name for Scotland, Caledonia, suggesting the idea of Scotland as a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Plot *Book One Robbie Coyle, nine years old at the start of the book, lives in Kenzie in Scotland‚Äôs Central Belt in the early 1970s. He dreams of going into space; but because of his father‚Äôs anti-American, pro-Soviet views, he wants to be a cosmonaut rather than an astronaut. He picks up an Eastern European radio station called Voice of the Red Star, imagines it to be a telepathic signal from another planet, and begs to be taken there. *Book Two Nineteen-year-old Robert Coyle lives in the British Democratic Republic ‚Äì a Communist state founded after the overthrow of Nazi occupation in the ‚ÄúGreat Patriotic War‚Äù ‚Äì and has arrived at the Installation, a secret military base in Scotland, to take part in a space mission. A strange new object has been detected in the solar system, believed to be a black hole, and the volunteers are to explore it telepathically. Robert has confused memories of the time before his arrival, and the reader is left guessing the connection between Books One and Two. Perhaps the Robbie of Book One has been transported to the other world as he wished; or perhaps the Robert in Book Two is a ‚Äúparallel‚Äù version of the younger Robbie in Book One. The Installation itself is like a ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù in the sense that people arrive from the outside, but nobody ever seems to leave - except perhaps in death. *Book Three In a present-day recognisable reality, Robbie‚Äôs parents from Book One are now pensioners. Their story alternates with that of ‚Äúthe kid‚Äù, a runaway 13-year-old obsessed with science fiction stories such as Doctor Who, and with the idea that ‚Äúin an infinite universe everything is possible‚Äù. He meets a middle aged man (‚Äúthe stranger‚Äù) who claims to be a spaceman on a mission. The stranger could be the parallel-world Robert grown older - or a terrorist engaged in identity theft. Resisting logical resolution, the novel reprises and reworks themes that have recurred throughout the course of the book, creating an aesthetic unity that is emotionally ambivalent: a juxtaposition of the comic tone of Book One with the dark pessimism of Book Two.

Location HD 93250 is marked above centre in this mosaic of the Carina Nebula region. HD 93250 is one of the brightest stars in the region of the Carina Nebula. It is only 7.5 arc-minutes from the famous Eta Carinae and HD 93250 is considered to be a member of the same loose open cluster Trumpler 16, although it appears closer to the more compact Trumpler 14. HD 93250 is in a region of the Carina Nebula with several bright stars, for example HD 93268 and HDE 303311, but relatively few faint stars. It has been proposed that these bright stars are the core of a separate cluster called Collinder 232, but the lack of any concentration of fainter stars in the area makes it more likely that Collinder 232 is not a real cluster and HD 93250 is just an outlying member of one of the more obvious clusters. Membership of Trumpler 16 constrains the distance and likely age of HD 93250. Spectrum Although HD 93250 is known to be a binary star, individual spectra of the two components have never been observed, although they are thought to be very similar. The spectral type of HD 93250 has variously been given as O5, O6/7, O4, and O3. It has sometimes been classified as a main sequence star and sometimes as a giant star. The Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey has used it as the standard star for the newly created O4 subgiant spectral type. Binary HD 93250 is the brightest x-ray source in the Carina Nebula. It has long been suspected that this is due to colliding winds in a close pair of hot luminous stars, but investigations have failed to show any significant radial velocity variations to support this. In 2010, AMBER interferometry resolved HD 93250 into two separate stars. No relative motion or radial velocity variations could be detected and so the orbit and properties of the two stars is still uncertain. The projected separation of the stars is 1.5 mas, approximately 3.5 astronomical units. The two stars show no measurable colour difference and are both likely to be hot O stars with masses within 10% of each other. Properties The physical properties of HD 93250 have only been calculated on the assumption that it is a single star. The temperature is around 50,000 K and its luminosity around Calculations of the mass have shown discrepancies between spectroscopic models and evolutionary models, which may be resolved by analysis of two separate stars in the system.

Background and legacy Scriven played a huge role in establishing puppetry as a serious artform in Australia. His Tintookies and Little Fella Bindi toured all over Australasia. The Tintookies, from an Aboriginal word meaning 'little people who come from the sandhills', was an elaborate marionette musical first staged by creator Peter Scriven at the Elizabethan Theatre in Sydney in 1956. After the success of this production, TintookieBillington, M, Performing Arts: A Guide To Practice And Appreciation, p.161 became the generic name for any of the puppets used by the Marionette Theatre of Australia, formed by Scriven under the auspices of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1965. The board was chaired by Sir Howard Beale, president of the Arts Council, and included Dr H.C. Coombs, Dorothy Helmrich and Scriven, who was also artistic director. Apart from commissioning and presenting original Australian puppet works, the Marionette Theatre of Australia was to establish a training school, encourage the development of other groups, and import overseas companies.Peter Scriven 3 The Marionette Theatre of Australia produced innovative large-scale puppet shows with an overtly Australian content for children for more than 20 years, including the landmark productions LittleFella Bindi (1958) and Norman Lindsay's The Magic Pudding (1960). Bindi, the Aboriginal boy lead in LittleFella Bindi was manipulated by Scriven. He was supported by a team of five young puppeteers supervised by Igor Hyczka, a stage manager, a sound technician and a tour manager, Tony Gould (later to head the Queensland Performing Arts Centre). Later productions included The Explorers (telling the story of Australian explorers, Burke and Wills) and The Water Babies. A film version of The Explorers was produced in 1968 by Scriven for Film World Pty. Ltd.Films Scriven was highly dedicated even as a boy to marionettes. According to his teacher, William Dalziel Nicol, Scriven was one of the first students examined in puppetry after a course conducted by the Education Department in 1943 in Victoria, Australia.Nicol, William Dalziel (Bill) (1907‚Äì1978) Biographical Entry ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Scriven was a remarkable entrepreneurTredinnick, D, Tintookie Man, the Last of His Tribe: A Story of Peter Scriven Puppetry, (Australasian Drama Studies ‚Äì 1 October 2007 and used his own funds to establish his marionette company. His legacy lives on the marionettes of the Marionette Theatre Company which a central part of the archives of the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney. Honours Scriven was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday honours list in 1970 for services to Theatre. Later years After a spell in Singapore and Malaysia, Scriven returned to Sydney in 1973 as puppetry consultant to the Australia Council for the Arts. In late 1974 Scriven put together a new version of The Tintookies. Utilising around 100 near life-size marionettes, this was the biggest puppet production ever undertaken in Australia. It premiered at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne on 8 January 1975 and toured Asia in early 1976. Scriven's next home was Sri Lanka. He commissioned local puppeteers to make the marionettes for The Tintookie Man, a small-scale show that he presented on an independent tour of Australian schools in 1976-7. When he left to live in the Philippines, the show was continued by Graeme Mathieson, an accomplished puppeteer with whom Scriven had worked at the MTA. In 1974 Richard Bradshaw succeeded Scriven as artistic director of the Marionette Theatre of Australia. Scriven's work with marionettes was discontinued in favour of rod puppetry. The Marionette Theatre of Australia became an autonomous body in 1979 and from 1983 had its own theatre in the Rocks. It closed in 1988 due to losing federal government funding. Many of Scriven's marionettes were lost in a warehouse fire. Scriven spent his last years living in increasingly reduced circumstances in Manila, finally subsisting on just $5 a day. He worked on a play and an autobiography, but neither has been published. In 1998, diagnosed with a brain tumour, Scriven returned to Australia. He had been here just three weeks when, on 13 October 1998, he was found dead in a boarding house in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. The man whose artistry had entertained countless thousands of Australian youngsters and had inspired a new generation of professional puppeteers had just $1.50 in his pocket. He was survived by many of his Tintookie marionettes, which now live in the archives of the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney, and his brother, philosopher and polymath Michael Scriven. Scriven's enthusiasm and expertise had legitimised Australian puppetry, transforming it from a children's party distraction into a major performing art form that attracts wide audiences and government funding.

When a large portion of dense materials was removed under the tectonic plate at this location, the remaining portion of the crust and lithosphere underwent a rapid uplift forming this mountain range. In geodynamics, delamination refers to the loss and sinking (foundering) of the portion of the lowermost lithosphere from the tectonic plate to which it was attached. Mechanism The outer portion of the Earth is divided into an upper, lithosphere layer and a lower, asthenosphere layer. The lithosphere layer is composed of two parts, an upper, the crustal lithosphere and lower, the mantle lithosphere. The crustal lithosphere is in unstable mechanical equilibrium because the underlying mantle lithosphere has a greater density than the asthenosphere below.Bird, P. (1979). Continental delamination and the Colorado Plateau. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth (1978‚Äì2012), 84(B13), 7561-7571. The difference in densities can be explained by thermal expansion/contraction, composition, and phase changes.Kay, R. W., & Mahlburg Kay, S. (1993). Delamination and delamination Negative buoyancy of the lower continental crust and mantle lithosphere drive delamination.Meissner, R., & Mooney, W. (1998). Weakness of the lower continental crust: a condition for delamination, uplift, and escape. Tectonophysics, 296(1), 47-60. Delamination occurs when the lower continental crust and mantle lithosphere break away from the upper continental crust. There are two conditions that need to be met in order for delamination to proceed: *The lower lithosphere must be denser than the asthenosphere *The intrusion of more buoyant asthenosphere making contact with the crust and replacing dense lower lithosphere must occur. The metamorphic transition from mafic granulite facies to the denser eclogite facies in the lower portion of the crust is the main mechanism responsible for creating negative buoyancy of the lower lithosphere. The lower crust undergoes a density inversion, causing it to break off of the upper crust and sink into the mantle.Rollinson, H. R. (2009). Early Earth systems: a geochemical approach. John Wiley & Sons. Density inversions are more likely to occur where there are high mantle temperatures. This limits this phenomenon to arc environments, volcanic rifted margins and continental areas undergoing extension. The asthenosphere rises until it comes into contact with the base of the lower crust, causing the lower crust and lithospheric mantle to start to peel away. Slumping, cracking, or plume erosion facilitates the intrusion of underlying asthenosphere. Potential energy that drives the delamination is released as the low density, hot asthenosphere rises and replaces the higher density, cold lithosphere. Separation of lowermost crust and lithospheric mantle is controlled by the effective viscosity of the upper continental crust. These processes often occur in environments of rifting, plume erosion, continental collision or where there is convective instability. Convective instabilities facilitate delamination. The convection can simply peel away the lower crust or, in a different scenario, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability is created. Due to the instability in a local area, the base of the lithosphere breaks up into descending blobs fed by an enlarging region of thinning lithosphere. The space left behind by departing lithosphere is filled by upwelling asthenosphere.Nielsen, S. B., Paulsen, G. E., Hansen, D. L., Gemmer, L., Clausen, O. R., Jacobsen, B. H., ... & Gallagher, K. (2002). Paleocene initiation of Cenozoic uplift in Norway. Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 196(1), 45-65. Other factors in delamination As delamination continues, more asthenosphere rises to replace the lower lithosphere as it sinks. This process causes three different changes to occur which can have an effect on the delamination process. *If the viscosity of the upwelling asthenosphere is greater than that of the mantle lithosphere, delamination will stop. *The upwelling asthenosphere forms two chilled, solid boundary layers on the top and bottom of the sill layer. This reduces the thickness of the portion of the lowermost crust which behaves viscously. *Subsidence of the lithosphere acts to increase the thickness of the portion of the lowermost crust which behaves viscously. If the freezing of the asthenosphere dominates (2) the system is stable, however if subsidence, and therefore separation of the lower lithosphere dominates (3) the system is unstable. Processes (2) and (3) compete with each other. Geologic effects Delamination of the lithosphere has two major geologic effects. First, because a large portion of dense material is removed, the remaining portion of the crust and lithosphere undergo rapid uplift to form mountain ranges. Second, flow of hot mantle material encounters the base of the thin lithosphere and often results in melting and a new phase of volcanism. Delamination may thus account for some volcanic regions that have been attributed to mantle plumes in the past.Foulger, G. R. (2011). Plates vs plumes: A geological controversy. John Wiley & Sons. Relation to tectonic processes Delamination is seen in convergence zones, especially where continental-continental collisions occur. For example, delamination is seen in the Tibetan Plateau, which has formed from the collision of India with Asia. Observations which support delamination include sudden mafic volcanism and acceleration of uplift, occurring 14 to 11 Ma. Areas of extension are also associated with delamination. Negative buoyancy of the lower lithosphere drives delamination in both environments of collision and extension. During the collapse of a mountain belt, the thick crustal roots beneath what used to be a mountain disappear. The processes behind this disappearance are not clear. Granitic plutons formed by strong heat pulses have been associated with the disappearance of thick crustal roots. Delamination is a likely source for the heat pulses. The tectonic development of collapsed mountain belts is heavily debated. Some argue that delamination causes a second uplift along with crustal thickening, heating and volcanism. Others argue that delamination causes collapse and thinning of the crust. Some researchers postulate that the Sierra Nevada (California), Basin and Range Province and Colorado Plateau in the western USA exemplify this. Geologic examples One example of the effects of lithosphere delamination is seen in the Sierra Nevada (US)¬≤, Basin and Range Province and Colorado Plateau in the western USA. During crustal extension in the Basin and Range Province 10 million years ago, the upwelling of asthenosphere thinned the lithosphere. Heating caused by the rise of the warmer asthenosphere created a crustal lower-viscosity zone and delamination occurred on the flanks of the Basin and Range. Uplift of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California and the Colorado Plateau has occurred on the flanks as a result of the loss of high density lower lithosphere. Eclogite xenoliths found within the crust in the region support the metamorphic phase change associated with the density inversion in the lower crust. It is possible that the Sierra Nevada (US) is the only place on Earth where dense material is currently being removed from the crust.

It is 48 pages long, illustrated in black and white by Gianluca Pagliarini, (although the indicia include a September 2008 publication date the October 2008 date is correct). and was published by Avatar Press in October 2008. Plot Aetheric Mechanics is set in an alternate history March 1907, where steampunk technology is advanced far beyond the technology of the modern real world, including two-way television communications, air- and spacecraft powered by reactionless drives, and large combat mecha. The British Empire (which in this setting, includes realms on other planets) is engaged in a war against Ruritania. The war is not going favourably for Britain; however, the British government is covering up just how badly the war is going, including the fact that Ruritania is preparing an invasion of Britain. Dr. Robert Watcham, a captain and doctor in the British army on the French front, returns to London at the start of the story after his tour of duty is over. His friend, roommate, and colleague, Sax Raker, is the greatest detective in London, and one of the finest minds in Britain, with Watcham having written a number of exploits about him for the popular press. At the time of Watcham's return, Raker has been commissioned by Inspector Jarratt of Scotland Yard to investigate another case. A number of observers witnessed a spectral figure, flickering in and out of existence, murdering an engineer specialising in aetheric mechanics outside of the Royal Society, with several others having gone missing. Investigating outside the Society, Raker notices traces of mud beneath the victim, then is drawn to a figure standing in the crowd. Raker reveals it to be none other than his persistent rival, Inanna Meyer, whom Watcham (in a period of narration) notes that Raker is obsessed with but is unable to face that fact. Originally surmising that Inanna was hired by the Ruritanian government to destabilise Britain's vital science and engineering community, she reveals that she is now working for the British government: Raker's brother, Dunmow, recruited her into the British Secret Service, and she was also investigating the murder. With that piece of information, Raker is able to solve the case, deducing that the mud near the victim came from the River Fleet. He therefore surmises that a villain has been kidnapping scientists to create some type of weapon directly beneath London, and the murder was done to silence a failed kidnapping. Raker, Watcham, and Inanna head into the River Fleet's underground channel as the Ruritanian aeroplanes begin a heavy fire-bombing of London in preparation for their final assault on Britain. Beneath London, they indeed find a large colony of kidnapped scientists, now escaping from the Ruritanian bombing. The \\"man who wasn't there\\" is also found, and identifies himself as Jonathan Vogel. Vogel explains that he is actually from the future, and that the reason he is fading in and out if existence is due to an accident he experienced. Vogel was a scientist working on an addition to the Large Hadron Collider which would have enabled ansible-like communication with a space probe being sent to Pluto using a quantum string. However, the \\"other\\" end of the string became loose, fixing onto 1905 ‚Äì the year the special relativity was proposed by Albert Einstein, thus eliminating the theory of aether that had been held before. Vogel was sent back through time, along with his personal handheld computer ‚Äì containing, among other things, the stories of Sherlock Holmes and Sexton Blake, The Prisoner of Zenda, and a number of old movies and Japanese anime. Vogel explains that, to 'bridge' between the two realities, the stories contained in his handheld were merged with the real-world 1905, creating the world of Aetheric Mechanics ‚Äì and that neither Sax, nor Watcham, nor Inanna, nor Ruritania were real. Vogel states that the flickering is him being stranded between two worlds, and he has constructed a computer which, within a few hours, will finish its calculation to repair the damage caused to time, allowing Vogel to return home by destroying the fictional world he created. Seeing that as a chance to prevent Britain's destruction by Ruritania, Inanna and Watcham agree to let Vogel continue. They do not notice that Raker is horrified and outraged at the thought of not existing. Raker removes his pistol and shoots Vogel in the chest, killing him. He explains that he has finally realised the one thing he can't do: bear to think of a world where Inanna doesn't exist. Leaving Inanna and Watcham dumbstruck behind him, Raker races back through the tunnels below London, promising that using his intellect, he will still manage to find a way to prevent Britain from losing the war.

Palmyra has a rich Civil War history with Major General Joseph Wheeler of the Confederate army took position on the Cumberland River in late January 1863. His plan was to disrupt Union ships going to Fort Donelson at Dover, a few miles west of Palmyra. Aware of Wheeler's intentions, the Union did not send any ships up or down the river, forcing Wheeler to attack Fort Donelson with his cavalry division. Wheeler was unable to take Fort Donelson and had to retreat after sustaining heavy losses. Palmyra was one vote away from being the state capital of Tennessee.

Raceway systems are among the earliest methods used for inland aquaculture. A raceway usually consists of rectangular basins or canals constructed of concrete and equipped with an inlet and outlet. A continuous water flow-through is maintained to provide the required level of water quality, which allows animals to be cultured at higher densities within the raceway.\\"Raceways\\".

Water sources for raceway aquaculture operations are usually streams, springs, reservoirs or deep wells. Trout do best in spring water because it keeps a constant temperature, while catfish need a strong flow, about 80 litres per second for every 0.4 hectares of raceway. A backup water supply should be positioned so, if the water supply or pump fails, it can flow by gravity into the start of the raceway.  Construction  Most raceways are made of reinforced concrete, though some earthen raceways are also built. Earthen raceways with plastic liners cost little and are easy to build, but cleaning and disinfecting them is difficult and plastic linings are fragile. Reinforced concrete is more expensive, but is durable and can be shaped in complex ways. Raceway tanks can also be built from polyester resin. These tanks have smooth walls, and are mobile and easy to service. However, their cost limits them to small sizes, under 5 cubic metres.  Size  A raceway is most often a rectangular canal with a water current flowing from a supply end to an exit end. The length to width ratio is important in raceways. To prevent the fish stock from swimming in circular movements, which would cause debris to build up in the centre, a length to width ratio of at least six to one is recommended. If the width is too large this could result in a feeble current speed which is not desirable (see below). The length of a raceway unit is usually constrained by the water quality or by how much stock a unit can hold for ease of management. The average depth of a raceway for fin fish, such as rainbow trout, is about one metre.Seltz, J. (n/a). \\"Rearing Structures for Aquaculture\\". Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Fisheries and Aquaculture Department. Accessed 29.9.2011. This means each section in a raceway should be about 30 m long and 2.5‚Äì3 m wide. The landscape should sloped to one or two percent, so the flow through the system can be maintained by gravity. The raceway should not be curved, so the flow will be uniform.Pillay, T.V.R. & Kutty, N. (2005). \\"Aquaculture: Principles and Practices.‚Äù Wiley-Blackwell, pp 82‚Äì83. A raceway farm for freshwater fin fish usually has a dozen or more parallel raceway strips build alongside each other, with each strip consisting of 15 to 20 or more serial sections. The risk of unhygienic conditions increases towards the lower level sections, and can be kept in check by ensuring there are not too many sections and the water flow is adequate. In order to isolate any diseased section and avoid transmitting the disease back to the upper raceways, each section should have its own drainage channel. Controls, such as weirs, are also needed to ensure individual raceways can't accidentally overflow or empty.  Water flow  The water flow rate in a raceway system needs to be sufficiently high to meet the respiratory (dissolved oxygen) requirements for the species concerned and to flush out metabolic wastes, especially ammonia.Stickney, R.R. (1994). Principles of Aquaculture. John Wiley & Sons, pp 107‚Äì111. In a well designed system, the existing water in the raceway is largely replaced by new water when the same volume of new water enters the raceway. Self-cleaning can sometimes be achieved if the fish stocks density is sufficiently high and the water level is sufficiently low. For example, if trout are stocked at 20 kilograms per cubic metre, they can keep the raceway unit clean by their swimming movements, preventing waste solids from settling to the raceway floor. However, in most cases it is necessary to frequently clean raceways. The simplest way is to lower the water level in the raceway units, which increases the speed of the water current, and then herd the fish together till they flush the waste from the raceway. Solid wastes which accumulate at the raceway bottom can be removed by pumps.\\"Raceway Culture for Freshwater Species\\". Korea ‚Äì U.S. Aquaculture. Accessed 29.9.2011. Oxygen levels in the water can be kept high if the raceway units are placed one after the other with intermediate drops over weirs, or by the use of aeration systems such as pumps, blowers and agitators. Generally the water should be replaced about every hour. This means a typical raceway section requires a flow rate around 30 liters per second. However, the optimum flow through rate depends on the species, because there are differences in the rates at which oxygen is consumed and metabolic wastes are produced. For example, trout and juvenile salmon are less tolerant of degraded water quality and require a more rapid water turnover than catfish or tilapia. The flow rate necessary to maintain water quality can also change through the year, as the temperature changes and the cultured species grow larger. For reason such as these, continuous monitoring of water quality is important, including measurements of water flow rates, pH levels and temperature, as well as the levels of dissolved oxygen, and suspended and solid waste material.  Maximum load  The maximum load of organisms that can be cultured in a raceway system depends on the species, and particularly on the size of the species. For trout, stocking rates of 30 to 50 kg/m3 are normal at the end of a rearing cycle, while for marine species, such as sea bass and sea bream, the achievable load is lower, between 15 and 20 kg/m3. The total volume required for a raceway is calculated by dividing the total amount of fish in kg by the desired stocking rate in kg per m3. Feed In most raceway aquaculture food needs to be supplied. The composition of the food, and the amount and time of feeding needs to be adjusted to the specific species.Project Information, Grant 6, Aquaculture Product and Marketing Development Project, West Virginia University. Accessed 29.9.2011. This can be optimised to reduce costs and minimize the amount of waste.  Waste water  The treatment of waste water issuing from raceway farms is a major concern. Fish fecal matter and uneaten feed are typically the major elements of solid waste produced in raceway aquaculture farms. These can adversely impact the environment in the receiving water body.ucker, C.S. & Hargreaves, J.A. (2008). ‚ÄúEnvironmental best management practices for aquaculture.‚Äù John Wiley & Sons, p. 351. Of particular environmental concern is the waste product phosphorus. Excessive discharge of phosphorus to receiving waters can result in eutrophication. For example, in Korea poor waste treatments in trout farms resulted in reservoirs and rivers developing red tides, which caused wider social problems. Because raceway aquaculture operations discharge large volumes of water, the concentration of discharged solids is low. This means it is not easy to treat and implement practical, cost effective treatments. Technologies for the removal of solids include microscreens, dual-drain tanks, swirl separators, plate separators, baffles, media filters, air flotation, foam fractionation, chemical flocculation, and constructed wetlands. But because of the impracticality and / or high costs of these methods, most of them are not applicable for commercial aquaculture. As a consequence, sedimentation (settling) is still the most widely applied and cost effective technology. Since 1999, regulations in South Korea require that all raceway farms provide waste water treatment facilities covering at least 20% of the farmed area to prevent pollution of the freshwater environment. Open race way ponds were used for removal of heavy metal ions like lead using live Spirulina (Arthospira) sp.Siva Kiran RR, Madhu GM*, Satyanarayana SV, Kalpana P, Bindiya P, Subba Rangaiah G. \\"Equilibrium and kinetic studies of lead biosorption by three Spirulina (Arthrospira) species in open raceway ponds.\\" Journal of Biochemical Technology Vol. 6, no. 1 (2015): 894-909.  In shrimp farming  Recently Dr. Addison Lawrence received a patent for his System and Method for Super-Intensive Shrimp Production. This system employs artificial raceways to produce large quantities of shrimp. In an interview with Undercurrent News Lawrence said, ‚ÄúWe have several very interested commercial groups interested in using the technology to develop shrimp farms in the United States, and we have several groups interested in developing farms outside of the US,\\" Super- Intensive Shrimp Production offers the capability to have no outflow, saving on water costs, reducing the impact on local water resources and reducing the environmental impact of shrimp farming.

Researchers use Y-DNA, mtDNA, and other autosomal DNAs to identify haplogroups and haplotypes in ancient populations of Egypt, Persia, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Arabia, the Levant, and other areas. History Developments in DNA sequencing in the 1970s and 1980s provided researchers with the tools needed to study human genetic variation and the genetics of human populations to discover founder populations of modern people groups and human migrations. In 2005, National Geographic launched The Genographic Project, led by 12 prominent scientists and researchers, to study and map historical human migration patterns by collecting and analyzing DNA samples from hundreds of thousands of people from around the world. Egypt Contamination from handling and intrusion from microbes create obstacles to the recovery of Ancient DNA. Consequently, most DNA studies have been carried out on modern Egyptian populations with the intent of learning about the influences of historical migrations on the population of Egypt. In general, various DNA studies have found that the gene frequencies of North African populations are intermediate between those of the Near East, the Horn of Africa, southern Europe and Sub Saharan Africa,Cavalli-Sforza, History and Geography of Human Genes, The intermediacy of North Africa and to a lesser extent Europe is apparent though Egypt's NRY frequency distributions appear to be much more similar to those of the Middle East than to any sub-Saharan African population, suggesting a much larger Eurasian genetic component.Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., P. Menozzi, and A. Piazza. 1994. The History and Geography of Human Genes. Princeton: Princeton University Press.The present population of the Sahara is Sudan in the extreme north, with an increase of Negroid component as one goes south Blood typing and DNA sampling on ancient Egyptian mummies is scant; however, a 1982 study of blood typing of dynastic mummies found ABO frequencies to be most similar to modern Egyptians and some also to Northern Haratin populations. ABO blood group distribution shows that the Egyptians form a sister group to North African populations, including Berbers, Nubians and Canary Islanders. In 2013, Nature announced the publication of the first genetic study utilizing next-generation sequencing to ascertain the ancestral lineage of an Ancient Egyptian individual. The research was led by Carsten Pusch of the University of T√ºbingen in Germany and Rabab Khairat, who released their findings in the Journal of Applied Genetics. DNA was extracted from the heads of five Egyptian mummies that were housed at the institution. All the specimens were dated between 806 BC and 124 AD, a timeframe corresponding with the late Dynastic period. The researchers observed that one of the mummified individuals likely belonged to the mtDNA haplogroup I2, a maternal clade that is believed to have originated in Western Asia.  Iran (Persia)  A recent study analyzed the autosomal DNA and genome of an Iron Age Iranian sample taken from Teppe Hasanlu (F38_Hasanlu, dated to 971-832 BCE) and revealed it has close affinities to modern Iranians. The sample's data exists on GEDMatch under the kit number M381564. This indicates strong genetic continuity between modern Iranians and their Iron Age ancestors, discrediting Nordicist claims, such as those made by Arthur de Gobineau, that the ancient Achaemenids were genetically Western European. The latest comparative study (2013) on the complete mitochondrial DNA diversity in Iranians has indicated that Iranian Azeris are more related to the people of Georgia, than they are to other Iranians (Persians, Armenians, etc.), while the Persians, Armenians and Qashqai on the other hand were more related to each other. It furthermore showed that overall, the complete mtDNA sequence analysis revealed an extremely high level of genetic diversity in the Iranian populations studied which is comparable to the other groups from the South Caucasus, Anatolia and Europe. The same 2013 research further noted that \\"the results of AMOVA and MDS analyses did not associate any regional and/or linguistic group of populations in the Anatolia, Caucasus and Iran region pointing to strong genetic affinity of Indo-European speaking Persians and Turkic-speaking Qashqais, thus suggesting their origin from a common maternal ancestral gene pool. The pronounced influence of the South Caucasus populations on the maternal diversity of Iranian Azeris is also evident from the MDS analysis results.\\" The study also notes that \\" It is worth pointing out the position of Azeris from the Caucasus region, who despite their supposed common origin with Iranian Azeris, cluster quite separately and occupy an intermediate position between the Azeris/Georgians and Turks/Iranians grouping\\". The MtDNA results from the samples overall on average closely resemble those found in the neighbouring regions of the Caucasus, Anatolia, and to a lesser extent (Northern) Mesopotamia. Among the most common MtDNA lineages in the nation, namely U3b3, appears to be restricted to populations of Iran and the Caucasus, while the sub-cluster U3b1a is common in the whole Near East region. An earlier genetic research was made by Nasidze et al. (2006) on the North Iranian populations on the Gilaks and Mazandaranis, spanning the southwestern coast of the Caspian Sea, up to the border with neighbouring Azerbaijan. The Gilaks and Mazandaranis comprise 7% of the Iranian population. It has been suggested that their ancestors came from the Caucasus region, perhaps displacing an earlier group in the South Caspian. Linguistic evidence supports this scenario, in that the Gilaki and Mazandarani languages (but not other Iranian languages) share certain typological features with Caucasian languages, and specifically South Caucasian languages. There have been patterns analyzed of mtDNA and Y chromosome variation in the Gilaki and Mazandarani. Based on mtDNA HV1 sequences tested by Nasidze et al., the Gilaks and Mazandarani most closely resemble their geographic and linguistic neighbors, namely other Iranian groups. However, their Y chromosome types most closely resemble those found in groups from the South Caucasus. A scenario that explains these differences is a south Caucasian origin for the ancestors of the Gilani and Mazandarani, followed by introgression of women (but not men) from local Iranian groups, possibly because of patrilocality. Given that both mtDNA and language are maternally transmitted, the incorporation of local Iranian women would have resulted in the concomitant replacement of the ancestral Caucasian language and mtDNA types of the Gilani and Mazandarani with their current Iranian language and mtDNA types. Concomitant replacement of language and mtDNA may be a more general phenomenon than previously recognized. The Mazandarani and Gilani groups fall inside a major cluster consisting of populations from the Caucasus and West Asia and are particularly close to the South Caucasus groups‚ÄîGeorgians, Armenians, and Azerbaijanis. Iranians from Tehran and Isfahan are situated more distantly from these groups. Iraq (Mesopotamia) In the 1995 book The History and Geography of Human Genes the authors wrote that: \\"The Assyrians are a fairly homogeneous group of people, believed to originate from the land of old Assyria in northern Iraq [..] they are Christians and are bona fide descendants of their ancient namesakes.\\"Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Paolo Menozzi, Alberto Piazza, The History and Geography of Human Genes, p. 243 In a 2006 study of the Y chromosome DNA of six regional populations, including, for comparison, Assyrians and Syrians, researchers found that, \\"the two Semitic populations (Assyrians and Syrians) are very distinct from each other according to both [comparative] axes. This difference supported also by other methods of comparison points out the weak genetic affinity between the two populations with different historical destinies.\\" Yepiskoposian et al., Iran and the Caucasus, Volume 10, Number 2, 2006, pp. 191‚Äì208(18), \\"Genetic Testing of Language Replacement Hypothesis in Southwest Asia\\" A 2008 study on the genetics of \\"old ethnic groups in Mesopotamia,\\" including 340 subjects from seven ethnic communities (\\"These populations included Assyrians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Armenians, Arabs and Turkmen (representing ethnic groups from Iran, restricted by rules of their religion), and the Iraqi and Kuwaiti populations from Iraq and Kuwait.\\") found that Assyrians were homogeneous with respect to all other ethnic groups sampled in the study, regardless of religious affiliation. \\"The relationship probability was lowest between Assyrians and other communities. Endogamy was found to be high for this population through determination of the heterogeneity coefficient (+0,6867), Our study supports earlier findings indicating the relatively closed nature of the Assyrian community as a whole, which as a result of their religious and cultural traditions, have had little intermixture with other populations.\\" A study published in 2011 looking at the relationship between Iraq's Marsh Arabs and ancient Sumerians concluded \\"the modern Marsh Arabs of Iraq harbour mtDNAs and Y chromosomes that are predominantly of Middle Eastern origin. Therefore, certain cultural features of the area such as water buffalo breeding and rice farming, which were most likely introduced from the Indian sub-continent, only marginally affected the gene pool of the autochthonous people of the region. Moreover, a Middle Eastern ancestral origin of the modern population of the marshes of southern Iraq implies that, if the Marsh Arabs are descendants of the ancient Sumerians, also Sumerians were not of Indian or Southern Asian ancestry.\\" The same 2011 study, when focusing on the genetics of the Ma ªdƒÅn people of Iraq, identified Y chromosome haplotypes shared by Marsh Arabs, Arabic speaking Iraqis, Assyrians and Mandeans \\"supporting a common local background.\\" A 2013 study based on DNA extracted from the dental remains of four individuals, unearthed at Tell Ashara (ancient Terqa, in modern Syria) and Tell Masaikh (ancient Kar-Assurnasirpal) suggested a possible genetic link between the people of Bronze Age Mesopotamia and Northern India. According to the study, \\"We anticipate that the analysed remains from [northern] Mesopotamia belonged to people with genetic affinity to the Indian subcontinent since the distribution of identified ancient haplotypes indicates solid link with populations from the region of South Asia-Tibet (Trans-Himalaya). They may have been descendants of migrants from much earlier times, spreading the clades of the macrohaplogroup M throughout Eurasia and founding regional Mesopotamian groups like that of Terqa or just merchants moving along trade routes passing near or through the region.\\" A 2014 study expanding on the 2013 study and based on analysis of 15751 DNA samples arrives at the conclusion that the sources for the minority South Asian DNA in some Mesopotamian populations are in fact historically much later Tamil merchants involved in trade with the Roman empire, stating \\"M65a, M49 and/or M61 haplogroups carrying ancient Mesopotamians might have been the merchants from India\\". A 2017 study found that Assyrians and Yazidis appear to have a closer link to the original populations of Ancient Mesopotamia than Arabs, Kurds and Turcomans.\\"Consequently, despite corresponding to isolated and homogenous populations, contemporary Assyrians and Yazidis from Northern Iraq may in fact have a stronger continuity with the original genetic stock of the Mesopotamian people, which possibly provided the basis for the ethnogenesis of various subsequent Near Eastern populations. the Northern Iraqi Assyrian and Yazidi populations from the current study were found to position in the middle of a genetic continuum between the Near East and Southeastern Europe.\\" http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187408 Levant (Israel, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan) Zalloua and Wells (2004), under the auspices of a grant from National Geographic Magazine, examined the origins of the Canaanite Phoenicians. The debate between Wells and Zalloua was whether haplogroup J2 (M172) should be identified as that of the Phoenicians or that of its \\"parent\\" haplogroup M89 on the YDNA phylogenetic tree. Initial consensus suggested that J2 be identified with the Canaanite-Phoenician (Northwest Semitic) population, with avenues open for future research.National Geographic Magazine, October 2004. Available online: http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/features/world/asia/lebanon/phoenicians- text/1; and http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=57215 [accessed: March 10, 2008] As Wells commented, \\"The Phoenicians were the Canaanites\\" It was reported in the PBS description of the National Geographic TV Special on this study entitled \\"Quest for the Phoenicians\\" that ancient DNA was included in this study as extracted from the tooth of a 2500-year-old Phoenician mummy. Wells identified the haplogroup of the Canaanites as haplogroup J2 which originated in northern Mesopotamia.and http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=57215 [Accessed April 11, 2008 The National Geographic Genographic Project linked haplogroup J2 to the site of Jericho, Tel el-Sultan, ca. 8500 BCE and indicated that in modern populations, haplogroup J2 is found primarily in the Middle East, but also along the coasts of North Africa and Southern Europe, with especially high distribution among present-day Jewish populations (30%), Southern Italians (20%), and lower frequencies in Southern Spain (10%).The Atlas of the Human Journey-Genetic Markers-Haplogroup J2 (M172): [Accessed April 11, 2008] In a 2005 study of ASPM gene variants, Mekel-Bobrov et al. found that the Israeli Druze people of the Carmel region have among the highest rate of the newly evolved ASPM haplogroup D, at 52.2% occurrence of the approximately 6,000-year-old allele. While it is not yet known exactly what selective advantage is provided by this gene variant, the haplogroup D allele is thought to be positively selected in populations and to confer some substantial advantage that has caused its frequency to rapidly increase. According to DNA testing, Druze are remarkable for the high frequency (35%) of males who carry the Y-chromosomal haplogroup L, which is otherwise uncommon in the Mideast (Shen et al. 2004). This haplogroup originates from prehistoric South Asia and has spread from Pakistan into southern Iran. Cruciani in 2007 found E1b1b1a2 (E-V13) [one from Sub Clades of E1b1b1a1 (E-M78)] in high levels (>10% of the male population) in Turkish Cypriot and Druze Arab lineages. Recent genetic clustering analyses of ethnic groups are consistent with the close ancestral relationship between the Druze and Cypriots, and also identified similarity to the general Syrian and Lebanese populations, as well as a variety of Jewish lineages (Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Iraqi Jewish, and Moroccan Jews) (Behar et al. 2010). A study published by the National Academy of Sciences found that \\"the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population\\", and suggested that \\"most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighbouring non-Jewish communities during and after the Diaspora\\". Researchers expressed surprise at the remarkable genetic uniformity they found among modern Jews, no matter where the diaspora has become dispersed around the world. Skorecki and colleague wrote that \\"the extremely close affinity of Jewish and non-Jewish Middle Eastern populations observed ... supports the hypothesis of a common Middle Eastern origin\\". This research has suggested that, in addition to Israelite male, significant female founder ancestry might also derive from the Middle East-with 40% of Ashkenazim descended from four women who lived about 2000‚Äì3000 years ago in the Middle East. In addition, Behar (2006) suggested that the rest of Ashkenazi mtDNA is originated from about 150 women; most of those were probably of Middle Eastern origin. A 2013 genetic study suggested that the four founding maternal lineages of Ashkenazi Jews originate in Europe and that only ~8% of Ashkenazi mtDNA can confidently be assigned a Near Eastern origin, while >80% of Ashkenazi maternal lineages have a likely European origin, while a 2014 study carried out by Spanish geneticists suggested an ancient Near Eastern origin of the four founding maternal lineages of Ashkenazi Jews. In 2004, a team of geneticists from Stanford University, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tartu University (Estonia), Barzilai Medical Center (Ashkelon, Israel), and the Assaf Harofeh Medical Center (Zerifin, Israel), studied the modern Samaritan ethnic community living in Israel in comparison with modern Israeli populations to explore the ancient genetic history of these people groups. The Samaritans or Shomronim (singular: Shomroni; Hebrew: ◊©◊ï◊û◊®◊ï◊†◊ô) trace their origins to the Assyrian province of Shomron (Samaria) in ancient Israel in the period after the Assyrian conquest circa 722 BCE. Shomron was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel when it was conquered by the Assyrians and gave the name to the ancient province of Samaria and the Samaritan people group. Tradition holds that the Samaritans were a mixed group of Israelites who were not exiled or were sent back or returned from exile and non-Israelites relocated to the region by the Assyrians. The modern-day Samaritans are believed to be the direct descendants of the ancient Samaritans. Their findings reported on four family lineages among the Samaritans: the Tsdaka family (tradition: tribe of Menasseh), the Joshua-Marhiv and Danfi families (tradition: tribe of Ephraim), and the Cohen family (tradition: tribe of Levi). All Samaritan families were found in haplogroups J1 and J2, except the Cohen family which was found in haplogroup E3b1a-M78. This article predated the E3b1a subclades based on the research of Cruciani, et al. A 2018 study conducted by scholars from Tel-Aviv University, the Israel Antiquities Authority and Harvard University had discovered that 22 out of the 600 people who were buried in Peki'in cave from the Chalcolithic Period were of both local Levantine and Persian and ZagrosDNA STUDY IN ISRAELI CAVE SHEDS LIGHT ON ORIGINS OF CHALCOLITHIC CULTURE area ancestries, or as phrased in the paper itself: \\"Ancient DNA from Chalcolithic Israel reveals the role of population mixture in cultural transformation,‚Äù the scientists concluded that the homogeneous community found in the cave could source ~57% of its ancestry from groups related to those of the local Levant Neolithic, ~26% from groups related to those of the Anatolian Neolithic, and ~17% from groups related to those of the Iran Chalcolithic.\\".Anomalous blue- eyed people came to Israel 6,500 years ago from Iran, DNA shows The scholars noted that the Zagros genetic material held ‚ÄúCertain characteristics, such as genetic mutations contributing to blue eye color, were not seen in the DNA test results of earlier Levantine human remains...The blue-eyed, fair-skinned community didn‚Äôt continue, but at least now researchers have an idea why. ‚ÄúThese findings suggest that the rise and fall of the Chalcolithic culture are probably due to demographic changes in the region‚Äù. A 2020 genetic study on Bronze Age southern Levantine (Canaanite) remains found evidence of large scale migration of populations related to those of the Zagros or Bronze Age Caucasus into the southern Levant by the Bronze Age (resulting in a Bronze Age Canaanite population descended from both those migrants and from earlier Neolithic Levantine peoples), and suggested a substantial genetic continuity from the Levantine Bronze Age both in modern-day Arabic-speaking Levantine populations (such as Syrians, Druze, Lebanese, and Palestinians) and Jewish groups (such as Moroccan, Ashkenazi, and Mizrahi Jews), who are all suggested to derive a majority (about half or more) of their ancestry from Bronze Age and post-Bronze-Age Levantine populations (with Ashkenazi Jews deriving just over half of their ancestry from Bronze-Age Levantines and the rest from Europeans, and Arabic-speaking Levantines, Moroccan Jews, and Mizrahi Jews deriving a larger majority of their ancestry from Bronze Age Levantines). From a study published in Cell on May 28th 2020: \\"Understanding the nature of this movement was the primary motivation behind this study. Here, we present a large-scale analysis of genome-wide data from key sites of prehistoric Anatolia, the Northern Levant, and the Southern Caucasian lowlands ... In the Northern Levant, we identified a major genetic shift between the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age periods. During this transition, Northern Levantine populations experienced gene flow from new groups harboring ancestries related to both Zagros/Caucasus and the Southern Levant. This suggests a shift in social orientation, perhaps in response to the rise of urban centers in Mesopotamia, which to date remain genetically unsampled.\\" They further add: \\"This expansion is recorded in the region of the Northern Levant ca. 2800 BCE and could be associated with the movement/ migration of people from Eastern Anatolia and the Southern Caucasian highlands. However, our results do not support this scenario for a number of reasons\\". \\"There are extensive textual references from the end of the EBA through the LBA referring to groups of people arriving into the area of the Amuq Valley. Although these groups were named, likely based on designations (e.g., Amorites, Hurrians), the formative context of their (cultural) identity and their geographic origins remain debated. One recent hypothesis (Weiss, 2014, 2017; Akar and Kara, 2020) associates the arrival of these groups with climate-forced population movement during the ‚Äò‚Äò4.2k BP event,‚Äô‚Äô a Mega Drought that led to the abandonment of the entire Khabur river valley in Northern Mesopotamia and the search of nearby habitable areas.\\" = Lebanon = A 2013 genetic study carried out by Haber at al found significant genetic differences between the Muslim and Christian population of Levant. According to the authors \\"The population tree splits Levantine populations in two branches: one leading to Europeans and Central Asians that includes Lebanese, Armenians, Cypriots, Druze and Jews, as well as Turks, Iranians and Caucasian populations; and a second branch composed of Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians, as well as North Africans, Ethiopians, Saudis, and Bedouins. The tree shows a correlation between religion and the population structures in the Levant: all Jews (Sephardi and Ashkenazi) cluster in one branch; Druze from Mount Lebanon and Druze from Mount Carmel are depicted on a private branch; and Lebanese Christians form a private branch with the Christian populations of Armenia and Cyprus placing the Lebanese Muslims as an outer group. The predominantly Muslim populations of Syrians, Palestinians and Jordanians cluster on branches with other Muslim populations as distant as Morocco and Yemen.\\" The authors explained that \\"In particular, conversion of the region's populations to Islam appears to have introduced major rearrangements in populations' relations through admixture with culturally similar but geographically remote populations, leading to genetic similarities between remarkably distant populations like Jordanians, Moroccans, and Yemenis. Conversely, other populations, like Christians and Druze, became genetically isolated in the new cultural environment.\\" In conclusions, the authors reconstructed the genetic structure of ancient Levantines and found that a pre-Islamic expansion Levant was more genetically similar to Europeans than to current Middle Easterners. A 2017 genetic study carried out by Haber et al. found that Lebanon has maintained near-total genetic continuity since the Bronze Age with the ancient people of the Levant, which the researchers considered a surprising result considering the multiple waves of conquest. The authors of the test tested a model of the present-day Lebanese as a mixture of Sidon_BA and any other ancient Eurasian population using qpAdm, and found that the Lebanese can be best modeled as Sidon_BA 93% ¬± 1.6% and a Steppe Bronze Age population 7% ¬± 1.6%. In regards to phenotype, modern Lebanese were also found to be very close to ancient Levantine populations, with \\"SNPs associated with phenotypic traits showing that Sidon_BA and the Lebanese had comparable skin, hair, and eye colors (in general: light intermediate skin pigmentation, brown eyes, and dark hair) with similar frequencies of the underlying causal variants in SLC24A5 and HERC2, but with Sidon_BA probably having darker skin than Lebanese today from variants in SLC45A2 resulting in darker pigmentation.\\" Turkey (Anatolia) In population genetics the question has been debated whether the modern Turkish population is significantly related to other, mainly Central Asian, Turkic peoples (from whom the modern Turkish language originates), or whether they are rather derived from the indigenous largely Indo-European and Semitic speaking pre-Turkic populations of Anatolia (Asia Minor) which were, with the exception of Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians, Jews, Georgians, Circassians and Kurds, culturally assimilated during the late Middle Ages. The contribution of the Central Asian genetics to the modern Turkish people has been debated and become the subject of several studies. As a result, several studies have concluded that the historical (pre-Islamic and pre-Turkic) and indigenous Anatolian groups are in fact the primary source of the present-day Turkish population, in addition to neighboring peoples, such as Balkan peoples (such as Phrygians and Macedonian Greeks), and Central Asian Turkic people, from the Turkic homelands in modern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kirghizstan. The Pre-Islamic and Pre-Turkic speaking population of Anatolia consisted of, at different periods, a vast patchwork of Caucasoid peoples anatomically, linguistically and genetically distinct from Turkic peoples, including; Language Isolate speakers such as Hurrians, Hattians, Kaskians and Urartians among others, who were eventually absorbed by Indo-European populations, the most prominent being Greeks, Persians, Luwians, Hittites, Mitanni, Phrygians, Lydians, Cimmerians, Scythians, Medes, Lycians, Cilicians, Armenians, Celts and Corduene (Kurds). Semitic speaking peoples such as Akkadians, Assyrians, Amorites, Eblaites, Phoenicians, Ugarites, Arameans and Jews also maintained a longstanding presence across southern and south eastern Anatolia, and to a lesser degree, Kartvelian (Georgian) and Northwest Caucasian speaking peoples such as Circassians in the north east.

The confluence of the large Gibe River at with the smaller Wabe River forms the even larger Omo River. Consequently, the whole drainage basin is sometimes called Omo-Gibe River Basin with the Gibe and the Omo draining the upper and lower reaches, respectively. Located in southwest Ethiopia, the Gibe River is not navigable, like almost all rivers in the country. Overview The Gibe rises at an elevation of more than 2,000 m north of Bila town and west of the Chomen swamp (specifically, from Gudeya Bila woreda, which is located in the East Welega Zone, Oromia Region). The river is then flowing generally to the southeast to its confluence with the Wabe River. Its tributaries include the Amara, Alanga and Gilgel Gibe rivers. The southern drainage area of the Gibe includes the historic Gibe region, where a number of the former kingdoms of the Oromo and Sidama peoples were located. The Gibe River terminates at the confluence with the Wabe River at an elevation of 1060 m from where the resulting river downstream is called the Omo River.

'Should I ... use a match or lighter?', The Guardian, 11 July 2006 History of the brand The Swan brand began in 1883 when the Collard & Kendall match company in Bootle on Merseyside near Liverpool introduced 'Swan wax matches'. These were superseded by later versions including 'Swan White Pine Vestas' from the Diamond Match Company. These were formed of a wooden splint soaked in wax. They were finally christened 'Swan Vestas' in 1906 when Diamond merged with Bryant and May and the company enthusiastically promoted the Swan brand. By the 1930s 'Swan Vestas' had become 'Britain's best selling match'. The brand is now owned by the Swedish Match company. In popular culture *\\"Vestas\\", without the capital, appear in Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes short story \\"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\\" (1892), and finding a half-burned one is one of the clues that helps solve the crime.

EMI currently exists for the artists that it signed pre-2012, effectively becoming an in-name-only unit of Sony/ATV Music Publishing. EMI Music Publishing controls over 2 million songs; including classic songs by Queen, Carole King and the Motown catalog, along with contemporary releases by Kanye West, Blink 182, Drake, Sia, P!nk, Pharrell Williams, and Calvin Harris. EMI also owns the recorded catalogue of Philles Records, with distribution handled by Sony's Legacy Recordings. History = Founding = The origins of EMI Music Publishing date back to the EMI Group's entry into music publishing in 1958 through the formation of Ardmore and Beechwood. In 1969, EMI greatly expanded its presence in music publishing through the acquisition of Keith Prowse Music for US$1.2 million in cash and 70,000 ordinary stock units. In 1973, EMI acquired Francis, Day & Hunter Ltd. In 1973, EMI acquired Affiliated Music Publishers for US$8.75 million. In 1974, EMI renamed its music publishing division as EMI Music Publishing. In 1976, EMI Music Publishing acquired the Screen Gems and Colgems music libraries from Columbia Pictures, making it a major publisher of film music. In 1989, EMI acquired SBK Entertainment, which included the MGM musical catalog. In May 2011, EMI Music Publishing began bundling performance rights previously represented by ASCAP with mechanical and synchronization rights. = LBO by Terra Firma in 2007 = In 2007, EMI agreed to be purchased by Terra Firma, a UK-based private equity, beating out Warner and others. The deal value was about $6.5 billion, including $4.7 billion for the shares listed in the London stock exchange, and about $2 billion of debt. The deal represented a very high multiple of EBITDA, meaning it added large debt to EMI. After defaulting on its debt, Citigroup took over in early 2011 and weeks later announced that EMI would be split and sold off separately (music recording from the one hand, publishing on the other). = Acquisition by Sony and others in 2012 = In November 2011, a consortium led by Sony agreed to acquire EMI Music Publishing from Citigroup, the owners of the EMI Group, for US$2.2 billion. (EMI Records was sold separately.) The acquisition was approved by the European Commission in April 2012,Joshua R. Wueller, Mergers of Majors: Applying the Failing Firm Doctrine in the Recorded Music Industry, 7 Brook. J. Corp. Fin. & Com. L. 589, 602 (2013). conditional upon the divestiture of the worldwide publishing rights to four catalogues - Famous Music UK, Virgin Europe, Virgin Music Publishing UK and Virgin US - and the musical works of 12 contemporary authors, including Bullet for My Valentine, Gary Barlow, Ben Harper, the Kooks, Lenny Kravitz, Ozzy Osbourne, Placebo (Famous Music), and Robbie Williams. Those catalogues, collectively known as \\"Rosetta\\", were acquired by BMG Rights Management in December 2012; the deal was finalized in May 2013. The acquisition was completed in June 2012 following receipt of necessary approvals from anti-trust regulators in the United States. Sony, through its Sony/ATV Music Publishing unit, acquired about 30% of EMI Publishing. Still, it won the administration of the entire catalog, making Sony/ATV the largest music publishing administrator in the world. Other owners of EMI Publishing include Abu Dhabi wealth fund Mubadala, the Michael Jackson Estate, financial institutions, and billionaire David Geffen. = Other developments = Jho Low, owner of Jynwel Capital, was charged by the US government in civil proceedings as part of the 1Malaysia Development Berhard (1MDB) scandal. The government attempted to seize Jynwel's stake in EMI Music, claiming it used illicit funds. In July 2017, media reported that EMI Music was put up for sale. In March 2018, Mubadala Investment Co., an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund who was one of the buyers of EMI Publishing in 2012, has held talks with Sony and approached other possible buyers to sell its entire stake, according to the media. Mubadala is reportedly seeking a valuation of at least $4 billion, almost twice what the Sony-led group paid six years before. The process cannot formally start before end June 2018. EMI Publishing reportedly owns more than 2.1 million songs. In August 2018, the Independent Music Companies Association (IMPALA) filed a complaint to the European Commission, asking them to block Sony/ATV's full acquisition of EMI. Warner Music Group and BMG Rights Management, which both acquired parts of EMI and its publisher in 2013, have also objected to the acquisition. In October 2018, the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors also objected to the buyout. Sony declined to offer any concessions to the European Commission, which will decide whether it will launch a full-scale investigation into the deal on 26 October. Operations As of May 2018, EMI Music Publishing included the publishing rights to over 2.1 million songs. Its day-to-day operations, including the administration of songs, are delegated to Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Awards EMI Music Publishing was named Publisher of the Year by Music Week every year for over 10 years; in 2009, EMI tied with Universal Music Publishing for the award.

Within the United States, the college version of basketball annually garners high television ratings. Not all games are televised. Coverage is dependent on negotiations between the broadcaster and the college basketball conference or team. In general, major programs will be televised more often than smaller programs. The televised games may change from year-to- year depending on which teams are having a strong season, although some traditional rivalry games are broadcast each year. Major match-ups between top-ranked teams or major rivals are often broadcast nationally. Some games are traditionally associated with a specific event or holiday, and viewing the game itself can become a holiday tradition for fans. History College basketball was first televised during the \\"experimental\\" era of television's broadcasting history, when W2XBS broadcast a men's basketball doubleheader from Madison Square Garden in New York City on February 28, 1940. Fordham University and the University of Pittsburgh played in the first game, and New York University played Georgetown University in the second game.American Sportscasters Online: Sportscasting Firsts 1940 College Basketball Recap on Infoplease In 1968, the \\"Game of the Century\\", played between UCLA and Houston, was syndicated by the TVS Television Network, attracting a significant television audience. The game is widely cited as a catalyst for the explosion and expansion of the televised college basketball landscape. Broadcast rights =Networks= In addition, some regional syndicators broadcast games on over the air television. Most notably, Raycom Sports syndicate their games to broadcast stations. ESPN Plus, which was a syndication unit of ESPN, also previously syndicated basketball games from various conferences to stations until its 2014 closure in the wake of Big 12 games moving to the ESPN cable networks, and the inception of the cable-only SEC Network. In 2014, Sinclair Broadcasting launched a new syndication programming service, the American Sports Network, to syndicate basketball games in various areas of the country, including a few NCAA Division II games (beginning in 2016). Raycom in the early 1990s paid ABC $1.8 million for six weeks of network airtime of 26 regional games. The format allowed Raycom to control the games and sell the advertising. =Cable stations= Regional cable networks have long devoted coverage to one or two conferences. The Pac-12 and Big 12 have had deals with Fox Sports since 1996, which airs games on its regional family of networks. In 2007, the Big Ten conference was the first to establish its own television network, the Big Ten Network. The Pac-12 Networks debuted in 2012. Two years later, ESPN and the Southeastern Conference launched the SEC Network. In August 2019, the ACC has launched the ACC Network. This network will replace the games currently broadcast by Raycom Sports. The Big Ten has a similar regional network, with the Big Ten Network having made its debut in August 2007. Texas has their own deal which created the Longhorn Network in fall of 2011. While BYU has BYUtv, it is not a separate deal that created a regional sports network. ESPN ESPN has been airing regular season games since 1980, ESPN2 since 1993, ESPNU since 2005, and to a lesser extent ESPN Classic will show fewer games per season. College basketball has been a staple for nearly the whole history of ESPN. Scotty Connal, then-vice president of the all-sports network in Bristol, Conn., offered Dick Vitale a position, shortly after being fired from the Detroit Pistons.

A precocious, award-winning, young author in interwar Romania, he was involved in editing several literary magazines. Attracted into left-wing democratic politics and the Social Democratic Party (PSDR), he camouflaged his views while working for the fascist press under dictatorial regimes, but returned in 1944 to manage the PSDR's Libertatea newspaper. Witnessing first- hand the gradual communist takeover, Baciu managed to have himself assigned to a diplomatic posting in Switzerland, and ultimately defected in 1948. A resident and then citizen of Brazil, and a traveler throughout Latin America, he wrote works in Portuguese, Spanish, English and German, as well as in his native Romanian. Involved with the Congress for Cultural Freedom and a friend of independent socialists such as Juan Bosch, Baciu spoke out against South American communism and criticized Fidel Castro. He eventually moved to the United States, as a professor at the University of Washington, and, from 1964, the University of Hawaii. He put out the international magazine Mele, which, although rudimentarily printed and little circulated, remains a noted source of information about avant-garde writers of the Romanian diaspora, from Andrei Codrescu to Dolfi Trost and Sesto Pals. Baciu was also a preeminent historian and anthologist of South and Central American surrealism, as well as a translator of Latin American literature into Romanian and German. Biography =Early life= »òtefan Baciu was born in Bra»ôov, some months before the city became part of Greater Romania. His was a multicultural intellectual family. His father was the ethnic Romanian Ioan Baciu, a product of Austro-Hungarian schooling, was at the time a teacher of German at the »òaguna National College.Spiridon & Toader, p. 161 He is remembered at the co- author of a pioneering introductory Romanian textbook for the benefit of Saxons and Hungarians.\\"Legendele Bra»ôovului: Poet celebru √Æn America LatinƒÉ\\", in Gazeta Bra»ôovului, Nr. 19/2012 In 1930, he built for his family the \\"Yellow House\\" in Lunca PlƒÉie»ôului residential property, which had recently been opened for settlement. The poet's mother, Elisabeta, was the daughter of the forestry engineer Arthur Sager; his maternal aunt, Lenu»õa K√∂nig, was a corsetmaker for Queen Marie.Gligor & Caloianu, p. 165 Baciu's sister, Ioana Veronica, had a successful career in the theater.

It was indebted to surrealist automatism and by Andr√© Gide's rebellious philosophy. Start functioned as a local satellite of I. Valerian's Via»õa LiterarƒÉ, which had appointed Baciu its official correspondent and publicity agent for the whole of Transylvania. Struggling with financial difficulties, Start did not survive beyond its second issue. Baciu moved on to publish other magazines, alongside VintilƒÉ Horia, Mihai Beniuc, and Ovid Caledoniu: Stilet (\\"Stiletto\\"), then Me»ôterul Manole (named after the folk legend hero). Additionally, he was a contributor to literary magazines and newspapers across Romania, including G√¢nd Rom√¢nesc, Glasul Bucovinei, Rampa, and George Iva»ôcu's Manifest. At age seventeen, Baciu had his Poemele poetului t√¢nƒÉr (\\"Poems of the Young Poet\\") picked up in a \\"young poets' anthology\\", and put out by the official publishing company, Editura Funda»õiilor Regale.Boia, p. 117 He was presented with the company's own Young Writers Award and received the Romanian Writers' Society Poetry Prize. He followed up in 1936 with Poeme de dragoste (\\"Love Poems\\"), published by Familia of Oradea, and in 1937 with Micul dor (\\"A Tiny Longing\\"). Iordan Datcu, \\"Vladimir Streinu cenzurat\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 25/2002Spiridon & Toader, p. 170 Also that year, he was included in the anthology 13 poe»õi, with Horia, Caledoniu, Constantin Virgil Gheorghiu, Simion Stolnicu, Dumitru Gherghinescu-Vania and various others. =Under fascism= Young Baciu was soon received into the cultural elite of Bucharest, befriending the likes of PƒÉstorel Teodoreanu and Ion Minulescu. Alongside Caledoniu, George Petcu, Maria Banu»ô, Lauren»õiu Fulga and some others, Baciu was also drawn into the \\"White Nights Manifesto\\" circle, which sought to promote young literature. Also faced with financial troubles, and unsuccessful in its bid to receive state funding, the circle closed shop in 1938. M. Cosmescu Delasabar, \\"George Petcu »ôi Manifestul Nop»õii Albe\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 29/1999 Baciu had since enlisted at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Law, whence he graduated in 1941. His college years overlapped with the demise of Romanian democracy and several authoritarian experiments, the first of which was a National Renaissance Front dictatorship. By late 1938, Miron Neagu, \\"Din arhiva Emil Giurgiuca\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 51-52/2006 Baciu had begun collaborating in the semi-official newspaper, SfarmƒÉ-PiatrƒÉ, published by the fascist sympathizer Nichifor Crainic. He had a literary history column, Cronici germane (\\"German Chronicles\\"), with which he aimed to popularize \\"that superb German Romanticism\\".»òtefan Baciu, \\"Cronici germane. Cuv√¢nt de √Ænceput\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 43/1939, p. 2 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) He was in correspondence with a more senior poet, Emil Giurgiuca, offering to popularize Giurgiuca's work \\"in SfarmƒÉ-PiatrƒÉ or wherever\\". Also in 1938, Baciu collected his translations from Georg Trakl, which came out at Editura Frize in Ia»ôi.Spiridon & Toader, p. 171 Having openly supported the Iron Guard as a radical fascist alternative to the establishment, SfarmƒÉ-PiatrƒÉ was also falling into disfavor with the National Renaissance Front regime. Early in 1939, following bloody clashes between the Front and the Guardists, SfarmƒÉ- PiatrƒÉ was outlawed. Baciu moved to the more mainstream Universul, becoming its editor and resuming Cronici germane in its literary supplement. He also held the literary criticism column, taking over from »òtefan Augustin Doina»ô. Mircea Popa, \\"Alte inedite »òtefan Augustin Doina»ô\\", in Apostrof, Nr. 7/2013 During the early stages of World War II, Crainic gave Baciu the office of editorial secretary at G√¢ndirea magazine, but sacked him upon finding out about his Social Democratic loyalties.Spiridon & Toader, p. 163 According to communist sources, Baciu was himself an affiliate or sympathizer of the Iron Guard‚Äîa claim that has since been disputed; Baciu's PSDR membership and his mother's Jewishness disqualified him for such an enterprise.Spiridon & Toader, pp. 163‚Äì164 By his own account, Baciu was a malagambist, meaning that he followed the zoot-clad jazzman Sergiu Malagamba and had cosmopolitan, Americophile tastes. George CiorƒÉnescu, Crisula »òtefƒÉnescu, \\"»òtefan Baciu, un poet rom√¢n din America LatinƒÉ\\", in Cultura, Nr. 297, October 2010 He did however befried the Guard's poet laureate, Radu Gyr, helping him publish in G√¢ndirea even after the Guard's violent fall from grace in early 1941.\\"Centenar Radu Gyr\\", in Biblioteca Bucure»ôtilor, Nr. 3/2005, pp. 13‚Äì14 Upon his graduation, Baciu became translator for the Institute of Statistics (under Sabin ManuilƒÉ), cultural adviser for the General Council of Bucharest, and publisher for the companies Gorjanul and Publicom. His poetic work was collected in the volumes Drume»õ √Æn anotimpuri (\\"A Traveler through Seasons\\", 1939), CƒÉutƒÉtorul de comori (\\"The Treasure Hunter\\", 1939), Cetatea lui Bucur (\\"Bucur's Citadel\\", 1940), and Muzica sferelor (\\"Music of the Spheres\\", 1943). Attracted by the prospects of a good pay in the only thriving literary industry of the war years, he began contributing to the humorous press. He debuted in Virgil SlƒÉvescu's PƒÉcalƒÉ, as \\"Grigore CumpƒÉna»ôu\\", and later held columns in Veselia and Ion Anestin's Gluma.Popa, pp. 90‚Äì91 While at university, Baciu had met and fallen in love with Mira Simian (born 1920). The daughter of Dinu Simian, a National Peasants' Party politician from V√¢lcea County, heir to a tanning and footwear-making empire,Constantin Mateescu, \\"Oahu\\", in Acolada, Nr. 1/2011 and his Polish wife, Mira attended the Bucharest Faculty of Letters, then worked as a pharmacist in R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea. She married Baciu upon the war's end.LazƒÉr, pp. 293‚Äì294 =PSDR journalist, diplomat, defector= The August 23, 1944 Coup unsealed Romania's alliance with Nazi Germany, and brought back democracy, but also signified the onset of Soviet occupation. Shortly after the legalization of political parties, Baciu became editor of the Social Democratic press organ Libertatea (\\"Liberty\\").Boia, p. 253; Spiridon & Toader, p. 162 From October 1944 to December 1945, he edited his own illustrated satirical review, Humorul (\\"Humor\\"). Meanwhile, he also put out new selections from his poetry: C√¢ntecul mul»õimii (\\"Song of the Crowd\\"), with a preface by Ion Pas, came out at the PSDR party press in 1944; Caiet de vacan»õƒÉ (\\"Notebook for the Holidays\\") at Unirea of R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea in 1945. His circle of acquaintances grew to include some members of the Bucharest surrealist circle, in particular Sesto Pals (who was Baciu's lifelong friend) Micha√´l Finkenthal, \\"Sesto Pals sau poezia omului ciudat\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 169, May 2003 and Dolfi Trost. Cornel Ungureanu, \\"Michael Finkenthal, de la Fundoianu »ôi »òestov la Trost »ôi Sesto Pals\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 19/2014 With his party falling under the influence of Romanian Communists, Baciu remained close to the independent pro- Western wing, under Constantin Titel Petrescu.FrunzƒÉ, pp. 275, 279‚Äì280; LazƒÉr, p. 294 As he would note in 1992, Baciu had always been \\"an adept of democratic socialism\\".Spiridon & Toader, p. 165 He referred to Petrescu as \\"the tocsin- sounder of the great perils that were knocking on our door, perils not just for the existence of social democracy, but also of Romania's very existence as a free democratic state\\".FrunzƒÉ, p. 275 Baciu described with alarm the rapid communization of his writer friends, recording Beniuc's enthusiasm at seeing liberal demonstrators being repressed with machine guns.Boia, p. 265 He also witnessed the desperation of his friend Gyr, who attempted suicide in R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea. However, according to literary historian Mircea Popa, Baciu's Libertatea editorials were of that kind \\"that would later shame him\\": young Baciu ridiculed the prewar regime as an era of conformity and \\"nothingness\\", and even praised socialist realism.Popa, p. 92‚Äì93 At the time, Communist Party politicians tempted him with offers to become Prefect or theater manager.Popa, p. 92 Baciu was present at the PSDR Congress of March 10, 1946, which resulted in the party's electoral alliance with the Communists. His testimony describes Petrescu's anti-fusion speech as the point of view of a \\"good and courageous Romanian\\". Baciu further recalls: \\"I walked [Petrescu] back to his home alongside some hundreds of partisans\\".FrunzƒÉ, pp. 279‚Äì280 In October 1946, owing to his Social Democratic credentials, Baciu was appointed press officer of the Romanian Embassy in Bern. The ambassador was »òerban Voinea, a PSDR theoretician. Baciu conceived of this assignment as a safe haven from communism, but was still troubled about leaving Romania and his relatives. He brought up the issue in conversations with Petrescu, who advised him: \\"Forget [Mira's] pharmacy, choose freedom.\\" His appointment became the object of disputes between Communist-controlled agencies and Foreign Affairs, which was still controlled by an ally, Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu. As Baciu recalls, TƒÉtƒÉrescu gave him and his wife tacit backing, without signing any papers, and discreetly handed them their diplomatic passports. On November 5, the Bacius crossed into Hungary semi-clandestinely, knowing that they risked being returned at the border. The Petru Groza government was only informed later of their arrival in Bern. Like Voinea, Baciu had open disagreements with his Bucharest superiors, complaining that his efforts to publicize Romanian literature in the Swiss \\"workers' press\\" were not being supported by the Romanian state. He wrote for the editorial section of Tribune de Gen√®ve, to dissuade Swiss fears about the stabilization of the Romanian leu. The communist authorities later accused him of purposefully withholding information, \\"thus giving reactionaries reason to minimize this important reform\\". In late 1947, just before the proclamation of a Romanian communist republic, Voinea resigned his posting. Baciu, who was recalled and assigned to a new post in Sofia, opted to discontinue his work in diplomacy and demand political asylum in Switzerland. He was advised to do so by a friend, Victor Popescu (son of Universul editor Stelian Popescu). =Brazilian exile= The Bacius registered their case with the International Refugee Organization (IRO), who processed them to determine if they were or had been undercover agents of a secret service.LazƒÉr, p. 294 During the interval, Baciu was publishing essays and in Literarische Tat, and Mira was working for the Zytglogge pharmacy. The Bacius simultaneously applied for asylum in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela (meanwhile, Mira's uncles had managed to escape to Argentina). Cleared by the IRO in early 1949, the Bacius were given asylum rights in Brazil, and arrived at Rio de Janeiro in March. They had a rough start in the new country, and struggled to make ends meet. »òtefan Baciu resumed his work in poetry, translating Latin American novellas into German and Ra√∫l Otero Reiche's Am√©rica into Romanian, and publishing his own surrealist works, including Analiza cuv√¢ntului dor (Valle Hermoso, 1951).Spiridon & Toader, pp. 164, 170, 171 In late 1952, alongside Faust BrƒÉdescu, he was editing √én»ôir-te MƒÉrgƒÉrite, a magazine for the Romanian Brazilian community, which also reached Romanian communities from Argentina to Francoist Spain. Its stated purpose was the preservation and publicizing of Romanian poetry and prose. Romania's Securitate secret police, which was following his movements, noted BrƒÉdescu's Iron Guard affiliation as a sign of Baciu's own fascism.Spiridon & Toader, p. 164 Also in 1953, Baciu was made editor of the foreign politics page at Carlos Lacerda's Tribuna da Imprensa.Cancelli, pp. 79‚Äì80; Spiridon & Toader, p. 164 According to the Securitate, this was a \\"newspaper of the fascist kind\\". He published occasional contributions to Revista da Semana, Di√°rio Carioca, and Maquis, and, in 1957, two volumes of his Portuguese-language poetry: Aula de solid√£o (\\"Lesson in Solitude\\"), Dois Guatemaltecos (\\"Two Guatemalans\\").Spiridon & Toader, pp. 164, 170 Meanwhile, Mira Baciu worked as a translator for the Deputies' Chamber. With Tribuna da Imprensa credentials, Baciu traveled across Latin America. In Mexico, he interviewed Natalia Sedova, widow of Leon Trotsky. In 1956, he was at Lima, where he met the Romanian writer-violinist Grigore Cugler. The two began a correspondence, with Baciu persuading Cugler to republish his 1930s avant-garde stories. Cristian Livescu, \\"Avangarda solitarƒÉ: poezia lui Grigore Cugler, 'simbolul √Ænsu»ôi al exilului deplin'\\", in Convorbiri Literare, May 2011 He prepared for publishing Cugler's AfarƒÉ de unul singur, but the manuscript was lost in the process (although an earlier print was eventually recovered in 1998). Ion Simu»õ, \\"Al doilea Urmuz\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 23/2004 Baciu also embarked on a mission to popularize Romanian avant-garde writers, publishing Spanish and Portuguese essays about Urmuz and Constant Tonegaru. By then, Baciu was also involved with the anti- authoritarian left-wing movement on the South American continent. As he saw it, the caudillo regimes of Alfredo Stroessner, Juan Per√≥n or Anastasio Somoza were generally equivalent to Eastern European Stalinism.Baciu (1967), p. 19 Together with Salvadorean diplomat Rafael Barraza Monterrosa, the Bacius managed a Panhispanist association, called Ruy Barbosa Circle, building personal contacts with Juan Bosch, the exiled Dominican socialist,Baciu (1967), p. 93; LazƒÉr, p. 294 and Carlos M√©rida, the Guatemalan painter.Baciu (1983), p. 11 In 1956, he had an encounter with Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro, and became a sympathizer of his 26th of July Movement. =CCF and Cuban Revolution= The Bacius were eventually granted Brazilian citizenship, and became fully integrated in Brazil's cultural life. The couple counted among their writer friends Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Manuel Bandeira and Cec√≠lia Meireles. In April 1958, Baciu, Meireles and Bandeira were among the 42 intellectuals who set up a Brazilian chapter of the anticommunist Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), which, from 1959, put out the Portuguese-language review Cadernos Brasileiros.Cancelli, pp. 72‚Äì73, 79‚Äì80 The organization was in part funded by the Central Intelligence Agency, through its Paris agent, John Hunt (with whom Baciu corresponded), and answered directly to the Spaniard Juli√°n Gorkin.Cancelli, pp. 80‚Äì81 Baciu joined the staff of Cadernos as editor in chief (with Afr√¢nio Coutinho as editorial manager) and was General Secretary of the CCF until August 1962;Cancelli, pp. 79‚Äì80, 109‚Äì110 Mira was the Executive Secretary. Baciu was with Bosch in Venezuela, celebrating R√≥mulo Betancourt's victory in the election of December 1958.Baciu (1967), pp. 11, 29, 44‚Äì46, 55‚Äì56 Together with Bosch, he organized a negative campaign against the Republic of Cuba, but Bosch refused any explicit endorsement of Castro's guerrilla.Baciu (1967), p. 11 In January 1959, following the success of the Cuban Revolution, Baciu was invited by the new government in Havana, to report on the work of the revolutionary tribunals. He declined the invitation but, later that year, he made his way there to interview Castro. He recorded in particular Castro's disdain for the Cuban Communists. In March, he happened to meet Castro's communist inspiration, Che Guevara, but they only discussed literature. Also in 1959, Baciu published in Rio the essay Um continente em busca de uma doutrina (\\"A Continent Searching for a Doctrine\\").Cancelli, p. 79 In 1960, he was awarded honorary citizenship of Rio. He was working on the book of memoirs in Portuguese, Bucareste-Esta√ß√£o Norte (\\"Bucharest-Northern Station\\"), which came out at Edi√ß√µes o Cruzeiro in 1961.Spiridon & Toader, pp. 163, 171 Meanwhile, Baciu's Romanian relatives were suffering under communist persecution. Dinu Simian was mistreated and tortured in Sighet prison, where he eventually died; Dinu's wife, Constan»õa, was also detained, and, upon her 1962 release, had to struggle to make ends meet. In 1962, through the intercession of Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek, Mira Baciu persuaded the Romanian authorities to grant her mother safe passage to Brazil. With his 1961 reportage Cortina de hierro sobre Cuba (\\"The Iron Curtain over Cuba\\"), prefaced by Salvador de Madariaga, Baciu made public his criticism of Castroist communism, and condemned its spread to other Latin American nations.Spiridon & Toader, pp. 164‚Äì165, 171 He rendered it even more explicit in the poem Eu nu √Æl c√Ænt pe Che (\\"I Do Not Sing for Che\\"), known in Spanish as Yo no canto al Ch√©.Mar√≠a Elena Cruz Varela, \\"La Sangrieta saga del Coma- andante Castro\\", in Revista Hispano-cubana, Nr. 16, May‚ÄìSeptember 2003, pp. 39‚Äì40 This change of attitudes was radical, as Baciu moved to confront the communists directly, and, in his letters to Gorkin, stated his desire to purge the CCF itself of \\"camouflaged\\" Brazilian Communists.Cancelli, pp. 81, 83 Such ideas alarmed the CIA, since they risked alienating the anticommunist left. John Hunt and Keith Botsford repeatedly asked Baciu to focus on anti-Casto, rather than \\"right-wing\\", propaganda (Hunt referred to Baciu as \\"a right-wing democratic socialist\\", a Betancourt associate, and a \\"maniac\\").Cancelli, pp. 81‚Äì82 By then, the Brazilian CCF was vulnerable, its CIA connections brought up for public debate by communist intellectuals like Jorge Amado and Eg√≠dio Squeff.Cancelli, pp. 85‚Äì86 Although he did not formally adhere to any Romanian anticommunist organization, Baciu was in correspondence with Constantin Vi»ôoianu and the Romanian National Committee, publishing anticommunist essays in the latter's Rom√¢nia gazette. Allegedly, Baciu found himself threatened by the Cuban Intelligence Directorate.LazƒÉr, p. 295 However, it was Baciu's extreme anticommunism that prompted Hunt to demand his resignation and appoint Vicente de Paulo Barretto as the new CCF General Secretary.Cancelli, pp. 82‚Äì83, 85‚Äì86 Baciu later commented that the CCF had committed \\"suicide\\" by moderating its tone, noting that its \\"constructive dialogue with proven communists\\" was a moral victory for \\"Eurocommunism\\".Cancelli, p. 83 =Between Seattle and Honolulu= Baciu's Rio colleagues backed him in his bid for the Brazilian literature chair at the University of Washington. He obtained it, and moved to Seattle, where Mira began her own career as a Spanish-language teacher.LazƒÉr, pp. 294‚Äì295 However, Mira detested the Oceanic climate, and the couple was often taking trips back to Latin America. In 1963, Baciu and his wife were in Santo Domingo, celebrating Bosch's victory in the Dominican presidential suffrage.Baciu (1967), passim Afterwards, they also visited neighboring Haiti, where Baciu was trying to recover for publishing the obscure surrealist works of Cl√©ment Magloire-Saint-Aude.Baciu (1983), pp. 10, 11 The same year, Baciu published in Mexico City his poetic cycle Poemele poetului pribeag (\\"Poems of the Outcast Poet\\"). In 1964, Baciu obtained a professorship in Latin American literature at the newly founded University of Hawaii. He enjoyed his work there, but felt bad about the smaller attendance his classes inevitably received. In 1965, the Bacius set up their own magazine, International Poetry Letter ‚Äì Mele (from the Hawaiian for \\"song\\"), which sought to establish connections between Latino, French, American and Romanian literature. Although noted for the quality of its illustrations, Mele had a very minor circulation, with at most 300 copies per issue, all of them xerographed by Baciu's students. Mele sought to popularize Romanian authors, and, doubling as a publishing house, put out periodic selections from Baciu's own poems in Romanian and Spanish. Baciu helped discover and popularize Andrei Codrescu, the neo-avant-garde Romanian exile writer. Cosmin Ciotlo»ô, \\"Un poet nemaipomenit\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 19/2006 Florina P√Ærjol, \\"Tripla lansare Andrei Codrescu\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 265, March 2005 In 1967, the Bacius' home in Honolulu hosted Valeriu Anania, the writer and abbot of the Romanian Orthodox Church in America. A former Iron Guard man and prisoner of the communists, released with the spell of liberalization in 1964, Anania was treating his depression in Hawaii. »òtefan Cazimir, \\"'Ce straniu poate fi destinul unui om!'\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 6/2009 Paul Cernat, \\"Cartea vie»õii lui Valeriu Anania\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 465, March 2009 He was putting to paper a novel and poetry that he had \\"written inside his brain\\" while in jail, and doing research into Hawaiian folklore. Anania later recalled that Mira Baciu had fallen in love with him, and that he had to fend off her advances while remaining friends with her and her husband. Baciu returned to Romanian-language publishing with the 1967 Ukulele, put out by George UscƒÉtescu's Editura Destin in Spain. He also made a comeback to Portuguese letters with the 1966 essay Manuel Bandeira de corpo inteiro (\\"The Complete Manuel Bandeira\\"). He followed up with a 1967 essay on the politics of Juan Bosch and Spanish-language poetry volumes, Semblanza y explicaci√≥n de Latinoam√©rica (\\"A Profile and Explanation of Latin America\\") of 1968 and the 1973 Nasserismo (\\"Nasserism\\"). In 1972, he published in Madrid's Colec»õia Start a complete collection of his Romanian poems. They featured a preface by Lucian Boz and a portrait by Marcel Janco. Baciu also translated Romanian poetry into Spanish, and published several anthologies, beginning with the 1969 Poetas rumanos.Spiridon & Toader, pp. 165, 171 He was under contract with publishing houses in West Germany, such as Peter Hammer and Neues Leben, translating for them five volumes of poetry by Ernesto Cardenal. =Anthologist= Inspired by an encounter with French surrealist Benjamin P√©ret,Baciu (1983), pp. 8‚Äì9 Baciu had begun a vast work of research into the history of Latin American avant-garde literature, and spent some time in Peru and Bolivia. By his own account, he interviewed \\"my great friend\\" Trist√°n Marof, Luis Alberto S√°nchez, Javier Sologuren and Emilio Adolfo Westphalen, and helped rediscover the anticommunist surrealist Rafael M√©ndez Dorich.»òtefan Baciu, \\"¬´Rafo¬ª M√©ndez, soldat inconnu du surr√©alisme p√©ruvien\\", in M√©lusine. Cahiers du Centre de recherche sur le surr√©alisme, Nr. 1/1979, pp. 221‚Äì226 As noted by Sologuren, Baciu's studies also helped revive interest in the poetry of C√©sar Moro.Javier Sologuren, Obras completas de Javier Sologuren, VII, Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, Lima, 2005, pp. 349, 370. In Argentina, Baciu befriended Aldo Pellegrini, who let him discover early avant- garde texts by Jorge Luis Borges and \\"the extraordinary\\" Antonio Porchia.Baciu (1983), p. 10 Pellegrini also introduced him to Enrique G√≥mez Correa and the Chilean surrealist scene. Introduced to Jean Charlot by M√©rida, Baciu researched the history of Mexican muralism, and discovered the proto- surrealism of Jos√© Guadalupe Posada. He was still following with interest the work of writers in Romania, and published his translations of neomodernist Romanian literature in a special issue of Peru's Haraui review. Baciu also followed the work of Romanians who translated Latino literature into Romanian. He found these attempts inauthentic and superficial, and criticized them in the 1970 essay Brazilia masacrata. To the irritation of Editura Dacia publishers, he mailed them copies of this critique.Spiridon & Toader, pp. 166‚Äì167 Baciu later exposed communist censorship, noting for instance the cuts that had been made into the published diaries of »òulu»õiu, and the exclusion of concrete poetry from the Brazilian anthologies of Darie NovƒÉceanu.Spiridon & Toader, p. 167 As he put it, \\"I believe it a duty of the exile writer to defend the Romanian language from the 'party-minded' invasion of the mediocrities, the boot-lickers, the savvy ones and the profiteers, be they talented or talentless.\\" Baciu's inclusion in a poetry anthology, put out in Bucharest by Nicolae Manolescu, scandalized the communist apparatus; the work was soon withdrawn from bookstores by the censors.Monica Lovinescu, Unde scurte, Humanitas, Bucharest, 1990, pp. 340‚Äì344. Nevertheless, the new communist regime of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu made some efforts to appease Baciu and enlist him to write \\"propaganda for Romanian art and culture during the years of socialist consolidation\\", and even allowed Romanian journalists to contact him on the phone. Baciu claimed to have cut short such attempts, identifying them as a Securitate diversion. His rejection did not prevent Iron Guard loyalists such as Horia Stamatu from labeling Baciu a spy and avoiding all contact with him.\\"I. P. Culianu ‚Äì M. L. Ricketts Correspondence\\" (letter of January 19, 1988), in Mihaela Gligor (ed.), Mircea Eliade between the History of Religions and the Fall into History, Presa UniversitarƒÉ ClujeanƒÉ, Cluj- Napoca, 2014, p. 147. In 1974, Baciu ultimately put out at SUNY Press an overall anthology of Latin American poetry (Antolog√≠a de la poes√≠a latinoamericana), and at Editorial Joaqu√≠n Mortiz, in Mexico City, a critical anthology of Latin American surrealism, Antolog√≠a de la poes√≠a surrealista latinoamericana.Spiridon & Toader, p. 166 The latter book was enthusiastically reviewed in Plural magazine by the writer Octavio Paz, who noted that it was \\"indispensable\\" to the study of local surrealism and that it marked the \\"end of gossip\\" about the phenomenon. Octavio Paz, \\"Sobre el surrealismo hispanoamericano: El fin de las habladur√≠as\\", in Plural, Nr. 35/1974 (republished by the University of Chile, La Mandr√°gora project) It is seen by literary historians as \\"orthodox\\" in comparison with Pellegrini's earlier chrestomathy.Editor notes to Leslie Bethell (ed.), The Cambridge History of Latin America, 10, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge etc., 1995, pp. 266, 588. In 1975, he edited in Madrid posthumous reissue of Cugler's Vi-l prezint pe »öeavƒÉ. The following year, at San Jos√©, Baciu put out a volume of his own essays on Costa Rica. Meanwhile, Mira Baciu, who discovered her artistic talents and became Mele illustrator, had completed her specialization at the University of Strasbourg under Jacques Borel, she lectured in Spanish language, then became a professor of French. She befriended artist Jacques H√©rold, who illustrated her poetry volume of 1973, Houla, Macumba, Hora. She died of cancer, on July 2, 1978, bequeathing her estate to fund a Romanian literature scholarship at the University of Hawaii.LazƒÉr, p. 296 Mira's death left Baciu in near-complete isolation from the Romanian-speaking public. As he later noted: \\"I literally have no one to whom I would read the things I write. There are at most ten Romanian speakers living in Honolulu and none of them, absolutely none, has ever been to a bookstore or a library to peek into, or to ask for, or to purchase a single book of poetry.\\" He honored her memory with a 1979 semi-autobiographical novel, eponymously titled Mira.LazƒÉr, p. 293 A new volume of his memoirs saw print in Honolulu in 1980, as Praful de pe tobƒÉ (\\"The Dust on the Drum\\").FrunzƒÉ, pp. 566, 567; Spiridon & Toader, p. 171 It was taped by Virgil Ierunca and serialized by Radio Free Europe (RFE), which broadcast clandestinely into Romania. In 1979, Antolog√≠a de la poes√≠a surrealista latinoamericana was reissued by the University of Valpara√≠so. Baciu also issued a new chrestomathy of Romanian-to-Spanish translations: 11+11 poetas rumanos contempor√°neos, published by the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN).Spiridon & Toader, pp. 165, 169 In addition to putting out Mele and his own works therein, Baciu published the Spanish- language collection of his poetry, El que pierde gana (\\"He Who Loses Wins\\", UNAN, 1978) and Pasaporte y p√£nuelo (\\"Passport and Handkerchief\\", Revista Conservadora del Pensamiento Centroamericano, 1982).Spiridon & Toader, pp. 170‚Äì171 He returned to Portuguese-language writing in 1982, with Carioca honor√°rio (\\"An Honorary Carioca\\"), which came out in 1982 at Pernambuco's Edi√ß√µes Pirata, and Lavradio 98, a memoir of his work under Lacerda, at Editora Nova Fronteira of Rio. These were followed in 1984 by Un rumano en el Istmo (\\"A Romanian in the Isthmus\\"), at Universidad Veracruzana; and in 1985 by translations from Lucian Blaga (co-written with Eugenio Montejo), at Fundarte of Caracas,Spiridon & Toader, pp. 171, 173 and a Heredia University biography of Francisco Amighetti. Among Baciu's later contributions include several essays such as Centroamericanos (San Jos√©, 1986) and a biography of Trist√°n Marof (La Paz, 1987). =Final years= Throughout the late 1970s and early '80s, despite Baciu's isolation, Mele managed to obtain collaborations from many other Romanian writers, acquiring a relevant role in Romanian literary history. It hosted selections from the poetry of George CiorƒÉnescu, who was at the time a chronicler for RFE. CiorƒÉnescu returned the favor by popularizing Baciu's work in one of his broadcasts. Mele was especially noted for its reissue of works by the 1940s Romanian avant-garde. Baciu repeatedly tried to persuade Sesto Pals, who had returned to his regular job as an engineer, to publish a selection of his lifetime works. The May 1985 issue of Mele was entirely dedicated to Pals' poetry.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, pp. 172, 200 Baciu also tracked down and interviewed poet-draftsman Paul PƒÉun, who, like Pals, moved from Romania to Israel.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, pp. 158, 169, 199 However, his friendship with Lucian Boz had deteriorated from 1978, when Mele hosted a piece by C√©sar Tiempo, seen by Boz as \\"ferociously antisemitic\\". Baciu maintained a close relationship with dissidents and avant-garde writers in his native Romania‚Äîover 100 people, according to concerned Securitate operatives. Such figures include Nicolae Carandino, Alexandru Paleologu, Radu Tudoran, Corneliu Coposu, Ion Dezideriu S√Ærbu, Constantin Noica, Dan Culcer and Daniela CrƒÉsnaru. He also corresponded with Constantin Mateescu, who provided him with references for the history of Mira's native city, R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea. As Mateescu recalls, V√¢lcea was still Baciu's \\"charming land\\". Baciu wrote a complete list of his own works, addressing it to literary critic Nicolae Steinhardt; like his other letters home, it was intercepted by the Securitate.Spiridon & Toader, pp. 162, 165‚Äì166, 168‚Äì173 As remarked by Mateescu, in 1984 the correspondence was abruptly interrupted, \\"even though [Baciu], well informed about our country's realities, was prudent and restrained in his statements\\". Baciu's file shows that the Securitate also made note of this prudence, and was undecided about how to interpret it: > Albeit he misses his country, [Baciu] does not wish to return for a visit, > his refusal backed up by confused explanations, by 'poetic' statements > according to which 'he carries his country inside him'. Although [Baciu] is > adamant about his refusal of our country's current socio-political system, > one may conclude that his literary activity, his propagation of Romanian > literature, art and traditions, is positive in nature. The secret police repeatedly tried but failed to recruit Baciu's Romanian relatives as informants, and resorted to harassing them at their workplaces. With some of his late works of autofiction, Baciu saluted the anticommunist revolt in his native Bra»ôov. He was enthusiastic about the success of Romania's 1989 Revolution. According to his diaspora friend Constantin Eretescu, he hoped to see a rapid transition to a Western-style democracy, but was soon disappointed by the National Salvation Front regime. Interviewed by Marta Petreu for Apostrof, he noted that \\"one has a hard time adjusting after forty-six years in exile\\". His contribution was honored abroad: retired from Hawaii University as a professor emeritus, he was also Bolivia's honorary consul in Honolulu. In 1991, he became Commander of the Bolivian Order of Merit. Baciu died in Honolulu on January 6, 1993, allegedly while talking to his sister Ioana over the phone. His corpus of works, beginning with Poemele poetului t√¢nƒÉr, was being republished in Romania, following efforts by his sister and his brother-in-law, Ovidiu MƒÉrgineanu. Geo »òerban, \\"Steag √Æn bernƒÉ la Casa memorialƒÉ »òtefan Baciu\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 354, January 2007 A new edition of Praful de pe tobƒÉ saw print at Editura Eminescu in 1995. Mira was also republished, by Editura Albatros, in 1998.LazƒÉr, p. 300 In 2006, when his Cetatea lui Bucur was reissued to critical acclaim, Daniel Cristea-Enache, \\"Versuri metropolitane\\", in Cultura, Nr. 79, July 2007 the \\"Yellow House\\" in Bra»ôov was opened for the public as a »òtefan Baciu Memorial House, presently maintained by Bra»ôov City Hall. Poetry Critic Vladimir Streinu saw »òtefan Baciu's early poetry as \\"boastful\\", but lacking \\"a timber of its own\\", and ultimately \\"neutral\\". His first surrealist episode was with Start,Opri»ô, pp. 122‚Äì123 ridiculed at the time by the mainstream review Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ for its \\"jolly good\\" metaphors: \\"It tells us that hounds feed on warm meat and that legs will sing when they walk.\\"\\"Revista revistelor rom√¢ne. Start\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 11/1933, pp. 59‚Äì60 In Poeme de dragoste, Streinu suggests, \\"the tone is youthful\\", but the subject matter is excessively lyrical and self-absorbed. The poet soon moved into a more traditionalist format, with echoes from Ion Pillat and Parnassianism. The result is visualized by critic Daniel Cristea-Enache as a \\"lace of impressionism\\" with a \\"thin but strong\\" expressionistic thread. According to Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ reviewer Cosmin Ciotlo»ô, this is an \\"exact and painstaking\\", but also \\"stunning\\", species of poetry. In Cetatea lui Bucur, Baciu outlined his vision of a decadent-but-fascinating Bucharest, with its many paradoxes: \\"How much I hate thee, my beloved city\\"; \\"Your bitter joy has done me in\\". As noted by Ciotlo»ô, in Baciu's Bucharest \\"everything is alive, everything is artificial\\". The poetic cycle shows Baciu as a social critic, repulsed by the luxurious churches surrounded by slums, but also fascinated with the morbid aspects of Bucharest society, from the \\"grave-blackened women\\" of Bellu cemetery to the pleasure-seekers on Calea Victoriei‚Äîas noted by Cristea-Enache, the latter is merely an anti-capitalist \\"clich√© of that era\\". Political inspiration also fueled some of Baciu's other juvenile works, including poems attacking the Nazis and honoring the August 23 Coup‚Äîwritten with a Social Democratic bias but owing ultimate inspiration to Vladimir Mayakovsky, the Soviet poet laureate. His more conventional humorous poetry, which came out around 1945, owed inspiration to the jocular verse of PƒÉstorel Teodoreanu and George Top√Ærceanu.Popa, p. 91 Returning to the avant-garde with Muzica sferelor, with its homages to unconventional heroes such as Urmuz and George Ciprian, Baciu crafted his own poetic style. In large part, such lyrical work is explicitly self-referential, and inevitably linked to his diaspora experience. His nostalgia for R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea and Bra»ôov slowly replaced his memory of Bucharest. As noted by philologist Andrei Bodiu, he was not Bra»ôov's first poetic chronicler, but the only such poet to be \\"urban and cosmopolitan\\" rather than elegiac and traditionalist.Bodiu, p. 226 Baciu wrote poems dedicated in part to each Latin American country he visited, and made unexpected connections between them and his native country. One such piece, honoring the Cuban dissident movement, reads: Baciu's other poems include a set of pastiches and parody pieces, from Emil Botta, Lucian Blaga, Ion Barbu and Ion Vinea. They stand alongside satirical pieces targeting poets who had made compromises with the political system. In one such work, Baciu scolds Tudor Arghezi: Notes References *»òtefan Baciu, Juan Bosch: un hombre solo, Artes Gr√°ficas Benzal, Madrid, 1967.  \\"Historia de una antolog√≠a del surrealismo\\", in Revista de la Universidad de M√©xico, Vol. 37, January 1983, pp. 8‚Äì11 * Andrei Bodiu, \\"Ora»ôul din memorie\\", in »öara B√¢rsei, Nr. 6/2007, pp. 224‚Äì226 *Lucian Boia, Capcanele istoriei.

He made his league debut in October 1961 against Burnley as a right winger. During the early part of his career, King suffered from a chest illness that nearly forced him out of football before he managed to overcome it during the 1963‚Äì64 season. He scored his only career league hattrick the following season during a 6‚Äì1 defeat of Middlesbrough and became the first player to score for the club in European competition when he found the net during the home leg of a tie against Danish side Esbjerg fB in the European Cup Winners' Cup. He was a vital member of the side for the following few seasons, including finishing as top scorer during the 1967‚Äì68 season with eighteen goals in all competitions as they reached the semi-final of the European Cup Winners' Cup before suffering defeat to Hamburg.

Traders began operating around 1666, after the Great Fire of London, where the market stands today. The Spitalfields regeneration programme that ended in 2005, resulted in two new public spaces ‚Äì Bishops Square and Crispin Place, restoration of several historic streets and more independent retailers and restaurants. Spitalfields Market is situated in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is surrounded by Lamb Street, Old Spitalfields market, Brushfield Street and Bishops Square. thumbnail  History  = Wholesale Market = In 1682, King Charles II officially granted John Balch a Royal Charter allowing him to hold a market every Thursday and Saturday in Spital Square. Over time, the market became one of the main fruit and vegetable markets for London - alongside Covent Garden Market. The reputation of the market encouraged Huguenot silk weavers to settle in the area. They were fleeing France, following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Some of their houses are still standing around Fournier Street, which is now a conservation area. In the mid-1700s, Irish weavers also settled in the area following the decline in the Irish linen industry. The growth in the area led to the establishment of Hawksmoor‚Äôs Christ Church in 1729, which consecrated Spitalfields becoming a parish in its own right. After the 1820s, Spitalfields fell into decline, gaining a reputation as a cheap area in which to live, proving a magnet to numerous waves of immigrants. Jewish refugees filled the area, fleeing from Polish pogroms and Russia, while some were entrepreneurs from the Netherlands. Between the 1880s and 1970s, Spitalfields was one of the largest Jewish communities in England, having more than forty synagogues. By 1876 the market itself had fallen into decline. Recognising the need to improve the market, a former market porter called Robert Horner bought a short lease and built a new market building at a cost of ¬£80,000, which opened in 1893. In 1920, the City of London acquired direct control of the Market, and subsequently extended the site. Due to traffic congestion, lack of space for parking lorries, as well as out of date market buildings (e.g. poor refrigeration facilities) - the wholesale market was relocated out of the City in the early 1990s. This followed the move of Covent Garden Market and Billingsgate Fish Market out of the city centre. The new, purpose built location in Leyton - named New Spitalfields Market) - opened in May 1991. A market remained on the site however - serving the public rather than trade customers. = Regeneration = By the mid-20th century, most of the Jewish community had left the area and since the 1970s, a Bangladeshi community has been flourishing. New cultures, trades and business now fill the area including the renowned Brick Lane restaurant district. There is still some evidence of the various communities from the past that stand today ‚Äì a Huguenot church, Methodist chapel, Jewish synagogue, and Muslim mosque amongst new stores, housing, restaurants and markets. In the mid 2000s, the market site was redeveloped. The new development known as Spitalfields, is located within the areas known as Bishops Square, Market Street & Crispin Place, which includes the Spitalfields Traders Market in Crispin Place. Directly adjacent with a seamless boundary and shared covered roof, is Old Spitalfields Market, situated in the Horner Buildings. Spitalfields Market currently is opened every day of the week. It hosts various retail brands, street-food stalls, bars and restaurants, and independent traders showcasing handcrafted goods, artwork, fashion, and jewellery. It also hosts public art and events programmes.

Kokotovic and others for designing stabilizing controls for a special class of nonlinear dynamical systems. These systems are built from subsystems that radiate out from an irreducible subsystem that can be stabilized using some other method. Because of this recursive structure, the designer can start the design process at the known-stable system and \\"back out\\" new controllers that progressively stabilize each outer subsystem. The process terminates when the final external control is reached. Hence, this process is known as backstepping. Backstepping approach The backstepping approach provides a recursive method for stabilizing the origin of a system in strict-feedback form. That is, consider a system of the form :\\\\begin{align}\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} &= f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 &= f_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) + g_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) z_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 &= f_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) + g_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) z_3\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_i &= f_i(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \\\\ldots, z_{i-1}, z_i) + g_i(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \\\\ldots, z_{i-1}, z_i) z_{i+1} \\\\quad \\\\text{ for } 1 \\\\leq i < k-1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_{k-1} &= f_{k-1}(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \\\\ldots, z_{k-1}) + g_{k-1}(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \\\\ldots, z_{k-1}) z_k\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_k &= f_k(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \\\\ldots, z_{k-1}, z_k) + g_k(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \\\\dots, z_{k-1}, z_k) u \\\\end{cases}\\\\end{align} where * \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n with n \\\\geq 1, * z_1, z_2, \\\\ldots, z_i, \\\\ldots, z_{k-1}, z_k are scalars, * is a scalar input to the system, * f_x, f_1, f_2, \\\\ldots, f_i, \\\\ldots, f_{k-1}, f_k vanish at the origin (i.e., f_i(0,0,\\\\dots,0) = 0), * g_1, g_2, \\\\ldots, g_i, \\\\ldots, g_{k-1}, g_k are nonzero over the domain of interest (i.e., g_i(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,\\\\ldots,z_k) eq 0 for 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq k). Also assume that the subsystem :\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) is stabilized to the origin (i.e., \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{0}\\\\,) by some known control u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) such that u_x(\\\\mathbf{0}) = 0. It is also assumed that a Lyapunov function V_x for this stable subsystem is known. That is, this subsystem is stabilized by some other method and backstepping extends its stability to the \\\\textbf{z} shell around it. In systems of this strict-feedback form around a stable subsystem, * The backstepping-designed control input has its most immediate stabilizing impact on state z_n. * The state z_n then acts like a stabilizing control on the state z_{n-1} before it. * This process continues so that each state z_i is stabilized by the fictitious \\"control\\" z_{i+1}. The backstepping approach determines how to stabilize the subsystem using z_1, and then proceeds with determining how to make the next state z_2 drive z_1 to the control required to stabilize . Hence, the process \\"steps backward\\" from out of the strict-feedback form system until the ultimate control is designed. Recursive Control Design Overview # It is given that the smaller (i.e., lower-order) subsystem #::\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) #:is already stabilized to the origin by some control u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) where u_x(\\\\mathbf{0}) = 0. That is, choice of u_x to stabilize this system must occur using some other method. It is also assumed that a Lyapunov function V_x for this stable subsystem is known. Backstepping provides a way to extend the controlled stability of this subsystem to the larger system. # A control u_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) is designed so that the system #::\\\\dot{z}_1 = f_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) + g_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) u_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) #:is stabilized so that z_1 follows the desired u_x control. The control design is based on the augmented Lyapunov function candidate #::V_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) = V_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\frac{1}{2}( z_1 - u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) )^2 #:The control u_1 can be picked to bound \\\\dot{V}_1 away from zero. # A control u_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) is designed so that the system #::\\\\dot{z}_2 = f_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) + g_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) u_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) #:is stabilized so that z_2 follows the desired u_1 control. The control design is based on the augmented Lyapunov function candidate #::V_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) = V_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) + \\\\frac{1}{2}( z_2 - u_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) )^2 #:The control u_2 can be picked to bound \\\\dot{V}_2 away from zero. # This process continues until the actual is known, and #* The real control stabilizes z_k to fictitious control u_{k-1}. #* The fictitious control u_{k-1} stabilizes z_{k-1} to fictitious control u_{k-2}. #* The fictitious control u_{k-2} stabilizes z_{k-2} to fictitious control u_{k-3}. #* ... #* The fictitious control u_2 stabilizes z_2 to fictitious control u_1. #* The fictitious control u_1 stabilizes z_1 to fictitious control u_x. #* The fictitious control u_x stabilizes to the origin. This process is known as backstepping because it starts with the requirements on some internal subsystem for stability and progressively steps back out of the system, maintaining stability at each step. Because * f_i vanish at the origin for 0 \\\\leq i \\\\leq k, * g_i are nonzero for 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq k, * the given control u_x has u_x(\\\\mathbf{0}) = 0, then the resulting system has an equilibrium at the origin (i.e., where \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\mathbf{0}\\\\,, z_1=0, z_2=0, ..., z_{k-1}=0, and z_k=0) that is globally asymptotically stable. Integrator Backstepping Before describing the backstepping procedure for general strict-feedback form dynamical systems, it is convenient to discuss the approach for a smaller class of strict-feedback form systems. These systems connect a series of integrators to the input of a system with a known feedback-stabilizing control law, and so the stabilizing approach is known as integrator backstepping. With a small modification, the integrator backstepping approach can be extended to handle all strict-feedback form systems. =Single-integrator Equilibrium= Consider the dynamical system = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = u_1 \\\\end{cases}  }} where \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n and z_1 is a scalar. This system is a cascade connection of an integrator with the subsystem (i.e., the input enters an integrator, and the integral z_1 enters the subsystem). We assume that f_x(\\\\mathbf{0})=0, and so if u_1=0, \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{0}\\\\, and z_1 = 0, then :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\underbrace{\\\\mathbf{0}}_{\\\\mathbf{x}}) + ( g_x(\\\\underbrace{\\\\mathbf{0}}_{\\\\mathbf{x}}) )(\\\\underbrace{0}_{z_1}) = 0 + ( g_x(\\\\mathbf{0}) )(0) = \\\\mathbf{0} & \\\\quad \\\\text{ (i.e., } \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\text{ is stationary)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = \\\\overbrace{0}^{u_1} & \\\\quad \\\\text{ (i.e., } z_1 = 0 \\\\text{ is stationary)} \\\\end{cases} So the origin (\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) = (\\\\mathbf{0},0) is an equilibrium (i.e., a stationary point) of the system. If the system ever reaches the origin, it will remain there forever after. =Single-integrator Backstepping= In this example, backstepping is used to stabilize the single-integrator system in Equation () around its equilibrium at the origin. To be less precise, we wish to design a control law u_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) that ensures that the states (\\\\mathbf{x}, z_1) return to (\\\\mathbf{0},0) after the system is started from some arbitrary initial condition. * First, by assumption, the subsystem ::\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = F(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\qquad \\\\text{where} \\\\qquad F(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\triangleq f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) :with u_x(\\\\mathbf{0}) = 0 has a Lyapunov function V_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) > 0 such that ::\\\\dot{V}_x=\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}(f_x(\\\\mathbf{x})+g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})u_x(\\\\mathbf{x})) \\\\leq - W(\\\\mathbf{x}) :where W(\\\\mathbf{x}) is a positive-definite function. That is, we assume that we have already shown that this existing simpler subsystem is stable (in the sense of Lyapunov). Roughly speaking, this notion of stability means that:  The function V_x is like a \\"generalized energy\\" of the subsystem. As the states of the system move away from the origin, the energy V_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) also grows.  By showing that over time, the energy V_x(\\\\mathbf{x}(t)) decays to zero, then the states must decay toward \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\mathbf{0}\\\\,. That is, the origin \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\mathbf{0}\\\\, will be a stable equilibrium of the system ‚Äì the states will continuously approach the origin as time increases.  Saying that W(\\\\mathbf{x}) is positive definite means that W(\\\\mathbf{x}) > 0 everywhere except for \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\mathbf{0}\\\\,, and W(\\\\mathbf{0})=0.  The statement that \\\\dot{V}_x \\\\leq -W(\\\\mathbf{x}) means that \\\\dot{V}_x is bounded away from zero for all points except where \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{0}\\\\,. That is, so long as the system is not at its equilibrium at the origin, its \\"energy\\" will be decreasing.  Because the energy is always decaying, then the system must be stable; its trajectories must approach the origin. :Our task is to find a control that makes our cascaded (\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) system also stable. So we must find a new Lyapunov function candidate for this new system. That candidate will depend upon the control , and by choosing the control properly, we can ensure that it is decaying everywhere as well. * Next, by adding and subtracting g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) (i.e., we don't change the system in any way because we make no net effect) to the \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} part of the larger (\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) system, it becomes ::\\\\begin{cases}\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1 + \\\\mathord{\\\\underbrace{\\\\left( g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) - g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\right)}_{0}}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\dot{z}_1 = u_1\\\\end{cases} :which we can re-group to get ::\\\\begin{cases}\\\\dot{x} = \\\\mathord{\\\\underbrace{\\\\left( f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\right)}_{F(\\\\mathbf{x})}} + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\underbrace{\\\\left( z_1 - u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\right)}_{z_1 \\\\text{ error tracking } u_x}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\dot{z}_1 = u_1\\\\end{cases} :So our cascaded supersystem encapsulates the known-stable \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = F(\\\\mathbf{x}) subsystem plus some error perturbation generated by the integrator. * We now can change variables from (\\\\mathbf{x}, z_1) to (\\\\mathbf{x}, e_1) by letting e_1 \\\\triangleq z_1 - u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}). So ::\\\\begin{cases}\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = (f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) u_x(\\\\mathbf{x})) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) e_1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\dot{e}_1 = u_1 - \\\\dot{u}_x\\\\end{cases} : Additionally, we let v_1 \\\\triangleq u_1 - \\\\dot{u}_x so that u_1 = v_1 + \\\\dot{u}_x and ::\\\\begin{cases}\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = (f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}))+g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) e_1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\dot{e}_1 = v_1\\\\end{cases} : We seek to stabilize this error system by feedback through the new control v_1. By stabilizing the system at e_1 = 0, the state z_1 will track the desired control u_x which will result in stabilizing the inner subsystem. * From our existing Lyapunov function V_x, we define the augmented Lyapunov function candidate ::V_1(\\\\mathbf{x}, e_1) \\\\triangleq V_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\frac{1}{2} e_1^2 : So ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{V}_1 &= \\\\dot{V}_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left( 2 e_1 \\\\dot{e}_1 \\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\dot{V}_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + e_1 \\\\dot{e}_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\dot{V}_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + e_1 \\\\overbrace{v_1}^{\\\\dot{e}_1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\overbrace{\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}} \\\\underbrace{\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}}_{\\\\text{(i.e., }\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\mathbf{x}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\text{)}}}^{\\\\dot{V}_x\\\\text{ (i.e.,} \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}V_x}{\\\\operatorname{d}t}\\\\text{)}} + e_1 v_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\overbrace{\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}} \\\\underbrace{\\\\left( (f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})u_x(\\\\mathbf{x})) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) e_1 \\\\right)}_{\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}}}^{\\\\dot{V}_x} + e_1 v_1 \\\\end{align} : By distributing \\\\partial V_x/\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}, we see that ::\\\\dot{V}_1 = \\\\overbrace{\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}(f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}))}^{{} \\\\leq -W(\\\\mathbf{x})} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) e_1 + e_1 v_1 \\\\leq -W(\\\\mathbf{x})+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}} g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) e_1 + e_1 v_1 : To ensure that \\\\dot{V}_1 \\\\leq -W(\\\\mathbf{x}) < 0 (i.e., to ensure stability of the supersystem), we pick the control law ::v_1 = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})- k_1 e_1 : with k_1 > 0, and so ::\\\\dot{V}_1 = -W(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}} g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) e_1 + e_1\\\\overbrace{\\\\left( -\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})-k_1 e_1 \\\\right)}^{v_1} : After distributing the e_1 through, ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{V}_1 & = -W(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\mathord{\\\\overbrace{\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}} g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) e_1 \\\\- e_1 \\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})}^{0}} - k_1 e_1^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= -W(\\\\mathbf{x})-k_1 e_1^2 \\\\leq -W(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\\\\\\\\\ &< 0 \\\\end{align} : So our candidate Lyapunov function V_1 is a true Lyapunov function, and our system is stable under this control law v_1 (which corresponds the control law u_1 because v_1 \\\\triangleq u_1 - \\\\dot{u}_x). Using the variables from the original coordinate system, the equivalent Lyapunov function : : As discussed below, this Lyapunov function will be used again when this procedure is applied iteratively to multiple-integrator problem. * Our choice of control v_1 ultimately depends on all of our original state variables. In particular, the actual feedback-stabilizing control law : g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})-k_1(\\\\underbrace{z_1-u_x(\\\\mathbf{x})}_{e_1})}^{v_1} \\\\, + \\\\, \\\\overbrace{\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}(\\\\underbrace{f_x(\\\\mathbf{x})+g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})z_1}_{\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} \\\\text{ (i.e., } \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\mathbf{x}}{\\\\operatorname{d}t} \\\\text{)}})}^{\\\\dot{u}_x \\\\text{ (i.e., } \\\\frac{ \\\\operatorname{d}u_x }{\\\\operatorname{d}t} \\\\text{)}}  }} : The states and z_1 and functions f_x and g_x come from the system. The function u_x comes from our known-stable \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}=F(\\\\mathbf{x}) subsystem. The gain parameter k_1 > 0 affects the convergence rate or our system. Under this control law, our system is stable at the origin (\\\\mathbf{x},z_1)=(\\\\mathbf{0},0). : Recall that u_1 in Equation () drives the input of an integrator that is connected to a subsystem that is feedback-stabilized by the control law u_x. Not surprisingly, the control u_1 has a \\\\dot{u}_x term that will be integrated to follow the stabilizing control law \\\\dot{u}_x plus some offset. The other terms provide damping to remove that offset and any other perturbation effects that would be magnified by the integrator. So because this system is feedback stabilized by u_1(\\\\mathbf{x}, z_1) and has Lyapunov function V_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) with \\\\dot{V}_1(\\\\mathbf{x}, z_1) \\\\leq -W(\\\\mathbf{x}) < 0, it can be used as the upper subsystem in another single-integrator cascade system. =Motivating Example: Two-integrator Backstepping= Before discussing the recursive procedure for the general multiple-integrator case, it is instructive to study the recursion present in the two-integrator case. That is, consider the dynamical system = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = z_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 = u_2 \\\\end{cases}  }} where \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n and z_1 and z_2 are scalars. This system is a cascade connection of the single-integrator system in Equation () with another integrator (i.e., the input u_2 enters through an integrator, and the output of that integrator enters the system in Equation () by its u_1 input). By letting * \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\triangleq \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_1 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\,, * f_y(\\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\triangleq \\\\begin{bmatrix} f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\,, * g_y(\\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\triangleq \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{0}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\, then the two-integrator system in Equation () becomes the single-integrator system = f_y(\\\\mathbf{y}) + g_y(\\\\mathbf{y}) z_2 &\\\\quad \\\\text{( where this } \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\text{ subsystem is stabilized by } z_2 = u_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) \\\\text{ )}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 = u_2. \\\\end{cases}  }} By the single-integrator procedure, the control law u_y(\\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\triangleq u_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) stabilizes the upper z_2-to- subsystem using the Lyapunov function V_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1), and so Equation () is a new single-integrator system that is structurally equivalent to the single-integrator system in Equation (). So a stabilizing control u_2 can be found using the same single- integrator procedure that was used to find u_1. =Many-integrator backstepping= In the two-integrator case, the upper single-integrator subsystem was stabilized yielding a new single-integrator system that can be similarly stabilized. This recursive procedure can be extended to handle any finite number of integrators. This claim can be formally proved with mathematical induction. Here, a stabilized multiple-integrator system is built up from subsystems of already-stabilized multiple-integrator subsystems. * First, consider the dynamical system ::\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) u_x :that has scalar input u_x and output states \\\\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n]^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Assume that f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\mathbf{0} so that the zero-input (i.e., u_x = 0) system is stationary at the origin \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{0}\\\\,. In this case, the origin is called an equilibrium of the system. The feedback control law u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) stabilizes the system at the equilibrium at the origin. A Lyapunov function corresponding to this system is described by V_x(\\\\mathbf{x}). :That is, if output states are fed back to the input u_x by the control law u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}), then the output states (and the Lyapunov function) return to the origin after a single perturbation (e.g., after a nonzero initial condition or a sharp disturbance). This subsystem is stabilized by feedback control law u_x. * Next, connect an integrator to input u_x so that the augmented system has input u_1 (to the integrator) and output states . The resulting augmented dynamical system is ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = u_1 \\\\end{cases} :This \\"cascade\\" system matches the form in Equation (), and so the single-integrator backstepping procedure leads to the stabilizing control law in Equation (). That is, if we feed back states z_1 and to input u_1 according to the control law ::u_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1)=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})-k_1(z_1-u_x(\\\\mathbf{x})) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}(f_x(\\\\mathbf{x})+g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})z_1) : with gain k_1 > 0, then the states z_1 and will return to z_1 = 0 and \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\mathbf{0}\\\\, after a single perturbation. This subsystem is stabilized by feedback control law u_1, and the corresponding Lyapunov function from Equation () is ::V_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) = V_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\frac{1}{2}( z_1 - u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) )^2 :That is, under feedback control law u_1, the Lyapunov function V_1 decays to zero as the states return to the origin. * Connect a new integrator to input u_1 so that the augmented system has input u_2 and output states . The resulting augmented dynamical system is ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = z_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 = u_2 \\\\end{cases} :which is equivalent to the single-integrator system ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 \\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\triangleq \\\\, \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}_1} = \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\triangleq \\\\, f_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1)} \\\\+ \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{0}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\triangleq \\\\, g_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1)} z_2 &\\\\qquad \\\\text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_1, \\\\text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_1(\\\\textbf{x}_1) \\\\text{ )}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 = u_2 \\\\end{cases} :Using these definitions of \\\\mathbf{x}_1, f_1, and g_1, this system can also be expressed as ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}_1 = f_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1) + g_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1) z_2 &\\\\qquad \\\\text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_1, \\\\text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_1(\\\\textbf{x}_1) \\\\text{ )}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 = u_2 \\\\end{cases} :This system matches the single-integrator structure of Equation (), and so the single-integrator backstepping procedure can be applied again. That is, if we feed back states z_1, z_2, and to input u_2 according to the control law ::u_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2)=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_1}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_1 } g_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1)-k_2(z_2-u_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1)) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_1}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_1}(f_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1)+g_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1)z_2) :with gain k_2 > 0, then the states z_1, z_2, and will return to z_1 = 0, z_2 = 0, and \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\mathbf{0}\\\\, after a single perturbation. This subsystem is stabilized by feedback control law u_2, and the corresponding Lyapunov function is ::V_2(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) = V_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1) + \\\\frac{1}{2}( z_2 - u_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1) )^2 :That is, under feedback control law u_2, the Lyapunov function V_2 decays to zero as the states return to the origin. * Connect an integrator to input u_2 so that the augmented system has input u_3 and output states . The resulting augmented dynamical system is ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = z_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 = z_3\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_3 = u_3 \\\\end{cases} :which can be re-grouped as the single-integrator system ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\triangleq \\\\, \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}_2} = \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\triangleq \\\\, f_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2)} \\\\+ \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{0}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\triangleq \\\\, g_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2)} z_3 &\\\\qquad \\\\text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_2, \\\\text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_2(\\\\textbf{x}_2) \\\\text{ )}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_3 = u_3 \\\\end{cases} :By the definitions of \\\\mathbf{x}_1, f_1, and g_1 from the previous step, this system is also represented by ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}_2} = \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} f_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1) + g_1(\\\\mathbf{x}_1) z_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{bmatrix} }^{f_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2)} \\\\+ \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{0}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{bmatrix} }^{g_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2)} z_3 &\\\\qquad \\\\text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_2, \\\\text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_2(\\\\textbf{x}_2) \\\\text{ )}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_3 = u_3 \\\\end{cases} :Further, using these definitions of \\\\mathbf{x}_2, f_2, and g_2, this system can also be expressed as ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}_2 = f_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2) + g_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2) z_3 &\\\\qquad \\\\text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_2, \\\\text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_2(\\\\textbf{x}_2) \\\\text{ )}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_3 = u_3 \\\\end{cases} :So the re-grouped system has the single-integrator structure of Equation (), and so the single- integrator backstepping procedure can be applied again. That is, if we feed back states z_1, z_2, z_3, and to input u_3 according to the control law ::u_3(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2,z_3)=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_2}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_2 } g_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2)-k_3(z_3-u_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2)) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_2}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_2}(f_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2)+g_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2)z_3) :with gain k_3 > 0, then the states z_1, z_2, z_3, and will return to z_1 = 0, z_2 = 0, z_3 = 0, and \\\\mathbf{x}=\\\\mathbf{0}\\\\, after a single perturbation. This subsystem is stabilized by feedback control law u_3, and the corresponding Lyapunov function is ::V_3(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2,z_3) = V_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2) + \\\\frac{1}{2}( z_3 - u_2(\\\\mathbf{x}_2) )^2 :That is, under feedback control law u_3, the Lyapunov function V_3 decays to zero as the states return to the origin. * This process can continue for each integrator added to the system, and hence any system of the form ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1 &\\\\qquad \\\\text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_x, \\\\text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_x(\\\\textbf{x}) \\\\text{ )}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = z_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 = z_3\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_i = z_{i+1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_{k-2} = z_{k-1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_{k-1} = z_k\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_k = u \\\\end{cases} :has the recursive structure ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1 &\\\\qquad \\\\text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_x, \\\\text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_x(\\\\textbf{x}) \\\\text{ )}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = z_2 \\\\end{cases}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 = z_3 \\\\end{cases}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\end{cases}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_i = z_{i+1} \\\\end{cases}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\end{cases}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_{k-2} = z_{k-1} \\\\end{cases}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_{k-1} = z_k \\\\end{cases}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_k = u \\\\end{cases} :and can be feedback stabilized by finding the feedback- stabilizing control and Lyapunov function for the single-integrator (\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) subsystem (i.e., with input z_2 and output ) and iterating out from that inner subsystem until the ultimate feedback-stabilizing control is known. At iteration , the equivalent system is ::\\\\begin{cases} \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_{i-2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_{i-1} \\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\triangleq \\\\, \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}_{i-1}} = \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} f_{i-2}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i-2}) + g_{i-2}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) z_{i-2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\triangleq \\\\, f_{i-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1})} \\\\+ \\\\overbrace{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{0}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\\\end{bmatrix} }^{\\\\triangleq \\\\, g_{i-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1})} z_i &\\\\quad \\\\text{ ( by Lyap. func. } V_{i-1}, \\\\text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_{i-1}(\\\\textbf{x}_{i-1}) \\\\text{ )}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_i = u_i \\\\end{cases} :The corresponding feedback-stabilizing control law is ::u_i(\\\\overbrace{\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2,\\\\dots,z_i}^{\\\\triangleq \\\\, \\\\mathbf{x}_i})=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_{i-1}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1} } g_{i-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) \\\\, - \\\\, k_i(z_i \\\\, - \\\\, u_{i-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1})) \\\\, + \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_{i-1}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1}}(f_{i-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) \\\\, + \\\\, g_{i-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1})z_i) :with gain k_i > 0. The corresponding Lyapunov function is ::V_i(\\\\mathbf{x}_i) = V_{i-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) + \\\\frac{1}{2}( z_i - u_{i-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) )^2 :By this construction, the ultimate control u(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2,\\\\ldots,z_k) = u_k(\\\\mathbf{x}_k) (i.e., ultimate control is found at final iteration i=k). Hence, any system in this special many- integrator strict-feedback form can be feedback stabilized using a straightforward procedure that can even be automated (e.g., as part of an adaptive control algorithm). Generic Backstepping Systems in the special strict-feedback form have a recursive structure similar to the many-integrator system structure. Likewise, they are stabilized by stabilizing the smallest cascaded system and then backstepping to the next cascaded system and repeating the procedure. So it is critical to develop a single-step procedure; that procedure can be recursively applied to cover the many-step case. Fortunately, due to the requirements on the functions in the strict-feedback form, each single-step system can be rendered by feedback to a single- integrator system, and that single-integrator system can be stabilized using methods discussed above. =Single-step Procedure= Consider the simple strict-feedback system = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = f_1(\\\\mathbf{x}, z_1) + g_1(\\\\mathbf{x}, z_1) u_1 \\\\end{cases}  }} where * \\\\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n]^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, * z_1 and u_1 are scalars, * For all and z_1, g_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) eq 0. Rather than designing feedback-stabilizing control u_1 directly, introduce a new control u_{a1} (to be designed later) and use control law :u_1( \\\\mathbf{x}, z_1 ) = \\\\frac{ 1 }{ g_1( \\\\mathbf{x}, z_1 ) } \\\\left( u_{a1} - f_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) \\\\right) which is possible because g_1 eq 0. So the system in Equation () is :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = f_1(\\\\mathbf{x}, z_1) + g_1(\\\\mathbf{x}, z_1) \\\\overbrace{\\\\frac{ 1 }{ g_1( \\\\mathbf{x}, z_1 ) } \\\\left( u_{a1} - f_1(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1) \\\\right)}^{u_1(\\\\mathbf{x}, z_1)} \\\\end{cases} which simplifies to :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) z_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{z}_1 = u_{a1} \\\\end{cases} This new u_{a1}-to- system matches the single-integrator cascade system in Equation (). Assuming that a feedback-stabilizing control law u_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) and Lyapunov function V_x(\\\\mathbf{x}) for the upper subsystem is known, the feedback-stabilizing control law from Equation () is :u_{a1}(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1)=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial V_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})-k_1(z_1-u_x(\\\\mathbf{x})) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}(f_x(\\\\mathbf{x})+g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})z_1) with gain k_1 > 0. So the final feedback-stabilizing control law is g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})-k_1(z_1-u_x(\\\\mathbf{x})) + \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_x}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}}(f_x(\\\\mathbf{x})+g_x(\\\\mathbf{x})z_1)}^{u_{a1}(\\\\mathbf{x},z_1)} \\\\, - \\\\, f_1(\\\\mathbf{x}, z_1) \\\\right) }} with gain k_1 > 0. The corresponding Lyapunov function from Equation () is Because this strict-feedback system has a feedback-stabilizing control and a corresponding Lyapunov function, it can be cascaded as part of a larger strict-feedback system, and this procedure can be repeated to find the surrounding feedback-stabilizing control. =Many-step Procedure= As in many-integrator backstepping, the single-step procedure can be completed iteratively to stabilize an entire strict-feedback system. In each step, # The smallest \\"unstabilized\\" single-step strict-feedback system is isolated. # Feedback is used to convert the system into a single-integrator system. # The resulting single-integrator system is stabilized. # The stabilized system is used as the upper system in the next step.

It was completed in 1960 and has 28 floors. It is the 21st-tallest building in the city. It is the first major post-World War II skyscraper built in Minneapolis. It is also the city's tallest building completed in the 1960s. A skyway connects the building to the Rand Tower, Soo Line Building, and US Bank Plaza. The building's history began in 1955 when First Bank System of Minneapolis hired Holabird, Root & Burgee of Chicago to design a new headquarters. The project, assisted by Minneapolis firm Thorshov & Cerny, drew inspiration from the design principles of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and the recently completed Lever House in New York City. Construction commenced with demolition of the New York Life Insurance Building in 1957, followed by a January groundbreaking in 1958, and final occupancy in May of 1960. The building served as the headquarters for First Bank System (now U.S. Bancorp) until its move to the Capella Tower in 1992. It subsequently took on the name One Financial Plaza. In August 2012, the building gained its current moniker when Canadian Pacific Railway moved its United States headquarters and 400 employees out of the nearby Soo Line Building, which was undergoing conversion into a residential building. The Soo Line Building is the namesake of the historic Soo Line Railroad, of which the Canadian Pacific become majority shareholder in 1890 and took full control in 1990, moving its own US headquarters into the former Soo Line offices.Janet Moore, Soo Line's conversion to apartments is close to reality , Star Tribune, April 12, 2012, accessed August 6, 2013.

The show featured four women visiting alleged haunted locations in the province of Ontario. To visit these locations, they used a motorhome with the Girly Ghosthunters logo on the sides, driven by a character named Schultzy. They used modern ghost hunting equipment, in an attempt to document any ghosts, apparitions or other phenomena in the visited locations. Before doing so, they interviewed a few people at each locale to understand the history of the building and hear how the place was haunted.

Its first major use was for testing stages of the Centaur Rocket, which was used to launch some of America's most important space probes.National Historic Landmark listing The facility was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985. Description and history NASA's Plum Brook Station is located off Taylor Road, between Bloomingville and Bogart, south of Sandusky, Ohio. This remote site was established by NASA to facilitate large-scale testing of dangerous equipment. The In-Space Propulsion Facility, designed to perform full-scale test-firing of large rockets, is one of several facilities at the station. It consists of a building housing its main test chamber, a test equipment building, and fueling and exhaust facilities associated with the firing of rockets within the test chamber. The main chamber is a steel cylinder designed to house test subjects up to in diameter and in height. A door high provides access for bringing equipment into the chamber, which is equipped with several viewports through which remote viewing apparatus can observe the test. The chamber has a cooling wall capable of being maintained at , cooled by liquid nitrogen. Infrared lamps simulate radiation environments found in space, and the chamber is capable of being having its pressure reduced to the equivalent of of altitude. Engines in the test chamber can generate a thrust up to 400,000 pounds. The facility was built in 1968 as part of the Centaur development. These upper-stage rockets (launched on Atlas V first stages) needed to be capable of firing at high altitude to launch their payloads out of Earth orbit. More than ten tests of Centaur rockets here enabled the later successful launches in the Pioneer, Voyager, and Viking programs.

History The BA was conceived as a standard-gauge cross-country route linking lines of the Chemin de Fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans (PO). Although the original scheme was abandoned, the PO built the line as a single-track metre-gauge railway, linking Argent with Le Blanc, and running through the departments of Loiret, Loir-et-Cher and Indre. The line had a total length of , with headquarters at Romorantin. It opened in 1901 and remained intact until 1951, when the first closures took place. All traffic was steam hauled until the early 1930s, when Billard railcars were introduced to handle some of the passenger traffic. Steam locomotives were operated until the 1950s. In 1981, the Centre region and SNCF agreed to rebuild the four Verney railcars, and built two new ones. The timetable was reorganised to give better connections with the SNCF. The BA became part of TER in 1987. Freight traffic on the BA ended in 1989. The lines The BA was divided into five sections operationally. =Argent - Salbris= Closed to passengers in 1939.

Background The 45rpm single of \\"A Night with Daddy 'G'\\" identifies the composers by their last names only ‚Äì Barge, Guida, Royster ‚Äì and identifies the music publisher as Pepe Music (BMI). The Legrand Records 45 release of the vocal \\"Quarter to Three\\" version adds \\"Anderson\\" to the author credits, since that was Bonds' birthname and he supplied the vocal arrangement. The single was recorded with very rough sound quality (compared to other records at the time). Producer Frank Guida has been quoted on subsequent CD reissues that his production sound was exactly what he wanted it to sound like. Noted British producer and columnist Jack Good felt compelled to devote his entire Disc magazine column to praising the \\"fuzzy, muzzy, and distorted\\" sound of the U.S. Bonds hit release. The article was subtitled \\"This record could never have been made in Britain\\". There have been books written, such as those of the series Rock On: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock N' Roll by Norm N. Nite, that have stated that this record was recorded \\"accidentally\\" (that no one knew the tape recorder was on at a session). Members of the Church Street Five (otherwise known as Gene Barge's band) played on this and all of the other Legrand and S.P.Q.R releases, including Jimmy Soul's sides. Members of this group included Ron \\"Junior\\" Farley on bass, Willie Burnell on piano, Leonard Barks on trombone, and Emmet Shields on drums. Eric Shauls and Wayne Beckner also played guitar on this record and various other records produced by Frank Guida (Earl Swanson played the sax solo on this side as well). the song begins in E-Flat Minor, with a spoken dialogue by Gary US Bonds and the other backup fingers, before going into the refrain in D Major. Chart performance The song became a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States on June 26, 1961, and remained there for two weeks. On the Hot R&B; Sides chart it went to number 3. The UK release on Top Rank International JAR 575 reached number 7 in the UK chart on September 2, 1961. In this release and the original release in the United States, the record's B-side is \\"Time Ole Story\\" (Beckner).

Praised for his late approach to poetry and prose, which transgresses the genres and introduces an aestheticized, original and progressively dark perspective to Romanian literature, he was also criticized for his early commitment to Socialist Realism and communism. Much of his work belongs to the field of travel literature, recording his experiences in the Eastern Bloc, the Far East and Soviet Union, and finally Central Europe. He was also a critically acclaimed translator of foreign works, including the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata and poems by Jorge Sempr√∫n, Artur Lundkvist and others, the author of world literature anthologies, and the editor of monographs on Romanian and foreign painters. After a brief affiliation to Surrealism in the 1940s, Baconsky was a prominent supporter of the communist regime who joined its cultural establishment. In the mid-1950s, he grew disillusioned with communist guidelines‚Äîthis attitude was notably manifested in his activity as editor of the Cluj-based magazine Steaua (where he reacted against the prevailing censorship), his 1972 public reaction against the norms imposed by the Nicolae Ceau≈üescu regime, and his samizdat novel Biserica neagrƒÉ (\\"The Black Church\\"). Having spent much of final years in Austria and West Berlin, where he became a critic of consumerism, Baconsky died in Bucharest, a victim of the 1977 earthquake. Anatol E. Baconsky was the elder brother of Leon Baconsky, a literary historian and academic, and the father of writer and diplomat Teodor Baconschi. Biography =Early life= Born in Cofa village, northern Bessarabia (presently Konovka, Ukraine), he was the eldest son of Eftimie Baconsky, a Romanian Orthodox priest,Braga, p.XXX whose name he used as his patronymic middle name (usually marked by the initial).C√¢mpan, p.101 His brother Leon was born in 1928, around the time when the Baconsky family was spending long intervals in DrepcƒÉu≈£i, a locality on the Prut River shore. In 1936‚Äì1944, he was in Chi≈üinƒÉu, where he attended the Alecu Russo Gymnasium and High School, publishing his first poems in the school magazine Mugurel during 1942.Braga, p.VII‚ÄìVIII, XXX During those years, Romania was engaged on the Axis side in the war against the Soviet Union, and Bessarabia soon became part of the Eastern Front, before the King Michael Coup and the start of Soviet occupation brought Nazi German influence to an end (see Romania during World War II). The Baconskys left the region, and Anatol attended the Lahovary High School in R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea (1944‚Äì1945). Eventually, the family settled in CiomƒÉge≈üti, Arge»ô County, while Anatol took his baccalaureate (June 1945) and briefly worked at a factory in the Transylvanian town of CisnƒÉdie.Braga, p.XXX‚ÄìXXXI In November 1945, Baconsky moved to Cluj. He began his studies at the Cluj University Faculty of Law, while attending lectures in Philosophy and Aesthetics given by Lucian Blaga and Eugeniu Sperantia.Braga, p.XXXI His first essay, which Baconsky considered his actual debut work, was published by the Tribuna NouƒÉ newspaper. Beginning 1946, his work was given more exposure, and was published in local Transylvanian journals (such as the Carei-based Prietenii Artei) before being featured in the collective volume Antologia primƒÉverii (\\"The Anthology of Spring\\"). He was at the time an adherent to Surrealism, and a volume of his Surrealist poetry was supposed to be edited by Editura Funda≈£iilor Regale, but never saw print, owing to the institution's disestablishment by the new communist authorities.Braga, p.VIII, XXXI Literary historian Mircea Braga writes that, over the following years, Baconsky showed himself to be a staunch critic of Surrealism, and quotes him defining Andr√© Breton's pupils as followers of a \\"rigid dogma\\".Braga, p.VIII Literary critic and academic Diana C√¢mpan also that the split with Surrealism and the avant- garde was a sign of his belief that negation could only result in value if substantiated, as well as his theory that aesthetic revolt, after manifesting itself as a disease, was degenerating into kitsch.C√¢mpan, passim Discarding Surrealism soon after, Baconsky moved to a poetic version of Socialist Realism, partly influenced by the Soviet Proletkult tradition (see Socialist realism in Romania).Cornel Ungureanu, postface to Babe≈£i & Ungureanu, p.518 In 1949, the year of his graduation, Baconsky was a regional delegate to the Writers' Congress in Bucharest, a conference which led to the creation of the Romanian Writers' Union (USR). Also in 1949, he joined the writing staff of the Lupta Ardealului journal, and married Clara Popa, a student at the Cluj University Faculty of Letters. In October, his poetry was published in a bilingual almanac co-edited by Romanian and Hungarian writers (it was titled √émpreunƒÉ in Romanian and Egy√ºtt in Hungarian, both words meaning \\"Together\\"). =Early years at Steaua= In 1950, Baconsky completed his first volume, Poezii (\\"Poems\\", published by the USR's Editura de stat pentru literaturƒÉ ≈üi artƒÉ). The following year, he printed another book of poetry, Copiii din Valea Arie≈üului (\\"The Children of the Arie≈ü Valley\\").Braga, p.XXXII The new editor was by then involved in a number of disputes with other young authors, in particular those grouped around the Sibiu Literary Circle, among them ≈ûtefan Augustin Doina≈ü and Nicolae BalotƒÉ. Paul Cernat, \\"Despre A.E. Baconsky, cu dus-√Æntors\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 352-353, December 2006 George Neagoe, \\"PƒÉcatele tinere≈£ii. ≈ûtefan Aug. Doina≈ü a.k.a. Ion MotoarcƒÉ\\", in Cultura, Nr. 66/2010 It was at that stage that he began collaborating with Almanahul Literar, a newly founded magazine edited by communist poet Miron Radu Paraschivescu, which, in 1954, was renamed Steaua.Braga, p.XXXI‚ÄìXXXII; CƒÉlinescu & Vianu, p.152 Among his early assignments there was his participation on the literary jury that granted the magazine's annual prize (alongside literary men such as Paraschivescu, Emil Isac, Dumitru Micu and Iosif Pervain). In one notable incident of 1950, the panel honored a high school student named Ion MotoarcƒÉ, without being aware that MotoarcƒÉ's communist poetry was in fact a parody of Socialist Realist literature, authored as a prank by Baconsky's rival Doina≈ü. As was revealed decades later, Doina≈ü continued to ridicule the Steaua writers over several months, and, when he decided that the risk of repercussions was far too great, simply put an end to the prank. This he did by having MotoarcƒÉ decline all of Baconsky's suggestions with the claim that one \\"should not take lessons from a less gifted poet than himself.\\" In parallel, Anatol E. Baconsky's relationship with Paraschivescu was tense: in February 1951, at a USR meeting in Bucharest, he was one of those who criticized Baconsky's new take on lyric poetry, accusing him of \\"intimism\\". However, in 1952, Paraschivescu left for Bra≈üov, and Baconsky took over as editor of Steaua, progressively changing its profile and shaping it into a literary and art magazine.Braga, p.XXXII; CƒÉlinescu & Vianu, p.152 Fellow poet and essayist Matei CƒÉlinescu, who was acquainted with Baconsky and later joined the Steaua group, believes his older colleague had been \\"rewarded\\" the position by the ruling Romanian Communist Party.CƒÉlinescu & Vianu, p.152 In parallel, he established contacts with young authors in Bucharest, who became Steauas circle in the capital: CƒÉlinescu, Cezar Baltag, Gabriel Dimisianu, Grigore Hagiu, Mircea IvƒÉnescu, Modest Morariu, Nichita StƒÉnescu and Petre Stoica.CƒÉlinescu & Vianu, p.151, 152 Baconsky also published poems in Via≈£a Rom√¢neascƒÉ magazine, including the 1951 Noapte √Æn flƒÉcƒÉri (\\"Night Ablaze\\").Selejan, p.15, 87 In 1952, he was working on translating Stepan Schipachov's poem about Pavlik Morozov, a Soviet boy who had denounced his family for opposing Soviet collectivization, and, after being killed by them, had been celebrated as a communist hero.Selejan, p.15 He was in the process of publishing a series of reportages about the lives of Romanian workers, and, in 1952, stated that he intended to write poetry about life in the factories at Brad, which he had visited. Some of his poems were published in the 1952 volume Poezie nouƒÉ √Æn R.P.R. (\\"New Poetry in the P[eople's] R[epublic of] R[omania]\\"), together with those of Maria Banu≈ü, Dan De≈üliu, Mihu Dragomir, Eugen FrunzƒÉ, ≈ûtefan Iure≈ü, Eugen Jebeleanu, Veronica Porumbacu, Alexandru Toma and twenty-four others.Selejan, p.242‚Äì244 =From Itinerar bulgar to Fluxul memoriei= In January 1953, the 26-year-old poet left Romania on his first trip abroad, visiting the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Back in Bucharest during March, he was present at a USR meeting indirectly provoked by the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, during which they were confronted with the new cultural guidelines stated by Georgy Malenkov. A condemnation of the first- and second-generation proletkult writers, it saw Baconsky both as a critic and a target of criticism.Selejan, p.159, 162 His volume of reportage from the Bulgarian travel, Itinerar bulgar (\\"Bulgarian Itinerary\\"), saw print in 1954, together with the poetry collection C√Æntece de zi ≈üi noapte (\\"Songs of Day and Night\\", awarded the State Prize in 1955). In 1998, literary critic Cornel Ungureanu proposed that, by that moment, Baconsky was finding his voice as a \\"rebellious author\\". According to CƒÉlinescu, the Baconsky of the late 1950s had \\"completely changed his orientation\\". Writing for Steaua in 1955, Baconsky submitted an essay reviewing and promoting the work of George Bacovia, a Symbolist and pessimist who had been largely ignored by post-1948 critics (see Symbolist movement in Romania). Baconsky was again a USR delegate in June 1956, when he presented the body with the first of his reports, dealing with the state of Romanian poetry. This congress, literary critic Paul Cernat notes, coincided with a period when writers sought a \\"regeneration\\", to correspond with the relaxation brought by the death of Stalin. Also that year, he published his DouƒÉ poeme (\\"Two Poems\\") book, comprising C√Æntecul verii acesteia (\\"This Summer's Song\\") and LucrƒÉri ≈üi anotimpuri sau Mi≈ücarea de revolu≈£ie (\\"Labors and Seasons or The Orbital Revolution\\"). In autumn, he left for the Soviet Union and the Far East, visiting North Korea, the People's Republic of China, and Siberian areas. Beginning summer 1956, the communist regime clamped down on the cultural environment, its apprehension motivated by events in Communist Poland, the scene of anti-communist workers' protests, and Communist Hungary, where an anti-Soviet revolt eventually broke out. According to historian Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, Baconsky was one of the writers informed of the decision taken by communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej not to endorse liberalization and destalinization, particularly after the events in Hungary threatened to disrupt communism throughout the Eastern Bloc, and at a time when the regime condemned advocates of change (Miron Constantinescu, Mihail Davidoglu, Alexandru Jar and Ion Vitner).Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, Polirom, Ia≈üi, 2005, p.187. Anatol E. Baconsky was again present in poetry with the 1957 volume Dincolo de iarnƒÉ (\\"Beyond Winter\\"). According to Braga, it was the moment in which his poetry made decisive gains in originality, and the first stage in his renunciation of \\"Proletkult versification\\".Braga, p.IX, XXXII It was followed by a collection of critical essays, Colocviu critic (\\"Critical Colloquy\\").Braga, p.XXXIII In October‚ÄìNovember, Baconsky was again a traveler to the Soviet Union, reaching Moscow, Leningrad and the Baltic, and the northern Black Sea shore. Late in the year, he issued Fluxul memoriei (\\"The Flow of Memory\\"), seen by Braga as \\"essential in the development of his poetry.\\" =Move to Bucharest and debut in publishing= By 1958, Baconsky became a target of criticism in the literary community. The reaction, Braga noted, was \\"vehement\\", and, in January 1959, got Baconsky dismissed from his position as editor of Steaua. In October of that year, the poet left Cluj and settled in Bucharest.Braga, p.XXXIII; CƒÉlinescu & Vianu, p.152 According to Ungureanu, the capital was \\"hostile\\" to Baconsky, and the move was the equivalent of an \\"internal exile\\". Over the following decade, he focused mainly on reeding his earlier volumes of poetry, on publishing works of criticism and travel writing, and on translating works by various authors. His new home became a gathering spot for young writers who did not approve of communism's cultural guidelines, including CƒÉlinescu and other Bucharesters who had previously published their work in Steaua. In 1960, Baconsky published his translation of early Korean poetry (Poe≈£i clasici coreeni) and the reportage volume CƒÉlƒÉtorii √Æn Europa ≈üi Asia (\\"Travels in Europe and Asia\\"), comprising both new works and a reprint of Itinerar bulgar. The following year, he reprinted some of his poems under the title Versuri (\\"Verses\\"), and authored a similarly titled translation from the Italian modernist Salvatore Quasimodo (reprinted 1968).Braga, p.XXXIII, XXXV These were followed in 1962 by his translation of The Long Voyage, a novel by Spanish author Jorge Sempr√∫n (published in Romania under the title Marea cƒÉlƒÉtorie), and the cycle Meridiane (\\"Meridians\\"), comprising essays on 20th century literature, and published over three years by the magazine Contemporanul. Also in 1962, Baconsky published the poetry volume Imn cƒÉtre zorii de zi (\\"A Hymn to Daybreak\\"), and presented a second Writers' Union report (Situa≈£ia poeziei universale contemporane, \\"The State of Contemporary Universal Poetry\\").Braga, p.XXXIV He also left on an extended tour of Moldavia and Northern Dobruja, spending much time in the Danube Delta. A year later, he published a translation of selected poems by Swedish author Artur Lundkvist, an anthology of his own translations from foreign writers (titled Poe≈£i ≈üi poezie‚Äî\\"Poetry and Poets\\"‚Äîand featuring Baconsky's short essays as introductions for each of the authors). His work of the time also comprises the guide book Cluj ≈üi √Æmprejurimile sale. Mic √Ændreptar turistic (\\"Cluj and Its Surroundings. A Concise Tourist Guide\\"). In 1964, having published a new collected volume of his poetry, Baconsky also completed a translation of MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, an ancient Indian epic. Illustrated by Marcela Cordescu in its original print, it carried the subtitle Arderea zmeilor (\\"Burning of the Zmei\\"). His new poetry volume, Fiul risipitor (Romanian for \\"The Prodigal Son\\"), saw print in 1965. =Early Ceau≈üescu years= Baconsky's situation improved during Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's final years in power, and particularly after Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's arrival at the head of the Communist Party inaugurated a period of liberalization. The poet was elected to the Writers' Union Leadership Committee in February 1965. The same month, in this official capacity, he was allowed to travel outside the Iron Curtain and into Western Europe: he was in Austria, invited by the Grazer Autorenversammlung, and also visited France and Italy. Upon his return in April, he passed through Yugoslavia, being welcomed by the Union of Yugoslav Writers. Owing to his new contacts abroad, Baconsky began publishing his work in international reviews, among them France's Cahiers de L'Herne; Austria's Literatur und Kritik and Die Presse; and West Germany's Die Welt, Akzente and Das Ensemble. Following his return, Baconsky published his essay volume Meridiane and a selection of poems translated from the American Carl Sandburg. His own lyrics were published in a Hungarian translation, authored by poet S√°ndor K√°ny√°di.Braga, p.XXXIV‚ÄìXXXV In 1966, Die Welt published the report Baconsky sent to writers participating in the International Congress held in Austria.Braga, p.XXXV In 1967, the writer completed work on his collection of old poetry and new pieces, also titled Fluxul memoriei (\\"The Flow of Memory\\"), and published his debut short story volume, Echinoxul nebunilor ≈üi alte povestiri (\\"The Madmen's Equinox and Other Stories\\"). He revisited Italy and Austria, and, in 1968, traveled to West Germany. In his 1968 two-volume book Remember (title in the original),Braga, p.XXXV; Drace-Francis, p.72‚Äì73 he republished his earlier travel writings into the East with modifications, and added an account of his western travels, headlined Fals jurnal de cƒÉlƒÉtorie (\\"False Travel Journal\\").Drace-Francis, p.72‚Äì73 He also hosted a weekly National Radio program, titled Meridiane lirice (\\"Lyrical Meridians\\")‚ÄîBaconsky read his introductions to works by various writers, and Romanian theater stars read fragments of their work. In November, Anatol E. Baconsky was reelected to the Writers' Union Committee, and, in 1969, his Remember was awarded Steaua 's annual prize. He visited the Hungarian capital Budapest, invited by the local branch of the International PEN. Late in 1969, he published the poetry volume Cadavre √Æn vid (\\"Thermoformed Dead Bodies\\"), which was granted the 1970 Award by the Writers' Union. Also in 1970, his Echinoxul nebunilor was translated into German by Austrian author Max Demeter Peyfuss, being released in Austria, West Germany and Switzerland.Braga, p.XXXV‚ÄìXXXVI The Romanian writer attended the event in Vienna, before leaving for Paris.Braga, p.XXXVI The following year, he traveled to West Germany and again to Austria. Over the following three years, these visits were depicted by Baconsky in his permanent column at the journal Magazin. He also published his first volume on the art of Romania‚Äîa monograph dedicated to and named after painter Dimitrie Ghia≈£ƒÉ. =Final years= By 1971, Baconsky was outraged by the Ceau≈üescu regime having curbed ideological relaxation and proclaimed a Romanian \\"cultural revolution\\" (see July Theses). The following year, invited to a meeting with the new President, he joined sculptor George Apostu in publicly questioning the new guidelines.StejƒÉrel Olaru, \\"Introduction. The Communist Regime and Its Legacy in Romania\\", in StejƒÉrel Olaru, Georg Herbstritt (eds.), Vademekum Contemporary History Romania. A Guide through Archives, Research Institutions, Libraries, Societies, Museums and Memorial Places , Romanian Institute for Recent History, Stiftung f√ºr Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin & Bucharest, 2004, p.31 In February 1972, he settled in West Berlin, after the Academy of Sciences and Humanities offered to host him for one year. He traveled outside the city: invited to Scandinavia by the Swedish Institute, he visited Denmark and Sweden (crossing the Arctic Circle during one trip); he also attended the International Writers' Congress in Austria, and made additional visits to Belgium and the Netherlands. His volume on the art of Ion ≈¢uculescu was published at home during that time. His 1973 anthology of world poetry, Panorama poeziei universale (\\"The Panorama of Universal Poetry\\"), was noted by Hungarian literary historian J√°nos Kohn among similar Romanian works of the period (including Ion Caraion's collection of American poetry), as an important step in the history of Romanian translations.J√°nos Kohn, \\"Romanian tradition\\", in Mona Baker, Kirsten Malmkj√¶r (eds.), Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies, Routledge, London, 2001, p.539. The book, based on the Meridiane lirice program, comprised works by 99 authors, from Endre Ady to William Butler Yeats. Cernat calls the volume \\"fundamental\\". All translations were done by Baconsky himself, whose effort was rewarded by the Writers' Union with its 1973 prize. Together with other poets, he traveled again to Budapest, as part of a cultural exchange between Hungary and Romania, and, in 1974, was again on leave in Italy (invited by academics in the fields of philology and Romanic languages), Austria, and ultimately West Berlin (where the Academy organized a gala in his honor). In 1975, he printed his last anthumous work, an album-monograph dedicated to Quattrocento painter Sandro Botticelli (published by Editura Meridiane).Braga, p.XXXVII He had completed work on his only novel, Biserica neagrƒÉ, whose anti-communist undertones meant that it could not be published at home. Instead, the text circulated in samizdat form, and was made into a series by the Munich-based Radio Free Europe, which broadcast clandestinely inside Romania. In March 1977, Baconsky and his wife Clara fell victims to the 7.2 Mw Vrancea earthquake which devastated Bucharest. At the time, Baconsky was preparing for a new trip abroad: complying with Communist Romania's restrictions on the use of passports, he had just asked authorities to release the document, and was carrying it on his person. His last volumes, Biserica neagrƒÉ and Corabia lui Sebastian (\\"Sebastian's Ship\\"), remained unpublished. Work, style and creative periods =Communism and Socialist Realism= After his short affiliation to Surrealism, a style which is almost entirely absent from his published work, Baconsky embraced a style which reflected his communist sympathies, and which is most often seen as the source of some of his poorest work. Cornel Ungureanu describes the early 1950s Baconsky as \\"an exponent of socialist realism\\" and a \\"passionate supporter of the communist utopia\\"; his stance in respect to the authorities was described by literary historian Alex Drace-Francis as \\"conformist\\"Drace-Francis, p.72 (a word also used by CƒÉlinescu), while Paul Cernat circumscribes Baconsky to the \\"pure and tough Stalinism\\" of the day. His early works are seen by literary critic Sorin Tomu≈£a as \\"an unfortunate debut with conjectural lyrics\\".Sorin Tomu≈£a, biographical note to A. E. Baconsky, \\"Remember. Viena\\", in Babe≈£i & Ungureanu, p.84 Likened by Matei CƒÉlinescu to the debut writings of the younger communist author Dan De≈üliu, they became the topic of criticism from as early as the Nicolae Ceau≈üescu years: Mircea Braga called them \\"platitudes\\" and \\"at most, documents for a certain mindset and 'artistic' practice\\", noting that their own author had come to reject them in later years.Braga, p.IX He also cites fellow critic Alexandru Piru, who defines Baconsky's early productions as bearing \\"the strong imprint of journalism\\". This series included controversial stanzas about communization, the Romanian collectivization process, and class struggle against wealthy peasants known as chiaburi (Romanian for kulaks). Bogdan Cre≈£u, \\"A. E. Baconsky: un destin contorsionat, oglindit √Æn propria operƒÉ\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, October 2007 Other portions of his work were dedicated to industrialization policies, around subjects related to Brad factories. Discussing his projects for 1952 in an interview with Contemporanul, Baconsky explained: \\"I am especially interested in the matter of engineers who rose from the ranks of young workers. I want to follow [their] transformation on all levels and create the figure of a young engineer in one of my poems.\\" One of his best-known poems of the period has to do with the chiaburi, and includes the lines: Other such lyrics read: Former Romanian Communist Party activist Pavel »öugui, whose opinions diverged from the party line, claimed that, in effect, Baconsky was writing with subversive undertones from the time of his debut‚Äîliterary chronicler Bogdan Cre≈£u renders this opinion, but expresses doubt, calling »öugui \\"dubious\\" and \\"in reality, a politruk as sinister as all the others.\\" Literary historian Eugen Simion also proposed that Baconsky was, in effect, parodying agitprop literature of the day. Analyzing Baconsky's early political views, his biographer Crina Bud concludes that the poet was attracted into cooperation in order to make a living, and that, from the very start, he was playing a number of different and conflicting \\"roles\\". The writer was already noted for being a man of refined tastes and for being interested by universal culture. Both Cre≈£u and Cernat define him as \\"a dandy of communism\\". The \\"dandy\\" trait had also been noted by Eugen Simion.Braga, p.VII Simion, who recorded his impression of Baconsky, spoke of his \\"romantic beauty\\", \\"sartorial elegance\\", and a form of \\"melancholy\\" which, he argued, recalled that displayed by 19th century author G√©rard de Nerval. Historian Vladimir TismƒÉneanu sees Anatol E. Baconsky as one of the few genuine left-wing intellectuals who remained associated with the regime throughout the 1950s (in his definition, the group also comprised Geo Bogza, Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu, Geo Dumitrescu, Petru Dumitriu, Paul Georgescu, Gheorghe Haupt, Eugen Jebeleanu, Mihail Petroveanu and Nicolae Tertulian). During his period at Steaua, Baconsky encouraged young authors to express themselves and created, what both Tomu≈£a and Cre≈£u define as a \\"literary oasis\\". TismƒÉneanu however criticizes the writer and other leftists on the cultural scene for not reacting against the post-1956 repressive mood, and argues that their inaction helped ideologists Leonte RƒÉutu and his subordinate Mihai Beniuc to restore Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's control over the Writers' Union. A particular controversy involves allegations against the young Baconsky for the way in which he treated his colleagues. Many voices in the literary community have come to suspect that he was an informant for the Securitate secret police, and that his reports helped in the arrest of other writers. Crina Bud proposes that, if such accounts are true, Baconsky may have used the Securitate in order to silence those who competed with him for the approval of his teacher, philosopher Lucian Blaga. The accusations are traced by Cernat to two separate sources: Baconsky's adversaries in the Sibiu Literary Circle and Securitate general Nicolae Ple≈üi≈£ƒÉ. During his early activities in Cluj, Baconsky is also alleged to have partaken in the marginalization of a less enthusiastic writer, Ion Dezideriu S√Ærbu, who was later to become a political prisoner (in S√Ærbu's memoirs, Baconsky is singled out as one of those who betrayed his confidence). =Break with communism= Despite initially complying with ideological requirements, Baconsky was often subject to criticism in the official press. This occurred frequently after 1953, when Soviet politico Georgy Malenkov disavowed proletkult, criticizing its exponents for having authored a bland and distant form of literature (an accusation which Baconsky was regularly faced with from that moment on).Selejan, p.87, 162, 197‚Äì201, 206, 245‚Äì251, 253‚Äì254, 256‚Äì257, 263‚Äì265, 333‚Äì334 Criticism was expressed early on by poet Veronica Porumbacu, who reproached him having published too little \\"when the people is asking us to participate with all forces in the struggle.\\"Selejan, p.162 Also in 1953, Paul Georgescu, literary columnist at Sc√Ænteia, the main Communist Party organ, reacted against the Steaua leadership, and argued that Baconsky personally had developed \\"a high-flown style, designed to hide his unfamiliarity with life and lack of ideas.\\"Selejan, p.197 Georgescu also claimed that Baconsky's travel accounts had failed to show \\"how [Bulgarian] people live, how this country looks today [...]\\",Selejan, p.198 and that his poems displayed various ideological mistakes.Selejan, p.198‚Äì201 Writing for Via≈£a Rom√¢neascƒÉ, critic Eugen Campus endorsed earlier pronouncements and added that, although Baconsky was a \\"talented poet\\", he found his contributions showed \\"a tendency to repeat oneself‚Äîfor all the originality it covets\\".Selejan, p.206 Literary historian Ana Selejan notes that, upon the end of the debates, the poet found himself was \\"blacklisted\\" by the official critics.Selejan, p.251 In parallel, Baconsky criticized other writers on similar grounds. He aimed such remarks at his fellow poet Eugen FrunzƒÉ, which brought him additional criticism from Georgescu and Mircea Gafi≈£a.Selejan, p.199, 200‚Äì201, 245‚Äì251, 253‚Äì254 Several of Baconsky's poems, in particular the 1953 RutinƒÉ (\\"Routine\\"), satirize authors who did not seek to make their poems interesting to the general public.Selejan, p.198, 202‚Äì203, 288‚Äì290 The latter, Selejan proposes, may be a covert reference to and ironic pastiche of Mihai Beniuc, one of the Socialist Realist poets most trusted by the regime.Selejan, p.290 One of the stanzas reads: Selejan also notes that RutinƒÉ, like the war poem Manifest (\\"Manifesto\\"), constitute a \\"dissonant note\\" when compared with other poems of the day, including those of Beniuc.Selejan, p.289 Manifest, which may have been written in honor of the Romanian-hosted World Festival of Youth and Students (1953), and which Selejan believes may display irony toward \\"poetic militantism in the present tense\\", compares the fate of World War II soldiers with that of post-1945 youth, in meditative lyrics such as: Progressively after the late 1950s, Baconsky entirely lost his confidence in communism‚Äîan attitude which culminated in his 1972 protest. His disappointment was especially known to his intimate circle.CƒÉlinescu & Vianu, p.152-153 Based on this, Cernat defines the writer as an \\"informal anti-communist\\", while CƒÉlinescu, who recalls participating in such conversations, notes: \\"Baconsky [displayed] an emphatic, lucid, irreconcilable anti-communism. Not even later [...] did I meet many people who had a more emphasized contempt, mixed with an intense repulsion, for the representatives of the [communist] party ideology, either within the literary world or outside it.\\" He believes Baconsky's stance from 1958 onwards makes him the period's \\"only dissident\\", although he also notes that the poet criticized the communist system only \\"orally\\". Cornel Ungureanu, who stresses the importance of both his move to Bucharest and the numerous visits abroad, adds: \\"[he] was to walk down a road which most celebrity authors of the 1950s' communist east [...] have walked down on: the one between fanatical exaltation and acute misanthropies.\\" According to Bogdan Cre≈£u, 1967, when Echinoxul nebunilor was published, was the capital moment in Baconsky's non-compliance with the ideological requirements, with \\"more than honorable behavior\\" defining the second part of his career. However, Cernat speculates, the theory regarding his alleged collaboration to Securitate may offer clue that Baconsky's new stance was itself orchestrated by the Party, in an attempt to offer him credibility and permit him to sabotage the literary environment. Baconsky allowed his intellectual opposition to communism to merge with his activities as a cultural promoter. In addition to promoting the work of George Bacovia, Baconsky had sought to republish the works of Mateiu Caragiale and his Decadent novel Craii de Curtea-Veche, but his efforts had been frustrated, and (according to Eugen Simion, their only effect was that Sc√Ænteia resumed its earlier campaign against Caragiale).Eugen Simion, \\"Arta marelui Mateiu...\\", in Curentul, December 29, 2001 In the climate of relative liberalization coinciding with Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's early years in office, his anthologies and essays helped reinstate works of literature who had been previously censored. Ungureanu thus notes that Baconsky reintroduced the Romanian public to works of Central European authors, such as Franz Kafka and Ingeborg Bachmann, and argues: \\"He is the first one (or among the first ones) to 'reconquer' the Mitteleuropean space for Romanian culture.\\" Cernat portrays him as a \\"European humanist with a vast and refined culture\\", while Cre≈£u proposes that Baconsky and his generation colleague ≈ûtefan Augustin Doina≈ü may be Romania's \\"best translators of poetry\\". By 1970, Baconsky's younger colleague Gabriel Dimisianu notes, he had become one of the \\"writers and literary critics who had initially paid a toll to proletkultism, and now were silently parting with it, returning to literature, to actual criticism\\".Gabriel Dimisianu, B. Elvin, \\"Dialog. Genera≈£ie ≈üi crea≈£ie\\", in Lettre Internationale Romanian edition, Summer 2008 This group, defined by Dimisianu as \\"the older allies of my generation\\", also includes Paraschivescu, Geo Bogza, Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu, Geo Dumitrescu, Eugen Jebeleanu, Marin Preda, Zaharia Stancu, as well as Baconsky's former rival Paul Georgescu. =Lyrical transition= Following his break with the regime, Baconsky's style underwent major changes. Tomu≈£a notes he became \\"a first-rate stylist\\", while Doina≈ü stresses his \\"discreet but tenacious self-edification\\", leading to \\"an ardent consciousness, albeit perhaps belatedly gained\\".Braga, p.VI The new direction, heralded during his time at Steaua, was however much-criticized by the 1950s cultural establishment, who accused him of \\"intimism\\" and excessive \\"lyricism\\", and argued that his work was a return to aestheticism and Symbolism.Braga, p.IX-X Baconsky resisted such criticism, and, in one of his articles, openly stated that poets needed to return to a lyrical approach: \\"Ignoring the rich array of intimate feelings means mutilating the protagonist's personality, depicting him unilaterally, belittling the actual dimensions of his soul.\\"Braga, p.X Matei CƒÉlinescu argues that such a commitment to artistic purity was a sign of \\"what we could call the 'aesthetic resistance' to communism.\\" According to Badea, such experiments resulted in Baconsky's originality, \\"an anti-metaphoric offensive, built upon the confrontation between the life of lyrical characters with the destiny of ideal lives\\". The rejection of \\"decorative metaphors\\", Cernat notes, was a staple of Baconsky's work, and was explicitly stated in his post-1969 essays. Badea added that this Dincolo de iarnƒÉ, and the volumes which followed down to 1965, formed \\"the first page in a distinct chapter of our modern lyric poetry.\\"Braga, p.XII Eugen Simion emphasized as the common trait of such poems: \\"a voluptuousness in things fading away, in the weariness provoked by the whispers of rain.\\"Braga, p.XI In his definition, Baconsky had become \\"an aesthete of melancholy.\\" Baconsky's poems of the period speak of himself being \\"torn\\" by the contradictions of destiny, submitted to the command of a nature whose geography, Braga notes, is \\"dead\\", seeking to undermine his own humanity so as to become the ideal creator.Braga, p.XII‚ÄìXIII Also according to Mircea Braga, \\"the manifesto of [Baconsky's] onthologic unease\\" is his Imn cƒÉtre nelini≈üte (\\"Hymn to Disquiet\\"): It was also at this stage that the poet began introducing references to remote or exotic locations in his works. His poems began to speak of mysterious Baltic and Northern European landscapes, of ancient roads, medieval settings and the desolation of history, as well as of Romania's natural sights (the Danube Delta and the Carpathian Mountains) and scenes from Romanian history (involving the Dacians, the Scythes and the Thracians, or the Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great).Braga, p.XVI‚ÄìXIX, XXI‚ÄìXXII, XXVII‚ÄìXXVIII The pieces show his enduring fascination with water environments, references to which, according to Braga, he used to illustrate the \\"all-encompassing dynamic.\\"Braga, p.XIX =Cadavre √Æn vid and Corabia lui Sebastian= With the somber collection Cadavre √Æn vid, Baconsky entered what Braga calls a \\"forth artistic phase\\" (after Surrealism, Socialist Realism and the first change in orientation). Braga however insists that the change between the final two phases is not radical, and that they are separated by a break rather than a tear.Braga, p.XI, XXXVIII Braga also believes that, in his depictions of melancholy and disease, Baconsky again focuses on unease and \\"the denial of the irreplaceable\\" (while letting the reader know that such a denial is \\"useless and inefficient\\").Braga, p.XVI In a 1985 essay, poet and critic Dinu FlƒÉm√¢nd discusses Cadavre √Æn vid as \\"a book of suffering, unique in our literature, a tragic perception of the disinherited, a nightmare of teratologic dreams in the new 'electronic season' \\". It includes Sonet negru (\\"Black Sonnet\\"), which Braga calls an \\"exceptional\\" sample of \\"feverish tensions, infinite searches [...], obscure impulses\\":Braga, p.XIII Mircea Braga writes that this and other late volumes, showing \\"a world born out of nightmares\\", are the product of several influences: alongside George Bacovia's melancholic poems, they host echoes from both Expressionism and Postmodern literature.Braga, p.XXII‚ÄìXXIII FlƒÉm√¢nd ranks the posthumous Corabia lui Sebastian among \\"the best works written in this second half of the [20th] century\\", and compares its \\"cynicism\\" to the existential philosophy of Emil Cioran.Braga, p.V By that stage, Baconsky also became noted for theorizing the rejection of \\"consumerism\\", advocating instead a return to established cultural values. According to FlƒÉm√¢nd's 1985 essay, Baconsky's rejection of \\"consumerism\\" and the West was decisive, and culminated in a virulent decision of what Baconsky is known to have called \\"the occidental pharaoh\\". Braga also writes that, in both Cadavre √Æn vid and Corabia lui Sebastian, Baconsky depicts his own version of a \\"crisis of the West\\" (the Abendland forming a setting of one poem), which he believed may have referenced Oswald Spengler's similar verdict (see The Decline of the West).Braga, p.XXIII‚ÄìXXVI Diana C√¢mpan noted the poems' dystopian imagery: \\"The Abendland is [...] an eerie Leviathan-like corpus, with attributes defining for humanity's decrepitude, a surrogate, anti-utopian citadel, handled in accordance with the laws of decline which grind the elites as well as the masses, the things as well their reflection\\".C√¢mpan, p.103 A part of the eponymous poem reads: According to Mircea Braga, one of his last interviews shows that, while still criticized for \\"aestheticism\\", Baconsky merged his lyricism with an interest in social matters.Braga, p.XXII The statement reads: \\"The writer is not a politician in the common and consecrated sense of the word. He does however have the role of a spiritual ferment [italics in the original]. He must not allow people to acquire cerebral obesity. He is always dissatisfied with something or other, his position is that of a permanent antithesis with the surrounding reality.\\" Braga believes Baconsky's moral \\"rigor\\" to bear a \\"Transylvanian sign\\", and to have been ultimately inspired by the philosophy of Lucian Blaga. The related anti-capitalist vision is questioned by Cernat. The critic indicates that, although sincere in its patriotism, it was also \\"compatible\\" with the mixture of communism and nationalism introduced by the Ceau≈üescu regime (see National communism), and thus similar with the philosophical discourse of Constantin Noica. =Late prose works= With Remember, Drace-Francis argues, Baconsky advanced a technique first used by avant-garde writers of the 1930s, which transcended the norms imposed by traditional travel accounts in order to express \\"the inadequate representational possibilities of traditional forms\\" and to comment on the metaphysics of reality.Drace-Francis, p.73 Baconsky thus depicts his journey as an \\"interior adventure\\". This type of discourse, Drace- Francis contends, was a hint to his readers that the regime would not allow him to recount every detail of his journey. The book nevertheless also doubles as Baconsky's extended critique of the avant-garde of Europe, whose discourse, Diana C√¢mpan notes, Baconsky depicted as a form of desecration.C√¢mpan, p.101-103 In Tomu≈£a's view, the depiction of Vienna, with a focus on \\"the glorious vestiges of the past\\", takes the reader on a \\"voluptuous time travel.\\" In the critic's definition, Baconsky's Vienna encloses a secondary reality, that is \\"ideal\\", \\"aestheticized\\", \\"fictional\\" and \\"bookish\\". Drace- Francis also notes that the climate of relative liberalization and d√©tente of the 1960s not only made such journeys possible, but actually allowed writers the freedom to go beyond stereotyped depictions of capitalism (while it remained uncertain whether Communist Romania's dialog with the West would \\"dominate the construction of epistemic value\\"). Overall, Cornel Ungureanu comments, Baconsky's accounts of his western travels are marked by \\"dark visions of the world.\\" Ungureanu sees this as a sign of Baconsky's having \\"descended into Hell\\". Cernat, who extends his critique of Baconsky's anti- capitalist attitude to Remember, also argues that the author's \\"absolute freedom\\" of travel under a repressive regime indicates that his work was not perceived as a threat by the communist system. Baconsky's prose fiction is closely linked to the themes and style of his poetry. In Braga's view, the fantasy collection Echinoxul nebunilor is a prosaic representative of its author's early commitment to aestheticism; according to Cernat, its tone is \\"apocalyptic\\". A characteristic of Baconsky's prose fiction is its resemblance to his poetry works, to the point where they were described by Crina Bud as \\"hybrid forms\\". In Bogdan Cre≈£u's view, Biserica neagrƒÉ, Baconsky's only novel, is written with \\"alexandrine-like purity\\". Likewise, the Corabia lui Sebastian poems were noted for moving into the realm of prose. This transgression of limits summoned objections from prominent literary critic Nicolae Manolescu, who reportedly believed Baconsky's work to be largely without merit. Biserica neagrƒÉ is also read as his most subversive work, described by critics as a \\"counter-utopia\\". Ungureanu sees it as a \\"Kafkaesque\\" work of absurdist inspiration, and a further sign of the author \\"descending into Hell\\". Crina Bud links the anti-utopian quality to contemporary writings by, among others, Matei CƒÉlinescu (Via≈£a ≈üi opiniile lui Zacharias Lichter, \\"The Life and Opinions of Zacharias Lichter\\") and Baconsky's friend Octavian Paler (Via≈£a pe un peron‚Äî\\"Life on a Platform\\"; Un om norocos‚Äî\\"A Lucky Man\\"). Written from the perspective of a sculptor, who is probably a transposition of Baconsky himself, it is a parable of totalitarian command, artistic submission, individual despair and withdrawal. The volume also offers a glimpse into the world of political imprisonment under communism. Legacy Anatol E. Baconsky was a noted presence in the literary community of his day, and is believed to have influenced poet, novelist and translator Petre Stoica (who is described by Ungureanu as the writer's \\"friend and emulator\\"). Baconsky's poems were parodied by Marin Sorescu in his 1964 volume, Singur printre poe≈£i (\\"Alone among Poets\\"). Sorescu's poem, titled A. E. Baconsky. Imn cƒÉtre necunoscutul din mine (\\"Hymn to the Unknown within Me\\"), makes use of Baconsky's lyrical style and displays of culture, showing the poet meditating about the ancient Scythian and Thracian peoples. It begins with the lines: Unusual episodes involving Baconsky's death were reported by two of his writer friends, Octavian Paler and Petre Stoica‚ÄîPaler recalled that the only book to have fallen out of his shelf during the 1977 earthquake was Remember; Stoica told a similar story involving a painting that Baconsky had made, and which he had received as a gift. The writer's death, Cernat writes, was a \\"troubling coincidence\\" with that of Alexandru Ivasiuc: a former communist who, like Baconsky, had \\"radicalized\\" his vision and authored non- conformist pieces, Ivasiuc was himself a victim of the 1977 earthquake. In the months following Baconsky's death, his new monograph on Sandro Botticelli, centered on the artist's illustrations for Dante Aligheri's Divine Comedy, was published in Romanian (re-issued in English during 1982). Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ reprinted Remember (1977), then Corabia lui Sebastian (1978). Also in 1978, his profile was included in 9 pentru eternitate (\\"9 for Eternity\\"), a volume dedicated to the literary men who had died during the earthquake, and edited by Mircea Micu and Gheorghe Tomozei. Eleven years later, a selection of his art criticism essays was published under the title Itinerarii plastice (\\"Artistic Itineraries\\"). Biserica neagrƒÉ was only printed after the 1989 Revolution toppled communism. Of the several books dedicated to his life and work, Crina Bud's 2006 volume, Rolurile ≈üi rolul lui A. E. Baconsky √Æn cultura rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"The Roles and Role of A. E. Baconsky in Romanian Culture\\"), is described by reviewers as one of the most complete. Bogdan Cre≈£u comments that views of Baconsky are traditionally divided between two \\"extremist\\" positions: \\"he was either castigated for his sins of youth [...] or mythicized and raised to a level that his work could not have honored.\\" Like Crina Bud, he believes Baconsky to have been a \\"vanquisher from a moral point of view\\", adding that he earned \\"absolution\\" from the victims of communism: \\"the writer passed the fire ordeal: he confessed.\\" However, Cernat believes, Baconsky, like his fellow disillusioned communist Paler, refused to record his disappointment in writing other than allusively. Baconsky and his wife Clara were noted art collectors. They owned representative works of Romanian art, particularly modern, including paintings by Dimitrie Ghia≈£ƒÉ, ≈ûtefan Dimitrescu, Iosif Iser and Lucian Grigorescu, as well as drawings by Constantin Jiquidi, Theodor Pallady and Nicolae Tonitza. Colec≈£ia Clara ≈üi Anatol E. Baconsky, at the National Museum of Art of Romania; retrieved July 19, 2008 Their collection also included 19th century Romanian Orthodox icons and early prints from William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress. In 1982, the family donated these works to the National Museum, which set up a Baconsky Collection. 21 other works were donated to the Museum of Art Collections, where they also form a separate fund. Florena Dobrescu, \\"Muzeul Colec≈£iilor de ArtƒÉ a fost redeschis publicului\\", in AdevƒÉrul, December 27, 2003 Many of the books owned by Baconsky were donated by his brother Leon to the Library in CƒÉlimƒÉne≈üti (which was consequently renamed the Anatol E.

It set style for the era, was sung about in popular culture, and was copied by others around the world. The car is now preserved in the Graceland museum, in Memphis, Tennessee. History In early 1955, Elvis bought his first Cadillac, a 1954 Fleetwood Series 60, which was the color pink. The car provided transport for Elvis and the Blue Moon Boys, but after the failure of a brake lining, was destroyed in a roadside fire between Hope and Texarkana, Arkansas, on June 5, 1955. On July 5, 1955, Elvis purchased a new Cadillac Fleetwood Series 60 in blue with a black roof. Having mentioned a Pink Cadillac in the song \\"Baby, Let's Play House\\", the first song recorded by Elvis to appear on a national chart which made #5 on the Billboard Country Singles chart in July 1955;The Blue Moon Boys - The Story of Elvis Presley's Band. Ken Burke and Dan Griffin. 2006. Chicago Review Press. page 47. Elvis had the car repainted by Art, a neighbour on Lamar Street. Art designed a customised pink color for Elvis which he named \\"Elvis Rose,\\" but the car kept its black roof. Once the car was finished Elvis gave it to his mother Gladys as a gift. Mrs. Gladys Presley never had a driver's license, and Elvis drove the car with the members of his band for most of 1955‚Äì1956. The Pink Cadillac displayed in March 2012 On September 2, 1955, Scotty Moore drove the car into a vehicle which was passing a pick-up truck in Texarkana, Texas, causing $1000 of damage. Having signed his contract with RCA in November 1955, in March 1956 Elvis had the upholstery replaced, the body retouched and roof painted white. (As can be seen in the book \\"A Boy from Tupelo\\", from FTD/2012, in 1955 the Cadillac already has the white roof). On his return from military service in Germany in 1960, Presley lent the car to his US Army buddy Joe Esposito, having bought himself a white with pink roofed 1961 Cadillac Coupe de Ville. The original pink Cadillac remains on permanent display at Graceland, formerly under a carport for many years, and now resident in the auto museum. The car was once again brought to the front drive entrance of Graceland in June 2006, during the visit of President George W. Bush and Prime Minister of Japan Junichiro Koizumi. Pink Cadillacs in popular culture At the time, Ford Motor Co. was the only manufacturer to offer pink as a standard color. After the public attention to Elvis' car many individual car owners in the 1950s began to paint their cars various shades of pink. Although the original car was a 1955 four-door sedan, the more replicated version in popular culture is a pink 1959 Cadillac Series 62 Convertible, which have been sold as miniature replicas by many companies including Franklin Mint, and featured in songs and videos about the pink Cadillac. Pink Cadillacs have also been the automobiles of recognition for their top sales people by Mary Kay Cosmetics. Elvis Presley appears in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams‚Äîhe is depicted as driving a pink spaceship. Elvis' Pink Cadillac was the inspiration for Robert Dunn's musical novel Pink Cadillac (2002). In the novel Elvis makes a cameo appearance, giving the heroine, Daisy Holliday, one of his pink Cadillacs as a gift after she helps him get it running. Elvis' Pink Cadillac was featured in the CBS miniseries Elvis, where it shows him first buying the car for his mother. =Krentzman copy= In December 2006 the historians of Graceland documented and provided 125 detailed color photographs of the entire car so that Bonnie and Stewart Krentzman of River Vale, New Jersey could re- create Elvis' famous pink Cadillac in exacting detail. Pantone color swatches were used to match the pink and white exterior and interior paint. It was stipulated in the agreement with Graceland that this, the only \\"twin sister\\" and exact re-creation of the original car, would be offered at no charge to \\"pink ribbon\\" breast cancer fund-raising organizations to help raise money for breast cancer research and education. It has been estimated that close to 200,000 photos have been taken with this re-creation at breast cancer fund raising events. On occasion Diamond Joe Esposito, Elvis' road manager has appeared with the Krentzman car. The Krentzman car made its first appearance at Susan G. Komen's mother and daughter Color Me Pink Event in New York City in April 2007. It has since appeared at many Susan G. Komen, Avon and Revlon Walks in addition to being used by many grassroots breast cancer organizations across the United States.Foreign Policy, June 30, 2006 =Songs and films about pink Cadillacs= *Pink Cadillac, a 1979 album by John Prine *\\"Pink Cadillac\\", a 1983 song by Bruce Springsteen, later covered in 1986 by Southern Pacific and in 1988 by Natalie Cole *\\"Freeway of Love\\", a Grammy-winning 1985 song by Aretha Franklin *Pink Cadillac, a 1989 film starring Clint Eastwood References Have no other way to suggest to whoever is manning this page that this is the best photo for the page.

He served as a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War and was most noted for his service in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. He was influential in convincing a veteran United States Army general to peacefully abandon Federal-held military installations to the Confederacy before the start of the war, providing the fledgling nation with much needed arms and munitions. Early life and career Philip N. Luckett was born in Virginia. He attended medical school and became a physician. As a young adult, he moved to Ohio, where he was offered an appointment to the United States Military Academy.Webb, p. 544; see also Register of Graduates and Former Cadets of the United States Military Academy, by the West Point Alumni Association, p. 177. In 1847, he moved, this time to Corpus Christi, Texas. He volunteered as the physician for the famed Texas Rangers, serving the company commanded by Captain John \\"Rip\\" Ford for most of the decade of the 1840s. Luckett became an ardent advocate of states' rights. He was suspected of being involved with the Knights of the Golden Circle. Luckett was elected as a delegate from Nueces and Webb counties to the Texas state secession convention in the mid-winter of 1861. After Texas passed its ordinance of secession, Luckett was one of four men appointed as commissioners of public safety to negotiate with the Federal government for the safe transfer of military installations and bases in Texas to the Confederates. Along with land baron Samuel A. Maverick and Thomas J. Devine, Luckett met on February 8, 1861, with United States Army General David E. Twiggs to arrange the surrender of the Federal property in San Antonio, including the military stores being housed in the old Alamo mission. As a result of the negotiations, Twiggs delivered his entire command and its associated Army property to the Confederacy.Evans, pp. 20-22. Luckett's lineage was (starting with the most distant known ancestor and working down through the generations): Samuel Luckett and wife Elizabeth Hussey, Samuel Luckett (2nd generation), Lt. Colonel William Luckett (3rd), Thomas Hussey Luckett (4th) and Elizabeth Noland, Otho Holland William Luckett (5th), himself. At least the first 3 generations were Marylanders. William Luckett of the 3rd generation was notable for his military service in the Revolution and for his being one of the \\"12 Immortal Justices\\" who combined on a decision striking down the Stamp Act on November 23, 1765, an event since commemorated officially as Repudiation Day in Maryland. Civil War Following the bombardment of Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Dr. Luckett was appointed as the Quartermaster General of the newly organized Confederate forces in Texas. He served on the staff of the commander of the Department of Texas, Earl Van Dorn. He rode northward from his Corpus Christi home on a recruiting expedition, seeking volunteers to travel to designated recruiting camps in Austin and San Antonio. By May, his efforts were paying off, and hundreds of men had signed up for Confederate service thanks to Luckett's efforts. In the autumn of 1861, Luckett was elected as colonel of the recently raised 3rd Texas Infantry, a regiment he helped raise during his recruiting trip. Luckett and his 648 men were initially assigned to Colonel Ford's Western Subdistrict of Texas and encamped along the Rio Grande for several months, starting in December.Evans, p. 54. Beginning in October 1862, Luckett and the 3rd Texas garrisoned a number of widely scattered posts from Fort Brown to Laredo. After spending the winter on the frontier manning a defensive line near the Brazos River just southwest of Houston, the 3rd Texas moved from Brownsville to Galveston, arriving in the coastal town on July 12, 1863. Within a few weeks, Luckett received a brevet promotion to brigadier general. By early August, he was back in Brownsville, having succeeded Rip Ford as subdistrict commander. Luckett's men were reassigned in April 1864 to the front lines, serving in the brigade of Brig. Gen. William R. Scurry of Walker's Texas Division during the Red River Campaign. During the Camden Expedition, Luckett's regiment participated in the climatic Battle of Jenkins' Ferry, where Walker's \\"Greyhounds\\" helped repulse a Federal force under Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele. Luckett assumed command of the brigade following Scurry's death and led it for the balance of the year. However, a combination of illness and detached duty kept Luckett from any further front line duty as the war waned in early 1865. He served as a judge on the court of inquiry into Sterling Price's disastrous Missouri Raid. Postbellum activities With the collapse of the Confederacy in April and May 1865, Luckett, a firebrand secessionist, refused to surrender to Federal authorities. Instead, he and a group of forty men accompanied General John G. Walker across the Rio Grande into Mexico. In November of that year, Dr. Luckett returned to Texas. However, he, along with fellow commissioner of safety Thomas Devine, was arrested by Federal authorities. He was transported to Fort Jackson, Louisiana, near New Orleans, and incarcerated over the winter. Efforts on his behalf were successful, and he was finally released from prison. However, Luckett's health was broken; he spent several months in New Orleans recuperating. He was finally well enough to travel north to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he lived with several relatives until his death in May 1869. Notes References *Evans, Clement A., Confederate Military History.

From 1968, he was the lead singer and bass guitarist in popular Swedish band Bamboo. The band released two singles before breaking up in 1970. Rickfors would later perform with the British rock group The Hollies for about two years.The Hollies: Band Profile ‚Äì Past Members ‚Äì Mikael Rickfors , accessed 24 May 2010 His performing style during this period was with a wide range and powerful chest voice. In later decades, he took on a deliberate, slightly raspy tone. The Hollies In early 1972, Rickfors joined popular British rock group The Hollies replacing the lead singer Allan Clarke, who had left to pursue a solo career. Rickfors's richer lower-register voice contrasted to Clarke's distinctive, piercing tenor. One of their hits that both performed was \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\". Rickfors performed this ballad with more dramatic tone and a slight vibrato, such as that performed on The Midnight Special in 1973. His first single with the group \\"The Baby\\" reached no. 26 in the UK as well as charting in various other territories. The band followed up by releasing the album Romany, with one song, \\"Touch,\\" written by Rickfors. Mikael also sang the band's hit \\"Magic Woman Touch\\" and the European 45 \\"Don't Leave The Child Alone\\" which he also wrote. The group received an unexpected boost as a single extracted from the group's previous album (with Clarke's vocals) shot up the American charts. The Hollies undertook their first major US tour without their signature vocalist. The tour was not a commercial success. The band then recorded a second album, Out on the Road which featured a major songwriting contribution from Rickfors. On both albums and on stage Rickfors also sang, played guitar, bass, congas and keyboard. Out on the Road was originally only released in Germany and Spain but later was included in the multi album Hollies box set ‚ÄúChangin‚Äô Times‚Äù released in 2015. In July 1973, Clarke rejoined the Hollies and Rickfors departed the group. Solo In 1975 Rickfors released the first of eleven solo albums. 1988 saw the release of his hugely successful Vingar album. In 1990, he embarked on his first collaboration as part of the Swedish supergroup Grymlings (named after Rickfors' farm). Among the artists who have recorded songs Mikael has written, in addition to The Hollies, are: Carlos Santana (\\"Daughter of the Night\\"), Cyndi Lauper (\\"Yeah Yeah\\" on her multi-million selling debut album), Percy Sledge (\\"Blue Night\\", \\"Misty Morning\\", \\"Shining Through the Rain\\", \\"Road of No Return\\"), Richie Havens, Jim Capaldi, Carla Olson, and Paul Jones (on his 2009 solo album Starting All Over Again).

During the early summer, he left his home state and headed for Poland, Ohio where, on June 21, he enrolled for Civil War military service, and mustered in as a private with Company E of the 23rd Ohio Infantry. After fighting with his regiment in the Battle of Carnifex Ferry, Virginia on September 10, he was then wounded in action in Maryland on September 18 while fighting with his regiment near Antietam. Shot in the left hand by a rifle, he sustained further damage when the ball traveled up and through his wrist joint. After three months of treatment for his injuries and subsequent convalescence at a Union Army hospital in New York, he returned to service with the 23rd Ohio at its headquarters at Camp White in West Virginia, but was quickly discharged on a surgeon's certificate and sent home to Pennsylvania when his superiors determined that he was still not fully recuperated.Hruska, Judy. \\"Cyrus B.

Early life He was the son of Dr. Ananias Cooper and Elizabeth DeKay Cooper. He studied medicine with Dr. Crosby in New York City and became a physician, like his father. By 1791, Cooper had settled in Albany. In 1792 he began to practice medicine. Career In 1794, he was appointed Health Officer of the Port of Albany In February 1804, Cooper attended a dinner party during which Alexander Hamilton spoke forcefully and eloquently against the Federalists' plan to nominate Aaron Burr as their candidate for Governor of New York. Cooper later wrote a letter to Philip Schuyler, Alexander Hamilton's father-in-law, in which he made reference to the \\"despicable opinion\\" Hamilton had expressed about Burr. The letter was published in The Albany Register, but was tame compared to other attacks on Burr in the press. Still, Cooper's letter proved the last straw in the ongoing rivalry between Burr and Hamilton. When Burr read the letter weeks later, shortly after his defeat in the governor's race, he was enraged by Hamilton's alleged remarks, and challenged Hamilton to a duel, in which Hamilton was killed. From March 1806 to June 1807, Cooper was First Judge of the Albany County Court. From 1815 to 1816, he was a member of the Erie Canal Commission. In April 1817, while his father-in-law was Acting Governor, Cooper was appointed Secretary of State of New York. Personal life He married Margaret Vernor (-1860), the adopted daughter of the future Lt. Gov. John Tayler and the former Margarita Van Valkenburgh. They had five children, including: * John Tayler Cooper (1798‚Äì1878), a lawyer and Major- General who married a daughter of John Vernon Henry. * Charles DeKay Cooper (1813‚Äì1902), a Reverend who married Cornelia Lansing Sutherland, a granddaughter of Chancellor John Lansing, Jr. Copper died on January 30, 1831.

It can be made from various feedstocks including sugar cane, sugar beet, and wheat grain.Life Cycle Assessment Workbooks for a Selection of Major Renewable Chemicals The final product (polyethylene), whose properties are identical to those of conventional polyethylene, physical properties for conversion into plastics products and also its recycling properties, is extremely versatile in terms of applications and is recyclable in the same chain established for conventional PE. The first plant Ethanol-based chemical pole, totally integrated from sugarcane to polyethylene, was recently announced by The Dow Chemical Company, in conjunction with Crystalsev, a large sugar and ethanol producer in Brazil.Dow and Crystalsev Announce Plans to Make Polyethylene from Sugar Cane in Brazil The pole is said to be projected to produce 770 million pounds per year of renewable LLDPE (linear low-density polyethylene), will begin construction in 2008, and is slated to start production in 2011. The amount of ethanol needed to make one metric ton of polyethylene is roughly two metric tons, as dehydration takes half of the weight in water, from the sugar cane based ethanol, before converting into ethylene (). Braskem is the world leader in the production of biopolymer, with the Green Polyethylene ‚Äì I‚Äôm green ‚Ñ¢, a thermoplastic resin produced from ethylene made from sugarcane ethanol, a 100% renewable raw material which helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The production started in 2010 and is located in Triunfo, South of Brazil. Benefits One of the main environmental benefits of Green PE is the sequestration of roughly 2.15 tons of per ton of Green Polyethylene produced, which comes from the absorbed by the sugar cane while growing, minus the emitted through the production process. Renewable polyethylene is non- biodegradable and can be recycled in the same waste streams as traditional polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) as it is chemically identical. Disadvantages Producing feedstock for biobased plastics relies upon intensive agriculture, potentially contributing to deforestation in order to clear land for agricultural use. Large-scale production of feedstock also requires inputs such as fossil fuels, fertilizers, and pesticides. Production Today Braskem industrial unit has annual production capacity of 200 kton of Green Polyethylene. Green PE has the same properties, performance and application versatility as fossil-based polyethylene, which makes it a drop-in replacement in the plastic production chain. For these same reasons, it is also recyclable in the same recycling chain used by traditional polyethylene. Because it is part of the portfolio of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) products, Green PE rapidly became an option for applications in rigid and flexible packaging, closures, bags and other products. In January 2014, the family of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was added to the product portfolio, effectively covering additional applications in packaging and films.

Tradition states that she was martyred with eighteen companions in 303 AD. She should not be confused with the 8th-century Spanish martyr of the same name. History Although their martyrdom is traditionally placed around 303 during the Diocletianic Persecution, more recently it is considered probable that they died during the persecution of Valerian (254-260). Legend Engratia was a native of Braga who had been promised in marriage to a nobleman of Roussillon. He sent as her escort to Gaul her uncle Lupercius (sometimes identified with the Luperculus who was a bishop of EauzeSabine Baring-Gould, The Lives of the Saints (J. Hodges, 1874), 410.) and a suite of sixteen noblemen and a servant named Julie or Julia. Upon reaching Zaragoza, they learned of the persecution of Christians there by the governor Dacian, who reigned in the time of the emperors Diocletian and Maximian. She attempted to dissuade him from his persecution, but was whipped and imprisoned when it was discovered that she was a Christian. She died of her wounds. Her companions were decapitated. Martyrs of Zaragoza Many others, called the Martyrs of Zaragoza, were martyred at the same time. Also called the Countless Martyrs of Zaragoza, It is said that Dacian, to detect and so make an end of all the faithful of Saragossa, ordered that liberty to practice their religion should be promised them on condition that they all went out of the city at a certain fixed time and by certain designated gates. As soon as they had thus gone forth, he ordered them to be put to the sword and their corpses burned. Their ashes were mixed with those of criminals, so that no veneration might be paid them. But a shower of rain fell and washed the ashes apart, forming those of the martyrs into certain white masses. These, known as the \\"holy masses\\" (las santas masas) were deposited in the crypt of the church dedicated to St. Engratia, where they are still preserved. Their number includes, besides Engratia, Lupercius and Julia: *Caius and Crescentius, confessors rather than martyrs: they were imprisoned and tortured, but did not succumb to their treatment.\\"Santa Engracia\\", Parish of Saint Engracia, Zaragoza *Successus, Martial, Urban, Quintilian, Publius, Fronto, Felix, Cecilian, Evodius, Primitivus, Apodemius, and *four men all sharing the name Saturninus.Santa Engrazia who, according to St. Eugenius II of Toledo would be Jenaro, Casiano, Matutino and Fausto. *Januarius. Veneration Saint Engratia, Bartolom√© Bermejo. Prudentius, a native of Zaragoza, wrote a hymn in honor of these martyrs, and lists their names, and describes the terrible tortures suffered by Encratis (Engratia). An important cult arose around these saints. Engratia was certainly the most venerated of the group, and her cult was diffused throughout Spain and the Pyrenees. Engracia was declared patroness of the city of Saragossa in 1480. During a synod held at Zaragoza in 592, the church dedicated to her there was reconsecrated, an act celebrated on November 3, which sometimes served as an alternate feast day. The Church of Santa Engr√°cia in Lisbon is dedicated to her. The Church of Santa Engracia de Zaragoza was built on the spot where Engratia and her companions were said to have been martyred. It was destroyed in the Spanish War of Independence, with only the crypt and the doorway being left. It was rebuilt in the late 19th or early 20th century, and served as a parish church.

Early life Bates was born in Philadelphia and was the son of William Bates, a classical scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. He briefly attended the William Penn Charter School, and then Phillips Exeter Academy. He attended Harvard University from 1929 to 1935. At Harvard he was a member of the Harvard Mountaineering Club and with Charles Houston, Adams Carter, Bradford Washburn and Terris Moore was part of the group of climbers later known as the \\"Harvard Five\\" who would push forward the standards of American mountaineering in the 1930s. Mount Lucania In 1937 Bates, with Bradford Washburn, made the first ascent of Mount Lucania in Yukon, which was then the highest unclimbed mountain in North America. It was also one of the most remote and inaccessible and had been declared \\"virtually impregnable\\". The pair enlisted the aid of the pilot Robert Reeve to fly them to the mountain, but when they landed on the Walsh Glacier the aeroplane sank into the unexpectedly soft snow. After they had spent five days digging it out Reeve departed, warning Bates and Washburn that he would not be able to return to collect them as planned and that they would have to walk back to civilization. The pair climbed Mount Lucania, and the nearby Mount Steele, and were then faced with a trek through wilderness to Burwash Landing, without maps. They abandoned some of their food to save weight, expecting to restock at a cache left behind by an earlier expedition. However, the cache had been plundered by bears, and Bates and Washburn survived on mushrooms and squirrels during the trek out. Flooded rivers forced them to detour many miles out of their way, and they had eventually walked an estimated 156 miles by the time they reached Burwash Landing, 32 days after arriving on the glacier. The two men lost around twenty pounds each during the walk out. K2 In 1937, Charles Houston invited Bates on an expedition to K2 for 1938, the world's second highest mountain. It was the first expedition to the mountain for nineteen years, and while the focus was on reconnaissance and assessing the feasibility of different routes, Bates was part of a group which reached within 800 m of the summit on the Abruzzi Spur, which would become the preferred route on the mountain.Curran, pp.73-80 Bates and Houston returned to K2 with a new expedition in 1953. The expedition failed due to bad weather and the illness of Art Gilkey, but was widely praised for the courage shown by the team in their unsuccessful attempt to save Gilkey. During the descent, Bates and five other climbers were involved in a near-fatal fall, saved only by the strength of Pete Schoening, who was the last man on the rope.Curran, pp.95-103 Bates later received the David A. Sowles Memorial Award for his part in the attempted rescue. Wartime and after During the Second World War Bates served in the United States Army and was assigned to the Office of the Quartermaster general, where he worked on the development of improved equipment and clothing for the army's mountain divisions. He recruited a skilled wartime team that included mountaineers William P. House, Walter A. Wood III, Bestor Robinson, H. Adams Carter, Terris Moore, Bradford Washburn and Australian arctic explorer Hubert Wilkins. He reached the rank of lieutenant colonel and was awarded a Bronze Star and the Legion of Merit. After the war, Bates taught English at Phillips Exeter Academy. He continued mountaineering throughout his life, and at the age of 74 led an expedition which made the first ascent of Ulugh Muztagh in China. He also spent a year in Kathmandu directing a Peace Corps project, and served as president of the American Alpine Club, which awards the Robert Hicks Bates Award to promising young climbers in his honour. Author Bates was the author of several books. With Charles Houston he wrote accounts of their two K2 expeditions as Five Miles High and K2 - The Savage Mountain; the latter being regarded as a mountaineering classic. He also wrote Mystery, Beauty, and Danger, a study of mountaineering literature, and Mountain Man: The Story of Belmore Brown, the biography of an artist and explorer. His autobiography, The Love of Mountains Is Best, was published in 1994.

He started his career under his real name, and his initial gimmick was that of a fisherman who carried a large flag with a sea-oriented design to the ring. Following the formation of the Italian Connection on March 3, 2002, he was accepted into the unit and renamed Pescatore Yagi, \\"pescatore\\" being the Italian word for fisherman, and he began carrying a large Italian flag to the ring instead. When the ItaCon admitted on January 23, 2003 that they were all indeed Japanese and not Italian, Yagi admitted that he was not a fisherman, but instead the son of a baker. Stable leader Milano Collection A.T. then (kayfabe) banished him to his father's bakery to learn the family trade. He would make his return as Bakery Yagi, costing Crazy MAX a match against the Italian Connection by whacking SUWA in the knee with a baguette. At this point, the Italian Connection was full of internal strife as to whether the stable was to be face or heel. As Bakery, he came down on the heel side. He began carrying loaves of bread to the ring, and using them as weapons in matches. When the ItaCon split, Yagi sided with the heels. Yagi's in-ring career would end as part of the unnamed ItaCon breakaway faction. He, group leader Shuji Kondo, and brother YASSHI were in the ring when Kondo ordered him to the back to get some bread he baked. While he was backstage, Toru Owashi entered the ring. He made the statement that \\"sumos don't eat bread\\", and the three men attacked Yagi, shoving his bread down his throat. =Referee= Yagi returned to Dragon Gate, but as a referee rather than a wrestler. It is presumed that he stepped down because of injury. His first role as a referee was that of a face referee who was continually bothered by the antics of the Florida Brothers. He would eventually join the Floridas, however, as a partial referee. He wore an American flag motif shirt instead of a referee's jersey, and wore oversized celebrity sunglasses, without which he couldn't see. He also performed with the Floridas as the masked Johnson Florida. Even though the Floridas Brothers have ended, he still performs as Johnson on occasion. He and Jackson Florida make up the Florida Express. When the Florida Bros ended, Yagi returned to being the face referee. On a few occasions, he attacked Kinta Tamaoka, the partial heel referee for the Muscle Outlaw'z.

Alabaster carvers were at work in London, York and Burton-on-Trent, and many probably worked very close to the rural mines, but the largest concentration was around Nottingham. This has led to all the English medieval output being referred to as \\"Nottingham alabaster\\". Alabaster is a mineral composed of gypsum and various impurities, is much softer and easier to work than marble and a good material for mass production, though not suitable for outdoors use. Carvings were made as single figures, assemblies for tomb monuments, including full length effigies, but the most common survivals are panels, up to about 20 inches or 50 cm high, from sets for altarpieces, which could be transported relatively easily, and fitted into a locally-made architectural surround of stone or wood on arrival at their destination. These were attractive for less wealthy churches, and for the private chapels of the nobility. Some complete ensembles survive, showing varied numbers of panels; the dimensions of the Nativity illustrated are typical. The subjects were the same as in painted altarpieces, often including short cycles of the Life of Christ, especially the Passion of Christ, or the Life of the Virgin. Since the sets were probably generally not made to a specific commission, unlike paintings, there are fewer local or patron saints. Throughout the period of their production Nottingham alabaster images were hugely popular in Europe and were exported in large quantities, some ending up as far afield as Iceland, Croatia and Poland. But by far the greatest export market for these images was in France, where even today some churches retain in situ their English alabaster altarpieces, unlike England, where survivals are extremely rare. The sculptures were normally brightly painted, sometimes all over, sometimes partially, but much of the paint has often been lost, and many pieces have had the rest completely removed by dealers, collectors or museums in the past. Most alabaster altarpieces and religious carvings other than church monuments remaining in England were destroyed in the English Reformation, after which the many workshops had to change their products to concentrate on church monuments. History Nativity panel, ca 1400, using a composition previously found in French ivories. H. 37.5 cm (14 ¬æ in.), W. 26 cm (10 in.), D. 4.5 cm (1 ¬æ in.) The alabaster used in the industry was quarried largely in the area around South Derbyshire near Tutbury and Chellaston. The craftsmen were known by various names such as alabastermen, kervers, marblers, and image-makers. The tomb of John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall, who died in 1334, in Westminster Abbey, is an early example, of very high quality.V&A; image of their plaster cast On 6 June 1371, payment was made to Peter Maceon of Nottingham, of the balance of 300 marks for a table (altar piece) of alabaster made by him and placed upon the High Altar within the free Chapel of Saint George of Windsor. The execution of this order cost ¬£200 and required 10 carts, 80 horses, and 20 men to transport it to its destination. The journey occupied seventeen days in the autumn of 1367, and the expenses of transport amounted to ¬£30. The church at Tong, Shropshire contains an especially fine sequence of tombs of the Vernon family spanning the 15th and 16th centuries.Jenkins, Simon, England's Thousand Best Churches, pp. 582-583, 1999, Allen Lane, Alabaster religious images in English churches may have survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s, but most did not survive the reign of King Edward VI following the Putting away of Books and Images Act 1549 ordering the destruction of all images. Indeed, eight months after this act, in January 1550 the English Ambassador to France reported the arrival of three English ships laden with alabaster images to be sold at Paris, Rouen and elsewhere. Whether these were new images, or ones removed from English churches, is not entirely clear. From the middle of the sixteenth century, workshops focused instead on sculpting alabaster tombs or church monuments, which were not affected by Protestant aniconism. Indeed, these were becoming larger and more elaborate, and were now taken up by the richer merchant classes as well as the nobility and gentry. Vertical monuments placed against walls generally replaced the older recumbent effigies. There is an elaborate relief panel of Apollo and the Muses, of about 1580, which is probably English, in the Victoria and Albert Museum.Apollo and the Muses, V&A; The industry survived on a smaller scale supplying church monuments, increasingly produced by academically trained sculptors, until the falling price of marble and exhaustion of most English quarries made alabaster increasingly rare as a material for English sculptors by the late 18th century. Spain had the next largest medieval alabaster industry, whose pieces are not always easily distinguished from English work, but pieces were also produced in France, the Low Countries and elsewhere in Europe. Forms detail of the tomb of Sir Ralph Fitzherbert, d. 1483, showing some of his children. The sculpture industry evolved to produce two main forms, panels and statues. Thin panels carved in high relief, typically about 40 cm by 25 cm in size, usually come from series covering the Passion or Life of Christ which were mounted in a wooden framework as altarpieces, or used by the wealthy as domestic devotional works, set in a wooden triptych with closeable doors. The 15th-century Nailloux Altarpiece in south-western France is an example of a five-panel set that remains in situ. Many statues were smaller than this, but there are a number of larger ones. An example of a much larger statue, three feet high and free-standing but flat-backed, is Our Lady of Westminster, now in London but found by the art trade in France. The discovery in 1863 of a headless but stylistically almost identical alabaster image, buried in the churchyard of All Saints, Broughton, Craven, suggests that, as was apparently usually the case, the statue was a standard model repeated several times by the workshop, and probably produced for stock rather than upon receipt of a particular commission. Exports, as of the better documented contemporary export trade in icons of the Cretan school, were usually made in bulk for sale to dealers, who then found buyers locally. Monument to Edmund Brudenell, d.1590. After the English Reformation tomb monuments were the mainstay of the industry. Most surviving examples have lost much of their paintwork, but the colouring of the carvings was an integral part of the production. Colouring was usually very vivid, with robes being painted in scarlets and blues, hair and accoutrements such as crowns and sceptres were often gilded, and landscapes were decorated with distinctive daisy patterns often against a dark-green ground. Moulded and gilded gesso was also used to give extra richness to the carvings which would need to be brightly coloured, as mostly they would only be seen at a distance by candlelight. The subjects of the sculptors were the usual content of altarpieces, most often scenes from the Life of Christ or Life of the Virgin. There is a subject apparently unique to English alabasters, the Bosom of Abraham Trinity, a variant of the Throne of Mercy which is more often found, and with the Madonna and Child, is often a larger free-standing statue ‚Äì such as the Westminster example. Other subjects include saint's lives, including Thomas Becket and, exceptionally, the V&A; has a fine detached head of John the Baptist,V&A; Head of John the Baptist the subject of a popular devotional cult from the second half of the 15th century right up to the Reformation, which involved fasting on Wednesdays to obtain specific graces. =Bosom of Abraham Trinities= A rare iconography apparently unique to English alabaster is the \\"Bosom of Abraham Trinity\\", where in a composition of the \\"Throne of Mercy\\" type, a group of tiny figures are seen in a napkin held or supported between the hands of God the Father.Nigel Ramsay in: Jonathan Alexander & Paul Binski (eds), Age of Chivalry, Art in Plantagenet England, 1200‚Äì1400, p. 514-515, Royal Academy/Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1987 There are five examples of free-standing statues known, in the Burrell Collection Museum in Glasgow, the Museum of Fine Arts, BostonRamsey op cit; Boston image and elsewhere, and nine panels. The theme combines elements of the Western Virgin of Mercy and the Russian Pokrov icons, though these are not necessarily direct influences, and was probably associated with the dedication of All Saints. =Scenes from the life of Thomas Beckett= There are panels showing scenes from the life of Thomas Beckett: *The consecration of Thomas Becket as Archbishop *St. Thomas meeting the Pope at Sens in 1164 *St. Thomas landing at Sandwich *The Martyrdom of St. Thomas Image:StThomasEnthroned.jpgSt Thomas Becket enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury from a Nottingham alabaster in the Victoria & Albert Museum Image:StThomasSens.jpgSt. Thomas meeting the Pope at Sens Image:StThomasReturn.jpgSt Thomas Becket returns from exile in France from a 15th-century Nottingham Alabaster in the Victoria & Albert Museum Image:Britmusbecketalabaster.jpgThe Martyrdom of St. Thomas from the British Museum Image:Martyrdom of Thomas Becket.jpgThe Martyrdom of St. Thomas =Other panels and statues= File:England Crucifixion.jpgPolychromed Crucifixion, English late 15th century, National Museum in Warsaw File:TrinityBosomAbraham.jpgBosom of Abraham Trinity, a Throne of Mercy with the souls of the saved in a napkin, English late 15th century, V & A.

Work is still to be found in churches and museums across Europe, and appears in such far flung locations as Croatia, Iceland and Poland. The Victoria and Albert Museum and Nottingham Castle Museum hold the two principal collections of Nottingham Alabaster in the United Kingdom. The collection in Nottingham includes three alabaster figures, representing The Virgin Mary, St. Peter, and a bishop. They were discovered on the site of St. Peter's Church, Flawford, in 1779. There is a very large single frame piece of the Coronation of the Virgin in the Barber Institute in Birmingham. Some pieces, such as the Nailloux Altarpiece remain in situ in continental churches. There are complete altarpieces with a series of scenes in the museum of the Cathedral in Santiago de Compostela, and in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples. An exceptionally large Virgin & Child (36 in high) known as Our Lady of Westminster, sculpted circa 1450 in Nottingham and exported from there to France, can be found in the Lady Chapel of Westminster Cathedral, London, whence it was installed after being bought at the Paris Exhibition of 1954.

It is equipped with the KC-135R Stratotanker. History =World War II= Trained with V-72 Vengeance aircraft. Moved to India, via Australia, July‚ÄìSeptember 1943. Assigned to Tenth Air Force. Operating from India and using A-36A Apaches. The 528th Fighter Squadron having its markings as black reverse diagonal bands painted on a yellowtail. The red nose was also a squadron marking. Many planes of the squadron had a girl's name on the nose but very few had any artwork. The squadron supported Allied ground forces in northern Burma; covered bombers that attacked Rangoon, Insein, and other targets; bombed enemy airfields at Myitkyina and Bhamo; and conducted patrol and reconnaissance missions to help protect transport planes that flew The Hump route between India and China. Converted to P-51C Mustangs in May 1944. Moved to Burma in July and continued to support ground forces, including Merrill's Marauders; also flew numerous sweeps over enemy airfields in central and southern Burma. Moved to China in August 1944 and assigned to Fourteenth Air Force. Escorted bombers, flew interception missions, struck the enemy's communications, and supported ground operations, serving in combat until the end of the war. Ferried P-51's from India for the Chinese Air Force in November 1945. Returned to the US in December 1945. Inactivated in early 1946. =Maine Air National Guard= The wartime 528th Fighter Squadron was redesignated as the 132nd Fighter Squadron and was allotted to the Maine Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Dow Field, Bangor, Maine, and was extended federal recognition on 4 February 1947. The 132nd was equipped with F-47D Thunderbolts and was initially assigned to the Massachusetts ANG 67th Fighter Wing. It was later assigned to the Maine ANG 101st Fighter Group on 4 April 1947 after the Maine ANG group was recognized and activated. Air defense mission 132nd Fighter Squadron ‚Äì Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star 48‚Äì891, 1950 The 132nd replaced their F-47 Thunderbolts with jet Lockheed F-80C Shooting Stars in the summer of 1948 and were redesignated with the \\"Jet\\" suffix on 1 August. With the surprise invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950 and the regular military's lack of readiness, most of the Air National Guard was called active duty. The 132nd was federalized on 10 February 1951 and redesignated as the 132nd Fighter-Interceptor Squadron as was its parent, which became the 101st Fighter-Interceptor Group.Cornett & Johnson. p. 74 The group remained assigned to the group, however it was attached first to the 101st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, then to the 23rd Fighter-Interceptor Wing. On 6 February 1952, the 132nd was transferred to the 4711th Defense Wing, which replaced the 23rd wing at Presque Isle Air Force Base.Cornett & Johnson, pp. 61, 67 With the end of its federalization period, the squadron's mission, personnel, and F-80C jets were transferred to the active-duty 49th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 1 November 1952. The squadron was released from active duty and returned to the control of the State of Maine. North American F-51H Mustang 44-64368, 1953 F-101B Voodo 58-0293, 1974 Upon its return to Maine control, the 132nd was re-equipped with F-51H Mustang prop-interceptors, however, in 1954, the squadron would return to jet interceptors, the F-94A Starfire. The air defense mission for the Maine Air National Guard continued for the next twenty years, the squadron upgrading its aircraft every few years as more modern interceptors were passed down from Air Defense Command as they were replaced by new active-duty aircraft. The ADC radar detection stations at Brunswick, Bucks Harbor, Caswell, Charleston, and Topsham were ready to make detection and calls for a scramble. Within three minutes the 13sd could be airborne and heading for a prospective rendezvous point. After identifying any intruders, the interceptor aircraft were supposed to radio back to the Ground Control Interceptor (GCI) station for further instructions. Beginning in 1955, the squadron stood 24/7/365 runway alert at Dow AFB ready to respond to aircraft not readily identifiable by radar or pre- filed flight plans. In 1968 Dow Air Force Base was closed as a result of Air Force-wide downsizing directed by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. The closure was in part directed due to the desire by McNamara to reduce the size of the Air Force B-52 Stratofortress fleet, the increasing cost of the Vietnam War and the change to Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBMs) as the primary strategic deterrence force. With the inactivation of Dow AFB in 1968, most of the base was purchased by the city of Bangor and reopened the following year as Bangor International Airport. That portion of Dow AFB was not turned over to the city became the basis for the current Air National Guard Base and the Maine Army National Guard's Army Aviation Support Facility. In November 1969, the 132nd FIS became one of the first Air National Guard squadrons to operate the F-101B Voodoo.Francillion, Rene J, (1990) McDonnell Douglas Aircraft: Since 1920 , Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, p. 155 Air refueling On 1 July 1976, the 101st was relieved from Aerospace Defense Command and transferred to Strategic Air Command (SAC), becoming a KC-135A Stratotanker unit. This was part of the downsizing of ADCOM, with the probability of an air attack by Soviet bombers and fighters being remote in the age of the ICBM. The 101st was re-designated as an Air Refueling Wing, the 132nd an Air Refueling Squadron. 132nd AREFS KC-135A 57-1491 about 1980 in SAC markings In 1977, the 132nd deployed to RAF Mildenhall, England, as part of the European Tanker Task Force. In 1978, it began to stand alert with the SAC active force. In October 1978 The 101st AFREW along with all other Air Guard Units underwent reorganization into the Dual Deputy organization structure; the 101st Air Refueling Group being inactivated on 30 September. In August 1979, the 101st became the first Air National Guard unit to host a tanker task force, and during the fall, the 101st joined forces with 16 KC-135A's providing air refueling support for \\"Crested Cap\\". This airpower exercise tested the deployment capability of Air Force fighter aircraft moving from the U.S. to Europe in support of NATO war efforts there. During the 1980s, the 101st continued to participate in Strategic Air Command exercises like Global Shield and Giant Voice. In 1984, the 101st converted from its aging KC-135A fleet with the new fue-efficient KC-135Es and the receipt of its first Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The wing engaged in routine worldwide deployments with its KC-135s. = 1990/1991 Gulf Crisis= Early on the morning of 7 August 1990, Operation Desert Shield, a build-up of friendly forces designed to contain the spread of Iraqi aggression, began. A telephone alert asked every crew member of the 132nd Air Refueling Squadron to provide maximum availability so that an immediate response capability could be developed. All 125 Operations crew members stepped forward in voluntary support. The unit began functioning on a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week basis. Numerous Desert Shield missions would be flown in the month of August as the 132nd helped refuel transport aircraft and fighters heading to the United States Air Forces Central (CENTAF) bases in the Middle East. Volunteers were placed on full active duty status for as long as needed. Close to 100 guard members reported during the next few days as additional KC-135s arrived TDY from other ANG units, together with the 132nd's own KC-135E aircraft forming an Air National Guard tanker task force. By 1 October, the 101st's heavy support of MAC flights in transit from the West Coast to bases in Saudi Arabia began to slow. The 101st ARW became one of 12 National Guard units tasked with providing refueling support to Air Force units deployed to Saudi Arabia. On 12 October the 101st began deployment of its assets to Saudi Arabia to form the 1709th Air Refueling Wing (Provisional) at King Abdul Aziz Air Base, Jeddah. Personnel and aircraft, however, were dispersed at several locations in the Middle East, including Al Banteen Air Base, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Mor√≥n Air Base, Spain; Cairo West Airport, Egypt; and other locations. By January 1991, the build-up of men and material in-theater was complete. Operation Desert Storm, the attack phase of the Allied plan to liberate Kuwait and destroy Iraq's army, was ready to begin. With its strategic location on the Atlantic shore, the 101st mission reverted to an \\"Air-Bridge\\" mode, refueling transiting aircraft heading across the Atlantic or inbound from RAF Mildenhall, England, which served on the other end of the transatlantic route to the Middle East. After a short 100 hours of ground combat, Iraq's elite Republican Guard quickly collapsed and Kuwait was easily recaptured by Coalition ground forces. Emotional returns, punctuated by parades, bands, speeches, tears, and bear-hugs were commonplace in New Hampshire as they were throughout the country. Many deployed units returning from CENTAF bases stopped at Bangor AGB on their way to their home bases. The 101st, its aircraft festooned with yellow ribbons painted above the boom, remained in \\"air-bridge\\" mode, supporting the returning traffic. By late April almost everyone had come home safely. There had been no casualties. = Modern era= 101st ARW KC-135Es at Pisa Airport, Italy, 1996 In March 1992, with the end of the Cold War, the 101st adopted the Air Force Objective Organization plan. The Tri-Deputy organizational structure was revised with the 101st Operations Group, 101st Maintenance Group, 101st Mission Support Group and the 101st Medical Group being formed and the 132nd Air Refueling Squadron being assigned to the 101st Operations Group. On 30 June, Strategic Air Command was inactivated as part of the Air Force reorganization after the end of the Cold War. It was replaced by Air Combat Command (ACC). In 1993, ACC transferred its KC-135 tanker force to the new Air Mobility Command (AMC). The unit engaged in routine deployments and training until 1994 when the 101st began operating in the Northeast Tanker Task Force together with the New Hampshire Air National Guard. The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and \\"Operation Deny Flight\\" continued to involve 101st aircraft, crews, and support personnel. In 2001, with the advent of the Global War on Terrorism, Maine ANG KC-135s were used for air refueling aircraft flying Combat Air Patrols over major United States Cities as part of Operation Noble Eagle (ONE). 132nd ARS aircraft were deployed to Air Forces Central (AFCENT) in the middle east as Air Expeditionary Units, providing refueling for combat aircraft during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan. In 2007, the 132nd's KC-135E-model aircraft were replaced throughout the summer with quieter, more efficient R-models. With their new CFM-56 engines, a 50 percent decrease in noise resulted, and emissions were reduced 90 percent, while range, fuel off-load capability, and reliability were all increased.

Beginning his career in the military, Kang entered politics through the diplomatic foreign ministry before being elected to the National Assembly in 1987. He was appointed prime minister a year later in President Roh Tae-woo's first cabinet reshuffle. His two-year tenure as prime minister was marked by his rapprochement towards North Korea, under Roh's Nordpolitik policy. After leaving government, Kang went on to become President of the South Korean National Red Cross from 1991 to 1997. Early life and education Kang was born in Changsong County, North Pyongan Province when Korea was under Japanese rule in 1922. He joined the National Defense Forces, a precursor to the Republic of Korea Army, shortly after his graduation from the Kenkoku University towards the end of World War II. He served as a division commander during the Korean War and a military attach√© in the Embassy of South Korea, Washington, D.C. in 1952 before becoming Director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Ministry of National Defense in 1954. After a brief spell in the United States at the Army Command and General Staff College, Kang eventually reached the rank of Chungjang (Lieutenant General) and ended his career as the Superintendent of the Korean Military Academy in 1961, the same year as a bloodless military coup that he opposed.Susan Chira, Seoul Leader Shuffles Cabinet, The New York Times, 5 December 1988, Retrieved 31 March 2008. He was detained in Seodaemun Prison for his role against the coup. On his release from prison, Kang headed back to America, gaining a M.A. in International Relations (1966) and a Ph.D. in Political Science (1973) from the University of Southern California.Steering Committee: Young-Hoon Kang , USC Asia Conference 2004, Retrieved 31 March 2008. During his doctorate studies, he founded the Research Institute on Korean Affairs in Silver Spring, Maryland. Political career Kang returned to South Korea in 1976, taking up the post of graduate school dean at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. His first foray into politics occurred in 1978 when he was appointed head of the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, the training institute of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He then served as the Ambassador to the United Kingdom and Ireland (1981-84), and the Vatican (1984-87). After the pro-democracy protests of 1987, Kang ran for election and was elected to the 13th National Assembly as a member of the ruling Democratic Justice Party. Prime Minister Kang was appointed Prime Minister by President Roh Tae-woo, who at the same time replaced 19 of 23 Cabinet members in a major shake up meant to separate himself from his disgraced predecessor, President Chun Doo-hwan. Kang was chosen, in part, because of his opposition to the Park Chung-hee-led coup of 1961. A moderate, Kang supported the democratic transition between the previous military regimes and civilian rule. During his tenure, political violence continued at universities throughout South Korea as groups labeled by the regime as \\"leftist radicals\\" advocated for the overthrow of the Government.6 Korea Police Die In Raid On Campus, Associated Press, 3 May 1989, Retrieved 31 March 2008.David E.

Despite a lack of mutual agreement on substantive issues, the two sides agreed to another round of talks in Seoul from 11‚Äì14 December.

Biography Born in Piacenza, Poggi studied first in Bologna with soprano Valeria Manna, and later in Milan with baritone Emilio Ghirardini. He made his debut in Palermo, as Rodolfo, in 1947. He first sang at La Scala in 1948 and appeared there until 1965, his roles included: Riccardo, Enzo, Fernando, Edgardo, Duca di Mantua, Alfredo, Cavaradossi, etc. He also sang at all the major opera houses throughout Italy, notably in Florence in 1955, in a revival of Donizetti's Dom Sebastien. He portrayed the role of Lohengrin at Arena of Verona in 1949 and in his home town Piacenza in 1963 (both sung in Italian). Poggi made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1955, in Rigoletto, opposite Robert Merrill and Roberta Peters. He returned for further performances in 1957: Rigoletto again (now with Leonard Warren), Tosca (opposite Antonietta Stella and Walter Cassel, conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos), La boh√®me (with Licia Albanese and Ettore Bastianini, conducted by Thomas Schippers), Lucia di Lammermoor (with Lily Pons), La traviata (opposite Renata Tebaldi), and La Gioconda (with Zinka Milanov, Leonard Warren, Cesare Siepi and Regina Resnik).

He defeated Haji Sir Abdullah Haroon in 1937 in the first election after Sindh was separated from Bombay. He was also twice elected the Mayor of the then Karachi Municipal Corporation in 1951 and 1961. It is now the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation. . Due to his outstanding status, he was awarded the title of Khan Bahadur by the British Empire and after the independence of Pakistan in 1947, he was awarded the Sitara i Imtiaz by President Ayub Khan in 1966. Thus he was considered to be an influential politician of Karachi of his times. Baloch League Karachi is not only the cradle of the modern Balochi literary movement, but also the centre to uphold the modern Baloch political trends. Simultaneous with formation of the Anjuman, the Baloch literary class in Karachi formed a nationalist organisation, called the Baloch League. Gholam Mohammad Noor ud-Din, educated from Bombay, was appointed as its president. The other members of its leadership were: Waja Omar Bakhsh Sabera, a famous merchant, Maolavi Mohammad Osman, Mehrab Khan, Issa Khan, Maolavi Abdul Samad Sarbazi, Khan Sahib Osman, Pir Bakhsh Shahdad and Gabol. In its annual conference in 1930 the League condemned Magasi's imprisonment and openly demanded his immediate release from the British authorities. In the late 1930s, after his graduation from Aligarh University, the nationalist leader, Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo also joined the League.

The Coalition comprises social movements, community-based organizations, support groups and academics. The strength of the Coalition is based on its worldwide membership (it has members in 117 nations in five continents) and on the fact that it brings together a range of civil society groups. Dedicated to advocacy and support for the poor, solidarity networking, popular mobilization, debate and analysis, HIC works to unite civil society in a shared commitment to ensuring sustainable habitat and a livable planet for all. Its work focuses on defending and implementing the human rights linked to housing and habitat; i.e., land, housing, clean water, sanitation, a healthy environment, access to public goods and services (e.g., health, education, transport and recreation; access to livelihood and social protection, pluralism and the preservation of social, natural, historic and cultural patrimony. Since the ‚Äô80 HIC has been developing special capacities seeking gender equality, in a balanced articulation between reflection and action on different issues: the rights‚Äô approach, the right to the city, the social production of habitat, women and habitat and the sustainable habitat. HIC specific work on the right to the city seeks to deepen the analysis and the actions on the proposal of building more just cities worldwide. HIC has been committed since decades in the creation of a theoretical and practical framework for the right to the city. The Coalition articulates and accompanies social movements and organizations in their struggle to achieve the realization of all human rights to ensure the collective well-being of inhabitants; the democratic management and the social function of the city. HIC is also aware of the global challenges facing worldwide on climate change and food sovereignty and the obvious impacts on the cities: the Coalition works on broaden exchanges between urban and rural movements. HIC‚ÄôS work on social production of habitat seeks to derive practical lessons from the compilation, exchange and analysis of ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs processes‚Äù in initiating, designing, building and maintaining local environments. These experiences, which build upon local social resources and demonstrate local social reliance and ingenuity, generate and promote methods and strategies that then can be shared and replicated across regions. Each region has given rise to diverse and specific examples of struggles and efforts that emphasize distinct circumstances and priorities to construct people-centred livelihoods. In order to strengthen people's process for access and provision of land and shelter, lessons learned to date show a need to: * understand what sustains the people‚Äôs process on land, housing and habitat/settlements development, in urban and rural areas, * understand what are the forces, both external and internal, that strengthen or weaken peoples‚Äô processes, including political and economic forces that have a bearing on people's processes, and in particular the dynamics of the informal and formal land markets; * envision alternative ways to develop cities and other human settlements, evolving a bottom-up perspective on human settlement development without destroying livelihoods, assets and material achievements of the poor, while, quite to the contrary, supporting and nurturing livelihoods, assets and settlements of the poor, and their integration into the city; * articulate and support the people‚Äôs processes through policies and actions for both government and nongovernmental organizations; * develop more flexible design-based, knowledge-based and service-based housing policies and outputs with the objective of realizing the human right to adequate housing and equitable land use.  History  The beginnings of the Habitat International Coalition refer to the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements in Vancouver in 1976. In this conference a committee was created and was further elaborated in the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972 and other global UN conferences. In 1976 the committee concluded and supported the necessity for there to be a constant NGO pressure on governments and international agencies to follow up their recommendations. Also in 1976, the UN Centre for Human Settlements (UN Habitat) was created and therefore the committee sought to create an organization that represented the NGO interests in this sphere named Habitat International Council. Initially HIC was made up of primarily of organizations from the North. In 1985 it was able to widen its membership to include global representation through a project that sought to document innovative ways to work with low-income groups and community organizations to improve housing conditions and the different ways that they pressured governments to resolve housing needs. As part of the preparations for the UN International Year of Shelter for the Homeless in 1987, HIC members organized a conference in Limuru, Kenya that brought together representatives from over 40 NGOs from Africa, Asia and Latin America as well as many international NGOs. The discussions that took place therein gave way to a new HIC structure, culminating in a clear vision to fight for everyone's right to a secure place to live in peace and dignity.

He is a guitarist, and is known for incisive, literate songwriting. He is also noted for his music loop work, often creating spontaneous compositions in performance. He is the co-author of the book Playing in the Band: An Oral and Visual Portrait of the Grateful Dead, and the host of the weekly syndicated radio show The Grateful Dead Hour. He currently co-hosts a radio show with Gary Lambert on Sirius XM's The Grateful Dead Channel called Tales from the Golden Road, a call-in show about the Grateful Dead. Biography =Journalism= Born in Los Angeles, California, Gans started out as a musician in 1970, playing guitar and writing songs and performing both as a soloist and as a member of various bands around the San Francisco Bay Area. Then, in an unusual career change, he became a music journalist. Gans' journalism career was quite successful, writing for BAM, a free San Francisco-based magazine, and Jann Wenner's Record from its beginning to its end, and working as music editor of Mix magazine for a while. He wrote articles for prominent magazines such as Relix and Rolling Stone. He commented, \\"Writing for music magazines gave me access to musicians and producers and record company publicists. I got a million-dollar education from interviewing Leo Fender, Randy Newman, Fleetwood Mac, Steve Goodman, T Bone Burnett, Warren Zevon, Ted Templeman, and people like that. I spent time in recording studios, learned how the music business operates, rode in limos with the Doobie Brothers, got lots of records for free, and got paid for all of it.\\" In 1985, his first book, Playing in the Band: an Oral and Visual Portrait of the Grateful Dead (co-authored with Peter Simon) about his long-time favorites, the Grateful Dead, was published to critical acclaim. Nicholas Meriweather noted that \\"Playing in the Band introduced thousands of fans to the deeper history of the band and scene, at a time when good books on the band were a rarity\\"http://www.dead.net/features/blog/documenting-dead-david- gans-collection-0 Four of Mr. Gans' photos appear in the book Eyes of the World (Jay Blakesberg-Josh Baron), published in 2017. =Broadcast= While promoting his first book on the Grateful Dead, \\"Playing in the Band\\", Gans found himself in the studios of KFOG radio in San Francisco. He soon found himself producing pieces for the station, which led to his being offered the opportunity to host \\"The Grateful Dead Hour.\\"http://liveforlivemusic.com/features/tales-from-david-gans-profiling- the-musician-and-grateful-dead-expert/, originally titled \\"The Deadhead Hour\\" https://www.gratefulweb.com/articles/grateful-dead-hour-celebrate-twenty- years. The program was syndicated on dozens of stations across the United States. Gans has added Tales from the Golden Road on Sirius/XM Satellite Radio with co-host Gary Lambert, editor of The Grateful Dead Almanac; and the local weekly show, Dead to the World, on Berkeley's KPFA to his oeuvre of media work. Gans is credited by many for encouraging Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh to emerge from retirement. Lesh played several shows with David Gans and the Broken Angels in late 1997 and early 1998. Gans assembled interesting combinations of musicians for Lesh to jam with in a series of benefits for Lesh's Unbroken Chain Foundation, culminating with a sold-out show at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco on January 31, 1998. Shortly after that event, Lesh began assembling ensembles of his own and touring as Phil Lesh and Friends. =Music= Gans describes his career in musical journalism as \\"getting 'sidetracked' from his first love: actually making music. In the mid-1990s, with the death of Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead's subsequent extended hiatus, Gans decided to set journalism on the back-burner and focus on music again. In 1997 he released a duet album of himself playing with Berkeley singer-songwriter Eric Rawlins, Home By Morning, backing it up by performing around the Bay Area. This was followed the next year by a topical single, \\"Monica Lewinsky,\\" that got a lot of airplay and publicity and enabled Gans to expand his touring base. After more than twenty years of performing in the San Francisco Bay Area as a solo singer-songwriter and with various bands (The Reptiles, Crazy Fingers, David Gans and the Broken Angels), Gans began touring nationally, which he continues to do today. He performs at many festivals including the Gathering of the Vibes, the High Sierra Music Festival, MagnoliaFest and the Suwannee SpringFest (both held annually at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park), Grateful Fest (in Nelson Ledges Quarry Park, Ohio), the Master Musicians Festival (in Somerset, Kentucky); the Terrapin Hill Music Festival (in Harrodsburg, Kentucky), Hookahville (in Ohio), the Sunshine Daydream Music Festival (in Terra Alta, West Virginia), the Berkeley (California) Free Folk Festival, and others. He has appeared in concert all over the country, from Seattle to Atlanta, Burlington to Phoenix. In 2002, Gans became one of the first independent musicians to release a DVD. Live at the Powerhouse documents a stirring outdoor afternoon performance at a northern California brewpub, featuring some of his best material and demonstrating his work multi-tracking himself live, using a Boss RC-20 Loop Station. He has performed onstage with members of the Grateful Dead, The Schwag, JGB, the New Riders of the Purple Sage, Donna the Buffalo, Peter Rowan, Ollabelle, The Waybacks, Blueground Undergrass, Dark Star Orchestra, Keller Williams, moe., Hot Buttered Rum, the Rowan Brothers, and Henry Kaiser. Gans' most recent musical endeavor is the Sycamore Slough String Band, an acoustic band playing the music of the Grateful Dead. The band features a variety of special guest from the Grateful Dead family of musicians including Mark Karan, Jason Crosby, Henry Kaiser, James Nash and Sunshine Becker. The band is currently performing live throughout Northern California and touring the East Coast. The Dead Vault's own Cosmic Charlie recently said about Sycamore Slough's performance of \\"Loser\\", \\"There's some phenomenal vocal harmonies here, and Gans sounds great on the lead vocal. There's some really great melodic guitar work by Gans here too!

She joined KOMO in June 1980, after the eruption of Mount St. Helens and did many special newscasts thereafter, including the fall of the Berlin Wall (she was the first local American TV news reporter to do so). Before KOMO Kathi Goertzen was born in Seattle on April 30, 1958. She graduated from Queen Anne High School and had initially set out to be a veterinarian. However, she changed her career goals after witnessing a dog necropsy, and then aspired to become a journalist, enrolling at Washington State University. Kathi Goertzen graduated in 1980 from WSU with a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications from the Edward R. Murrow School of Communication. She was a member of the Omega chapter of Alpha Chi Omega sorority, and served as an anchor/reporter for the student-produced newscast at KWSU-TV. She also interned as a beat reporter at KREM-TV in Spokane. Career with KOMO After joining KOMO-TV in 1980, she became a regular reporter. After one year, in 1981, she became a general assignment reporter, then in 1982, she took weekend news anchoring duties from anchor Kerry Brock. In 1984, she became co-anchor for the weeknight editions of KOMO 4 News with Jim Harriott. When the Berlin Wall fell, Goertzen was the first local American news reporter to report live from the scene at Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin. In 2005, Goertzen and co-anchor Dan Lewis became the longest-running network affiliate news team in the United States west of the Mississippi River. =Absences from KOMO= In 1989, she took a three-month maternity leave upon the birth of her first daughter, Alexa, and another maternity leave again in 1995 after her second daughter, Andrea, was born. On December 1, 1998, KOMO announced that Goertzen had been suffering from a type of meningioma, a noncancerous tumor that grows on the brain stem that affects speech and the ability to swallow. The announcement led to many longtime KOMO viewers pouring out support, wishing for a speedy recovery.KOMO's Goertzen cuts back anchor duties Seattle Post-Intelligencer, November 29, 2003. Retrieved on March 31, 2008. Treatment went quickly for the first occurrence, and she returned to KOMO News on January 3, 1999.Kathi Goertzen goes back to late nights on KOMO/4 Seattle Post-Intelligencer, December 9, 2006. Retrieved on March 31, 2008. When she returned to the program, her co-anchor, Dan Lewis, said, \\"Kathi, don't ever leave me like that again.\\" The tumor recurred in 2005, resulting in Goertzen announcing a leave of absence on September 16. Because the tumor was located near nerves that are vital to speech, it could not be removed completely, it had regrown to where Goertzen announced on April 2, 2008 that she would be undergoing a third surgery to remove the tumor. The surgery \\"went better than expected\\" on April 3, and after spending several months on an experimental chemotherapy drug used to fight kidney cancer (with high levels of success), it was announced on August 14 that Goertzen would resume anchor duties alongside Dan Lewis on September 2, 2008. A little more than two weeks following her return on KOMO 4 News, on September 18, Kathi Goertzen announced that the tumor had grown back yet again, and that she would undergo her fourth operation to have the tumor removed. Her announcement topped all the evening newscasts, with longtime news anchor Dan Lewis leading the 11 PM newscast. After a number of surgeries to remove the tumor, and five months off television, Goertzen returned to KOMO-TV on Monday, February 16, 2009. The surgeries had partially paralyzed the right side of her face, resulting in difficulty blinking her right eye. As a result of her surgeries, she wore glasses off air; in her 29-year history with KOMO- TV, she had never worn them on-air. Her return to broadcasting the evening news was met with scores of \\"Welcome back, Kathi!\\" remarks by fellow KOMO colleagues and KOMO viewers. On February 2, 2011, Goertzen again underwent surgery to remove parts of the tumor that continued to grow. The various treatments had damaged her facial nerve, which partially debilitated one side of her face. In surgery for more than 10 hours her doctors reported that they were going to be more aggressive this time and remove all the tumor. Her doctors had hoped that this would be the last time Kathi would be undergoing surgery. The creation of a support page on Facebook for Kathi had amassed over 72,000 fans as of July 29, 2012. On January 26, 2012, Kathi posted on her Facebook page: \\"Doctor saw some tumor growth so wants to do surgery...again! Will keep you posted when. Really appreciate your good thoughts and prayers. As one of my FB friends wrote, \\"There's no room for fear and faith in this house!\\" Dread, maybe. :)\\" Community involvement Kathi Goertzen served on the WSU Foundation Board of Trustees from 1994 to 2000. She was also a Board Member of the YWCA of Seattle-King County. Personal life Goertzen married Rick Jewett, a KOMO-TV account executive (formerly a sales executive, and previously a KOMO photographer), in 1993. Goertzen had two daughters, Alexa and Andrea. Death Kathi Goertzen died on August 13, 2012, of pneumonia, a complication of her long battle with recurring meningiomas.

He now is the managing director of Liqui Moly, together with G√ºnter Hiermaier. Founding Liqui Moly GmbH was founded in 1957 in Ulm on the river Danube. The patent for production of molybdenum disulfide formed the basis for the company. This additive based on liquified molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) was the company's first product and gave the company its name. Molybdenum sulfide, the basic ingredient of the Liqui Moly Oil additive, was discovered in the shops of the US Army in post-war Germany. These shops sold a can under the brand name Liqui Moly that contained the liquified form of the solid lubricant molybdenum sulfide (MoS2). When added to motor oil, this substance ensures emergency running characteristics in the event of a sudden loss of oil. Fighter pilots in World War One had already exploited this property, adding MoS2 to the motor oil in the aircraft engines. This enabled pilots to still land, even if the oil tank was hit. Products Liqui Moly's main product is motor oil with MoS2 but there are also other lubricants with MoS2 and the additive MoS2 itself to be added by the end user during oil changes. Molybdenum disulfide enhances the lubrication quality of the oil and offers emergency operating features under harsh conditions. It can be added to motor oils and to non-motor oils including gear oil, transmission oil or differentials oils. From this additive, an entire range was developed, with over 4000 products including engine and gear oils, additives and vehicle care products, workshop equipment and service products.MOLY - Company information -.

Image of Funda√ß√£o Centro Brasileiro de TV Educativa. Jongo, also known as caxambu or tabu, is a dance and musical genre of black communities from southeast Brazil. It originated from the dances performed by slaves who worked at coffee plantations in the Para√≠ba Valley, between Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo, and also at farms in some areas of Minas Gerais and Esp√≠rito Santo. Jongo is a member of a larger group of Afro-Brazilian dances, such as batuque, tambor de crioula, and zamb√™, which feature many elements in common, including the use of fire-tuned drums, the call-and-response form of group singing, the poetical language used in the songs, and the umbigada, a distinctive step whereby two dancers hit their bellies . Jongos usually take place during a nightlong party in which several people dance in pairs or in a circle, to the sound of two or more drums, while a soloist sings short phrases answered by the group. The drums, built from hollow tree trunks covered with animal hide in one of the extremities and tuned by the heat of a bonfire, are called caxambu or tambu (the bigger one) and candongueiro (the smaller one). Other instruments can also be used, such as a large and low-pitched friction drum, called pu√≠ta or angoma-pu√≠ta, and a rattle made of straw and small beads, called guai√°, inguai√°, or ang√≥ia. Jongo songs, also called pontos, are sung in Portuguese but may include words of African origin. Often improvised, they are of several types, each one with a particular function: the pontos de louva√ß√£o are used to salute spiritual entities, the owners of the house and the ancestors; the pontos de visaria or bizarria are sung for fun purposes, to enliven the dancers or as a vehicle for satirical commentaries; the pontos de demanda, porfia, or gurumenta are used by singers who challenge each On the coffee plantations during the nineteenth century, jongos occupied an intermediate position between religious ceremony and secular diversion. Performed on weekends or on the eve of holidays, they were often the only form of entertainment available to the slaves, and also the only opportunity to perform forbidden African religious rites, even if disguised as profane dances. The use of African terms, combined with a rich metaphorical language, made jongo songs obscure to the white masters, thus providing a means for the expression of social criticism and cryptic messages from one slave to the others. Though in the twentieth century jongo became essentially a profane diversion, it never lost completely its religious aspects, and is closely related to umbanda, a syncretic religion mixing African, Catholic, and spiritist beliefs born in the first decades of the twentieth century. Jongo and umbanda share a common cosmology, and many jongueiros are devout umbandistas. Today, jongos continue to be performed by descendants of slaves in a least a dozen communities, in rural settings as well as in the periphery of cities. Since the 1990s jongo has experienced a revival and become more widely known as a hallmark of Afro-Brazilian culture. Sources *Carneiro, Edison. ‚ÄúSamba de umbigada.‚Äù In: Folguedos Tradicionais.

It is a mixed school with around one thousand children on roll for ages 11‚Äì16. It is situated just east of Emerson Park, between Hornchurch and Upminster. It is on the London Outer Orbital Path - the London LOOP Section 22, and just west of the River Ingrebourne. History =Grammar School= The school was established in 1943 during World War II as Hornchurch County High School, and opened with 75 boys and girls and a staff of 4 teachers on Cedar Avenue in Upminster (now the site of Branfil Primary School). By 1952 there were 294 students and it was clear that larger premises were needed. A new school was built after the war on farmlands extending from Wych Elm Road down to the River Ingrebourne, providing a large playing field area. The school was opened in September 1954, renamed Hornchurch Grammar School, and originally with 560 students. On 13 April 1964, the Prime Minister gave a talk at the school, and later in the year on 27 July the (new) prime minister also visited the school. Mr Walter May was headmaster from 1952-70. During that period, all teachers wore academic gowns in the classroom. The school motto was \\"A Good Name Endureth\\", written beneath the same emblem used by the present academy. School houses were named Harwood, Langtons, Fairkytes and Tomkyns, after historical private houses in the area. Each year a new intake of pupils joined the first form, selected by passing the 11-plus exam. Subsequently, they were streamed by academic ability into A, Alpha, B and C streams. The school buildings were extended several times, eventually accommodating over 800 boys and girls, Additions included woodwork and metalwork shops, an annex for the sixth form including a student common room, a cricket pavilion, a language lab with reel to reel tape recorders, and a swimming pool. The last two were paid for by fundraising organised by the Parents' Association (there was no Parent‚ÄìTeacher Association). In the early 1970s, the school held several notable school dances with visiting bands who later became world-famous, including The Sweet on 31 March 1969, and Roxy Music and Supertramp on the same bill on 25 July 1972. =Change to Comprehensive School= Mr May was succeeded by Mr John Fowler in 1970, who guided the changes to become a comprehensive school in 1973 named Emerson Park School. Several years later the sixth form was transferred to a new, separate sixth form college. =Sports College= The school was officially opened as a Specialist Sports College by Sir Trevor Brooking in 2004. =Academy= The school became an academy in 2011 and renamed Emerson Park Academy, having around 1,000 students. The school continues to specialise in sports. Academic performance The Academy was inspected by Ofsted in November 2011 and was deemed to be a \\"good school with outstanding features\\". In 2011 over 72% of students achieved 5 or more A*- C GCSE grades, including English and Mathematics. The number of students achieving 5 A* - C GCSE grades or more across the curriculum increased to 88%. This performance placed the Academy in the top 4 schools in the Borough and performing above average. In 2012 59% of students achieved 5 or more A*- C GCSE grades, including English and Mathematics. This performance placed the Academy in the bottom five schools in the Borough and performing below average. Havering is one of the better London LEAs, with many well-performing schools. A-level provision is available at the nearby Havering Sixth Form College. In 2014, results dropped to the lowest level in 7 years, with only 55% of students achieved 5 or more A*- C GCSE grades, including English and Mathematics. This is 5% lower than the LEA average.

Released in 2008, it features a performance from June 1, 2001 by the band at the Rock im Park festival in Nuremberg, Germany. In the UK, it was released as an album with a bonus DVD containing video of the performance, while the video was solely released as a DVD in the United States.  Production and content  Limp Bizkit's set at the Rock im Park festival in Nuremberg, Germany was filmed and recorded. The video portion of the album featured one of the band's last performances with Wes Borland before he left the band in 2001. The band performed some of their best known and hit songs, accompanied by a dancer dressed as one of the creatures on the cover of their album Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. During the performance, Borland wore body paint, and Durst performed a portion of the set in the audience.  Music and lyrics  The music of Rock im Park 2001 has predominately been described as nu metal and is noted for \\"kinetic, frenzied energy\\". On this compilation, DJ Lethal functions as a sound designer for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, \\"I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. [...] It's all different stuff that you haven't heard before. I'm trying to be like another guitar player.\\" Wes Borland's guitar playing in this performance is experimental and nontraditional, and is noted for creative use of a seven-string guitar. His guitar playing makes use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland's guitar playing also has unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks. Durst's lyrics are often profane, scatological or angry. Much of Durst's lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life. His breakups have inspired the songs \\"Nookie\\" and \\"Re-Arranged\\".  Reception  Allmusic writer Greg Prato panned the release. Prato in particular was critical of Durst's performance on the set, writing, \\"[he] seems not all that interested in working the crowd or putting his heart into the performance at hand.\\" Prato concluded, \\"Perhaps it's best to look at Rock in the Park 2001 as John Waters-esque footage that, years from now, will either become an underground hit due to its absurdity or an inadvertent \\"time period relic\\" √† la Heavy Metal Parking Lot.\\" Track listing Personnel *Fred Durst - vocals *Wes Borland - guitar, backing vocals *Sam Rivers - bass, backing vocals *John Otto - drums, percussion *DJ Lethal - turntables, samples, keyboards References Category:Limp Bizkit live albums Category:2008 video albums Category:Limp Bizkit video albums Category:Live video albums Category:2008 live albums ","title":"Rock im Park 2001"},{"id":"16697895","text":"Jean-Marie Berckmans in Antwerp Jean-Marie Henri Berckmans (28 October 1953 in Leopoldsburg - 31 August 2008 in Antwerp) was a Belgian cult writer.

Houghton Mifflin) The Narrows is a 1953 novel by African- American writer Ann Petry. The name \\"The Narrows\\" is the African-American section of the fictional town of Monmouth, Connecticut, in which most of the novel's action takes place. Though less famous than Petry's earlier novel, The Street, The Narrows is her longest novel and, critic Hilary Holladay argues, her most complex: ‚ÄúThe Narrows represents the full flowering of Petry‚Äôs preoccupation with human relationships.‚ÄùHolladay, Hilary. Ann Petry. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1996. The novel is written in the third person, narrated from the perspective of several different characters, often in flashback episodes. Setting The epigraph in The Narrows from Henry V suggests that Shakespeare‚Äôs history play is the inspiration for the fictional town name of Monmouth, Connecticut: > ‚Äú... I tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the ‚Äôorld, I warrant > you sall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the > situations, look you, is both alike. There is a river in Macedon; and there > is also moreover a river at Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it > is out of my prains what is the name of the other river; but ‚Äôtis all one, > ‚Äôtis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmons in both.‚Äù > (Fluellen, King Henry V, Act IV, vii) ‚ÄúThe Narrows‚Äù itself, as a neighborhood within Monmouth, is also called by the names ‚ÄúEye of the Needle, The Bottom, Little Harlem, Dark Town, Niggertown‚Äîbecause Negroes had replaced those earlier immigrants, the Irish, the Italians and the Poles.‚ÄùPetry, Ann.

He suffers from ulcers, partly because of the stress of maintaining his upper-middle-class lifestyle. Plot summary The novel's non-flashback narrative arc occurs within the period of a few months. At the beginning of this time, the Powthers move in as Abbie Crunch's boarders. The main action begins when Link ‚Äúrescues‚Äù Camilla Treadway Sheffield (who gives her name as ‚ÄúCamilo Williams‚Äù) from the advances of Cat Jimmie, a disabled veteran. Link does not realize that Camilo is white until later in the evening. Eventually, Link and Camilo begin a clandestine affair, primarily meeting in New York, though sometimes spending the night in Abbie's house in The Narrows. On one of these occasions, Abbie finds the two in bed together and angrily throws Camilo out of the house. Link finds out, when Bill Hod leaves an old newspaper around for him to see, that Camilo is really Camilla Treadway Sheffield; in other words, not only is she white, but she is also rich and married. Link fears that Camilo is merely repeating a pattern from the days of slavery: ‚ÄúI bid two hundred; look at his teeth, make it three hundred; look at his muscle, look at his back; the lady says one thousand dollars. Sold to the lady for a thousand dollars. Plantation buck. Stud.‚ÄùPetry, The Narrows, 1953, p. 280. He breaks off the relationship with Camilla, but she is convinced that he must be seeing another woman. In revenge, she screams and tears her clothing, accusing him of attempted rape when the police arrive. There is little circumstantial evidence for her accusation and, in the intervening time before the trial, Camilla begins drinking too much. One day, while driving intoxicated, she hits a child with her car (thereby destroying what credibility she might have had in court). Her mother, Mrs. Treadway, bribes Peter Bullock to keep the story out of the newspaper. However, Mrs. Treadway and Captain Sheffield still want to assure Camilla's victory in court, so they kidnap Link and try to make him sign a confession. When he ‚Äúconfesses‚Äù that he and Camilla were in love, Captain Sheffield shoots and kills him. In the aftermath of Link's murder, Mrs. Treadway and Captain Sheffield are arrested. Abbie, however, realizes that Bill Hod will not rest until Camilla has paid for her part in Link's death. At the end of the novel, she resolves to go to the police, tell them of her suspicions, and therefore end the chain of violence. She takes J.C. Powther along with her, symbolizing her ‚Äúadoption‚Äù of him and her resolve to care for him as she had failed to do for Link.

Author of the monument: sculptor Yesken Sergebayev Sultanmahmut Toraygirov (, 29 October 1893 ‚àí 21 May 1920) was a prominent Kazakh writer and poet. He was born in Qyzyl Tau (near the city of Kokshetau) but moved to Bayanaul in the province of Pavlodar at the age of four. Toraygirov wrote his first poems when only 13 years old. From 1913 on, he was the sub-editor for the first Kazakh journal Aikap. In 1914 and 1915 he worked as a teacher in Bayanaul. In 1916 Toraygirov moved to Tomsk in Russia, but the next year the February Revolution made him return to Semey, in Kazakhstan. During this time he developed his style and wrote prolifically. Toraygirov released several poem collections and his novel Beauty Kamar, released posthumously in 1933, was one of the first Kazakh language novels. He was very active politically, advocating both Kazakh national interests and the new Soviet ideals. Toraygirov died in 1920 at the age of 26.

History In the Middle Ages, the Catholic mass ritual included a sermon in the vernacularhttp://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton/collections/early_manuscripts/preaching/language.cfm.  Characteristics  A sermon focuses on an aspect of a selected theme (thema) taken from the Gospel reading of the day. The popular sermon began with a thema, a lesson based on the gospel of the day. The prothema or antethema, a statement and/or prayer by the preacher, followed the thema. Sometimes the preacher skipped the prothema and delivered a prelocution, proof of the thema, by citing sources of authority instead. The thema was then restated and followed by the process, a breakdown of multiple parts of the thema‚Äîthe historical, allegorical (personified), tropological (moralized), and anagogical (the mystical). Finally, the sermon would close with a recitation (a quick review) and a benediction (blessing).  Audience  The popular sermon was delivered in local churches, to people of high and low estate. When the churches were too small to contain the audience, the sermon was then moved to the public green. In either setting, the audience was usually unconstrained and could be rude and discourteous to the preacher. It was not uncommon for the people in attendance to move freely about and socialize with one another, address the friar, or walk out on the friar in the middle of his sermon. Thus, to keep the attention of the people, the popular sermon needed to be short and include elements which the people could relate to or find interest in. The friar might tell an anecdote, use folklore or verse sermon. To help make a point, it was not uncommon for the friar to embellish concerns of good and evil. The friar would use the occasional large word or a word from a foreign language to impress the lay audience. The result was a vibrant, creative and well-received sermon.  Training and licensure  All friars were required to be trained and licensed by the church before they were allowed to preach. The friars studied treatises on sermon making. These treatises dictated that the preacher should speak slowly, clearly and in a serious manner; he was to remain focused; he should dress, speak, and behave in a conservative manner; and, when speaking, he should neither stand still nor be flamboyant with his gestures. Although the treatise dictated the friars follow these directives, the friars bent the rules as they saw fit.  Published sermons  The friars wrote their own sermons or they based their sermon upon the written works of other friars and clergy. The four classifications of the popular sermon were the improvised, the prepared, the memorized, and the read (Roberts, 77). Many of the popular sermons from this era were published‚Äîmeaning that they were either preached in the vernacular or written down in Latin, but not necessarily both (Roberts, 77). Most of the written sermons that were later preached were not verbatim to the written word. As the sermon was written in Latin and the oratory was done in the vernacular, the words changed with the translation. This is the dual nature of the popular sermon. The most accurate resources available to us today are the sermons that were written by a person of the clergy in the audience who took notes (in Latin) and formally recorded with the intent to be used as a resource. A great number of these documents are available today in manuscript form; some are available in published collections. These popular sermons provide an authentic insight to the people and the times.

Early life After studying at Culver Military Academy, he earned an undergraduate degree from Yale University in 1924 and a M.D. from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1928. He was director of the surgical laboratory at the Yale School of Medicine from 1933 to 1935. From 1937 to 1968, he was a director of the Upjohn Company, the pharmaceuticals company founded by his grandfather, William E. Upjohn. In 1937, he married Mary Meader in Maryland. Photographic flight Dr. Light was well known among flying enthusiasts for his 1934 around-the-world flight and wanted to approximate the same to celebrate their marriage. While planning the trip, many parts of the world had not been photographed from above and the American Geographical Society encouraged photographic flights to build an archive of aerial views. His idea was to fly over areas of South America and Africa that had never been captured on film from the air and Meader was happy to go along with it. Meader had to take flying lessons and learn Morse code in able to become her husband's co-pilot, navigator, and radio operator. During training, she gave birth to her first son, Christopher. In an interview with Encore Magazine in 2006, when asked why she decided to take the journey, she replied: \\"It just seemed like a great adventure ‚Äì something I wanted to do. Why? I'm not certain, other than we both knew we would be doing something that hadn't been done before.\\" The two Lights took off out of Kalamazoo in September 1937 in a Bellanca monoplane, whose cabin lacked heat and pressurization. To survive, they had to breathe oxygen from a tank with wooden mouthpieces. Wearing a fur coat and a boot, Meader took photographs out of a window frame. The Lights were banned from photographing Central America, Ecuador, and Colombia, to prevent the gathering of strategic knowledge. They, however, were allowed to take pictures over Peru, and took the earliest photographs of the Nazca lines. While unable to distinguish from the ground, from the air the designs range from simple patterns to hummingbirds and llamas. After photographing South America, the couple crossed the Atlantic to Cape Town, South Africa. While there, she photographed the ice dome and crater of Mount Kilimanjaro and the glaciated pinnacles of Mount Kenya. In addition, her photographs include different views of native villages, urban areas, and the Egyptian pyramids, as well as several other subjects. On an average day they would rise at 4 a.m. and fly until 11 a.m, afterwich they would visit the farms, mines, and native settlements that would be photographed the next day. The couple's original plan was to fly into Asia; however, this was not accomplished due to the damaging of the plane and Meader's pregnancy with a second child. The two returned to Kalamazoo in February 1938. In all, Meader took over 1,000 photographs in her two flights. Later life After the flight, Light wrote the book Focus on Africa, which included his wife's photos and published by the American Geographical Society. The book was only the second which included aerial photos. A 1941 review of the book by Mary Jobe Akeley of the New York Times called the pictures \\"superb\\". Light and Meader divorced in the early 1960s. He served as a member of the Yale University Council from 1956 to 1963 and was the founder of the Richard U. Light Foundation. In 1962, Light created an undergraduate scholarship awarded annually.

It was broadcast in syndication on April 3, 1994. This, along with Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights, was one of Don Messick's last voice-over roles; he suffered a debilitating stroke in 1996 and died in 1997. Plot Ranger Smith's boss, the Supreme Commissioner, is attending Jellystone Park's Easter Jamboree. Concerned about making sure the event goes off perfectly, Smith picks out an Easter Bunny suit and orders a truckload of candy for the celebration, ordering his guard, Mortimer, to watch over the candy truck and keep Yogi Bear away from eating any of the candy. Mortimer, however, is legally blind and Yogi steals the Easter Bunny outfit, tricks Mortimer into thinking he is the real Easter Bunny, and eats all the candy in the truck. Smith is furious and threatens to deport Yogi to the Siberian Circus (just as he had threatened in the previous film), but Boo Boo offers to find the real Easter Bunny and bring him to the jamboree. Smith states that he stopped believing in the Easter Bunny after he didn't get a double-decker raspberry- filled dark chocolate egg from him, but happily accepts Boo Boo's offer. Ranger Smith fears that he too will end up being transferred to Siberia by the commissioner if the jamboree fails. Yogi and Boo Boo seek out the Grand Grizzly in the mountains to see if he knows anything about the Easter Bunny's whereabouts. The cantankerous Grand Grizzly instructs Yogi and Boo Boo to seek the big ears in the sky (a hilltop resembling rabbit ears). They reach the mountain, using the park's hot air balloon, only to find that the Easter Bunny has been kidnapped. Behind the kidnapping is a short and deranged businessman named Paulie, hellbent on replacing all of the world's Easter eggs with plastic ones, and his massive but dim-witted sidekick named Ernest. Yogi and Boo Boo follow a trail of jelly beans to the factory, where the Easter Bunny is being held captive above a vat of molten plastic. Posing as health inspectors, Yogi and Boo Boo successfully free the Easter Bunny, only to find that Millicent the Magical Easter Chicken is the one responsible for laying the Easter eggs. Yogi and Boo Boo go to the Easter Henhouse to meet her but are accosted by her guard dog, who refuses entry to anyone except Ernest, whom the dog mistakes for the real Easter Bunny. Yogi and Boo Boo, after using a giant slingshot to crash through the henhouse's roof, escape with the chicken before Paulie and Ernest can get to her and head for Jellystone Park. A madcap chase after the chicken begins, with the Easter Bunny falling off a cliff and getting seriously injured three times. Meanwhile, back at Jellystone Park, Smith is trying in vain to impress the children and the Commissioner at the Easter Jamboree. The stunts he tries either are ridiculously lame or fail spectacularly, and the Commissioner's grandchildren show no response except a few sarcastic claps and a stern look. The boss is on the verge of firing Ranger Smith when the Easter Bunny, Millicent, Yogi, and Boo Boo fall in to save the day. The Commissioner changes his mind and instead promotes Ranger Smith, who decides to let Yogi stay at Jellystone; to thank Ranger Smith for believing, the Easter Bunny gives him what he asked for all these years: a double-decker raspberry-filled dark chocolate egg.

On 1 February 2008, it was granted NHS Foundation Trust Status. It merged into Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust in 2017 Services The first Birmingham maternity hospital was established in 1842 to reduce the number of women and children dying needlessly from puerperal fever and childbirth related infections. This hospital has been at its present site since 1994, and is one of only two trusts in the UK specialising in women's health care. They provide a focused range of health care services, primarily, though not exclusively, to women and their families. These are: *Maternity and foetal medicine services *Neonatal care and newborn transport service *Milk bank‚Äîthe only one in the West Midlands. It provides donor breast milk for its own neonatal babies and also distributes donor breast milk to many local and national hospitals including Birmingham Children's Hospital. *Fertility services, see separate entry for the Birmingham Women's Fertility Centre *Gynaecology *Genetics‚Äîits genetics laboratories are one of the largest in Europe and, as part of a collaboration with the University of Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS FT, Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS FT and Academic Health Science Network, it will be one of 11 centres across the country that are leading the way in delivering the NHS 100,000 Genomes Project. *Imaging and pathology services‚Äîtesting more than 60,000 samples a year. Based in Edgbaston, adjacent to the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, there are around 150 adult beds and 43 neonatal cots. It had an annual income of over ¬£90 million. On average 50,000 patients a year are cared for, with approximately 3,000 operations and delivery of more than 8,000 babies making it one of the busiest maternity departments in the UK. As a specialist teaching healthcare trust, the focus is on delivering five distinct but inter-related clinical services. Brought together, these services combine to offer secondary local services to women, men and babies living in South Birmingham and tertiary services throughout the West Midlands and beyond. The trust established a National Sperm Bank in January 2015 in a partnership with the National Gamete Donation Trust. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ The trust had no cases of MRSA Bacteraemia or C. difficle colitis for more than five years, which makes it one of the best performing trusts in the UK. Future prospects Sarah-Jane Marsh, Chief Executive of Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, was appointed Chief Executive with effect from 1 July 2015. She will manage both trusts. She is to review the trust's rebuilding plans, and will consider a range of options, including rebuilding with the children's hospital, and a standalone solution. If the trusts agree to rebuild on a single site, a merger would be considered. The trust agreed in July 2016 that it would merge with the Children‚Äôs Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in 2017.

The model shows how females may gain a higher level of biological fitness by mating with a male who already has a mate. The female makes this choice despite other surrounding males because the choice male's genetics, territory, food supply, or other important characteristics are better than those of his competitors, even with two females on the territory. Graphical depiction The graphical depiction of the model presented in Gordon Orians' 1969 paper is often used to explain the concept. The graph shows two curves on a graph of biological fitness versus environmental quality. Environmental quality refers to the quality of the male's territory. The left curve, labeled monogamous, is the perceived biological fitness for a female entering into a monogamous relationship with a given male. The right curve, labeled bigamous, shows the fitness of the same female entering into a relationship with a different male who already has one female mate but who has defended more resources. The second curve is roughly the first curve shifted to the right some amount. The given shapes of the curve will change with other intrinsic factors like genetic quality and male paternal investment. It is important to note that the designation \\"female\\" and \\"male\\" here are oft accurate; however, in some mating systems the operational sex ratio leans towards females, who then have motivation to engage in resource defence polyandry (provided the requirements of economic defendability are met). The intersection of the vertical dotted line on the left with the monogamous curve indicates the biological fitness of a female who chooses a monogamous male with a lower environmental quality. The intersection of the vertical dotted line on the right with the bigamous curve indicates the biological fitness of a female who enters into a bigamous relationship with the male of a higher environmental quality. The difference between these two intersection points, labeled PT, is the polygyny threshold. It is the gain of environmental quality for the female when she chooses the bigamous relationship and thus the minimum environmental quality difference necessary to make bigamy beneficial for the female. Also important is the vertical line drawn from the intersection of the line with the bigamy curve to the monogamy curve above. This represents the fitness gain of a female who chooses monogamy over bigamy due to, here, resource holding differences. Orians predicted that animals exhibiting resource defence polygyny, such as the fish Neolamprologus pulcher would fit to this model when living in successive habitats, where territory quality is very variable. Using the territory quality to decide whether to pursue a monogamous or polygynous mating relationship. This is shown in the red-winged blackbird by Pribil and Searcy (2001). Female red-winged blackbirds prefer to mate with males with territories over water and also unmated males. The females were given a choice between unmated males or previously mated males with the superior territories over water. In 12 out of 14 trials (86%) females chose the already mated male with the superior territory. Costs of polygyny According to William A. Searcy and Ken Yasukawa, the term cost of polygyny is defined as the net costs of polygyny after the summation of all of the component costs and benefits. Costs include less parental care and increased competition between females for the male's provision and food among other resources. A benefit could be group defense of the territory and resources. Searcy and Yasukawa graphically defined the distance between curve 1 (monogamous line) and curve 2 (bigamous line) of the polygyny threshold model graph (see above) to be the cost of polygyny. N. B. Davies further defined it as the cost of sharing in order to be clear that the term refers to the fitness cost to females that are breeding on the same territory. Searcy and Yasukawa conducted studies on Pennsylvania red-winged blackbirds that showed that females would mate on territory already settled by another female, which indicated that there was no cost of polygyny. However, in a later study by Pribil and Picman conducted on Ontario populations of red-winged blackbirds the results indicated that there was indeed a cost of polygyny. The females in this study were given a choice between adjacent territories, one in which there was already a settled female (defined by many researchers as the primary female) and the other in which there was no female present. In all 16 situations, the females chose the unsettled land in which she could be monogamous.Pribil, S and Jaroslav Picman. \\"Polygyny in the red-winged blackbird: do females prefer monogamy or polygamy?\\". Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 38. 3 (1996): 183-190. Web. Davies, Krebs, and West, in their textbook An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology, cited another Pribil study noting the polygyny cost to the red-winged blackbird females. The effect of polygyny made them less effective mothers when they were removed and taken to a more isolated population, proven by the fact that the mothers from monogamous relationships had better adaptation to the new environment.Davies, Nicholas B., John R. Krebs, and Stuart A. West. An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology. 4th ed. John Wiley & Sons, 2012. Print. In an earlier text, Davies explores the examples of costs, showing that the cost is not always to the second and subsequently joining females. He asserts that there are situations in which the cost is shared between the primary and secondary female. He also mentions scenarios in which the primary female receives a decrease in her fitness upon addition of the secondary female to the harem. There are many other studies concerning the polygyny threshold model and costs to polygyny using other species. Staffan Bensch conducted a study on the great reed warbler that showed the only cost of polygyny to these females to be higher mortality of nestlings that were belonging to the primary female. Johnson, Kermott, and Lien conducted a study on the house wren (Troglodytes aedon) showing that there were inherent polygyny costs to these female populations, also. The secondary females lost more of the broods largely because of starvation, and they also experienced lesser reproductive success in other areas. One of the main factors in their decreased fitness was less male aid. Kyle Summers and David Earn studied female poison frogs, genus Dendrobates, to see if the polygyny costs drove the evolution of the parental care system from a female care to biparental or paternal care. They deduced that the costs could not be concluded to be the sole cause of this parental transition. The numerous studies concerning polygyny costs show the different factors that not only cause these costs, but are also affected by these costs.

Also known as the Atlantic Metroport at East 34th Street, it is a public heliport owned by New York City and run by the Economic Development Corporation. History The East 34th Street Heliport opened on the site of the original East 34th Street Ferry Landing in 1972, providing charter, commuter, and sightseeing flights, and served as a replacement for the heliport atop the Pan Am Building, which closed in 1968 before reopening for 3 months in 1977, ending in a May helicopter crash that killed 5. Sikorsky S-58 of New York Helicopter at 34th Street when operating a schedule to New York JFK in 1987 During the 1980s and early 1990s, New York Helicopter operated frequent scheduled services from the Heliport to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. Fourteen-seat turbine-powered Sikorsky S-58T helicopters were used on this service. After several residential high rises were developed in the neighborhood in the 1980s, the city was pressured into reducing helicopter traffic in the area. Sightseeing flights were banned from the heliport in 1997. In 1998, operations were further restricted by limiting flights from 8 am to 8 pm on weekdays and from 10 am to 6 pm on weekends. Weekend flights were banned altogether later in the year. US Helicopter began providing regularly scheduled passenger service from the East 34th Street Heliport to John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in 2007, but shut down operations in September 2009. As of November 2009, it was uncertain if or when scheduled shuttle service would start up again. Current operations Since this is a heliport and not an airport, there are no Instrument Procedures for this facility. The level of boating traffic in the neighboring East River requires that pilots exercise caution in making their approach to the heliport's landing pad.  Statistics  72% of the flights are airtaxi, 18% general aviation, 9% commuters, and less than 1% military.  Accidents and incidents  * On May 23, 1974, David Frank Kamaiko, a 22-year man from Greenwich Village claiming to be a member of the Jewish Defense League, hijacked a helicopter from the East 34th Street Heliport and demanded $2 million in ransom. After landing on top of the Pan Am Building, the pilot tried to escape and Kamaiko shot him in the arm. The hijacker was held back by the other hostage inside the helicopter until he was taken into custody by police. * On February 27, 1975, a Bell 47G-2A on a non- commercial flight from Garden City crashed into a fence while attempting to land at the 34th Street Heliport in gusty wind conditions. The pilot survived but was severely burned in the resulting fire. *On April 26, 1985, the engine on an A√©rospatiale SA 360 Dauphin failed shortly after takeoff from the East 34th Street Heliport, sending the helicopter into the East River. Five passengers and two crewmembers were rescued but one passenger trapped inside the submerged craft was killed. * On May 2, 1988, a Bell 206-B on a sightseeing flight around Manhattan crashed into the East River near Long Island City while preparing to land at the East 34th Street Heliport, killing one person and injuring four others. * On February 10, 1990, a strong gust of wind sent a Bell 206-L on a sightseeing flight crashing into the East River shortly after taking off from the East 34th Street Heliport. A 14-year-old boy was unconscious when pulled from the wreckage and later died. The pilot and three other passengers (including the boy's father and two French tourists) were injured but survived the crash. * On June 17, 2005, a Sikorsky S-76C carrying six corporate executives from MBNA returning to Delaware after a business meeting in New York City crashed into the East River less than one minute after taking off from the East 34th Street Heliport. All eight people aboard survived the crash. * On October 4, 2011, a Bell 206 crashed into the East River killing one person after taking off from the East 34th Street Heliport. The pilot and three other passengers on board were rescued. One week after the accident, a second passenger died as a result of injuries sustained in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board report on the crash, released on December 20, 2012, said the cause was excess weight in the helicopter; the aircraft is rated to carry , but it was estimated to have weighed between and at takeoff. * On June 10, 2019, an AgustaWestland AW109 Power en route to Linden, New Jersey, crashed into the AXA Equitable Center, Seventh Avenue, which sparked a fire on the top of the building, killing the pilot Tim McCormack.

His controversial actions at the Battle of Franklin in 1864 overshadowed his positive performance earlier in the war. Early life and career Wagner was born in rural Ross County, Ohio. When he was four years old, Wagner's family moved to Warren County, Indiana, where he was educated in the common schools. He became a prosperous farmer, and was elected in 1856 as a Republican to the Indiana House of Representatives. Two years later, he was elected to the State Senate. He was selected as the president of the Indiana State Agricultural Society, a post he held when the Civil War began in April 1861 with the bombardment of Fort Sumter in South Carolina. Civil War service In June of that year, Wagner enlisted in the state volunteer troops as colonel of the 15th Indiana Infantry and initially served in western Virginia. He commanded the 21st brigade in the Army of the Ohio during the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. He subsequently participated in the Battle of Perryville and commanded the 21st brigade in the Army of the Cumberland at the Battle of Stones River at the end of the year. In April 1863, he was promoted to brigadier general, backdated to November 29, 1862. Wagner commanded the 21st brigade during Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans's occupation of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in September 1863. Wagner's 21st brigade was kept as the garrison force in Chattanooga during the battle of Chickamauga. His men suffered heavy losses in an assault on Missionary Ridge during the Chattanooga Campaign. Wagner was again active in the 1864 Atlanta Campaign, commanding the 2nd brigade in the IV Corps, which suffered exceptionally heavy losses at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, and a division during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. His military career was ruined at the Battle of Franklin. He diverged from the orders of his superior, Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox, to withdraw his outnumbered force from an exposed forward position. Instead, he chose to stand firm and face the impending assault. Two of his brigades were routed, and running toward the primary defensive line, intermixed with the attacking Confederates. As a result, the main Union force held its fire for fear of killing friendly troops, allowing the Confederate assault column to penetrate the Union center.Jacobson, pp. 278-82. Federal reinforcements finally stabilized the position, but Wagner's controversial course of action drew significant criticism and questioning. As a result of the debacle, Wagner asked to be relieved of duty, citing concerns for his wife's health. Wagner was returned to Indiana to await orders. He briefly served in St. Louis, Missouri, toward the end of the war. He was mustered out of the service in August 1865. Postbellum career Less than a year after the war ended, Wagner's wife died from her infirmities. He established a legal practice in Williamsport, Indiana, in 1866. He once again became president of the state Agricultural Society and was influential in helping publicize modern agricultural practices and procedures. Wagner died unexpectedly in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was buried at Armstrong Cemetery in Green Hill, Indiana, not far from the farm where he was raised.

History The Basilica of Santa Engracia is believed to have been built on the spot where Saint Engratia and her companions were said to have been martyred in 303 AD. Early in the fourth century, a tomb was built on the site of the Christian-Roman necropolis. Around 609 the Abbey of Santa Engracia was established to house the relics of Saint Engratia and the many martyrs of Saragossa.History, Parish of Saint Engratia The Abbey was demolished around 1492 when Ferdinand II of Aragon founded the Hieronymus monastery of Santa Engracia. After his election to the papacy, Pope Hadrian VI passed through Zaragoza on his way to Rome, spending Holy Week at Santa Egratia. King Philip III visited in 1599.

South Africa (then part of the British Empire) captured the area now known as Namibia from Germany during World War I and governed it, by the name 'South West Africa', until 1990, when the country gained independence under the name 'Namibia'. During those 75 years, thousands of South Africans settled in the territory and South Africa treated the area as an internal province, imposing apartheid laws in South West Africa as it did in South Africa.Schenoni, Luis (2017) \\"Subsystemic Unipolarities?\\"in Strategic Analysis, 41(1): 74-86 Both nations are members of the African Union, Commonwealth of Nations, Southern African Development Community and the United Nations. South-West Africa and Namibian independence (1915-1990) SWAPO soldiers during the South African Border War; 1984. During World War I, South Africa captured and occupied what was then German South-West Africa beginning in 1915. After the war, the League of Nations removed overseas territories from a defeated Germany and they mandated the territory to South Africa as a trusteeship, as a 'Class C Mandate', known as South West Africa. South Africa proposed that it be allowed to annex South West Africa; a proposal rejected by the United Nations General Assembly as successor to the League of Nations; though the South African government refused to accept the United Nations' authority. As a result, South West Africa continued to be administered directly by South African administrators in Pretoria as a province and many white South African settlers came to the country. South African Apartheid was also introduced into the country and led to the creation of tribal homelands for black inhabitants of the country. In August 1966, the South African Border War began between the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and the South African Defence Force. SWAPO's goal was to obtain independence from South African dominance. SWAPO had majority international support and received military assistance from neighboring independent nations, Angola's People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and Cuba. In June 1968, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming that, in accordance with the desires of its people. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 269, adopted in August 1969, declared South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia illegal. The war lasted until March 1990 with South-West Africa winning its independence and the country was renamed Namibia. In 1993, South Africa ceded Walvis Bay to Namibia: this small enclave was never part of German West Africa and so had not been part of the mandate territory. Post-Namibian independence (1990-) In 1994, apartheid ended in South Africa and Nelson Mandela was elected President of the country. Since then, relations between Namibia and South Africa have remained close. There have been numerous visits between leaders of both nations and several agreements have been signed. The economy of Namibia is also closely linked to South Africa in terms of trade and South African companies have a large number of investments in the key industries in Namibia such as mining, retail, banking and insurance.Bilateral relations between South Africa and Namibia Namibia contributes greatly to the growth and development of the South African tourism industry.

Michael K, a 43-year-old New Yorker currently living in California, started blogging semi- anonymously, leaving out his last name because he held a full-time job at an Internet company and would perform much of his blogging from the office.

Design  HTMS Thonburi 4 days before fight Thonburi and her sister ship, , were designed following the incorporation of the earlier s into the Siamese Navy in the 1920s. The Ratanakosindra class were British- built ships which featured six-inch guns in two turrets and light armor. Under Plaek Pibulsonggram's command, the Siamese Navy began a series of modernization efforts. Priorities for the navy consisted of protecting the extensive Thai coastline, and coastal gunboats were viewed as the best resource. Several foreign firms from European countries offered a variety of designs, but in the end the Japanese company Kawasaki won the tender. The new vessels were basically larger versions of the earlier Ratanakosindra ships. The ships were laid down at Kawasaki's facilities in 1936, and the first, Sri Ayuthia, was launched on 21 July 1937. The resulting \\"battleships,\\" as they were referred to in Siam at the time, displaced 2,265 tons, featured increased armor protection (protecting machinery and gun turrets), and were powered by twin diesels produced by MAN of Germany. Armament consisted of four /50 calibre guns mounted in pairs in two turrets. The Japanese 8-inch rifles were of the same type as mounted in early Imperial Japanese Navy heavy cruisers and the aircraft carriers and . The main armament had a maximum range of at 25 degrees of elevation. A tower above the bridge featured a gun director for aiming the main guns. Additional armament consisted of four 3-inch and four 40-mm guns. The new ships were enthusiastically received by the Siamese Navy. Purchasing further vessels of the type was considered by the government, but ultimately it was decided to purchase two Italian-built light cruisers in 1938. Both ships were seized by Italy in 1941 before construction had finished (they were never completed), leaving Thonburi and her sister ship as the most powerful combatants in Siamese service.  Service  HTMS Thonburi Memorial, Royal Thai Naval Academy, Samut Prakan, Thailand. Both ships of the class had entered service by the time hostilities had broken out in Europe during the Second World War. Thonburi engaged a Vichy French squadron in the Battle of Koh Chang on 17 January 1941. The resulting battle was nothing short of a massive defeat, as the Siamese ship was severely damaged by enemy fire and beached to prevent sinking. Thonburi was later raised and attempts were made to repair the extensive damage and continued to serve the navy as a training vessel until being stricken in 1959. Part of her bridge and forward gun turret are preserved as a memorial at the Royal Thai Naval Academy. Sri Ayuthia had a rather more unfortunate fate. She was sunk in 1951 during an attempted coup.

The company currently offers four fully staged opera productions and an educational outreach program during an annual season which runs from October through April. Performances are offered at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Downtown Nashville and the Noah Liff Opera Center in the Sylvan Heights section of West Nashville. Designed by architect Earl Swensson, the Noah Liff Opera Center houses the company's executive offices, conference facilities, and a rehearsal studio. History The Nashville Opera Guild was chartered in 1981 under the direction of Mary Cortner Ragland. They produced their first opera, Madama Butterfly, in the same year. In 1987, the Nashville Opera Guild transferred its charter to the Nashville Opera Association. Two years later, they hired their first permanent director, Kyle Ridout, whose tenure lasted five years. In 1995, the former General Director Carol Penterman (through 2012) and current Artistic Director John Hoomes joined the Nashville Opera. The Nashville Opera merged with the Tennessee Opera Theater in 1997, increasing production from one or two to four operas per season. In April 2009 the Nashville Opera's new facility, the Noah Liff Opera Center, had its grand opening. John Hoomes joined Nashville Opera in 1995 as the Artistic Director, and was named CEO and Artistic Director in 2012. As a freelance stage director, he has directed over 200 productions of opera and music theatre in the US, South America, and Canada. The New York Times declared his Nashville Opera world premiere of Elmer Gantry ‚ÄúAn Operatic Miracle...in Nashville.‚Äù A June 2010 Opera News feature article acknowledged, ‚ÄúHoomes has proved himself one of the most interesting stage directors in the regional market today with a seemingly limitless knowledge of repertoire.‚Äù Since receiving his master's degree from Indiana University, he has worked for many professional opera companies including New York City Opera, Opera Lyra Ottawa, Teatro Col√≥n, Kentucky Opera, Cincinnati Opera, Lake George Opera, Glimmerglass Opera, The Lyric Opera of Kansas City, The Opera Company of Philadelphia, Opera, The Florentine Opera, Indianapolis Opera, Opera New Jersey, The Opera Company of North Carolina, Pensacola Opera, Pittsburgh Opera, Opera Memphis, Arizona Opera, Opera Carolina, Opera Cleveland, Opera Columbus, and Sarasota Opera.

In fall 2009 Mr. Hoomes directed the Tennessee premiere of The Fall of the House of Usher by composer Philip Glass, a state of the art, multi-media production which involved ground-breaking, immersion video techniques. This innovative production was critically acclaimed both by the Wall Street Journal and Opera News. Mr. Hoomes staged the world premieres of Robert Aldridge's Elmer Gantry, as well as a second new production of the same work for Florentine Opera (recorded on Naxos Records and winner of 2 Grammys; also named the #1 opera CD release by Opera News), and the world premiere of songwriter Marcus Hummon's chamber opera, Surrender Road at Martha Rivers Ingram Hall in Nashville. Hoomes also directed the ‚ÄúSoutheastern professional premiere‚Äù of five contemporary pieces: Poulenc's La Voix Humaine and Peter Maxwell Davies‚Äô The Lighthouse, David Lang's The Difficulty of Crossing a Field, Romulus Hunt by Carly Simon, Michael Nyman's The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, and an acclaimed production of Daniel Cat√°n's opera Florencia en el Amazonas.

Russia and Cuba sought third-country financing to complete the plant in the mid 1990s but in 2000 the two countries agreed to abandon the project. A workers' town, Ciudad Nuclear, was built next to the plant and is inhabited today with many buildings left in a half-finished state.  Background  Cuba's interest in civil use of nuclear energy dated back to 1956, when Cuba and the United States signed an \\"Agreement for co-operation concerning civil uses of atomic energy\\". This agreement suggested the possibility of further cooperation extending to the design, construction, and operation of power producing nuclear reactors.No. 4294. Agreement for co-operation between the government of the United States of America and the government of the Republic of Cuba concerning civil uses of atomic energy. The agreement was reached during Fulgencio Batista's regime, later overthrown as a result of the Cuban Revolution in 1959. The treaty was ultimately terminated during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. Russian-Cuban cooperation in nuclear energy dated back to January 1967, when the Soviet Union sponsored a photo exposition, \\"Atomic Energy for Peaceful Purposes\\", at the Cuban Academy of Sciences. Nine months later both countries reached an agreement to provide Cuba with a research reactor for experimental and teaching purposes, as well as assistance in assembling and operating the equipment. In 1975 Cuban and Russian officials signed treaties for \\"Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy\\" and the \\"Establishment of Direct Scientific-Technical Co- operation in the Field of the Uses of Nuclear Energy\\". In 1976 Cuba and the Soviet Union signed an agreement to construct two 440-megawatt nuclear power reactors (VVER-440 V318) in the south central province of Cienfuegos, near the village of Juragu√°. The original plan called for 12 reactors, four each at Juragu√°, Puerto Esperanza in the western part of the island, and Holgu√≠n, in the east. The project was ultimately reduced to two 440-megawatt nuclear power reactors, both at Juragu√°. Upon completion, the first reactor would have generated over 15% of Cuba's energy demands. The construction of these reactors was a priority for Cuba because of its dependence on imported oil.Nuclear Safety: Concerns with the Nuclear Power Reactors in Cuba. (GAO/T-RCED-95-236, Aug. 1, 1995).  Design  The Juragua plant included two VVER-440 V318 nuclear power reactors, the first Soviet-designed reactors to be built in the Western Hemisphere and in a tropical environment. The VVER are pressurized water reactors (PWR) developed by the Soviet Union. The number 440 indicated the electric power in MWe of the reactor, which employed two turbines of 220 MWe each with an overall thermal power of 1,375 MWth for the reactor. The V318 model was the newest 440 MWe Soviet-model and it was based on V213, an improvement in safety standards over the older V230 reactors, which lacked an Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS). The Cuban model (V318) was also designed to have full containment with a steel-lined concrete dome structure to inhibit the release of radioactive particles in the event of a severe accident.  Construction  Architectural model, on display at neighbouring fortress Castillo de Jagua (2016) Under the supervision of Fidel Castro D√≠az-Balart, the construction of the first reactor began in 1983 and the second in 1985. Most of the reactor parts, except for civil construction materials, were supplied by the Soviet Union under bilateral economic cooperation agreements. The first reactor was initially scheduled to be operational in 1993 by Cuban officials, but it was later estimated that the reactor would not be operational until late 1995 or early 1996. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union disrupted construction at Juragua, as a market economy established new economic ties and Russia began providing technical assistance to Cuba on a commercial basis. The plant was being built with the help of some Russian technicians and some of them were withdrawn after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. At the behest of the Russian Federation, Cuba negotiated with European firms such as Siemens, Cegelec and Skoda to provide Instrumentation and Control equipment to upgrade the safety standards of the plant. In the 1970s Russia had successfully constructed Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant in Finland through a joint venture with Siemens to comply with Finnish nuclear regulations. In 1992 Siemens visited the Juragua plant and agreed to install the systems but Russia was unable to pay in hard currency as demanded. Cuba was also incapable of delivering the $21 million payment that Siemens was asking for. On September 5, 1992, Cuban President Fidel Castro announced a suspension of construction at Juragua due to Cuba's inability to meet the financial terms set by Russia to complete the reactors. Castro stated that more than 1.1 billion dollars had been invested. A September 1992 GAO report estimated that civil construction on the first reactor ranged from 90 to 97% complete with only 37% of the reactor equipment installed, while the second reactor was only between 20 and 30% completed. The primary components had not been installed and the nuclear fuel was not delivered.Nuclear Safety: Concerns with the Nuclear Power Reactors in Cuba. (GAO/T-RCED-92-262, September 1992). Russian press reported that at least one reactor, without nuclear fuel, and its steam turbine set were delivered to Cuba. =Allegations of problems and defects= United States opposition to the project had existed since the 1980s, but upon Soviet Union's withdrawal, concerns over Cuba's ability to safely operate the plant surfaced. In the eventuality of a nuclear accident, radioactive fallout from an accident could reach United States territory on the third day after an accident. United States president Bill Clinton stated in April 1993 that the United States opposed the construction of the plant because of safety concerns and Cuba's refusal to sign the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty or ratify the Treaty of Tlatelolco. Some media referred to the plant as a potential \\"Cuban Chernobyl\\" and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a United States Representative from Florida and born in La Havana, described the plant as \\"a potential Chernobyl in our own backyard\\". Cuba also met with criticism related to the inadequate storage of deteriorating mechanical equipment. In a September 1992 report to the Congress, Cuban nuclear plant workers that emigrated to the United States stated that the nuclear facility presented problems that could affect the safe operation of the reactors and their construction. According to these workers, the Cuban technicians did not have a good system to check the reactor's components provided by the Soviet Union. A former Cuban technician, responsible for checking the welds in the civil construction, claimed that from about 5,000 weld sites that had passed inspection, 10 to 15 percent were defective. According to another worker, individuals trained to be reactor operators received five months of instruction from the Russians on a simulator that did not resemble the reactor under construction in Cuba. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Cuban leader Fidel Castro agreed to abandon the project after Putin's visit to Havana in December 2000. =Attempts to resume construction= In 1995 the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy announced that it intended to resume the construction of Cuba‚Äôs reactors in 1998 with financing provided by an international consortium involving Siemens, Ansaldo and √âlectricit√© de France. However, the aforementioned companies dismissed the claims and it was reported that the announcement could have been part of a political stance against United States threat to cut aid to Russia. The United States opposition on the project discouraged other countries following the Helms‚ÄìBurton Act, which continued and strengthened the United States embargo against Cuba.NUCLEAR SAFETY: International Atomic Energy Agency's Nuclear Technical Assistance for Cuba Estimates regarding the cost to finish the reactor ranged from $300 million to $750 million. In 1997 Fidel Castro announced that Cuba was no longer interested in finishing the plant and would be seeking other energy alternatives. In December 2000 Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Cuba and offered to finish one reactor by investing 800 million dollars over the course of six years. Castro subsequently announced that Cuba was no longer interested in completing the twin 440-megawatt reactor plant. This announcement was made amid the failed attempt to resolve the problem of Cuba‚Äôs debt to the former Soviet Union, inherited by Russia. In 2004, the principal turbine at the Juragua plant was removed to replace a damaged turbine at Guiteras thermoelectric plant.HOW CUBA IS GOING ECOLOGICAL - Richard Levins See also *Treaty of Tlatelolco References External links *\\"Energy and the Cuban Nuclear Program\\" by Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado *Russia, Cuba, and the Juragua Nuclear Plant - Nuclear Threat Initiative *Cuba's Juragua Nuclear Reactors TED Case Studies, Case Number: 469 *Juragua: Radioactive Falloute Threat - cartadecuba.org Category:Uncompleted nuclear reactors Category:Buildings and structures in Cienfuegos Category:Nuclear power stations using pressurized water reactors Category:Cuba‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:Soviet foreign aid ","title":"Juragua Nuclear Power Plant"},{"id":"16698675","text":"This is a list of characters that appear in Dinosaur King. The English versions of the series use names differing from the Japanese versions; in this article the English names are used.Dinosaur King brochure. Sega. Characters =D-Team= The D-Team are the protagonists of the series who are very knowledgeable about dinosaurs. They prevent the Alpha Gang from succeeding in their goal by saving the dinosaurs they can find. Among its members are: ; : :: Max Taylor is the son of a paleontologist Dr. Spike Taylor. He is the unofficial leader of D-Team. Max is mostly seen wearing a visor that has Triceratops horns which double as flashlights. He is very brash, impulsive and does not generally think his actions through. Max deeply cares for dinosaurs and hates how the Alpha Gang abuses them. His partner is a Triceratops called Chomp, which he named because he chomps away on anything he can get his mouth on. Besides having Chomp, Max owns some most of the lightning and water wild dinosaurs that they claim. ; : True name: Rex Ancient (used in the 4Kids English dub only) : :: Max's best friend. Rex was found as an infant by paleontologist Dr. Owen in an egg-like container within a dinosaur exhibit in New York. Rex is now 12 and has been left with Max and his family while his father goes searching for fossils with Dr. Owen being a family friend of the Taylor family. It is revealed in one episode that Rex was left at Max's house because his father wanted him to be near a real family. Rex's partner is a Carnotaurus he named Ace. Rex also owns most of the fire and wind dinosaurs. Rex is a good-hearted boy and is relatively quiet, but also quite short-tempered from the beginning. At the end of the first series, it is revealed that Rex's real parents are Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia and he reunites with them. In the finale, Rex, the Alpha Gang, Seth, Chomp, Ace, Paris and the Ancients return to the year 2126. ; : :: The younger sister of Dr. Reese Drake whose sunglasses double as a camera. Zoe knows when to keep focused and cares deeply for her friends. Zoe sometimes shows to be excessively fond of some stars. She owns a Parasaurolophus called Paris and also most of the grass dinosaurs. Zoe's parents are both veterinarians and own an animal hospital. In the dub of episode \\"Vaccination Vacation,\\" the Drake's home as well as the family was transported onto Zeta Point. ; : :: Dr. Spike Taylor is Max's father and a paleontologist. Like Max, Spike is obsessed with dinosaurs and runs the D-Lab. He wields a whip that often gets caught on things which are generally things he is not aiming for. Dr. Taylor can also be over-reactive when a dinosaur appears. He also saves the D-Team when they are cornered by the Alpha Gang, catches the new cards, and reclaims the lost Dino Holders from Seth. His name is a pun on \\"Spike Tail\\" (a nickname for Stegosaurus). In the \\"Mesozoic Meltdown\\" episodes, the Taylors, the Ancients, and the Drakes get captured by Spectral Space Pirates. ; : :: A scientist who is Zoe's older sister, Dr. Spike Taylor's assistant, a certified pilot, and the creator of the D-Team's Dino Holders. She maintains a calm personality at all times when around others and has a rather monotonic voice even when angry or embarrassed. Zander has feelings for Reese which she may or may not return given that she couldn't recognize Zander without her glasses. Reese stays at the D-Lab in the Mesozoic Meltdown with Rod and Laura and is later taken hostage by Seth and his Cryolophosaurus. =Alpha Gang= The Alpha Gang are the primary yet inept antagonists of the first series who abduct any dinosaur cards they find using their own dinosaurs as their muscle. They conduct experiments on the dinosaur cards they find. The Alpha Gang's headquarters is the mobile island called Zeta Point which was later revealed to be a disguised timeship called the Backlander. They later renounce their evil ways in the finale of the first season when Seth turns on them and later help the D-Team in their fight with the Spectral Space Pirates. Among its members are: ; : :: The zany, egotistic, and incompetent mad scientist who is the leader of the Alpha Gang and the grandfather of Laura and Rod. Dr. Z plans to use the dinosaur cards in his plans to rule the world. He also seems to know the history of these cards, though he was not the creator as the method was created by Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia. Dr. Z did invent the Move Cards that Dr. Ancient had been dissatisfied with. When Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia wanted to return to the year 2126 to raise a baby Rex, Dr. Z and Seth jettisoned their pods into the timestream and tried to do the same for baby Rex only for the intervention of Jonathan to prevent that. This accident caused the Alpha Gang to end up in the present day and the dinosaur cards were scattered throughout the Earth. Dr. Z often sends Ursula, Zander and Ed to obtain dinosaur cards (which were scattered when his time machine exploded) for him while he stays in his lab on Zeta Point researching and experimenting with the dinosaur cards that he already has, unless it is a certain occasion. When Ursula, Zander, and Ed fail, he always berates them for their incompetence and punishes them in different ways. Dr. Z sometimes attempts to aid them with some of his inventions, but his inventions often explode as a running gag. Of course Dr. Z has accompanied Ursula, Zander, and Ed when it came to missions that involved Dr. Z reclaiming his Secret Dinosaurs which he worked on. When he had a bad back from holding up Alpha Metal, he didn't like Seth's idea of having his grandchildren obtaining the Dinosaur Cards. In the battle against the Spectral Space Pirates, Dr. Z invented the Dino-Tectors so that the dinosaurs of the D-Team and the Alpha Gang can armor up. ; : :: Member of the Alpha Gang. Ursula works with Zander and Ed to obtain dinosaur cards for Dr. Z. She is often very conceited, acting like a queen in front of her two cohorts and possessing an elevated, almost delusional, opinion of her beauty. Whenever failure occurs with the three, Ursula thinks that it is not her own fault (even when it is), but blames the other two who keep bringing her down. A running gag is that she is often called an \\"old lady\\" (usually by Zoe, \\"Obasan\\" in Japanese, meaning grandma or grandmother) which drives her crazy, and she always knows when somebody calls her that no matter how far away they are. Dr. Owen later develops a crush on her which she doesn't return. In the second series, Ursula was being asked to marry Dr. Owen in the final episode, but she rejected him in return. ; : :: The tall sunglasses- wearing member of the Alpha Gang. Zander works with Ursula and Ed to obtain dinosaur cards for Dr. Z and is the tallest of the trio. He is usually the one who comes up with a plan that always goes horribly wrong. Zander is also the person who buys the Alpha Gang's vehicles and has to deal with the consequences when they are destroyed or lost. He tries to act smart and sophisticated, but is nervous, awkward, and cowardly most of the time. In episode 30, he develops a crush on Reese. ; : :: The short fat member of the Alpha Gang. Ed works with Ursula and Zander to obtain dinosaur cards for Dr. Z. Despite his cowardly behavior, he follows the other two anywhere even if they end up in a dangerous predicament. Ed likes cute girls and enjoys eating bananas though he is something of a glutton and is very fond of eating in general. Ed is the funny one on the team and is rather stupid. His only sign of intelligence is in \\"The Forest Fire Effect\\" when he shows them what kind of damage would be done by the fire the fight against the Spectral Space Pirates caused in the Jurassic Period (which resulted in sentient plants and giant insects). However in the video game, he is the complete opposite of how he is in the show. Ed also had a running gag in the first series on jinxing his team during missions. He doesn't have an official partner, but Ed prefers to use \\"Tank\\" a lot. ; and : Rod : Laura :: Rod and Laura Dr. Z's grandchildren. Rod is gifted with science and often helps his grandfather with his inventions. Laura is a genius with numbers and makes money playing in the stock market to fund the Alpha Gang's activities. Despite the pair being considerably more intelligent than Ursula, Zander and Ed, they generally just stay at the base and rarely come up with any plans. Seth later appoints them to obtain the dinosaurs for him when both of them feel homesick. Around the time when Seth turns against Dr. Z, Laura and Rod find out about what Dr. Z and Seth did with Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia during the trip back to their own time. In the second series, they stay with Reece while the rest of the gang travel through time, although later on they rejoin the gang when a plant invasion occurs. Unlike other members of the Alpha Gang, Rod and Laura seem to get along with Max and the others by the second series. ; : :: Seth is a mystical human with knowledge about the dinosaurs and the cards as he was the former assistant of Dr. Ancient. However, Seth's goals were to actually alter time with the altered dinosaurs he created to negate the Dinosaurs' extinction. To achieve that, Seth allies himself with Dr. Z, playing on the man's agenda and even helping him in jettisoning Dr. Ancient and Cretia's pods into the timestream. Being the most intelligent member of the Alpha Gang, Seth is often annoyed by the antics of Ursula, Zander, and Ed with whom he denies association. He is often seen assisting some of the Alpha Droids in repairing Dr. Z's time machine and even giving him a status report. At the time when Dr. Z was recuperating from a bad back, Seth had Laura and Rod obtain the dinosaur cards for his own agenda. When Jonathan manages to expose his plot, Seth finally turns on his comrades by using the Fire Scorcher move on Saurophaganax causing the D-Team and the Alpha Gang to retreat. He then caused the Alpha Gang to retreat as he turns a complete Tyrannosaurus fossil into the Black Tyrannosaurus to hold them and the D-Team at bay while he attempts to go back to the past. However, as Black Tyrannosaurus was defeated by the combined powers of the D-Team and the Alpha Gang with Max and Chomp attempting to stop him on their own, the time ship's systems overloaded with Seth sucked into the timestream as a result. He was later rescued by the Spectral Space Pirates and ally with them under the alias of . When working for the Spectral Space Pirates, Seth created Gigas, Maximus, and Armatus (presumably from the fossils that he had based their dinosaur forms off of in the same way he created the Black Tyrannosaurus). Seth later sets up a trick to sneak into the D-Team's time ship and get the Cosmos Stones. He eventually attacks the Spectral Space Pirates with his Cryolophosaurus after this. After a battle with the D-Team, he manages to get the Cosmos Stones before Jark reclaims them and forms the Black Pterosaur. Seth ended up unconscious after ramming the Backlander into the Black Pterosaur. His comatose body taken back to the future with Rex and the Alpha Gang. ; : :: Helga serves as a strict and very short-tempered housekeeper of the Alpha Gang. Sometimes she seems too large and too strong to be a human. It is later revealed that she is actually a robot created by Dr. Z when the D-Team encounter her again in Cambodia and even protects Laura and Rod from the Stegosaurus. When in Chinatown to reclaim Laura and Rod, Seth ends up deactivating Helga causing Zeta Point to end up a mess without her. She was retrieved when her body ended up in Hollywood, but with bad programming. When Seth turns on the Alpha Gang, Helga holds off the Saurophaganax enough for Dr. Z, Ursula, Zander, Ed, and Rod to escape. She was later repaired by Jonathan and later ends up accompanying the D-Team and the Alpha Gang in fighting the Spectral Space Pirates. Helga was the one who discovered that the Gel-Jarks have a weakness to salt. ; Alpha Droids : :: Obedient robots that work for the Alpha Gang which are so poorly programmed that they fail at everything they do. The most common model of Alpha Droid is the Actroid which can curl up into balls for easy transportation. In \\"Field of Screams,\\" it is shown that the Alpha Droids can become dizzy as seen when they end up bunched up into one soccer ball. They make more appearances in the original series, but are seen occasionally in the Pterosaur Legends (especially during the Caribbean and at the finale). The Nintendo DS video game introduces the Kakutoroid model Alpha Droid. They are muscular, strong and red in color as they are strong enough to throw dinosaurs around. They are usually tougher to beat than the Actroids. =Spectral Space Pirates= The are the antagonists of the second series. They are a group of space pirates composed by the strange aliens with retractable wings who use dinosaur cards that have somehow obtained to aid in their search for the arcane \\"Cosmos Stones,\\" using a mind-control device to control the dinosaurs. Each one has their own Dino-Card Activator. Its members are: ; : : :: The leader and captain of the Spectral Space Pirates. He uses dinosaurs to collect the Cosmos Stone. Spectre is the one who supplies his henchmen with the dinosaur cards, Move Cards, and Spectral Armor Cards. Spectre is often seen with a small Apatosaurus named Brontykins in his arm. He is a horrible singer. ; : :: Gavro is a large and strong red-skinned simple-minded alien. His Dino-Card Activator is on his chest armor and his altered dinosaur was Gigas the Tyrannosaurus. ; : :: Foolscap is a slender alien who ponders agility. His Dino-Card Activator is on his headband and his altered dinosaur was Armatus the Stegosaurus. ; : : :: She has a beautiful semblance, but a ruthless heart. Her Dino-Card Activator is on her necklace and her altered dinosaur was Maximus the Triceratops. During the Ancient Japan arc, Sheer had amnesia and joined the kunoichi. ; Seth :: See Alpha Gang ; :: Goma is an arcade-only character. He was first a member of the Spectral Space Pirates, but is now the leader of the Shadow Kingdom. He appears after he finds the defeated Space Pirates. After discovering what had happened to his father (Spectre) and his three minions, he decides to challenge the D-Team himself. He owns an Eocarcharia, which he has altered. It is the most powerful Shadow Empire dinosaur, possessing Shadow Fire. It can be upgraded into Super Eocarcharia. This dinosaur has an Element Booster design based on Goma's outfit. ; Gel Jarks :: Obedient gel-based robots that work for the Space Pirates. They can easily transform, but they dissolve upon contact with salt. Helga was the first to discover their weakness at the time when they attacked her in the Backlander's kitchen. As of the finale, only one Gel Jark remains and is taking care of the unconscious Seth. =Supporting characters= ; : :: Aki Taylor is Max's mother and Dr. Taylor's wife. A sketchbook artist and housewife. Not much is known about Aki except that she believes (or pretends to believe) that the dinosaurs are dogs since Dr. Taylor opted to keep his wife in the dark about the truth for the time being. She often embarrasses Max with talks about when he was a baby and called him by his full name Maximus during one of these. Aki's appearances are generally brief. During the second series, she finds out what the dinosaurs really are. ; Dr. Owen : :: Dr. Owen is a paleontologist who is Dr. Taylor's colleague and Rex's adoptive father. He discovers Rex as a baby in The American Museum of Natural History and adopts him. He sends Rex to live with the Taylor family to give him a more \\"normal\\" family environment, and meanwhile seeks a woman to marry so that he can give his adoptive son a mother. He develops a crush on Ursula. In the second season, he also stays in the present with Reece, Laura, and Rod. At the end of Pterosaur Legends, he once again asks Ursula to marry him, but she replies with a \\"no.\\" ; Patrick : :: Patrick is Dr. Owen's assistant and appears since episode 30. He often travels with Dr. Owen wherever he goes and has experience in lassoing. ; : :: Jonathan is a mysterious old man with conspicuous beard. He appears all over the world, in various guises (including a pilot, a street merchant, a Balinese tour guide, a famous chef, and a train conductor) usually right where dinosaurs are found. Jonathan is eventually revealed to be a robot who can change his appearance when it came to his conductor duty. He had data that had Dr. Ancient's data which ended up extracted by Seth. Jonathan manages to save the D-Team from a deflected attack from Terry during his fight with the Ampelosaurus. The D-Team had his body shipped to the D-Lab and Reece was able to reactivate him. Jonathan makes his way to Zeta Point and by the time the D-Team arrived with Rod, Jonathan managed to expose Seth's plot. Following Seth's Saurophaganax defeating the dinosaurs of the D-Team and the Alpha Gang, Jonathan managed to rescue Rex. Near the end of the first series, Jonathan revealed himself to be Dr. Ancient's butler who was charged with protecting Rex and even brought up the history of what the Alpha Gang did. He reappears in the second season as the pilot of the Backlander. ; Mr. and Mrs. Drake : Mr. Drake : Mrs. Drake :: They are Zoe's parents and they run a veterinarian clinic. They, along with Mr. and Mrs. Ancient and Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, are abducted by the Spectral Space Pirates in the second season. ; Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia : Dr. Ancient : Dr. Cretacia :: Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia are scientists who are Rex's real parents. They were the ones who have discovered a way to turn dinosaurs into cards. Dr. Ancient was displeased that Dr. Z created Move Cards for them. When Dr. Cretacia became pregnant, they wanted to return. However, Dr. Z and Seth had other plans. They ended up jettisoning Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia's pods into the timestream and tried to do the same to baby Rex. They were somehow recovered as they were in the pod room following Black Tyrannosaurus' defeat. Dr. Ancient and Dr. Cretacia were reunited with their son. In the second season, they alongside the Taylors and the Drakes were captured by Zanjark so that the Ancients can help them with their experiment. =Minor characters= ; Tommy K : :: The host of the \\"Gobble Gobble Brain Bobble\\" quiz show. He later appears as the host of the trivia game on the 4Kids Dinosaur King website. ; Nathan Deckham : :: Nathan Peckham is a parody of football player David Beckham. Zoe and Reese both have a crush on him. ; Amy : Amy / Umi :: A girl who is very timid, though very fond of reptiles. Amy has never had any friends until she met Euoplocephalus. Later she finds a lizard and keeps it as a pet, naming it Euoploc (Hannah the Third in the English Dub). ; Michelle : :: Max, Rex, and Zoe's teacher. ; Mary :: Mary is a park ranger who is a member of the Wildlife Protection Team (or WPT for short) and protects the wildlife in the Kenya Reserve by tracking down poachers. She was an old friend of Spike Taylor as both of them had a hobby at lassoing. When Max, Rex, and Zoe arrive in Kenya, they end up running into the rangers led by Mary who suspects that they are associated with the poacher Ungaro. A transmission from Spike ends up revealing to the D-Team that he knows Mary. Following the transmission, Mary agrees to help the D-Team find the Torosaurus while stopping Ungaro. When the D-Team's dinosaurs were able to defeat the Alpha Gang, Mary manages to lasso Ungaro. Afterwards, she and her fellow rangers managed to free ; Ungaro : :: Ungaro is a notorious poacher. He and his gang have been poaching animals in the Kenya Reserve and have been evading the Wildlife Protection Team. Ungaro had an encounter with Ursula, Zandar, and Ed who helped them out at the time when they were looking for the Torosaurus. During the Alpha Gang's fight with the D-Team and the Torosaurus, Mary managed to lasso Ungaro who surrendered. When Paris envoked a stampede that chased after Ursula, Zander, and Ed, Ungaro got trampled and quoted \\"Mom was right! I should've became a plumber!\\" ; Meena : :: Meena is an Indian princess who befriends and swims alongside the Deltadromeus. ; Sophia / Sylvia : :: A girl who the D-Team befriends in Ancient Rome. She came from the town of Trachia which was invaded by the Roman Army sent to attack any who resisted. Her brother Spartacus was among those rounded up and made into a slave. The D-Team helps her free Spartacus from Lucius Cornelius Sulla. ; Spartacus : :: Sophia's brother who is a prisoner of Sulla after he tried to get the slaves to stand up to Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Because of this, he ended up a gladiator at the Colosseum. While Lucius was distracted with the fight between the D-Team and Sheer, Spartacus and Sophia freed the other slaves and escaped. ; Lucius Cornelius Sulla : :: Lucius Cornelius Sulla is a politician of Rome. He sent his army to Trachia to attack anyone who resists him. Some of its civilians were captured and sold as slaves. Spartacus was one of them since he tried to get the slaves to stand up to him. He even planned to eliminate Spartacus by either having him fight lions or the entire Roman Army. Sulla does managed to get Ursula, Zander, and Ed to have Spiny fight Spartacus (who had received the Cosmo Stone to power up his sword) until Sheer comes into view. The D-Team arrived and fought Sheer enough to distract Sulla from noticing Spartacus and Sophia escaping to free the slaves. ; Jim / Jimmy : :: A boy encountered in the Age of Pirates, trying to get a map stolen by Blackbeard so he could get the Cosmos Stone to save his village from an unmentioned plight. Jimmy and his father were attacked by Blackbeard's pirates and the British Military (who thought Jim and his dad are with Blackbeard). When his dad ends up captured, he helps the D-Team out. He was reunited with his father who was in the company of the British Military. ; Blackbeard : :: A pirate whom the D-Team encounter in the Caribbean Sea Arc. He aids the Spectral Space Pirates in their quest for the blue Cosmos Stone and has a pet parrot. After his ship was wrecked, Blackbeard and his crew were arrested by the British Military alongside their double agent who agreed to testify against him. ; Copper : :: A pirate who serves as Blackbeard's apprentice and second-in-command. ; Sansho Hoshi / Shwan-dzang : :: A monk who the D-Team encounter in China's Tang Dynasty. He thinks chanting is the answer to all of life's problems. Whether this really works is unknown. Zanjark abducted him from his village in a plot to get to that time period's Cosmos Stone. The D-Team think Genzo might have had something to do with Tank breaking the rock. Dr. Z and Ursula pretend to be him a couple of times with disastrous results. ; Ieyasu Tokugawa : :: A sh≈çgun that the D-Team encounter in the Edo period.

After his ordination to priesthood, he was sent to University of Rostock (rector of which was then David Chytraeus).See entry of Ercius Erici in the Rostock Matrikelportal After his studies he became 1578 headmaster of the school in G√§vle. 1583 he was consecrated as bishop together with Petrus Benedicti of Link√∂ping, Nicolaus Stephani of V√§xj√∂, and Christian Agricola of Tallinn with catholic ceremonies of the liturgy of John III. Soon after their episcopal consecration, these bishops had to sign a commitment to new Church Order (Nova Ordinantia), king John's liturgy, medieval tradition of church music and to use of some specific episcopal ceremonies, in addition to emphasis on study of Church Fathers. This was part of the Liturgical Struggle. King John even planned sending Sorolainen to Constantinople for ecumenical dialogue with Orthodox Church. This dialogue was already formerly initiated by T√ºbingen theologians with Patriarch Jeremias II of Constantinople. Later in Synod of Uppsala (1593), bishop Sorolainen together with Bishop Olaus Stephani Bellinus made secretly Calvinist Duke Charles his enemy by initiative of banning Calvinism in Sweden, which was decided by the synod. When Duke Charles became Regent, after his War against Sigismund, son of his brother John III, he used his opportunity to revenge to Bishop Sorolainen by imprisoning him for alleged \\"popery\\", which was although annulled by Diet of Lingk√∂ping. 1609 King Charles seems to have forgotten his earlier anger and distrust to Sorolainen. Sorolainen was also a noted writer, publishing his first work in 1614. He translated into Finnish the service book of 1614, wrote a large catechism (1614). Between 1621 and 1625 he published a book of sermons in Stockholm entitled Postilla.

History In July 2005, The Get Up Kids split up, leaving the members to pursue their own side-projects. This allowed guitarist Jim Suptic to devote his full attention to his new band Blackpool Lights, composed of himself and former members of Butterglory and The Creature Comforts. Rather than accepting an offer from Vagrant Records to sign the band, Suptic decided that he wanted to start over from scratch, and in doing so, created Curb Appeal Records. Suptic co-founded the label with Al Duffy, a Kansas City entrepreneur who had previously run a beer distributor, Enrique Chi, a publicist who had worked with Vedera and Reggie and the Full Effect, and Alex Brahl, who had previously worked at Vagrant Records, in addition to having produced The Get Up Kids' second album, Something to Write Home About.Kansas City - Music - Lookin' Good In the summer of 2006, the label released their first album, Blackpool Lights' This Town's Disaster.

Life John FitzGerald was a Carmelite friar and priest of Irish parentage, brought up in England, who learned Welsh and made it the language of his religious, intellectual and social life. He was born Michael FitzGerald in Ludlow, Shropshire in 1927 to parents from County Kerry and spent his childhood in Chesterfield and Sheffield. At the age of 13, he was sent as a boarder to Coleg Mair, a small Catholic seminary housed in Castell Brychan, Aberystwyth where he was taught Welsh by Saunders Lewis, the dramatist and poet who had lost his lecturer's post at University College, Swansea, following an act of arson at an RAF bombing school that was under construction. FitzGerald remained in close touch with Lewis until the latter's death in 1985, dedicating his first book of poetry \\"i SL am agor drws a ffenestri\\", \\"to SL for opening a door and windows\\". He published two volumes of verse, Cadwyn Cenedl (\\"A nation's chain\\", 1969) and Grawn Gwirionedd (\\"Grapes of truth\\", 2006). The second contains all the poems in the first as well as about 30 others and was longlisted for the Welsh Assembly's Literature Prize in 2007. Many of his poems are devotional but he also found inspiration in the nature, people and music. In his obituary in The Independent, Meic Stephens highlights a poem \\"I'm gwraig\\" where he purports to address his \\"wife\\" although he concludes his poem \\"Perhaps I should note that I'm not married\\". According to Meic Stephens, he had 'a talent for writing verse of a very high order'. In 1942 he joined the Carmelite Order as a novice taking the name John and made his first profession of his religious vows in 1943. He then began higher level studies with the Carmelites in Ireland where he remained until 1948, At University College, Dublin, he began by reading Welsh in the department headed by John Lloyd-Jones who advised him to switch to Greek and Latin and he graduated with a first in Classics in 1946. FitzGerald studied in Dublin for another four years and was ordained priest in 1951. This was followed by a year studying Theology in Rome and a further three reading Classics at Christ's College, Cambridge. He returned to live in Wales in 1956 and was appointed to the staff of Coleg Mair (by then moved to Tre-gib in Carmarthenshire). Although he had already written poems in English, he now turned to Welsh, working with the Carmarthenshire dialect and mastering the intricate rules of Welsh prosody. After three years the college was moved to Cheltenham, but FitzGerald remained in Tre-gib until 1964. He was then appointed Chaplain to Catholic students at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and six years later to a lectureship in the Department of Philosophy. When the Philosophy Department at Aberystwyth was closed in 1993 he ceased to teach through the medium of English although continuing to teach Philosophy in the Department of Welsh. In 2004, with the closure of their community in Aberystwyth, the Carmelite Order moved him to the post of Prior of Llanelli. He was the major force in translating the Latin Mass into the Welsh vernacular following the Second Vatican Council. In 1998 he was also a member of the ecumenical panel which produced a new translation of the Bible into Welsh. In addition to Welsh, John FitzGerald learnt Irish and Basque. He translated from Greek both ancient and modern, including Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics and poems by Sappho and Cavafy. In literary circles he was known as 'Ieuan Hir' and at 6\\" 4' (195 cm) he towered over any company. His vows meant that he owned only the most modest of cars and in later years a frequent sight in Aberystwyth was his giant frame implausibly squeezed into the smallest model on the market.

UNMIK authorities have criticized Serbia organizing elections saying only the UN can organize elections in Kosovo. Kosovo's President Fatmir Sejdiu accused Serbia of trying to challenge Kosovo's statehood. There is a total of 115,712 registered voters and they were able to vote in 295 voting places. There are 157 voting places in Central Serbia and Vojvodina, and each of the seven major Montenegrin cities has one, for refugees from Kosovo.  Background  Serbia's elections in Kosovo follow the unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian leadership in Kosovo, a declaration that Serbia considers illegal. This proposal for what many observers have called a de facto partition was said to be in response to unrest in Northern Kosovo and other Kosovo Serb areas. Establishment of Serb institutions in Kosovo is part of the \\"functional division\\" of Kosovo proposed by the Serbian government.  Dispute over elections  UNMIK considers the holding of local elections in Serbia without its agreement as invalid and as a breach of UNSCR 1244.B92 - News - Politics - Ruecker: Local elections won't be valid It has, however, proposed to hold local elections in the mostly Serb-populated municipalities of Leposaviƒá, Zubin Potok, ≈†trpce, Zveƒçan and Novo Brdo, where the 2007 local elections were declared invalid due to the Serb voters' boycott; however, UNMIK insisted that it would have to organise the elections there, not Serbia, and that the date would likely not be 11 May 2008. UNMIK has no problem with the participation of Kosovo Serbs in the parliamentary election.B92 - News - Politics - UNMIK approves elections, but not on May 11 However, on 14 April 2008 the Election Commission announced it would hold local elections in Serb areas of Kosovo; internally displaced persons, whether living in Kosovo or not, will be able to vote as if they were living in the municipality from which they were displaced.B92 - News - Politics - Belgrade makes Kosovo vote decision official Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samard≈æiƒá subsequently called on Joachim R√ºcker to sanction the elections.B92 - News - Politics - Samard≈æiƒá calls on UNMIK to sanction local elections UNMIK spokesman Alexander Ivanko reiterated that UNMIK would view all elections held without its approval as illegal and in breach of UNSCR 1244.B92 - News - Politics - UNMIK remains unmoved over elections On April 18, 2008 Joachim Ruecker, the Chief of UNMIK, said the elections would cross a ‚Äúred line‚Äù if organized by Serbia. The International Steering Group for Kosovo has expressed its support for the UNMIK position saying it opposes the \\"institutional separation by ethnic lines\\" in Kosovo. Kosovo's Assembly adopted a statement condemning Serbia‚Äôs plans to hold local elections in Kosovo and showing support for the position taken by UNMIK and President Fatmir Sejdiu. However, Kosovo police authorities have said they would not interrupt voting to prevent local elections. UNMIK declared the local Serb elections held in Kosovo in May 2008 null and void.  Kosovo Serb Institutions  Marko Jak≈°iƒá, a Kosovo Serb political leader and ally of then- Prime Minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica, said Kosovo Serbs would form their own assembly following the elections. He argued that the Kosovo Assembly was dominated by \\"Albanian puppets\\" who would not work in the interest of the Serb minority. Following the elections Samard≈æiƒá outlined the makeup of the Kosovo Serb institutions consisting of municipal assemblies and executive councils. According to Samard≈æiƒá municipal governments will act in keeping with the Serbian constitution and resolve all problems independently or in agreement with Belgrade. UNMIK officials have said they will continue working with appointed Serb leaders declaring the local elections \\"illegal\\" and pledging not to negotiate with the elected officials. Yves de Kermabon, head of the EULEX mission to Kosovo, said he was \\"willing to talk to everybody\\" including officials elected on May 11, stressing that he would go to Northern Kosovo as soon as he found people there willing to talk. Kermabon said his reason was that he does not want the EU to be \\"forcibly deployed\\" there. The mayor of Mitrovica condemned the formation of a parallel municipal assembly in North Mitrovica by Serbs following the election saying the institution was \\"illegal\\" as well as the elections. On June 13, 2008 a parallel assembly with 30 members, the majority from the Serbian Radical Party, was formed for Pristina with the first session being held in a warehouse due to a lack of space. Radovan Nicic was elected president of the municipality by the assembly. Another assembly was formed in Obilic north of Pristina the same morning. Serbian parties (SRS, DSS, SPS, NS and DS) agreed to form a parliament for Kosovo Serbs including 45 delegates, 43 from the local assemblies and two seats reserved for Romani and Muslims. Slobodan Samard≈æiƒá announced that the Kosovo Serb assembly would be formed on June 28. He said the body would be representative not executive. The parliament shall only be transitional before direct elections. The parliament was officially scheduled on 16 June 2008 to be held in Pri≈°tina on 28 June 2008, symbolically on Saint Vitus' Day. Its official name shall be The Assembly of the Community of Municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohia. The parliamentary majority has been formed by the Democratic Party of Serbia, Serbian Radical Party, Socialist Party of Serbia and Civic Initiative of Gora. The opposition Democratic Party supports its constitution, but will for now boycott it. The cause of restoration of parliamentarism since 1999 was specifically stated as a reaction to the recently put in act Constitution of Kosovo and will only officialize the two separate systems which were already in act for years. It is pointed out that it is the representative body of Kosovar citizens loyal to the Republic of Serbia.  Results  The turnout of registered voters was at 57%. Serbian Radical Party came first in 15 municipalities, the DSS has the most councilors in six, as well as various citizens' lists. The Radicals and DSS formed a coalition in the Assembly of the Community of Municipalities of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. 2013 Brussels Deal As part of the 2013 Brussels deal all aspects of this election were repudiated and invalidated by Serbia.

He was born in Siderno on the Ionian coast of Calabria and was the capobastone (head of command) of the ndrine in his hometown. Criminal career Antonio Macr√¨ was one of the most powerful bosses belonging to the 'old guard'. In Siderno he was well known as the true authority in his town. In 1929 he was charged with illegal firearms, in 1932 for grievous bodily harm, in 1945 for robbery with violence, in 1947 for attempted murder and in 1958 for murder with aggravating circumstances.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 20 Macr√¨ held the position of capo crimine from the beginning of the 1960s until the outbreak of the first 'Ndrangheta war in 1975. Together with Domenico Mico Tripodo, the boss of the city of Reggio Calabria and the surrounding areas, and Girolamo Mommo Piromalli, head of the most powerful 'ndrina on the Tyrrhenian coast, he formed a sort of triumvirate, whose senior position was recognized by all other family chiefs and whose advice was in most cases followed without protest.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 60 He also had close relations with the Sicilian Mafia, in particular with Michele Navarra, at the time the capomafia of Corleone, when Navarra was banished by the Italian authorities to Gioiosa Marina in Calabria in the 1950s. E ora la ‚Äôndrangheta supera cosa nostra: Intervista a Enzo Ciconte, Polizia e democrazia, November‚ÄìDecember 2007 Later he counted Luciano Liggio, Salvatore and Angelo La Barbera, Pietro Torretta and the Grecos among his friends. Gratteri & Nicaso, Fratelli di Sangue, p.55 Macr√¨ was involved in expanding the local 'Ndrangheta internationally, in particular Canada and Australia. He urged Michele (Mike) Racco, who had been initiated to the local 'ndrina and moved to Canada in the early 1950s, to set up an organisation in Canada. Different clans originally from Siderno formed what has been called the Siderno Group by Canadian law enforcement authorities.Myths, Legends, and Affiliation Practices in the Italian Mafioso Imagery: the Local Dimension of Power of a Global Phenomenon, by Ercole Giap Parini, paper prepared for the European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) at the Conference in Marburg, 2003 Tradition and modernization Macr√¨ opposed new criminal activities such as kidnappings and drug trafficking. However, several cosche of Plat√¨, San Luca, and the Gioia Tauro plain did engage in these activities and Macr√¨ had no means by which to prevent or punish these violations of the traditional mafia code. (Both the crimine and its charismatic leaders depended on the consensus and cooperation of the individual 'Ndrangheta families and relied on the good will of single family bosses to have the codes obeyed). Nevertheless, Macr√¨ also was an proponent of modernization, representing a qualitative step in expanding traditional parasitic criminal activities of extortion to a more entrepreneurial phase. When in 1974, businesses, involved in the expansion of the port and steelworks in Gioia Tauro, offered a three per cent kickback to be left in peace, the three leading 'Ndrangheta families at the time, Macr√¨, the Piromalli brothers and the De Stefano brothers, rejected the offer and wanted to be sub-contracted on work carried out in order to control the projects.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 106 Nevertheless, the growing tensions among 'Ndrangheta clans reached a boiling point at the meeting to discuss the deal. Tripodi and his former underling Giorgio De Stefano exchanged insults that almost escalated in a violent confrontation, only just prevented by peacemaker Macr√¨.Dickie, Mafia Republic: Italy's Criminal Curse, pp. 137-40 Death Macr√¨ was a traditional 'Ndrangheta capobastone who, together with Tripodo, opposed new developments in the organisation such as the formation of the Santa, a secret society within the 'Ndrangheta established in the early 1970s to maximize the power and invisibility of the most important bosses. L‚Äôatteggiarsi delle associazioni mafiose sulla base delle esperienze processuali acquisite: la ‚Äôndrangheta , by Salvatore Boemi, in I delitti di criminalit√† organizzata, Quaderni del Consiglio Superiore della Magistratura N. 99 The disagreement led to bloodshed in the so-called First 'Ndrangheta war. On January 20, 1975, Macr√¨ was killed in his hometown Siderno, while his right-hand man Francesco Commisso was severely wounded. Gratteri & Nicaso, Fratelli di Sangue, p.58 His death triggered the 'Ndrangheta war that cost some 300 lives. According to a state witness, one of his 'executioners' was a young Pasquale Condello, an ally of Macr√¨'s main foe, the De Stefano 'ndrina.Godfather's arrest fuels fear of bloody conflict, The Observer, February 24, 2008 Macr√¨ may have paid for his opposition to kidnappings and drug trafficking with his life, as his murder was presumably organized by the supporters of a change of modus operandi of the 'Ndrangheta.

Ins. Orth. 179 commonly known as the large brown mantis (also known as the Bunny Mantis or Australian ghost hopper Mantis ) is a species of mantid native to Australia. The large brown mantis has two subspecies, a widespread subspecies and the stick mantis ghost from Bundabergs Turtle Sands. The stick mantis ghosts are not as aggressive as the widespread species but have a defense display used to make the mantis appear larger by flinging its front legs into the air and putting its head down along with its antennae. Large brown mantids are light brown with short winged female and a long winged male. The subspecies from Bundaberg is a pale cream white with a yellow and black eye in between the arms (one and a half times the size of the widespread subspecies). The large brown mantis female is short winged - her wings reach only half her abdomen and she is not able to fly‚Äîbut the long winged male has wings that cover the entire abdomen. They have two pairs of wings - the top pair are the wing covers and the bottom wings enable the mantis to fly. Behavior These large brown mantids are aggressive as adults and are known to attack large prey, such as small birds, and rarely, fish, frogs, and lizards. The large brown mantids are cannibalistic and are known to attack humans defensively if disturbed or not handled properly. They can also jump a short distance from a perched spot to escape enemies. A stick mantis ghost in defense pose Reproduction The male stick mantis is smaller than the female and is about 90 mm long and can fly; the female cannot fly and is about 110 mm long. Reproduction occurs when the male injects a single sperm at a time and can last up to half an hour. When mating, the male ejaculates on the female with a miniature penis which is then inserted into a tiny opening at the female's posterior. The male clips its abdomen to the female's egg holding compartment and then the male inserts a single sperm at a time.

Ryan Matthew Church (born October 14, 1978) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder. He played for the Montreal Expos /Washington Nationals, New York Mets, Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Arizona Diamondbacks. Career =Minors= Drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 14th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft, Church signed June 7, 2000, after graduation from the University of Nevada, Reno. By January , he was traded by the Indians with Maicer Izturis to the Montreal Expos for Scott Stewart. =Montreal Expos / Washington Nationals= Church made his major league debut for the Expos in August 2004, struggling in the 30 games he played in the last two months of the season. He ended the season with a .187 batting average. After struggling in the first month of the season Church was considered a candidate for the Rookie of the Year Award, until he injured himself running into the outfield wall at PNC Park on June 22, 2005. At the time of the incident, Church was batting .325 with a .544 slugging percentage. After the incident, Church made two trips to the disabled list and was unable to match his hitting performance from the first half of the season. In , Church was demoted to Triple-A New Orleans after struggling early in the year. However, Church was sent back to the majors on July 23, and ended up hitting .276 with a career best 10 home runs and .892 OPS. His 10 home runs in just 196 at-bats in 2006 projects to around 30 home runs for an entire season. In , Church had career highs in games (144), at bats (470), runs (57), hits (128), doubles (43), home runs (15), and RBI (70). He finished the year batting .272, slugging .464 and a .813 OPS. =New York Mets= After the 2007 season, Church was mentioned in trade talks, with the Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and Minnesota Twins all reportedly interested in his services. However, on November 30, 2007, Church was traded, along with Brian Schneider, to the New York Mets for Lastings Milledge. In spring training , Church was involved in a collision with first baseman Marlon Anderson that resulted in a Grade 2 concussion for Church. He recovered without any serious injuries. On May 20, 2008, Church suffered a minor concussion while sliding into Atlanta Braves shortstop Yunel Escobar. It appeared as though when Church initially slid, his head made contact with Escobar's right knee. After Church struck his head, he slid about eight feet past second base with his forehead dragging on the dirt. Church made his return to the starting lineup on June 1, 2008, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, collecting three hits including a home run and a double. However, he was placed on the disabled list with aftereffects of the concussion. On September 3, Church had his second career grand slam, off Dave Bush. On September 28, Church made the final out in Shea Stadium history in a 4‚Äì2 Mets loss. =Atlanta Braves= On July 10, 2009, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Jeff Francoeur,Mets trade OF Church to Braves for OF Francoeur but was designated for assignment on December 8, 2009 in order to make room for the return of Rafael Soriano. On December 12, 2009, the Braves decided to non-tender Church, making him a free agent. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On January 11, 2010, Church agreed to a deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On July 31, 2010, Church, Bobby Crosby and D. J. Carrasco were traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Chris Snyder and Pedro Ciriaco. He was non-tendered following the 2010 season, despite a .265/.345/.490 line in 55 plate appearances with the Diamondbacks. Controversy In 2005, the Nationals suspended Jon Moeller, a volunteer chaplain, and issued an apology after Church, a devout Christian, revealed conversations he had with him about a Jewish former girlfriend. Church told the Washington Post that the chaplain nodded when he asked whether Jews were \\"doomed\\" because they \\"don't believe in Jesus.\\" After Jewish community leaders complained, Church issued a statement saying, \\"I am not the type of person who would call into question the religious beliefs of others.\\" References ;Notes External links : Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Akron Aeros players Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Arizona Diamondbacks players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:Baseball players from California Category:Binghamton Mets players Category:Brooklyn Cyclones players Category:Columbus RedStixx players Category:Edmonton Trappers players Category:Gulf Coast Mets players Category:Harrisburg Senators players Category:Kinston Indians players Category:Mahoning Valley Scrappers players Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:Montreal Expos players Category:New Orleans Zephyrs players Category:New York Mets players Category:Nevada Wolf Pack baseball players Category:People from Lompoc, California Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Sportspeople from Atlanta Category:Washington Nationals players ","title":"Ryan Church"},{"id":"16698938","text":"Edward McSweegan Ph.D., is an American microbiologist, science writer and fiction author. Education and early research McSweegan earned his undergraduate biology degree from Boston College in 1978. He went on to earn two degrees in microbiology, a masters degree from the University of New Hampshire and a Ph.D. from the University of Rhode Island. In 1984, McSweegan received a resident research associateship from the National Research Council, and he performed postdoctoral research at the Naval Medical Research Institute. He published research on the disease-causing mechanisms of the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Career From 1986-1988, McSweegan was stationed at the State Department as an American Association for the Advancement of Science diplomacy fellow. At the State Department, he was involved in developing a science and technology pact between the United States and Poland. He helped negotiate additional agreements with Hungary and the former Soviet Union. In 1988, McSweegan joined the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and eventually rose to the rank of program officer for Lyme disease. Beginning in 1995, he denounced on the Internet what he felt was unscientific and incorrect information about Lyme disease which was being disseminated by the NIH. He criticized the Lyme Disease Foundation for putting out \\"wacko\\" theories about the disease. The NIH removed him from his post as Lyme disease program officer and transferred his research grants to other workers. The NIH later stripped him of his post in an unrelated program and transferred those grants as well. The NIH said it reassigned him to a post as director of the U.S.-Indo Vaccine Action Program. McSweegan told the Washington Post in 2003 that he didn't know he was director of that program, and was instead assigned tasks better suited for an intern. McSweegan continued to criticize the NIH positions on Lyme disease, and the NIH suspended him for two weeks in 1997, the first step in firing him. However, the NIH's own lawyers felt there was no basis for firing him. The Lyme Disease Foundation later sued McSweegan for slander, but lost. McSweegan won a countersuit against them. Through the process, he has continued to receive positive job reviews. Reports by the Post and CBS News led Senator Chuck Grassley, then the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to demand that the NIH give McSweegan work. In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, Grassley questioned the NIH's uses of taxpayer money, saying it was unacceptable for the NIH to \\"come rattling a tin cup asking for more money\\" when it was forcing taxpayers to \\"pay for full-time novelists.\\" The NIH promised to investigate the allegations.FederalDaily.com > FederalDaily Top Stories McSweegan commented on public health issues in addition to Lyme disease. In 2004, McSweegan suggested that the mysterious \\"English sweating sickness\\" may have been an outbreak of anthrax poisoning. He hypothesized that the victims could have been infected with anthrax spores present in raw wool or infected animal carcasses, and he suggested exhuming the victims for testing.Riddle solved? - 17 January 2004 - New Scientist He has also criticized the Centers for Disease Control for investigating Morgellons, a proposed infectious condition whose existence is disputed by current scientific consensus. Mcsweegan was detailed by the NIH to the Global Virus Network, where he became a program manager. He worked at the Global Virus Network until 2018.

Design and development The PWS-1 was the first design of the Podlaska Wytw√≥rnia Samolot√≥w (Podlasie Aircraft Factory), and the second aircraft designed and built in Poland, after the CWL WZ-X. It was conceived as a single-engine high-wing two-seat fighter, a main purpose of which was the escorting of bombers. Design work was carried in 1926 by Zbys≈Çaw Cio≈Çkosz and Aleksander Grzƒôdzielski, under direction of Stanis≈Çaw Cywi≈Ñski. After static tests, the prototype first flew on 25 April 1927 in Bia≈Ça Podlaska. Tests revealed poor manoeuvrability, its speed was also low due to a thick wing, despite STOL capability. In 1928 the aircraft was reworked, receiving a new, lighter, straight wing of thinner profile and duralumin construction instead of a wooden, slightly swept one. It also received an enormous vertical stabilizer of rectangular shape with rounded top. After modifications it was flown in early 1929, under a designation PWS-1bis. Its performance improved, but because of its relatively low speed compared to other fighters, its primary role was changed to reconnaissance. Development was however discontinued, because it had little payload, and in a meantime Poland had bought large numbers of better Breguet 19 and Potez 25 reconnaissance and bomber aircraft.  Description  PWS-1bis High-wing parasol braced monoplane of mixed construction, with single engine.

Chester's stepfather ran General Motors's Fisher Body Works. He began his career as a sideman under Irving Aaronson, Ben Bernie, and Ben Pollack. He formed his own group in Detroit in 1939, with a Glenn Miller-influenced sound. This band was unsuccessful in local engagements and quickly dissolved. He then put together a new band on the East Coast under the direction of Tommy Dorsey and with arrangements by David Rose. This ensemble fared much better, recording for Bluebird Records. Chester's group, billed \\"The New Sensation of the Nation,\\" had its own radio show on CBS briefly in the fall of 1939. The twenty-five-minute program aired from the Hotel Van Cleve in Dayton, Ohio late on Thursday nights (actually 12:30 am Friday morning, Eastern Time); the September 21, 1939 edition can be heard on the famous One Day In Radio tapes, archived by Washington D.C. station WJSV. Chester's Bluebird records have proved excellent sellers, both for retail dealers and coin phonograph operators such as \\"From Maine to California\\"; \\"Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie\\"; \\"Madeliaine\\"; and two songs from \\"Banjo Eyes\\" - \\"Not a Care in the World\\" and \\"A Nickel to My Name\\".Billboard February 21, 1942 His only national hit was \\"With the Wind and the Rain in Your Hair\\" (b/w \\"I Walk With Music\\"; Bluebird 10614), which featured Dolores O'Neill on vocals and went to #18 on the charts in April 1940. Chester's orchestra included trumpeters Alec Fila, Nick Travis, Lou Mucci, and Conrad Gozzo, saxophonists Herbie Steward and Peanuts Hucko, drummer Irv Kluger, and trombonist Bill Harris. His female singers included Dolores O'Neill, Kathleen Lane, and Betty Bradley; among his male singers were Gene Howard, Bill Darnell, Joe Harris, Stu Brayton, Hall Stewart, Peter Marshall, Bob Haymes, and Al Stuart. The orchestra disbanded in the mid-1940s, due in part to the shrinking market for big band sound.

The play premiered on Broadway in 1960 and was nominated for six Tony Awards, including Best Play. Vidal adapted it into a film with the same title in 1964. Lee Tracy, playing Art Hockstader, repeated his performance in the 1964 film adaptation. Productions The play opened on Broadway at the Morosco Theatre on March 31, 1960, and ran for 520 performances before closing on July 8, 1961. The play starred Melvyn Douglas (William Russell) and Frank Lovejoy (Joseph Cantwell). On October 2, 1962, Lovejoy died of a heart attack in his sleep at his residence in New York City. Lovejoy and his wife, Joan Banks, had been appearing in a New Jersey production of the play. A revival opened on Broadway at the Virginia Theatre in September 2000, and closed on Dec 31, 2000 after 121 performances and 15 previews. Directed by Ethan McSweeny, the play starred Elizabeth Ashley, Charles Durning, Christine Ebersole, Spalding Gray, Michael Learned, Chris Noth, Mark Blum, Jonathan Hadary and Jordan Lage.Brantley, Ben. \\"Theater Review: A Timeless Morality Tale Cloaked in Politics\\" The New York Times, September 18, 2000 A revival opened on Broadway at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on March 6, 2012 in previews and officially on April 1, 2012,Haun, Harry. \\"Playbill On Opening Night: Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man' Pins the Tale\\" Playbill.com, April 2, 2012 in a limited run. The play was originally scheduled to close on July 1, 2012 but has extended to September 9, 2012. The cast stars James Earl Jones (as former President Art Hockstader), Angela Lansbury, John Larroquette (as candidate William Russell), Candice Bergen, Eric McCormack (as candidate Senator Joseph Cantwell), Jefferson Mays, Michael McKean, Fred Parker Jr. and Kerry Butler, with direction by Michael Wilson.

John Stamos, Cybill Shepherd, Kristin Davis, and Elizabeth Ashley took over the roles originally held by McCormack, Bergen, Butler, and Lansbury in July 2012. Angelica Page played Catherine (secretary and mistress to Larroquette's William Russell) before assuming the lead role of Alice Russell when Cybill Shepherd unexpectedly left the show. In 2017 acclaimed stage and TV actor Martin Shaw starred as Russell in the UK premier and tour of the play, with Jack Shepherd, Gemma Jones, Glynis Barber, Honeysuckle Weeks and Jeff Fahey as Cantrell. The production received favourable reviews and its relevance to modern political machinations was commented on in the light of the 2016 US presidential election. Plot At the Presidential primaries in the summer of 1960 in Philadelphia, Secretary of State William Russell lives by his principles, but is haunted by recent health problems that threaten his career and vote-winning potential. Senator Joe Cantwell presents himself as the people's candidate; his determination to win at all costs is also his great flaw. Cantwell is faced with the revelation of sexual indiscretions, threatening both his marriage and his career. These two frontrunners for their party's presidential nomination fight for the support of the outgoing president and resort to mudslinging in a very public contest. Political association At the time, it was widely recognized that the play was written as a deliberate parallel of the upcoming 1960 Democratic Convention. The play also seemed to be a scathing attack on the Kennedys whom Vidal detestedVidal's biographer, Fred Kaplan, contests this interpretation, however. See Kaplan (1993), p.464 e.g. and also something of a tribute to Adlai Stevenson whom Vidal admired and supported. The principal characters in the play represent Vidal's then view of the main players in the Democratic Party, only with different names. Vidal's main character and hero, the very patrician and intellectual William Russell, is an homage to Adlai Stevenson. The other character the despicable Senator Joe Cantwell represent Vidal's view of Kennedy, as well as Richard Nixon (whom Vidal also detested,) Joseph McCarthy and Estes Kefauver, all of whom‚Äîlike Cantwell‚Äîrose to national prominence via publicity-seeking Senate investigative committees. (Cantwell even specifically mentions hearings into the Mafia, similar to those in which Kefauver and both Kennedys had participated.) The rumors of homosexuality in Joe Cantwell's past also parallel rumors about Joe McCarthy. Joe Cantwell campaigns on the need to close \\"The Missile Gap\\" with the USSR, which was a major Kennedy campaign claim (which was completely fictional; despite Sputnik, in terms of strategic missiles the US was well ahead of the Soviets at the time). In an ironic and prophetic similarity to Nixon, Cantwell has secretly decided to open relations with Red China if elected, while playing up his anti-Communism in public.

In 1968, he was engaged by the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, where he sang for four and a half years in the chorus and in small principal roles. In 1973, Conroy-Ward joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in the chorus and also understudied John Reed in the principal comedian roles.

He was also given the principal comic role of Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance.

During a 1978 U.S. tour, the San Francisco Bay Area Reporter wrote, \\"James Conroy- Ward... handled the role of Major General Stanley in Pirates better than anyone I can remember.\\"Bay Area Reporter, June 22, 1978 Beginning in 1973, as Reed's understudy, he appeared frequently in all of the principal comic roles:Gaiety, p. 23. Conroy-Ward said that he often did a show per week for Reed, in addition to General Stanley, to give Reed a day off, but that he rarely went on as Bunthorne, since that was Reed's favourite role. J.

In 1979, after the D'Oyly Carte company toured Australia and New Zealand,Wilson, p. 209 Reed left the company, and Conroy-Ward inherited the principal comic roles, except that he yielded the roles of General Stanley and Robin Oakapple to his understudy Alistair Donkin.Donkin has stated that Conroy-Ward \\"suffered considerable ill health so I was playing all the patter roles ... more often than he did. See Patter magazine, Vol. 2, Issue 2, p. 4, Winter 2012, International Gilbert and Sullivan Association. He continued as the principal comedian of D'Oyly Carte until it closed in 1982, after which he joined a music publishing company. Conroy-Ward said of the last years of the company, \\"I think we could have had better producers [stage directors]. I think if we'd had a few more of the Anthony Beschs coming in a little bit earlier I don't think any harm would have been done.\\"Gaiety, p. 21 Recordings Conroy-Ward participated in four recordings with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. In 1976, he sang the Herald in The Grand Duke and Lord Dramaleigh in Utopia, Limited. In 1977, he sang the role of Antonio and also spoke the role of Annibale in The Gondoliers.

The game is a city-building game where players are governor of a province and must build and maintain a thriving and prosperous settlement. The game takes place during the time of the Roman Empire. Players build Roman towers, gates, and bridges and use currency to fund projects. The Italian and Spanish versions of the game are titled as Imperivm: Civitas II. Gameplay Imperium Romanum is a sequel to a game released in 2006 by the same developer, Glory of the Roman Empire. Imperium Romanum features significantly improved graphics than its predecessor, and also adds several big Roman monuments such as the Circus Maximus and the Colosseum. The game doesn't necessarily have a 'campaign' mode like some other city-building games, but instead has the player play through different scenarios such as life in the chaos of Pompeii under the terror of Mount Vesuvius. Along with maintaining cities, the players must also keep them very well-organized and keep money spread out among the people. If there are cases of extreme poverty, then the people of the city may turn to lives of crime, which has a number of negative effects on the city. The game features full 3D structures and people and allow the player to zoom in and out of the scene as well as rotate the camera around a full 360 degrees. While much of the game is focused on building and maintaining cities, there are some RTS elements when opposing cities and civilization do battle with the player's. Along with building fortified walls and towers around the cities to prevent enemy attacks, players may also build objects such as trebuchets to go on the offensive against opposing nations.
