It was founded in 2013 by Ronny Thorsen, once the symphonic black metal band Trail of Tears was separated.  History  After almost two decades of to exist Trail of Tears, the differences between some of its surviving members had become unsustainable; in consequence, they decided to go their own way in early 2013, prior to the release of their seventh studio album Oscillation. Viper Solfa came some months later in the same year, as an idea of the lead singer Ronny Thorsen, who wanted a somewhat different project he had done so far, with a more aggressive sound and focused on gothic black metal and power metal. Thorsen quickly gathered his former colleagues in Trail of Tears: bassist Endre Moe (formerly Dimension F3H and Cutthroat), and drummer Bj√∏rn Dugstad R√∏nnow (Sphere). Thorsen asked to join at the prominent singer and multi-instrumentalist \\"Morfeus\\" (Krister Dreyer), who was already known for his work in other Norwegian bands such as Mayhem, Limbonic Art and Dimension F3H. Morfeus accepted and immediately took the role of main songwriter and the interpretation of the guitar, keyboards and orchestration. With the material at hand, it became clear that the sound needed a female voice; after a hearing with more than two dozen singers from around the world, they elected the Norwegian soprano Miriam \\"Sphinx\\" Renv√•g of the avant-garde metal band Ram-Zet as the last piece of the group. Therefore, Viper Solfa has a line-up composed of consolidated and recognized musicians in vast musical genres.Current And Former Members Of TRAIL OF TEARS, MAYHEM, RAM-ZET, DIMENSION F3H Join Forces In VIPER SOLFA Almost a year after it was established, they signed a contract with the German independent record label Massacre Records and recorded between May and July 2014 in Transient Lab (mostly).

Tahmineh Monzavi () is an Iranian photographer. Her works have been exhibited in museums in several countries, and published by international art magazines and books. She received the Sheed Award in 2011.  Biography  Monzavi received a bachelor's degree in photography from Azad Art & Architecture University of Tehran. In 2005, she began her professional career as a documentary photographer, with a focus on social issues. In 2009, she made a long documentary film about a group of addicted women who live in a shelter in south of Tehran. She follows the younger generation of Iranian society to document the social conflicts among them. In 2011 she received the prestigious Sheed Award, an independent, non- profit, private photography award. This award is given to a social documentary photographer each year, and is the only Iranian photography competition to have internationally qualified members. Her works have also been published in several international art magazines and books such as Internazionale, the British Journal of Photography, Le Figaro, L'oeil de la photographie, Alternatives History, La photographie Iranienne, and the exhibition Iran unedited history 1960-2014 published by Muse D'Art Moderne de la ville de Paris. Her photographs have also been exhibited in several museums around the world, such as the Modern Art Museum of the City of Paris, and the Literature museum of Georgia. In the series called \\"The brides of Mokhber alDowleh,\\" Monzavi told the story of works of art done by a group of men. This series has been shown in Silkroad art Gallery in Tehran, as well as in Paris, Rome, Vienna, Boston and South Korea. She has also done a project on Transsexualism, which addresses how a minority within traditional Iranian society yearns for and attempts to find wider social acceptance and recognition. Monzavi‚Äôs vision was changed after a month of being imprisoned; she began looking at Iranian society differently. After a year of inactivity, she began to work on a project called \\"All about me; nicknamed Queen maker\\" in which she covers deep feelings of womanhood and womanly dreams. Tahmineh Monzavi is also known for the length of her projects. Since the beginning of her career, she has worked on her subject matters over a long period of time. She believes the time gives her the opportunity to observe the details of a topic, and time to evaluate what happens around the subject matter. She is currently working on a long interval project of photo stories about the younger generation and women of Iran, as well as in various cities in Afghanistan.

It covers women from all walks of life, including athletes, actresses, saints, singers and queens. Background 100 Great Welsh Women was written by Terry Breverton and published in 2001. Breverton is a historian who has written more than 20 books. The Welsh Books Council has named five of his books \\"Welsh Book of the Month\\". The books are typically on subjects related to Wales and include 100 Great Welshmen, An A-Z of Wales and the Welsh, The Secret Vale of Glamorgan and The Book of Welsh Saints. Content and style The book opens with a biography of the 5th‚Äì6th century Saint Almedha and ends with the 19th century Jane Williams. The book includes biographies of Tracy Edwards, yachtswoman, who in 1997 traveled in four days across the Atlantic with a 10-woman crew; Petula Clark, the popular singer; Megan Lloyd George, the politician and feminist; Queen Elizabeth I of England; Bette Davis, the film star; Saint Claudia; Saint Darerca and the famous Queen Boudica, who led British resistance against the Romans. Other biographies include the singers Charlotte Church and Shirley Bassey; the athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson; Nell Gwyn, the mistress of Charles II; Saint Helena, mother of Constantine the Great; and the actress Catherine Zeta-Jones. Also covered are Kylie Minogue, Nest ferch Rhys, George Eliot, Sarah Siddons, Si√¢n Phillips, Laura Ashley, Mary Quant, Myrna Loy and Esther Williams. The book is carefully researched and well written. The selection of subjects is somewhat idiosyncratic, and readers may disagree with the author's choice. For example, Breverton states that he chose to exclude Margaret Roberts, better known as Margaret Thatcher, due to his dislike of that famous Prime Minister's policies. Publication 100 Great Welsh Women was published as a paperback by Glyndwr Publishing, St. Athan, in November 2001. It has 304 pages, and includes 72 black-and-white photographs. As of 2016 it was out of print. Reception The book gained attention in the media mainly because it included the Australian pop star Kylie Minogue. Meic Stephens wrote of 100 Great Welshmen and 100 Great Welsh Women in the Western Mail Magazine on 16 March 2002, \\"These are not necessarily books that you want to read from cover to cover, but to browse in ... Both are really extraordinary achievements by a single author whose industry and enterprise seem to show no bounds.\\" Norma Penfold of the Welsh Books Council wrote, \\"All in all, 100 Great Welsh Women is an informative reference book as well as a fascinating read.\\" Jonathan Hourigan wrote in the Sunday Express, \\"Breverton's breadth, generosity and sheer enthusiasm about Wales are compelling.\\" According to Dr Peter N. Williams, \\"The book is an absolute must for all those who value their Welsh heritage, and for all those who wish to see Welsh women accorded their rightful place in history.\\" Notes Sources    * Category:2001 books Category:Welsh books Category:Biographies (books) ","title":"100 Great Welsh Women"},{"id":"49289057","title":"2015‚Äì16 ISU Speed Skating World Cup ‚Äì World Cup 3 ‚Äì Women's 3000 metres"},{"id":"49289072","text":"Warin de Munchensy was a Anglo-Norman nobleman in 12th century England.

Also referred to as a \\"six pointer\\" The Antler is a cocktail, generally served in a shot glass, made up of two parts Fireball to one part Sour Apple Pucker. It is the unofficial shot of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, created by fans to consume both pregame as good luck and post-game in celebration of victory. The Sour Apple Pucker tints the drink green, which is the primary color of the Bucks. It originated at Bar None on Water Street in Milwaukee, though its popularity is growing among more bars in the Milwaukee area.  Ordering  Besides asking the bartender for your desired number of Antlers, you are also able to order the shots nonverbally. Once you have the attention of the bartender, possibly by making deer noises from across the bar, simply bring your hands to your head, and denote the number of shots you want by holding up the same number of fingers as if your fingers were deer antlers. For example, if you wanted six shots, as in the accompanying picture, you could hold up three fingers with each hand.  Largest Antler Order  The current record for largest order is a 16 pointer on Friday March 2, 2018. The previous record was at 14 pointer, ordered on the night of the Bucks' season opener of their 2016-2017 season.

It was to have a major impact on his career. Background Crosby had appeared on radio on many occasions as a member of The Rhythm Boys trio, first as part of the Paul Whiteman orchestra and later in the nightly broadcasts with Gus Arnheim from the Cocoanut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. It was at the Cocoanut Grove that Bing's solos made him stand out from the Rhythm Boys and a dispute with the management at the Grove more or less led to the break-up of the trio in May 1931. Bing had already started making records under his own name and then he made several short films for Mack Sennett which were well received. A regular nationwide radio broadcast show was the next logical step in the development of his solo career. Bing and his attorney, Roger Marchetti, traveled from Los Angeles to New York seeking $1,500 a week on sustaining time and $3,000 a week if and when a sponsor was found. As Bill Paley, CEO of CBS, wrote; \\"It was an astounding price at the time, in fact an outrage, but I did not want to lose him. I negotiated as hard as I could, but we finally settled for his asking price. . . . What made Bing Crosby's first contract with CBS so extravagant was that he came to our network as new or developing talent, just as had Morton Downey, Kate Smith, the Mills Brothers, and others, to be put on the air on a sustaining basis; that is, without advertiser support. Under this new contract policy, we usually paid such talent a little over $100 a week, or at most $500 a week, until we could find a sponsor.\\" Variety announced the news on August 25, 1931 and touched on an ongoing problem with the musicians' union following the dispute with the Cocoanut Grove. \\"With CBS, Crosby will receive around $1,500 a week, from accounts, although in the east he is still an unknown on the radio. The Ambassador hotel contract which he broke would have paid him $250. According to the musicians' union ruling, Crosby can perform with union accompaniment anywhere but in Los Angeles. In that city he is barred from any amusement places that are considered opposition to Gus Arnheim at the Ambassador.\\" Much publicity heralded the planned debut of 15 Minutes with Bing Crosby on August 31, 1931 but after rehearsing all that afternoon at the CBS HQ at 484 Madison Avenue, Bing was unable to go ahead with the six nights-a-week show at 11 p.m. The next night Bing did not appear either and rumors started to circulate that he was either drunk or too nervous to sing. Finally on Wednesday September 2, came the answer. Rehearsing in air- conditioned rooms had given him laryngitis. Starting at 11 p.m. that night, Bing completed his first solo radio show with Eddie Lang playing guitar and with an orchestra conducted by Victor Young. He sang \\"Just One More Chance,\\" \\"I Found a Million Dollar Baby,\\" and \\"I'm Through with Love.\\" The opening theme played by the orchestra was \\"Too Late\\" and the sheet music of this song quickly stated that it was from Fifteen Minutes of Bing Crosby. Reception The Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News commented: \\"So far as Southern California goes, Amos 'n' Andy listenage has been sadly cut, what with Bing Crosby back on the old air at the same time. Despite two false starts early in the week, due to bad case of laryngitis, Crosby has come back strong and is his old self again...\\" Variety made some suggestions. \\"When Crosby first came to town, WABC had him warbling around 10:30 or 11 at night. This hour was soon discarded for the more important period of 7 p.m. . . Getting an earful of Crosby over a series of programs doesn't leave much doubt that he's not entirely at ease when delivering an unfamiliar song. . .If he can work out a schedule allowing him the same preparation for radio as for recording, he's a cinch for ether popularity.\\" The nationwide shows continued daily (except Sundays) on a sustaining basis until October 31, 1931 from station WABC in New York. Harry Von Zell was the announcer. Freddie Rich led the orchestra after the first week. Russ Columbo was broadcasting for NBC at 11:30 p.m. each night as competition for Bing with Variety noting \\"Scrap between NBC & CBS over Russ Columbo and Bing Crosby is getting warm.\\" Crosby's popularity soon attracted a sponsor - the American Tobacco Company - and rather than Lucky Strike cigarettes, the company's president, George Washington Hill, chose to promote another of the company's products, Cremo Cigars. Bing Crosby ‚Äì The Cremo Singer Starting on November 3, 1931, Crosby became The Cremo Singer which broadcast from CBS station WABC (studio 8) in New York between 7:15 and 7:30 p.m. six nights a week (not Sundays) until February 27, 1932. David Ross was the announcer and Carl Fenton conducted the orchestra. A further broadcast was made at 11:00 p.m. each night for the West Coast audiences. \\"Where the Blue of the Night\\" was chosen as Bing's radio theme song. The show had a Co-operative Analysis of Broadcasting rating of 6.9 compared with Amos 'n' Andy (38.1), Rudy Vallee (24.7) and Paul Whiteman (19.1). The ratings were known as Crossleys, named after Archibald Crossley, the man who conducted them. Variety heard one of the shows on November 9 and reported: \\"Certified Cremo Cigar Company must have stepped high to corral Bing Crosby, the rage of the radio hour, for their WABC broadcast. But, judging by his work, he's worth it‚Ä¶ On the air Monday night he used, 'Now That You're Gone', 'Then She's Mine' (sic) and 'Goodnight, Sweetheart'. All these he threw off in the manner that has brought him forward so fast in the favor of the public. It is highly individual, belongs to him alone and he need stand in no fear of competition, because, while he may have imitators, there will be only one Bing Crosby.\\" Saturday, February 27, 1932, marked Crosby's last appearance as the Cremo Singer as the sponsor abruptly cancelled the show which puzzled CBS President Bill Paley for a couple of years until he received an explanation. It seems that the Cremo cigar was heavily advertised and sold as a machine-made cigar, which supposedly had a big advantage over the handmade variety because no worker's saliva would touch the cigar wrapper in making the cigar. However, sales of the cigar went so well that the production manager had to augment the machine-made cigars with some of the hand-made variety. He had not told his superiors about this and when the company president eventually found out, he cancelled the radio show because his advertising would have been shown to be untrue. The singer then reverted to broadcasting on a sustained basis. 15 Minutes with Bing Crosby unsponsored radio show (March 8 ‚Äì July 15, 1932, CBS) On March 8, 1932, Crosby commenced evening radio shows on three nights a week for CBS on station WABC, on a sustaining basis, with Freddie Rich's Orchestra. The first week the shows aired on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday in the 6:30‚Äì6:45 p.m. time slot before switching to a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday format. In April Crosby embarked on a tour of Paramount-Publix theatres, working across the country to Hollywood where he was to make the film The Big Broadcast. At each location, he continued to broadcast his show until he reached the West Coast. On July 12, Variety carried a review of Bing's radio show. \\"With a new corking musical background, Bing Crosby was at his best over WABC from a Hollywood pickup. . .\\" Soon afterwards Crosby's contract expired on July 15 and he and CBS could not agree on the new one which apparently would have imposed a 35 percent pay cut on him. Crosby did not return to the air until January 1933. Chesterfield Cigarettes Presents \\"Music That Satisfies\\" (also known as Chesterfield Time) After almost seven months off the air, Bing Crosby started a new radio program called Chesterfield Cigarettes Presents \\"Music That Satisfies\\" on CBS, originating from station WABC in New York. The \\"Music That Satisfies\\" series had begun in the fall of 1932 with Arthur Tracy, Ruth Etting and Alexander Gray appearing on different nights of the week accompanied by Nat Shilkret and his Orchestra. Norman Brokenshire was the announcer. Sponsored by Chesterfield Cigarettes, the show was re-launched in January 1933 and broadcast each night (except Sundays) from WABC New York, at 9 - 9.15 pm EST with Crosby appearing on Wednesdays and Saturdays. On other nights, Ruth Etting (Mondays and Thursdays) and Tom Howard and George Shelton (Tuesdays and Fridays) were featured. Jane Froman replaced Howard and Shelton on February 21. The show came from New York with Norman Brokenshire again acting as announcer and Lennie Hayton conducting the orchestra. Eddie Lang accompanied Crosby, who used \\"Just an Echo\\" as his closing theme song. Crosby's contract paid him $2000 a week for 13 weeks and he made his bow on January 4. Variety liked it saying, \\". . .As far as this quarter hour is concerned, it is highly palatable stuff, if not particularly distinguished. Crosby and Hayton are both adept but the presentation is quite formula featuring Crosby in three and a half songs not counting the 'Please' vamp-in.\\" thumb Eddie Lang had a chronically inflamed sore throat and had felt ill for a year or eighteen months. Crosby persuaded Lang to see a doctor and the doctor advised a tonsillectomy. Unfortunately Lang did not come out from under the general anaesthetic and he died on March 26, 1933. Crosby had to leave for Hollywood after his appearance on the show on March 29 to make College Humor for Paramount Pictures. The film studio agreed to pay the line charges figure of around $1800 a week and for the band (another $2300 weekly) for the balance of Crosby's contract with Chesterfield which ran until April 15, 1933. Paul Douglas was the announcer for the Hollywood based show with Raymond Paige becoming conductor. After the April 15 program the show was discontinued for the summer.

Commentary on the early 20th century  In The Behavior of Crowds (1920), his first nationally reviewed book, he posed what he saw as the dilemma of the modern age: a technological information revolution that made it possible, in the absence of an adequate educational system, to influence ignorant men and women with propaganda and half-truths. Unscrupulous demagogues, corrupt politicians, manipulative advertisers, and revolutionary ideologues found ready-made audiences when they appealed to the baser (a subconscious urge, behavior, or intuition directed by primeval, animalistic, self-serving, and/or ignoble motivations) instincts.Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult educationhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf Martin was a classical, individualistic liberal, in the tradition of the Renaissance humanists and the authors of The Federalist Papers.

Martin was an instructor and lecturer at The New School for Social Research in New York City from 1921 to 1929, and served on the board of directors of The New School from 1925 to 1932.http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/ He taught classes in sociology, psychology, social behavior, and adult education.http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/ At The New School, Martin taught alongside other prominent intellectuals of the day including, Alfred Adler, Norman Angell, Harry Elmer Barnes, Charles Austin Beard, Edwin Grant Conklin, Herbert J. Davenport, John Dewey, Lawrence K. Frank, Felix Frankfurter, Alexander Goldenweiser, Joseph Jastrow, Alvin Saunders Johnson, Horace Kallen, Alfred Kreymborg, Eduard C.

Apparently Martin's wholehearted commitment to liberal education has placed him in juxtaposition with the early proponents of practical education in the eyes of contemporary scholars. Here is an individual virtually dismissed not only in the history of adult education, but also in the contemporary exploration of adult education.‚ÄùSteven B.

The purpose of the club is to offer an informal venue in which members can confidentially share their opinion and ideas on different scientific and medical topics. Members include scientists who are working or have actively worked in medical research, in academic and biomedical research institutions or in biotech, largely, but not exclusively within the London-Oxford-Cambridge research triangle. Members of the club, many of whom are within the early years of their independent scientific career, meet five times per calendar year in different venues in London. Three guest speakers are invited by members to present their most recent work and these presentations offer the starting point for an open scientific discussion. Speakers may later be invited to join the club.  History  = Foundation = The foundation date of the London Medical Research Club coincides with that of the first recorded meeting on 1 July 1891.Wellcome Trust Library Archives: Medical Research Club Minutes 1891-1937 - SA/MRC/1/1 The meeting took place in the Theatre of the Conjoint Laboratories on the Victoria Embankment, and was attended by 15 people: Sims Woodhead (chair), Sidney Martin (provisional secretary), Edward Emanuel Klein, Victor Alexander Haden Horsley, William Dobinson Halliburton, Charles Smart Roy, Marc Amand Ruffer, Samuel George Shattock, Charles Sherrington, John Sutton, Frederick Walker Mott, John Wickenford Washbourn, Almroth Edward Wright, Charles Alfred Ballance, and William Hunter. It was during this meeting that the motion to found a Medical Research Club was presented and carried forward. A provisional list of rules had already been produced by an interim committee, and was reviewed by the members present at the first meeting. The second, third and fourth meetings of the club (on 8, 15 and 22 July 1891) focused on further discussion of the rules, which were finally considered point by point and approved at the fifth meeting (28 October 1891). The first ordinary meeting of the Medical Research Club was held on Wednesday 18 November 1891, when the first two scientific papers were presented: \\"The Influence of the Kidney on Tissue Metabolism\\" by John Rose Bradford; and \\"Concurrent Infection\\" by Edward Emanuel Klein. = Original rules and notable changesWellcome Trust Library Archives: The History of the Medical Research Club 1891-1991, ed. L.H. Collier 1992 - SA/MRC/4 = Below are some of the 31 original Rules, as first printed in 1891: 1\\\\. This Society is called the Medical Research Club. 2\\\\. The objects of the Club are the discussion, and, as far as possible, the demonstration of original work in General and Special Pathological Science, excluding purely clinical observation. 3\\\\. The Club shall consist of not more than thirty-five members, all of whom shall be actively engaged in medical research. 4\\\\. All communications to the Club shall be absolutely private. Any member who shall publish an account of the proceedings of the Club, shall, ipso facto, cease to be a member of the Club. 11\\\\. A book shall be kept in which the qualifications of candidates for election shall be stated by the proposers. 12\\\\. The election of new members shall take place annually at the meeting in October. 13\\\\. At least seven days before the date of election, the Secretary shall send to each member a printed list of the candidates for election. 14\\\\. The election shall be by ballot. 19\\\\. The meetings of the Club shall take place six times annually, in October, November, February, March, May and June. 21\\\\. The meetings shall take place on Wednesdays and at 8.30pm. 23\\\\. At each meeting, one of the members shall, on the motion of the Secretary, be elected to act as Chairman. 24\\\\. The Chairman shall direct the business of the meeting. 25\\\\. All members shall at the meetings sign their name in an attendance book specially kept for that purpose. 26\\\\. Each member may introduce one visitor, whose name shall be sent to the Secretary and announced at the meeting. The member shall be responsible for the observance of the rules by the visitor introduced by him. The rules of the club have undergone several changes throughout the years, in wording, substance or numbering. Nonetheless, the nature and objectives of the club have not changed, and remain clearly stated in the latest fully revised version of the rules (November 2010). The original rules 1 and 2 are now combined in rule 1: ‚ÄúThis Society shall be called the MEDICAL RESEARCH CLUB. The objectives of the Club shall be primarily social, and include demonstration of original work in General and Special Pathological Science, and the discussion of the same, excluding purely clinical observations.‚Äù The maximum number of Ordinary Members has progressively increased, and different types of membership are accepted, as stated in rule 2: ‚ÄúThe Club shall consist of Honorary, Senior, Ordinary and Non-resident Members. There shall not be more than 100 Ordinary Members, all of whom shall be actively engaged in research‚Äù. The process for the election of new Ordinary Members, as defined in the original Rules 11-14, formally remains similar in the current version of the rules. However, nowadays under rule 13 ‚ÄúEvery candidate whose name is submitted for election to the Club shall previously have read a paper before the Club, and have been supported by the signatures of two members of the Club.‚Äù In addition, rule 15 (‚ÄúThe election shall be by ballot. [‚Ä¶]‚Äù), is accompanied by a note stating that ‚ÄúIn 2009, it has become accepted practice that 10 members‚Äô signatures lead to election of a candidate to membership once the ordinary memberships fall below the maximum memberships‚Äô number. [‚Ä¶]‚Äù The time limit for scientific communications was a subject of debate during the first years of the Club. Rule 24 states that ‚ÄúNo communication to the Club shall occupy more than 15 minutes in delivery [‚Ä¶]. The Chairman shall read this rule at the beginning of each meeting and shall enforce it.‚Äù The main point that ‚ÄúAll communications to the Club shall be absolutely private [‚Ä¶]‚Äù (original rule 4) has been retained in rule 25 of the current list, but a note added in 1934 clarifies that ‚Äúthis rule was never intended to be a secrecy rule. Its prime objective was to enable members to bring forward for discussion unpublished work without incurring the risk of having their results prematurely broadcast. Reading a paper before the Club does not constitute publication. [‚Ä¶]‚Äù = Notable facts and meetings = The Medical Research Club has held regular meetings since it was founded, with the exception of two periods of interruption coinciding with the two World Wars. The time and location of the meetings have changed over the years, but they have maintained their nature of informal gatherings in which scientific and medical topics are discussed among colleagues and are often accompanied by dinner. By 1892, the club was already known outside the United Kingdom, and was invited by the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France to send two representatives to the celebrations for the seventieth birthday of Pasteur, on 27 December 1892. Two members of the club were also present at the commemoration of the fiftieth year of the founding of the Pasteur Institute in Paris (15 March 1939). Sir Almroth Wright gave his first presentation to the club in 1892, discussing alterations to the blood in haemophilia. Wright has been one of the most prominent members of the club since its foundation, and gave numerous communications over the years. In 1946 the club sent a congratulatory letter to Sir Almroth Wright on occasion of his 85th birthday and of the 50th anniversary of the publication of his method for prophylactic inoculation against typhoid fever. Two of the most notable communications to the club were given by Alexander Fleming. In December 1921, Fleming first presented his discovery of lysozyme; then on 13 February 1929 he presented a paper entitled \\"A medium for the isolation of Pfeiffer's bacillus\\", in which he described his discovery of penicillin, and its ability to inhibit the growth of gram- positive bacteria. Fleming suggested that penicillin could have been used to isolate gram-negative bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae, which are resistant to the antibiotic. Minutes from the meeting indicate that this communication did not elicit any discussion. On 14 June 1933, the paper \\"Propagation in ferrets of a virus obtained from influenza patients\\" by Wilson Smith, Christopher Andrewes, and Patrick Laidlaw provided the first demonstration of the presence of a virus in human influenza. The first woman to be invited as a visitor and speaker to the club was Harriet Chick in 1909 and 1911. However, the first woman to be elected as an ordinary member was Dorothy Russell, in November 1947. Between 1967 and 1969, the club agreed that one meeting each year could be devoted to a specific topic, presented by a distinguished invited speaker in one single lecture lasting 45 minutes. Peter Medawar gave a lecture entitled ‚ÄúAnti-lymphocyte serum‚Äù in May 1967; Henry Harris discussed ‚ÄúThe expression of genetic information: a study in a hybrid cell‚Äù in 1968; and William Hayes presented 'The bacterial chromosome' in 1969. Although members of the club received the lectures with enthusiasm, these mono-thematic meetings did not continue in subsequent years. Alick Isaacs presented three papers in 1958, 1961 and 1966 describing his work on interferon-alpha, a natural anti-viral molecule that is of major scientific and medical interest. In 1970, Yvonne Cossart illustrated the relation between hepatitis and the Australia antigen, now known as the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus. Several members of the Medical Research Club have received honours and prominent positions for their contributions to science and medicine. Eight members have been awarded the Nobel Prize, and nineteen current members are Fellows of the Royal Society.  Medical Research Club members who were awarded the Nobel Prize  * 1929 - Medicine and Physiology: Frederick Gowland Hopkins (with Christiaan Eijkman), for the discovery of vitamins. * 1932 - Medicine and Physiology: Charles Scott Sherrington (with Edgar Douglas Adrian), for his discoveries on the functions of neurons * 1936 - Medicine and Physiology: Henry Hallett Dale (with Otto Loewi), for his discoveries relating to chemical transmission of nerve impulses * 1945 - Medicine and Physiology: Alexander Fleming, Ernst Boris Chain, Howard Walter Florey, for the discovery of penicillin and its curative effect in various infectious diseases * 2001 - Medicine and Physiology: Tim Hunt (with Leland H. Hartwell and Paul M. Nurse), for the discovery of key regulators of the cell cycle. * 2015 - Chemistry: Tomas Lindahl (with Paul Modrich and Aziz Sancar), for mechanistic studies of DNA repair.

The meetings are held on Wednesdays, namely the second Wednesday of the month, in February, March, May, October and November. Many of the members who regularly attend the meetings are young, active scientists and clinicians in the early years of their independent research careers; 35 new ordinary members have been elected since 2011. Members are encouraged to bring guests, who are invited to join in the discussions. Guests must abide by the rules of the club, under their host‚Äôs responsibility. The location is often, but not always, within the research institution in London where the chairman of the meeting works. The meetings are preceded by a social gathering of approximately 30 minutes during which members can introduce their guests to other members. In the meeting proper, the chairman reads the minutes from the previous meeting, then welcomes the members and announces the names of the guests for the evening. Before introducing the speakers, the chairman reads rule 24 to the audience, to remind the speakers of the 15 minute time limit. Three scientific communications are given by the invited speakers, who then become candidates for membership, and the presentation is opened for discussion. The scientific presentations are followed by a dinner in a restaurant, which provides more opportunities for members and guests to interact. = Membership = During the meeting, members and guests are asked to confirm their presence by signing the attendance book. A nomination book is also circulated during the meeting with the name of each candidate for membership on each page. Members only (not guests) have the opportunity to support a candidate by signing the relevant page of the nomination book. At the annual general meeting, which is usually held in November, a motion is made for the candidates who have received 10 nominations to be invited to join the club, and the page with their name is removed from the nomination book. = Types of membership = There are four types of members of the Medical Research Club: Honorary, Senior, Ordinary, and Non-resident. Ordinary Members are elected when, after having presented a paper in front of the club, they receive nominations from 10 current members. The number of Ordinary Members is limited to 100, and all Ordinary Members must be actively involved in bio-medical research and reside or work within a radius of 12 miles from Charing Cross. An Ordinary Member who has retired from the club may be elected as an Honorary Member. Election must be supported by at least four-fifths of the members present at the annual general meeting. Ordinary Members can become Senior Members if their membership has lasted uninterruptedly for twenty years, or when they reach sixty years of age. An Ordinary Member who has served at least one year and resides or is engaged in research work outside the 12 mile radius from Charing Cross can become a Non- Resident Member. = Members = As of January 2016, the London Medical Research Club counts 83 Ordinary, 31 Senior, 45 Non-Resident (32 Ordinary and 13 Senior) and 1 Honorary Member, representing a total of 21 research institutions, including academia, government and industry. = Governance = Governance of the club is via an executive committee, led by ‚ÄòThe Club Secretary‚Äô (renamed ‚ÄòThe Chair‚Äô of the Medical Research Club in 2014), the Treasurer and six members of the club (who consider club governance and support the chair and treasurer). Each member of the executive committee is nominated and voted annually the annual general meeting.

Its primary goals, as stated in its prospectus, were (1) to collect the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, both printed and in manuscript, and all works related to him, his family, or his music; and (2) the furtherance and promotion of a general acquaintance with his music by its public performance. The original committee of management consisted of William Sterndale Bennett (founder and chairman), R. Barnett, G. Cooper, F. R. Cox, J. H. B. Dando, W. Dorrell, W. H. Holmes, Edward John Hopkins, Charles Edward Horsley, John Hullah, H. J. Lincoln, O. May, and Henry Smart, with Sir George Smart and Cipriani Potter as auditors, and Charles Steggall as honorary secretary. The Society was dissolved on 21 March 1870. Their library of music was passed to the Royal Academy of Music and in 1984 the Committee papers were donated by the Sterndale Bennett family to the library of Royal College of Music Performances Under the auspices of the society, the first performance in England of the St Matthew Passion took place at the Hanover Square Rooms on 6 April 1854, Sterndale Bennett conducting. The principal female vocalists were Mme. Ferrari, Misses B. Street, Charlotte Sainton-Dolby, Dianelli, and Freeman; the principal male vocalists were Allen, Walworth, W. Bolton, and Signor Ferrari. Mr. W. Thomas was principal violin, Mr. Grattan Cooke first oboe, and Edward John Hopkins was at the organ, the new instrument by Gray and Davison being used on this occasion for the first time. The English version of the words was by Miss Helen F. H. Johnston. A second performance was given at St Martin's Hall on 23 March 1858, Sterndale Bennett again conducting. The audience on this occasion included Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Another performance was given in 1862, coinciding with the publication of Bennett's own edition of the work, with a translation of the text into English by his pupil Helen Johnston. On 21 June 1859 the Society gave a performance of miscellaneous works by Bach, including the C minor piano concerto, the Chaconne for violin (by Joseph Joachim), and the Solo Fugue for piano in D. The concert of 1860, on 24 July, included the first eleven movements from the Mass in B minor. Three years later, on 13 June 1861, the Society gave the first performance in England of the Christmas Oratorio also under Sterndale Bennett's direction.

It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Anglo American in March 2020. History Founded in 2003, the company initially focused on exploring the potential for potash mining in North Dakota. However, after abandoning attempts at overseas exploration in February 2012 and following approval from the North York Moors National Park Authority in June 2015, the then AIM-listed company stated that it would seek financing in order to begin construction at the Woodsmith Mine in North Yorkshire. It was admitted to the main market in April 2017. In September 2019 the Woodsmith Mine project was in doubt when the company shelved a ¬£400 million junk bond sale, citing a lack of government support and Brexit uncertainty. In November 2019 the company announced that it was in talks with potential investors to raise $600 million needed to fund the first phase of the development. In January 2020 Anglo American confirmed it was considering making a bid to buy Sirius, making a 5.5p per share offer to buy the project for ¬£400m. In salvaging the financially troubled project, Anglo American envisages spending around ¬£230m to keep construction going through to at least 2022. Sirius advised shareholders that if the offer was rejected then the company could face administration within weeks. Subject to approval by at least 75% of Sirius shareholders, the deal was expected to become effective by 31 March 2020. The sale was approved by shareholders on 4 March 2020. Operations The Company‚Äôs stated focus is the development of its North Yorkshire polyhalite project which aims to exploit the world‚Äôs largest deposit of polyhalite, a type of potash. The company plans to create a mine three miles south of Whitby and an underground conveyor system to transport the mineral from the mine site to a materials handling facility at Teesside, away. The area of interest is located on the Yorkshire coast, mostly within the North York Moors National Park. The mineral seam lies below the surface, covering an area of approximately , around onshore and offshore. The company announced the material findings of the project's definitive feasibility study on 17 March 2016. In summary it proposes a framework for production capacity of 20 million tonnes per annum (\\"Mtpa\\") with initial installed capacity of 10Mtpa. This will deliver a ¬£2.3 billion annual contribution to the UK's GDP, ¬£2.5 billion of annual exports which represents a 7% decrease in the UK's trade deficit and 2,500 direct and indirect production jobs as well as over 2,000 jobs during construction.

As with pyrolytic carbon or pyrolytic graphite (PG), APG is also low in mass, is electrically conductive, and offers diamagnetic properties that allow it to levitate in magnetic fields.  Physical Properties  APG is an anisotropic material with extremely high in-plane thermal conductivity (1,700 W/m-K at room temperature \\"ALUMINUM ENCAPSULATED APG HIGH CONDUCTIVITY THERMAL DOUBLER‚Äù Scott L. Kugler, Northrop Grumman Space Technology) and low through-thickness conductivity. Its laminate structure remains stable across a wide temperature range allowing it to be used in a variety of heat transfer applications. APG's conductivity generally increases as the temperature decreases, peaking at 2,800 W/m-K at approximately 150 K. Unlike pyrolytic graphite, the x-y planar conductivity is consistent across each basal plane, thus the conductivity in the center planes is consistent with the outer planes.\\"Novel Electronics Cooling Solution Improves Power Handling of Small Packages\\" California State Polytechnic University, Power Electronics Magazine The in-plane covalently bonded carbon atoms in a hexagonal geometry account for APG‚Äôs high in-plane thermal conductivity and its high in-plane stiffness. Through its thickness, these hexagonal planes are weakly bonded (van der Waals bonds) resulting in a material with poor through-thickness thermal conductivity, stiffness, and strength.  Synthesis  APG is produced in a process similar method to Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG), where hydrocarbon gas is heated until it breaks down into carbon. Pyrolytic graphite (PG) is then grown on plates using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. The PG is then annealed at high temperature to form the more planar and more uniform carbon structure of APG, described above. The primary difference between the HOPG and APG synthesis methods is that the APG annealing process does not require the use of induced stresses, resulting in a more affordable and practical bulk material for production use.  Applications  APG is primarily used as a heat spreader for the thermal management of high-end electronics. Due to its poor mechanical properties APG is typically encapsulated within in structural metallic materials. Aluminum is the most commonly chosen encapsulant for its strength, low mass, cost, manufacturability, and thermal conductivity. Since APG's conductivity is much lower through its thickness, thermal vias are sometimes inserted into the assembly to transfer heat into the graphite, as shown in Figure 1. These vias are typically composed of aluminum or copper. Thin, flexible sheets of APG can be encapsulated in thin flexible materials, such as polymers, aluminum foil, or copper foil to create what is known as a Thermal Strap.\\"Introduction to the Physics and Chemistry of Materials\\" Robert J.

Personal life  Jud Yalkut was born in New York City in 1938. In 1973, he moved to Dayton, Ohio, where he lived until his death at the age of 75 in Cincinnati, Ohio on July 23, 2013. He was married to Peg Rice.  Career  Yalkut attended McGill University, Montreal, where he studied poetry, before returning to his place of birth, New York, to take up film- making. = New York = In 1965 Yalkut became resident film-maker for USCO ('The Company of Us', a media arts collective). Yalkut created the following films for USCO events in the mid-sixties, some in collaboration with USCO members: Turn, Turn, Turn (USCO did the soundtrack), Ghost Rev, Diffraction Film, and Down By the Riverside. Jud became interested in psychedelics, and produced a short film called D.M.T. preserved by Anthology Film Archives (http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/) In 1966 he started collaborating with Nam June Paik, a working partnership that would continue into the 1970s. Together, Yalkut and Paik produced hybrid film-video works that combined moving image technologies, electronic manipulations, performance and installation. These works include Videotape Study No. 3 (1967‚Äì69), Beatles Electroniques (1966‚Äì72) and Cinema Metaphysique (1966‚Äì72). As well as Paik, Yalkut worked with many other New York-based performance artists. For example, in 1967 he made a film of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, Kusama‚Äôs Self-Obliteration. In 1968, Yalkut collaborated with the dancer and choreographer Trisha Brown, contributing a film to the dance, Planes, for projection onto the performance space. The film included found aerial footage of New York City, rockets launching and microscopic imagery.

In the 1870s she made her way to the Montana goldfields, trading work as a nanny for transportation. She ultimately became sole owner of the Virginia City Water Company, becoming the first and only woman in Montana‚Äîand probably the nation‚Äôs only female African American‚Äîto own a utility. In 2012, the State of Montana honored her by inducting her into the Gallery of Outstanding Montanans. Childhood Other than being born into slavery, Sarah Bickford's origins are uncertain. Although some sources point to her birth in North Carolina, other historians have traced Bickford's birth to Jonesboro, Tennessee, to a mother owned by John Blair III. Blair made a fortune in the 1849 California Gold Rush and was active in politics, serving as both a state senator and a U.S. Congressman. In 1860, he owned a hotel in Knoxville, where Sarah (also known as Sallie) likely worked. Blair died in 1863; settling his estate is likely the reason that Sarah was separated from her family. Bickford told people that her parents were sold during the Civil War and that she never saw them again. After the Civil War, Sarah went to live with her aunt, Nancy Gammon, in Knoxville, and Gammon's husband, Isaac, who became the first African American alderman in Knoxville. Sarah took their last name, becoming Sarah Gammon. Life in Virginia City Advertisement for Sarah Bickford's (then Sarah Brown's) restaurant/bakery/boarding house In 1871, Sarah Gammon headed to Montana Territory, trading passage for work as a nanny. After arriving in the gold rush town of Virginia City (then the territorial capital), she worked briefly as a chambermaid at the Madison Hotel before marrying miner John Brown in 1872. The couple had three children (two boys and a girl), but the marriage was an unhappy one. Both boys died of diphtheria and in 1880, Sarah sued for divorce on the grounds of abuse and abandonment. She received full custody of her seven-year-old daughter Eva. After working briefly for French-Canadian immigrant Adaline Laurin, Sarah Gammon Brown opened her own business, the New City Bakery and Restaurant, regularly advertising in the local newspaper, the Madisonian. According to the advertisement, \\"Mrs. Sallie Brown, proprietess,\\" offered \\"board by the day or week,\\" \\"lunch and dinner at all hours,\\" \\"fresh bread, cake, pies and confectionery constantly on hand.\\" Eva Brown, Sarah's daughter, died at age 11 in 1882. A year later Sarah Brown married white miner and farmer Stephen Bickford. This marriage occurred before the state of Montana passed a law prohibiting interracial marriage in 1909. Other prominent interracial couples from the same era included the founders of the coal mining town of Belt, Montana, John and Mattie Castner.

Sarah took an active role in the business; she took a business class by correspondence and in 1890, she purchased the remaining third of the waterworks, becoming sole proprietor. She also purchased a building (known as the Hangman's Building because during its construction, Vigilantes hung five men they judged to be outlaws from the roof beam) for her office. Bickford was a hands-on manager. She visited every customer and was her own bill collector. She remained a well-respected member of the community until her death on July 19, 1931.

Although pterosaurs went extinct millions of years before humans evolved, humans have coexisted with pterosaur fossils for millennia. Before the development of paleontology as a formal science, these remains would have been interpreted through a mythological lens. Myths about thunderbirds told by the Native Americans of the modern western United States may have been influenced by observations of Pteranodon fossils. These thunderbirds were said to have warred with water monsters, which agrees well with the co-occurrence of Pteranodon and the ancient marine reptiles of the seaway over which it flew. The formal study of pterosaurs began in the late 18th century when naturalist Cosimo Alessandro Collini of Mannheim, Germany published a description of an unusual animal with long arms, each bearing an elongated finger. He recognized that this long finger could support a membrane like that of a bat wing, but because the unnamed creature was found in deposits that preserve marine life he concluded that these strange arms were used as flippers. The creature was restudied again in the very early 19th century by French anatomist Georges Cuvier, who recognized both that the creature was a reptile and that its \\"flippers\\" were wings. He called the creature the Ptero-dactyle, a name since revised to Pterodactylus. Although Cuvier's interpretation later became the consensus, it was just one of many early interpretations of the creature and its relatives, including that they were bats, strange birds, or the primordial handiwork of Satan himself. Similar animals like the long-tailed Rhamphorhynchus and Gnathosaurus were soon discovered around Europe and it became obvious that earth was once home to a diverse group of flying reptiles. The British anatomist Sir Richard Owen dubbed this vanished order the Pterosauria. Soon after, he described Britain's own first pterosaur, Dimorphodon. Later in the 19th century pterosaurs were discovered in North America as well, the first of which was a spectacular animal named Pteranodon by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. Various aspects of pterosaur biology invited controversy from the beginning. Samuel Thomas von Soemmering ignited a multi-century debate over how pterosaurs walked on the ground by suggesting they crawled on all fours like bats. August Quenstedt, by contrast, argued that they walked on their hind limbs. In the early 20th century, Hankin and Watson in the first major study of pterosaur flight biomechanics concluded that on the ground these reptiles were altogether helpless and could only scoot along on their stomachs like penguins. The debate gained steam in 1957 when William Stokes reported unusual tracks left by a four-footed animal he suspected was a pterosaur walking along the ground. In 1984, Kevin Padian, who had recently argued that pterosaurs walked on their hind legs, dismissed Stokes's tracks as those of a crocodilian. However, in the mid-1990s, Jean- Michel Mazin and others reported that fossil footprints in Crayssac, France were similar to those reported by Stokes from the US. Mazin's tracks were more obviously pterosaurian in origin and settled the debate in favor of pterosaurs walking on all fours. Pterosaur paleontology continues to progress into the 21st century. In fact, according to David Hone the early 21st century has seen more progress in pterosaur paleontology than in \\"the preceding two centuries\\" combined. He compared this transformative period in pterosaur paleontology to the Dinosaur Renaissance of the 1970s. He also observed that roughly one-third of known pterosaurs were discovered during this brief interval. One of the most notable of these was Darwinopterus, whose body resembled the more primitive long-tailed \\"rhamphorynchoids\\", while its skull resembled those of the more advanced short-tailed pterodactyloids. These traits establish the species as an important transitional form, documenting one of the most important phases of pterosaur evolution. Another important new species is Faxinalipterus minima, which might well be the world's oldest pterosaur. The first confirmed pterosaur eggs were also reported from China during the early 21st century. Prescientific * The Cheyenne people of Nebraska believed in mythical thunderbirds and water monsters that were in endless conflict with each other. The thunderbirds were said to resemble giant eagles and killed both people and animals with arrows made of lightning. People occasionally discovered stony arrowheads thought to come from the thunderbirds' arrows. According to folklorist Adrienne Mayor, these supposed arrowheads were likely fossil belemnites, which were compared to missiles by other indigenous American cultures, like the Zuni people. The fossils of the Niobrara chalk may have been influential on these stories. The pterosaur Pteranodon and marine reptiles like mosasaurs are preserved in Niobrara Chalk deposits and associated remains may have been interpreted as evidence for antagonism between immense flying animals and serpentine aquatic reptiles. Fossils of the large toothed diving bird Hesperornis are also found in the Niobrara chalk, sometimes preserved inside specimens of large predatory marine reptiles. Observations of similar fossils in the past may have been seen as further evidence for thunderbird-water monster conflict. * The Sioux people of South Dakota believed that the first creatures in creation were the insects and reptiles, who were ruled by the Water Monster Unktehi. Reptiles were very diverse and came in all shapes and sizes, but they became violent and bloodthirsty until they were petrified by lightning sent by the Thunder Birds. The physical bodies of the Thunder Beings killed by the lightning, including Unktehi, also ended up being buried. The Sioux believe that earth has a history of four distinct ages. These events occurred during the Age of Rock. This portrayal of the Thunder Birds may also have been influenced by associations of fossils of Pteranodon with marine reptiles of the same age in the western United States. 18th century Type specimen of Pterodactylus =1780s= 1784 * Cosimo Alessandro Collini, keeper of the natural history collections of Mannheim, reported the skeleton of an unusual animal to the scientific literature. It had strange arms that could have supported a membrane like that of a bat's wing, yet it was preserved in rocks characterized by fossil of marine life. Based on these associations, he tentatively concluded that the animal was aquatic. 19th century Portrait of Georges Cuvier, the naturalist who recognized pterosaurs as flying reptiles =1800s= 1801 * French anatomist Georges Cuvier restudied Collini's bizarre fossil, based on his published illustration. He reinterpreted its forelimbs as wings and deemed it a flying reptile. 1802 * The strange fossil described by Collini was moved from Mannheim to Munich. 1807 * German anatomist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach interpreted Collini's animal as a bird, specifically, as some kind of waterfowl. 1809 * Cuvier named the flying reptile reported by Collini Pt√©ro-Dactyle. =1810s= Reconstruction of a pterosaur specimen by Samuel Thomas von Soemmerring 1812 * In contrast to Cuvier and Blumenbach, Samuel Thomas von Soemmering interpreted Collini's fossil as a mammal. Specifically, he interpreted it as an unusual bat, which morphologically linked mammals with birds. He named this strange creature Ornithocephalus. Soemmering may have interpreted this series of forms in an evolutionary sense, following the early evolutionary ideas of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck. Soemmering's analysis of the specimen was blemished by anatomical errors, like the misidentifications of bones. Soemmering agreed with Cuvier that the creature was a flying insectivore, however. Soemmering argued that pterosaurs walked on all fours like bats when on the ground. His advocacy for this interpretation of pterosaur terrestrial gait has been regarded as the beginning of a multi-century debate on the subject. 1817 * Soemmering reported the discovery of a second pterosaur specimen. This second specimen was smaller than the first, with a 25 cm wingspan, and possessed a shorter snout. These traits mislead Soemmering into greater confidence in his interpretation of pterosaurs as bats. This specimen reminded him of the parti-colored bat. 1819 * Cuvier renames Pt√©ro-Dactyle into the current generic name Pterodactylus, but assigning P. longirostris (now considered a synonym of the type species P. antiquus) as the type species of the genus. =1820s= Illustration of the holotype skull of Rhamphorhynchus. 1824 * Cuvier reiterated his previous conclusions that the Ptero-Dactyle was a reptile that flew with membranous wings. He also advanced novel speculations about its paleobiology, like that it used the claws on its wings to climb trees and \\"crawled\\" quadrupedally when not in flight rather than walking on its hind limbs. c. 1825 * Paleontologist Georg Graf Munster discovered an unusual skull. He sent the fossil to Soemmering, who thought it belonged to an ancient sea bird. He also sent a cast of the skull to August Georg Goldfuss, who recognized it as a pterosaur. Goldfuss described the new species Pterodactylus muensteri based on the specimen. 1827 * Gideon Mantell discovered some fossil bones in the Wealden beds of Sussex, England that he believed were the remains of ancient birds. * Mantell recognized that his \\"bird\\" bones were actually pterosaur fossils and reported his findings to the scientific literature. These were the first Cretaceous pterosaur fossils ever described. 1829 * William Buckland described the new species Pterodactylus macronyx from the Blue Liass of the Dorset Coast of England. These were the first scientifically documented pterosaurs to be discovered outside of the Solnhofen lithographic limestone. =1830s= Pterodactylus reconstructed as an aquatic animal Pterodactylus restored using its claws to climb cliffs, as advocated by August Goldfuss and William Buckland 1830 * Carl von Theodori described the new species Pterodactylus banthensis from Franconia. * Georg Wagler argued that pterosaurs represented a distinct class of aquatic vertebrates that he called Gryphi. Like Collini, Wagler thought that pterosaurs swam underwater using their forelimbs as flippers. 1831 * August Goldfuss depicted pterosaurs as flying reptiles that used their wing claws to climb cliffs. He hypothesized that on land, they would have had to travel on all fours. He also suggested that they may have been covered in hair. 1832 * von Meyer described the new genus Rhamphocephalus. 1833 * von Meyer described the new genus and species Gnathosaurus subulatus. 1834 * Johann Jacob Kaup first referred to pterosaurs by that name. 1836 * William Buckland depicted pterosaurs as cliff-climbing winged reptiles in a manner heavily influenced by Goldfuss. 1839 * Graf Munster received a complete skeleton of \\"Pterodactylus\\" munsteri which revealed the presence of a long bony tail in this species. =1840s= The pterosaur Pterodactylus portrayed as the handiwork of Satan in the Book of the Great Sea-Dragons by Thomas Hawkins (1840) 1840 * Thomas Hawkins published The Book of the Great Sea-Dragons, wherein he suggested that the great reptiles of the Mesozoic were created by the devil. He described pterosaurs as \\"an engrafted-by-Evil stock\\" and depicted them as bat-like scavengers that combed the ancient seashore. 1842 * Sir Richard Owen formally named the order Pterosauria. 1843 * Edward Newman interpreted pterosaurs as mammals in a similar fashion to Soemmering. However, Newman specifically considered pterosaurs to be carnivorous flying marsupials. 1847 * von Meyer erected the genus Rhamphorhynchus. =1850s= 1851 * Two pterosaurs sculpted by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins were put on display in England's Crystal Palace. These were the first three-dimensional life-size restorations of pterosaurs. 1855 * von Meyer described the new genus and species Ctenochasma roemeri. Illustrated skeletal reconstruction and life restoration of Dimorphodon. 1855 * August Quenstedt described the species Pterodactylus suevicus from the Nusplingen lithographic limestone. In this publication he argued that pterosaurs would have walked bipedally on the ground. 1856 * Albert Oppel reported the discovery of a pterosaur lower jaw from the Posidonia shales of Holzmaden. This was the first pterosaur specimen to be reported from these deposits, which would go on to produce many pterosaur fossils of exceptional quality. 1859 * Sir Richard Owen erected the new genus Dimorphodon for the species \\"Pterodactylus\\" macronyx. * Buckman described a clutch of 4.5 cm long oval-shaped fossil eggs from Middle Jurassic marine rock in the United Kingdom. He erected the new oogenus and oospecies Oolithes bathonicae for them, the first time fossil eggs had been given their own unique taxonomic name. =1850s ‚Äì 1860s= 1859 ‚Äì 1860 * Meyer described 40 specimens of Pterodactylus. Among these specimens he reported more than 20 species. Most of these species are not recognized as distinct today and generally represent the misguided application of new names to members of known species at different ages. One species was not even a pterosaur; the \\"Pterodactylus\\" crassipes type specimen would later be recognized as the \\"Haarlem\\" specimen of Archaeopteryx. He also reported the presence of pterosaurs in the lithographic limestone of Cerin, France. =1860s= Type specimen of Scaphognathus crassirostris. 1860 * Andreas Wagner erected the new genus Dorygnathus for the species Pterodactylus banthensis. 1861 * Wagner described the new genus Scaphognathus for the species Pterodactylus crassirostris. 1862 * Oppel described the new species Ctenochasma gracile. He also interpreted some tracks from the Solnhofen lithographic limestone as pterosaur tracks. This was the first report of potential pterosaur tracks to the scientific literature. 1863 * The book \\"La Terre avant Le Deluge\\" by Louis Figuier was published. It included an early restoration of a Rhamphorhynchus walking across the ground on all fours. This depiction was based on fossil footprints from the Solnhofen limestone attributed to the taxon. 1869 * Harry Govier Seeley described the new genus Ornithocheirus. =1870s= Type specimen of Cycnorhamphus Early restoration of Ornithostoma Othniel Charles Marsh (left) and his rival Edward Drinker Cope (right) Type specimen of Coloborhynchus The short-crested female type specimen of Pteranodon Life restoration of a male Pteranodon 1870 * Seeley described the new genus Cycnorhamphus and the new species Ornithocheirus huxleyi. * Seeley argued that pterosaurs represented the evolutionary transitional form between reptiles and birds, distinguished from the traditional reptiles by a warm-blooded metabolism as well as bird like anatomy, physiology and terrestrial gait. The claim ignited a \\"violent controversy\\" with the Owen due to his more traditional perspectives on pterosaurs and his hostility to evolutionary theory. * Othniel Charles Marsh described the new genus and species Laornis edvardsianus. November, late * Marsh's Yale Peabody Museum crews visited Kansas. Marsh discovered the first Pteranodon wing bones. These were the first scientifically described pterosaur fossils from North America. November ‚Äì December 31st * Sir Richard Owen expressed astonishment at the North American discovery of pterosaurs exceeding the size of warm-blooded birds and mammals, given his interpretation of the group as typical cold blooded reptiles. 1871 * Seeley described the new genus Ornithostoma for a toothless pterosaur from the Cambridge Greensand. He also described the new genus Diopecephalus. He observed that pterosaurs had large, birdlike brains. * Marsh discovered further Pteranodon remains. * Marsh discovered the type specimen of Pterodactylus velox. * Marsh described the new species Pterodactlus oweni based on some Pteranodon wing bones. He attributed teeth to the species. * Edward Drinker Cope discovered at least two Pteranodon specimens. * William Carruthers described two new oospecies of Oolithes and suggested that these fossil eggs were laid by pterosaurs. 1872 March 7th * Marsh described the species Pterodactylus ingens. He continued to attribute teeth to Pteranodon. Marsh realized that his species name Pterodactylus oweni had already been used, so renamed it Pterodactylus occidentalis. Marsh also named Pterodactylus velox. March 12th * Cope also attributed teeth to Pteranodon. * Cope described the new species Ornithochirus umbrosus and O. harpyia. * Cope published an additional paper on his \\"Ornithochirus\\" species. This paper was read before the American Philosophical Society. March 12th ‚Äì December 31st * An anonymous review synonymized Cope's Ornithochirus umbrosus and O. harpyia with Marsh's Pterodactylus ingens and Pterodactylus occidentalis, respectively. 1874 * Cope acknowledged the validity of Marsh's Pterodactylus ingens and P. occidentalis, but continued to insist that his O. umbrosus was a valid species, although he came to refer it to Pterodactylus. This paper included the first illustrations of Pteranodon wing bones. * A pterosaur fossil bearing an impression of the wing membrane was discovered. This was the first physical evidence of the structure which had previously been inferred purely from skeletal anatomy. * Owen described the new genus Coloborhynchus. 1875 * Cope argued that his Ornithochirus species supposedly synonymous with Marsh's Pterodactylus species actually had priority because while Marsh's description was published first, Cope's would have been if not for delays caused by a fire at the publisher. * Mudge discovered the type specimen of Pteranodon comptus. * Seeley described the new genus Doratorhynchus. 1876 May * Samuel Wendell Williston discovered the type specimen of Pteranodon. May ‚Äì December 31st * Marsh described the new genus and species Pteranodon longiceps and referred the toothless American pterosaurs to the new order Pteranodontia. He also described the new species Pteranodon comptus and P. gracilis. * Marsh published additional research on American pterosaurs. He acknowledged that his referral of teeth to the genus was an error. Marsh described the new genus Nyctosaurus for \\"Pteranodon\\" gracilis. * Williston helped excavate the Pteranodon specimen YPM 1177. * Brous and Williston helped excavate the Pteranodon specimen YPM 2473. 1877 * Charles H. Sternberg discovered AMNH 5098, a Pteranodon specimen with fossil fish and crustacean remains preserved in its throat pouch in Kansas. =1880s= Rhamphorhynchus \\"phyllurus\\" from an 1882 publication by Othniel Charles Marsh Illustration of the type specimen of \\"Ptenodracon\\" (actually just a juvenile Ctenochasma) 1881 * Marsh described the new genus Dermodactylus as well as the new genus and species Laopteryx priscus. * Marsh renamed Nyctosaurus Nyctodactylus under the mistaken belief that the latter genus was preoccupied. 1882 * Marsh described the new species Rhamphorhynchus phyllurus from the Solnhofen lithographic limestone. The type specimen displayed exquisitely preserved impressions of the animal's wing membranes as well as a diamond shaped fin at the end of the tail. Marsh thought that this fin was oriented vertically because it was slightly asymmetrical and could be used help the pterosaur steer as it flew. However, Marsh's hypothesis regarding the orientation of the tail vane would later become controversial. * Karl Alfred von Zittel described a fossil Rhamphorhynchus wing from the Solnhofen lithographic limestone that also preserved lifelike impressions of the wing membrane. He observed that the wing of Rhamphorhynchus was strengthened by fibrous tissue. Based on this specimen, Zittel concluded that in life Rhamphorhynchus had relatively narrow wings, whereas Marsh thought the wings were much wider. The wing Zittel studied has been known as the \\"Zittel wing\\" in his honor ever since. 1884 * Marsh reported that by this time the Yale Peabody Museum curated over 600 Pteranodon specimens. He also published more information about the skull of the Pteranodon type specimen and illustrated it. Marsh suspected that Pteranodon lacked a sclerotic ring, since one was absent in even well-preserved specimens. 1886 * Francesco Bassani described the new genus and species Tribelesodon longobardicus from Besano, Italy as the first known Triassic pterosaur. 1887 * Seeley described the new genus and species Ornithodesmus cluniculus. 1888 * Richard Lydekker described the new genus Ptenodracon for the second pterosaur specimen to be discovered. This genus is now regarded as a junior synonym of Pterodactylus because the traits supposedly \\"Ptenodracon\\" instead indicate that the specimen was a juvenile. * Newton reported the discovery of an endocast of a pterosaur brain in the Lias of Whitby, England. The find revealed that pterosaur brains were more like modern birds than reptiles. =1890s= Samuel Wendell Williston in 1891 1891 * Wiliston published what paleontologist Michael Everhart called the first complete description of Pteranodon this year. Notable observations in this publication include the discovery of a sclerotic ring in this taxon. Williston also found a coprolite containing tiny, indeterminate bone fragments preserved in one Pteranodon's pelvic area. Williston also argued that previous estimates of Pteranodon's wingspan were exaggerated and that the maximum wingspan of the genus was just short of 20 feet. 1892 * Williston disputed the length of Pteranodon's crest in Marsh's 1884 reconstruction. * Williston published a redescription of the skull of Pteranodon based on a more recently discovered and better preserved specimen, KUVP 2212. He also criticized the length of Pteranodon's crest in Marsh's 1884 reconstruction of the specimen YPM 1177 as being too speculative given the quality of its preservation. Williston speculated that Pteranodon-like fossils would be one day discovered in Europe, and that in this case Pteranodon was probably a junior synonym of Ornithostoma. In this paper Williston also described a new, relatively complete Nyctosaurus specimen. He noted that the only published trait distinguishing the genus from Pterodactylus was an absence of teeth and recommended synonymizing these two genera if \\"Nyctosaurus\\" teeth were ever found. 1893 * Williston argued that Pteranodon was a junior synonym of Ornithostoma. He praised Cope for recognizing these affinities, while lambasting Marsh for being unable to do so despite having a larger number of specimens. According to Everhart, Williston's criticism of Marsh may have been motivated by mistreatment at his hands while he worked for him. 1895 * Williston published a description of the lower jaw of Pteranodon. This was the first such specimen not to be \\"crushed from side to side\\". 1896 * Williston published a description of another Pteranodon skull and synonymized the genus with Ornithostoma. 1897 * Williston reported that Seeley was also unable to find any trait in Pteranodon distinguishing it from Ornithostoma. 20th century =1900s= The Nyctosaurus specimen FMNH 25026. 1901 * Felix Plieninger formally divided the pterosaurs into two suborders, the long-tailed Rhamphorhynchoidea and the short-tailed Pterodactyloids. * Seeley published Dragons of the Air. This was the first \\"serious boo[k]\\" about pterosaurs. In it he restored pterosaurs with the wing membrane attached to the hindlimb. 1902 * Williston published further anatomical description of Nyctosaurus based on a recently discovered well-preserved specimen now catalogued as FMNH 25026. He estimated its live weight as less than five pounds. He interpreted the skull as completely lacking a crest. * Williston published another paper about FMNH 25026 in which he described the skull in detail and photographed it. * Williston published a popular article about pterosaurs for Popular Science Monthly. In this article, Williston restored pterosaurs with the wing membrane attached to the hindlimb. According to Everhart, by this point Williston had \\"largely given up\\" in his attempts to synonymize Pteranodon with Ornithostoma. Skeletal reconstruction of Scleromochlus 1903 * Williston observed that the generic name Nyctosaurus was not actually preoccupied. He speculated that Marsh probably came to believe that it was preoccupied because of the existence of a higher order taxon called Nyctisauria. Since Nyctosaurus was not preoccupied, Williston reclassified \\"Nyctodactylus\\" back to the original genus. Williston also described the new genus and species Apatomerus mirus for a partial pterosaur femur from the Kiowa Shale of Kansas. This specimen is now catalogued as KUVP 1198. This paper contained a notable error wherein Williston claimed that Pteranodon lacked a fibula. * George Francis Eaton published a paper defending Marsh's research on Pteranodon against Williston. Life restoration of Scleromochlus 1904 * Eaton published a paper defending Marsh's research on Pteranodon against Williston. Some of Eaton's criticisms have since come under fire. For instance, Everhart has noted that Eaton's criticism of Williston for reporting a sclerotic ring in Pteranodon rather than Nyctosaurus ignored the fact that Eaton had found sclerotic rings in both genera. * Williston published a paper on pterosaur fingers. 1907 * Plieninger described the species Rhamphorhynchus kokeni from the Nusplingen lithographic limestone. * Woodward described the new genus and species Scleromochlus taylori. =1910s= 1910 * Eaton published his doctoral dissertation on the osteology of Pteranodon. This publication was the most significant work about Pteranodon as well as large pterosaurs generally for many decades afterward. In this monograph, he restored pterosaurs with the wing membrane attached to the hindlimb. He concurred with earlier work by Marsh and Williston that Pteranodon had a short tail. According to Everhart, Eaton toned down his former stridently defensive attitude toward Marsh and warmed up somewhat to Williston's work. He noted that the supposed wing bones of Pteranodon comptus were actually Nyctosaurus tibiae and that P. ingens and P. occidentalis were only distinguishable by their sizes. Everhart also noted that Eaton actually followed some of Williston's work \\"too closeley\\" and repeated Williston's erroneous claim that Pteranodon lacked a fibula. * Williston finally confirmed the presence of a fibula in Pteranodon, correcting his previous error that mislead Eaton. 1911 * Williston published a favorable review of Eaton's dissertation and conceded that his earlier criticism of Marsh's Pteranodon skull reconstruction was baseless. * Williston published a restoration of Nyctosaurus. This was his last paper on pterosaurs. Reconstruction of the skull of Lonchodectes Skull of Parapsicephalus 1913 * Hooley described the new subfamily Ptenodraconinae based on Lydekker's misguided genus Ptenodracon. 1914 * Hooley described the new genus Lonchodectes. * Hankin and Watson published the first study of the aerodynamics of pterosaur flight. They concluded that Pteranodon spent much more time soaring than actively flapping. On the ground, however, Hankin and Watson argued that pterosaurs would have been \\"completely helpless\\" and could only move about by \\"pushing themselves along, after the manner of penguins.\\" 1918 * Arthaber described the new genus and species Parapsicephalus. =1920s= 1920 * Wiman published a description of the fossils purchased by the Paleontological Museum in Uppsala, Sweden from C. H. Sternberg, which included Pteranodon fossils. He confirmed the presence of a fibula in some of the specimens. Life restoration of Anurognathus Life restoration of Campylognathoides 1921 * Friedrich von Huene described the new genus Rhabdopelix. 1922 * Nopcsa described in detail and reconstructed Bassani's purported Triassic pterosaur from Italy, Tribelesodon. 1923 * D√∂derlein described the new genus Anurognathus. 1925 * Abel argued that pterosaurs would have to walk on all fours when not in the air, like a modern bat. 1927 * Broili described possible fossil evidence for a hair like body covering in pterosaurs from Germany. 1928 * Strand described the new genus Campylognathoides. * Nessov described the new genus Bennettazhia. 1929 * Bernhard Peyer discovered that the purported Triassic pterosaur Tribelesodon was actually a juvenile Tanystrophaeus, whose long neck vertebrae were mistaken for a wing-finger. =1930s= 1937 * Koh described the new species Rhamphorhynchus intermedius. 1938 * Kenneth Caster conclusively demonstrated that unusual fossil tracks from the Solnhofen lithographic limestone variously attributed to creatures like Archaeopteryx, little dinosaurs, or pterosaurs were actually made by horseshoe crabs, as specimens had been found literally \\"dead in their tracks\\". 1939 * Broili described the new genus and species Belonochasma aenigmaticum. =1940s= Fossil of a dead horseshoe crab at the end of a type of fossil trackway once attributed to pterosaurs 1940 * Caster reported finding a dead horseshoe crab at the end of a type of fossil trackway once attributed to long-tailed pterosaurs. 1943 * Brown reported a Pteranodon specimen with the remains of two fish species and a crustacean preserved where its throat pouch would have been in life. 1948 * Riabinin described the new genus and species Batrachognathus volans. =1950s= Life restoration of \\"Pteranodon\\" (now Geosternbergia) sternbergi 1952 * George F. Sternberg discovered an unusual Pteranodon skull in Kansas, FHSM VP-339 that would later serve as the type specimen of the species Pteranodon sternbergi. 1954 * Ambroggi and Lapparent described the new ichnogenus and ichnospecies Agadirichnus elegans. They attributed these tracks to a lizard. 1956 * Sternberg discovered another specimen of P. sternbergi near WaKeeney, Kansas which is now catalogued as FHSM VP-184. This specimen lacked a skull and was smaller than the type. In life it would have had a roughly 12.5 foot wingspan. 1957 * Stokes described the new ichnogenus and species Pteraichnus saltwashensis from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of Utah, USA, interpreting them as pterosaur tracks. Stokes reported the presence of an impression left by the putative pterosaurian trackmaker's wing finger, although this claim is probably mistaken. If his identification of these tracks was correct, it would mean that pterosaurs walked on all fours. * Eric von Holst published an experimental study of Rhamphorhynchus flight biomechanics that utilized a flapping scale model. Because the model could only fly when its tail vane was oriented horizontally rather than vertically, von Holst concluded that Marsh's original reconstruction was erroneous. 1958 * Sternberg and Walker reported the second P. sternbergi specimen to the scientific literature. * Kuhn accepted the pterosaurian interpretation of Pteraichnus. =1960s= Life restoration of Germanodactylus. Skull of Dsungaripterus . 1962 * George Sternberg discovered a nearly complete Nyctosaurus specimen near Elkader, Kansas which is now catalogued as FHSM VP-2148. 1963 * Delair described the new ichnogenus and ichnospecies Purbeckopus pentadactylus. Delair did not recognize the tracks as pterosaurian. 1964 * Bonner reported the Elkader Nyctosaurus discovered by Sternberg to the scientific literature and described the new species N. sternbergi based on it. * C. C. Young described the new genus Dsungaripterus from Early Cretaceous rocks in China. * Young described the new genus Germanodactylus. * Kuhn continued to accept the pterosaurian interpretation of Pteraichnus. 1966 * Harksen described the new species Pteranodon sternbergi. Unlike P. longiceps, this species had a short, wide crest. 1968 * Peter Wellnhofer published a revision of the taxonomy of Pterodactylus. It was his first publication about pterosaurs. 1969 * Colbert described the new genus and species Nesodactylus hesperius. =1970s= Life restoration of Pterodaustro Fossil skeleton of Sordes pilosus Fossil skeleton of Eudimorphodon Skeletal mount of Quetzalcoatlus 1970 * John Ostrom reported that the type specimen of \\"Pterodactylus\\" crassipes actually represented a fourth specimen of Archaeopteryx. This was the fourth specimen referrable to that genus ever discovered. * Bonaparte described the new genus and species Pterodaustro guinazui. This genus was the most extremely specialized filter-feeding pterosaur known to science. 1971 * Miller published a review of Pterandon's known fossil record and proposed a new classification scheme for the species in the genus. However, his scheme has largely since been rejected. He also observed that Nyctosaurus sternbergi was a preoccupied species name and renamed it N. bonneri after its describer. * Miller described a new specimen of Pteranodon longiceps discovered near Elkader, Kansas which is now catalogued as FHSM VP-2183. * Heptonstall published an article on the biomechanics of Pteranodon flight. * Sharov described the new genus and species Sordes pilosus from Late Jurassic rocks in Kazakhstan. The type specimen seemed to reveal the presence of a body covering of hair-like filaments. * Price reported the first pterosaur fossils from the lagerstatten Crato and Santana formations of Brazil. These deposits would go on to be some of the most important pterosaur fossil sources in the world due to their high quality three dimensional preservation. * Price described the new genus and species Araripesaurus castilhoi. * Sharov described the new genus and species Sordes pilosus. * Wild described the new species Dorygnathus mistelgauensis. * Haubold accepted the pterosaurian interpretation of Pteraichnus. 1973 * Rocco Zambelli described the new genus and species Eudimorphodon ranzii from the Upper Triassic of Bergamo, Italy. This was the first true Triassic pterosaur. * Young described the new genus and species Noripterus complicidens. 1974 * Bramwell and Whitfield re-examined the biomechanics of Pteranodon flight after an extended lull in research on the topic. They estimated that a Pteranodon with a 7 m wingspan would have a mass of about 16 kg. To stay aloft, such a Pteranodon would need to fly at least 6.7 m/s, which is regarded as an \\"extremely low\\" minimum speed. Such a load would have allowed it to take off or land \\"gently\\". Bramwell and Witfield argued that the biomechanics may have left Pteranodon vulnerable to increasing wind speeds resulting from climate change as the Late Cretaceous proceeded and even tentatively suggested that this may have been the cause of extinction for the genus. * Fabre described the new genus Gallodactylus. * Casamiquela described the new genus and species Herbstosaurus pigmaeus. 1975 * Stein published an article on the biomechanics of Pteranodon flight. He crafted model Pteranodon wings and tested them in a wind tunnel. He found that Pteranodon was a capable, maneuverable flyer but was best adapted to long distance flights at low velocities. Stein calculated that a large Pteranodon would have to fly at least 10 miles an hour to stay airborne. He concluded that Pteranodon would have had to land on its hind feet because making the front feet ready for landing would collapse the wings, which would no longer be useful for keeping the pterosaur aloft. Stein's conclusions contradicted the previous findings of Bramwell and Whitfield. * Lawson described the new genus and species Quetzalcoatlus northropi. 1977 * Wellnhofer described the new genus and species Araripedactylus dehmi. * Logue reported Pteraichnus-like tracks in Wyoming. 1978 * Wild described the new genus and species Peteinosaurus zambellii. In this paper he also described Eudimorphodon in greater detail. * West reported Pteraichnus-like tracks in Oklahoma. * Wellnhofer argued in favor of quadrupedal pterosaurs. * Stokes reported additional potential pterosaur tracks from the Navajo Formation. 1979 * Kevin Padian published a study on the biomechanics of pterosaur flight. * Stokes and Madsen reported additional potential pterosaur tracks from the Navajo Formation. =1980s= 1980 * Brower published an article on the biomechanics of Pteranodon flight. His conclusions contradicted the findings of Bramwell and Whitfield, however. * de Buisonj√© described the new genus and species Santanadactylus brasilensis. 1981 * Frey and Riess published a study on the biomechanics of pterosaur flight. * Galton described the new genus and species Comodactylus ostromi. 1982 * Dong described the new genus and species Huanhepterus quingyangensis. Skeletal reconstruction of Dimorphodon as a biped Fossil wing bones of Azhdarcho 1983 * Frey and Riess published a study on the biomechanics of pterosaur flight. * Padian argued that the wing membrane of pterosaurus probably did not attach to the hindlimb and that pterosaurs had narrow wings comparable in proportion to those of modern soaring sea birds. He also argued based on the skeletal anatomy of Dimorphodon that it and other pterosaurs probably walked on their hind legs when not airborne. * Padian published an additional paper arguing for bipedal pterosaurs. * Brower studied the aerodynamics of Nyctosaurus and Pteranodon by comparing them to hang gliders. He concluded that both were unable to ascend or descend at high speed. He thought that they spent most of their time soaring rather than actively flapping. Brower thought Pteranodon itself to be entirely incapable of flapping flight. His conclusions contradicted the previous findings of Bramwell and Whitfield. * He, Yan and Su described the new genus and species Angustinaripterus longicephalus. * Wild described the new genus and species Preondactylus buffarinii. * Leonardi and Borgomanero described the new genus and species Cearadactylus atrox. 1984 * Nessov described the new genus and species Azhdarcho lancicollis. * Kevin Padian and Paul Olsen reinterpreted the supposed pterosaur tracks named Pteraichnus from the Morrison Formation of Utah as crocodilian tracks. They argued in favor of bipedal pterosaurs. * Padian described the new genus and species Rhamphinion jenkinsi. * Kellner described the new genus and species Brasileodactylus araripensis. * Haubold continued to accept the pterosaurian interpretation of Pteraichnus. He also argued that pterosaurs were quadrupedal. 1985 * Schultz and others argued that the type specimen of Apatomerus mirus was not actually a pterosaur fossils. * Aeronautical engineer Alan McCready designed a flying model of Quetzalcoatlus in an experimental attempt to ascertain how a creature of its size could even be capable of flight. However, his results were inconclusive. * Campos and Kellner described the new genus and species Anhanguera blittersdorffi. 1986 * Martins Neto described the new genus and species Pricesaurus megalodon. * Unwin published a paper regarding the debate over the identity of the Pteraichnus trackmaker. 1987 * Bennett observed that the tail of Pteranodon was longer than generally thought, being at least 19 cm on a Pteranodon with a 7.5 m wingspan. He hypothesized that this lengthier tail could have supported an additional membrane that would have assisted the animal's pitch during flight. However, Bennett has subsequently disavowed the idea that Pteranodon supported a membrane with its tail. * Nessov and Borkin described the new genus Arambourgiania. * Padian published another paper arguing for bipedal pterosaurs. * Conrad and others \\"assumed\\" that the ichnogenus Purbeckopus was produced by a crocodylian. * Unwin published a paper regarding the debate over the identity of the Pteraichnus trackmaker. * Leonardi suggested that the supposed pterosaur footprints Stokes reported from the Navajo Formation in the 1970s were actually produced by the same kind of non-pterosaurian animal that made Batrachopus. Skull of Tupuxuara 1988 * Russell estimated that by this time 878 Pteranodon specimens were known. * Pennycuick published a study on the biomechanics of pterosaur flight. * Wellnhofer studied the range of motion in the hip and hind limbs of three-dimensionally preserved pterosaur fossils from the Crato Formation of Brazil for insight into their terrestrial gait. He concluded that they walked on all fours. * Kellner and Campos described the new genus and species Tupuxuara longicristatus. 1989 * Kellner described the new genus and species Tapejara wellnhoferi. * Jensen and Padian described the new genus and species Mesadactylus ornithosphyos. * Nessov and Yarkov described the new genus Bogolubovia. * Prince and Lockley \\"assumed\\" that the ichnogenus Purbeckopus was produced by a crocodylian. * Unwin published a paper regarding the debate over the identity of the Pteraichnus trackmaker. * Gillette and Thomas reported additional potential pterosaur footprints. =1990s= Pterandon longiceps and P. sternbergi. The grey areas were not preserved in their respective specimens. 1990 * Michael Everhart discovered his first Pteranodon specimen in Kansas. In life it would have had a roughly 14 foot wingspan. * Stewart reported that Nyctosaurus and Pteranodon made their first appearances in the stratigraphic column in the middle of the Smoky Hill Chalk, which dates back to the Santonian. * Bennett published a study of the biostratigraphy of Pteranodon. He found that the type specimen of P. sternbergi was discovered in the lower chalk, while the type specimen of P. longiceps was discovered in the upper portion of the chalk. 1991 * Peter Wellnhofer published The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Pterosaurs. Wellnhofer's book was only the second serious book about pterosaurs ever published. In it, he argued that Othniel Charles Marsh was correct to reconstruct the tail vane of Rhamphorhynchus with a vertical orientation based on its asymmetry and also provided additional evidence for this orientation based on the shape of its tail vertebrae. Wellnhofer also observed that pterosaurs had large, birdlike brains. Wellnhofer also argued in favor of quadrupedal pterosaurs. * Chatterjee described the new genus and species Protoavis texensis. Life restoration of Tupuxuara Life restoration of Zhejiangopterus 1992 * Bennett published a study of sexual dimorphism in Pteranodon using 400 specimens. He found there to be two size based morphs, a larger form with a larger crest and narrow pelvis and a small form with a small crest and wide pelvis. He concluded that the larger form was male and the smaller form was female. He found that female Pteranodon outnumbered male Pteranodon by 2:1. Bennett argued that since large crests were only associated with one size morph, that it functioned purely as display. He also hypothesized that Pteranodon sternbergi was the direct ancestor of Pteranodon longiceps. * Bennett argued that the purported pterosaur footprints reported by Gillette and Thomas were actually produced by crocodylians. * Lockley and others reported the presence of Early Cretaceous pterosaur tracks in Spain. 1993 * Moratalla reported the presence of Early Cretaceous pterosaur tracks in Spain. 1994 * Bennett studied the Pteranodon remains curated by the Yale Peabody Museum. His research debunked several claims originally made by O. C. Marsh. The teeth Marsh originally referred to Pteranodon Bennett attributed to the fish genus Xiphactinus. Bennet also argued that none of the Pteranodon species Marsh named after P. longiceps were actually distinct from it. Bennett criticized conclusions drawn by Miller and Harksen as well. Bennett criticized the former's 1971 classification scheme for Pteranodon species and the latter's 1966 reconstruction of Pteranodon sternbergi as having excessively long jaws. Nyctosaurus also received some attention in this paper. Bennett concluded that N. bonneri was a junior synonym of N. gracilis. * Unwin and Bakhurina published a paper arguing that much of the supposed soft tissue impressions of the Sordes type specimen were not the remains of a furry body covering. Instead, they seemed to be the remains of the fibrous tissue that reinforced the wing membrane. * Frey and Martill described the new genus and species Arthurdactylus conandoylei. * Cai and Wei described the new genus and species Zhejiangopterus linhaiensis. * Kellner and Campos described the new species Tupuxuara leonardii. * Lee described the new species Coloborhynchus wadleighi. * Logue reported the discovery of a new fossil track site featuring Pteraichnus-like traces. * Moratalla and others reported fossil pterosaur footprints in Europe. Life restoration of Plataleorhynchus 1995 * Jean-Michel Mazin and others reported the discovery of footprints left behind by during the Late Jurassic in what is now Crayssac, France which they attributed to pterosaurs. This paper has been regarded as the conclusion of the controversy regarding the type of gait pterosaurs utilized on the ground. * Lockley and others described the new ichnospecies Pteraichnus stokesi. * Howse and A. R. Milner described the new genus and species Plataleorhynchus streptophorodon. * Padian, de Ricql√©s and Horner described the new genus and species Montanazhdarcho minor. * The putative pterosaurian origins of Pteraichnus ignited controversy at the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. * Moratalla and others reported the presence of Early Cretaceous pterosaur tracks in Spain. * Lockley and Hunt reported the discovery of a new fossil track site featuring Pteraichnus-like traces. They also argued that the supposed pterosaur footprints Stokes reported from the Navajo Formation in the 1970s were actually synapsid tracks. 1996 * Bennett argued that some pterosaur traits were inconsistent with their hypothesized membership in the archosaurs. * Harris and Carpenter described the new genus and species Kepodactylus insperatus. * Carpenter reported the presence of coprolites associated with a Pteranodon specimen discovered in the Pierre Shale. The coprolites contained fish bones. * Karl Hirsch tentatively concluded that the putative pterosaur eggs Oolithes were actually laid by turtles. Pterosaur eggs would remain unknown in the fossil record until 2004. * Lockley and Unwin noted the Pteraichnus controversy at the previous years meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists. * Time magazine featured a story about the Pteraichnus controversy. * Lockley and others published further research on North American pterosaur tracks. June 1st * Pamela Everhart discovered a Pteranodon specimen in Kansas. Pam and her husband Michael partially excavated the specimen and covered the rest of the fossils until a more thorough excavation was possible. June 29‚Äì30th * Michael and Pamela Everhart returned to finish excavating the Pteranodon, which had a roughly 17 foot wingspan. Life restoration of Tapejara imperator 1997 * Liggett and others reported a Pteranodon femur from the Cenomanian Greenhorn Formation in Kansas. * Kellner described the new species Tapejara imperator. * Ji Q. and Ji S. described the new genus and species Eosipterus yangi. * Miller published an article in Earth magazine about the Pteraichnus controversy. * Lockley and Mickelson published further research on North American pterosaur tracks. * Lockley and others reported the first pterosaur tracks known from Asia. * Bennett \\"explicitly endorsed\\" the pterosaurian interpretation of Pteraichnus. * Unwin also \\"explicitly endorsed\\" the pterosaurian interpretation of Pteraichnus. 1998 * Clark, Hopson, Hern√°ndez, Fastovsky and Montellano described the new species Dimorphodon weintraubi. * Buffetaut, Lepage, J.-J. and Lepage, G., described the new genus and species Normannognathus wellnhoferi. * Lockley published further research on North American pterosaur tracks. May * Chris Bennet referred the 1996 Everhart Pteranodon specimen to the species P. sternbergi. June * Michael and Pamela Everhart returned to the site of their 1996 Pteranodon discovery to search for additional remains of the animal. However, extensive digging only produced one additional bone from the specimen. 1999 * The Everharts donated their 1996 Pteranodon specimen to the Cincinnati Museum Center. It is now catalogued as CMC VP-7203. * Ji S., Ji Q. and Padian described the new genus Dendrorhynchoides. * Unwin and Heinrich described the new genus and species Tendaguripterus recki. * Lockley reported the presence of pterosaur tracks in the Late Cretaceous North Horn Formation of Utah. 21st century =2000s= Life restoration of Nyctosaurus 2000 * Martill and others described the new genus and species Domeykodactylus ceciliae. * Bennett reported the discovery of three new Nyctosaurus specimens from Kansas to that year's annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists. One specimen had a 15-foot wingspan and represented a new size record for the species. The other two, discovered near WaKeeney, bore strange large branching crests. * Kellner and Tomida described the new genus and species Anhanguera piscator. * Bennett described the anatomy of the pterosaur wing membrane. * Garcia Ramos and others published research on exceptionally well-preserved Late Jurassic pterosaur tracks in Asturias, Spain. These tracks are important both by being the tracks of a particularly large pterosaur and by clearly preserving the webbing between its toes. 2001 * Jenkens and others described the new species Eudimorphodon cromptonellus. * Chris Bennett published the first monograph-length discussion of Pteranodon in more than 90 years. One of his more notable conclusions was that the reconstructions used by previous researchers to study Pteranodon flight biomechanics were so inaccurate that any conclusions drawn from them were completely invalid. * Wang and L√º Junchang described the new genus and species Haopterus gracilis. * Howse, Milner, and Martill described the new genus Istiodactylus. * Dalla Vecchia and others reported the discovery of pterosaur fossils in Lebanon. * Paleontologists gathered at Toulouse for a scientific conference dedicated solely to pterosaurs. * Fuentes Vidarte published research on Early Cretaceous pterosaur tracks in Spain. * Mazin and others reported the existence of fossil pterosaur tracks preserving the impression of a fifth toe. This suggests that the trackmaker was a primitive long-tailed pterosaur. * Garcia Ramos and others published research on exceptionally well-preserved Late Jurassic pterosaur tracks in Asturias, Spain. * Lockley and others argued that there were two different types of fossil footprint assemblages that include Pteraichnus that differed by the type of a rock they were preserved in. One type of Pteraichnus-bearing track assemblage is associated with carbonate rocks, and the other with clastic rocks. 3-dimensional restoration of Hatzegopteryx 2002 * Hwang and others described the new ichnogenus and ichnospecies Haenamichnus uhangriensis. * Helmut Tischlinger and Eberhard Frey studied pterosaur fossils under ultraviolet light in order to learn more about their soft tissues. * Dalla Vecchia and others described the new genus and species Austriadactylus cristatus. * Buffetaut, Grigorescu, and Csiki described the new genus and species Hatzegopteryx thambema. * Wang and others described the new genus and species Jeholopterus ninchengensis. * Varricchio described the new genus and species Piksi barbarulna. * Czerkas and Ji described the new genus and species Pterorhynchus wellnhoferi. * Kellner and Campos described the new genus and species Thalassodromeus sethi. * Czerkas and Mickelson described the new genus and species Utahdactylus kateae. * Unwin and Henderson published a review of paleontology's understanding of pterosaur paleobiology. * Garcia Ramos and others published research on exceptionally well-preserved Late Jurassic pterosaur tracks in Asturias, Spain. 2003 Life restoration of Ludodactylus. Fossil skeleton of Sinopterus. Skeletal reconstruction of a pterosaur being bitten by the spinosaur Irritator * Frey, Martill and Buchy described the new species Tapejara navigans. * Veldmeijer described the new species Coloborhynchus spielbergi. * Bennet described the Nyctosaurus specimens with unusual and large crests. He hypothesized that only adult males bore the very large crests. Despite their large size, Bennett concluded that the crests were sufficiently streamlined to exert minimal impact on the animal's aerodynamics. * An amateur fossil hunter discovered a \\"very large\\" complete Pteranodon sternbergi skull in Kansas, although the specimen is still held in his private collection and has not received significant scientific attention. * L√º described the new genus and species Beipiaopterus chenianus. * Wang and Zhou described the new genus and species Chaoyangopterus zhangi. * Carpenter and others described the new genus and species Harpactognathus gentryii. * Dong, Sun, and Wu described the new genus and species Jidapterus edentus. * Wang and Zhou described the new genus and species Liaoningopterus gui. * Frey, Martill, and Buchy described the new genus and species Ludodactylus sibbicki. * Pereda-Suberbiola and others described the new genus and species Phosphatodraco mauritanicus. * Wang and Zhou described the new genus and species Sinopterus dongi. * Frey and others published a study on the wing membranes of \\"dark wing\\" specimen of Rhamphorhynchus. This study helped advance paleontologists' understanding of the internal musculature and blood vasculature of the pterosaur wing. This study utilized UV light to help reveal greater detail in the specimen than is visible to the unaided eye. They also reported the existence of pterosaur crests composed entirely of soft tissue. * Wellnhofer found primitive pterosaurs to have a mandibular fenestra, a trait linking them to the archosaurs. * Kellner published a study attempting to reconstruct the evolutionary history of pterosaurs.

After the Fall of France he served briefly as a liaison officer to Charles de Gaulle. He then worked with British intelligence in Cape Verde. Late in January 1941 he was transferred to the Special Operations Executive's (SOE) Middle East section, and a few weeks later he was appointed to lead para-naval SOE operations in the Middle East based in Haifa and Alexandria (Force 133).Royal Navy Research Archive \\"In Search of Mike Cumberlege\\".

For this purpose, he and his team operated a lightly armed ca√Øque called HMS Dolphin II. In April 1941 Cumberlege secretly navigated the Corinth Canal and laid a time-delayed mine and depth charges; however, the charges failed to detonate. The failure of the mission was a blow to British military strategy in North Africa, but in his report the Director of Naval Intelligence went out of his way to exonerate Cumberlege from blame. Meantime, Cumberlege had participated in Operation Demon, the Allied evacuation from Greece. Dolphin II ferried troops from the beaches of Navplion and Monemvasia to British transports before sailing for Crete. In Canae, Cumberlege met with Captain Nicholas Hammond and Rhodesian private James 'Jumbo' Steele, the latter would eventually join him for Operation Locksmith. Mike had befriended the archaeologist John Pendlebury before the war and they planned to raid the Dodecanese islands but the German airborne invasion of Crete prevented the operation from being carried out. The engines of Dolphin II having given out, Cumberlege commandeered the caique Athanassios Miaoulis and escaped from Crete with his cousin Major Cleland Cumberlege, Hammond, Steele, Able Seaman Saunders and a Greek crew. After they crossed the Kasos Strait, they were machine-gunned by a German aircraft, Cleland and Saunders were killed and Mike wounded but they managed to reach Mersa Matruh.Platon Alexiades, Target Corinth Canal 1940-1944, Pen & Sword, 2015. After the Battle of Crete, Cumberlege aided in the evacuation of dozens of Allied personnel who were stranded on occupied Crete. The ca√Øques HMS Escampador and HMS Hedgehog (which were under the command of Cumberlege), successfully rescued 550 Allied troops from the Cretan coast. Once pre-arranged evacuations became impossible, he spent three weeks surreptitiously mapping the deserted south coast of Crete between Cape Litinon and Tsoutsouros Bay, looking for landing beaches and hide-outs for small craft and landing several SOE agents and supplies, without being detected.

Steele, Sergeant Thomas E. Hendley (radio operator) and Czech Corporal Jan Kotrba embarked on Operation Locksmith. It was at Beirut, they boarded the Greek submarine Papanicolis - Lieutenant Nicolaos Roussen RNA. The operation was a fresh attempt to block the Corinth Canal, applying the lessons which had been learnt from the failed 1941 attempt. Cumberlege was centrally involved in the planning process, and led the mission. Unfortunately, Cumberlege's superiors had rejected inserting a Greek-speaking man.Platon Alexiades, Target Corinth Canal 1940-1944, Pen & Sword, 2015.

A German patrol was put ashore in the Tselevinia area and Cumberlege's hideout was discovered.Platon Alexiades, Target Corinth Canal 1940-1944, Pen & Sword, 2015. Cumberlege and his group managed to escape, but most of their communications equipment was captured. Three days later the group received a message ostensibly from SOE Cairo that a British submarine was coming to rescue it. On the night of 30 April, the group was captured by German forces who had lured them into a trap using the captured communications equipment. =Prisoner of war= At the beginning of May 1943, Cumberlege and his colleagues were taken to Averoff Prison in Athens. Despite the German policy of summarily executing captured Allied commandos, Cumberlege was not immediately shot. Instead he was transferred with his colleagues to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. There, under duress, Cumberlege signed a statement confirming that the Locksmith group were saboteurs ‚Äì despite having being captured in uniform. In January 1944, Cumberlege was moved to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Here he was held in solitary confinement and refused Red Cross parcels.

Dandridge was created by fans of the show, civil servants Roger Byrne and Charles Slane, who described him as a \\"semi-retired Actor-Manager in search of a big break\\". Like several other contributors, they chose a humorous pseudonym after many listeners had used double entendres in names to catch Wogan out. The pair emailed new material on a daily basis, which Wogan would then read out on his show, sometimes corpsing with laughter along with colleagues Paul Walters, Alan Dedicoat and John \\"Boggy\\" Marsh. The character was retired along with Wogan leaving the Radio 2 breakfast slot in 2009, although the character did return briefly the following year on Wogan's weekend show, Weekend Wogan. Dandridge misreported news and travel stories, interspersing them with a humorous monologue of his acting career. He frequently name dropped colleagues he claimed to meet in the theatre, and a regular in-joke was him complaining about being owed a white fiver (pre-1957 ¬£5 note) he lent a colleague when both were in repertory theatre. Wogan subsequently published some of the email transcripts in his autobiographies; in one, Dandridge compared the Eurovision Song Contest, which Wogan had presented for many years, to \\"a cabaret in pre-war Berlin, where I was naked, painted in zebra stripes and sitting bareback on a horse\\". David Sillito, Arts Correspondent for the BBC, suggested Dandridge was created to appeal to Wogan's love of author P. G. Wodehouse. Wogan thought Dandridge's monologues parodied Donald Sinden and his character, optimistically hoping to revive his showbusiness career, was based on Charles Dickens' Samuel Pickwick. Byrne and Slane eventually met Wogan at a bookstore signing in Dublin, surprising the latter who expected the pair to be significantly older.

During 19th century it was one of the main ethnic communities of the town and participated in its growth and development. Two pioneers of religious Zionism ‚Äì Rabbi Mordechai Eliasberg and Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook - lived and worked here. History Jews in the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia first settled in Courland from Germany and were different from Lithuanian Jews.Jewish Communities in Kurland In 1799, after the Duchy was incorporated in the Russian empire, Jews were officially allowed to live right outside Bauska city limits. Mostly Lithuanian Jews, they were orthodox, and built a wooden synagogue and established a cemetery. In 1820 Jews were allowed to settle and live in Bauska. For many years they formed the largest group of inhabitants here. They outnumbered Baltic Germans and Latvians, who were still mostly farmers and had not started to move to cities yet. Bauska was a lively market city and Jewish traders became middlemen between Latvian farmers and larger towns. In return, farmers purchased industrial goods and handicrafts from Jews.Bausk or Bauske In 1840, 82 Jewish families (692 people) moved to Kherson Governorate to become farmers. In 1844, a new stone synagogue was built in one corner of the City square. In 1856, Lubavicher Hasidim established their community in Bauska and built their own house of worship. In 1881, 3,631 Jews were living in Bauska, making them 60% of the town's population. Many had come illegally from Lithuania, and the population dropped after some were harassed or even expelled. =Early 20th century= After the beginning of the First World War Russian military authorities ordered all Jews to leave Courland Governorate. Not everyone obeyed, but most Jews did leave and moved to Russia. Soon after the end of German military occupation and end of the Latvian War of Independence Jewish life in the city resumed. In 1924 Bikur cholim society is legally registered. Hakoah football team actively participates in local competitions. During the establishment of Latvian Republic the lands of the old Jewish cemetery and the old wooden synagogue became a property of a local farmer, who used it to graze cattle and wanted to tear down the old wooden building for firewood. Jews demanded their rights to the cemetery to be restored but the court case dragged on for many years until they lost in 1935. In the flood of 1928 the Hasidim prayer house, which was right on the riverbank, was partially destroyed and they started using the main synagogue together with others. During those years Jewish traders and small manufacturers were once again very active. The largest sawmill and electricity plant, which provided Bauska with electricity, belonged to industrialist David Hofschowitz. After the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 all Jewish organizations and societies were closed. Their property was nationalized. Jewish women's association, support society Bikur cholim and burial association Chevra kadisha were closed. =Holocaust= Nazi troops reached Bauska on June 28, 1941. Most of the local Jews and some refugees from Lithuania were trapped in the city. Few Jews were publicly shot already in the first days of occupation - on July 2 five Jews, five communists and ten Red army soldiers were shot near the river Mƒìmele bridge. On July 1 the curfew was imposed on all inhabitants, but Jews were ordered to stay indoors longer than others ‚Äì from 6 in the evening until 7 in the morning. On July 5 all Jews between the ages of 18 and 50 were required to register with the German authorities, and also to turn in their radios. A small Jewish ghetto was established. In mid-July in the city ambulatory 56 Jews, including some boys, were castrated. This was organized by a local doctor, head of the police and head of German army units located in the city. All the remaining Jews were shot starting from August 9 in Vecsaule forest. Historians estimate that in the nearby woods Germans and their Latvian helpers from Arajs Kommando shot around 500-700 Bauska Jews and 150-200 Jews from nearby villages.\\"Neighbors\\" Didn‚Äôt Kill Jews On August 18, 1941 there was an ad in the local newspaper that the belongings ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù by Jews are to be auctioned off.

She was the first African- American woman transplant surgeon of the United States. She has received many honors in her career, having been named to both the \\"Best Doctors in America\\" and \\"Top Doctors in America\\" lists multiple times. Scantlebury has been awarded the Woman of Spirit Award for inspiring others and the \\"Gift of Life Award\\" from the National Kidney Foundation. In addition to recognition by the Caribbean American Medical and Scientific Association, she received the Order of Barbados Gold Crown of Merit, for her efforts to educate minorities about organ transplant. She has performed over 2,000 transplants and published many peer-reviewed papers. Early life and education Velma Patricia Scantlebury was born on 6 October 1955 in Goodland, St. Michael Parish, Barbados, to Kathleen (n√©e Jordan) and Delacey Whitstanley Scantlebury. She attended three years at Alleyne School in St. Andrew Parish, before her family moved to New York City in 1969. After completing her secondary education at Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn, Scantlebury began studying biology in 1973 at Long Island University Brooklyn. Though offered a one-year scholarship to Barnard College, she was concerned about the financial burden of continuing her studies and instead opted to attend school in Brooklyn, where she thrived. Medical school and surgical residency Graduating in 1977 with her BS in biology, she was accepted at both Yale School of Medicine and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S;). She chose to attend P&S;, earning her medical degree in 1981. Despite discouragement from the surgical faculty, Scantlebury completed her general surgery internship and residency at Harlem Hospital Center, finding a mentor in Dr. Barbara Barlow, head of the pediatric surgical department. While in her third year of residency, she began interviewing to select her specialty. After meeting with Dr. Mark M. Ravitch, one of the pioneers in the use of medical stapling in the US, at the University of Pittsburgh Children's Hospital, she was convinced to study pediatric transplantation. In 1986, Scantlebury began her fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) School of Medicine, under the direction of Dr. Thomas Starzl and spent the next two years in clinical work. First African-American woman transplant surgeon Between 1988 and 2002, Scantlebury worked as a transplant surgeon at the Pitt School of Medicine, earning her Doctor of Surgery in 1989, as the first African-American woman transplant surgeon. That same year, she married Dr. Harvey White, received the \\"Gift of Life Award\\" from the National Kidney Foundation and began teaching as an assistant professor at Pitt. In 1996, she was awarded the Carlow University Woman of Spirit, award for her inspiration to other women. Scantlebury worked her way up to associate professor by 2002 and was recruited by the University of South Alabama (USA) as a surgical professor and as director of the USA's Gulf Coast Regional Transplant Centre. Physician honors and recognition In 2003, she was honored as one of the \\"Best Doctors in America\\" and inducted into the Achievers Hall of Fame of the United Negro College Fund. In 2004 and 2006, she was listed as one of the \\"Top Doctors in America\\", and then in 2006 she began working with other transplant surgeons, the Coalition on Donation, and the National Minority Organ and Tissue Transplant Education Program in an endeavor called Linkages to Life to educate the black community and dispel myths regarding transplants. She was rewarded for her work by the Caribbean American Medical and Scientific Association and received the Order of Barbados Gold Crown of Merit. Kidney transplant program director Scantlebury accepted an offer from the Christiana Care Health System of Delaware in 2008 to serve as director of their kidney transplant program and the family relocated. In her career, Scantlebury estimates she has completed over 2,000 transplants, and has published more than 85 peer-reviewed research papers, as well as 10 monographs and several book chapters.

It is the result of considering how human bodies, spatial arrangements, physical objects, and technologies are entangled with language, interaction, and practices in organizing. Specifically, it examines the social and material aspects of technology and organization,Leonardi, P. M., & Barley, S. R. (2010). What‚Äôs under construction here? Social action, materiality, and power in constructivist studies of technology and organizing. but also emphasizes the centrality of materials within the communicative constitution of organizations. It offers a novel way to study technology at the workplace, since it allows researchers to study the social and the material simultaneously. It was introduced after legacies of contingency theory and structuration theory had characterized the field of Information System research in Management Studies.

From the 1990s onward, it was clear that because of a variety of information and communication technologies being adopted in the workplace, consideration of sociality and materiality in tandem would be met with increasing significance and academic attention. As was pointedly expressed by Barad, 'Language matters. Discourse matters. Culture matters. But there is an important sense in which the only thing that does not seem to matter anymore is matter.'Barad, K. (2003). Posthumanist performativity: Toward an understanding of how matter comes to matter. Signs, 28(3), 801-831. This critical statement is representative of not only the research most scholars in this field do focus on, but pushes forward what they are missing as a result: matter, or, the material. In directing attention toward the material, the theory of sociomateriality was generated. Early scholars like Joan Woodward and Charles Perrow were bearing a deterministic point of view in their study, and consider the materiality of technologies to be the sole cause of organizational changes. That first generation of research was conducted at a macro-level, with organizations as their unit of analysis. The following strand started looking at individuals as their subject of analysis, and as such, many informal aspects of organizational studies were also taken into account. That marked the emergence of social aspects appearing in scholarly papers about organizational technology‚Äîterms like ‚Äòtechnology-in use‚ÄôOrlikowski, W. J. (1995). LEARNING FROM NOTES: Organizational Issues in Groupware Implementation. Readings in Human‚ÄìComputer Interaction, 197-204. doi:10.1016/b978-0-08-051574-8.50023-6 and ‚Äòsocio-technological ensembles‚Äô.Bijker, W. E. (1997). Of bicycles, bakelites, and bulbs: Toward a theory of sociotechnical change. MIT press. This stream of thought takes a constructivist position. This position believes that the material features of technology does not matter too much, rather, the way people interpret technology holds the most significance. Both technological determinism and constructivism falls short in describing the whole picture of the relationship between technology and organizations. Then, scholars like Poole and DeSanctis, Monteiro and Hanseth, and Griffith started drawing attention toward technology's material features. Only then did it come to the \\"materiality\\" point-of-view, which is to say, the physical properties of technology drove workplace actions. However, the sole use of materiality to describe workplace technology also falls short in describing the whole picture. LeonardiLeonardi, P. M. (2012). Materiality, Sociomateriality, and Socio-Technical Systems: What Do These Terms Mean? How are They Related? Do We Need Them? SSRN Electronic Journal. explains the reason for sociomateriality's existence: '(a) that all materiality (as defined in the prior section) is social in that it was created through social processes and it is interpreted and used in social contexts and (b) that all social action is possible because of some materiality' (p. 32). The emergence of the term ‚Äúsociomateriality‚Äù is a sign of progress over \\"materiality\\", in the way that it recognizes that materiality constitutes the social world and the social world also influences technological materiality. Here, ‚Äúsocial‚Äù could be institutions, norms, discourses, and other human intentions. Given the growing popularity of materiality and sociomateriality in management and organization theories (e.g. Carlile, Nicolini, Langley, Tsoukas, 2013;Carlile, P. R., Nicolini, D., Langley, A., & Tsoukas, H. (Eds.). (2013). How matter matters: Objects, artifacts, and materiality in organization studies (Vol. 3). Oxford University Press.

Leonardi & Barley), sociomateriality has become \\"trendy\\" for theorists and researchers within other areas such as organizational communication. This is because it imparts a deeper understanding of the contextual, and relational, factors that shape, change and organize human behavior. Traditionally, concepts employed to study technology use at the workplace were adopted from advancements in philosophy and sociology, such as contingency theory, structuration theory and actor- network theory. However, sociomateriality is the first concept to be developed within the field of Information System (IS) studies, a division of management and organization theory. It has been argued that sociomateriality is 'the new black' of IS.Barad, K. (2007). Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. Barad explains that human actors and technological objects are understood to emerge in sociomaterial assemblages. Those assemblages are the results of agential cuts, which transform the boundary objects into temporally stabilized agencies. Approaches and methods in existing literature Orlikowski Orlikowski, W. J. (2007). Sociomaterial practices: Exploring technology at work.

The Academy of Management Annals (2)1, pp. 433-474. detailed paper aimed to bridge the theoretical gap seen in organization studies and management research journals by reviewing critical works on technology in order to create two research streams, before proposing a third emerging research genre, sociomateriality. They confront the issues with the existing literature by focussing on the arguments of several scholars over a period of three decades for both research streams. The result is a thoughtful call to action for scholars to regard how understudied technologies are within organizational research, despite their omnipresent nature. LeonardiLeonardi, P. M. (2009). \\"Why Do People Reject New Technologies and Stymie Organizational Changes of Which They Are in Favor?

His paper sheds light on understanding how technologies are implemented in the workplace‚Äîin organizations‚Äîwithout dismissing the human factor. Through use and interaction with technologies, there comes new organizational structure‚Äîor, at least, an added layer into preexisting structures or norms. Contractor, Monge and LeonardiContractor, N., Monge, P., & Leonardi, P. M. (2011). Network Theory Multidimensional Networks and the Dynamics of Sociomateriality: Bringing Technology Inside the Network. International Journal of Communication, 5, 39. use sociomateriality combined with actor-network theory, and developed a typology that brings technology into the network study. Existing literature already proves to be thought provoking in terms of understanding big issues, such as what is being compromised by sociomaterial practices, and how are values and assimilation procedures in organizations changing due to technological dependencies. Related literature and future directions Even in organizational literature at-large, the ideas and issues of sociomateriality are inadvertently present‚Äîwhich, in itself, warrants the need for further investigations solely through a sociomaterial lens. For instance, Catherine Turco's book The Conversational Firm: Rethinking Bureaucracy in the Age of Social Media is about the transformation of a traditional firm into a more open, non- hierarchical, technology-driven, and social \\"conversational firm\\".Turco, C. J. (2016). The Conversational Firm: Rethinking Bureaucracy in the Age of Social Media. New York: Columbia University Press. The discussions presented in her book‚Äîfrom online communication software to office space‚Äîintrinsically relate back to sociomaterial practices in the workplace. Most of the firm's successes, and even some failures, all reside in the relationship between the employees, their environment and the technology they use to communicate. These material practices not only change the ways in which communication happens within the firm, but it also changes the way employees behave outside of the office. Turco's ethnographic account of this firm provokes inquiry around the same separation‚Äîbetween technology and the process of organizing within firms‚Äîthat sociomateriality seeks to bridge. Outside of organization studies, technology theorists, such as Sherry Turkle, have written books that perhaps do not directly tackle sociomateriality, but have it on their horizon. Turkle's two books focus on the affordances, constraints and negative impacts of the social media age on human interactions and dialogue.Turkle, S. (2011). Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other. New York: Basic Books.Turkle, S. (2015). Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age. New York: Penguin. In his book, William Mitchell proposes, the \\"trial separation\\" of bits (the elementary unit of information) and atoms (the elementary unit of matter) is over. With increasing frequency, events in physical space reflect events in cyberspace, and vice versa, rendering a new urban condition‚Äîthat of ubiquitous, inescapable network interconnectivity. From such works, it is clear that an ethnographic approach to understanding sociomaterial practices is a way forward in the field, and one can presume many qualitative, empirical studies of this nature will be conducted over the years while organizations continue to evolve and change in light of new technologies. Without a clear research stream on sociomateriality, there will inevitably be a lack of 'understanding of how work is \\"made to work\\"'. Nonetheless, these authors are all adding to the new frontier in management and organization theories and research to understand the inextricable sociomaterial relationship between humans and technology. Despite its popularity in various disciplines, the theorizing of sociomateriality has been critiqued due to its less specific definition of technology and a neglect of broader social structures. In addition, it is believed that the theoretical perspective can benefit from a less obscure vocabulary and more coherent jargon use. In responding to the criticism, Scott and Orlikowski maintain that sociomateriality is a novel and innovative perspective, and scholars should strive to sustain the openness and experimentation in the framing of the theory.

In 2003 it was adapted into a film of the same name starring Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts. The novel is a comedy of manners detailing the relationship between the American Walker family and the French Persands and how the two families cope when they learn that there is to be a divorce in the family. Plot Isabel Walker is a twenty-something American film-school dropout who decides to visit her step-sister Roxanne, a poet who now lives in France. Isabel believes that she is there to help Roxanne during her pregnancy with her toddler infant, but later realizes that her father and step-mother sent her there so that Roxanne would help the shiftless Isabel gain some direction in life. Shortly after she arrives, Roxanne confides in Isabel that her French husband, Charles-Henri has left her. Roxanne's mother-in-law, Suzanne, tells Roxanne that her husband is probably having an affair because of her pregnancy and will return to her shortly after. Roxeanne struggles to decide what to do and finally decides to divorce Charles-Henri after learning he is having an affair with a woman named Magda Tellman. Roxanne becomes depressed by the end of her marriage and tries to commit suicide. She is found by Isabel, who successfully has her briefly hospitalized and only tells Charles-Henri about what happened. Charles-Henri is sympathetic but tells Roxanne he still wants a divorce. After some acrimony the couple decide to settle for an equal divorce where their assets will be divided in half. To her surprise Roxanne learns that a painting of Saint Ursula that was gifted her from the Walker side of the family might be worth several thousand dollars. In the meantime Isabel begins an affair with, Edgar, a septuagenarian who is Claude-Henri's uncle, after he gives her a Kelly bag and proposes she becomes his mistress. Isabel is attracted to his power and affluence and eventually believes she loves him. Eventually the Walker family realizes that the Saint Ursula painting is probably worth quite a bit of money and start to sue the family so that the sale can be blocked. They arrive in Paris to block the sale of the painting where they are introduced to Suzanne who tells them of Isabel's affair with Edgar, something Isabel's family find hilarious. Edgar quickly ends his relationship with Isabel shortly after. As the Walker's continue to try to block the sale of the painting they meet with an auctioneer from Christie's they learn that it is likely an original Georges de La Tour and is worth about a million dollars. Learning the news they return home only to find from Roxanne that Charles-Henri has decided to agree with Roxanne's wishes that the painting be left out of the divorce and instead be willed to their children. The rest of the family is incensed at Roxanne and demand she sell the painting. Shortly after Isabel joins her step-mother, Margeeve, Roxanne's mother-in-law Suzanne and their grandchildren take a trip to Euro Disney where Isabel is accosted by Magda's husband. Tellman kidnaps Suzanne, Margeeve and the grandchildren for seven hours but later releases them. Isabel returns home to Roxanne's and discovers that Tellman killed Charles-Henri and attempted to murder his wife, Magda. The Walkers realize that they can now go forward with the sale of the Saint Ursula painting without having to give anything to Charles-Henri's family. It sells for nearly two million dollars, which Isabel realizes 1/4 of which will go to her. Roxanne goes into labor the same day and gives birth to a boy she calls Charles-Luc after his father. At Charles- Henri's funeral Isabel reflects that Roxanne always gets what she wants and will now be treated as a valued member of the Persand family without the stain of divorce upon her.

He was born in St. John's, Newfoundland and educated at St. Bonaventure College before attending All Hallows College seminary in Dublin and St. Patrick's, Carlow College in Ireland. He was ordained in the Roman Catholic priesthood in 1913 at the Basilica of St. John the Baptist in St. John's, Newfoundland and enlisted in the Newfoundland Regiment in 1915 becoming the regiment's padre ultimately gaining the rank of lieutenant-colonel. While on furlough in 1917, he returned to St. John's, Newfoundland to deliver popular lectures about the experiences of the troops and calling for new recruits to join the war effort. Following the war, Nangle was appointed by the Dominion of Newfoundland's government as Director of War Graves, Registration, Enquiries and Memorials and also as the country's representative on the Imperial War Graves Commission in London and supervised the construction of memorials to Newfoundland soldiers in Newfoundland, including the National War Memorial in St. John‚Äôs at King‚Äôs Beach, and 15 war graveyards and memorials in Europe and Gallipoli including the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial in Beaumont-Hamel in France and four other similar parks in France and Belgium where the Newfoundland Regiment fought. While in London, he acted as the High Commissioner of Newfoundland to the United Kingdom from 1923 to 1924. In 1926, Nangle later left the priesthood, emigrated to Rhodesia in Africa where he became a farmer, married, and became active with the Reform Party, which he had helped found, and was elected in the 1933 election to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly as the MP for Salisbury District. He was defeated the next year in the 1934 election by Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia Godfrey Martin Huggins who ran against Nangle in his district. Nangle ran for the legislative assembly again in the 1946 and 1948 elections as a candidate for the Rhodesia Labour Party but was defeated. He died in Rhodesia in 1972 at the age of 83. A street in St. John's is named Padre Nangle Place in his honour, and in 2016, Nangle was named a National Historic Person.

Slaveholder and absentee plantation owner Pierce Mease Butler authorized the sale of approximately 436 men, women, children, and infants to be sold over the course of two days. The sale's proceeds went to satisfy Butler's significant debts, much of it from gambling. The auction is regarded as the largest single sale of enslaved people in U.S. history.  Pierce Mease Butler  The Butlers of South Carolina and Philadelphia were owners of slave plantations located on Butler Island (Butler Island Plantation) and St. Simons Island, just south of Darien, Georgia. The patriarch of the family, Major Pierce Butler, owned hundreds of slaves who labored over rice and cotton crops, thus amassing him the family's wealth. Butler was one of the wealthiest and most powerful slave owners in the United States. Upon his death, his biggest dilemma was which heir to leave his wealth. Estranged from his son, Major Butler left his estate to his two grandsons, Pierce Mease Butler and John A. Mease Butler. Pierce Mease Butler was devoid of business sense and his grandfather would not have approved of his personal habits. He frequently engaged in risky business speculations, which resulted in financial loss in the Crash of 1857, and his elaborate spending. However, it would be his incorrigible gambling that landed him in the most trouble. Butler had accrued a considerable amount of gambling debt over the years. To satisfy his financial obligations, the management of Butler's estate was transferred to trustees. At first, the trustees sold Butler's Philadelphia mansion for $30,000 as well as other properties but this was not enough to satisfy creditors. The only commodities of value that remained were the slaves he owned on his Georgia plantations.  The sale  Historical marker at Butler Island Plantation, erected by the Georgia Historical Society in 2019. Savannah was the perfect location for the auction due to its proximity to the Butler estate, and due to it being a large center for slave trade. Pierce Butler had the impending sale advertised in The Savannah Republican and The Savannah Daily Morning News by Joseph Bryan, a slave dealer in Savannah. The advertisements ran daily, except on Sundays, up until the last day of the sale. The text of some of the ads was, \\"For Sale, Long Cotton and Rice Negros! A gang of 440, Accustomed to the culture of Rice and Provisions, among them are a no of good mechanics and house servants, will be sold on 2nd and 3rd day of March at Savannah by J Bryan.\\" It was advertised and announced from the beginning that there would be no division of families. The slaves were brought to the race track 4 days before the auction started; allowing buyers and inspectors to take a look at them. On the first sale day, there were about 200 buyers present. Fierce rains kept many of the potential buyers away, and the auction began two hours late. During the day of the sale, Joseph Bryan was in charge of feeding the slaves, and keeping them in \\"good\\" condition. The slaves were kept in the horse barn stalls. All family members were put into the same stall. In the stalls they had nothing but the hardwood floors to sit and eat on. The slaves were given small portions of rice and beans, and sometimes cornbread, to eat over the two days. Skin color often played a role in the price a slave would sell for. In this sale it was not a factor, since all of these slaves were the color of their African ancestors. The slaves were skilled in their crafts, e.g. shoe making, cooperage, blacksmithing, carpentry. Some of the slaves had been taught to use machinery. The skilled slaves were sold for more, and were sought by the buyers during the auction. = The slaves = \\"Largest Slave Sale in Georgia History\\" Georgia historical marker, erected in Savannah in 2008 by the Georgia Historical Society. The slaves were brought to Savannah by steamboat and train, and were housed in the stables at the racecourse. They huddled together eating and sleeping on the floor. Beginning from February 26 through March 1, the slaves were inspected by prospective buyers. Anxious buyers from Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Louisiana descended upon Savannah in hopes of getting good deals. It was known that the Butler plantations had slaves who were skilled tradesmen, e.g. shoe making, cooperage, blacksmithing, carpentry, machine operators. The buyers poked, pinched, and fondled the slaves. They also opened their mouths inspecting their teeth. Slaves were also examined for \\"ruptures\\" or defects on their bodies that might affect their productivity. Four hundred and thirty-six persons were advertised in the sale catalogue, but only four hundred and twenty-nine were sold. Those not sold were either ill or disabled. The majority of those sold were rice and cotton fieldworkers; others were skilled coopers, carpenters, shoemakers, blacksmiths, and cooks. The two- day sale netted $303,850. The highest bid for a family, a mother and her five grown children, was for $6,180. The highest price for an individual was $1,750 whereas the lowest price was $250  The aftermath  Mortimer Thomson, a popular journalist during the time who wrote under the pseudonym \\"Q. K. Philander Doesticks\\" memorialized the event. Initially, Thomson traveled to Savannah infiltrating the buyers by pretending to be interested in purchasing slaves. After the sale, he wrote a long and scathing article describing the auction in the New York Tribune titled, \\"What Became of the Slaves on a Georgia Plantation.\\" Tom Pate, a Vicksburg trader, bought at the sale a man, his wife, and his two sisters with the guarantee that they were not to be separated in accordance with the terms of the auction. In disregarding the agreement, Pate sold one sister to a Pat Somers, a fellow trader, and the other sister to a private citizen in St. Louis. Somers finding out later of the sales agreement in Savannah about the families not being separated, returned the girl to Pate demanding his money refunded. An argument ensued resulting with Somers being shot and killed. Ten days following Somers's death, his nephew killed Pate, and he himself was killed during the confrontation. The feud continued until every man bearing the name Pate was killed. After the slaves were freed, some of them returned to Butler Island to work for wages and some bought land in the area.Ga. Hist.

Non-covalent interactions, such as hydrophobic interactions, œÄ-œÄ interactions, and hydrogen bonding, are among the responsible forces for the formation of those gels from small molecules. However, the main driving force for the formation of a metallogel is the metal-ligand coordination. Once the structure has been established, it resists gravitational force when inverted.Tam, A.; Yam, V. Recent Advances In Metallogels. Chemical Society Reviews 2013, 42, 1540.  Synthesis Method  Since the properties of gels depend on the type of non- covalent interactions involved, the metal-ligand interaction provide not only thermodynamic stability, but also kinetic liability. The general method for synthesizing gels is to heat the solution, which contains the metal ion being used and investigated, along with the ligand that will form the metallogel around it, as well as any other compounds used to create the appropriate conditions for the reaction to proceed well, until all added solids (depending on the type of gel prepared) are dissolved in the solvent used, and then cooling it down until the gels are self-assembled and properly formed.Mart√≠nez-Calvo, M.; Kotova, O.; M√∂bius, M.; Bell, A.; McCabe, T.; Boland, J.; Gunnlaugsson, T. Healable Luminescent Self-Assembly Supramolecular Metallogels Possessing Lanthanide (Eu/Tb) Dependent Rheological And Morphological Properties. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 1983-1992. However, this method has not shown favorable results with the additions of several transition metals, along with the use of lanthanides, in an acetonitrile nitrile solution of the ligand. In these studies, the ligand used is a 2,6-Bis(1‚Ä≤-alkylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine, due to its commercial abundance and the wide variety of synthetic pathways that allow the functionalization of this ligand, and therefore the chemical tuning of the metallogel. Therefore, under controlled heating and cooling conditions, the addition of a source of transition metals to the solution containing the ligand, along with lanthanide ions yielded stable gels, who have passed the inversion test. Self-assembling occurs from the influence of non-covalent interactions, as depicted in figure1. These linear, self-assembling compounds can continue to self-assemble forming columnar, helical structures that further aggregate to form bundles of fibers.Aparicio, Fatima; Sanchez, Luis. Thermodynamics of the Helical, Supramolecular Polymerization of Linear Self-Assembling Molecules: Influence of Hydrogen Bonds and p Stacking. Chemistry-A European Journal. 2013,19, 10482‚Äì10486. Another approach to form gels as functional nanomaterials, is the bottom up method used in subcomponent self-assembly. This method aims to save resources, shorten the time of synthesis, and offer a wider range of gels by the quick exchange of one of the reaction components.Bunzen, H.; Nonappa; Kalenius, E.; Hietala, S.; Kolehmainen, E. Subcomponent Self-Assembly: A Quick Way to New Metallogels. Chem. Eur. J., 2013, 19: 12978‚Äì12981. Chemical Structures of Self-Assembling Molecules  Examples  Although the synthesis method generally is the same, relying on the self-assembly of small molecules in the appropriate conditions, the metallogels differ mainly in the metal ion used, which directly influences their functions, chemical, optic, and electronic properties. Among numerous metal ions that are used, gold ions have been investigated for their wide variety of foreseen applications, as discussed in the applications section. They are further divided into two categories, based on the type of solvent used during the synthesis process. Gold Organometallogelators which are formed by Au(I) in trinuclear gold(I) pyrazolate complexes with long akyl chains, which appears as a red-luminescent organogel.Lima, J.C.; Rodr√≠guez, L. Supramolecular Gold Metallogelators: The Key Role of Metallophilic Interactions. Inorganics 2015, 3, 1-18. Gold Hydrometallogelators are made of glutathione and Au (III), which appear as a transparent gel. Firgure 2. Examples of Silver OrganometallogelatorsSilver metal ions also show properties of self-assembly, since they have high affinity to bind nitrogen, which can act as the driving force to form stable supramolecular structures. However, copper ions have a promiscuous nature that allows them to bind to a variety of ligands, which readily form stable metallogels with tunable properties, widening the scope of their applications. Bipyridines were among the most important ligands, since the formation of those metallogels can lead to research about the coordination of copper ions to DNA base pairs. Oxalic acid dihydrate is another important ligand, that easily forms stable structures when copper salts are added, which can be used as proton conductors.Saha, S.; Sch√∂n, E.; Cativiela, C.; D√≠az D√≠az, D.; Banerjee, R. Proton-Conducting Supramolecular Metallogels From The Lowest Molecular Weight Assembler Ligand: A Quote For Simplicity. Chemistry - A European Journal 2013, 19, 9562-9568. Furthermore, a bile acid‚Äìpicolinic acid conjugate can form gels in solvents that are 30%-50% organic. The increased water content renders this gel more bio-compatible, offering room for further investigation.Noponen, Virpi, Katri Toikkanen, Elina Kalenius, Riikka Kuosmanen, Hannu Salo, and Elina Siev√§nen. \\"Stimuli-responsive Bile Acid-based Metallogels Forming in Aqueous Media.\\" Steroids 97 (2015): 54-61. Web. 1 Mar. 2016. Palladium ions were among the transition metals used to form catalytic and irreversible metallogels, as well.(10) Xing B.; Choi M.; Xu B. Design of Coordination Polymer Gels as Stable Catalytic Systems. Chem. Eur. J. 2002, 8, 5028-5032. thumb  Applications  Metallogels obtain multi-responsive property to widely environmental responses. In particular, metallogels which are made of transition metal and lanthanoid are thermo-responsive,Weng, W.; Beck, J.; Jamieson, A.; Rowan, S. Understanding The Mechanism Of Gelation And Stimuli-Responsive Nature Of A Class Of Metallo-Supramolecular Gels. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 11663-11672. mechano-responsive,Beck, J.; Rowan, S. Multistimuli, Multiresponsive Metallo-Supramolecular Polymers. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 13922-13923. chemo-responsive, and photo-responsive. A metallogel system of Co/La shows inverse gel-sol transition when being heated to 100‚ÑÉ. When being heated, the orange color of solution remains unchanged suggesting the reaction of La/ligands only due to the heat. Such behavior is classified as thermo-response. Metallogels are also mechano-responsive. A system of Zn/La shows the formation of gel-like material upon addition of CH3CN as solvent followed by a gently shake. However, this metarial turns to transparent liquid after sitted for 20 seconds. As an example of a chemo- response, adding a small amount of formic acid to Zn/Eu will cause the breakdown of gel-like material as well as its mechanical stability and light- emission.Zhou Z.; Yan X.; Cook T.M.; Saha M.L.; Stang P.J; Engineering Functionalization in a Supramolecular Polymer: Hierarchical Self-Organization of Triply Orthogonal Non-covalent Interactions on a Supramolecular Coordination Complex Platform. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 806‚àí809. Different system of metal and lanthanoids show different emission bands on photoluminescent spectra. Co/Eu emits no band on the spectra due to presence of low energy metal of the system. Zn/La shows signal of metal-bound ligand- based at 397 nm while Zn/Eu shows signals of lanthanide metal at 581, 594, 616, 652 nm and signals of ligand at 397 nm indicating that the ligand is sensitive to metal biding. In addition to the multi-responsive properties, gold metallogels can prove to be useful in cosmetics, food processing, and lubrication. Those gels are used in drug delivery, to trap active enzymes and bacteria inside them. Furthermore, the basis of certain technologies, producing valves, clutches, and dampers, rely on the multi-responsive nature of metallogels to electric and magnetic stimuli. A recent study on metal organic gels involving Cadmium and Zinc ion shows promising results to absorb dyes, which emulates the ability of natural systems to get rid of toxic material that are difficult to decompose.Karan, Chandan Kumar, and Manish Bhattacharjee. \\"Self-Healing and Moldable Metallogels as the Recyclable Materials for Selective Dye Adsorption and Separation.\\" ACS Appl.

It is located in Ernakulam district of Kerala state, India. It is one of the most ancient Christian churches in India. It is believed that the church was founded on or before 4th century by a few Syrian Christian families who migrated from Paravur and Angamali. The new church established in AD 1338 by four Syrian Christian merchants who bought the entire land of Kothamangalam from a local chief for commodity trading with the nearby state of Tamil Nadu.  History  Kothamangalam was a major commercial city during the Portuguese period. The Marth Maryam church at Kothamangalam, commonly known as Valiyapally is the oldest of all the churches in the region. Present Kothamangalam region was historically known as Malakhachira (‡¥Æ‡¥æ‡¥≤‡¥æ‡¥ñ‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡¥ø‡¥±). The name came from a legend associated with Thomas the Apostle.

Gittendowne, is an openly gay African-American cartoonist, who created the first ongoing gay/lesbian-identified African-American comic-strip characters: the Brown Bomber (a teenage superhero) and Diva Touch√© Flamb√© (his ageless lesbian partner). Biography Rupert Kinnard was born in Chicago in 1954, and spent his early years living on the West Side. He moved with his parents and four sisters to a 16th-floor apartment in then-new housing projects, then to the South Side, where he attended Morgan Park High and later the Chicago Public Schools' High School for Metropolitan Studies. After graduating, he attended American Academy of Art. In 1972, teenage Kinnard noticed that not only were all of his favorite superheroes white, but even the comics characters he'd created himself didn't reflect his racial identity, and responded by creating Superbad, a Black-militant figure inspired by boxer/activist Muhammed Ali. In 1976 he enrolled at Cornell College in Iowa. In 1977, he created Brown Bomber, a less aggressive African-American character, modeled after boxer Joe Louis (who was also known by that nickname). The character was featured in a comic strip published weekly in the Cornellian, the college newspaper. After the character became popular on campus, Kinnard wrote a strip which identified the character as gay. He graduated from college in 1979, and moved to Portland, Oregon, where he began working for alternative newspaper Willamette Week, eventually as associate art director. In 1983 he co-founded Just Out, Oregon's first LGBT publication. In 1984 he created the lesbian African-American character Diva Touch√© Flamb√© and featured her with Brown Bomber in the strip \\"Cathartic Comics\\". He then became the first African American to serve on the board of the Portland Town Council, the state's first LGBT organization, and helped to establish The Diversity Alliance, a multicultural LGBT group. Upon moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1986, Kinnard served as art director for the San Francisco Sentinel, where \\"Cathartic Comics\\" began running as a weekly strip featured on the editorial page. In 1989 the strip began running in S.F. Weekly, and also appeared in gay publications in other major cities. A collection of the strips was published in 1992 by Alyson Books as B.B. and the Diva with a foreword by Marlon Riggs. After leaving S.F. Weekly, he became art director of Out/Look, a queer journal. After moving back to Portland in 1993 he and six other men formed the Portland chapter of Brother to Brother, a social organization for African-American queer men. In April 1996 Kinnard was involved in an automobile accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down, a day after attending his grandmother's funeral just outside of Jonestown, Mississippi. He and his partner Scott Stapley were among the plaintiffs in Martinez vs. Kulongoski, an unsuccessful 2008 court challenge to 2004's Oregon Ballot Measure 36, which defined marriage narrowly as the union of a man and a woman. Kinnard and Stapley own and operate the Kinley Manor Guest House in Portland. He is working on a graphic memoir, to be called The LifeCapsule Project.  Artistic influences and works  Rupert Kinnard (aka Prof. I.B. Gittendowne) with the Brown Bomber and Diva Touch√© Flamb√© Kinnard's influences include underground cartoonist Howard Cruse, quadriplegic cartoonist John Callahan, cartoonist and memoirist Alison Bechdel, filmmaker Marlon Riggs, poet Essex Hemphill, cartoonist Lynda Barry, and historian Allan B√©rub√©. Kinnard's writings, illustrations, and cartoons have been published in Meatmen: An Anthology of Gay Male Comics; A Queer Sense of Humor; The Indelible Alison Bechdel: Confessions, Comix, and Miscellaneous Dykes to Watch Out For; Juicy Mother; No Straight Lines; and in LGBTQ publications such as Portland's Just Out, Bay Area Reporter, Chicago's Windy City Times, and the literary lesbian and gay journal Out/Look magazine. Through his company The Rupe Group Graphics, Kinnard has worked with Portland's Black United Front, Portland Storefront Theater, PassinArt, Theater Group, the National Organization for Women, National Lawyers Guild, Cascade AIDS Project, the Workers‚Äô Organizing Committee, Oregonians Against the Death Penalty along with California Newsreel, Gay and Lesbian Press Association, National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association, Oakland Tribune and San Francisco's Theater Rhinoceros.  Awards and recognition  Two of Kinnard's publications received the National Gay Press Association award for best overall design: Just Out (1983) and the San Francisco Sentinel (1987). In 1992 his \\"Cathartic Comics\\" strip was featured as part of the San Francisco Cartoon Art Museum's \\"Black Ink: An Exhibit of African American Cartoonists\\", and original panels from it were included in the museum's permanent collection. The Brown Bomber and Diva Touch√© Flamb√© were portrayed on stage in 1994, in Out of the Inkwell, a Theater Rhinoceros production in San Francisco, also featuring characters from Doonesbury. He received Pride Northwest's \\"Spirit of Pride\\" award in 1996. In 1997 Kinnard took part in A Tip of the Nib, the nation‚Äôs first Lesbian and Gay Cartoonist conference, at Oberlin College, which also included artists Howard Cruse and Allison Bechdel. Kinnard's business The Rupe Group Graphics was awarded the Oregon Cascade AIDS Project‚Äôs Community Angel Award in 2007.

Currently, Andrew Lees holds 25 patents in the area of conjugate vaccines.  Personal Background  Andrew Lees is the son of two scientists, Marjorie and Sidney Lees. He was born and raised in Newton, MA, except for four years in Hanover, NH. He lives in Silver Spring, MD, and is married to Julie Pierson Lees. They have two children. Education Lees graduated from Newton North High School in 1971 as school valedictorian. He received his Bachelors of Science in Chemistry from Harvey Mudd College in 1976. After receiving his undergraduate degree Lees attended Johns Hopkins University and completed his Ph.D. in biophysics in 1984. Career = Early career = Lees was a post-doctoral fellow (1985-1988) in the laboratory of Dr. Howard Dintzis.http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/genbio/raven6b/graphics/raven06b/howscientiststhink/16-lab.pdf; M. A. Naughton, H. M. Dintzis (1962) Sequential biosynthesis of the peptide chains of hemoglobin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 48, 1822‚Äì1830. The work in the Dintzis‚Äô lab centered on the Immunon model of the immune cell signaling around the synthesis of multivalent peptide constructs. He subsequently moved to the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (Bethesda, MD) as a Research Instructor under Dr. Fred Finkelman and James J. Mond, although Lees‚Äô laboratory work was in the National Institutes of Health Laboratory of Immunology headed by William E. Paul. There, under the guidance of Dr. John Inman, Lees learned bioconjugation, the linking together of biologically relevant molecules to increase their utility. In 1992, Lees set up his own lab at the Uniformed Services University and it was there that he developed the CDAP chemistry for use in conjugate vaccines. The chemistry was licensed to GlaxoSmithKline through the Henry M. Jackson Foundation. From 1993-1999, Lees was also part-time at Virion Systems, Inc. (Rockville, MD) . Lees was appointed Associate Research Professor (Department of Medicine) at USUHS in 1998 and the School cited his work in vaccines in his Meritorious Service Award (1999). From 1999-2006 Lees was Director of Macromolecular Sciences at Biosynexus, Inc. = Current Work = Lees started the biotech company Fina Biosolutions LLC in 2006, where he currently serves as the CEO and Chief Scientific Officer. He was appointed an Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine Center for Vaccine Development in 2010.

Ghastly Grinning described the Anti-Recital experience as ‚Äú... casual and familiar, it‚Äôs a cocktail hour at a friend‚Äôs house, yet the dress code and lack of technology lends it a bit of finesse, a grace and dignity that calls to mind the feel of exclusivity, of being included in something much more intimate than a crowded show or auditorium screening meet-and-greet.‚Äù In August, Saar and Terrance announced that American Murder Song would be the opening act for the cello rock group Rasputina on their West Coast US tour.http://regenmag.com/news/rasputina-invites-american-murder-song-for-west- coast-tour/ The Rasputina tour was followed by the Anti-Recital tour in September, which sold out, prompting Terrance and Saar to book a ‚ÄúHardcore Encore,‚Äù taking the Anti-Recital to new stops in America and Canada, as well as debut performances in the UK, Netherlands and Germany.http://www.nightmarishconjurings.com/interviews/2019/1/3/interview- terrance-zdunich-and-saar-hendelman-for-american-murder-song-the-killing-place The Anti-Recital Hardcore Encore is scheduled to kickoff in February 2019.

She founded the International Study of Organized Persecution of Children (ISOPC) an organization that coordinated the psyologically informed interviews of over 1500 child survivors throughout much of the world. She was also the lead creator of the Kestenberg Movement Profile (KMP), used to create a psychological profile based exclusively on movement patterns.  Early life and education  Kesteneberg grew up in a wealthy Jewish industrialist family in Krak√≥w, who moved in 1924 from Poland to Vienna in 1924. She studied medicine at the University of Vienna and specialized in neurology and psychiatry. After receiving her doctorate in 1934 she began training at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, and in 1937 undertook a training analysis with Eduard Hitschmann.http://www.psyalpha.net/biografien/eduard-hitschmann/paul- federn-1931-eduard-hitschmann-60-geburtstag-28-juli-1931 bei psyalpha Concerned with the persecution of the Socialist Party of which she was a member, and interested in continuing her studies, Kestenberg emigrated in 1937 to New York City, where she worked with Paul Ferdinand Schilder at Bellevue Hospital in child psychiatry. For her psychoanalytic training Kestenberg studied at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and continued with Hermann Nunberg, who had also emigrated to escape the Anschluss. In 1943 she became a member and training analyst at the New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute. In 1942, Kestenberg married the lawyer Milton Kestenberg (1913-1991), who had left Poland in 1939. They had two children. She was Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine and also worked at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center. Kestenberg has published seven books and over 150 journal articles.  Kestenberg Movement Profile  Kestenberg, like other child psychiatrists, confronted the challenge of analyzing and helping very young children who had limited verbal skills. With her background in neurology, she believed that how a child moved could be a window into the child‚Äôs ways of feeling and thinking. Kestenberg began research in the early 1950s with the systematic observation of infants and their movement patterns. Through contact with Maria Ley-Piscator she learned the technique of Laban movement studies as it applied to questions in developmental psychology. She also began a long distance correspondence course with Warren Lamb (a student of Laban) in England to learn more about movement study. In 1980, Kestenberg invited psychiatrists and movement specialists to join with her in forming the Sands Point Movement Study group. They observed infants in various nurseries and she also spent a summer observing infants and children in a kibbutz in Israel. After many years of work, they developed the Kestenberg Movement Profile, a system of movement observation and analysis used to appraise individuals of all ages including the fetus. The system consists of 63 movement qualities portrayed in two series of diagrams, System I and System II. The System I diagrams focus on the feeling and substance of movement.Hastie, S. (2006). The Kestenberg Movement Profile. In S.L. Brooke (Ed). Creative Arts Therapies Manual: A Guide to the History, Theoretical Approaches, Assessment, and Work with Special Populations of Art, Play, Dance, Music, Drama, and Poetry Therapies. Illinois: Charles C. Thomas Publisher, LTD It includes a profile of temperament, learning styles, use of psychological defenses, cognitive patterns and ways of coping in space weight and time. System II diagrams consist of movements that provide the structure and shape for System I qualities. For example, if someone prefers to focus direct attention when they are studying or interacting with others, an enclosing gesture helps focus that direct attention.Kestenberg-Amighi J., Loman, S., Lewis, P., & Sossin, K. M. (1999). The meaning of movement: Developmental and clinical perspectives of the Kestenberg Movement Profile. New York, NY: Brunner-Routledge. As originally developed, profiles can trace the developmental foundation of movement and make psychological assessments that are psychodynamically informed.Loman, S. (1990). Introduction to the Kestenberg Movement Profile. In P. Lewis, & S. Loman, (Eds.). The Kestenberg Movement Profile: its Past, Present Applications, and Future Directions. Keene, NH: Antioch New England Graduate School, pp.52-64. Today, the KMP is still evolving, and has become an assessment and treatment guidance tool in the field of dance movement therapy.Loman, S. and Sossin, K. M. (2009).

Center for Parents and Children  In 1976,Buelte, A. (1992). Movement retraining. In S. Loman (Ed.). The body mind connection in human movement analysis. Keene, NH: Antioch New England Graduate School. Kestenberg and her colleague Arnhilt Buelte opened the Center for Parents and Children in Port Washington, New York. (The center later moved to Roslyn, New York.) There parents and children from birth to four years of age gathered to play and learn in a developmentally informed environment. Parents were able to meet and bond with other parents and children, creating long-lasting communities and friendships. But the principal purpose of the center was primary prevention. Psychiatrists, dance movement therapists and other professionals led the parents and children in play formulated to enhance and reinforce natural developmental patterns. The staff worked with parents to help prevent development disorders and resolve everyday issues. The center was also a place where the Kestenberg Movement Profile was used to help with assessment. Interns worked with the children and made movement profiles of mothers and children to inform work with children and parents. Based on movement understandings, they developed a method of movement retraining in order to support movement development and the interactions between parent and child from infancy.Lewis, P. (1990) The Kestenberg Movement Profile in the psychotherapeutic process with borderline disorders. In P. Lewis & S. Loman (Eds.), The Kestenberg Movement Profile, its past, present applications, and future directions. Keene, NH: Antioch New England Graduate School. The original structure and focus of the Kestenberg Movement Profile was based on the metapsychological profile developed by Anna Freud, with its strong emphasis on development. Presently, individual researchers, therapists, anthropologists and movement specialists use the KMP through the lens of their own frameworks.Loman, S. (1990). Introduction to the Kestenberg Movement Profile. In Lewis, P. & Loman, S. (Eds). The Kestenberg Movement Profile: its Past, Present Applications, and Future Directions. Keene, NH: Antioch New England Graduate School, pp. 52-64. Holocaust survivors In the 1970s Kestenberg was treating several patients in her psychoanalytic practice who were child survivors of the Holocaust. She recognized that these individuals were too young to fully remember their experiences, yet were traumatized by them. Many analysts encouraged them to forget, but they were unable to. So Kestenberg undertook a study of conditions of Jewish children during the Holocaust to help individuals recover their memories and combat their traumas. She also developed a system using reimagining kinesthetic sensations, such as of being held, to help adult survivors remember their parents who died during the Holocaust. She was co-founder of the Hidden Child Foundation as well. Kestenberg‚Äôs work led to greater recognition of child survivor syndromes and posttraumatic stress disorder. Kestenberg also became involved in working with the children of survivors, investigating the after effects of violent experiences on following generations. She pointed out that this phenomenon also occurs in the situation of children of the perpetrators.Kestenberg, J. S. (1992). Children of Survivors and Child of Survivors. Echoes Holocaust, 1, 27 - 50 With her husband, Milton, she founded the project International Study of Organized Persecution of Children (ISOPC) in which 1,500 interviews with children survivors were carried out. Among the key collaborators with Kestenberg, was Eva Fogelman and Helene Bass Wichelhaus co-directors of the project. Kestenberg also wrote several Holocaust related books for children, one of which was expressly for children of perpetrators. It was entitled, \\"When your grandparents were young.\\" She came to Germany in order to teach German children whose grandparents belonged to the generation of perpetrators of the Holocaust. In her view, the youngest children, had the most urgent need because they were just at the stage of developing a conscience. In the book exclusion and destruction are discussed, the grief of the survivors and the shame of the idler. In the book, the current situation in Germany and the slogan \\"Foreigners out!\\" is also addressed. In the epilogue, Kestenberg faces the question of whether young children can be told about the Nazi era, and how it can be done. She argues: \\"If we really want to prevent war, if we want to avoid the despising of strangers, then we must tell the children the truth - as early as possible.\\"Kestenberg, Judith. Child Survivors of the Holocaust. New York, N.Y.: Guilford Publications, 1988 Hidden Child Foundation In 1989, Myriam Abramowicz, director and co-producer of As if it Were Yesterday, approached, the Kestenbergs, Fogelman, and Jean Bloch Rosensaft with her vision to organize an international gathering of child survivors who had been hidden during the Holocaust. Hidden children were those who survived the Holocaust by being placed in convents, monasteries, orphanages, non-Jewish homes, or by hiding on their own with or without false identification in forests or in plain sight. Milton and Judith Kestenberg provided the initial funding necessary to plan the First International Gathering of Hidden Children, co-sponsored with the ADL, which happened in 1991. More than 1,600 hidden children and their families attended from all around the world. As a result, the Hidden Child Foundation was established, and local meetings and international conferences continue to this day.

Working primarily in what became Russian America, Zaikov would over the course of his career be employed by several groups of Russian fur merchants. Vladimir Zaikov at first worked for the Panov brothers, who also employed Evstratii Delarov. Zaikov departed from Okhotsk in 1772 aboard the Panov vessel Vladimir, staffed with 57 Russians and 10 Yakuts.Pallas, Peter Simon.

Seattle: University of Washington Press. 1948, p. 88. The winter was spent at the mouth of the Vorovskaya river on the Kamchatka Peninsula, where Vladimir remained until July 1773. Next the vessel went to Medny Island, spending the following year collecting food for the upcoming voyage.Makarova, Raisa A. Russians on the Pacific 1743-1799. ed. Richard A. Pierce and Alton S. Donnelly. Kingston, ON: Limestone Press. 1975, pp. 69-70. On 30 July 1775, Vladimir anchored at Attu Island, spending the following year collecting fur pelts in addition to ferrying 10 men to Agattu Island where they formed an artel for further fur exploitation. Departing from the Near Islands in July 1776, Zaikov reached Unimak Island in August, where he formed his base of operations until May 1778. While on the island, he forced the collection of the Yasak from 89 Aleuts, being later valued at ‚ÇΩ10,684. On the return voyage to Siberia, Zaikov wintered at Umnak Island, and in the following year Agattu was visited to gather the artel men left there. After crossing the Bering Sea, Vladimir reached Okhotsk on 6 September 1779 with 12 men having died during the multi-year voyage.Pallas (1948), p. 92. Profits amounted to ‚ÇΩ165,600 on the Okhotsk market, with the animal products primarily being over 3,800 Sea otter skins, almost 4,000 hides from various fox species, 1,725 Northern fur seal skins and 335 Walrus tusks.. Later career The next voyage Zaikov undertook was in the employ of a Tula businessman, commanding the Sv. Pavel with a crew of 70 Promyshlenniki.Pierce, Richard A. Russian America: A Biographical Dictionary. Kingston, Canada: The Limestone Press. 1990, pp. 550-551. Departing Okhotsk in 1781, the crew wintered at Bering Island. The following year was spent among the Fox Islands, where active trade with the native Aleuts was commenced. In July 1783, Sv. Pavel was located in the Prince William Sound, where a skirmish arose with Chugach indigenous that left 8 of the crew dead. Throughout the remainder of the 1780s, Zaikov remained based on Unalaska Island. During his time there the Spanish Empire was actively exploring the region. He would meet several Spanish explorers in 1788, Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez commanding the La Princesa and Gonzalo L√≥pez de Haro of the San Carlos. Zaikov died on Unalaska Island in 1791.

Gellius, though, never qualified for advanced courses in philosophy, and his dialogues involving Taurus contain some literary embellishments. In these, advice and reprimands aimed at character formation play an important role. In formal education, Taurus permitted his students the liberty to ask questions.Gellius: Noctes Atticae 1,26,2. The picture that Gellius paints of his tutor is that of a mild, friendly and well-educated man, equipped with a thorough knowledge of the Platonic dialogues. He lamented the decline of education, amateurism and the arrogance of those who only pretended to be interested in serious education. Following Platonic tradition, he distanced himself from rhetoric, in which he saw a deviation from the actual problems of philosophy. He especially disliked the lack of philosophical interest of those who sought to be tutored by him, holding as an example of superficiality a prospective student whose only reason to be interested in Plato was to improve his verbal skills.Gellius: Noctes Atticae 1,9,8‚Äì11. Works The Suda attributes to Taurus a treatise On the Distinction between the Theories of Plato and those of Aristotle (Peri tƒìs t≈çn dogm√°t≈çn diaphor√°s Pl√°t≈çnos kai Aristot√©lous) and one On the Material and the Immaterial, among other works. According to Gellius, Taurus wrote extensive commentaries to Plato's dialogues (in particular, Gorgias and Timaeus) as well as a text in which he critiqued Stoic philosophy form a Platonic standpoint and pointed out contradictions in Stoic thought. He also wrote a work, now lost, on wrath, which he described as a disease. It is uncertain whether this was a treatise devoted to this single topic. A commentary on Plato's Republic, attributed to a certain Taurus of Sidon, was probably written by Calvenus Taurus. All of Taurus's works are lost, except for some fragments of his commentaries on Timaeus and the Republic. Philosophy Like many Platonists, Taurus held the conviction that the world was eternal and un-created. From this he concluded that the account of creation in Plato's Timaeus was to be read as a metaphor, intended only as a didactic device. He considered various metaphoric readings of Plato's text and listed four non-temporal meanings of the word genƒìt√≥s (\\"created\\", \\"become\\"). He favored an interpretation in which the created nature of the world exists in its character as a process: the cosmos was only created insofar as it is ever changing, never ceasing to become. Taurus refused to obscure the differences between Plato and Aristotle; he defended Platonism with religious fervor against the Stoics and Epicureans. He particularly rejected the Stoic ideal of apatheia, defending instead the Platonic and peripatetic concept of metriopatheia (moderation). In his critique of Stoicism he followed Plutarch, whose work he admired and cited regularly. His relation to Aristotelian philosophy was not one of total rejection: despite differences of opinion, he used Aristotle's writing in his teaching.

First portrayed by Beverlee McKinsey from 1972 until 1980, Iris was one of the show's most iconic characters and received her own short-lived spin- off, Texas. Carmen Duncan took over the role from 1988 until 1994. Casting Having previously appeared on Another World as Emma Frame in May 1972, Beverlee McKinsey so impressed Harding Lemay (then-head writer), he created the role of Iris for her to return. Manipulative and scheming Iris was a staunch contrast to meek and dowdy Emma. Character history =Backstory= Iris was a glamorous socialite who traveled the world looking for excitement. She had a happy and privileged childhood as the daughter of wealthy publisher, Mac Cory and his wife, Emily. Iris was the product of an affair between Mac and Sylvie Kosloff. Sylvie was sent to prison while pregnant with Iris. She asked Emily to adopt her daughter and she agreed. Iris grew up believing Emily was her birth mother, while Mac believed Iris was adopted. While being pursued by Eliot Carrington (James Douglas), Iris had a brief fling with Alex Wheeler (Bert Kramer), who eventually left her. Upon discovering she was pregnant with Alex's child, Iris accepted Eliot's marriage proposal so her child could have a father. She gave birth to a son named Dennis (Mike Hammett). Iris grew tired of domestic life and left Dennis and Elliot to return to globe-trotting. =Life in Bay City= Iris arrived at Eliot's New York City apartment to find a beautiful woman by the name of Alice Talbot (Jacqueline Courtney) working as Dennis's nanny. Eliot was pursuing Alice and Iris schemed to break the two up since she had been hoping for a reconciliation. Dennis was diagnosed with a heart condition and Eliot took him to Alice's hometown of Bay City to receive treatment. Iris also moved there and was soon joined by her beloved father. Iris loved Mac to the point of desperation and believed she should be the number one priority in his life. Mac decided to stay in Bay City and set up an office of his publishing house, Cory Publishing, much to Iris's delight. Dennis recovered and Eliot left town, leaving him with Iris. Iris began dating Dr. Russ Matthews (David Bailey), who had taken care of Dennis. Iris set Mac up with Russ's aunt, Liz Matthews (Irene Dailey). Liz and Mac dated for a short time, but it was another, much younger woman who stole his heart: Rachel Frame (Victoria Wyndham). Iris was disgusted that her father had fallen in love with a lower-class woman like Rachel, who was younger than Iris no less. Nonetheless, Mac and Rachel married. Iris spent the next few years doing just about everything to break them up, including hiring Long Island playboy Philip Wainwright (James Luisi) to try and seduce Rachel and encouraging Mac's ex- girlfriend Tracy DeWitt (Caroline McWilliams) to woo him away from Rachel. All of Iris's schemes blew up in her face and drove a wedge in between her and Mac. Russ had also grown tired of Iris's antics and broke off their engagement. Rachel became pregnant and, one day, felt sharp pain in her abdomen. When she called out to Iris for help, Iris ignored her and Rachel had a miscarriage. When Mac discovered this, he disinherited Iris. Iris set her sights on an architect named Robert Delaney (Nicolas Coster), who was dating Clarice Hobson (Gail Brown). When they broke up, he and Iris got together. Iris found out that Clarice was pregnant with Robert's baby, but she still married him. Iris told Clarice to keep her mouth shut about her child's paternity and terrorized the helpless woman with threats of taking her baby away from her forever. When Robert discovered her deception, he left her. Dennis became ill again, leading to Mac and Iris reconciling. Iris began dating attorney Brian Bancroft (Paul Stevens). Brian did not treat Iris like the other men she had been with had treated her. He did not try to change her but at the same time called her out on her behavior. They eventually got married. Rachel gave birth to Iris's little sister, Amanda (Nicole Catalanotto). It was revealed by Mac that Iris was adopted when she heard him say that Amanda was his firstborn child. Iris was devastated by this revelation. She decided to find her birth parents and eventually tracked down her birth mother, Sylvie Kosloff (Leora Dana). Although she was disappointed to learn that Sylvie was lower-class, the two managed to form a solid relationship. Around the same time, Iris met Kirk Laverty (Charles Cioffi) and they began an affair. Kirk wanted to take over Cory Publishing and convinced Iris to vote against Mac in a takeover bid, but Kirk's plan backfired. Kirk was murdered by Jeff Stone (Dan Hamilton), but it was Iris who became the number one suspect. Luckily, she was able to clear her name. Iris also managed time to interfere in her son's life. She was horrified when she found out Dennis (now played by Jim Poyner) was having an affair with a much older Elena DePouglinac (Christina Pickles). She tried to set him up with Elena's daughter, Cecile DePouglinac (Susan Keith). However, Cecile wanted Iris's stepbrother (Rachel's son), Jamie Frame (Richard Bekins), who was also Dennis's best friend. Iris paid a woman to seduce Jamie away from Cecile so Dennis could have her. Cecile found out and told Brian, who asked Iris for a divorce because he was tired of her manipulations. Dennis moved to Houston, Texas to become an art buyer for a gallery. =Life in Texas= Iris joined Dennis in Texas not long after his move. While there, she ran into her former lover, Alex Wheeler. The two reignited their love affair and Iris revealed that Alex was Dennis's father, not Eliot, leaving Dennis devastated. Iris and Alex married however, but he died less than a year later. Alex had helped quell Iris's conniving ways, but after his death Iris became bitter and vengeful yet again. She zeroed her rediscovered vindictiveness in on Dennis's new wife Paige Marshall (Lisby Larson), with whom Iris shared an already contentious relationship. Unearthing Paige's past as a porn star, Iris schemed to use the information to drive Paige out of town, but it only led to the appearance of Paige's seedy former lover Chris Shaw (Benjamin Hendrickson), who had forced a young Paige into making illicit underground films years before in New York City. Eventually, Shaw was murdered, with Iris, Paige and Dennis as the leading suspects. When this situation was cleared up, Iris found herself receiving the arrival of Alex's younger brother Grant Wheeler (Donald May), who took over Alex's world wide oil company and settled his own family into Texas. Needing a fresh start, Iris handed the Wheeler mansion over to her brother-in-law and left Texas, returning yet again to her globe-trotting, socialite ways. =Iris returns= Iris (now played by Carmen Duncan) returned to Bay City in 1988. Mac was happy to see his daughter again while Rachel still had her reservations about Iris. Iris came back with some surprising news: the previous year she had visited Sylvie, who was on her deathbed, and she had revealed that Iris was in fact Mac's biological daughter. This made Iris more determined than ever to win over her father once and for all. Iris began scheming as soon as she arrived in Bay City. She hired her lover, Evan Frame (Charles Grant), to seduce a married Amanda (now played by Sandra Ferguson) to disgrace her in Mac's eyes. This planned failed when Evan felt guilty and confessed everything to Amanda. She set up a fake company called Bennett Publishing to bring Cory Publishing to the brink of destruction so she could rush in, save it, and make Mac proud. The only thing that was known about this mysterious publishing house was that it was run by someone called \\"The Chief.\\" Rachel teamed up with Donna Hudson (Anna Stuart) to discover The Chief's identity. Once it was discovered it was Iris, Rachel confronted her and demanded she tell Mac. Iris tearfully told her father the truth. Mac was furious and disowned Iris yet again. He died of a heart attack shortly afterward. Iris was devastated that her father never forgave her before his death. Mac did not completely disown Iris since he left her large shares in Cory Publishing. However, he also left equal shares to Rachel and Amanda. Rachel and Iris battled over who would become CEO. When the vote came down it was a tie between Rachel and Iris and it was none other than Jamie's estranged wife, Vicky (Anne Heche), who could break the tie. Vicky voted for Iris since Rachel had refused to give her custody of her and Jamie's son, Steven. Iris became CEO of Cory Publishing, proudly continuing on her father's legacy. A complication arose when a woman named Paulina Cantrell (Cali Timmins) arrived in Bay City and claimed to be Mac's daughter. Iris did not want another person to battle over her family's wealth. She paid Jake McKinnon (Tom Eplin) to prove Paulina was a liar. By this time, Rachel and Iris were on good terms and she did not want Rachel to know about her scheme against Paulina, who Rachel had welcomed into the family. Jake blackmailed Iris, telling her he would expose her to Rachel if she did not pay up. When Jake was shot, Iris was a one of many suspects. Jake's ex-wife, Marley Hudson (Anne Heche), was charged with his attempted murder. It turned out that Paulina had shot him, but this was never exposed, because rather than turn her in, Jake blackmailed Paulina into marriage to get his hands on the Cory fortune. At their wedding, Iris acknowledged Paulina (now played by Judi Evans) as her sister, though she was disgusted that Jake was now a part of her family. Dennis (now played by Chris Bruno), who Iris had had limited contact with over the years, came to town for the wedding and he agreed to start over with his mother. For a long period of time, Iris mellowed out. She formed a close relationship with Dennis and got along well with her family. She dated Spencer Harrison (David Hedison) for a year, but they broke up when they realized they did not want a commitment from each other. Iris next began dating Hank Kent (Steve Fletcher), who was unlike any man Iris had ever been with. He was working-class and unimpressed with Iris's high-class lifestyle. Iris formed a close bond with Hank's young son, Tommy (Cory Lee Rogers), who playfully called her \\"I.W.\\" Iris tried to settle into a domestic life with the Kents, but it soon became apparent it was not for her. Overtime, Iris became so caught up with her family's problems that Hank had enough and broke off their engagement. Iris also became a grandmother when Dennis had a baby with Russ's daughter, Olivia Matthews (Allison Hossack). At first, she did not like the idea of Dennis having a baby with Olivia, who she believed was a gold digger, and tried to pay her off. When Iris saw how much Dennis wanted to be in the baby's life, she became more supportive. Olivia left town and gave birth to their daughter, Sarah. Iris comforted Dennis, who was devastated he could not see his daughter. Iris was enraged when Rachel fell in love with the Cory family's sworn enemy, Carl Hutchins (Charles Keating). When Rachel and Carl announced their engagement, Iris plotted to ruin their wedding. She decided to fire blanks at Carl while he stood at the altar to scare him. Her plan went horribly wrong when a newly returned Evan (now played by Eric Scott Woods) put real bullets into her gun. Iris ended up actually shooting Carl and almost killing him. She was arrested and charged with attempted murder. She was found guilty and sentenced to eight years in prison.

The text is classified as one of 13 Shaiva Upanishads, and one of the 32 Upanishads of the Krishna Yajurveda. The Upanishad glorifies Shiva, with Vedanta nondualism terminology. The text is notable for its focus on Sadashiva,as Brahman,with his five faces corresponding to five Ishwaras, and for its recommendation of meditation on \\"So'ham\\" or \\"I am he, He am I\\" to achieve moksha, the union with Brahman.Carl Olson (1997), The Indian Renouncer andPostmodern Poison: A Cross- cultural Encounter, P Lang, , page 139 History The date or author of Pancabrahma Upanishad is unknown. Kramrisch states that this is a late text, but possibly one which was composed before the Vishnudharmottara Purana. She dates the latter to about 7th-century CE, contemporary with Ajanta Caves paintings.Stella Kramrisch, The Vishnudharmottara Part III: A Treatise On Indian Painting And Image-Making, 2nd Edition, Calcutta University Press, page 5 Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Panchabrahma Upanishad and Pancabrahmopanishad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 268, 449‚Äì450 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed as Pancabrahma Upanishad at number 93. This text is not a part of the 17th century compilation of 50 important Hindu Upanishads published by Mughal Era Dara Shikoh and of the 18th-century anthology of 52 Upanishads published by Colebrooke, nor is it found in the Bibliotheca Indica anthology by Narayana. As an Upanishad, it is a part of the corpus of Vedanta literature collection that present the philosophical concepts of Hinduism.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 1, Oxford University Press, page LXXXVI footnote 1, 22, verse 13.4 Contents The text opens with sage PaippalƒÅda asking Shiva, \\"what is that which came to exist first?\\" Shiva's reply is structured as the verses of Pancabrahma Upanishad. The Pancabrahma Upanishad describes five forms of realities (Brahman) or Shiva that arose from highest reality ‚Äì Sadyojata, Aghora, Vamadeva, Tatpurusha and Ishana. He is panchatmak, who conceals all five Brahmas, and to realize him is moksha. The Ishana, asserts the text, is the highest form of Brahman, unmanifested impeller, adorned with Om, and that all five Brahmas resolve into the supreme Nirguna (formless) Brahman. The supreme shines by its own light, beyond the five Brahmas, states this Pancabrahma text. The Sadyojata represents earth and is associated with Kriya Sakti (power of action), asserts the text. The Aghora represents fire and drives the Iccha Sakti (power of will, desire) and Vamadeva represents water and impels the Jnana Sakti (power of knowledge). Tatpurusha represents air and is the power of life (breath, prana), while Ishana represents ether-space and the transcendental. The Pancabrahma Upanishad, states Teun Goudriaan, focuses on these symbolism behind the five faces of Shiva and mystical equations about all except Ishana face. The Ishana face of Shiva is glorified with general epithets such as \\"superior to the pacified\\", as \\"Brahman\\", as \\"Supreme\\", as \\"lustre behind everything\\", and as \\"I myself am that Brahman\\", thus emphasizing his fundamental position in this text. The verse 23 of the manuscript asserts that one must meditate on Shiva within, with \\"So'ham\\" or \\"I am He, He am I\\" to achieve moksha, the union with Brahman. This outlook of this text corresponds to Advaita Vedanta position of Hindu philosophy, states Goudriaan. Five-faced Shiva from 10th century Cambodia. The Ishana face is at the top. This Upanishad, states Kramrisch, gives precedence to the \\"power of knowledge\\", in contrast with some Shaiva text such as Vatulasuddh-agama which emphasize \\"power of will\\". According to Kramrisch, this may be either doctrinal differences or possible errors in transmission of the manuscripts over the centuries, but the components of Shavism ontology are consistent across the texts, since the latter part of the 1st-millennium CE. The text, adds Kramrisch, asserts that \\"all this phenomenal world is the Parabrahman, Shiva, of the character of the fivefold Brahmans\\", and that everything in a being's inner and outer senses, that falls within or lies beyond, is Shiva of fivefold Brahman character. The seeker realizes that aspect of five Brahman Shiva, in accord with the strength of his vision, his spiritual development, and it is Shiva who is in the heart of all beings, Shiva is Sat-Cit-Ananda, meaning existence, consciousness, and Bliss. Shiva is the liberator, asserts the text. Reception The pancabrahma concept found in this Upanishad is also found in the ≈öaivƒÅ Agamas, described in a similar way.Mark S. G.

A Hyder flare is slow, large-scale brightening that occurs in the solar chromosphere.Space Weather Services: Hyder Flares at the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology; retrieved February 6, 2016 It resembles a large but feeble solar flare and is identifiable as the signature of the sudden disappearance of a solar prominence (a \\"disparition brusque\\"). These events occur in the quiet Sun, away from the active regions or sunspot groups, and typically in the polar crown filament zone. Hyder flares have a two-ribbon morphology and can be faintly observed in chromospheric emission lines such as HŒ± or as enhanced absorption in He I 1083 nm line. Hyder flares are caused by the unstable eruption of a magnetic filament channel; the filament rises and may escape from the Sun as a part of a coronal mass ejection, and the visible flare marks the magnetic connectivity of the coronal disturbance. Unlike solar flares, Hyder flares take a much longer time to reach peak intensity, as much as 30 to 80 minutes and then can continue for several hours. They have not caused any interference with Earthly communications like solar flares, and are rather weak. The discovery of Hyder flares has been mainly associated with Charles Hyder who developed the mechanism describing them in 1967. Some disagree with Hyder's findings and his mechanism, on what actually produces the flare. Although rare, a notable occurrence that took place November 1, 2014, confirmed that they display special characteristics distinguishing them from solar flares.Space.com: Hyder Flares November occurrence of rare Hyder flare; retrieved February 6, 2016 Cause The explanation for these solar flares comes from Hyder's two-fold observations. One, flares tended to have a parallel ribbon shape to them with one on either side of the filament channel. Two, these flares were not caused by or associated with geomagnetic storms. Quiescent filaments have been believed to belong to a magnetic trough, which can disappear due to the field's reconfiguration. When this happens, the filamentary material is said to be thrown into the corona, creating a typical solar flare. Hyder explains that the process for Hyder flares differs, in that sometimes the filamentary material instead cascades down the outer sides of the elevated magnetic trough, or ridge, to interact with the lower chromospheric material that is producing the flare. If this falling process is not symmetrical on either side, then there will be a double parallel ribbon shape form, whereas a symmetrical fall will produce only a single parallel ribbon. A sporadic or insufficient fall of filamentary material will cause bright knots of solar flares to be produced. History Hyder flares were first noted by Max Waldmeier in 1938, who wrote a paper describing the phenomenon of suddenly disappearing filaments (disparition brusque), and mentioned that these can be associated with flare-like brightenings, but it was left to Charles Hyder to postulate the first comprehensive mechanism for such flares.Solar Physics: Volume 2 from Solar Physics, Volume 2, Issue 3, pp.267-284 of the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS); retrieved February 6, 2016 Following on work from his doctoral thesis with the University of Colorado in Boulder (1964), Hyder published two papers in the second volume of the journal Solar Physics (1967) in which the mechanism by which Hyder flares might occur was discussed in detail. Hyder was then on the staff of the (US) Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories at the Sacramento Peak Observatory in New Mexico. It was these papers in Solar Physics by which Hyder's name became associated with the flares in question, even though he was by no means the first to observe them. Occurrences As Hyder flares are notably rare, few occurrences have been recorded since their discovery, the first being on August 31, 2012, the second being on June 4, 2014. This solar flare occurred in the Southeastern Galactic quadrant. This flare spanned more than . It was recorded to have happened around 14:30 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). After the flare took place, solar activity was low for 24 hours. Another occurrence took place later that year on November 1, 2014. This flare was defined as a C-Class flare and happened between 0400 and 0600 UTC. Scientists noted that some material was sent back into the sun, which then caused several flashes of x-rays wherever they hit the surface of the sun. The remaining material flew out into space that formed a large core of Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) and gravitated away from the sun. It was not projected to hit Earth. Unlike the flare of June 2014, solar activity was high after the event even when no sunspots were detected.Description of November 1st Occurrence November occurrence of rare Hyder flare; retrieved February 6, 2016 Hazards/controversy Despite their size, Hyder flares generally do not have a high intensity. It is commonly accepted that there is no immediate threat to Earth from a solar flare 93 million miles away. These flares can potentially affect space weather, however, which could disrupt electronics. Because of this, many precautions must be taken into account to prevent damages to airplane navigation and/or government technologies.Science Daily: Solar Flare from NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center published on Science Daily; retrieved February 6, 2016 Recently, the Hyder mechanism has come under question, most notably by Harold Zirin. Zirin questioned the filament falling down the side of the magnetic ridge, stating that magnetic reconfigurations will always create ejection. Comparisons to Hyder's 1968 publications were discussed in Harold Zirin and D.

It is one of several ways for a college to assess an applicant along with grade transcripts and standardized scores and essays.Note: college interviews usually last 20 minutes to a half hour Interviews can take place on the college campus, at the high school (if the college sends representatives), and elsewhere such as at a local coffee shop if there is an interview between a student and an alumnus. In addition, several colleges have been experimenting with online interviews. If offered by a college, interviews are sometimes described as optional, but one report suggested that not doing an interview when one was offered could hinder chances for admission. Further, doing an interview signals an interest in attending. Likely interview questions include: #Can you tell me a little about yourself? #Why are you interested in our college? #What are you interested in studying? #How will you contribute to our campus community? #What do you see yourself doing ten years from now? Counselors and teachers and professional consultants offer differing guidelines about interviews. Most suggest that an interviewee should \\"dress to impress\\", avoid wearing provocative or inappropriate clothes, although a report in 2009 suggested that hiring a fashion consultant and shopping for expensive clothes before an interview was unnecessary and could backfire. There is strong consensus that rehearsing for interviews is important. Former Andover theater instructor and professional interview coach Mark Efinger believes that preparation is vital for a successful interview. Sometimes assistants help students prepare for the interview. Private secondary schools such as St. Paul's in New Hampshire have a two-week \\"boot camp\\" in the summer before senior year to help students prepare which includes simulated practice interviews. Efinger advises students to write up their major achievements, organize them into themes, and have a three to five minute theme-oriented \\"success story\\" ready (but not memorized) before an interview, and suggests that interviewees should try to steer the conversation to show how their skills and experience meet criteria valued by the interviewer. For example, if trying to demonstrate an aptitude for \\"planning and organization\\", he or she might show how they plan their schedule using their mobile scheduling app. Advisers agree that a usual open-ended question to begin the interview will be along the lines of \\"tell me about yourself\\", and that a student should be ready with a response. Several emphasize the importance of being able to back up adjectives such as \\"hardworking\\" and \\"motivated\\" with a brief and memorable anecdote to explain further what is meant. Efinger describes such anecdotes as \\"arrows\\" designed to \\"hit the bull‚Äôs-eye\\" to make a point which sticks in the interviewer's mind; in addition, interview preparation can include a private soul-searching exercise called a \\"failure resume\\" to get students to think about their past mistakes in order to help them outline what they learned from their experience. It helps for students to understand what they want and to show how a particular college can help them achieve their long range goals. While interviews can be stressful, one report suggested that the main purpose of the interview was to \\"show that you are a good person\\" who is \\"polite and interesting\\" with a \\"sense of humor\\". Another report suggested the most important thing, when an applicant has strong grades and test scores and activities, is simply not \\"blowing the interview\\", although this varies by college.

Early  Bosler's father was a maritime engineer, and her early years were spent relocating frequently along the eastern coast. At seven years old, she moved to Great Neck, Long Island, and was enrolled into ballet classes by her mother, who was concerned about her daughter's posture. For three years, Bosler studied with Mikhail Mordkin and the Swobodas before moving to New London, Connecticut, where her dance studies halted until high school.Dance Magazine, September 1957, pg. 40 - \\"Virginia Bosler\\" by Saul Goodman Virginia Bosler (middle) at Jacob's Pillow (summer 1943)  Dance training  Bosler resumed her dance training while attending the progressive Cherry Lawn High School in Darien, Connecticut, focusing on modern and folk dancing under Hanya Holm prot√©g√©e, Laura Morgan. She first attended the renowned Jacob's Pillow in Becket, Massachusetts, at the age of 15 between her sophomore and junior years of high school. Bosler returned for the following two summers as a scholarship student; dancing in the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, learning Pilates directly from its creator, Joseph Pilates, and earning the respect of Jacob's Pillow founder, Ted Shawn. left After what Bosler considered a ‚Äúdisastrous‚Äù\\"Dance On\\" broadcast from June 17, 1984.

Produced by Video Workshop for Dance and Theatre year at Barnard College, she left school to pursue a dance career. She studied with Hanya Holm as well as Cia Fornaroli and Merce Cunningham. Bosler's big break came in the spring of 1946 when she was cast in the tour of Bloomer Girl, choreographed by Agnes de Mille and starring Nanette Fabray. After observing Bosler's performance in the tour over the next nine months (which took her to cities such as Toronto, Boston, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC), de Mille requested that she fly to New York while on the Pittsburgh tour stop to audition for the upcoming Alan Jay Lerner/Frederick Loewe show, Brigadoon.  Roles  Virginia Bosler in Leonard Sillman's New Faces of 1952Bosler originated the role of Jean MacLaren in Brigadoon (1947), a role she would play for over a year and a half on Broadway, for another year on tour, and repeat in the 1954 film adaptation (though her role was drastically reduced from the stage version). Bosler would go on to perform on Broadway from 1950 to '51 in the Agnes de Mille-directed Cole Porter musical Out of This World (choreographed by her former teacher Hanya Holm, and starring Charlotte Greenwood), later appearing in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (as a replacement and member of the closing cast in 1951); the flop musical A Month of Sundays (starring Nancy Walker), which closed out of town in January 1952; and Leonard Sillman‚Äôs New Faces of 1952 (1952‚Äì1953).left Though officially a member of the Agnes de Mille Dance Theatre for a national tour from 1953 to 1954, Bosler was absent for a large portion of the engagements as she was filming Brigadoon from December 1953 to March 1954 in Culver City. Just as the film of Brigadoon premiered in September 1954, Bosler returned to Culver City to shoot her scenes for the film version of the Richard Rodgers/Oscar Hammerstein II stage hit, Oklahoma!, for which Agnes de Mille recreated and adapted her original stage choreography. Both Brigadoon and Oklahoma! are notable for being two of the few motion pictures shot twice during principal photography using separate cameras and ‚Äútakes‚Äù to accommodate the new experimental widescreen processes of CinemaScope and Todd-AO, respectively. As such, different versions of both films exist using the same prerecorded songs, though it is unclear whether the ‚Äúflat‚Äù version of Brigadoon was ever released (it isn't available on home video). Virginia Bosler in Oklahoma! (1955) A European stage tour of Oklahoma! (headlined by Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy) followed in the summer of 1955 with stops in Paris, Rome, and London, and the film opened in its first-run Todd-AO 70mm engagements in October. Virginia returned to the role of Jean MacLaren for several revivals of Brigadoon, most notably at New York City Center in 1957 and 1963. She also appeared in the live ‚ÄúProducers‚Äô Showcase‚Äù NBC broadcasts of Bloomer Girl and Jack and the Beanstalk in 1956. Bosler appeared in a few short-lived non-musical roles on and off Broadway before effectively retiring from public performance in 1963.  Later  left By the end of the 1970s, Bosler began to study Labanotation, a method to document and preserve choreography in print. Over the next 10 years working for the Dance Notation Bureau in New York City, she created Labanotation scores for works by choreographers such as George Balanchine, Agnes de Mille, Eugene Loring, and Richard Englund, all of which are stored within the archives at the New York Public Library for future study and performance. Bosler began a new career teaching yoga in 1997 at the age of seventy.

The proteins of the SWEET family have been found in plants, animals, protozoans, and bacteria. Eukaryotic family members have 7 transmembrane segments (TMSs) in a 3+1+3 repeat arrangement.  Function  Proteins of the SWEET family appear to catalyze facilitated diffusion (entry or export) of sugars across the plant plasma membrane or the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. They also seem to transport other metabolites, like gibberellins. = Transport Reaction = The generalized reaction catalyzed by known proteins of this family is: :sugars (in) ‚áå sugars (out)  Discovery  SWEETs were originally identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, in a screen for novel facilitators of transmembrane glucose transport. In this experiment, several previously uncharacterized membrane proteins were selected to be screened. These uncharacterized membrane proteins were assayed for glucose transport ability by expression in HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cells, which have negligible glucose transport ability in the normal state. These membrane proteins were co-expressed with a fluorescent FRET (F√∂rster resonance energy transfer) glucose sensor localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Glucose movement from the cytoplasm to the ER of the HEK293T cells was monitored by quantifying changes in FRET ratio. By using this assay, the first member of the SWEET family, AtSWEET1, was identified. Other potential family members were identified by sequence homology. Homologues Chen et al. (2010) reviewed evidence for a new class of sugar transporters, named SWEETs. Those that mediate glucose transport include at least six out of seventeen sugar homologues in Arabidopsis (i.e., TC#s 2.A.123.1.3, 2.A.123.1.5, 2.A.123.1.9, 2.A.123.1.13), two out of over twenty porters in rice (TC#s 2.A.123.1.6 and 2.A.123.1.18), two out of seven homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans (i.e., TC# 2.A.123.1.10) and the single copy human protein (SLC50A1 of Homo sapiens, TC# 2.A.123.1.4). Without Arabidopsis SWEET8 (TC# 2.A.123.1.5), pollen is not viable. The corn homolog ZmSWEET4c was shown to be involved in seed filling. Currently classified members of the SWEET transporter family can be found in the Transporter Classification Database.  SWEETs in plants  Plant SWEETs fall into four subclades. The tomato genome encodes 29 SWEETs. = SWEET9 in Nectar Secretion = Lin et al., 2014, examined the role of SWEET9 in nectaries. SWEET9 is a member of clade 3. A homologue in petunias had been shown to have an inverse correlation between expression and starch content in nectaries. Mutation and overexpression of SWEET9 in Arabidopsis led to corresponding loss of and increase in nectar secretion, respectively. After showing that SWEET9 is involved in nectar secretion, the next step was to determine at which phase of the process SWEET9 has its function. The 3 options were: phloem unloading, or uptake or efflux from nectary parenchyma. A combination of localization studies and starch accumulation assays showed that SWEET9 is involved in sucrose efflux from the nectary parenchyma. = SWEETs 11, 12, and 15 in Embryo Nutrition = Chen et al., 2015, asked what SWEETs are involved in providing nutrition to an embryo. The team noticed that mRNA and protein for SWEETs 11, 12, and 15 are each expressed at high levels during some stage of embryo development. Each gene was subsequently mutated to generate a sweet11;12;15 triple mutant which lacked activity in each of the three genes. This triple mutant was shown to have delayed embryo development; that is, the seeds of the triple mutant were significantly smaller than that of the wild type at the same time during development. The starch content of the seed coat was higher than the wild-type, and the starch content of the embryo was lower than the wild-type. Additionally, protein levels were shown to be maternally controlled: in a sweet11;12;15 mutant crossed with a wild- type plant, the mutant phenotype was only seen when sweet11;12;15 was used as the maternal plant.  Structure  3.1 A resolution structure of a eukaryotic SWEET transporter in a homotrimer (5CTG, OsSWEET2). Each different color represents one subunit. Many bacterial homologues have only 3 TMSs and are half sized, but they nevertheless are members of the SWEET family with a single 3 TMS repeat unit. Other bacterial homologues have 7 TMSs as do most eukaryotic proteins in this family. The SWEET family is large and diverse. Based on 3-D structural analyses, it is likely that these paired 3 TMS SWEET family members function as carriers. Bacterial SemiSWEETs, consist of a triple-helix bundle in a 1-3-2 conformation, with TM3 sandwiched between TM1 and TM2. The structures also show tryptophan and asparagine residues interacting with the sugar; point mutations of these residues to alanine destroys the hexose transport function of SemiSWEET. The SWEET family is a member of the TOG superfamily which is believed to have arisen via the pathway: 2 TMSs > 4 TMSs > 8 TMSs > 7 TMSs > 3 + 3 TMSs.

The party had support from disenchanted Rhodesian settlers including \\"railway men, civil servants, artisans without a job and farmers in economic distress.\\" Its initial program proposed the creation of a central bank to regulate the colony's currency and credit and other measures to provide economic support for white workers and farmers facing competition from low paid African workers and manufacturers facing competition from cheaper South African imports. The party won the 1933 general election, winning 16 out of 30 seats in the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly and formed the government with party leader Godfrey Huggins becoming Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. However, the party failed to implement its promise of establishing a central bank or regulating the monetary system. The Reform Party was believed by many in Rhodesia to be a left-wing party but Huggins presented a cautiously conservative Cabinet after winning power in 1933. In particular, Finance Minister Jacob Smit was a strong believer in conventional economics and opponent of Keynesianism. The course of government led eventually to a confrontration in August 1934 with the left-wing of the party over reform to the Rhodesian railways. Huggins decided to approach Sir Percy Fynn, leader of the Rhodesia Party, who pledged support for a National Government under Huggins. However, the Acting Governor refused a dissolution on the grounds that the Assembly had many years left, and the government had not been defeated. Huggins persuaded the majority of the Executive of the Reform Party to suspend the party's constitution to allow a National Government on 17 September, and then formed the United Party with Fynn, asking a second time for a dissolution on the basis of a changed party alignment. This time the Acting Governor acceded. The November 1934 election resulted in a landslide for Huggins' United Party, which won 24 out of 30 seats, while the Reform Party returned only one seat in the new legislature. Huggins himself switched electoral districts and ran and defeated Reform Party MP Thomas Nangle who had been one of the Reform Party's founders. The Reform Party contested the next election in November 1939, receiving 12% of the popular vote and losing its remaining seat in parliament and disappeared with some of its supporters moving to the Opposition Rhodesia Labour Party.

Film Festival, held annually in the city of Jakarta in Indonesia, was Asia's largest LGBT film festival, in terms of the number of films shown. It was established in 2002, and continued until 2017. In 2003, it overtook the Jakarta International Film Festival and a number of other international ones, in the number of films shown, venues and overall length of Festival, showing 51 films in a range of venues across Jakarta. It was also the first-ever LGBT film festival to be organised in a predominantly Muslim country. On March 4, 2017, Q! Film Festival's official Twitter feed reproduced a message sent the previous day by its founder, John Badalu, stating that the Festival would no longer continue at the present time, that it had \\"been a long fight and struggle to keep it going year after year\\" and that it \\"might come back one day when the time is right\\". Background The Festival lasted for nine days each year, and apart from film screenings, the programme included discussions on film and literature, photo exhibitions and the launch of new books on a variety of topics dealing with gender and sexuality. Events took place across a wide range of venues, such as galleries and cultural missions. Since 2006, it became an official part of the Teddy Award at the Berlin Film Festival in Germany. Entry was free, as the Festival relied entirely on private donations, and received no government financial support or commercial sponsorship. History Q! Film Festival was established in 2002 by 'Q-Munity', an organisation itself set up in 2001 by freelance journalists and people involved in the arts community. They wanted to improve the accessibility of performing arts and film appreciation to the widest public audience possible. It began as a group of ethnic Chinese Indonesians with an interest in contemporary Chinese cinema, whose aim was to stage a festival of Chinese films. The first Director, John Badalu, who is a freelancer in both arts management and journalism, said that, as many of the organisers were from an LGBT background, it was decided instead to screen a wider selection of high quality films from across Asia, and the rest of the world, that drew public attention to the issue of sexuality. The first festival was created entirely from the private collections of the organisers. The first festival, known as 'Q! Film Screenings (QFS)', was held in September 2002 for 5 days, screening over 20 LGBT films. It was attended by more than 1,500 people. The intention from the beginning was to ensure free entry to films and events and to be non- commercial. In the first year, the organisers helped an AIDS organisation to distribute its research report on HIV to members of the audience. Feedback from the audience was an integral part of the Festival: responding to a questionnaire given during the screenings, most of the audience had a positive response to the event. Some even suggested to do these kinds of events on a regular basis. As a result, Q-Munity decided to make the film screening their annual activity, and planned to tour the QFS to other cities in Indonesia. Q-Munity said that a \\"gay-related event in Indonesia\\", with a population that is 80% Muslim, is \\"not an easy task to do\\". As the first-ever LGBT film festival organised in a predominantly Muslim country, Q-Munity members faced death threats from a strong Islamic group. Tensions increased in 2009 and 2010, when members were asked by the Jakarta local government to prove that the Festival conformed to Islamic culture. The Festival organisers were also concerned that the local police had not made sufficient provision for their patrons' safety. However, they praised the police for their handling of the security for the 2013 Festival. The Festival organisers said that the government board of censorship has itself not been supportive towards the nature of the event, whilst commercial sponsors have rejected any connection with \\"gay issues\\", partly on security grounds. It was therefore financed from the start through the savings of Q-Munity members, supplemented by non- commercial private donations and the help of foreign cultural institutions that hired out their venues free of charge. In September 2003, the Festival overtook the Jakarta International Film Festival, London Film Festival and the former Paris Film Festival in terms of number of films, number of screenings, number of venues and longer period of time, featuring 51 films. That year's Festival was attended by 4,000 people, and included many fringe events such as a painting exhibition from Agung Kurniawan, a photo exhibition by six gay and lesbian photographers, a literature talk by a New York novelist, Jamie James, three panel discussions and four international guests, from Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, attending the festival.

Characters =Main characters= ; : : :The crown prince of Pars and the main protagonist. Age 14 (Pars era 320). During his first battle, his kingdom of Pars is conquered by Lusitania as a result of Kharlan's backstabbing. He's very gentle-natured and soft-spoken, unlike his father, and is very kind; he cares about those around him and values their lives over his own. At first oblivious to the dark parts of Pars, after meeting Etoile, Arslan becomes more aware of the evil his country is capable of and desires to learn about Lusitanian beliefs. He also grows smarter and wiser as journey goes, wanting himself to be a king fit for his people to serve and not despair of. Later it is revealed, he is not the real son of Andagoras and Tahamine. ; : : :Arslan's loyal servant. Known as the Knight in black, he is a fearsome warrior. Age 27 (Pars era 320). At the time of Battle of Atropatene, he is the youngest Marzban. He saves Arslan when he was about to be killed in his first battle. He is the one who suggests Pars retreat in their second war with Lusitania, due to the many unfavorable variables the environment presented, but the concerns fell on deaf ears; his concerns were justified as Pars fell to Lusitania in the battle. He is very protective of Arslan and protects him with all of his being; his uncle Vahrez told him to swear, by his sword, his allegiance to prince Arslan. ; : : :The tactician of Arslan's party and an excellent swordsman. The former feudal lord of Daylam and Daryun's friend since their childhood. Age 26 (Pars era 320). He considers himself an artist first and foremost, even though his paintings are terrible. He predicted that Andragoras's disregard for strategy and the situation with the slaves will eventually lead to Pars' ruin. Only joins Arslan's party after the prince says that he would allow him to become the court painter. Until 10, he grew up in the city of Ecbatana and lived as an ordinal citizen as his mother is a free citizen. ; : : :A young boy who serves Narsus. His parents were slaves freed by Narsus, hence his loyalty towards his master. Elam also grows into a friendship with Arslan and becomes a friend to him protecting him when his life is ever in danger. He also seeks to travel outside of Pars toward south to study the legendary cities that hold knowledge of old stories. He has a bad relationship with Alfreed. ; : : :A self-proclaimed traveling musician and womanizer, who is also a skilled bowman and swordsman. Age 22 (Pars era 320).

Location and character  The district of Sonnenh√ºgel is located in the north of the city. To the south it borders on the Innenstadt ‚Äì around the area of the Osnabruck-Altstadt train station ‚Äì and also along the Lange Wand (Long Wall) of the Gartlage district, which stretches along the premises of KM Europa Metal. The district's northwestern border runs along Nette, Bramscher Stra√üe and part of Hansastra√üe. The border with Dodesheide in the east runs through the Landwehrgraben.Map of Osnabr√ºck The district covers an area of 3.19 km¬≤. As of 30 April 2012, it had a population of 8,782 residents. Roughly 58.7% of this total was made up of single-person households (as of late 2009). Sonnenh√ºgel's population is characterised by its high proportion of persons in the 40-65 age bracket; as of the end of 2011 more than 3,000 people in this age group lived here. Roughly 7.1% of the local population is of foreign descent (as of 31 December 2011).Bev√∂lkerung  Friedensstadt Osnabr√ºck Due to its reasonable rent costs and proximity to the city centre, Sonnenh√ºgel is primarily a residential area. The area is largely devoid of significant industry and pedestrian zones. The district enjoys some green zone in the forms of the B√ºrgerpark (citizens‚Äô park) and the Hasefriedhof (Hase Cemetery). Little traffic congestion, as well as various leisure opportunities, makes the district attractive to families. The district had the second-highest proportion of British families (after Dodesheide) until the removal of the British Armed Forces HQ. The departure of the largest garrison outside of the UK freed up additional residential space in the north of the district.Konversion - Abzug der Britischen Streitkr√§fte aus Osnabr√ºck  Abzug der britischen Streitkr√§fte  History  The oldest surviving maps of Osnabr√ºck, dating from 1633, do not show Sonnenh√ºgel as being a part of the city; instead it is situated in front of the city gates (specifically the Hasetor, or Hase Gate). Next to no similarities with the later arrangement of the city's districts are evident. In front of the Hasetor ‚Äì part of the former city wall ‚Äì stands the Gertrudenberg, which since the 12th century had been the location of a monastery. The elevation, a part of today's Sonnenh√ºgel district, was of strategic significance ‚Äì not only did it allow clear views over the city, this area north of the city was particularly well-suited for military operations.Der Schwedenplan von 1633  Friedensstadt Osnabr√ºck At the start of the 19th century, most of the territory which makes up today's district belonged to the ‚ÄúHasser Laischaft‚Äù. The Laischaften (people's groupings) were self-administering bodies; some still exist today, such as the Herrenteichslaischaft and Heger Laischaft. Reminders of the Laischaften can be found at various points across the city ‚Äì such as the Haselaischaftsweg in Sonnenh√ºgel.Grundriss von der Stadt Osnabr√ºck und ihrem Bezirke  Friedensstadt Osnabr√ºck The expansion of the city also saw plenty of development in the Sonnenh√ºgel area. Of particular note is the construction of the ‚ÄúIrrenanstalt‚Äù (today a pejorative term similar to ‚Äúlunatic asylum‚Äù) on the Gertrudenburg in 1868, and that of a similar institution on Knollstra√üe in 1864.Merkels Karte von Osnabr√ºck aus dem Jahr 1868  Friedensstadt Osnabr√ºck Little public attention is given to the caverns located underneath the Gertrudenberg. The 900-metre long branched tunnel network is the subject of various myths. The caverns came into being during the 14th century with the establishment of a quarry on the Getrudenberg. During World War II the underground complex was used as an air-raid shelter by several thousand people.  Leisure  Sonnenh√ºgel offers a number of recreational opportunities. The north of the district is home to the Nettebad; following renovation work in 2005 it has been able to market itself as a key hotspot for activity, swimming and wellness, and is also renowned throughout the wider region. Alongside several slides and recreational pools, the Nettebad also has competitive swimming lanes both inside and outside the main building, as well as sauna facilities connected to the main swimming area.Nettebad - Badespa√ü in Osnabr√ºck - Historie Directly opposite the Nettebad ‚Äì on Verther Landstra√üe ‚Äì is the Eissportcenter Osnabr√ºck (Osnabr√ºck Ice Rink). However, the ice rink itself is only accessible during the winter months; it is converted into a standard roller-skating rink in time for summer. A BMX course is also situated behind the ice-skating hall.  Transportation  Bus lines 32/33 (towards Nettebad) and 31/51/52/53 (towards Dodesheide) have stops in the Sonnenh√ºgel area, on S√ºntelstra√üe, Lerchenstra√üe and Knollstra√üe respectively. There is a stop on Bramscher Stra√üe on lines 81/82 (towards Pye) and 41 (towards Haste).Liniennetz - Stadtwerke Osnabr√ºck Together with the Vehrter Landstra√üe, these roads make up the busiest artery in the district. Noise levels here can sometimes reach up to 75 dB.Stadt Osnabr√ºck Sonnenh√ºgel formerly had a connection to the tram network on line 2, which ran from Haste via Bramscher Stra√üe, Hasetor, Nikolaiort and Neumarkt towards Sch√∂lerberg.  Churches  The Heilig Geist (Holy Spirit) church (Roman Catholic) The Matth√§uskirche (St. Matthew's Church, Protestant) Sonnenh√ºgel is home to several churches ‚Äì along with their respective parishes, the Roman Catholic Heilig Geist church is located on Lerchenstra√üe and the Protestant Matth√§uskirche on Moorlandstra√üe. Also located on Moorlandstra√üe is the former Reformed Protestant Erl√∂serkirche (Church of the Redeemer); the building was taken over by the Greek Orthodox Church in May 2010.Ev.-ref. Gemeinde Osnabr√ºck: Griechisch-orthodoxe Gemeinde √ºbernimmt ehem. Erl√∂serkirche Between the B√ºrgerpark and Knollstra√üe lies the Gertrudenberg monastery, on the hill which shares its name. The Getrudenkirche also remains standing along the former abbesses‚Äô building. This church currently functions as a Simultaneum (shared church). Today a private psychiatric clinic is located on the grounds of the former monastery.  Schools  Being a residential area, the Sonnenh√ºgel district is also home to several schools, which often interact with one another. The municipal Albert- Schweitzer-Schule has been situated on Lerchenstra√üe since 1956. Around 150 pupils are taught at the primary school, which shares buildings and a playground with the Heilig-Geist-Schule. Founded in 1960, this school (also a primary) is primarily oriented towards pupils from Catholic families. Every year the children take part in the traditional Steckenpferdreiten parade.Albert-Schweitzer-Schule Unsere Schule - Heilig-Geist Grundschule Osnabr√ºck The Schulzentrum Sonnenh√ºgel (Sonnenh√ºgel School Complex, formerly the Schulzentrum Sebastopol) is located only a few hundred metres away. This is where the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Gymnasium, Wittekind-Realschule and Felix- Nussbaum-Schule are located; together appearing to constitute one secondary school. Nearby is the Anne-Frank-Schule, a special school for pupils with physical and motor disabilities, along with the Mensa (canteen), school complex gymnasium and the district sports centre, which is also used by SSC Dodesheide. The Sophie-Scholl-Orientierungsstufe (orientation-level school) existed until 2004. The first school building on Knollstra√üe was built in 1975, at first occupied by the Orientierungsstufe Sebastopol. By 1982 all the schools situated here today had moved into the building complex. The Ernst- Moritz-Arndt-Gymnasium had previously been located on Lotterstra√üe; among its famous alumni is the former German state president Christian Wulff. The school complex had to undergo major renovation work following a serious fire in February 2001.Schulzentrum Sonnenh√ºgel  Sport  In spite of its name, the sports club SSC Dodesheide is in fact based on Reinhold-Tiling-Weg in the Sonnenh√ºgel district. Founded in 1962, the club offers a wide range of sport- related activities and is one of the largest in the city with a total of 2,800 members. In the immediate area there are numerous tennis, football and athletics grounds as well as the gymnasium of the Schulzentrum Sonnenh√ºgel.SSC Dodesheide Closer to the city centre, the Osnabr√ºcker Tennis-Club e.V. has been based on Suntelstra√üe since 1908. The club's facilities include an indoor tennis centre, a clubhouse and several playing courts.OTC - Osnabr√ºcker Tennis-Club  Other  The district's name is linked to the slight elevation encountered around the area of H√ºgelstra√üe in the north. The 97-metre-high Gertrudenberg, located towards the south side of the district, has nothing to do with the nomenclature. An independent public newspaper ‚Äì the Haste- Dodesheide-Sonnenh√ºgel-T√∂ne ‚Äì is published at irregular intervals in the city's three adjoined northern districts.

He holds a professorship at Leiden University, where he served as director of Leiden Observatory from 1996 to 2003. Biography After studying at Gonzaga College, Miley obtained his BSc in physics at University College Dublin in the years 1959‚Äì1963, going on to complete a PhD in radio astronomy at the University of Manchester in 1968. He then became a research associate and assistant scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory until 1970, when he moved to Leiden Observatory as a senior scientist. Miley has filled various positions in Leiden until the present day: He became astronomy professor at Leiden University in 1988, served as the observatory's scientific director 1996‚Äì2003, was appointed to a Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences Professorship 2003‚Äì2008 and continues to serve as a professor of astronomy. While Miley remained anchored in Leiden, he accepted several visiting posts: He was as visiting professor at Lick Observatory 1977‚Äì1978, and a visiting scientist for the infrared astronomy satellite IRAS at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 1981‚Äì1982. From 1984 to 1988, he was senior astronomer and head of academic affairs at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, as well as an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University. Miley served as vice-president of the International Astronomical Union from 2006 to 2012, where his focus was on astronomy and development. Research In Manchester, Miley was active at Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories in radio astronomy, where he was involved in developing long-baseline interferometry, a high-resolution technique that Miley used to study the properties of quasars. Miley continued this research during his stay at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, establishing a relation between the size and distance of quasars. Upon his transfer to Leiden, Miley began to work at the newly-completed Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). In collaboration with the research group of Harry van der Laan, Miley used the WSRT to study distant radio galaxies, discovered head-tail radio galaxies in clusters and also pinpointed the position of the x-ray source Cygnus X-1, a black hole within our own galaxy. Miley's sabbatical at Lick Observatory marked his transition from a radio astronomer to a multi-wavelength astronomer, aided by the development of digital astronomical cameras in the 1970s. While researching the \\"reddest\\" radio galaxies in the radio and optical regimes, he was involved in the discovery of some of the most distant galaxies known at the time. He expanded his wavelength range further by joining the science team responsible for the infrared satellite IRAS, working on the mission's pioneering deep infrared surveys. After his return to Leiden, Miley combined his knowledge of techniques optical and infrared astronomy to study further both radio galaxies and the gas that surrounds such galaxies, discovering some of the first cosmic evolution effects known for this class of galaxies. While Miley's move to the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore was motivated by a desire to observe with the Hubble Space Telescope, the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster delayed the space telescope's launch, he stayed on as the institute Head of Academic Affairs, continuing his research on high-redshift radio galaxies. After his return to Leiden as a professor in 1988, Miley and his colleagues demonstrated that bright radio galaxies could be used as beacons to locate the first galaxy clusters in the universe, allowing astronomers to examine previously unexplored structures in the early universe. In 1997, Miley wrote a proposal for a new kind of low-frequency radio telescope, which would allow for an exploration of even earlier eras of the universe. Construction for this telescope, which Miley had dubbed LOFAR, for Low Frequency Array, began in 2006, led by the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy ASTRON. When the antenna was completed in 2017, it consisted of a phased array of 20,000 single antennae in 48 stations, located in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Poland, Great Britain, and Ireland. Education and development Miley is an active academic teacher, having supervised more than 25 PhD theses since 1978. In 2004, he began to set up an astronomy education program aimed at inspiring young children in 2004, which eventually grew into the Universe Awareness educational program, a Cornerstone project of the UN-ratified IAU/UNESCO International Year of Astronomy in 2009 (IYA2009). In 1973 Miley went on a lecture tour of China as the first astronomer to visit China after the cultural revolution. During his term as vice-president of the International Astronomical Union, Miley designed the IAU strategic plan \\"Astronomy for Development,\\" whose aim is to \\"contribute globally to education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels and can enable less developed, poorer countries to participate in cutting-edge scientific research.\\" The strategic plan was adopted at the IAU General Assembly in Rio de Janeiro in August 2009. As part of the plan's implementation, the IAU established an Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) at the South African Astronomical Observatory in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2011. For the creation and establishment of OAD, its director Kevin Govender and the IAU were jointly awarded the Edinburgh Medal in 2016.

It was built from 1826 to 1828, with extensions being built in 1901 and 1928. It was designed by Joseph Ireland and the architect for the extension in 1901 was Edward Goldie. It is built as part of Giffard House, which is now a presbytery for the church. It is situated on Paternoster Row, between Wolverhampton City Council and the Ring Road St Peters. Both the church and Giffard House are a Grade II* listed building. Giffard House, Wolverhampton from British Listed Buildings, retrieved 1 February 2016 History of the building Giffard House =Giffard House and Catholic Wolverhampton= The Giffard family, who were a Catholic Recusant family, used their house as a home for spinsters or widowed sisters and daughters, who cared for priests and monks and travelling Catholics. During the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot two Catholics were executed in High Green, Wolverhampton (now known as Queen Square). The church does have a Recusant Chalice from the English Civil War which is still used at Mass.Tony Burdon, The Roman Catholic Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul from Scribd, (2013) 3-4. In 1678, during the reign of Charles II, there was the Titus Oates persecution and two Jesuit Priests were arrested in Wolverhampton, Father Gavin was executed in London and Father Atkins died in Stafford Prison. Peter Giffard was also arrested but survived and a local priest, William Ironmonger was also executed. There were more riots when the last Catholic King James II fled the country in 1688 and William of Orange and his wife Mary became the rulers. The Chapel in Giffard House was attacked and the priest's vestments burnt. In the 17th century, there were a number of Roman Catholics in Wolverhampton. The town was known as \\"Little Rome\\", which was meant as an insult. Local gentry who remained Catholic were, the Giffards, the Levesons (pronounced \\"Looson\\") and the Whitgreaves. The Giffards of Chillington Hall were involved with St Peter and St Paul's Church. The Giffards owned two town houses in Wolverhampton, one was in Cock Street (now called Victoria Street) and one in Tup Street (sometimes Goat Street) and now North Street, and this is now the Presbytery to the attached church. In the early 18th century, a new house was built on the site of the old one in North Street. The current house was built from 1727 to 1729 and it was designed by Francis Smith of Warwick. From 1804 to 1826, it was the home of the Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District, Bishop John Milner. The house became his place of burial and he bequeathed money for the building of the church. =Church building= St Peter's and St Paul's Church is the oldest Roman Catholic church building in England, that is, it was created during, and just after the English Reformation. The chapel of the Giffard town house, which was originally just for the Giffard family and their servants, opened to other Catholic worshippers. The church of St Peter and St Paul as it is now on its current site was built in many stages.  Giffard House chapel extension (1743‚Äì1765)  There was first the chapel, built as a room in the rear of the house. This chapel was then extended in 1743 and decorated in 1765. Bishop Milner lived in Giffard House from 1804 to his death in 1826. His brass memorial designed by Pugin is in the Nave and the Bishop's grave is currently in the crypt, he was originally buried in the orchard where the Ring Road now lies.  Joseph Ireland's extension (1826‚Äì1828)  In 1826 the Chapel was again extended to the design of Joseph Ireland in the Greek Revival style. In 1828, the nave of St Peter and Paul's was completed and the church was opened. The inauguration Mass was attended by approximately 60 priests.. The side Chapels dedicated to Our Lady and the Sacred Heart were not yet built and as it was hidden by the surrounding buildings and only approached by an archway from the road outside. It was reasonably impregnable as far as burglars were concerned, because in James Quirke's M.A. Thesis, he quotes a letter written in defence of one Ann Williams in 1831 at the London Criminal Court. She was facing charges of attempted robbery at the church. James Peck wrote the following letter in her defence: > \\"As for Ennybody thinking to crack into that place, the might as well think > of cracking into Newgate as there is no windows hall around this chapel. It > consists of skuy lites and there is but one door, they have got to pass > through two more doors which is very strong bard on the inside. It is a > thing impossable to think about getting into that place without being found > out\\". The outcome of the trial is currently unknown.  Side chapels  There are two side chapels that were built as extensions from the Nave. = Sacred Heart Chapel = The Sacred Heart Chapel, (or South Chapel) was designed by Edward Goldie in 1901, he also designed the Sacristy wing. = Lady Chapel = In 1928 the Lady Chapel (or North Chapel) was built and designed by Sandy and Norris.  Threat of demolition (1962‚Äì1982)  = The redevelopment of Wolverhampton (1962) = The church, and the school that was there at the time, remained as a centre until 1962 when Father Kavanagh discovered that Wolverhampton City Council wished to demolish it because both the Local Government and National Government wished to redevelop the city. Councillor F. Clapham, the Chair of the Planning Committee, wanted a new Civic Centre built on the site of the church, (he did intend to build a new school and church, in Whitmore Reans). Father Kavanagh organised a committee composed of both Catholics and non-Catholics and Councillor Fletcher, Councillor Stokes and Miss Reidy were members. The Planning Application eventually was defeated. = Ring Road troubles (1967‚Äì1982) = In 1967 the Ring Road was being built and was planned to run through where the church stood. Everything nearby that could be demolished was demolished. The parish was assured that the graveyard was safe but 42 bodies were disinterred and moved to Jeffcock Road so that a new retaining wall could be built. It was then discovered that the church roof had dry rot and scaffolding was erected. Father Molloy was now the Priest and he was forced to say Mass in the school hall. In July 1967, the Wolverhampton Express and Star reported that the house was not affected by the dry rot. The Archdiocese applied for a demolition order as they thought that the cost of repair was too high and they also conjectured that no one would come as: \\"the Church is cut off by the Ring Road and the Parishioner's homes were quite far from the town centre\\". A new church was to be built, possibly in Gatis Street, Whitmore Reans. The money would come from selling the land where the church and the House stood and an office block was to be built on the site. This time Wolverhampton Council and a new Church Committee worked together and the proposal for demolition was rejected in 1982 by the Secretary of State for the Environment (Michael Heseltine M.P.). Grants were obtained from the Council and from English Heritage. The Appeal Secretary was Birmingham University Librarian Anthony Nicholls (who was a parishioner at St Mary and St John). Peter Giffard of Chillington was as involved as his ancestors had been. Father Joyce was the priest with Maurice Couve de Murville as the Archbishop of Birmingham.  Refurbishment (2006)  By 2006, a complete refurbishment of the Church was needed. The church received a large amount of money from the will of the Armstrong brothers. Father Patrick Daly organised a Finance Committee under the guidance of Brian Middleton (and then Mrs Betty Green when Brian became ill); work then commenced. Bill Finnegan helped to co-ordinate the craftsmen. The architect was Stephen Oliver and the project was co- ordinated by Father Patrick Daly.  Parish  The church currently has one Sunday Mass at 10:15 am on Sunday morning.St Peter and St Paul, Wolverhampton from Archdiocese of Birmingham, retrieved 12/02/17 As well as being a presbytery, Giffard House is also the home of the University of Wolverhampton's Catholic Chaplaincy.

It is located from Kitale town along the Kiminini ‚Äì Turbo road. The name 'Mabati Tatu' is a direct translation of Swahili for three iron sheets. This name is in reference to the family of Mzee Patrick Wamalwa Ngome who was the first to settle at the then bushy dirt road intersection. In 1992, Mzee Patrick Ngome relocated his family from the neighboring Uasin Gishu District (now Uasin Gishu County) following a spate of tribal clashes between the Kalenjin and Luhya communities living in the district. Having been a politically active man, he was constantly targeted and threatened. Mzee Ngome bought a 13 acre piece of Land from the Irene Melly. He constructed three big houses for his three wives. These houses were covered in iron sheets. in a sparsely populated are dotted with grass thatched huts, the three stood out from Kilometers away. From nearby slopes, shiny new iron roofs became location markers and people started giving direction based on the three iron sheets. Mzee Ngome himself was a people's person, when finally his family of more than 20 people settled in, he held court at his homestead and entertained guests of all manner. The family and the endless people traffic attracted snack vendors including members of the Ngome family. In 1997, Patrick Ngome, vied and won the Ndalu Ward Councillor's seat in Bungoma county council. His elevated status created even more fame for the now growing center. During his tenure, Mzee Ngome oversaw some road renovations that would make the center more accessible and passionately fought for land title deeds for people who had moved into the area for permanent settlement. Mabati Tatu is now a vibrant small town serving a population of about 10,000 people from the surrounding villages. The original three houses have been swallowed by shops and kiosks and more homes. Patrick Ngome died in November 2011 when already so many changes had taken place to Mabati Tatu to make it a small town. His Family still owns a substantial size of land connected to the town. However none of the children has developed interest to do business around there. They are all working and settled in big cities around Kenya.

The year is 1872 and Jackson, a former member of Union General Sherman's army, embarks on an odyssey of both rescue and revenge. At nearly every turn he encounters a mysterious figure named Ezra who delights in tormenting him, while gleefully murdering any witnesses to their encounters.

She is currently the Benton Family Associate Professor of Christian Education at Columbia Theological Seminary. Career Dawson a B.A. from California State University, Long Beach (1981), a M.A. in Christian Education and became a certified Christian Educator at Presbyterian School of Christian Education (1992), a M.Div from Columbia Theological Seminary (1994) and a Ph.D. from Princeton Theological Seminary (2002). She began her career as a teacher in Los Alamitos and Palm Springs Unified School Districts (1981-1990) where she was voted Teacher of the Year in 1990. She was ordained in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in 1994 and began working in the church. Dawson served as the Interim Director of Christian Education at Shallowford Presbyterian Church (1992-1994) and Associate Pastor for Christian Education and Youth Coordination at Spring Hills Presbyterian Church (1994-1997). Since then she has been invited and taught faith curriculum and development at many churches across the country. Her work includes serving as the Editor/Consultant on \\"We Believe\\" Children‚Äôs Curriculum in its initial stages for the Presbyterian Church (USA). She also serves on the Educator Certification Committee of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Dawson began teaching while a doctoral student at Princeton Theological Seminary (1998-2001) where she was a teaching fellow and guest lecturer. She served at Union Presbyterian Seminary as the Assistant Professor of Christian Education for Children and Youth (2001-2004) and is currently at Columbia Theological Seminary where she is now the Benton Family Associate Professor of Christian Education. She also plays an integral role in developing the doctorate of educational ministry degree at Columbia, which is the only mainline Protestant institution to offer this program. Thought Dawson work has largely focused on children and youth education, but has emphasized the importance of inter- generational relationships as well. She advocates for the understanding of development over the course of a lifetime in order to develop specific educational resources. Within this focus she has done research on both the creation of resources and the methods of teaching. This is apparent throughout her publications in various articles and books. One area of importance for Dawson is the availability of resources for all Christian educators. She believes there is a lack of accessibility and opportunity for many to use these educational materials. In an effort to support her cause she created and moderates the resource sharing website, Hope4CE. In this project she hopes to allow Christian educators from all over the world to have access to a variety of different materials.

She was bred in New York by Eklektikos Stable and was owned by Sheila Rosenblum's Lady Sheila Stable. A winner of 16 races from 25 starts, she won the Eclipse Award as American Champion Female Sprint Horse for her accomplishments in 2015. La Verdad was trained by Linda Rice and primarily ridden by jockey Jos√© Ortiz. Background The phrase \\"la verdad\\" means \\"the truth\\" in Spanish. La Verdad's sire is Yes It's True, a multiple graded stakes winner who placed in 15 stakes races during his career, including victories in the Grade 1 De Francis Dash, Grade 2 Riva Ridge and six Grade 3 events. Her mother, Noble Fire, was sired by Hook and Ladder, a two-time graded stakes winner in Florida. Racing career =2013: three-year-old season= La Verdad began her racing career at the age of three against New York-breds. She broke her maiden in her second lifetime start at Aqueduct on April 7, winning a six furlong sprint by 6 3/4 lengths under the colors of her breeder Eklektikos. After winning her next start in restricted allowance company at Belmont Park on May 8, she was laid up until November, winning another restricted allowance at Aqueduct by 8 3/4 lengths. La Verdad was then purchased privately by Sheila Rosenblum at the suggestion of the horse's trainer, Linda Rice. \\"There was a little bit of a delicate situation with the owner and I was asked to come in and kind of save the day\\", Rosenblum said, adding that she decided to go out on a limb and \\"go for it\\" with regards to the purchase. La Verdad's final start of the year, on December 19 at Aqueduct, was her first race against open company. After yielding the lead midway through the six furlong race, she came back at the top of the stretch and drew clear to win by two lengths. =2014: four-year-old season= After winning her 2014 debut against a short field at Aqueduct on January 17, La Verdad was entered to compete in her first graded stakes race ‚Äì the Barbara Fritchie at Laurel Park ‚Äì which would also be her first race at seven furlongs. Going off as the second choice, La Verdad established the lead early, but could not hold off the stalking My Wandy's Girl, losing by a length. One month later, on March 29, La Verdad won her first stakes race, the Broadway at Aqueduct, against New York-breds. The Broadway was the first of four straight wins for La Verdad, which included her first graded stakes victory in the Distaff at Aqueduct on April 19, and the Critical Eye and Dancin Renee Stakes at Belmont Park against New York-breds. La Verdad then shipped north to Saratoga where she was unsuccessful in two graded stakes starts, finishing fifth in both the six-furlong Honorable Miss and the seven-furlong Ballerina. After losing narrowly to Artemis Agrotera in the Grade 2 Gallant Bloom at Belmont, La Verdad returned to the winner's circle on October 18, winning the Iroquois Stakes against state-breds on New York Showcase Day. Her 2014 campaign ended with a loss in the Fall Highweight at Aqueduct ‚Äì her first race against male horses. =2015: five-year-old season= La Verdad's championship season was highlighted with victories in six straight stakes races on the New York sprint circuit, starting with her second win in the Distaff on April 18 at Aqueduct. She followed that with a win in the Grade 3 Vagrancy at Belmont on May 16, and a repeat victory in the Dancin Renee against state-breds at Belmont on June 28. La Verdad then returned to Saratoga for her second Honorable Miss stakes. Sent off as the second choice behind Judy the Beauty, La Verdad led at every pole, winning by 4 lengths. Her victory, however, would be rescinded by the New York State Gaming Commission due to a medication violation.https://rulings.gaming.ny.gov/searchrulings.detail.php?ID=36480 New York State Gaming Commission Ruling AQ 26-2015 Following the Honorable Miss, La Verdad won the Grade 2 Gallant Bloom at Belmont in late September, fighting off a late challenge by the Chad Brown-trained Wavell Avenue. With a possible start in the Grade 1 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint at Keeneland on the radar, Linda Rice decided to send La Verdad to her third title defense of the year: the Iroquois against state-breds at Belmont, which would be run just one week before the Breeders' Cup race. La Verdad easily defended her Iroquois title, coming from off the pace to win. After the Iroquois, the decision was made to pay the $100,000 supplement to the Breeders' Cup. The fourth betting choice in the seven-furlong Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint, La Verdad returned to her on-the-lead running style. Despite the one-week layoff, she fought off several challenges. Her valiant efforts would be thwarted by Gallant Bloom foe Wavell Avenue, who surged and passed La Verdad in the late stages to win by 1 3/4 lengths. Sheila Rosenblum said afterward that she was \\"thrilled to take second\\", saying that La Verdad \\"ran some hell of a race.\\" La Verdad had been considered for the Fasig-Tipton auctions in November, but was withdrawn in order to continue racing. She concluded her 2015 season competing in her second Fall Heighweight at Aqueduct, finishing sixth. La Verdad edged Wavell Avenue by eight first-place votes, 98‚Äì90, to win the Eclipse Award as American Champion Female Sprint Horse. At the New York Thoroughbred Breeders Awards held in April 2016, she was named Champion Female Sprinter and Older Dirt Female. Retirement On January 9, 2016 ‚Äì three days after she was announced as an Eclipse Award finalist ‚Äì La Verdad ran in what would end up being her final career start, winning the listed Interborough at Aqueduct in wire-to-wire fashion. La Verdad had been considered for the Barbara Fritchie at Laurel in February, but on January 31 Sheila Rosenblum and Linda Rice decided to retire the horse. Rice said that she and Rosenblum wanted La Verdad to go out on top following her Eclipse Award and Interborough victories. Following her retirement, La Verdad foaled a filly by Travers winner Medaglia D'Oro (2017), a filly by leading sire Tapit (2018) and a filly by two-time Horse of the Year Curlin (2019). Shortly before her passing in May 2020, she foaled a colt by Grade 1 winner Into Mischief. =Death= La Verdad was humanely euthanized on May 10, 2020 due to colic complications.

He authored more than 40 plays and film scripts, including the patriotic drama City of Phoenix, one of the most influential plays during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and Return on a Snowy Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. He directed The Soul of the Nation, Hong Kong's first colour film, based on his own historical drama Song of Righteousness. He was also well known as an outspoken critic of China's cultural policies, both of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist governments, and was repeatedly persecuted as a result. He fled to Hong Kong in 1945 to avoid being captured by KMT agents, and returned to Beijing after the foundation of the People's Republic China in 1949. He was denounced as a \\"rightist\\" during the Anti-Rightist Campaign and performed hard labour in the \\"Great Northern Wilderness\\" for three years, and was again persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. His wife, the celebrated pingju actress Xin Fengxia, refused to divorce him and became disabled after undergoing beatings and penal labour. Despite these ordeals, Wu continued to criticize government censorship and to call for political freedom, and was widely admired for his moral conviction. Early life Wu was born on 21 April 1917 to a prominent scholar-official family in Beijing, with ancestral roots in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. His grandfather Wu Zhiying (Âê¥Á®öËã±) was a muliao of the Qing dynasty reformer Zhang Zhidong and participated in the Xinhai Revolution. His father Wu Ying () was a founder and curator of the Beijing Palace Museum. His mother Zhou Qinqi () gave birth to 15 children, 11 of whom (four sons and seven daughters) survived to adulthood. She gave birth to Wu Zuguang, her first child, in the mansion of Wu Ying's uncle Zhuang Yunkuan, a minister of the Republic of China government. In 1935, Wu entered Sino-French University in Beijing. The next year, a relative who was running a drama school in Nanjing persuaded him to move there and teach at his school. There he met several people who would become prominent dramatists, including Cao Yu and Chen Zhice. Wartime career At the outset of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Wu wrote the patriotic war play City of Phoenix (), which made him well-known in China at age 20. It was one of the most performed dramas during the eight-year war. He later wrote several critically acclaimed plays, including Return on a Snowy Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. His works are strongly influenced by the May Fourth New Culture Movement. As eastern China fell to the Japanese, he moved to the wartime capital Chongqing, where he worked as an editor for the Xinmin Wanbao newspaper. In 1945, he published Mao Zedong's now famous poem \\"Snow: to the Tune of Garden in Full Spring\\", which infuriated the Kuomintang government. He escaped to British Hong Kong to avoid being captured by KMT agents, and made a living writing screenplays and making films. He directed The Soul of the Nation (), Hong Kong's first colour film, based on his historical drama, Song of Righteousness, about the Song dynasty patriot Wen Tianxiang. He also made Return on a Snowy Night into a film, as well as two others. In 1946, Wu married the actress L√º En () in Shanghai. Early People's Republic Wu Zuguang and wife Xin Fengxia After the Communist Party of China won the Civil War and established the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wu returned to Beijing. Like many intellectuals at the time, he held high hopes for the new People's Republic which finally restored peace in a united China after decades of war and division. He wanted to return to writing plays, but was assigned by the government to direct Song of the Red Flag, a film about women textile workers. As he had no experience with factory life, it took him a year to finish the film, which he considered a \\"worthless failure.\\" He and L√º En divorced amicably in 1950, due to differences in personality and interests. In 1951, his friend Lao She introduced him to the famous pingju opera performer Xin Fengxia, who had acted in one of Wu's plays and admired his talent. They married that year, despite the fact that they were from differing socioeconomic backgrounds; she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy. During this period he made the Peking opera film Goddess of the Luo River () and Mei Lanfang and His Stage Art, a documentary about Mei Lanfang. He also wrote the Peking operas Three Beatings of Tao Sanchun () and San Guan Yan (). Persecution Wu (center), his wife Xin Fengxia, and their three children During Mao Zedong's Anti-Rightist Campaign, Wu was denounced as a \\"rightist\\" in 1957 and sent to the Great Northern Wilderness in Heilongjiang to be \\"reformed through labour.\\" His crime was to criticize the Communist Party's control of the theatre and to argue that the neihang (experts) should have a greater role in such matters. He was called an enemy of the Party, even by his renowned colleague Tian Han. Tian later referenced Wu's work approvingly, which is seen by some as an implicit apology, and was himself persecuted to death. Xin Fengxia was pressured to divorce him, but refused. Citing a legendary love story from one of her operas, she said \\"Wang Baochuan waited 18 years for Xue Pinggui, and I will wait 28 years for Wu Zuguang.\\" As a result, she was herself labeled a rightist and went through struggle sessions. Wu returned to Beijing after three years of hard labour, but six years later, China fell into the even greater turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. Xin Fengxia and Wu Zuguang were both denounced at the beginning of the period. She became disabled below her left knee after a severe beating. Their friend Lao She drowned himself after being similarly tortured. During the tumultuous decade Wu and Xin both served years of forced labour. In December 1975, she became paralyzed after suffering a stroke, and Wu took care of her for the rest of her life. Post-Cultural Revolution After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Wu was politically rehabilitated in 1980 and inducted into the Communist Party, an event he described as \\"neither an occasion for laughter or tears\\", and his publication ban was lifted after two decades. His play Itinerant Players (), based on Xin Fengxia's experiences, was performed that year. In 1983, Wu traveled to the University of Iowa in the U.S. to attend the International Writing Program. Wu was in general loyal to Deng Xiaoping's government, but continued to be an outspoken critic. In 1983, he dismissed Deng's Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign as futile. In September 1986, he read an essay at a meeting of the China Writers Association entitled \\"Against Those Who Wield the Scissors‚Äîa Plea for an End to Censorship\\". It was enthusiastically received by the audience, but only a censored version was published, minus 1,000 characters deemed \\"acrimonious\\". After the December 1986 student demonstrations, he was pressured to leave the Communist Party in 1987. Retired Politburo member Hu Qiaomu came to his home in person to demand his resignation from the Party. He obliged, as he did not think he was \\"the sort of person who should be in the Party.\\" In spring 1989, Wu signed a petition calling for greater political freedom. Following the army crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Wu called for a reassessment of the incident, but was forbidden to speak at a CPPCC meeting. Xin Fengxia died on 12 April 1998, during a trip to Changzhou, Wu's ancestral hometown. He was devastated by the loss and his health quickly deteriorated. He suffered three strokes in the next few years, and died on 9 April 2003. Children Wu Zuguang and Xin Fengxia had three children. Their son Wu Huan is also a writer, painter, and calligrapher. After the deaths of Wu Zuguang, he organized the exhibition \\"A Hundred Years of the Wu Family\\" at the Poly Art Museum in Beijing. It was also held in France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

It is fed mainly with water from Utterslev Mose to the west and Gentofte Lake to the north and drains into St. J√∏rgen's Lake in central Copenhagen through a system of pipes. The small Emdrup Lake Park is situated at the southwestern corner of the lake. The lake and park were protected by the Conservation Authority in 1963. History The lake was created artificially when a dam was built on Emdrup Stream (Emdrup B√¶k) to improve the supply of water to Copenhagen. The water was instead led through Lygte√•en to the Ladeg√•rd Canal and into St. J√∏rgensen's Lake. Frederik II provided for the construction of a six km water tube from Lake Emdrup to the Gammeltorv marketplace. In 1608, Christian IV installed the Caritas Well on the square. The altitude difference being 9 metres, the water pressure was adequate for a fountain to be constructed. Though ornamental in character, the well was also part of the city's water supply system. Lake Emdrup was long known as Lundehuss√∏en after the Lundehus Kro, an inn located on Lyngbyvej. The Caritas Well which was installed on Gammeltorv in 1608, was fed with water from Lake Emdrup. The site S√∏holm viewed from across the lake It is situated in the triangular area between Tuborgvej to the west, Lyngbyvej to the east and Emdrupvej to the south. It is surrounded mostly by single-family detached homes. A listed Neoclassical house from the 1800s, S√∏holm, stands on the north shore of the lake. Ecology The lake has a rich birdlife. Black- headed gulls occasionally breed in the trees on the island. Other common birds at the lake are greylag goose and tufted duck. Use The lake is the site of an annual St. Hans' Eve celebration. On cold winters, it is used for skating. Bathing and fishing is prohibited.

Close PnuC homologues are found in a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram- positive bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.  Function  PnuC of Salmonella typhimurium and Haemophilus influenzae are believed to function cooperatively with NadR homologues, multifunctional proteins that together with PnuC, participate in NR phosphorylation, transport and transcriptional regulation. NadR, a cytoplasmic protein that is partly membrane associated, contains one well conserved and one poorly conserved mononucleotide-binding consensus sequence (G-X4 GKS). It drives transport and may render transport responsive to internal pyridine nucleotide levels. While its N-terminal half functions as a repressor, its C-terminal half functions as an NR kinase in a putative group translocation process. =PnuC of Haemophilus influenzae= The H. influenzae homologue has been shown to transport NR from the periplasm into the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of NR by NadR is required for NR uptake. The ribonucleoside kinase (RNK) domain has both Walker A and Walker B motifs, responsible for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. In addition, a proposed LID domain was identified in RNK. LID domains have been found in other kinases, and these domains are regions which are able to move after substrate binding. They are responsible for coordination of three distinct conformations, an open state in the absence of substrate, a partially closed state after substrate binding, and a fully closed state when both substrates are present. In H. influenzae, NR enters the NAD+ resynthesis pathway after phosphorylation to NMN, and subsequently, NAD+ is synthesized from NMN and ATP via an NMN adenylyl transferase activity. NadR represents a multifunctional regulator/enzyme complex able to integrate several functions, such as enzymatic catalysis, transport, and transcriptional regulatory activities. Other constituents required for uptake The components of the H. influenzae pathway necessary for NAD+, NMN, and NR uptake have been determined. Merdanovic et al. characterized two enzymes, an outer membrane nucleotide phosphatase, and an NAD+ nucleotidase (NadN) located in the periplasm. They showed that NAD+ and NMN cross the outer membrane mainly via the OmpP2 porin. Only NR can be utilized by the PnuC transport system located in the inner membrane. The pnuC gene product is the protein that is responsible for the main flow of the NR substrate into the cytoplasm. The study of Merdanovic et al. suggests that the RNK activity of NadR determines NR transport and is negatively regulated by cytoplasmic NAD+ feedback inhibition. Therefore, NR uptake is under NadR feedback control. ATP, not the proton motive force, appears to be required for NR uptake. Thus, the driving force for NR uptake via PnuC is NR phosphorylation by NadR. A concerted group translocation mechanism can be considered whereby NadR facilitates the dissociation of NR from PnuC by phosphorylating it to NMN, thus preventing efflux of NR. =Transport reaction= The proposed transport reaction catalyzed by PnuC and NadR is: NR (out) + ATP (in) ‚Üí NMN (in) + ADP (in).  Structure  PnuC of Salmonella typhimurium and Haemophilus influenzae are integral membrane proteins, 239 and 226 amino acyl residues (aas) in length, respectively, with 7 putative transmembrane Œ±-helical segments. The structure of NadR has been determined. Mutations in the nadR gene which interfere with NR uptake occur in the C-terminal part of NadR. A helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain present in NadR of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium could not be found in the NadR homologue of H. influenzae. Therefore, it was proposed that in H. influenzae NadR has no regulatory function at the transcriptional level. The structures of the human NR kinase 1 (2QL6_P) with nucleotide and nucleoside substrates bound have been solved. It is structurally similar to Rossmann fold metabolite kinases. PnuC has been shown to resemble SWEET porters in overall fold, supporting the conclusion that these two families are members of the TOG superfamily. =Crystal structures= NadR Protein from H. influenzae NR transporter PnuC  References  Category:Biology Category:Protein families Category:Membrane proteins Category:Transmembrane proteins Category:Transmembrane transporters Category:Transport proteins Category:Integral membrane proteins ","title":"Nicotinamide ribonucleoside uptake transporters"},{"id":"49292521","title":"Nicky Jam discography"},{"id":"49292540","text":"The 2015‚Äì16 AFA Senior Male League is the seventeenth season of the AFA Senior Male League, the only football league in Anguilla.

The Aviation Hall of Fame honors individuals who played a great role in aviation and aerospace history on the national or Arkansas scene. Records are hosted by Butler Center for Arkansas Studies, Arkansas Studies Institute, Central Arkansas Library System, in Little Rock, Arkansas. History New members to the Hall of Fame were inducted annually from 1980 to 2010, and again in 2015. Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame inductees for 2015 were Jim Gaston, John Knight and James R. Risner. The hall of fame was based at the new Aerospace Education Center, 3301 East Roosevelt Road, Little Rock, Arkansas, near Little Rock National Airport, in 1995. When the Aerospace Education Center closed its doors on January 1, 2011, records were moved to the Butler Center for Arkansas Studies, Arkansas Studies Institute, which still hosts the records. In 2015, the society awarded its first two scholarships, while expressing the need for aviators to support the dreams of potential young pilots. Two students at Arkansas' collegiate aviation school, Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, received scholarships of $2,000 each. Hall of Fame Inductees 1980 J.

There are a number of different styles of tread: = Mid flight treads. = ;Straight or flier.: A standard oblong shaped tread. used in a straight flight. ;Diminishing flier.: Set into the straight section of flight before a turn, with one end narrower than the other Used to change the pitch of the handrail before a 180¬∫ turn. ;Winder.: wider at one end, used to turn the flight. ;Kite winder.: A quadrilateral shaped tread, used in the corner of a turn: hence the kite name. = Feature or starting treads. = These treads are used to embellish the start of a flight of stairs, they may have either a straight front to them or a commode/curved front to enhance them further. ;Curtail.: An ornate tread that follows the spiral of a volute handrail, the back of the tread will cut into itself and then return along the flight. ;Bullnose.: A straight tread with the front corners rounded off. ;\\"D\\" ends.: So called as they look like a D shape attached to the end of the tread. A common style that may be carried up the flight for a number of treads. ;Tower.:The tower feature is a cylindrical addition to the front corner of a tread, intended for setting a newel post onto, the tower may be positioned dependent on the handrail termination. ;Commode front.: The addition of a curve to the front of a tread to create a more decorative feature.  USAB & ADA compliance  According to the United States Access Board, stair treads in buildings shall have uniform tread depths that are 11 inches, or 280 mm, at minimum. Treads are not permitted to have a slope steeper than 1:48. All stair tread installations must comply with Regulation 302 of the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. The regulation states that the surface of the [tread] must be firm, stable, and slip- resistant.  Notable sets of stair treads  The Dylan's Candy Bar flagship location features a stair case consisting of 53 resin stair treads and three landings that are embedded with real candy and equipped with inserted abrasion strips. China's first children's design museum, Kids Museum of Glass, has alternating black and white stair treads on its central staircase, earning the nickname \\"The Piano Staircase\\". As part of the Underground Shopping Center Public Art Project, the Seoul Metropolitan Facilities Management Corporation built a piano staircase in the underground passage at Euljiro 1-ga Station. Each step lit up and played a note as it was walked on. IDEO Labs' interns created a musical staircase during summer of 2011. Each tread played a different sound when stepped on. Johns Hopkins University students turned a Hackerman Hall staircase into a piano, with a new note per step. The Hopkins Robotics Club modified the staircase so the treads played the C scale.

It has smooth, pale greenish bark, lance- shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven or nine, white flowers and ribbed, cup-shaped to hemispherical fruit.habit at Cape Freycinetfruit Description Eucalyptus calcicola is a mallee that grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, pale greenish grey bark that is shed in strips. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, broadly egg-shaped, long, wide and sessile. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped to curved, long, wide on a petiole long and are the same slightly glossy mid-green on both sides. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven or nine on a flattened peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel up to long. The mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering occurs between January and June and the flowers are white. The fruits is a woody, cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves below the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus calcicola was first formally described in 1974 by Ian Brooker from a specimen collected by K.M Allen in 1971 from near Cape Freycinet. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. In 2002, Dean Nicolle described two subspecies: * Eucalyptus calcicola subsp. calcicola has strongly ribbed fruit that is in diameter; * Eucalyptus calcicola subsp. unita has weakly ribbed fruit that is in diameter. The specific epithet (calcicola) is derived from Latin words meaning \\"limestone\\" and \\"dweller\\" referring to the habitat of this species. The epithet unita is a Latin word meaning \\"united\\", referring to this subspecies being a link between subspecies calcicola and E. ligulata. Distribution and habitat Subspecies calcicola mainly grows on limestone dunes between Cape Freycinet and Cape Hamelin in far south coastal regions of Western Australia. Subspecies unita occurs between Point Hillier near Denmark and Bremer Bay. Conservation Both subspecies of E. calcicola are classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened.

Specifically, AER includes systematic techniques honed in science and physics education to understand what and how students learn about astronomy and determine how teachers can create more effective learning environments. Education is important to astronomy as it impacts both the recruitment of future astronomers and the appreciation of astronomy by citizens and politicians who support astronomical research. Astronomy has been taught throughout much of recorded human history, and has practical application in timekeeping and navigation. Teaching astronomy contributes to an understanding of physics and the origin of the world around us, a shared cultural background, and a sense of wonder and exploration. It includes education of the general public through planetariums, books, and instructive presentations, plus programs and tools for amateur astronomy, and University-level degree programs for professional astronomers. Astronomy organizations provide educational functions and societies in about 100 nation states around the world. In schools, particularly at the collegiate level, astronomy is aligned with physics and the two are often combined to form a Department of Physics and Astronomy. Some parts of astronomy education overlap with physics education, however, astronomy education has its own arenas, practitioners, journals, and research. This can be demonstrated in the identified 20-year lag between the emergence of AER and physics education research. The body of research in this field are available through electronic sources such as the Searchable Annotated Bibliography of Education Research (SABER) and the American Astronomical Society's database of the contents of their journal \\"Astronomy Education Review\\" (see link below). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has also created a Center for Astronomy Education, a program designed to support the professional development of astronomy instructors through the NASA JPL Exoplanet Exploration Public Engagement Program and the Spitzer Education and Outreach Program.

It is based on the series of gamebooks by author Joe Dever entitled Lone Wolf. The story involves Lone Wolf adventuring to uncover the secret of the Shianti Cube. Gameplay While traditional 3D action RPG combat is the main focus on the game, plot is often delivered through first person perspective texts similar to the gamebook series. It also includes various supernatural disciplines learned by the Kai to give them otherworldly powers including the ability to psychically attack their opponents and defend against them. Plot The story takes place between Lone Wolf books four and five, titled The Chasm of Doom and Shadow on the Sand. Development A week before the Gamescon gaming convention in 2011, a teaser website was posted with the words \\"Be Kai\\", which soon after was revealed by game developer Forge Reply to be an upcoming Lone Wolf video game. Creator Joe Dever described the game as the one that finally \\"got it right\\". Dever described the game as presenting the protagonist Lone Wolf with a Batmanesque darkness while still being a \\"paragon of virtue\\". The game was developed to be more action-oriented than the books to help translate the story from book to game. Audio production studio 93 Steps was used to create the soundscape of the game, including music, sound effects and voices. The studio was curious to test how many fans Lone Wolf still had since the books went out of print in several western countries, and used Facebook to let people play through the original Lone Wolf book Flight from the Dark, and vote every time there was a choice of direction in the story. Reception Pocket Gamer praised the interactive text that transforms as you make choices into a 3D game with combat done through a 3rd person perspective. TouchArcade gave the game a 4/5 star rating, saying the game was exciting taking on the role of guiding the protagonist Lone Wolf through the adventure, but had trouble capturing the fun of the gamebooks they originated from.

He operates restaurants East Side King (Austin), Thai Kuhn (Austin) and Pao (Miami). In 2011, he won the ninth season of reality television cooking competition Top Chef. Qui is also a winner of the James Beard Award.  Biography  Paul Qui was born in Manila, Philippines and moved to the United States as a child. He attended high school in Springfield, Virginia and completed his culinary training at Le Cordon Bleu in Austin, Texas. His initial forays into cooking professionally led to a job with Tyson Cole, chef/owner of Uchi and Uchiko restaurants in Austin.

Early life Marin was raised in Oak Harbor, north of Seattle, Washington. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he attended Brigham Young University and served a mission in Japan, where he learned Japanese. After college, he attended Yale Law School and was admitted to the New York State Bar Association in 1987. Career Marin went to work in the legal departments of banks, which sent him back to Japan. He made a fortune trading in complex investments in the 1980s and '90s, working for Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Salomon Brothers mainly in their operations in Asia. His children were raised in Asia and Chicago. His wife, Tammy, left him in 1992, after 12 years of marriage. Marin returned to the United States, after being let go by Lehman Brothers in 1997. He led a lavish lifestyle, buying a multimillion-dollar mansion in Arizona and collecting works of art that included etchings by Pablo Picasso. He traveled extensively throughout the Far East. A book he wrote about investment banking in Asia, Fluctuations, recounts his adventures in Papua New Guinea, Cambodia and Malaysia. An avid thrill seeker and adventurer, he travelled to many exotic climes and summited the highest peaks of six continents, including Mount Everest. Arson charge Marin bought a mansion in the Biltmore Estates neighborhood of Phoenix in September 2008, doing so after a friend and business partner had lost the property to foreclosure and paying for it through a complex series of transactions. It came with a monthly mortgage payment of $17,250 and an imminent $2.3 million balloon payment. In spring 2009, Marin devised a lottery to sell the house with profit, with some funds going to a charity he had chosen, a crisis center for children. However, the state authorities determined that the lottery was illegal and shut it down. The lottery drawing was supposed to be on July 4, 2009. The following day, Marin called 911 to report his house on fire. He claimed to have escaped the blaze by wearing scuba gear and lowering himself down from the second-floor with a rope ladder. Fire department investigators determined the fire was deliberate after finding several points of origin throughout the house. Death Marin was tried for arson and insurance fraud for setting his home on fire. Court hearings started on May 21, 2012, and Marin faced 7 to 21 years in prison if convicted. The jury found Marin guilty on June 28, 2012. Soon after the verdict, and being informed that he was to be taken into custody immediately, he committed suicide in court. He was seen in court videos closing his eyes as the verdict was being read, before appearing to put something in his mouth and drinking a liquid in a plastic water bottle, then fell to the floor a few minutes later in convulsions. Marin was rushed to a central hospital in Phoenix and was pronounced dead; an autopsy confirmed he had taken a lethal dose of cyanide. He had bought a canister of cyanide in May 2011, from a California mail-order chemical supplier. At time of his death, he was a father of four and a grandfather of two.

Orders for its construction were issued by Ferdinand VI of Spain on 9 April 1749, following the decision by the naval minister Zen√≥n de Somodevilla, 1st Marqu√©s de la Ensenada, to build new naval fortifications and installations in Ferrol and its surrounding area. Initial construction was managed by Cosme √Ålvarez, Comandante General of the Department. It was sited on the northwest slope of the monte Esteiro near Ferrol. It was initially planned to have four levels, but by the end this rose to twelve, proportional to the mountain's slope. Barracks, workshops and warehouses were also built. Ships built at Esteiro ='Apostles'= At its height, through an order by the Marquis de la Ensenada dated 15 July 1752, the shipyard simultaneously built twelve 68-gun ships of the line simultaneously, popularly known as the \\"Twelve Apostles\\" or \\"Apostolate\\" class. The survivors of this group were each subsequently raised to 74 guns. This project greatly increased the arsenal's industrial activity, boosting the local civilian economy and increasing the town's population by drawing in the skilled workers needed. The twelve ships (with their years of launching) were: *Oriente, also known as San Diego de Alcal√° (launched 1753), *√âolo or San Juan de Dios (1753), *Neptuno or San Justo (1754), *Magn√°nimo or San Justo y San Pastor (1754), *Aquil√≥n or San D√°maso (1754), *Gallardo or San Juan de Sahag√∫n (1754), *Brillante or San Dionisio (1754), *Vencedor or San Juli√°n (1755), *Glorioso or San Francisco Javier (1755), *Guerrero or San Raimundo (1755), *H√©ctor or San Bernardo (1755), *Soberano or San Gregorio (1755). =Other warships with number of guns (and year when launched) = *San Fernando - 64 guns (1751) *Castilla - 64 (1751) *Asia - 62 (1752) *Galga - frigate of 30 guns (1752) *San Miguel - snow of 14 guns (1752) *Triunfante - 68 (1756) *Dichoso - 68 (1756) *Monarca - 68 (1756) *Diligente - 68 (1756) *San Fernando - snow of 14 guns (1757) *Campeon - 60 (1758) *San Isidro - 74 (1768) *San Julian - 74 (1768) *Santa Ana - 112 (1784) *Salvador del Mundo - 112 (1787) *Europa - 74 (1789) *Reina Mar√≠a Luisa - 112 (1791) *Monarca - 74 (1791) *Duque de Tetu√°n - floating battery (1875) *Eulalia - gunboat (1882) *Concha - gunboat (1883)  Bibliography  *Un Episodio de Ferrol de la Ilustraci√≥n. de Juan J.

Education Malcolm received her B.A. from Barnard College and her M.A. and Ph.D. from Brandeis University. Career Malcolm taught at Bentley University from 1988 to 2006, serving as an associate professor of history for the first four of these years and a full professor for the remaining fourteen. In 2006, she joined George Mason University and became the Patrick Henry Professor of Constitutional Law and the Second Amendment there, a position she has held ever since. The position is wholly funded by the National Rifle Association (NRA).https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nra-money-helped- reshape-gun-law/2013/03/13/73d71e22-829a-11e2-b99e-6baf4ebe42df_story.html Her other positions prior to joining George Mason University included professorships at Princeton University, Boston University, Northeastern University and Cambridge University. Work on the Second Amendment and gun control Malcolm is the author of the book To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right, published in 1994 by Harvard University Press. The book details the origin of the Second Amendment in the American Constitution, which, according to the book, lies in a British tradition of maintaining a civilian army to counteract tyranny. In the book, Malcolm also claims that beginning in the 14th century, even as firearm ownership became more common over the following five centuries, violent crime rates declined. She has been called one of the five \\"inner circle\\" proponents of the \\"Standard Model\\" interpretation of the Second Amendment, along with Robert J. Cottrol, Stephen P. Halbrook, Don B. Kates, and Robert E. Shalhope. =Views on gun control= In 2012, Malcolm wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal stating that strict gun control laws enacted after mass shootings in Britain and Australia \\"haven't made their people noticeably safer, nor have they prevented massacres.\\" The following year, she told PBS NewsHour that she thought the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 was unconstitutional because recent Supreme Court decisions had found that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own guns that are commonly used for protection. Other work Malcolm is also the author of Peter's War: A New England Slave Boy and the American Revolution, a 2009 book that tells the story of the American Revolution from the perspective of an enslaved boy named Peter Sharon, who fought in the colonies' army during the war.

It also provides guidance on when the Court will consider constitutional issues when such had not been argued in the lower courts. Background Guindon, a lawyer who specialized in family and wills and estates law, was approached in 2001 by promoters of a leveraged donation program which was said to operate in the following manner: #Each participant in the program would acquire timeshare units of a resort in the Turks and Caicos Islands. #The participants would donate these units to a charity at a fair market value greater than their cash payment for the timeshares. Guindon agreed, for a fee, to provide an opinion letter on the tax consequences of this program on the basis of a precedent provided by the promoters. Although recommending that a tax lawyer and an accountant review her letter for accuracy, she proceeded to provide the letter to the promoters, knowing it would form part of their information package. The letter stated that the transactions would be implemented based on supporting documents that she had been provided with and had reviewed. However, she had not reviewed the supporting documents.SCC, par. 6 A charity with which Guindon was connected agreed to become the recipient of the promoted timeshares. In reality, no timeshare units were created and no transfers from the donors to the charity occurred.SCC, par. 7 The Minister of National Revenue later disallowed the charitable donation tax credits claimed by the donors, and Guindon was assessed an administrative monetary penalty in 2008 for each of the tax receipts disallowed,SCC, par. 6 amounting in total to almost $600,000. Guindon appealed the assessment to the Tax Court of Canada, submitting that s. 163.2 of the Income Tax Act created a criminal offence, and thus was subject to the Charter protection afforded under s.11.SCC, par. 9 The courts below The TCC held that s. 163.2 was \\"by its very nature a criminal proceeding\\" and \\"involve[d] a sanction that is a true penal consequence,\\"TCC, par. 53 and in consequence vacated the assessment. Protests by the Crown that the constitutional issue was raised without proper notice were overruled by the trial judge B√©dard J.SCC, par. 9 The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the TCC's judgment, and restored the assessment against Guindon. In his ruling, Stratas JA held that:SCC, par. 12 #Guindon‚Äôs failure to serve notice of a constitutional question was fatal to the Tax Court‚Äôs jurisdiction; #the TCC and the FCA, if asked to do so, could have exercised their discretion to adjourn the appeal to allow a notice to be served to address that matter, but Guindon did not make that request in either of the courts below; and #s. 163.2 of the ITA is not a criminal offence and therefore does not engage s. 11 of the Charter. Leave to appeal to the SCC was granted in June 2013. At the SCC By a unanimous decision, the appeal was dismissed. However, the Justices split 4:3 as to whether the constitutional issue should have been considered without prior notice, and only the majority addressed the constitutional issue. =Discretion of the Court= While the minority considered the Court's prior ruling in Eaton v Brant County Board of Education as requiring a mandatory notice of a constitutional question, as it \\"gives governments an opportunity to present evidence justifying the constitutionality of the law and permits all parties to challenge that evidence,\\" and \\"allowing a party unilaterally to make an end-run around notice requirements by claiming that demonstrably constitutional arguments are not in fact constitutional arguments, rewards linguistic tactics at the expense of the public interest.\\"SCC, par. 92-97 The majority held that Eaton was not conclusive, as Sopinka J's judgment did not express a final opinion on the point. In addition, there have been numerous instances both before and after Eaton where the Court has addressed constitutional questions de novo without prior notice.SCC, par. 15-39 =Engagement of s. 11= S. 11 protection is available to those charged with criminal offences, not those subject to administrative sanctions, according to the test the Court has devised in R v Wigglesworth, which declares that a matter falls under s. 11 where; #by its very nature it is a criminal proceeding, or #a conviction in respect of the offence may lead to a true penal consequence.Wigglesworth, par. 21 In addition, Martineau v MNR declares that, in general, \\"proceedings of an administrativeprivate, internal or disciplinarynature instituted for the protection of the public in accordance with the policy of a statute are not penal in nature.\\"Martineau, par. 22, citing Wigglesworth, par. 23-24 To determine whether a proceeding is criminal or administrative in nature, the Court must examine \\"(1) the objectives of the [Act]; (2) the purpose of the sanction; and (3) the process leading to imposition of the sanction.\\"Martineau, par. 24 In the present case, the Court declared that criticisms that the Wigglesworth/Martineau tests were unclear, circular in nature or not properly accounting for the modern context of administrative monetary penalties were unfounded, as: #the \\"criminal in nature test\\" identifies provisions that are criminal because Parliament or the legislature has provided for proceedings whose attributes and purpose show that the penalty is to be imposed via criminal proceedings; and #the \\"true penal consequence test\\" looks at whether an ostensibly administrative or regulatory provision nonetheless engages s. 11 of the Charter because it may result in punitive consequences.SCC, par. 49 In the case at bar, s. 163.2(4) of the ITA was held: #not to be a criminal proceeding in nature, as \\"the purpose of this proceeding is to promote honesty and deter gross negligence, or worse, on the part of preparers, qualities that are essential to the self-reporting system of income taxation assessment\\"SCC, par. 62 and \\"[w]hile some regulatory penalties are imposed without consideration of the person‚Äôs state of mind, in other cases it is rational that the state would only wish to impose a penalty on those who engage in misconduct knowingly, recklessly, or with a particular intention.\\"SCC, par. 72 #not to attract a true penal consequence, as \\"high administrative monetary penalties [are] required to encourage compliance with the administrative regime. The relevant question is not the amount of the penalty in absolute terms, it is whether the amount serves regulatory rather than penal purposes.\\"SCC, par. 81 Impact Several practical consequences were immediately apparent in Guindon: #If constitutional litigation is to be conducted, procedural requirements as to notice must be followed. #The integrity and honesty of advisors, planners and tax preparers is equally important to the integrity of the self- reporting system. #The objectives of the Income Tax Act are such that, at least in general terms, very significant penalties will not be prohibited by constitutional principles. Commentators generally agree that Guindon is only a first step in the development of the case law concerning administrative proceedings: :* It does not discuss the defences available against the imposition of AMPs nor the issue of the burden of proof, but the matter has already been explored in a 2015 case in Quebec.Excavation Ren√© St-Pierre Inc. c Qu√©bec, 2015 QCTAQ 02386 :* The Charter is not the only source of judicial protection in administrative proceedings, as procedural and substantive challenges on judicial review can ensure that the administration stays within the boundaries of legality. :* The absence of s. 11 protection of the presumption of innocence is of great concern, although it is conceded that the legal system may grind to a halt if every allegation of misconduct could be tested in a full criminal proceeding. :* It will be difficult to challenge other AMPs imposed in the absence of procedural safeguards. :* The FCA provided more guidance in its judgment as to when an administrative penalty would be considered disproportionate,FCA, par. 44 and it would have been helpful if the SCC had expanded on the point. However, in 2012 the Ontario Court of Appeal gave a reasoned evaluation for a monetary penalty that arose from a securities proceeding, which could be useful in future jurisprudence.

The car was designed in the early 2000s and was based on the earlier Siemens Viaggio Classic railcars. The railcars were first used in 2008 on Railjet, a high-speed rail service in Europe operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) and Czech Railways (ƒåD).  History  Siemens first produced the Viaggio Comfort railcars in response to a request by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) for locomotive-hauled push-pull trainsets for its upcoming Railjet high-speed rail service. Typically, high- speed rail services use electric multiple units, but √ñBB had recently purchased a fleet of Siemens EuroSprinter electric locomotives that it wanted to continue to use. After a bidding process, it was announced in February 2006 that the Siemens Viaggio Comfort was the best design as well as the least expensive.Marl, Pettauer, railjet, Slide 7 The initial February 2006 order was for 23 sets of 7-coach trains, which was followed by a second order by √ñBB for 44 more sets in September 2007.

The first Railjet commercial service started on 14 December 2008. Between September 2011 and May 2012, Czech Railways (ƒåD) negotiated to have seven of the trainsets ordered by √ñBB transferred to it, for use on its high- speed rail service which would also be called Railjet. The Viaggio Comfort railcars went into service with ƒåD on 15 June 2014. In July 2018 the Czech Railways ordered 10 5-car trainsets for domestic services. They should operate on Prague - Cheb line from 2021. These units have decreased maximum speed to and they haven't the control car.

The murder cases were widely publicized, and were featured on the television series Unsolved Mysteries in 1989. Case =Harkins and Cooper= On August 10, 1985, Steven Harkins, 27, and his girlfriend, Ruth Cooper, 42, left their Tacoma, Washington home for a weekend camping trip at Tule Lake in Pierce County. When the two did not return to their jobs at a Tacoma vocational school the following Monday, their families reported them missing. Four days later, on August 14, hikers passing through Pierce County found Harkins' body near a remote campsite. He had been shot in the head, and his body, still in a sleeping bag, suggested he had been murdered while sleeping. Nearby, searchers also found Harkins' and Cooper's pet dog, who had been shot to death as well. At the time, law enforcement suspected that the case may have been connected to the murders of Edward Smith and Kimberly Diane La Vine, a couple from Kent, Washington who were abducted, murdered, and disposed of in a gravel pit near the Columbia River in March 1985. On October 26, a skull was found at the dead end of Eighth Avenue South, near Harts Lake, about 1.5 miles from where Harkins' body was found. Dental records confirmed the skull belonged to Cooper, and two days later on October 28, her body and her purse were also recovered from the area, fifty feet from where her skull had been found. A tube sock had been tied around Cooper's neck. According to the autopsy, Cooper had died of \\"homicidal violence,\\" though a spokesman later stated she had died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen. After the discovery of Cooper, the murders were publicized by Crime Stoppers in an attempt to recover information leading to the arrest of those responsible. =Riemer and Robertson= Terrain in Pierce County, Washington, where the murders occurred Over a month after the discovery of Ruth Cooper, on December 12, 1985, Mike Riemer, 36, his girlfriend, Diana Robertson, 21, and their daughter, Crystal Louise Robertson, age 2, traveled from their Tacoma home to Pierce County, planning to find a camp site near the Nisqually River. Riemer, an animal trapper, also planned to check on traps he had set in the area. Later that evening, customers at a Kmart store thirty miles north in Spanaway found the couple's daughter, Crystal, standing outside the store entrance. Crystal was placed in temporary foster care until her maternal grandmother saw her photograph on a local news broadcast two days later. When asked where her mother was, the dazed two-year-old told her grandmother that her \\"Mommy was in the trees.\\" According to investigators, the two-year-old was \\"not nearly verbal enough\\" to provide any information. Police searched the area both on foot and by air, looking for evidence of Riemer's red 1982 Plymouth pickup truck, but efforts remained fruitless. On February 18, 1986, over two months after the couple's disappearance, the body of Diana Robertson was discovered half-buried in snow by a motorist near a logging road off of Washington State Route 7 in Mineral. Bloodhounds scoured the area in the following days, but six inches of snowfall impeded the search. Riemer's pickup truck was also found near Robertson's body. In the truck, police discovered a note on the dashboard that read \\"I love you, Diana.\\" It was written on a manila envelope. Robertson's mother claimed the handwriting was that of Riemer. Bloodstains were also found on the seat of the truck. An autopsy revealed that Diana Robertson had been stabbed seventeen times, and, as with Ruth Cooper, was also found with a tube sock tied around her neck. Due to Riemer's disappearance, investigators believed he may have been responsible for Robertson's murder, and had abandoned his daughter at the Kmart store and then subsequently fled. Police theorized that Riemer may have been responsible for Harkins' and Cooper's murders as well; an alternate theory, however, claimed that Riemer was also a victim of the same killer who had murdered Robertson, Harkins, and Cooper. In February 1986, after the discovery of Robertson's body, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published an article revealing that Riemer had been charged with domestic assault against Robertson on October 19, 1985. However, the couple had reconciled by December, the month in which they disappeared. Riemer, who worked as a roofer at Seattle‚Äôs Queen City Sheet Metal and Roofing Inc., was described by his employer as a \\"typical roofer who worked hard and played hard.\\" =2011 development= On March 26, 2011, hikers discovered a partial human skull later determined to be that of Mike Riemer. It was found in an area within a mile radius of where Robertson's body had been discovered in 1986. After recovery of the skull, Lewis County investigators stated that they believed Riemer could have been a possible victim of homicide as well, though his cause of death could not be determined. Based on the condition of the skull, however, authorities were able to rule out a gunshot wound to the head.

Intrapsychic humanism is a nonderivative depth psychology that provides a unified and comprehensive theory of child development, psychopathology, and psychological treatment. The theory is based on groundbreaking discoveries about the centrality of the caregiving relationship in both child development and psychological treatment. It provides an approach to psychotherapy called inner humanism which helps individuals with emotional pain achieve unconflicted pleasurable inner well-being. The theory of intrapsychic humanism also engenders an approach to parenting called \\"smart love\\" that offers the potential to raise children who can have a conflict free, pleasurable, self- regulated experience of inner well-being, even in a world of inescapable loss.  Authors  Intrapsychic humanism was developed by two psychotherapists and child development experts in Chicago, Martha Heineman Pieper, Ph.D., and William J. Pieper, M.D. Martha Heineman Pieper, Ph.D., earned her doctorate in social work at the School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago. She has been a consultant to foster care and adoption agencies and has written and lectured extensively on clinical issues and the philosophy of science and research. She has served on the editorial boards of Social Work, Illinois Child Welfare, and Smith College Studies in Social Work. Heineman Pieper maintains a private practice doing psychotherapy, counseling parents, and supervising mental health professionals. She is the primary consultant to the Natalie G. Heineman Smart Love Preschool and Smart Love Family Services Mental Health Clinic. William J. Pieper, who died in 2014, was a child and adult psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who served on the staff of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. He completed psychiatry residencies at the University of Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute in Chicago and the Institute for Juvenile Research in Chicago. William Pieper was awarded certificates in both child and adult psychoanalysis from the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. He consulted with children's agencies and hospital clinics and taught at various professional schools. William Pieper spent many years in private practice seeing individuals, counseling parents, and supervising mental health professionals.  Publications  The Piepers‚Äô theory was first published in a seminal academic book for professionals entitled, Intrapsychic Humanism: An Introduction to a Comprehensive Psychology and Philosophy of Mind (Falcon II Press, 1990). Subsequently, the Piepers introduced an approach to parenting called Smart Love which was first published in 1999 by The Harvard Common Press and which was reissued by Smart Love Press in 2011 as Smart Love: The Comprehensive Guide to Understanding, Regulating, and Enjoying Your Child 2. Smart Love has been translated into over fifteen languages. In 2002 the Piepers published a self-help book for adults, Addicted to Unhappiness: Free Yourself from Moods and Behaviors that Undermine Relationships, Work, and the Life You Want (McGraw-Hill, 2002, 2004). Most recently, Dr. Martha Heineman Pieper wrote an award-winning children's book based on Intrapsychic Humanism that addresses the meaning of children's dreams and fantasy play (Mommy, Daddy, I had a Bad Dream!, Smart Love Press, 2012). The book won thirteen awards including the Ben Franklin Award for Best Children's Picture Book 2012. In addition to their books, the Piepers have authored numerous scholarly publications. The Piepers authored the column ‚ÄúSmart Love‚Äù for ten years in Chicago Parent. Those columns are collected in two volumes published by Smart Love Family Services: Smart Love Solutions in Early Childhood and Smart Love Solutions for School-Age Children and Teens. Development of the Theory. The Piepers concluded that prevailing theories of child development did not offer adequate answers to the perennial questions posed by parents and mental health professionals. In their research, they addressed these questions, such as: What is a baby's basic nature at birth? How much happiness can humans rightfully expect? How and why does happiness transform itself into unhappiness? In the Piepers‚Äô words: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ [W]e set out on our own to find answers that would allow us to be better parents and more effective professionals. We learned from the insights and dilemmas of the many parents we counseled, from our own clients, and from supervising the caseloads of other mental health professionals. We evaluated the results of the counsel we gave to parents and to foster care and adoption agencies. As another way of testing our ideas, we created and ran a successful treatment program for adolescent wards of the state who had been designated ‚Äòuntreatable‚Äô. Our research* and experience taught us that the emotional problems of children and adolescents couldn't be treated piecemeal or solely as individual behaviors that need to be modified. We found that troubled children are difficult to help because they have learned to need unhappiness. We saw that the real goal is to help troubled children turn away from needs for unhappiness as they rediscover the desires for positive relationship pleasure with which they were born,\\". Intrapsychic Humanism was the result of this process. Basic Principles of Intrapsychic Humanism Child Development. While some theories have recognized that relationships are important in life, Intrapsychic Humanism provides a complete theory of mind, development, and psychopathology that asserts the primacy and critical importance of relationship experience, particularly the caregiving relationship. How is inner well-being achieved? According to Intrapsychic Humanism, infants are born with an innate motive to be the cause of the parents‚Äô caregiving; this sense of purpose is embodied in the imagined, but yet-to-be-attained, goal of receiving ideal care from the parents. The way to understand a child's subjective experience, that is, her/his experience of being alive, of being loved and being lovable, is to understand this sense of purpose with which s/he comes into the world. The essential discovery of Intrapsychic Humanism is this particular kind of purpose which the Piepers call the intrapsychic motive. The intrapsychic motive, i.e., the motive to regulate one's own inner well-being by causing the caregiver's caregiving, drives the process through which the baby learns who s/he is, provides the lens through which s/he views the world, and ultimately defines the core meaning of subjective personal existence and leads to the core experience of well-being. Intrapsychic Humanism is based on the assertion that every individual comes into the world innately programmed for relationship experience and that everything that happens to them has the meaning of ideal love. Every baby believes s/he is born into the best of all possible worlds‚Äîa world where ideal care is being provided. Intrapsychic Humanism is based on an understanding of this essential element of human nature and the theory identifies a type of caregiving that can offer the child the caregiving experiences that can ultimately provide her/him with the sense of fundamental, stable well-being that can last a lifetime. Intrapsychic Humanism provides a map that allows parents and other caregivers to provide caregiving appropriate to the child's psychological development. The stages of child development as understood by Intrapsychic Humanism are: The Pre-Eidetic Stage; The Regulatory Intrapsychic Self Stage; The Regulatory Interpersonal Self Stage; and The Constitutive Interpersonal Self Stage. Pre-Eidetic Stage (birth to 12-14 months): The Pre-Eidetic Stage includes the smile response, stranger anxiety and separation anxiety. During this stage, the child gains the capacity to remember images of her parents to which she can then turn to feel that she is causing her parents to care for her while she explores more and more of her world. Most importantly, during this stage every experience and feeling the baby has is believed to be a result of intentional caregiving from the parent. Regulatory Intrapsychic Self Stage (12-14 months to approximately 3 years): Although a relatively short period of time, this stage is perhaps the most fecund period of development because the baby progresses from an innate (nature-based) experience of the parent's caregiving, to a nurture-based genuine experience of her mind that provides her with the foundation for a stable sense of well-being throughout her life. Through the parents‚Äô stable caregiving the child comes to prefer above all the pleasure of being cared for by them and to become certain of the stability of the parents' commitment to care for her. By the end of this stage, the child will have internalized a certainty that her parents‚Äô love for her is unshakable. Regulatory Interpersonal Self Stage (approximately 3 years to 6-7 years): Once the child has established a stable inner well-being, the next goal is to gain the capacity to regulate his choices in his interpersonal world, such as to play and to make friends. During the Regulatory Interpersonal Self Stage, the child goes through the romantic phase in which he/she has the illusion that he can have an exclusive romantic relationship with the opposite sex parent. Over time he comes to realize that while he/she cannot have nor regulate his parents' social motives he/she can always regulate their caregiving motives. At the end of this stage, which occurs at about ages 6 or 7, the child's growing appreciation of his parents‚Äô steadfast discrimination between their parenting and personal commitments leads him/her to make an identification called the relationship ideal. The relationship ideal consists of ideals of intimacy and commitment in all types of relationships, including romantic love, friendship, and the parent-child relationship. It is the relationship ideal that becomes the basis for relationship choices throughout his/her life. Constitutive Interpersonal Self Stage (6-7 years to early adulthood): This stage is the final phase of development of the child's mind, from approximately age 6 through early adulthood (age 20-30). During this stage, the child increasingly learns to make self-caretaking choices and by the end of this phase s/he has the capacity to enjoy life, to work hard, to pursue desires and relationships, and to cope with losses or disappointments without conflict and without loss of self-esteem. Psychopathology. As stated, all children are born with the conviction that they are causing their parents to care for them and that they are receiving ideal care. Because of this conviction and the immaturity of the child's mind, children cannot evaluate the quality of care they receive. Consequently, even if caregiving is less than ideal, it will still be experienced as ideal and pleasurable. As a result of this dynamic, our species has the ability to survive even when the caregiving is less than optimal. It also creates a vulnerability in that human beings feel loved and cared for even with destructive, abusive or neglectful caregiving. This results in a lifetime addiction to unhappiness because unhappiness is mistakenly identified as well-being. For example, young children who are abused will accept the abuse as deserved, inevitable, and, even, as ideal caregiving. This misidentification of unhappiness as happiness explains why foster children will frequently instigate and provoke conflict with kind, well-meaning foster parents. The Piepers call this dynamic the aversive reaction to pleasure where people who have learned to need unhappiness react to genuine pleasure by unknowingly seeking out experiences of unhappiness. The aversive reaction to pleasure explains the phenomenon of people who reach the pinnacle of success and then end up self-destructing. People with unrecognized needs for unhappiness are also vulnerable when faced with disappointments or loss. In response to loss, they have difficulty comforting themselves and try to feel better by unknowingly recreating unhappy experiences, such as feeling badly about themselves, isolating, overeating, fighting or abusing others. Treatment. Psychotherapy that is based on the theory of Intrapsychic Humanism is called inner Humanism. Even when people receive less than ideal care growing up, they still possess their innate motive for genuine well-being. The goal of Inner Humanism is to reawaken and nurture this innate motive via the caregiving relationship with the therapist. ‚ÄúIn [Inner Humanism psychotherapy], the therapist has the caregiving pleasure of nurturing the client‚Äôs heretofore unengaged motives to experience reliable, conflict-free care-getting intimacy. The client‚Äôs experience of receiving the caregetting he/she needs acquires the meaning of an inner well-being that he/she causes and regulates. Intrapsychic care-getting pleasure refers not to an affect, but to a meaning structure of effective agency nurtured by the client‚Äôs experience of causing the therapist to want to give the emotional care the client needs and desires. The mechanism of therapeutic change is not insight, but here and now caregetting pleasure produced by the client‚Äôs experience of causing the therapist to meet her care getting needs. Over time, the superiority of this type of relationship-based self-regulation leads the client to reject as an unnecessary and unwanted loss the type of self- regulation that is based on motives for pain with the unconscious meaning of pleasure‚Äù. A key mechanism in the therapeutic process is the aversive reaction to pleasure. The client's motives for constructive pleasure and the pleasure of the caregiving intimacy with the therapist compete with their acquired motives for unhappiness. When the client pursues constructive motives, needs for unhappiness press for gratification until backsliding occurs. A common example is the client who forgets a session in reaction to the pleasure of feeling well taken care of by the therapist. This backsliding is called an aversive reaction to pleasure. Aversive reactions to pleasure are a pivotal part of the healing process because they make heretofore unrecognized, learned needs for unhappiness available and therefore, amenable, to the treatment. Criticisms  Footnote  *To test the efficacy of their clinical approach, the Piepers were invited by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to develop a demonstration project to provide residential treatment for the most violent, anti-social adolescent wards of the state. These severely emotionally disturbed, homicidally violent adolescents had been considered untreatable. Over the course of treatment (1974‚Äì1977), the project demonstrated that even individuals with the most severe psychopathology proved amenable to psychotherapeutic interventions based on the principles of Intrapsychic Humanism.

Mediterranean Force B was first formed by the Mediterranean Fleet in July 1940. Comprising the battleship and five destroyers, it saw action at the Battle of Calabria under the command of Vice Admiral Andrew Cunningham. In November 1940 it was involved in Operation MB8, a multi-faceted operation involving several forces with different but co- ordinated aims. During this period Force B comprised the cruisers and and delivered reinforcements to Crete. The force sailed on 4 November with convoy AN 6 en route to Greece, departing that evening to Crete, then heading north to join Force C (cruiser ) at Pireaus. From there the combined force under the command of Vice Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell moved east into the Straits of Otranto to divert the Italian Fleet whilst the balance of the British forces attacked the port of Taranto in Operation Judgement. Whilst in the straits, the cruisers intercepted an Italian convoy of four ships and destroyed three. In March 1941, again under Pridham-Whippel, Ajax and the cruisers Orion, and formed Force B in an operation to bring the Italian fleet to battle, resulting in the Battle of Cape Matapan. In June Force B was re-formed to assist Allied forces in the Syria‚ÄìLebanon Campaign with Ajax, Phoebe and four destroyers. During this period ships of the force were engaged by Vichy submarine Caiman, which was damaged in a two-hour hunt, and the destroyers Guepard and Valmy, which left the destroyer Janus badly damaged. In November Force B (comprising Ajax, and two destroyers, and and under the command of Rear Admiral Bernard Rawlings was moved to Malta to reinforce the ships of Force K already there and to carry out offensive sweeps for Axis supply ships en route to Libya. On 19 December, after taking part in conveying a supply ship into Malta in Operation MD 8 which had led to the First Battle of Sirte, Force B was deployed to find the Italian convoy encountered in that engagement but fell foul of a minefield off Tripoli, resulting in the loss of Neptune and Kandahar and damage to two other ships. After this, forces B and K were withdrawn from Malta. Indian Ocean With the outbreak of war in the Pacific and the advance of the Japanese on Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, British naval forces in the Far east were forced to retreat, first to Java, then to Trincomalee, in Ceylon. In March 1942 Admiral James Somerville took command of a force of 29 warships, many approaching obsolescence. To remedy this deficiency he divided his ships into fast and slow divisions, Force A and Force B respectively. This Force B comprised four WWI-vintage Revenge class battleships, the light carrier , the cruisers and and destroyers , , and . These were joined by Dutch cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck and destroyer Isaac Sweers, and RAN destroyers and .Eastern Fleet order of battle at valka.cz This force came under the command of Rear Admiral Algernon Willis. This force came under attack during the Japanese Indian Ocean raid and on 9 April Hermes and Vampire were sunk by aircraft from the Japanese carrier strike force Kido Butai. After this Force B was withdrawn to Kilindini, in British East Africa, where it was based until the RN could recoup its position in the theatre. Force B's only major action, apart from escort duty was to support Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Vichy-held Madagascar, in May 1942, during which was attacked and damaged by Japanese midget submarines in Diego Suarez harbour.

History She and her 11 sister ships were ordered on 15 June 1752 and their keels laid later that year at the Reales Astilleros de Esteiro. She belonged to the series popularly known as the 12 apostles or the Apostolate, all constructed simultaneously in the same shipyard by the British shipwright Rooth between 1753 and 1755 using the English method or by Jorge Juan y Santacilia. She was launched on 10 March 1754, entering service with 68 guns like the other 11 ships (some of the others later expanded to 74 guns). In mid-1754, under the command of Captain Francisco Lastarr√≠a, she sailed from Ferrol to Cadiz until December of that year. In April 1755 she was anchored in ordinary at the Arsenal de la Carraca, where it was found that she leaked and her wood rotted easily as with other ships built using the Gazta√±eta method. From August 1755 onwards she underwent several modifications before being stationed at Cartegena to fight Algerian pirates as part of Gutierre de Hevia's squadron between 1759 and 1761. On 4 March 1761 she and the Soberano sailed from Cartagena, arriving in Cadiz on 24 March, transporting a total of 650 men of the 2nd battalion of the Aragon Infantry Regiment, of which 327 were on board the Aquil√≥n. At Cadiz they were joined by the Tigre, Asia, Vencedor and Conquistador and the six ships sailed under de Hevia's commandon 14 April for Havana, arriving on 27 June after dropping off some troops in Puerto Rico and Santiago de Cuba. During their stay in Havana there was an outbreak of black vomiting, lasting until 1761 and causing 1,800 casualties among the troops and crews. On 6 June 1762 she was surprised in the Bay of Havana by a British squadron of 53 ships of the line and 25,000 soldiers and sailors under admiral George Pocock. Her captain Vicente Gonz√°lez-Valor y Bassecourt, marqu√©s de Gonz√°lez was killed in the defence of El Morro and replaced by Diego Argote. On 9 June she was ordered to the coves of Regla and Guanabacoa. On 24 June she was hit 78 times by the British.

The NRAMP family is a member of the large APC Superfamily of secondary carriers. Homologues of this family are found in various yeasts, plants, animals, archaea, and Gram- negative and Gram-positive bacteria termed \\"natural resistance-associated\\" macrophage proteins because one of the animal homologues plays a role in resistance to intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Leishmania donovani and Mycobacterium bovis. The natural history of SLC11 genes in vertebrates has been discussed by Neves et al. (2011). Proposed to be a distant member of the APC Superfamily, several human pathologies may result from defects in NRAMP-dependent Fe2+ or Mn2+ transport, including iron overload, neurodegenerative diseases and innate susceptibility to infectious diseases. NRAMP2 Humans and rodents possess two distinct NRAMPs. The broad specificity NRAMP2 (DMT1), which transports a range of divalent metal cations, transports Fe2+ and H+ with a 1:1 stoichiometry and apparent affinities of 6 Œºm and about 1 Œºm, respectively. Variable H+:Fe2+ stoichiometry has also been reported. The order of substrate preference for NRAMP2 is: Fe2+> Zn2+> Mn2+> Co2+> Ca2+> Cu2+> Ni2+> Pb2+ Many of these ions can inhibit iron absorption. Mutation of NRAMP2 in rodents leads to defective endosomal iron export within the ferritin cycle, impaired intestinal iron absorption and microcytic anemia. Symptoms of Mn2+ deficiency are also seen. It is found in apical membranes of intestinal epithelial cells but also in late endosomes and lysosomes. NRAMP1 In contrast to the widely expressed NRAMP2, NRAMP1 is expressed primarily in macrophages and monocytes and appears to have a preference for Mn2+ rather than Fe2+. NRAMP1 (TC# 2.A.55.2.3) has been reported to function by metal:H+ antiport. It is hypothesized that a deficiency for Mn2+ or some other metal prevents the generation of reactive oxygenic and nitrogenic compounds that are used by macrophage to combat pathogens. This hypothesis is supported by studies on the bacterial NRAMP homologues which exhibit extremely high selectivity for Mn2+ over Fe2+, Zn2+ and other divalent cations. Regulation of these transporters in bacteria can occur through Fur, OxyR, and most commonly a DtxR homolog, MntR. Smf and other homologues The Smf1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae appears to catalyze high-affinity (KM = 0.3 Œºm) Mn2+ uptake while the closely related Smf2 protein may catalyze low affinity (KM = 60 Œºm) Mn2+ uptake in the same organism. Both proteins also mediate H+-dependent Fe2+ uptake. These proteins are of 575 and 549 amino acyl residues in length and are predicted to have 8-12 transmembrane Œ±-helical spanners. The E. coli homologue of 412 aas exhibits 11 putative and confirmed TMSs with the N-terminus in and the C-terminus out. The yeast proteins may be localized to the vacuole and/or the plasma membrane of the yeast cell. Indirect and some direct experiments suggest that they may be able to transport several heavy metals including Mn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ and Co2+. A third yeast protein, Smf3p, appears to be exclusively intracellular, possibly in the Golgi. NRAMP2 (Slc11A2) of Homo sapiens (TC# 2.A.55.2.1) has a 12 TMS topology with intracellular N- and C-termini. Two-fold structural symmetry in the arrangement of membrane helices for TM1-5 and TM6-10 (conserved Slc2 hydrophobic core) is suggested. Transport reaction The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by NRAMP family proteins is: Internal rearrangements during DraNramp conformational changes Me2+ (out) + H+ (out) ‚áå Me2+ (in) + H+ (in).  Structure and Mechanism  All Nramp proteins have eleven to twelve transmembrane helices, the first ten of which form a canonical LeuT fold, common throughout the APC superfamily. Metal uptake in Nramp proteins is typically stimulated by acidic pH and accompanied by proton influx, although many homologs have also shown proton uniport. This has been explained in the Deinococcus radiodurans homolog as the result of spatially segregated metal and proton pathways that rely on a longer-range allosteric connection rather than the direct structural connection seen in canonical symporters. Metal uptake requires alternating access bulk conformation change, in which the protein changes from an outward- open state to an inward-open state upon metal binding, while proton uptake can occur through a simpler channel-like mechanism.

In 1901, he was one of several artists who illustrated a special edition of Dead Souls by Gogol, published by Adolf Marks. He also designed theater posters and a popular series of postcards depicting old Russia, published by Maison Lapine of Paris. After 1900, his popularity led him to try his hand at a wider variety of design projects. He created models for the Imperial Porcelain Factory and worked with the House of Faberg√©. In 1903, for the famous Ball in the Winter Palace, he consulted with experts and created sketches for elaborate historical costumes. Guests at the ball paid a fortune for them, as many were made with real jewelry. Later, a limited edition gift album with photographs of the participants was published, with \\"donations\\" benefitting Russian troops in the Far East.

Originally founded in 1894, the golf club is situated on the Belvedere estate located from Mullingar town. History The club was originally called the Westmeath Golf Club when it was founded in 1894, and the first members played on what is described as ‚Äúa small course‚Äù on the site of Mullingar Race Course. In 1903, the club moved to a nine-hole layout just north of Mullingar town and golf was only permitted in the winter months as the farmer who owned the land needed the use of it in the summer which resulted in a major drawback.http://www.mullingargolfclub.ie/history- story/1935-the-beginning/#prettyPhoto Land became available to the Golf Club at the beautiful Belvedere House Estate in 1934. The legendary golf course architect, James Braid, was hired to design and oversee the construction of the course at Belvedere, which was opened for play in 1937. The course has been upgraded over recent years and a new short game facility was opened for play in 2017. The signature hole is the par 3 second hole measuring 209 yards with an elevated green guarded on three sides by deep bunkers. Christy O'Connor (Snr) the legendary Irish golfer proclaimed it the best parkland par 3 in Ireland. Mullingar Golf Club has become synonymous with high quality golfers after the club members in 1963 organised a Scratch Cup competition. The Scratch Trophy competition is now accredited with the Bridgestone Points System, which has elevated its status as an Irish championship competition. From the outset, they were very ambitious and convinced the best amateurs in Ireland, Great Britain and Europe to compete in the competition. Past winners include Joe Carr, the inaugural winner, Darren Clarke, Paul McGinley, Padraig Harrington, Shane Lowry and Rory McIllroy. Mullingar Golf Club is a private members club. The club members volunteer to help manage the affairs of the club through participating in committees. The club employs full-time staff to manage the business and to maintain all the facilities. Visitors are always welcome. The club is an equal opportunity members club and employer.

The anomaly appears to give the plane of the Solar System and hence the location of Earth a greater significance than might be expected by chance ‚Äì a result which has been claimed to be evidence of a departure from the Copernican principle. The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation signature presents a direct large- scale view of the universe that can be used to identify whether our position or movement has any particular significance. There has been much publicity about analysis of results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck mission that show both expected and unexpected anisotropies in the CMB. The motion of the solar system, and the orientation of the plane of the ecliptic are aligned with features of the microwave sky, which on conventional thinking are caused by structure at the edge of the observable universe.CERN Courier \\"Does the motion of the solar system affect the microwave sky?\\" preprint Specifically, with respect to the ecliptic plane the \\"top half\\" of the CMB is slightly cooler than the \\"bottom half\\"; furthermore, the quadrupole and octupole axes are only a few degrees apart, and these axes are aligned with the top/bottom divide. Lawrence Krauss is quoted as follows in a 2006 Edge.org article: > But when you look at CMB map, you also see that the structure that is > observed, is in fact, in a weird way, correlated with the plane of the earth > around the sun. Is this Copernicus coming back to haunt us? That's crazy. > We're looking out at the whole universe. There's no way there should be a > correlation of structure with our motion of the earth around the sun ‚Äì the > plane of the earth around the sun ‚Äì the ecliptic. That would say we are > truly the center of the universe. Some anomalies in the background radiation have been reported which are aligned with the plane of the Solar System, which contradicts the Copernican principle by suggesting that the Solar System's alignment is special. Land and Magueijo in 2005 dubbed this alignment the \\"axis of evil\\" owing to the implications for current models of the cosmos, although several later studies have shown systematic errors in the collection of that data and the way it is processed. Various studies of the CMB anisotropy data either confirm the Copernican principle, model the alignments in a non-homogeneous universe still consistent with the principle, or attempt to explain them as local phenomena. Some of these alternate explanations were discussed by Copi, et al., who claimed that data from the Planck satellite could shed significant light on whether the preferred direction and alignments were spurious. Coincidence is a possible explanation. Chief scientist from WMAP, Charles L. Bennett suggested coincidence and human psychology were involved, \\"I do think there is a bit of a psychological effect, people want to find unusual things.\\" Data from the Planck Telescope published in 2013 has since found stronger evidence for the anisotropy. \\"For a long time, part of the community was hoping that this would go away, but it hasn‚Äôt,\\" says Dominik Schwarz of the University of Bielefeld in Germany. There is no consensus on the nature of this and other observed anomalies and their statistical significance is unclear. For example, a study that includes the Planck mission results shows how masking techniques could introduce errors that when taken into account can render several anomalies, including the Axis of Evil, not statistically significant. A 2016 study compared isotropic and anisotropic cosmological models against WMAP and Planck data and found no evidence for anisotropy. Cosmologist Edmund Schluessel has suggested that gravitational waves with extremely long wavelengths could explain the Axis of Evil. In June, 2020, the 'axis of evil' observation was confirmed by a study conducted by Lior Shamir, which verified the same result via a different measurement. Shamir commented: \\"We have two different sky surveys showing the exact same patterns, even when the galaxies are completely different. There is no error that can lead to that. This is the universe that we live in. This is our home.\\" See also   *  References  Category:Radio astronomy Category:Physical cosmology Category:Astronomical radio sources Category:Cosmic background radiation Category:Astrophysics Category:Inflation (cosmology) Category:Observational astronomy ","title":"Axis of evil (cosmology)"},{"id":"49293945","text":"The R475 road, known as the Kilrush Road, is a regional road in Ireland, located in central County Clare.http://www.sabre- roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=R475 References Category:Regional roads in the Republic of Ireland Category:Roads in County Clare ","title":"R475 road (Ireland)"},{"id":"49293952","text":"Gwendoline Noreen Chomba Konie (9 October 1938 ‚Äì 14 March 2009) was a Zambian poet, diplomat and politician.

Aircraft The Douglas DC-6 involved was built in 1947 with serial number 43063/60 and registration OO-SDB and was used by the Belgian airline company Sabena until its destruction in 1955.  Crash  Sabena Flight 503 was a Douglas DC-6 which departed from Brussels, Belgium at 17:17 GMT en route to Leopoldstad, Congo with stops at Rome-Ciampino, Italy and Kano, Nigeria under the command of pilot Stephan Stolz and co-pilot Patrick McNarama. The aircraft made contact with Ciampino International Airport according to plan at 19:29 GMT, at which time the aircraft had passed over Florence, Italy at 17500 feet. The weather conditions however kept getting worse with heavy rain and snow fall. At 19:48 Ciampino control asked the aircraft whether it had passed over Viterbo. Instead of answering this question directly, the crew inquired whether the Viterbo NDB (Non-directional beacon) was on full power. The controller replied that another aircraft had overflown Viterbo shortly before and had found it to be operating properly. At 19:51 GMT the aircraft stated that it had passed over Viterbo one minute previously and requested clearance to descend to 5500 feet which was granted. One minute later it inquired whether the Ciampino ILS were operating and received an affirmative reply. At 19:55 co-pilot McNamara contacted Ciampino and stated that the crew would prepare for the landing procedure but that the visibility had worsened; the connection was very weak due to the severe storm and heavy snow and rain fall. At 19:56 Flight 503 called Rome control for the last time when suddenly the communication was cut off. The aircraft had crashed somewhere in the mountains of Rieti, Italy North-East of Rome and was now missing. Sabena itself got notified about the missing aircraft that same night at 23:15 but would not make an official statement until the morning of the following day. = Rescue effort = The airplane had crashed somewhere in the mountains of Rieti, Italy North East of Rome which were known for being difficult to access and also lay in a nature reserve where wolves roamed. The Italians immediately started a search and rescue mission to locate the missing aircraft and rescue its occupants. They knew the harsh conditions in the mountains and if there were any survivors that they wouldn't last long on top of the freezing mountain. However, because the weather didn't clear, the searchers could only investigate the lower parts of the mountains. Two days after the disaster, Belgian investigators arrived in Rieti and helped their Italian colleagues to locate the crash site. On 16 February the weather finally cleared and helicopters could be used in the search, sadly nothing was found. In a last effort to locate the aircraft in time for anyone to survive, experts calculated how much fuel the aircraft had left and extrapolated the distance it could have traveled. Their calculations stated that the aircraft should be in a range from Ciampino. Finally after an 8-day search on 21 February 1955 at 10:15, the aircraft was located on Monte Terminillo at a site so remote it could only be reached the next day on 22 February after the rescue teams walked and climbed the mountain for over 2 hours. Monte Terminillo seen from the East When they finally reached the crash site, there was devastation. It was freezing and visibility was only , sometimes even less. The snow lay thick and hid part of the aircraft. The aircraft lay in big pieces in the snow and looked as if it had crashed nose down after hitting a number of trees on the mountain side. Only the tail of the aircraft aft of the rear door was relatively intact. The engines had been torn off and only 2 of the 4 were ever found, one of them had clearly hit the trees because there were tree branches stuck in it. The forward section of the fuselage was shredded and the wings were completely destroyed as well, torn main-wheel covers indicated that the landing gear was extended when the aircraft hit the trees and seconds later the mountain. The first bodies were found shortly after, completely frozen. One of the victims even had a four of diamonds card in his hand. The rest of the bodies were found in or near the aircraft and it became clear that there were no survivors. It however became clear after autopsies and other evidence that everyone had died on impact. All bodies were recovered by 25 February 1955 and transported to a temporary morgue in the church of San Antonio in Rieti. Investigation After determining the angle of impact with the mountain, it was discovered that Flight 503 was 150¬∞ off course. After investigators calculated the flight path, the final moments of Flight 503 could be reconstructed from the moment it passed Viterbo. A number of watches found standing still at the crash site together with the radio messages and the speed of the aircraft, investigators could make a clear image of Flight 503's flight path. It shows that the pilots kept following their flight schedules and kept flying in a straight line. However the crew never noticed that the bad weather and the wind that was blowing from the West had blown the aircraft off course and straight to the mountain range. On certain points in the Italian mountains the wind can be so strong that the aircraft was blown on a different course and that the radio-navigation tools on the medium wave couldn't offer the usual assistance which also explained the weak radio signals. In the end, the severe storm together with faulty navigation and a crew which were unfamiliar to the terrain proved to be fatal and send Flight 503 on a direct collision course with the mountain range without anyone realising it.  Aftermath  Marcella Mariani was one of the victims Most of the aircraft was left on the mountain since constant changing weather cycles made it nearly impossible to retrieve the debris, most of it has now been washed away into deeper parts of the mountain range. 28 of the 29 bodies were taken back to Belgium for burial. Amongst the victims was Miss Italia Marcella Mariani who was buried in Rome, Italy, her intended destination. Family of the victims placed a cross supported by rocks in 1964 on the crash site in remembrance of those lost on that stormy night in 1955. A new monument depicting the intact tail section was unveiled on the crash site in 2010.

History Grecian, a fine barque, of 518 tons, sailed from The Downs bound for South Australia on 15 June 1850, almost exactly one year after her first such voyage. The trip was uneventful and she arrived in Gulf St Vincent on Sunday, 13 October, and made the light ship at about 4 pm. The weather was very stormy, with the wind blowing a full gale from the west-north-west. Grecian was anchored in apparent safety riding with a single anchor, with 65 fathoms () chain, and the passengers were served their dinner. At about 5:30, the gale increasing, another 75 fathoms were added to the anchor chain. About 7 pm, the gale still increasing, and the ship driving rapidly towards the shore, the second anchor was let go. Despite the two anchors, of 70 and 90 cwt. (3.5 and 4.5 tonnes), the ship continued driving until 9 pm, when she struck the beach. The rudder and sternpost were knocked away, carrying away part of the poop and after-cabin. It was then deemed prudent to slip one anchor. The striking of the vessel, continued, when the remaining anchor was slipped, and she broached broadside on, the sea breaking over her fore and aft, to the terror of the passengers. Captain \\"Magnificent George\\" Hyde, the master of the vessel, ordered the release of the longboat, and got the passengers into the longboat, and the officers and crew into the lifeboat. The captain, carpenter, and third officer remained with the ship. One passenger, Mr. Leslie, a brother of Mrs. Giles, of Port Adelaide, was somehow unable to make it to the boats and was presumed drowned. With all hope for the ship gone, the captain left in the jolly boat, and found the longboat onshore at the point. He then took charge of the lifeboat and landed the ladies on Torrens Island, where, from 6 am. to 3 pm., they were without food or shelter. With much difficulty the captain readied the ship Digby, and returned with provisions for the passengers. The steam tug soon arrived, and most of the passengers were conveyed to the Port. The remainder landed on the beach, some at Port Gawler, and reached Port Adelaide later. The next day, Grecian was found to be on her beam endsOn her beam-ends: (nautical) heeled over so far that the deck is practically vertical and broken up, beyond repair. The passengers were:‚Äî Mrs. George Hyde, Mrs. Sarah Wigley, Miss Maria C. Wigley, Nathaniel A. Knox, Anne Jane Knox, Miss Henrietta Knox, Miss Sydney Knox (who married John Acraman), Nathaniel Knox, jnr., William Knox, Rose Mahony, Dr. Brendt, Richard Box, jnr., Charles J. Anstey, Thomas Fowler and Mrs. Fowler and her two children, and Mr. Leslie. The officers and crew numbered 25 in all. The Grecian and her cargo were estimated to be worth at least ¬£80,000 (around AUD 50 million today). Postscript Two old-fashioned cannon of similar design were, eight years apart, found at the entrance to the Port, and believed to have belonged to Grecian.

Museo de Historia de Madrid. The Noviciado de la Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s (Spanish for: Novitiate of the Society of Jesus), was once the largest church in Madrid. It was located on Calle Ancha de San Bernardo, where currently stands the mansion of the former Central University, now called Complutense University of Madrid. The church, in the Baroque style, was founded on April 15, 1602, based on an initiative of Ana F√©lix de Guzm√°n (1560-1612) Marquise of Camarasa. Placed under the patronage of Saint Ignatius confessor of Loyola, its plant was a Latin cross, with a transept of good size. The exterior of the main facade consisted of a central body flanked by two towers. On the central body was placed a shield with the Royal arms carved by Felipe de Castro. Attached to the church, and toward the Calle de los Reyes, stood the rest of the complex, which was not built until mid-century. In 1767, the Jesuits were expelled and the Casa del Noviciado was ceded by the king to the Venerable Congregation of Priests Missionaries of the Savior of the world, taking the name of the Oratorio de los Padres del Salvador del Mundo. Today, little of the Novitiate House remains. The perimeter walls of the church survive, used for building the paraninfo of the university. The rest of the complex is preserved in two ancient cloisters, converted into courtyards, around which the various offices and classrooms are distributed. History =Early history and construction= Iglesia de Montserrat to the right and the Oratorio de los Padres del Salvador del Mundo to the left (engraving by James B. Allen, based on an original drawing of the painter David Roberts, made during his trip to Spain in 1832-33). The Noviciado de la Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s was founded on April 15, 1602, based on an initiative of Ana F√©lix de Guzm√°n (1560-1612) Marquise of Camarasa. This made available to the Jesuits some land recently acquired, occupied almost all of the block between the present calles de San Bernardo, Noviciado, Amaniel and Reyes. On this farm it had been the Embassy of Genoa, which had been abandoned in 1601, after the brief moving of the Court from Madrid to Valladolid, by decision of Philip III (d. 1598-1621). In 1605 began the construction of the church, which occupied the northern end of the property. Attached to it and toward the Calle de los Reyes, stood the rest of the complex, although its works could not begin until mid-century. Of the building, the most notable was the church, built around 1606 according to the plans of Jesuit architect Pedro S√°nchez, who had also made the Iglesia del Colegio Imperial. Placed under the patronage of Saint Ignatius confessor of Loyola, its plant was a Latin cross, with a transept and dome of good size. Outside the main facade was interesting, it consisted of a central body flanked by two towers. On the central body, was placed a shield with the Royal arms carved by Felipe de Castro. =Expulsion and return of the Jesuits= In 1767, the Jesuits were expelled by Charles III (d. 1759-1788). The Casa del Noviciado was ceded by the king to the Venerable Congregation of Priests Missionaries of the Savior of the world. With the change of ownership, the church took the name of the Oratorio de los Padres del Salvador del Mundo. During the reign of Ferdinand VII (d. 1813-1833), around 1829, the Jesuits managed to return to the facility, but could only stay there until 1836, when there was the confiscation of Mendiz√°bal. =Use as home of the Central University= After being used as a barracks for military engineers, in 1843 the old building of the novitiate became house the Central University, which was none other than the Complutense University, In fact, it was not tried to found a new university in Madrid, but to move from Alcal√° de Henares the old Complutense University . The transfer / move was confirmed by order of Queen Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies on October 29, 1836.\\"MADRID BARROCO (1600 - 1725)\\" Madrid Hist√≥rico That same year was demolished the original facade and work began remodeling the building, under the direction of Francisco Javier Mari√°tegui (1775-1844), for use as an academic center. After his death, Narciso Pascual y Colomer (1801-1870) took over the work, starting a new project, of a classical nature, signed in 1847. Current status Paraninfo of the Complutense University of Madrid, work by Narciso Pascual y Colomer. Little of the Novitiate House remains. The perimeter walls of the Church survive, used for building the paraninfo of the university, although its original plan in a Latin cross was transformed into a huge ellipse, similar to it of the Spanish Senate. Of the rest of the complex are preserved the spaces of the two ancient cloisters, converted into courtyards, around which the various offices and classrooms are distributed. The huge building of the former Central University has many uses today. Its northern part, where is the paraninfo (auditorium), still linked to the Complutense University. In the southwestern corner is the Instituto Cardenal Cisneros, while the rest of the complex depends of the Ministry of Education and Science.

The Democratic Party held its own Iowa caucuses on the same day. Ted Cruz was able to defeat Donald Trump in the Iowa Caucus by winning over evangelical and libertarian caucus-goers; Cruz won 51,666 caucus votes or 27.6%, giving him a net gain of one delegate over Trump. Mike Huckabee, the 2008 Iowa Caucus winner, dropped out following a poor performance in the caucus. While Cruz had the endorsement of Congressman Steve King of the 4th Congressional District in rural northwest Iowa, and was able to consolidate devout Evangelical support in the Sioux City area, he was snubbed by Terry Branstad, the popular Republican Governor at the time. Trump tried to make a run among the majority-Catholic mill towns of Mississippi River valley, but Cruz's religious support was stronger than most polls anticipated.

Biography Stankova was born in Ruse, People's Republic of Bulgaria. She began attending the Ruse math circle as a fifth grader in Bulgaria, the same year she learned to solve the Rubik's Cube and began winning regional mathematics competitions. She later wrote of this experience that \\"if I was not a member of Ruse SMC I would not be able to make such profound achievements in mathematics\\".. She became a student at an elite English- language high school, and competed on the Bulgarian team in the International Mathematical Olympiads in 1987 and 1988, earning silver medals both times.. She entered Sofia University but in 1989, as the Iron Curtain was falling, became one of 15 Bulgarian students selected to travel to the US to complete their studies.. Stankova studied at Bryn Mawr College, completing bachelor's and master's degrees there in 1992,. with Rhonda Hughes as a faculty mentor. While an undergraduate, she participated in a summer research program with Joseph Gallian at the University of Minnesota Duluth, which began her interest in permutation patterns. Next, she went to Harvard University for her doctoral studies, and earned a Ph.D. there in 1997; her dissertation, entitled Moduli of Trigonal Curves, was supervised by Joe Harris. She worked at the University of California, Berkeley as Morrey Assistant Professor of Mathematics before joining the Mills College faculty in 1999, and continues to teach one course per year as a visiting professor at Berkeley... She also serves on the advisory board of the Proof School in San Francisco. Contributions In the theory of permutation patterns, Stankova is known for proving that the permutations with the forbidden pattern 1342 are equinumerous with the permutations with forbidden pattern 2413, an important step in the enumeration of permutations avoiding a pattern of length 4.. In 1998 she became the founder and director of the Berkeley Math Circle, an after-school mathematics enrichment program that Stankova modeled after her early experiences learning mathematics in Bulgaria... The Berkeley circle was only the second math circle in the US (after one in Boston); following its success, over 100 other circles have been created, and Stankova has assisted in the formation of many of them. Also in 1998, she founded the Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad.. For six years, she served as a coach of the US International Mathematical Olympiad team.. Since 2013, she has featured in several videos on the mathematics-themed YouTube channel \\"Numberphile\\". Publications With Tom Rike, she is co- editor of two books about her work with the Berkeley Math Circle, A Decade of the Berkeley Math Circle: The American Experience (Vol. I, 2008, Vol. II, 2014).. Awards and honors In 1992, Stankova won the Alice T. Schafer Prize of the Association for Women in Mathematics for her undergraduate research in permutation patterns.. In 2004 she became one of two inaugural winners of the Henry L. Alder Award for Distinguished Teaching by a Beginning College or University Mathematics Faculty Member. In 2011 Stankova won the Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching, given by the Mathematical Association of America, \\"for her outstanding work in teaching, mentoring, and inspiring students at all levels, and in leading the development of Math Circles, and promoting participation in mathematics competitions\\".. From 2009 to 2012 she was the Frederick A. Rice Professor of Mathematics at Mills.

CRIStin documents all scholarly publications by Norwegian researchers, and complements the BIBSYS database, which focuses on books. CRIStin is the first database of its kind worldwide.All forskning i √©n kurv , Universitetsavisa, 23 November 2010 The CRIStin system includes the Norwegian Scientific Index, a comprehensive bibliographic database aimed at covering and rating all serious academic publication channels worldwide, including academic journals and publishers. The Norwegian Scientific Index is also used in other countries than Norway, e.g. in South Africa. It also serves as the basis for a joint Nordic bibliographic database that is being developed under the auspices of the Nordic governments and the Nordic Council. Additionally the European database ERIH PLUS is now a sister project of the Norwegian Scientific Index, after it was transferred from the European Science Foundation to the Norwegian Centre for Research Data in 2014. History The CRIStin system traces its roots to the research documentation system of the University of Oslo, that was developed during the 1990s and known as Forskningsdokumentasjon ved Universitetet i Oslo (\\"Research Documentation at the University of Oslo\\"), abbreviated ForskDok. Until 2010/2011 Norway had two competing research documentation databases. Almost all colleges and universities used the BIBSYS FORSKDOK database, that was developed from 1991 as part of the national BIBSYS system, itself established in 1972. However, the University of Oslo, the country's preeminent university, chose to develop its own and similarly named system. In 2004 the research documentation system of the University of Oslo formed the basis for a joint system, renamed Frida, for the University of Oslo and the then three other Norwegian universities, but excluding the country's many colleges and other research institutions. In 2010 Frida was transferred to the government and became a national research documentation system, and was renamed CRIStin. The BIBSYS FORSKDOK database was then closed in 2011.  Norwegian Scientific Index  { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" + Ratings in the Norwegian Scientific Index ! Rating ! Explanation - ! Level 2  The highest rating, reserved for the internationally most prestigious publication channels (journals and publishers). A maximum of 20% of (serious) publication channels in a given discipline may be given this rating. Generates substantially increased funding. - ! Level 1  The standard rating, which designates publication channels (journals and publishers) as academic. Intended to cover at least 80% of (serious) publication channels in a given discipline. Generates funding. - ! Level 0  The lowest rating, which designates publication channels (journals and publishers) as non-academic. Generates no funding. - ! Level X (announced 2020)  A rating reserved for questionable publishers, including those suspected of being predatory. Generates no funding. } The Norwegian Scientific Index (Norwegian: Norsk vitenskapsindeks, NVI) is a comprehensive Norwegian bibliographic database established by the Norwegian government, aimed at covering all academic publication channels worldwide, i.e. academic journals, series with ISSN and scholarly presses. It is operated by the government-owned company Norwegian Centre for Research Data on behalf of the Royal Ministry of Education and Research, and forms one of the key parts that together make up the CRIStin system. The index divides journals and publishers considered to meet academic quality criteria (including peer review) into \\"level 1\\" and \\"level 2.\\" Level 1 is the standard rating for publication channels considered to meet academic quality criteria, and is intended to cover at least 80% of all serious journals and publishers in a given discipline. Level 2 is the highest rating and is reserved for the internationallyWith some exceptions for strongly nationally oriented disciplines, such as law and (Norwegian) history, where Level 2 status is given to the leading journals within Scandinavia most prestigious journals and publishers within the discipline. \\"Level 2\\" status is granted by national expert committees for each discipline, and may be given to a maximum of 20% of all publication channels in a given discipline. Funding of research institutions in Norway is partially tied to the Norwegian Scientific Index, and only recognised \\"level 1\\" or \\"level 2\\" publications generate funding. \\"Level 2\\" publications generate significantly increased funding compared to \\"level 1\\" publications.OECD Science, Technology and Industry Outlook 2010, p. 122 Journals and publishers that are designated as not academic are identified as \\"level 0,\\" which means that they don't count in the official academic career system or public funding of research institutions. The \\"0\\" rating may imply that the publication channel lacks adequate peer review or that it in some other way doesn't meet basic quality standards for academic journals, that it is a trade journal with no academic aspirations or some other form of entirely non-academic publication, or that it is it is regarded as predatory. Such publication channels are not systematically included in the index, and the rating may, but doesn't necessarily, indicate that the publication channel was nominated for \\"level 1\\" status and failed to be approved as such, or that it has been downgraded from \\"level 1\\" status e.g. due to predatory publishing practices. Some Norwegian publications are included in the database and identified as level 0 mainly for legacy reasons, that is, they were included in the database's predecessors before the rating system was invented; they include a number of trade journals, newspapers and other non-academic publications. The National Publication Committee has announced that Norway will introduce a new \\"level X\\" for questionable publishers in 2020. Level X publications will not generate funding. The Norwegian Scientific Index is also used in other countries than Norway, both formally and informally. For example, South Africa started using the index in 2016. The Norwegian Scientific Index also forms the basis for the Nordic List, a joint Nordic bibliographic database that is developed under the auspices of the Nordic Council and the governments of the Nordic countries.

It is a dense shrub with many tangled branches, densely hairy stems, leaves and sepals and red or yellow petals. Description Eremophila hillii is a dense, sometimes erect, others spreading shrub with many tangled branches and which grows to a height of less than . Its branches are densely covered with white or pale grey branched hairs, at least when young but become glabrous as they age. The leaves are densely crowded near the tips of the branches and are covered with a dense layer of branched hairs when young, becoming glabrous as they age. They are mostly long, wide, egg-shaped to almost circular and usually have a few rounded teeth on the margins. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a densely hairy stalk long. There are 5 sepals, differing in size and from each other, linear to egg-shaped and mostly long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is red or orange-red, sometimes yellow and both the inside and outside of the tube have scattered glandular hairs. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs from July to September and is followed by fruits which are dry, oval-shaped with a glabrous, papery covering and are long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1967 by Elizabeth Anne Shaw and the description was published in Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (hillii) honours \\"Ronald Hill of the Adelaide Botanic Garden\\". Distribution and habitat E. hillii grows in stony clay and calcareous soils in isolated populations growing on the Nullarbour Plain in South Australia and Western Australia. Conservation status Eremophila hillii is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. Use in horticulture Hill's emubush is a hardy and reliable shrub and some specimens have been in cultivation for up to 40 years. The bright red and orange-yellow forms make an attractive contrast when planted together. It can be propagated easily from cuttings and grown in a wide range of soils, including clay although it prefers a sunny aspect. It is both drought tolerant and frost resistant.

She was the wife of slave rebel, Nat Turner.  Early life  In the year 1807, Cherry was believed to be about 11 years old. She was older than Nat. Cherry lived at the Turner's plantation from about 1807 to 1823. = Marriage and children = It is largely speculated that Nat and Cherry met and were married at Samuel Turner's plantation in the early 1820s, although historians still dispute who exactly Nat Turner's wife was. Furthering the issue, claims about Nat Turner are difficult to verify. It is widely believed that Cherry did have children, but it is undetermined how many. Historians vary anywhere between believing she had 1 to 3 children. The most widely held belief is that the pair had 2 or 3 children - 1 daughter and 1 or 2 sons. Historians believe one of their children was a slave boy named Riddick. = Giles Reese Plantation = After Samuel Turner died in 1823, Cherry and Nat were separated. Nat was sold to Thomas Moore. while Cherry and her children were sold to Giles Reese.  Nat Turner's Rebellion  During Nat Turner's rebellion, the rebels avoided Giles Reese plantation, even though it was in route, likely because Nat wanted to keep Cherry and the children safe. Regardless, while authorities were in search of Nat, they went looking for Cherry as well.

In 2005, the area was renamed Chinese Massacre Cove, and a memorial was placed there in 2012 in three languages, Chinese, English, and Nez Perce. Massacre Two groups of Chinese miners, led by Chea Po and Lee She, departed Lewiston in October 1886 and headed upriver along the Snake into Oregon's Hells Canyon to search for gold. Chea's group stopped on the Oregon side of the Snake, near Robinson Gulch and the cove where Deep Creek empties into the Snake. Lee's group continued upriver to Salt Creek. Chea Po had chosen a location just upstream of Dug Bar, a ford used by horse and cattle thieves to cross the Snake. Dug Bar was named for Thomas J. Douglas, a thief who had used the area to graze his horses. Douglas was killed in 1883, and a gang led by Bruce Evans, known locally as \\"Old Blue\\", began using Douglas's abandoned cabin in the spring of 1887, approximately downstream from Chea Po's camp. The gang consisted of Evans, J.T. (\\"Tigh\\") Canfield, C.O. (Homer) LaRue, Frank Vaughn, Carl (or Hezekiah) Hughes, Hiram Maynard and Robert McMillan, a fifteen-year-old boy. In late May 1887 (May 25, according to Stratton) the gang of seven white horse gang members robbed, murdered, and mutilated between 10 and 34 Chinese employees of the Sam Yup Company, reportedly for their gold. Estimates of the value of gold stolen range from $4,000 to $50,000. According to a contemporaneous news article, the gold dust was given to Canfield for safekeeping, but he double-crossed the rest of the gang and fled the county. Robert McMillan made a deathbed confession to his father Hugh recounting details of the massacre, which were published in 1891. According to Hugh McMillan, the Chinese miners were ambushed by a party consisting of Robert McMillan, Bruce Evans, J.T. Canfield, Max Larue, and Frank Vaughn in late April 1887. Hiram Maynard and Carl Hughes were traveling with the others, but did not participate in the ambush. Canfield and Larue first attacked the camp of thirteen Chinese from the bluffs overlooking the cove, driving them towards Evans and Vaughn, who were in the path of their retreat. Twelve Chinese were killed in the initial fusillade, then the remaining man had \\"his brains beaten out\\", retrieving $5,500 in gold dust. The next day, eight more Chinese returned to the camp by boat, where the gang shot and killed them, throwing the 21 bodies into the Snake River. The gang then stole the boat and traveled to the next Chinese camp, where they killed 13 more and retrieved $50,000 in gold. Hugh McMillan stated that Robert was only present for the first day's events, but the gang had discussed the next day's plans before Robert left the others. According to a modern account, Vaughn stayed behind to prepare dinner while the other six rode to ambush the miners. McMillan minded the horses; Canfield and LaRue shot from the rim of Robinson Gulch, while Evans shot from the river level; Hughes and Maynard were positioned upstream and downstream to catch any miner who tried to flee along the river. Their surprise attack was successful, and all ten of the miners at the camp were killed, the last with a rock after the gang had run out of ammunition. The remainder of the modern account agrees with McMillan's deathbed confession: the gang returned to the Douglas cabin and restocked their ammunition; then on next day, Evans, Canfield, and LaRue ambushed a group of eight Chinese miners who returned to the cove, and finally sailed to a second camp, where they killed thirteen more miners. =Aftermath= The bodies of some murder victims began washing ashore soon afterward, swept downstream to places as far away as Lime Point (south of the mouth of the Grande Ronde River), Log Cabin Island (now the site of the Lower Granite Dam), and Penawawa, Washington. Each body bore unmistakable markings of great violence; J.K. Vincent, a federal official who investigated the crime, later wrote \\"every one was shot, cut up and stripped and thrown in the River.\\" Lee She's group went to visit Chea Po's group at Robinson Gulch in early June 1887, and found three bodies in the deserted, ransacked camp; they fled in terror to Lewiston, where they reported the crimes. A news article published in July 1887 called the corpses a \\"severe warning to Chinese miners\\" and blamed the victims: \\"More than likely it was the whites who look with an evil eye upon Chinese intrusion in American mines. The American miner kicks hard at the Chinese miner.\\" Other local Chinese Americans believed that all Chinese miners along the Snake had been killed once the mutilated bodies began to surface. Initially, \\"a thorough investigation\\" described in a July 17, 1887 article concluded the Chinese had been murdered by rival Chinese miners, since the victims had been \\"shot in the back and mutilated by cleavers, a weapon in general use by the Chinese.\\" George S. Craig owned the Douglas cabin and discovered numerous skeletons in the area when he returned to winter his stock in the fall of 1887. Frank Vaughn confessed to the crime in 1888 and his testimony led to the indictment of the other six gang members on March 23, 1888. In follow-up testimony given on April 16, Vaughn blamed Evans, Canfield, and LaRue for the massacre, and said that he, Hughes, Maynard, and McMillan had not participated. Vaughn himself was arrested on April 18. By the time he was arrested, almost the entire gang had left America, save Vaughn and Hughes. Three of the gang (Maynard, McMillan, and Hughes) were brought to trial but none were convicted. The trio were arraigned on August 28, 1888, and pleaded not guilty on August 29. Their testimony was consistent with Vaughn's, namely, that blame for the crime fell squarely on Evans, Canfield, and LaRue, all absent. The jury found the three men innocent on September 1, 1888, following a short trial. * J.T. Canfield was imprisoned in Kansas for stealing mules and returned to Wallowa County to search for gold after his release. He was noted to be in the area during the trial, and moved to Texas before settling in Idaho and opening a blacksmith shop as Charley Canfield. * Bruce Evans was arrested within a week of the massacre on an unrelated rustling charge. He escaped from custody two weeks later, possibly with the help of Hughes and Vaughn. When he fled, he left two children and his wife behind. His name is engraved on a memorial arch in the courthouse square of Enterprise, Oregon, honoring the early pioneers of the county. * C.O. LaRue was rumored to have died in a dispute over a card game in California. * Robert McMillan died of diphtheria in 1888 at the age of 16. Legacy In 1995, Charlotte McIver discovered a cache of documents relating to the 1888 trial in an old safe being donated to the Wallowa County Museum. When the news came to the attention of R. Gregory Nokes, a reporter for The Oregonian, he began his own research into the massacre, going on to publish a journal article in 2006 and a nonfiction book in 2009 after his retirement in 2003 allowed him to conduct research full-time. The five acre site was named Chinese Massacre Cove in 2005 over the objections of Wallowa County commissioners. The Chinese Massacre Memorial Committee placed a granite monument measuring in May 2012, engraved with the words \\"Chinese Massacre Cove. Site of the 1887 massacre of as many as 34 Chinese gold miners. No one was held accountable\\" written in English, Chinese, and Nez Perce. It was dedicated on June 22, 2012. Deep Creek, a fictionalized account of the massacre and its aftermath written by William Howarth and Anne Matthews under the pen name \\"Dana Hand\\", was selected by The Washington Post as one of the best novels of 2010. Two episodes of the television show Ghost Mine, first aired in October 2013, covered the investigation of paranormal activity at Chinese Massacre Cove. Peter Ludwin wrote and published a collection of poetry in 2016, Gone to Gold Mountain. He states he was inspired after reading Massacred for Gold, the 2009 book by R. Gregory Nokes.

Produced by PCTV, it premiered in 1984 on Sesame!. It later aired as Batibot in 1985. The show concluded in 2013. History =Conception and the first Batibot= Batibot was conceptualized and produced by Feny Bautista, a teacher from the Community of Learners Foundation and writer Rene Villanueva. The show was inspired by the American children's show, Sesame Street which educates preschoolers through dance, song, and role-play educational skills through them. First aired in 1984, Batibot debuted as Sesame!. It stars Pong Pagong and Kiko Matsing which the characters were based on one of the Filipino stories, The Monkey and the Turtle popularized by Jos√© Rizal. In the first year of its airing, the children's show was co-produced by the Philippine Children's Television Foundation and Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) with the support of then First Lady Imelda Marcos. Government support did not last long, ended within 1984 and the co-production deal was cancelled. The Philippine producers went on to produce a show based on Sesame Street in February 1985. Batibot was then done wholly in Filipino and featured stories in a Philippine context. Airing on weekdays with a time slot of 10:30 AM, the series consistently ranked in 1985 among the top 10 daytime shows in the Philippines, outdoing its performance in 1984 when it was still a co- produced series and wholly American produced Sesame Street which first aired in the country in 1970. By February 1989, Batibot was airing its sixth season. However the producers of the series were experiencing financial constraints which placed uncertainty regarding the future airing of the show. Batibot was first aired in RPN and ABS-CBN, then it was later aired by PTV and GMA. In 1999, Batibot was relaunched as \\"Batang Batibot\\" airing on a Saturday morning timeslot. \\"Batibot\\" ceased airing in 2003.[Episode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxDhvAlnkHU] on Batibot by Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho, 2007 =TV5's Batibot (2010‚Äì2013)= TV5 announced in 2010 that it would revive the Batibot series that first aired in the 1980s.

Instead of a Monday‚ÄìFriday broadcast format, the new series was aired on Saturday at 8:30 a.m. The airing of the series lasted until 2013.

Stedman was the 2nd Superintendent of the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York.Cruikshank, J. L. and Kline, C.G. A History of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point in Peace and War ¬© 2008 Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., p. 446 The son of an Ireland born stonecutter, who worked in Quincy, Massachusetts' granite quarries, Stedman enlisted in the United States Coast Guard in 1917 at the age of 20. He was assigned to the USCGC Ossipee (WPR-50). At outbreak of WWI, the ship and its crew were transferred to the US Navy and saw overseas action. Stedman was awarded the World War I Victory Medal for his service. In 1919, he was commissioned an ensign in the United States Naval Reserve. Stedman, thereafter, entered the merchant marine, licensed as a ship's Third mate or 3rd officer. First rescue at sea and acts of seagoing heroism In 1925, while serving as the First officer of the passenger liner SS Harding, in raging seas and at great personal risk, Stedman commanded the lifeboat that accomplished the near impossible task of rescuing the entire crew of the sinking Italian cargo ship Ignazio Florio. Stedman received civilian medals from the governments of Italy, the United States and from the Lifesaving Benevolent Association for his actions, and a ticker tape parade through New York City honored the entire crew of the Harding. Second rescue at sea and award of the Navy Cross Capt. Giles C. Stedman (with binoculars) and 20 of the 22 lives that he saved from drowning on the sinking British freighter SS Exeter City While serving as Master (naval) of the SS American Merchant in 1933, in impossibly violent seas, Stedman effected the rescue of the entire crew of the sinking British merchant steamer SS Exeter City, save its captain and 3 of its crew, who had already been swept overboard in the gale before the American Merchant arrived on the scene. Together We Served With the American Merchant still 15 miles away and the distressed Exeter City at Longitude 39.3 West and Latitude 47.27 North about 650 miles out at sea off the coast of St. John's, Newfoundland, some third of the way between there and the tip of Ireland, the Exeter City radioed that its \\"No. 2 hatch\\" was already \\"stove-in, its life boats gone, and its bridge damaged.\\"Staff, Uniontown, Pennsylvania Evening Standard January 20, 1933, p. 2 With the seas too torrent to hazard a lifeboat rescue, Stedman had the American Merchant circle the Exeter City while discharging heavy oil to calm the adjacent sea (oil, while not as dense and floating on water, is more viscous). He then fired a line 400 yards to the rapidly sinking freighter. The line was used to pull a lifeboat from the American Merchant to the Exeter City. After the crew of the Exeter City boarded the lifeboat, they were pulled to safety by Stedman's crew. For this amazing feat of rescue, US Navy reservist Giles C. Stedman was awarded the Navy Cross. He also received a silver plaque from the government of Great Britain, the keys to the City of Boston, Massachusetts, and a medal of valor from the City of New York. When Stedman later wrote an article on methods of rescue at sea, it was considered such a technical milestone and so advanced procedures for rescues at sea of the day that Mount St. Mary's University (then, college) awarded Stedman the degree of D.Litt. (honoris causa) and Colgate University awarded him a D.Sc. degree (honoris causa). A second of Stedman's articles on sea rescue was published in the United States Naval Institute Proceedings in 1935. Third seagoing rescue While mastering the SS Washington, Stedman rescued the entire crew of the British freighter Olive Grove when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat off the Irish coast in 1939. By age 43, Stedman held the merchant rank of Commodore. WWII activation, final and greatest rescue operation, and death In 1941, reservist Stedman was activated into the US Navy at the US Navy rank of commander and made executive officer of the United States Navy troop transport USS West Point (AP-23) (former ocean liner SS America (1939)). In 1942, as then British Singapore was about to be overrun by Imperial Japanese forces and while under heavy air attack, the crew of the USS West Point rescued over 2000 British refugees from Singapore, many women and children. During the war, the US Navy promoted Stedman first to the rank of captain and then to rear admiral and appointed him first Commandant of Cadets and then Superintendent at the United States Merchant Marine Academy. He served as the academy's superintendent from 1943 to 1946. Stedman died of a cerebral hemorrhage at his home in London, England, in 1961.

Born in Liverpool, England and migrated to Sydney, Australia with his mother and father in early 1962. He is best known as Johnny Dole, lead singer and one of the founding members of the Sydney Punk Rock band Johnny Dole & The Scabs (1977-78). Early life Growing up in the Sydney suburb of Marrickville and coming from a family with a background in entertainment including his grandmother, Elsie Brown who was a vaudevillian style banjo player/entertainer and his father who was also a singer and dancer it was inevitable Walsh would follow in their footsteps. His mother Betty, affectionately known as \\"Vicki\\" would take him to many talent quests encouraging him to be as good as he could and his singing was improving all the time. By the age of 14 Walsh had sent away for his first ‚Äúmail order‚Äù guitar from the Melody School of Music. Enlisting the services of guitar teacher Lynton Bridge of Campsie and with lots of hard work he was soon playing like a pro. The 70s Eddy Holly and Sirikit - Stagecoach Tavern King Street, Sydney, circa 1974 During the early 70s Walsh sang and performed in many Sydney bands including, Eddy Halley & The Starliters featuring Tony Haley. On Walsh's suggestion they changed their name to Eddy Holly and Sirikit. They were a 50s revival band doing recreations of 50s artists such as Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran, who were some of Walsh's heroes. During his time with Eddy Holly and Sirikit he was using the stage name Mike Walsh, to cash in on the TV host of the same name. In 1975 he formed The Strays who would slowly morph into Johnny Dole & The Scabs by 1977. With Punk Rock quickly emerging from overseas The Strays realised they were in fact a Punk Rock band. Needing a new name to go along with this new form of music Walsh took on the surname Dole (an Australian slang word for unemployment payments from the government) which was something any good Punk Rocker should be on. Johnny is a very typical name from the 50s era, there were many Rockers using the name Johnny, one being Johnny O'Keefe another of his idols so Johnny Dole was born. Return To England After the breakup of Johnny Dole & The Scabs in 1978 he returned to England where the Punk scene was in full swing in the hope of forming a new band, The Crooked Hearts with Bob Short ex Filth bass player and Peter Mullany ex Johnny Dole & The Scabs guitarist but his increasing use of drugs was becoming a problem and The Crooked Hearts soon disbanded. Mullany himself would soon return to Australia and form the band Sekret Sekret with friends David Virgin and Dan Rumor who would then go on to form The Cruel Sea with Tex Perkins. Death Switchblade, circa 1983 Walsh returned to Australia in 1979 and formed a number of short lived bands, including The Shakers and Switchblade. But by 1983 his drug use was now out of control and he could no longer perform. With a continuing decline in his health he died alone in a rented room in Darlinghurst where his body was not found for five or six days after he had died 9 August 1987, aged 33, official cause of death, accidental overdose.

The 2016 El Protector was the fifth annual event produced under that name and the third to be held in January. The focal point of the show was the El Protector tag team tournament where eight teams composed of a \\"rookie\\" and a \\"vet\\" team up to compete for a trophy. The 2016 El Protector was won by Herodes Jr. and Atomic Star. Production =Background= Lucha Libre has a tradition for a tournament where a rookie, or novato, would be teamed up with an experienced veteran wrestler for a tag team tournament in the hopes of giving the Novato a chance to show case their talent and move up the ranks. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre has held a Torneo Gran Alternativa (\\"Great Alternative Tournament\\") almost every year since 1994, but the concept predates the creation of the Gran Alternativa. The Mexican professional wrestling company International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; at times referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Mexico) started their own annual rookie/veteran tournament in 2010. The first two tournaments were called Torneo Relampago de Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas de la Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"Projecting a new promise lightning tournament\\") but would be renamed the El Protector tournament in 2012. The El Protector shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2016 El Protector show was the seventh time that IWRG promoted a show around the rookie/veteran tournament, with the name changing to El Protector in 2012 and onwards. =Storylines= The event featured 11 professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

After gaining her freedom, Dubois moved to New Jersey where she lived with her children until her death. A physician by the name of C.W. Larison decided to document the life of Dubois and her journey to freedom in the book Silvia Dubois (Now 116 Yers Old) A Biografy of the Slav who Whipt Her Mistres and Gand Her Fredom. Early life as an enslaved woman Dubois was born in Sourland Mountain, New Jersey, although the exact year is contested. Dubois herself said she was born March 5, 1768. However, historian Jared C Lobdell dates the year of her birth to be 1788 or 1789. Her parents were Cuffy Baird, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, and Dorcas Compton. Her father, Baird, had a different owner than Dubois and her mother. Dorcas Compton was severely abused at the hands of her master. Three days after giving birth, she was forced to go back to work, and her master whipped her with an ox-goad (also called a cattle prod) after she failed to do her job correctly. Compton fell ill with puerperal fever because of this incident, but eventually recovered. Compton mortgaged herself against a loan several times in various attempts to buy her freedom, but could not make her payments and consequently became enslaved again. In one such attempt, Compton became enslaved to her creditor and was separated from Dubois. As a child, Dubois lived in Flagtown, and at 14 years old she moved to a town called Great Bend on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania to work on the tavern of her master, Dominicus \\"Minna\\" Dubois. While in bondage, Dubois often did tasks that were considered \\"men's work\\" such as working the field and ferrying boats at a tavern on the Susquehanna. In her biography, Dubois recounts how she frequently cheated the other ferrymen out of customers and money. Larison portrays Dubois as 5 feet 10 inches, 200 pounds, and \\"well-proportioned.\\" Moreover, he describes Dubois as industrious, \\"capable of great endurance,\\" and strong. According to Larison, Dubois enjoyed making children afraid of her by telling them that she would kidnap children and swallow them alive. Dubois also drank heavily, danced, and fought with both men and women. While Dubois described her master Minna as agreeable towards her, her mistress was abusive and domineering. Dubois described her as \\"the very devil himself.\\" In one instance, her mistress whipped her so badly that she gave Dubois scars that she would have for the rest of her life. In another, Dubois claims that the mistress cracked her skull with a shovel. Freedom In 1808, when Minna was out on grand-jury duty in Wilkes-Barre, the mistress had Dubois scrub the bar- room because company was over. Dubois did not do the scrubbing to her liking, and the mistress hit her. In retaliation, Dubois hit the mistress so hard that she fell down and landed against the door. Dubois thought that she had killed her at first. The other people in the bar-room attempted to intervene, but Dubois threatened them with physical violence, and no one approached her. Dubois fled to Chenang Point in New York, but her master Minna sent for her. She went back to Great Bend, and Minna told her that if she took her child to New Jersey, he would write her a pass and officially give Dubois her freedom. Consequently, Dubois took her baby and went to Flagtown, New Jersey to find her mother. There, she discovered that her mother had moved to New Brunswick, so she tracked her down and remained there for years. In 1812, Dubois‚Äô grandfather bought Cedar Summit on Sourland Mountain where he opened Put's Tavern, an establishment known for being rowdy. Dubois set up her homestead near the tavern and took care of her grandfather, inheriting the tavern after he died. In the 1830s, Dubois and her two youngest daughters, Elizabeth Alexander and Charlotte Moore went to court multiple times for disturbance of the peace, assault, and operation of an unlicensed house. Around the year 1840, Dubois' tavern and home burned down, and she lost her property for failing to pay taxes. = Later years and death = Dubois' second home burned down in between this time and 1883, and she spent the rest of her life living in relative destitution at Sourland Mountain. Dubois died six years after Larison interviewed her at the age of either 100 or 101. Her body rests in Stoutsburg Cemetery in Sourland Mountain, New Jersey. Silvia Dubois: A Biografy of the Slav who Whipt Her Mistres and Gand Her Fredom Sample text of C.W. Larison's orthography in Silvia Dubois : a biografy of the slav who whipt her mistres and gand her fredom C.W. Larison, the writer of Sylvia Dubois' biography Silvia Dubois (Now 116 Yers Old) A Biografy of the Slav who Whipt Her Mistres and Gand Her Fredom, was a physician and former educator interested in documenting local history. He first met with Dubois at Cedar Summit in January 1883 to interview her. He met her a total of three times before releasing her biography. Larison wrote the book in a phonetic orthography of his own creation. Historian Jared C. Lobdell edited, translated the phonetic spelling, and wrote an introduction for a new publication of Dubois‚Äô biography by Larison. The authenticity of Dubois' stories as told to Larison are debated. Lobdell cautions that Dubois' story bridges the line between history and folklore, but that it has value as an account of \\"social history.\\" He directly challenges Dubois' assertion that she was 116 at the time of her interviews by finding historical evidence to the contrary. However, English professor DoVeanna S. Fulton criticizes Lobdell's labeling of the story as folklore because it gives history with documentation privilege over oral history.

TMEM239 appears to be expressed at moderate levels in the testes, with low expression in a variety of other tissues, including the brain and submaxillary gland.  Interactions  TMEM239 protein interactions appear to be implicated in cell signaling, membrane transport and immunology. Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 Protein TAX-1 (TAX) and Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were found to interact with TMEM239 through a host-pathogen yeast two hybrid screen. Additional TMEM239 protein interactions were identified through a human interactome mapping project. Synthenein-1 (SDCBP) is involved in the trafficking of transmembrane proteins, in addition to neuro and immunomodulation, exosome biogenesis and tumorigenesis. SDCBP is regulated by TGFB1-mediated SMAD2/3. A number of other cell signaling proteins physically associated with TMEM239, including Cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF-7), FYVE, RhoGEF and PH domain-containing protein 2 (FGD2) and Syndecan binding protein (SDCBP). The Golgi SNAP receptor complex member 1 (GOS1) was found to associate with TMEM239. A member of the super-family of proteins called t-SNAREs, GOS1 mediates transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Lastly, the protein Alpha-N-methyltransferease (TAE1) was found to interact with TMEM239. TAE1 catalyzes the methylation of alpha-amino groups of Alanine or Serine residues in [Ala/Ser]-Pro-Lys motifs and Pro-Pro-Lys motifs. TAE1 is also responsible for methylating a number of ribosomal proteins.  Clinical significance  SNP rs7360412, located in the 3‚ÄôUTR of TMEM239, was identified in a genome-wide association study of quantitative phenotypes for bipolar disorder as a top marker for fractional anisotropy. In this context, fractional anisotropy, as detected by diffusion tensor imaging, was used to assess white matter integrity. White matter integrity is highly heritable and reduced in both bipolar patients and their unaffected relatives. RNA-seq was used to analyze the transcriptomes of human and Leishmania primary cutaneous lesions, in order to understand differences in host and parasitic factors influencing the progression of Localized Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (LCL) to Mucosal Leishmaniasis (ML). Decreased expression of TMEM239 in a primary cutaneous lesions indicates a higher probability of ML development.

Founded in 1948, it is the only Chinese school in Santiago, Isabela, Philippines. History The school was first established in 1948 and was known as the Santiago Chinese School then. Its classroom were built out of Nipa and bamboo at its former location at the heart of Santiago City (then Santiago, Isabela). Three years later the rooms were renovated using walls as construction materials to provide stronger protection from the elements and the weather. This school was home to many students for the next two decades. However, as years passed by, the gradual increase in number of students began to pose a space problem. The problem of scarcity of classrooms to accommodate both the children from the Chinese community and non-ethnic families wishing to avail of the quality system of instructions of SCI for their children was obviously to be addressed. The eventual dearth of rooms and campus space prompted the school's Board of Trustees (then the Board of Directors) to seek solutions in order that the school can satisfy the educational yearnings of a sizable portion of the city's population. The most feasible solution was the construction of new school building. So in 1966, the school board bought a piece of property for the school's future relocation. The Board of Trustees foresight soon proved to be beneficial. In view of the burgeoning student population in 1976, the school authorities had no more option but to relocate to the newly acquired school site with an area of six thousand seven hundred square meters (acquired a decade before). The construction of project of the skill however entailed a big sum of money. Pursuing this under time constraint further complicated the problem. Considering the importance of the undertaking, the Board of Directors decided to push through with more vigor. The groundwork for the construction of new school building at SCI's present location at Plaridel started in 1977. Hard- pressed for funds, the school administration and its Board of Trustees sought the support of the many magnanimous and philanthropic individuals and organizations through a fund raising drive. Auspiciously, the project was completed without any hitch. In 1978, the new school building was finally completed. This edifice has evolved as a concrete and symbolic marker of the cooperation, love, commitment, and hard-work rendered by different people who shared the same vision and aspirations for the youth of the generations to come. The Santiago Cultural Institute is still located in the same 6,700 square meter lot Over the years since 1978, it has embarked on a number of modernization and upgrading programs in its educational curricula and facilities.Lobo, Henry M., Pascual, Aimee O.

It is exempt, i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See (notably the Roman Congregation for the Oriental Churches), not part of any ecclesiastical province.  History  Between 1720 and 1760 large communities of Armenian Catholic refugees from Turkey and Persia settled in the territory of the North Caucasus. The flow of Armenian immigrants to Christian Russia increased with the Armenian genocide executed by the Turkish authorities, especially since the late nineteenth century. Some of the faithful were able to take refuge in southern Armenia and Georgia. From 1907 in Krasnodar there was a special vicar for priests of the Armenian Catholic rite. In 1760 the Catholics in Astrakhan were 1/5 of the population of the city and they had a parish. Armenian Catholic communities were established in Astrakhan, Voronezh, Penza, Rostov- on-Don, Saratov, Samara and Tsaritsyn. Another region of mass residence of Armenian Catholics was Georgia, in Ajaltsije, Ajalkalaki, Bogdanovsky and Chirac. In 1848 the Diocese of Tiraspol was created with headquarters in Saratov, to which the Armenian Catholic parishes were added in Russian territory as a dean. In 1850 Pope Pius IX established an Armenian eparchy of Artvin for the Catholic Armenian faithful of the Ottoman Empire and Russia.Parroquia de San Gregorio el Iluminador de Armenia Iglesia cat√≥lica en la ciudad de Mosc√∫ In 1878 Russia occupied all the territory of this eparchy and, by decision of the authorities, subjected its parishes to the Latin eparchy of Tiraspol. However, this situation was not recognized by Rome until 1912, but the eparchy of Artvin formally continued to exist until 1972.The Evangelization Station. The Armenian Catholics in Russia In 1909 the pope appointed Sarkis Der Aprahamian as apostolic administrator for Armenian Catholics, as a formal part of Artvin's non-existent eparchy. In the 7 ecclesiastical districts of the administration there were 86 parishes: Alexandropol or Gyumri (16 parishes), Lori (6 parishes), Ajalkalaki (12 parishes), Ajaltsije (17 parishes), Artvin (17 parishes), Karin (12 parishes) and Crimea (6 parishes). The current Armenian Catholic community in the Caucasus and southern Russia and Ukraine arose during the Armenian emigration from Turkey after the peace treaties at the end of the First World War. With the fall of the communist regime, which had almost suppressed the Armenian Catholic Church in the Soviet Union, on July 13, 1991, Pope John Paul II established the Ordinariate for the faithful of the Armenian rite who live in countries of Eastern Europearmeniancatholic.org (except Poland, Romania and Greece) for Armenian Catholics in the former Soviet republics of Armenia, Georgia, Russia and Ukraine. The priest of the Mekhitarist Order, Nerses Der Nersessian, was appointed first ordinary and consecrated bishop on November 17, 1992. = Armenian Catholic Eparchy of Lviv and its incorporation to ordinariate = In 1630 in Lviv the Armenian Apostolic Archbishop Miko≈Çaj Torosowicz united his Church with the Catholic Church and received the Metropolitan title of Archbishop of Poland, Moldavia and Wallachia of the Armenian Archdiocese of Lviv. It existed until its suppression by the Soviet communist authorities in 1945 in the areas of western Ukraine that had belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and were annexed by the Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War. The faithful were transferred to Siberia or took refuge in Poland and the bishop died in prison. After the end of communism the archeparchy was not revived - although it was not suppressed, its cathedral of the Assumption of Mary was delivered by the Government to the Armenian Apostolic Church and its territory incorporated into the Ordinariate.ARMENIAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITY IN RUSSIA  Territory and statistics  The ordinariate includes the jurisdiction over all Armenian Catholics in Armenia, Georgia, Russia and Ukraine. The Cathedral of the Holy Martyrs in Gyumri, northwest of Armenia, is the cathedral episcopal see of the ordinariate. In Russia, the faithful of the Armenian Catholic Church live mainly in the southern regions of the country and in large cities: Pskov, Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar, Sochi, Irkutsk, Omsk, Ulan Ude and Chita. Because of the lack of their own Armenian Catholic hierarchy and clergymen, the faithful of the Armenian Catholic Church mostly visit the Latin parishes. In every Latin eparchies of Russia, there are clergymen (mostly Armenians) who are ordained by the Ordinariate of Eastern Europe with jurisdiction over the faithful of the Armenian Catholic Church residing in these Latin dioceses. In Moscow there is the \\"Parish of St. Grigor the Illuminator\\"Conclusion of the Expert Council for the conduct of the state religious expertise in relation to the Local Religious Organization \\"Parish of St. Gregory the Illuminator of the Armenian Catholic Church, whose services are performed in the Latin Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. Also in Ukraine, due to the smallness of the Armenian clergy, the communities are often entrusted to the Latin-rite clergy. In Georgia there is the parish of Saint Gregory the Illuminator in Tbilisi. In 2016, there were 618,000 believers in 44 parishes. Especially in Russia and Ukraine, the faithful are entrusted to the Latin priests because of their small number.

Some of the people who lived in the fort climbed up a tower and were saved by boats. A strip of land running for fifty miles and lying five miles from the fort rose up after the earthquake to form an embankment. This strip was noticed by the people at the fort and named as \\"Allah bund\\" or the mound/embankment of Allah or God. The Indus river changed its course gradually after the earthquake and cut through the newly created bund. Allah bund is now thought to indicate a fault line. When Alexander Burnes visited the site in 1828 he found a single tower rising above the water. The catastrophic change in the landscape was used as an example of geological change by Charles Lyell in his landmark Principles of Geology (1832).

Al-Shabaab militants launched an attack on a Kenyan-run AMISOM army base in the town of El Adde, Gedo, Somalia. It remains the deadliest attack on the AMISOM Peace Support Mission to Somalia and is the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) largest defeat since independence in 1963. As such, the Kenyan government went to extreme lengths to conceal the extent of its losses.http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/31/africa/kenya-soldiers-el-adde- massacre/index.html It has been described by the media as a \\"military massacre\\" or military disaster. It was also the largest military defeat in Kenyan history.No answers from Kenya on deaths of 150 troopsShabab and East African Front Militants Compete for Notoriety  Background  In 2011, Kenya joined the African Union Mission to Somalia. In that time, the KDF has occupied the southern Gedo Region of Somalia with a presence of around 3,000 troops. According to Somali army General Abas Ibrahim Gurey, clear and reliable intelligence of an imminent attack had been passed along to the commanding officer in charge of the El Adde base, 45 days in advance.  Kenyan army base attack  On 15 January, at 6:30 a.m before morning prayers, a suicide bomber detonated his explosive laden armoured personnel carrier to the front gate to an AMISOM garrison base in El-Adde, Gedo, Somalia. The base compound housed a Company-sized garrison of men belonging to both the 9th and 5th Kenya Rifles. Both Kenyan Rifle Battalions were detached to the El-Adde base only two weeks beforehand. The total size of the garrison that day has been generally put at around 200 Kenyan troops present. According to KDF spokesperson General Samson Mwathethe, the explosion was three times more powerful than the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Nairobi. The massive blast damaged the command and communications buildings, as well as an armory and fuel depots of the base, killing dozens of soldiers. Al Shabaab named the suicide bomber as AbduQadir Ali. The suicide explosion was a precursor to an estimated 150 to 300 Al-Shabaab fighters assaulting the base with rocket- propelled grenades and assault weapons. The attack caught Kenyan troops unprepared and asleep. At approximately 7:30 a.m, the battle lasted for more than one hour of fierce fighting, until Kenyan troops were routed from the base and fled into the dense bush pursued by Al Shabaab militants. A neighboring Somali National Army (SNA) base located 600 meters away from the AMISOM base, was empty of troops, who allegedly left and were pre-warned hours before the attack, per the Kenyan military. It was initially reported that the SNA base came under assault and Kenyan troops were supporting the Somali Army and that the KDF had incurred unspecified losses. However, this story was revised. =Tactical failures= According to the Cable News Network (CNN), \\"The apparent ease with which the militants breached barriers at El Adde has surprised many security analysts  especially since the same style of assault had been seen before in bloody attacks on AMISOM forces.\\" One Western diplomat based in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, told CNN this was clearly a \\"tactical disaster\\" for the Kenyans. \\"How can two hundred Al-Shabaab walk across a field in broad daylight without the Kenyans noticing? Where were the KDF's machine guns?\\" he asked. \\"This is contrary to everything they have been taught, and should be doing in a hostile environment.\\"  Casualties  Al Shabaab claimed to have captured 12 Kenyan soldiers, including the commanding officer after the battle. Later al-KatƒÅi‚Äôb Media associated with Al-Shabaab, released a 48-minute-long propaganda video showing the bodies of at least 63 dead KDF soldiers and captured military hardware, including several tanks and long range field artillery. They later claimed to have killed over 100 Kenyan troops, although this has been deemed an understatement. This number does not include ethnic-Somali soldiers in Kenyan uniform. A new death toll from available open source information indicates that ranges from 141 to 185 Kenyan troops, including all officers, were killed in action. Around 40 survivors managed to escape and an unknown number are still unaccounted for. Separately, DNA samples were taken from 143 bodies at the scene, most of which were burned beyond recognition.  Aftermath and reactions  Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta expressed his condolences to the families and vowed militants would pay a heavy price for the attack. He reaffirmed Kenyan support in the AMISOM Peace Support Mission to Somalia and ruled out withdrawal of troops from Somalia. Declaring the terrorists will have no time to breathe. \\"We will not be cowed by these cowards. With our allies, we will continue in Somalia to fulfill our mission. We will hunt down the criminals involved in today's events. Our soldiers‚Äô blood will not be shed in vain.\\" Kenyan bishops around the country offered condolences. The Somali president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud condemned the attack. In a later interview with Somali Cable TV, he described the attack as a \\"defeat\\" in a line of victories and put the KDF death toll at close to 200 fatalities. However, according to a Somali presidential spokesman, he was \\"misquoted\\" on the precise casualty figures when questioned by the Kenyan military. Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari along with Somali president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud made a three-day visit to Kenya to attend a ceremony in honor of the soldiers killed at the Moi army barracks in Eldoret, Kenya. On 22 January, the alleged mastermind of the El Adde attack and leader of the Al Shabaab \\"Abu Zubair battalion\\", Maalim Janow, was killed in retaliatory airstrikes according to Kenya's military. =Cover-up= According to CNN, \\"to prevent details of what happened at El Adde from emerging, Kenya's government used a rarely enforced law prohibiting the distribution of images or information likely to cause public fear and alarm or undermine security operations. One local blogger who tweeted a photograph showing of the aftermath of the attack was promptly arrested. He was later released without charge.\\" \\"There is clearly an attempt to mislead Kenyans and to hide the truth about what happened,\\" said Patrick Gathara, a political commentator and cartoonist who lashed out at the KDF and Kenyan government in local newspapers after the attack. \\"It is being hidden to avoid accountability.\\" \\"Who died for you in El Adde?\\" Gathara believes there is a deliberate attempt \\"to avoid accountability.\\"Added Gathara, \\"It is all very deliberate and designed to avoid public demands for senior officials and officers to be held responsible for failures. \\"The truth about El Adde is being hidden from Kenyans, not from Al-Shabaab.\\" CNN reports, \\"Tellingly, Al-Shabaab's propaganda video uses the Kenyan authorities' own words against them, highlighting the inaccurate KDF press release sent in the immediate aftermath of the attack, and accusing the KDF of \\"distorting the truth and blatantly lying to their public.\\" Analysts say the KDF's lack of transparency has only provided more fodder for Al- Shabaab's ideological battle.\\" \\"Although they cite national security reasons, what they end up doing is creating an opportunity for Al-Shabaab to propagandize their victories, perhaps exaggerate them,\\" said Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council's Africa Center.\\"But there's no way of countering that narrative because there is no real narrative coming from the government.\\" \\"The AU [African Union] would be better served by contesting the Al-Shabaab narrative, not ceding ground to it,\\" said Paul D. Williams, Associate Professor of International Affairs at George Washington University, who specializes in reporting on peacekeeping missions. \\"Silence is not a winning strategy in the world of strategic communications,\\" he told CNN in late January, shortly after the attack.

The convention center was built in order to host the 2016 International Eucharistic Congress held in the city. The facility is owned by the Archdiocese of Cebu and is managed by Regent Property International. History =Background and prior plans= With Cebu City due to host the International Eucharistic Congress (IEC) in 2016, the Archdiocese of Cebu sought a venue for the congress. It was planned that a venue would be built out of the unfinished shell of a privately owned commercial building behind ParkMall in Mandaue which is also near to the Cebu International Convention Center. However, such plans were scrapped in favor of building a venue within the seminary compound of the Archdiocese so that the facility, which will be used for other events of the local church after the IEC, will be more accessible to the archdiocese's constituents. =Construction= The groundbreaking for the IEC Pavilion was done on February 15, 2014, which was attended by Archdiocese of Cebu officials as well as local government officials. Construction commenced in July 2014 and the building was topped off on July 15, 2015. The secretariat building is 95 percent complete while the plenary hall is 69 percent done by July 2015. Overall the facility is 82.8 percent done with September 2015 as the target month of completion by this time. By November 2015, the structure was 97 percent complete with structural and architectural aspects already complete and only finishing works to be done. The IEC Pavilion's construction costed around . =Turnover= Duros Development Corporation, the contractors of the IEC Pavilion, turned over the facility to the Archdiocese of Cebu on November 21, 2015. The following day, on November 22, 2015, which also happens to be the Feast of Christ the King, the IEC Pavilion was opened to the public. The facility was consecrated to Christ the King in a ceremony attended by 7,000 people. =Turnover and inauguration= In October 2016, Regent Property International a firm linked to Duros Construction Inc. formally took over the management of the venue. The former IEC Pavilion was redeveloped into a full-fledged convention center. On December 15, 2016, Duros Land inaugurated the venue as the \\"IEC Convention Center of Cebu\\" or the \\"IC3 Convention Center\\" The St. John XXII Minore Seminary where the convention center stood was made into a development by Duros Land known as the 23 Minore Park. The redevelopment of the seminary which was completed by December 2016 into the 23 Minore Park took about six months. The Archdiocese of Cebu the owners of the property has allowed Duros Land on handling the venue's operation for the next 25 years. Events The IC3 Convention Center was built as the IEC Pavilion, meant as the primary venue of the 2016 International Eucharistic Congress. After the congress, the center has hosted many religious activities organized mainly by its owner, the Archdiocese of Cebu. On May 18, 2017, ALA Boxing Promotions announced that the center will host Pinoy Pride 41, a boxing event headlined by Thai boxer Komgrich Nantapech and Donnie Nietes. Other use During the COVID-19 pandemic a 130-bed capacity quarantine facility for mild and moderate COVID-19 patients was set up in the convention center. Architecture and design The IC3 Convention Center was constructed by property developer, Duros Development Corporation which also financed the project for usufructuary rights for 25 years over the facility. Among the people involved in the construction of the project is architect Carlos Pio Zafra and project-in-charge Engineer Adonis Gabutin. Rizal Camangyan Jr. is also reported to be involved as a construction manager. During the groundbreaking ceremony of the IC3 Convention Center as the IEC Pavilion, IEC secretary Msgr. Dennis Villarojo explains that the structure is dubbed as a \\"Pavilion\\" because the venue would not be convention center with high-end amenities. He described the would-be structure as \\"simple\\" and would provide delegates of the congress in 2016 \\"a comfortable and decent venue\\". He insists that the IEC Pavilion would not be a high-end facility describing the then to be built venue as \\"a roofed structure with walls, floors and will be air-conditioned, Zafra, the architect of the IEC Pavilion said he was instructed that the design of the building is to be \\"simple\\". Camangyan noted that Cebu Auxiliary Bishop Dennis Villarojo called for \\"low maintenance building\\" specifying that there would be no finishes to be done on the floor so that it can be cleaned using a mop. Likewise the walls and ceiling were bare and unadorned. The facility was also to be designed to be earthquake-resistant withstanding strong earthquakes such as the magnitude 7.2 Bohol-Cebu earthquake of 2013. Facilities As the IEC Pavilion, the venue had a plenary hall, a secretariat building, a chapel, a media center, and holding rooms for bishops and priests. The pavilion had three levels As the IC3 Convention Center, the venue has 10,000 seating capacity. The IC3 has three convention halls and a function room. Hall A has a capacity of 3,000 people, Hall B can accommodate 5,000 people, and Hall C can seat 2,000 people. The second level of the convention center which can be used for wedding events and medium-scale conferences can seat about 500 people. The facility also hosts a holding room for performers and breakout rooms for small-scale gatherings. The grand hallway of the convention center is dubbed as the Ganghaan Walk where photos of the 2016 International Eucharistic Congress are exhibited. For the facility's parking space, there are 255 slots available.

It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices. While web applications have been available for mobile devices from the start, they have generally been slower, have had fewer features, and have been less used than native apps. PWA features allow to close the gap to native applications and create similar user experiences. Features include * Work offline * High performance * Background processing in service workers in a separate thread * Access to the phone's sensors * Support for push notifications * An icon on the phone‚Äòs home screen Since a progressive web app is a type of webpage or website known as a web application, they do not require separate bundling or distribution. In particular, there is no requirement for developers or users to install the web apps via digital distribution systems like Apple App Store or Google Play. However, for many PWA providers the lack of visibility of the PWA in those distribution systems is a disadvantage compared to native apps. To varying degrees, the major app stores started to embrace PWAs, allowing them to be found in app stores. As of April 2018, the PWA features are supported to varying degrees by the Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge browsers, but more browsers may support the features needed in the future. Several businesses highlight significant improvements in a wide variety of key performance indicators after PWA implementation, like increased time spent on page, conversions, or revenue. Background At the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Steve Jobs announced that web apps, developed in HTML5 using AJAX architecture, would be the standard format for iPhone apps. No software development kit (SDK) was required, and the apps would be fully integrated into the device through the Safari browser engine. This model was later switched for the App Store, as a means of preventing jailbreakers and of appeasing frustrated developers. In October 2007 Jobs announced that an SDK would be launched the following year. As a result, although Apple continued to support webapps, the vast majority of iOS applications shifted towards the App Store. Beginning in the early 2010s dynamic web pages allowed web technologies to be used to create interactive web applications. Responsive web design, and the screen-size flexibility it provides, made PWA development more accessible. Continued enhancements to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowed web applications to incorporate greater levels of interactivity, making native-like experiences possible on a website, and therefore on PWAs. Firefox released Firefox OS in 2013. It was intended to be an open-source operating system for running webapps as native apps on mobile devices, with Gaia built as its HTML5 interface. The development of Firefox OS ended in 2016. In 2015, designer Frances Berriman and Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell coined the term \\"progressive web apps\\" to describe apps taking advantage of new features supported by modern browsers, including service workers and web app manifests, that let users upgrade web apps to progressive web applications in their native operating system (OS). Google then put significant efforts into promoting PWA development for Android. With Apple's introduction of service worker support for Safari in 2017, PWAs were now supported on the two most commonly-used mobile operating systems, Android and iOS. By 2019, PWAs were available on desktop browsers Microsoft Edge (on Windows) and Google Chrome (on Windows, macOS, Chrome OS and Linux). Characteristics Progressive web apps are designed to work on any browser that is compliant with the appropriate web standards. As with other cross- platform solutions, the goal is to help developers build cross-platform apps more easily than they would with native apps. According to Google Developers, the characteristics of a PWA are: * Progressive ‚Äî Works for every user, regardless of browser choice, using progressive enhancement principles. * Responsive ‚Äî Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or forms yet to emerge. * Faster after initial loading - After the initial loading has finished, the same content and page elements do not have to be re-downloaded each time. * Connectivity independent ‚Äî Service workers allow offline uses, or on low quality networks. * App-like ‚Äî Feels like an app to the user with app- style interactions and navigation. * Fresh ‚Äî Always up-to-date due to the service worker update process. * Safe ‚Äî Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn't been tampered with. * Discoverable ‚Äî Identifiable as an ‚Äúapplication‚Äù by manifest.jsonW3C \\"Web App Manifest\\", Working Draft, retrieved 12 September 2016 and service worker registration, and discoverable by search engines. * Re-engageable ‚Äî Ability to use push notifications to maintain engagement with the user. * Installable ‚Äî Provides homescreen icons without the use of an App Store. * Linkable ‚Äî Can easily be shared via a URL, and does not require complex installation. The technical baseline criteria for a site to be considered a progressive web app by browsers were described by Russell in a follow-up post: * Originate from a secure origin. Served over TLS and green padlock displays (no active mixed content). * Load while offline (even if only a custom offline page). By implication, this means that progressive web apps require service workers. * Reference a web app manifest with at least the four key properties: name, short_name, start_url, and display (with a value of standalone or fullscreen) * An icon at least 144√ó144 large in PNG format. * Use of vector graphics that are indefinitely scalable and require smaller file sizes. Some progressive web apps use an architectural approach called the App Shell Model. In this model, service workers store the Basic User Interface or \\"shell\\" of the responsive web design web application in the browser's offline cache. This model allows for PWAs to maintain native- like use with or without web connectivity. This can improve loading time, by providing an initial static frame, a layout or architecture into which content can be loaded progressively as well as dynamically. Technologies There are many commonly used technologies to create progressive web apps. All PWAs require at minimum a service worker and a manifest. =Manifest= The web app manifest is a W3C specification defining a JSON-based manifest (usually labelled manifest.json) to provide developers a centralized place to put metadata associated with a web application including: * The name of the web application * Links to the web app icons or image objects * The preferred URL to launch or open the web app * The web app configuration data * Default orientation of the web app * The option to set the display mode, e.g. full screen This metadata is crucial for an app to be added to a home screen or otherwise listed alongside native apps. iOS support iOS Safari partially implements manifests, while most of the PWA metadata can be defined via Apple-specific extensions to the meta tags. These tags allow developers to enable full-screen display, define icons and splash screens, and specify a name for the application. =WebAssembly= WebAssembly allows precompiled code to run in a web browser, at near-native speed. Thus, libraries written in languages such as C can be added to web apps. Due to the cost of passing data from JavaScript to WebAssembly, near-term uses will be mainly number- crunching (such as voice recognition and computer vision), rather than whole applications. = Data storage = Progressive Web App execution contexts get unloaded whenever possible, so progressive web apps need to store majority of long-term internal state (user data, dynamically loaded application resources) in one of the following manners  Web Storage  Web Storage is a W3C standard API that enables key-value storage in modern browsers. The API consists of two objects, sessionStorage (that enables session-only storage that gets wiped upon browser session end) and localStorage (that enables storage that persists across sessions). Service workers A service worker is a web worker that implements a programmable network proxy that can respond to web/HTTP requests of the main document. It is able to check the availability of a remote server and to cache content when that server is available, and serve that content later to the document. Service workers, like any other web workers, work separately from the main document context. Service workers can handle push notifications and synchronize data in the background, cache or retrieve resource requests, intercept network requests and receive centralized updates independently of the document that registered them, even when that document is not loaded. Service workers go through a three-step lifecycle of Registration, Installation and Activation. Registration involves telling the browser the location of the service worker in preparation for installation. Installation occurs when there is no service worker installed in the browser for the webapp, or if there is an update to the service worker. Activation occurs when all of the PWAs pages are closed, so that there is no conflict between the previous version and the updated one. The lifecycle also helps maintain consistency when switching among versions of service worker since only a single service worker can be active for a domain. Indexed Database API Indexed Database API is a W3C standard database API available in all major browsers. The API is supported by modern browsers and enables storage of JSON objects and any structures representable as a string. Indexed Database API can be used with a wrapper library providing additional constructs around it. AppCache (obsolete) Application Cache (or AppCache or HTML5 cache manifest) is an earlier technology that allowed the application to cache content in advance for later use when the device is offline. It works adequately for single-page applications which it was designed for, but fails in problematic ways for multi-page applications like wikis. As of May 2019, the technology is supported by major browsers and in use for years by some sites, but it is already deprecated in favor of service workers and will eventually be removed.

Austin: University of Texas Press, 2015. Hailing from Cuba during a time of political uprising, V√°zquez was one of 125,000 people who sought asylum and migrated in the Mariel Boat lifts in 1980. Local to San Francisco's gay scene, V√°zquez began to organize with HIV prevention organization Proyecto ContraSIDA por Vida and became a community activist for transgender rights.Rodr√≠guez, Juana Mar√≠a. Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces. New York: NYU Press, 2003.  Early life  In 1958 Fidel Castro organized the July 26th Movement to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. V√°zquez was born in 1958, and during her birth, homes were burned and cities were destroyed because of the revolution. V√°zquez was born out of wedlock and was adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, with whom she lived. Raised in Camag√ºey, Cuba, V√°zquez spent her childhood walking around downtown and the Casino Campreste. She encountered a large Cuban LGBT community, eventually being baptized as \\"La Chica Streisandisima\\" at the swan fountain in Casino Campreste. Her early involvement with the LGBT community in Camag√ºey and emigration to the United States was the influence for Jaime Cortez's graphic novel Sexile. In Cuba, V√°zquez was inducted into the military but was ineligible for service because of her homosexuality. After being denied, V√°zquez committed herself to education and worked toward her teaching degree at Destacamento Pedagogico Manuel Escunze Domenech.  Migration  On April 4 of 1980, Castro's government announced that any Cuban wanting to leave to the United States was free to go. Castro did this in response to five Cubans who stole a bus and crashed into the Embassy of Peru in Havana, seeking asylum. V√°zquez was one of the people who sought asylum as part of the Mariel Boatlift and emigrated to Florida. Leaving behind family and belongings, V√°zquez departed from the port of El Mosquito, a beach she recalled as unsafe and overcrowded. Her experiences on the Mariel boat for eight hours were less positive until she docked at the island of Key West, Monroe County, Florida. V√°zquez was moved to the Cuban refugee center of Fort Chaffee in the city of Fort Smith, Arkansas and recalls being greeted by the Ku Klux Klan that surrounded the center. Spending a month and half there, Vazquez's experience were generally positive as she recalled the center providing adequate healthcare, churches, and food for refugees. In 1980, V√°zquez was sponsored by the Los Angeles LGBT Center to travel to California. In Los Angeles, she met Rolando Victoria who would become her drag godmother until Victoria's death in 1982. While in California, Vazquez took jobs as a gift wrapper for Neiman Marcus, a hairdresser, and hotel clerk after she moved in 1983 to the Tenderloin district in San Francisco.  Activism  Adela giving away her crown of Miss Gay Latina at 309x309px V√°zquez's activist work began in 1992 when she was crowned Miss Gay Latina, by Instituto Familiar De La Raza‚Äîa community based health and wellness center.Quesada, Uriel, Letitia Gomez, and Salvador Vidal-Ortiz, eds. Queer Brown Voices: Personal Narratives of Latina/o LGBT Activism. University of Texas Press, 2015. Post her crowning, V√°zquez began to organize around transgender rights and issues. She quickly took notice of the large health disparities in the trans community and the need to mobilize. V√°zquez was invited by trans activist Tamara Ching to speak to the issues the trans Latina community faced at the Human Rights Commission at San Francisco's City Hall. Among her many efforts, V√°zquez protested the employment discrimination faced by trans people and their removal from the workplace because of their gender queerness. Adela in 1995 at Proyecto ContraSIDA por Vida Adela performing at Esta Noche (gay bar) Through her outreach, V√°zquez met a drag queen by the name of La Condonera \\"The Condom Women,\\" otherwise known as Hector Le√≥n. Together, Hector and V√°zquez formed a group called Las AtreDivas (a portmanteau of the Spanish word atrevida‚Äîdaring‚Äîand diva), which consisted of four drag queens. Las AtreDivas organized and presented on Spanish language shows at the gay bar Esta Noche, highlighting safer sex practices in order to bring awareness to AIDS and contribute funds for local organizations like Proyecto ContraSIDA.

Plot A young girl named Akiko walks loses her dog when walking along a beach. She follows the dog to a European mansion, where an old man stares at her as she chases after the dog inside. Akiko finds herself in front of a dead woman at a piano and then meets the vampire (Mori Kishida). 18 years later, Akiko (Midori Fujita) is living near a lake, still haunted by what has happened to her, which she believes was a dream. Akiko is friends with a boat operator Kusaku, who had received a strange package, which turns out to be a white coffin. Kusaku complains to the shipping agent and returns to find the coffin empty and is then attacked by the same vampire Akiko saw years earlier. Akiko is then visited by her boyfriend Doctor Takashi Saki (Osahide Takahashi), whom Akiko's sister Natsuko (Sanae Emi) is also in love with. Takashi is called to the hospital when a woman with two bite holes in her neck is turned in. After he leaves, both Akiko's dog and Natsuko go missing. Akiko searches for them and finds her dog dead in a field with Kusaku near by. Kusaku attacks her, which leads to a chase where Akiko is knocked out by a branch. Kusaku takes her back to his home. As Akiko awakens, she sees a vampire just about to bite down on her neck, but is interrupted by two fisherman enquiring about a boat, which makes the vampire and Kusaku retreat. At the hospital, Takashi's patient is beckoned from her bed by the vampire. Takashi spots her, but she falls down a stairway, killing herself. Meanwhile, under the vampire's curse, Natsuko returns to Akiko's home with the vampire himself. Akiko attempts to hide in the closet, while the returning Takashi is attacked in his car by Kusaku. The car crashes and the two battle, with Takashi being victorious after Kusaku expires. After Takashi returns home, both Akiko and Takashi find Natsuko dying on a beach. With her dying breath, Natsuko begs for her corpse to be burned. Takashi and Akiko take her to the hospital for an autopsy. At the hospital, Natsuko is being prepared in a morgue when she rises from the dead and escapes. At the same Takashi hypnotizes Akiko in order to have her relive her \\"dream\\". Akiko then remembers the incident with the vampire from her youth as actually happening and that the incident made her the favourite daughter of both their parents. Along with Takashi, Akiko decides to return to the mansion from the past where they find the dead body of the old man who lived there along with his diary. In it he states that while he is not Japanese his father built the house in a remote part of Japan as he was the descendant of a vampire and wanted to avoid putting others in danger. The old man himself was never a vampire, but at the age of 25 his son succumbed to vampirism and killed a woman. Shortly after a young girl and her dog wandered into the house, found the woman's corpse, and encountered the son after which he was able to help them escape. In response, he locked the son away. The son eventually broke free and fed on his father who wrote the diary before he succumbed to blood loss. The two are then attacked by the vampire and Natsuko. The vampire fights Takashi on a balcony, but the old man, now reanimated as a vampire, grabs the vampire's leg, which causes him to stumble, breaking through the wooden railing that had been damaged during the struggle. A large portion of it impales him through the chest causing him to crumble into dust. Natsuko collapses, the curse broken, as both she and the old man lose their vampiric features and return to being human corpses.

It was dubbed into English and given a television release in 1980 in the United States by United Productions of America under the title The Lake of Dracula. In the U.S. television prints of the film, the ending involving the vampire disintegrating was removed. The television version was cut to 79 minutes.

It was the first gay Latino bar in San Francisco, and it was attractive to many people from the Latino community because it provided a space to drink, party, engage in hookup culture, organize and perform. The bar first opened in 1979 and was the last Latino bar standing on 16th Street by 1997.  History  Esta Noche was founded by two openly gay community members, Anthony Lopez and Manuel Quijano. It is historically placed as the first gay Latino gay bar, and it has significance due to the discrimination LGBT people of color faced in traditionally popular white gay bars, especially in the Castro district. LGBT people of color often experienced racial slurs, microaggressions, and fetishization, as the bars where LGBT people were able to socialize and party were mostly dominated by white men. LGBT people of color were often asked to show multiple forms of identification in these spaces. In addition, Latino men in those spaces would experience racist remarks as well as being overly fetishized for their culture. These experiences led to the creation of Esta Noche. The co-founder of the group Gay American Indians (GAI), Randy Burns, said that the frustration at this discrimination was also what led his group to form, and members often met at Esta Noche. Esta Noche also has its roots in the Gay Latino Alliance (GALA), as one of the GALA members sold their house to buy the bar. GALA and Esta Noche worked together in advertising the space as the gay Latino bar of the Mission District in San Francisco, which ultimately resurfaced tensions that the organization was dealing with. With the establishment of Esta Noche came the shift of gay Latino representation from GALA to the bar life.  Culture  In March 2008 Esta Noche is defined as a \\"working-class\\" bar. The bar served more than people looking for a good time and party; it also provided an important space for those seeking to network with other LGBT people of color. Esta Noche has been defined as a \\"community organizing center and host to many fundraisers for health clinics, people with AIDS, and other lower-income populations.\\" The bar gave room for comedy nights where famous Latina comedian Marga Gomez starred. Esta Noche was also famously known for their drag shows; there were sometimes even six shows a week. A popular drag show was the Selena nights, in which drag queens dressed and performed as Selena. Another notable person that Esta Noche collaborated with was Diane Felix. People who went to the bar recalled it as a space where people of color, Latinos in particular, could come together and have a space where they would not receive racist discrimination or homophobia. = Recognition = Esta Noche was nominated for the San Francisco Pride Marshalls. However, they lost to the Billy DeFrank LGBT Community Center in San Jose, California. They were running against the UCSF Positive Health Program. Esta Noche was featured in the HBO series Looking for 2 seasons. By the recording of the second season in November 2014, the bar was already closed.  Closing  In 2013, Esta Noche was threatened with closure, after the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted new laws related to licensing and permit fees. The club launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, but it was unable to secure enough funds to stay open. In early 2014, it was announced the club was closing down. The closing was treated as a significant loss to community members, and the bar was generally perceived as another victim of gentrification. Many efforts were made to stop the closing of the bar; for example the \\"queens of San Francisco drag queens, Heklina and Anna Conda spearheaded a fundraiser to try to save the venue in May 2014. However, they were unable to save the bar. The closing of the bar has been tied to the increasing of property tax in the area, which has caused gentrification. Gentrification has also affected many other Latino bars, which have had to close. By 1997, Esta Noche was the only Latino-owned bar standing in 16th Street. Bond, another night club, now sits in place of Esta Noche.

Pope Urban IV had sided with the bishops against the King. Cardinal Guy summoned the king to a meeting, but, justifiably pleading the lack of security, the King refused to attend, and appealed directly to the Pope. Cardinal Guy then travelled to L√ºbeck, where he met with the Archbishop and several other exiled bishops. Obtaining no satisfaction from the Legate, Archbishop Erlandsen travelled to Viterbo to deal directly with the new Pope, Clement IV; he never returned to Denmark.Roy, Nouvelle histoire Tome IV, \\"Guy XXIII. Abb√© de Citeaux,\\" pp. 6-14. Cardinal Guy then visited Sweden, where he granted an indulgence to the Cistercian abbey church of Nydala.Claes Gejrot, Diplomata novevallensia: the Nydala charters 1172-1280 (Stockholm 1994) pp. 30 and 158. He celebrated a synod at Vienna on 10 May 1267, attended by six bishops and many other prelates, in which, among other things, he attempted once again to demand clerical celibacy and the separation of clerics from their wives and concubines.Roy, pp. 15-36. He visited Krak√≥w beginning on 28 June 1267. He celebrated another synod at Bratislava in Hungary, attended by eight bishops, in the same year. He preached the Holy Land Crusade.A. Kollar, Analecta monumentorum omnis aevi Vindoboniensia I (Vindobonae 1761), pp. 3-28. Roy, pp. 37-38. He was recalled by Pope Clement IV in a letter of 8 May 1267.Clemens IV, Epistles 324 (ed. Matthias Thumser). and again in late October, 1267.Clemens IV, Epistles 396 (ed. Thumser). Pope Clement wrote to him on October 26/27, 1267, that he was sending a legate to replace him, though travel was being blocked by Conradin; as soon as the legate arrives, he is to return to Viterbo.Registres de Cl√©ment IV no. 1265, p. 415. Salvador Miranda states that \\"he celebrated a synod in Breslau on February 2, 1268.\\"Roy, p. 37, notes that it may have been in January, 1238, not February (which was still 1237, in the calendar where New Year's Day is on March 25). A subscription of Cardinal Guy, however, indicates that he was back in Viterbo on 28 February 1268.Potthast, no. 20276. The correct date for the synod is probably in 1267, not 1268, especially considering Pope Clement's repeated letters of May and October, 1267. Cardinal Gui took part in the very long Election of 1268‚Äì1271 at Viterbo, following the death of Clement IV, which came to be known as the first conclave.John P. Adams, Sede Vacante of 1268-1271., retrieved 02/02/2016. He signed the letter of protest, as did all of the Cardinals, on 20 August 1270, which required the Podest√† and the people of Viterbo to swear not to molest the Cardinals or the members of their entourages.

Cardinal Guy de Bourgogne died less than two months later, on 20 May 1272.Eubel, p. 8. Gallia christiana IV (Paris 1728), p. 996, states that Cardinal Guy was present at the Second Council of Lyons, which opened on 1 May 1274, and that he died on 20 May 1274.

It is used by people currently in the United States in a non-immigrant status to change the classification for their status and/or extend their stay with their current status. Both the current status and the status to which the transition is being sought must be non-immigrant visa statuses. The corresponding form used for Adjustment of Status to that of a Lawful Permanent Resident is Form I-485. However, whereas Form I-485 is always needed when adjusting status within the United States to that of Lawful Permanent Resident from a non- immigrant status, Form I-539 is only needed for some kinds of transitions or extensions of stay.  Extension of stay  = Extendable current statuses = For the following current statuses, any extension of stay beyond that specified on the Form I-94 requires the filing of Form I-539: * A visa: ambassadors, public ministers, career diplomatic or consular officers and their immediate family members * A-3 visa: attendants, servants, and personal employees of A visa holders and their immediate family members * B visa (B-1/B-2 are the business and tourism visas) * CW-1 dependents * E visa dependents * F visa (only the public secondary school case) and their dependents * G * G-5 * H dependents * K-3 (fianc√©(e) of U.S. citizen) and minor children * K-4 (spouse of U.S. citizen) and minor children * L (intracompany transferees‚Äô) dependents * M (vocational students) and their dependents. Note that this includes those applying for post-completion Optional Practical Training * N (parents and children of certain special immigrants) * NATO-7 ‚Äì Attendants, Servants, Personal Employees of NATO Representatives, Officials, Employees and Immediate Family Members * O (aliens with extraordinary ability) dependents * P (athletes‚Äô and entertainers‚Äô) dependents * R (religious worker) dependents * TD dependents of TN visa holders = Non-extendable current statuses = For the following categories, it is not possible to change status while in the United States, or extend stay beyond that specified in Form I-94: * C (Alien in Transit) * D (Crewman) * K-1 or K-2 (Fianc√©(e) or Dependent of Fianc√©(e)) * K-3 or K-4 (Certain Husbands and Wives of U.S. Citizens and their Dependent Children) * S (Witness or Informant) * TWOV (Transit without Visa) * WT or WB (entrants under the Visa Waiver Program) The most numerically significant of these ineligible categories is entrants under the Visa Waiver Program. They cannot use Form I-539 except in exceptional circumstances. Thus, even people from VWP-eligible countries who believe they might need to extend their stay or change their status should get B visas. For the following categories, there are restrictions concerning one's ability to request a change in one's nonimmigrant status: * J-1 visa (exchange visitor subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement) * M-1 visa (vocational student, cannot transition to F-1 or any H visa that they trained for) = College student exception = For students on F visa (in post-secondary institutions) and their dependents, if the Form I-94 (or any update to it from a previously filed Form I-539) specifies \\"Duration of Status\\" (abbreviated \\"D/S\\") as the expiration date, then one simply needs to extend the underlying authorization. Explicitly, an updated Form I-20 needs to be issued to the student by the international office at his or her institution, with a new expiration date. No Form I-539 need be filed. Note that this works only if the new Form I-20 is issued prior to the expiration date of the old Form I-20. Even if transferring to a different educational institution, there is no need to file Form I-539. In general, the responsibility of keeping the student's information up-to-date lies with the Designated School Official at the institution, who acts as the intermediary between the student and the government bureaucracy. All reporting requirements imposed on students are to the DSO rather than directly to USCIS or DHS. In addition, those applying for Optional Practical Training need to first get a new Form I-20 indicating their institution's approval for the OPT, and then get an Employment Authorization Document from the USCIS by filing Form I-765. M students who entered for a fixed duration or course of study, as well as F students who did not get \\"D/S\\" as their expiration date (this includes all those who are studying at the K-12 level) do need to file Form I-539 to extend status or transfer to another institution.  Change of status  = To a temporary nonimmigrant worker = Any change of status to a status as a temporary nonimmigrant worker must be accomplished by filing Form I-129. Form I-539 is not necessary to accomplish this change of status. Thus, for instance, if trying to transition from F status to H-1B status, only Form I-129 need be filed, and not Form I-539. Similarly, Form I-129 needs to be filed when transitioning from one temporary nonimmigrant worker status to another. Since temporary nonimmigrant worker statuses are tied to specific jobs, a new Form I-129 needs to be filed even when changing to a new employer with the same type of status. = To the dependent of a temporary nonimmigrant worker = When changing status to the dependent of a temporary nonimmigrant worker, Form I-539 must be filed. An example is a change from student status to H-4 status, the status for dependents of people on other H visas. A single Form I-539 can be filed for all the dependents (such as the spouse and children) of the Form I-129 beneficiary. = To a student = Those who want to transition to a student or scholar or dependent status (such as F, J, or M) must first get the corresponding authorization from the institution (such as Form I-20 for F status and Form DS-2019 for J status) and then use that to file Form I-539. If transferring to student status using Form I-539, it is necessary to first pay the same SEVIS fee that applicants from outside the United States need to pay in order to apply for their visa. Until the Form I-539 is approved, the person is not officially in student status and cannot start classes. This also applies for people transitioning from F-2 status to F-1 status. The process generally takes 3‚Äì6 months, which can be considerably longer than traveling outside the United States and getting a new visa. For those who entered the United States using a B visa, having an annotation on the visa saying that the entrant is a \\"Prospective Student\\" is generally a prerequisite for the Form I-539 application to be accepted. In general, the USCIS does not approve transition to student status with a start date more than 30 days prior to the program start date. Therefore, applications where the applicant's current status expires more than 30 days before the start date of their program are likely to be rejected.  Filing details  = Modalities =  Paper  Form I-539 can always be submitted by paper. The form is available for download from the USCIS website. The filing address depends on the type of status change or extension that the applicant is requesting. The possible filing addresses include lockbox facilities, service centers, and (in the case of diplomatic statuses) appropriate international bodies.  Electronic  Form I-539 may be filed electronically using the Electronic Information System (ELIS) for some categories. A single ELIS account created by a person can be used for repeated filings of Form I-539 for extension of stay or change of status. = Supporting documents = Form I-539 is generally not filed in isolation; it must be supported by two kinds of proofs. * The first set of proofs establishes the applicant's good standing with immigration law so far: the applicant entered on a valid visa based on a valid authorization and has a valid Form I-94. * The second set of proofs depends on whether the applicant is requesting an extension of stay or a change of status:  In the case of extension of stay, the applicant must demonstrate that he or she can finance the rest of his or her stay, and also plans to depart after the extended stay is over.  In the case of change of status, the applicant must show eligibility for the new status. For instance, if transitioning to the F visa status, the applicant must include a copy of the Form I-20. In general, when requesting a change of status, the set of proofs submitted must be similar to those that would be needed if applying for a visa with the new status. The applicant must also demonstrate that the earliest date he or she can start in the new status is before the expiration date on the Form I-94 for the current status. = Fees = For most cases, the filing fee is $370, with no additional fees. There are a few exceptions: * For V nonimmigrants and CNMI initial grant of status, there is an additional $85 biometric fee. * For A and G extensions, there is no filing fee.  Relation with Form I-94 and approval timeline  = Expiration date = People who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents, when they enter the United States at a designated port of entry with a valid visa, are issued a Form I-94 (those who enter using the VWP are issued a Form I-94W, but they are not eligible to file Form I-539). This form contains an entry for the expiration date. There are two ways the expiration date may be entered: * An actual date. In this case, the applicant's stay in the United States is valid if the status the applicant entered in is still valid and the expiration date has not yet passed. If either condition is violated the applicant's stay in the United States is not authorized. * \\"D/S\\" or \\"EOS\\" indicating that the I-94 does not place any restrictions on the validity of the person's stay, so that the person can stay as long as otherwise authorized. Section 3 of Form I-539 gives the applicant the opportunity to specify a new requested end date (in 1.a.) or either request or indicate that he or she has already been granted D/S. The end date for the approved Form I-539 (whether an actual date or D/S) overrides whatever was there in the Form I-94. = Filing timeline = It is important to make sure that the Form I-539 application is sent in (and ideally, that it is approved) prior to the expiration date of the Form I-94. The USCIS recommends filing the Form I-539 at least 45 days prior to the expiration date on the Form I-94. Late submissions are likely to result in denial. = Without Form I-94 = In the case that the applicant does not have a Form I-94 (either a paper form or an electronic form that he or she can print out), the applicant must contact his or her nearest Deferred Inspection Site managed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in order to obtain proof of lawful entry to the United States. = After expiry = The USCIS says that if it has not reached a decision on the Form I-539 by the expiration date of the Form I-94, the applicant is no longer in authorized status. However, removal proceedings are unlikely to be initiated against the applicant and, if they are, then the pending Form I-539 can be used as a mitigating factor against the removal. Moreover, despite not being in a lawful status, the applicant does not accrue \\"unlawful presence\\" for purposes of inadmissibility to the United States. Once the application is approved, the approval retroactively makes lawful the time spent by the applicant in the United States after the expiration of the original Form I-94. If the application is denied, the applicant must immediately depart the United States (if it is denied before the expiration date, the applicant has until the expiration date of the Form I-94 to depart). = After approval = Once the Form I-539 is approved, the applicant is in a position to extend stay or transition to the new status (from the start date indicated on the Form I-539). Until receiving the approval, the applicant cannot engage in any activities that require being in the new status.  Effect on visa  As a general rule, Form I-539 does not extend the validity of existing visas. To the contrary, a change of status accomplished through Form I-539 can invalidate the existing visa. = In case of extension of stay = Form I-539 may be used to extend one's stay on the same status as one currently has. This extension of stay does not change the terms of one's entry visa. In particular, it does not change whether the visa was a single-entry visa or a multiple-entry visa, nor does it change the period of validity (i.e., the expiration date) of the visa. = In case of change of status = When Form I-539 is used to change status, it invalidates any visa obtained that was associated with the applicant's previous status. Thus, whenever the applicant next travels outside the United States, the applicant is required to obtain a new visa to re-enter the United States. = Automatic visa revalidation = If the applicant's new status is a category eligible for automatic visa revalidation, then, after successfully transitioning to the new status, he or she may use automatic visa revalidation to travel to Mexico, Canada, or (for some statuses) the Caribbean islands and return in less than 30 days. Instead of the \\"visa\\", what gets revalidated is the change of status, and therefore in lieu of the visa the applicant must carry the Form I-797 Approval Notice in addition to all the other supporting documentation. In particular, it does not matter if the applicant has never acquired a visa for the new status, nor does it matter if the previous status for which the applicant did have a visa did not allow for automatic visa revalidation.

Beltz is best known for having coached Kerber during her successfully 2016 Australian Open and 2016 US Open campaigns. Coaching career Beltz first started working with Angelique Kerber when the German turned professional in 2003. However, it was not until 2011 that Kerber made her career breakthrough, reaching the semi-finals of the 2011 US Open when ranked 92nd in the world. Since then, Kerber has achieved a multitude of successes on the WTA Tour, winning her first two career titles in 2012, reaching a then-career high ranking of world number five and qualifying for the prestigious WTA Tour Championships in Istanbul. Beltz then parted ways with Kerber at the end of 2013. However, in the early part of 2015, Beltz was rehired as Kerber's coach after the German suffered from a series of poor results to start the season, including losing in the first round of the 2015 Australian Open and dropping out of the WTA's top 10 for the first time since 2012. Upon their reunion, Kerber rediscovered the form that catapulted her into the world's top 10, winning four titles but not being able to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final during the year. Beltz has been credited with helping Kerber win her first Grand Slam title at the 2016 Australian Open, where the German defeated defending champion and then-world number one Serena Williams in the final in three sets. Kerber subsequently won the Olympic Silver Medal and a second Grand Slam title at the US Open (displacing Williams as the world number one in the process); in addition, she also finished runner-up at the WTA Finals and finished the year on top of the world rankings.

Its name, \\"Namu\\" (ÎÇòÎ¨¥) translates literally to \\"tree\\" in Korean. According to its slogan (\\"The tree of knowledge that you grow together\\") and self-description, Namuwiki strives to share community-driven knowledge and information, whilst respecting the freedom and equal rights of every user. Compared to Wikipedia, material found on Namuwiki largely retains the personal/subjective style of writing characteristic of the Rigveda Wiki, a Korean Otaku wiki from which Namuwiki forked. It has been criticized for lack of accuracy and neutrality, but as of January 2020, Namuwiki was ranked the largest wiki in the Korean language, larger and more popular than the Korean Wikipedia. History In April 2015, one of the largest Otaku subculture wikis in Korea, Rigveda Wiki, suffered a massive community dispute when the site owner, Cheongdong, was discovered to have secretly changed the user agreement to privatize the wiki for his personal profit. Users vandalized articles in protest, forcing the closure of the servers. In response, Namuwiki was created as a fork by a user named Namu on April 17. The article count of Namuwiki surpassed that of Rigveda Wiki by April 25, and surpassed Rigveda Wiki's original article count before its vandalism on May 12. Namuwiki emerged as one of the biggest wikis forked from the Rigveda Wiki, and soon became its de facto replacement. In May 2016, Namu transferred Namuwiki's server management rights to a new owner, UmanLe, a company based in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. In September 2018, the site began displaying advertisements on the top banner of its pages, ostensibly to help fund its server rental fees. Content = Articles = Like its predecessor Rigveda Wiki, Namuwiki's articles are lightly worded and humorous, often containing jokes or references to subculture knowledge from various areas, including movies, games, and online memes. It has a unique form of narrative through the use of strikethroughs, which are primarily applied to sentences that are written as part of a tongue-in-cheek joke. Bolding is used liberally, often to highlight an important phrase. Although the primary focus of articles is placed on popular subcultures (the original targeted material of Rigveda Wiki) like games, anime, and movies, there are also many articles written on the fields of science, history, scholarship, and current events. However, less emphasis is placed on creating verifiable information; Namuwiki acknowledges on its behalf that its comparatively lax editing policies can cause material to be written incorrectly, biased, or defamatory, especially given a smaller number of contributors. As a result, the articles on Namuwiki are considered to be less scholarly than the likes of the Korean Wikipedia. The tone of Namuwiki is also much lighter, as it allows jokes and puns. Content of Namuwiki is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- ShareAlike 2.0 Korea (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 license). As of February 2019, Namuwiki contained approximately 636,667 main articles and over 1,400,530 files. = Projects = Namuwiki contains over 100 projects in various areas. Areas that it cover include games, transportation, military, sports, history, education, etc. As of January 2019, there were a total of 72 projects in Namuwiki.  Press coverage  In March 2017, an article published by the Korean news outlet MK News detailed Namuwiki and the \\"humorous\\" writing style of its articles. The article attributed Namuwiki's growth to its accessibility and humor. However, this and its ease of editing also leads to articles with biased and unfounded opinions. In November 2018, Namuwiki was mentioned by Korean news outlet representative Junghwan Lee as a positive example for news outlets to follow in the context of fake news, explaining that information contributed online from repeated discussion, deletion, and adjustments ultimately creates truthful information. On January 9, 2019, Korean politician Haejoo Cho formally announced that he had deleted material written on his Namuwiki page, as it contained \\"false elements,\\" which resulted in political backlash. Controversies  = Administration = Umanle S.R.L.'s base of operation in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay has led to concerns over the legal venues available for Korean citizens to seek correction of information they consider harmful, given the bureaucratic difficulties in handling legal matters with a foreign entity under foreign law. Various hypotheses have arisen to speculate the motivation behind the wiki's transfer, the most prominent of which characterizes the move as an attempt to avoid sensitive South Korean internet laws. No information has been revealed about Umanle S.R.L., its employees, or its owner(s). Data from Paraguay's Ministry of Finance confirms its existence, but little else exists to serve as any decisive evidence against the rising suspicions of a dummy corporation. Although Namuwiki's license is non- commercial, Umanle S.R.L. is classified as a for-profit corporation; September 2018 saw the deployment of advertisements on the top banner of each article, justified by the need to cover server costs. However, as Umanle S.R.L. has declined requests to reveal advertisement profit statistics, there are rising questions to this claim, to the non-commercial license of Namuwiki and any prospective violations thereof. =\\"Gender equalism\\"= In August 2016, one Namuwiki user created an article about \\"equalism\\". The article falsely claimed that a new ideology, \\"equalism\\", has appeared in the West, and made multiple remarks against feminist ideologies. As South Korea was seeing heated online debates about radical feminist website Megalia during this time, the article quickly gained a lot of attraction and contributions. Although most of the assertions and reference included in the article were false or fabricated, contents of it were widely spread over Korean society, resulting in false articles about the concept of equalism. Around the same time, the Wikipedia article on egalitarianism was also altered to favor inclusion of \\"equalism\\", which was quickly removed. The false article existed for longer than 6 months, until the country's Feminist wiki called Femiwiki brought forward specific and definite arguments on January 24, 2017. Soon, it was proved that most of the claims were false, and the original idea of equalism was mostly a fabrication. Later, the disputed article was rewritten at length and was renamed to \\"Namuwiki Gender Equalism Fabrication Case\\". = Lack of accuracy and neutrality = Despite being the largest wiki in the Korean language, Namuwiki does not necessarily require sources, nor does it have strict restrictions on contributions containing inaccurate information or subjective perspectives; it is only \\"recommended\\" to leave citations in cases of direct quotes. Due to no requirements for fact-checking, Namuwiki has been criticized for lack of accuracy and reliability. Many entries have also been criticized for lack of neutrality to minority groups or women and how they are often written in a misogynistic or homophobic manner.

All 52 seats in the South Australian House of Assembly were up for election. Since the inaugural 1857 election, no parties or solid groupings had been formed, which resulted in frequent changes of the Premier. If for any reason the incumbent Premier of South Australia lost sufficient support through a successful motion of no confidence at any time on the floor of the house, he would tender his resignation to the Governor of South Australia, which would result in interested members declaring their intent to run for the vacant position.

However, from this election there began a growing informal division between groups of members who were loosely described as ‚Äòconservative‚Äô and ‚Äòradical‚Äô by the press. The ‚Äòconservatives‚Äô found their leaders in John Cox Bray and John William Downer, while the ‚Äòradicals‚Äô were led by John Colton, Thomas Playford and John Cockburn.

He was one of the best two-year-olds in Europe in 1982 when he won his last four races including the Royal Lodge Stakes and the William Hill Futurity. He was an early favourite for the following year's Epsom Derby but was beaten in all three of his races in 1983. He later raced with no success in the United States and was retired to stud at the end of the 1984 season. He had little impact as a breeding stallion. Background Dunbeath was a bay horse with a narrow white blaze bred in Kentucky by Eaton Farms Inc & Red Bull Stable. He was sired by Grey Dawn, a French stallion best known for beating Sea-Bird in the 1964 Grand Crit√©rium. As a breeding stallion, the best of his offspring included Vigors, Heavenly Cause, Christmas Past and Grey Classic. Dunbeath's dam Priceless Fame won two minor races before becoming a successful broodmare, also producing the Del Mar Futurity winner Saratoga Six. She was a full-sister to the Kentucky Derby winner Bold Forbes. As a yearling in September 1981, Dunbeath was consigned to the Keeneland sale and was sold for $100,000. He entered the ownership of Michael Doyle Riordan and was sent to Europe where he entered training with Henry Cecil at the Warren Place stable in Newmarket. Racing career =1982: two- year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Dunbeath contested the Plantation Maiden Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in early July. After looking very relaxed and lazy in the preliminaries he finished three quarters of a length second to St Boniface, with Muscatite in third. Later that month he opened his winning account in the Foxhall Maiden Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse over the same distance, beating Morcon easily by two lengths. At York Racecourse in September he won over seven furlongs, taking the lead two furlongs out, accelerating clear of his rivals and winning by four lengths from Tobina's Guest despite being eased down in the closing stages. At the end of the month the colt was moved up in class and distance for the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse. Ridden by Lester Piggott he started the 5/2 favourite ahead of the Guy Harwood-trained Lyphard's Special and St Boniface. After settling at the rear of the field, he moved forward in the straight, took the lead inside the last quarter mile and won by one and a half lengths from Lyphard's Special with The Noble Player in third place. A month after his win at Ascot, Dunbeath started 4/7 favourite for the Group One William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. His participation had been in doubt as he had suffered an allergic reaction to a new batch of oats two days before the race, leading to swelling in his legs. Lyphard's Special was again in opposition, as well as Muscatite, the Gran Criterium runner-up Beldale Concorde and the previously undefeated Cock Robin. Piggott restrained the colt at the back of the field as Muscatite and the outsider Shackle Pin set the pace before making rapid progress in the straight. He took the lead approaching the final furlong, opened up a three length advantage, and was then eased down by Piggott to win by a length and a half from Cock Robin with Lyphard's Special in third. After the Futurity, Dunbeath was bought by Sheikh Mohammed for a reported fee of ¬£6 million. He entered the winter as the ante-post favourite for the 1983 Epsom Derby. =1983: three-year-old season= Dunbeath began his second season in the Heathorn Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in April. He was rumoured to be less than fully fit and finished a length second to the Michael Stoute-trained Shearwalk, to whom he was conceding five pounds in weight. Despite his defeat, the colt maintained his position at the head of the betting for the Derby. When he contested the Dante Stakes over ten and a half furlongs on soft ground at York Racecourse in May he was made the 1/2 favourite although his appearance was less impressive than usual as he sweated heavily in the pre- race paddock. After moving up to challenge the leaders early in the straight he began to struggle and faded to finish third behind Hot Touch and Guns of Navarone, beaten more than eleven lengths by the winner. Piggott felt that the colt had failed to stay the distance and Dunbeath did not run in the Derby. On his next appearance he was brought back to one mile for the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Ascot in June and finished third of the seven runners behind Horage and Tolomeo. In August 1983 it was announced that Dunbeath would be sent to race in North America and would enter the stable of Charles E. Whittingham. He was expected to be rested for the remainder of the season and then prepared for the 1984 Arlington Million. =1984: four-year-old season= In 1984 Dunbeath raced exclusively in California where he failed to recover his European form. He recorded two second places and one third in nine attempts, running mainly in allowance races. His only run in a Graded stakes race came in the San Bernardino Handicap at Santa Anita Park in April when he finished fifth behind Journey At Sea. Assessment In the official International Classification for 1982, Dunbeath was rated the fifth-best two- year-old in Europe behind Diesis, Saint Cyrien, Danzatore and Gorytus. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 127, six pounds inferior to Diesis, who was their top-rated juvenile. He was rated 115 by Timeform in 1983. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Dunbeath returned to Europe to become a breeding stallion. He stood in Britain and France before being exported to the Czech Republic. His last reported foals were born in 1997. The best of his flat runners was probably Radwell, who won the Solario Stakes in 1990. His offspring had some success under National Hunt rules and included the Great Yorkshire Chase winner Carbisdale. Pedigree *Dunbeath was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Blenheim, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Pillai is recognized as a pioneer of the Tamil theatre arts by the Indian Heritage Board due to his contributions to the Tamil theater in Singapore and Malaya in the 1930s-1950s. He acted, wrote plays, and staged over 60 productions for Tamil audiences. Pillai helped preserve Tamil culture and language during the colonial era, the Japanese Occupation and the post Japanese period.Varathan, S. \\"‡Æö‡Æø‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÇ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æü‡Æï‡Æï‡Øç ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Øà ‡Æµ‡Æ≥‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§ ‡Æ®‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç\\". Singapore Indian Artistes‚Äô Association, 1991, p. 36. Early life  Thiruchirappalli Mathanavelu Pillai was born to Thiruchirappalli Maruthaiya Pillai in 1906 in Tiruchirappalli, British India into a landlord's family that owned agricultural lands. He lost his parents at a young age and was left in the care of his sister. At age 9, when his sister was betrothed, Pillai was enrolled in a touring street theatre company. He received formal training in acting, dancing, singing Carnatic music, playing Indian instruments such as the harmonium, kanjira and the morsing. Later he joined the Kathar Batcha Drama Troupe where he learnt to engineer the mechanics of grandeur props and sets. He also trained in the Indian martial arts silambatam, a mandatory exercise that served dual purposes such as to portray some of the characters in the battle scenes, por kala koothu.Ragini Devi (2002). Dance Dialects of India. Motilal Banarsidass. pp 196-199Banham, Martin; Brandon, James R. (1997). The Cambridge guide to Asian theatre. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. p112. and to protect the camp site of the touring drama troupe, during their travels. Pillai arrived in Malaya-Singapore in 1925 with the Troupe. The decision to stay in Malaya marked the beginning of his extensive theatrical career. =Family= Pillai married Jeyaletchumi Thiruchirappalli Ponnusamy Pillai in Malaya-Singapore. She was known as Jeyamani by the British. She was the main liaison officer for their company with the British plantation owners due to her proficiency in the language. She also managed the costume and make up matters for the productions and acted in a few stage productions. Jeyamani also provided first aid to the company as she was from a family of Ayurvedic practitioners and healers. The couple had an elder son, T. P. Subramaniam and a younger daughter, T. P. Devaki. Pillai named the Devaki Dramatic Troupe.Varathan, S., Hamid, S. \\"‡Æö‡Æø‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÇ‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æü‡Æï ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡Æ±‡ØÅ 1935 ‚Äì 2007\\". Singapore Indian Artistes‚Äô Association, 2008, pp. 33‚Äì37. after his daughter. When Pillai retired, Devaki who was married by then was referred to as Devi Maniam and succeeded him as owner of what was now Devi Productions. Theatrical career Pillai acted, scripted his dramas, managed and staged several street theatre or terukkuttu. Terukkuttu.Mills, Margaret H.; Claus, Peter J.; Diamond, Sarah (2003). and later contemporary drama productions, under his Devaki Dramatic Troupe in Singapore and Malaya between the pre-Japanese Occupation years, 1925 to 1959 as documented in the commendation letters that were issued by the British, handbills, drama posters and other memorabilia over a period of 28 years of service to the theatre arts with an inclination towards contemporary dramas during the post-colonial years. Pillai was also invited to play the harmonium or manage productions for aspiring companies due to his versatility in theatre arts. =Plays and performances= Pillai was an avid reader and an enthused playwright, who dramatized Hindu epics and characters of Vedic puranas, famous Indian folklores told as early as the 12th century for his drama productions. Some of these tales and biographical characters were adapted and expanded from other non-Tamil Indian literature and novels for stage presentations such as Chandrakanta a literature adaptation from an 1888 fantasy novel written in Hindi by Devaki Nandan Khatri. Pillai's plays were staged on temporary proscenium stages in the rubber and coconut estates throughout 1930s-1950s, which were set up prior the performances and dismantled after the last show. Earlier all the roles were played by men who had good performing skills and rendered the story through dialogues, soliloquy, singing and dancing and assuming female roles as per tradition.Krishna Chaitanya (1990). Arts of India. Abhinav Pubns. The performances only started late in the evenings around 9.00pm and ended wee hours in the morning.Varadpande, Manohar Laxman (1990). History of Indian Theatre. Abhinav Pubns. p-21-57 And due to his vast musical knowledge, it was common for some of his musical compositions to be set according to the music tradition of composing music pieces based on ragas corresponding to the time, season and emotions (navarasas) whenever possible. A distinct signature of Mathaavelu Pillai's productions was that at the beginning of the play all the actors enter the stage singing, which not only gave a preview of the cast but also created a visual spectacle of the costumes adorned and the scenes and sets under the gas lights and fire torches lit along the performing arena. He had staged and performed as the Rajapart (lead protagonist of the play) and Kattiyangaaran (The storyteller who introduces the play) and as a lead vocalist and instrumentalist (harmonium player) in various genres: Religious tales - Alli-Arjuna., Valli Thirumanam, Bama Vijayam, Nanthnar, Dhurva Sarithram, Ramayanam, Skanda Leela, Kaalava Rishi, Lanka Thaganam, Krishna Leela, Mayil Ravanan, Dasavatharam, Vishnu Leela, Lava Kusa, Dropathai, Arjunan Thabasu, Sri Valli, Markandeyar, Indra Sabha, Vasthirabaranam, Folklore / Literature / Historical ‚Äì Rani Lalithangi, Pavalakodi, Kovalan, Mayana Kandam-Harichandran, Kalidas, Sakunthala, Sathyavan Savithri, Sataram, Baktha Ramdas, Mani Maligai, Haridas, Raja Raja Cholan., Ambigapathi, Ali Badusha, Kandi Raja, Desingu Raja, Madurai Veeran, Athiroopa Amaravathi, Sathi Sulochana, Jida Manthiri Fantasy ‚Äì Alavuddin, Kulei Bagavali, Chandra Kantha, Nationalistic themed dramas (1942) ‚Äì Baratham, Desiya Kodi Modernism / Contemporary ‚Äì Thooku thooki, Rajisha Nadasha, Raja Boss, Boologa Rambai, Bombay Mail, Vidhi, Yen Thangai, Parasakthi, Thuli Visham, Gnana Sundari, Pathi Bakthi, Nalla Thangaal, Leelavathi, Inba Kanavu During the Japanese invasion in 1942, Pillai staged nationalistic dramas to convey Gandhi‚Äôs independence movement messages of Indian self-rule to the Tamils in Malaya ‚ÄìSingapore who were widely affected by the political changes in India. Thus he used drama as a tool to bridge nationalistic sentiments and also bring home closer to the Tamils. In the 1950s, the gradual shift in the educational, social and economic status of the local Tamil speaking Indians led to the inclusion of appreciation for contemporary dramas widely together with traditional themed dramas in designated drama theatres such as Victoria theatre and New theatre and not in makeshift proscenium stages where audiences sat on the ground or less apt badminton hall. Although shows were ticketed at affordable prices, there are complimentary counterfoils that show that those who could not afford were issued complimentary tickets to enjoy the theatre arts. Although the traditional street theatre consisted of male actors, contemporary dramas in the late 1930s, included female artists in lead roles like Pillai's daughter, Devaki Mathanavelu Pillai.  Accolades and written commendations = British commendation memorandums= Pillai received 14 commendation letters from the British over a period of 15 years from 1939 to 1954 for excellence in staging productions that were appreciated by the plantation estate workers. Among them, one commendation memorandum is written to appreciate his service in training 15 untrained young men and staging a play successfully. = Open Public Challenges Potta Potti = There were companies who had challenged Pillai, in harmonium playing challenges, which required opponents to create musical song pieces, as a rebuttal to the opponents piece which would contain a question or a challenge in the song. Defeat is accepted by the one who runs out of ideas to rebut the challenge, in front of a live audience. Pillai won medals. and defeated many companies who had challenged him. Eventually he found the challenges meaningless to prove his literacy in theatre arts, thus refrained in personally attending them and sent his senior student to attend to them. Charitable efforts In aid of the Iqbal Men's Library, Pillai staged the drama, ‚ÄòInba Kanavu‚Äô and donated all the proceeds as charity. Food was always served from Pillai's personal kitchen for all the actors out of goodwill. Even when the actors were not acting and were running low in funds, Pillai gave them food.  Memorabilia Archival Currently 41 items pertaining to Pillai are on loan to the Indian Heritage Centre in Singapore. National Heritage Board, Singapore. As a pioneer contributor to the arts in Singapore his medals. all the British commendation letters addressed to him, production posters, handbills, glass plate and his photographs are available for public viewing at the Indian Heritage Centre.

He has been a finalist in five out of eleven World Cup meets throughout his shooting career, and later became the Pan American Games rifle prone champion in 2015, securing him a quota place on the host nation's team for Rio 2016. Apart from his marksmanship success, Rippel serves as a military officer of the Brazilian Army and trains for the Brazilian national team under head coach Oleg Mykhaylov, a two-time Olympic rifle shooter representing Ukraine (1996 and 2000). Rippel began to shoot rifle at the age of seventeen upon his admission to Agulhas Negras Military Academy in Resende, Rio de Janeiro. After graduating from the Academy in 1999, Rippel was invited to join the Brazilian Army, where he had undergone basic and infantry training for full-bore military rifle. In 2003, he started to compete for the Brazilian national team in Olympic small-bore rifle shooting, but put his sporting duties on a six-year adjournment instead to focus on his post- graduate studies and complete the master's degree in military science at the Academy. Rippel made his international debut at the 2012 ISSF World Cup meet in Milan, Italy, finishing thirty-fourth in the 50 m rifle prone with a prelims score of 591. When ISSF had changed its rules to the competition format at the start of the 2013 season, Rippel managed to improve his lifetime best scores of 625.3 and 626.0 in the 50 m rifle prone at the ISSF World Cup series, briefly landing him into the top five position twice in the final round with a 143.4 and a remarkable 144.9. Because of his early successes to the sport, Rippel was elected the Best Shooter of the Year by the Brazilian Olympic Committee. At the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto, Rippel fired a fantastic 207.7 to set the final meet record and claim the first gold medal ever of his shooting career in the 50 m rifle prone, prevailing over the U.S. shooter and defending Pan American Games champion Michael McPhail by a 2.2-point advantage. Rippel's victory also gave the Brazilians a berth for the host nation at the upcoming 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

It is a small shrub with narrow, hairy, clustered leaves, with violet to purple flowers and is restricted to a small area in central Queensland. Description Eremophila hispida is a compact shrub usually growing to a height of less than with its branches mostly covered with a dense layer of hairs. Its leaves are densely clustered at the ends of the branches, mostly long, less than wide, linear in shape, usually densely covered in hairs and have their edges turned under. They also have a distinct midrib visible on the lower surface. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a very short stalk. There are 5 green, hairy, overlapping, tapering, lance-shaped to triangular sepals which are mostly long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is purple to violet-coloured, the outside of the tube is usually hairy while the inner surface of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed within the petal tube. The fruits are oval-shaped with a glabrous, papery covering and are long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (hispida) is a Latin word meaning \\"with rough hair or bristles\\". Distribution and habitat Eremophila hispida grows in mulga and Corymbia terminalis woodland in brown loam and sand, mostly near Winton. Conservation Eremophila hispida is classified as \\"of least concern\\" in terms of the Queensland Nature Conservation Act. Use in horticulture This eremophila has rarely been cultivated but its purple flowers and contrasting leaves indicate that it may have potential as a garden plant. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting and grown in well-drained soil in full sun. It is drought tolerant, needing only occasional watering but it needs to be protected from frost.

He held a judiciary office in the pr√©sidial of his lifelong hometown of N√©rac. As a hobbyist, he was a polymath scientist until specialising in electricity.Luis Figuier: Les merveilles de la science ou Description populaire des inventions modernes. Furne, Jouvet et C., 1867. digitized original He became known for physical experiments during thunderstorms and in 1750 proposed a connection between lightning and electricity when the chateau of Tampouy was hit by lightning strike. That same year, he invented a device with which he tried to measure atmospheric voltage. His colleague Fran√ßois de Vivens (1697‚Äì1780) of Clairac proposed to call the device a brontom√®tre (from Greek Œ≤œÅŒ≠Œºœâ: thunder). Also in 1750, Denis Barberet published about the supposed connection between lightning and electricity. T1- d539 - Fig. 270. ‚Äî Le c√©nacle scientifique du ch√¢teau de Clairac ; Montesquieu et le Baron de Secondat, son fils, le chevalier de Vivens, Romas et les fr√®res Dutilh The same decade, Romas conducted the kite experiment that Benjamin Franklin proposed in 1750 in a letter to Peter Collinson, but that had not yet reached France. Raising a wire-wrapped kite in a thunderstorm, Romas proved the electrical nature of lightning. During his experiment, he noticed ten feet long sparks and explosions. He also reported that during a repeat performance in front of a larger audience, he received severe jolts that were more intense than all he received before during experiments with Leyden jars. For this reason, he performed later experiments only with separately grounded conductors and kites that he handled via glass rods. On 12 July 1752, he wrote a letter to the acad√©mie of Bordeaux with a first report about his experiences with a grounded rod during a lightning storm. On 14 May 1753, his first kite experiment is said to have taken place with locals as his only audience. Other reports tell of his first public experiments on 7 July 1753 on a road near N√©rac.Histoire de l‚Äô√©lectricit√©. La d√©couverte du paratonnerre. The particulars of his experiments were however often confused later, and the encyclopedia of Chassang simply states that his experiments took place ‚Äûsince 1757‚Äú.Marie-Nicolas Bouillet, Alexis Chassang: Dictionnaire universel d‚Äôhistoire et de g√©ographie Bouillet Chassang, Paris 1878. It is also reported that he installed lightning rods later in the 1750s in his home region. Unlike many intellectuals of his era, the amateur physicist didn't travel much out of his home region. When he was made a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1764 to honor his electrical kite experiments, he went to Paris. For that purpose, he had to prove that his experiments were conducted without knowledge of the similar breakthroughs of Franklin in the English colonies. The commission acknowledged this after studying his reports and letters to different fellow scientists. In 1911, a 300 kg bronze statue in his honor was erected in N√©rac, inaugurated by French president Armand Falli√®res. It was put down and smeltered in 1942 during the German occupation, but a replica was set up at the original site on 13 February 2010.La D√©p√™che du Midi: Jacques de Romas retrouve son pi√©destal A school and several streets in the region are named after Romas.

He was the grandson of John Brown (1722-1787), the renowned Scottish theologian and author. John Croumbie Brown received his education in Aberdeen, was later trained as a missionary, and in 1833 was sent to St. Petersburg by the London Missionary Society to mission to the British and American Church, spending four years there. From 1844 to 1848 he was in Cape Town where he took charge of the Congregational Church. Having an easy familiarity with the natural sciences, he presented a series of public lectures on scientific topics. His first lecture in November 1844 was under the aegis of the Cape Town Mental Improvement Society and was \\"On the discoveries of modern astronomy\\". This was followed by lectures on chemistry sponsored by the Institute for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. In 1847 he delivered lectures \\"On the physiology and structure of the human frame\\" - these lectures were subsequently published in book form in Cape Town. Returning to Scotland, Brown served as pastor in Aberdeen in 1849, continuing with his scientific lectures, which were well received. He furthered his botanical studies, and in April 1853 took up the post of lecturer in botany at the Joint Medical School (King's College, Aberdeen), also being awarded the degree Doctor of Laws there in 1858. In April 1863, following the death of Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Pappe, Brown took up the post of Colonial Botanist at the Cape, his duties including that of professor of botany at the South African College. He toured the Cape Colony during 1863, giving lectures in an effort to popularise botany. He opposed deforestation and veld-burning, because of the loss of soil moisture. He was consulted by the government on forestry matters, and wrote several memoirs on forestry, appending a list of South African trees, shrubs, and arborescent herbs, to his annual report for 1866. His reports also touched on agricultural issues, such as diseases in fruit trees, rust, manuring, the cultivation of various crops, experimental farms, irrigation, and Cape wines. His 1863 report included the first official record of \\"krimpsiekte\\" or Cotyledonosis in small stock, particularly goats, caused by three genera of the Crassulaceae (Cotyledon, Tylecodon and Kalanchoe).http://www.afrivip.org/sites/default/files/07_cumulative.pdf He investigated potential dam sites, and the hydrology of the country. In 1866 the post of Colonial Botanist was abolished due to shortage of funds and Brown returned to Scotland in January 1867. Some South African botanists were critical of Brown's contributions to botanical knowledge, but the noted Irish botanist William Henry Harvey singled out Brown for praise in the preface to Volume 3 of the Flora Capensis \\"for his unremitting kind attention to the interests of this work, and for the zeal which he has shown, since his appointment, in endeavouring to promote the study of botany in all parts of the Colony, and among the neighbouring extra-colonial missionaries\\". The Cape authorities also valued his suggestions, some of which were implemented. Hence he was not regarded as an outstanding botanist, but did successfully promote interest in botany and sound methods in agriculture, forestry, and veld management. Brown maintained his interest in the forestry and hydrology of the Cape Colony, publishing a number of valuable works. In April 1877 he addressed the Town Council of Edinburgh and the board of the Royal Scottish Arboricultural Society, advocating the establishment of a forestry school and arboretum in Edinburgh. Various unpublished manuscripts on South African agriculture, forestry and botany were lodged with the Faculty of Forestry at the University of Stellenbosch by his grandson, Dr. Eric A. Nobbs.

By the time he was 13 frontiers had moved and Breslau was rapidly becoming Wroc≈Çaw, ethnically and politically part of Poland. Between 1946 and 1950 Dietrich lived in Wittenberg within the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, where he undertook an apprenticeship in the art of wood carving. This was followed by a period of study at the Wood carving Academy in Empfertshausen (1950‚Äì1952), and two or three years of further study at the College of Applied Arts at Leipzig (1952‚Äì1954). At Leipzig he was taught by and Alfred Thiele. After this he moved on to the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts where he was taught by and Walter Arnold. Between 1958 and 1964 Dietrich worked as a freelance artist based in Dresden, teaming up at one point in a shared workshop with Wieland F√∂rster. In 1964 he relocated to the north coast, living at Kneese (Bad S√ºlze), a short distance outside Rostock on its eastern side. He stayed in the Rostock area for nearly four decades, and it was here that he had his most productive years. Several of his works can be found on public display in and around Rostock. Some of the work from his Rostock years was produced in collaboration with Jo Jastram (1928‚Äì2011).

In mathematical optimization, affine scaling is an algorithm for solving linear programming problems. Specifically, it is an interior point method, discovered by Soviet mathematician I. I. Dikin in 1967 and reinvented in the U.S. in the mid-1980s. History Affine scaling has a history of multiple discovery. It was first published by I. I. Dikin at Energy Systems Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences (Siberian Energy Institute, USSR Academy of Sc. at that time) in the 1967 Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, followed by a proof of its convergence in 1974. Dikin's work went largely unnoticed until the 1984 discovery of Karmarkar's algorithm, the first practical polynomial time algorithm for linear programming. The importance and complexity of Karmarkar's method prompted mathematicians to search for a simpler version. Several groups then independently came up with a variant of Karmarkar's algorithm. E. R. Barnes at IBM, a team led by R. J. Vanderbei at AT&T;, and several others replaced the projective transformations that Karmarkar used by affine ones. After a few years, it was realized that the \\"new\\" affine scaling algorithms were in fact reinventions of the decades-old results of Dikin. Of the re-discoverers, only Barnes and Vanderbei et al. managed to produce an analysis of affine scaling's convergence properties. Karmarkar, who had also came with affine scaling in this timeframe, mistakenly believed that it converged as quickly as his own algorithm. Algorithm Affine scaling works in two phases, the first of which finds a feasible point from which to start optimizing, while the second does the actual optimization while staying strictly inside the feasible region. Both phases solve linear programs in equality form, viz. :minimize :subject to , . These problems are solved using an iterative method, which conceptually proceeds by plotting a trajectory of points strictly inside the feasible region of a problem, computing projected gradient descent steps in a re-scaled version of the problem, then scaling the step back to the original problem. The scaling ensures that the algorithm can continue to do large steps even when the point under consideration is close to the feasible region's boundary. Formally, the iterative method at the heart of affine scaling takes as inputs , , , an initial guess that is strictly feasible (i.e., ), a tolerance and a stepsize . It then proceeds by iterating * Let be the diagonal matrix with on its diagonal. * Compute a vector of dual variables: *: w^k = (A D_k^2 A^\\\\operatorname{T})^{-1} A D_k^2 c. * Compute a vector of reduced costs, which measure the slackness of inequality constraints in the dual: *: r^k = c - A^\\\\operatorname{T} w^k. * If r^k > 0 and \\\\mathbf{1}^\\\\operatorname{T} D_k r^k < \\\\varepsilon, the current solution is -optimal. * If -D_k r^k \\\\ge 0, the problem is unbounded. * Update x^{k+1} = x^k - \\\\beta \\\\frac{D_k^2 r^k}{\\\\D_k r^k\\\\} =Initialization= Phase I, the initialization, solves an auxiliary problem with an additional variable and uses the result to derive an initial point for the original problem. Let be an arbitrary, strictly positive point; it need not be feasible for the original problem. The infeasibility of is measured by the vector :v = b - Ax^0. If , is feasible. If it is not, phase I solves the auxiliary problem :minimize :subject to , , . This problem has the right form for solution by the above iterative algorithm, and :\\\\begin{pmatrix} x^0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} is a feasible initial point for it. Solving the auxiliary problem gives :\\\\begin{pmatrix} x^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ u^* \\\\end{pmatrix}. If , then is feasible in the original problem (though not necessarily strictly interior), while if , the original problem is infeasible. Analysis While easy to state, affine scaling was found hard to analyze. Its convergence depends on the step size, . For step sizes , Vanderbei's variant of affine scaling has been proven to converge, while for , an example problem is known that converges to a suboptimal value. Other variants of the algorithm have been shown to exhibit chaotic behavior even on small problems when .

No.1 signalbox - since demolished - can be seen. Lowca village is on the centre hilltop, the colliery etc. were to the village's left. The halt was to the right of what looks like a gas holder below the pit site. The Gilgarran Branch curved right up the valley below Lowca village. The coast line curves left round the headland. Parton Halt railway station was opened by the LNWR and FR Joint Railway (\\"The Joint Line\\") in January 1915 and closed by the LMSR fourteen years later in 1929. The halt never appeared on any public timetable, as it was provided to enable workmen to get from to the isolated colliery, coke ovens and bi-products plant on the hilltop at Lowca. The halt was at the foot of steep tracks up to these workplaces. Location The line past the halt is clearly shown on standard railway maps, but the halt eludes them all; however, it is shown on contemporary OS maps.The halt on a 1927 OS map via National Library of ScotlandThe halt on a 1937 OS map via National Library of Scotland It is not to be confused with which in 2015 remained on the Cumbrian Coast Line to the south of the site of the halt. Further research is needed to establish the physical nature of the halt, such structures in many parts of the country were very rudimentary. History The halt was on the WCER's Gilgarran Branch, occasionally referred to as the Gilgarron Branch. The company and the branch were fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century. All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, few more so than the Gilgarran Branch. Many iron mines, quarries, collieries and attendant works were situated in inaccessible areas with low populations, making workmen's trains a natural add-on service. Lowca had a workmen's service - and for a shorter period an advertised passenger service - from the north along the clifftops provided by the Lowca Light Railway in conjunction with the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway (CWJR). The service to Parton Halt met the same need from the south. Services No Sunday passenger service was provided. A passenger service from to Whitehaven along the Gilgarran Branch had run from 1881 to 1883, but it was not a success and was withdrawn. A Thursdays and Saturdays only (Market Days) service was run from Distington to Whitehaven, calling or changing at from autumn 1913 (sources disagree whether from October or November) to September 1914, these trains passed the site of the future Parton Halt, but served a different purpose. The initial service, which started on 11 January 1915, can be seen on the attached Working Time table (WTT) extract. Service times were set to match shift changes at the colliery and associated works. This was a common pattern with such halts across the country. Goods traffic passed the halt, but did not call. The April 1917 Working Time Table shows three Up mineral trains travelling a mile beyond the halt to No 4 Pit and two travelling beyond to Distington Ironworks, with an extra on Saturdays, all matched by Down trains. The line past the site of the halt went on to become a late survivor on the West Cumberland scene. The colliery at Lowca wound coal until 1968, feeding the associated works. After it closed coal continued to come from Solway Colliery, Workington until it closed in 1973, at which point the surviving business for the bi-product works and coal washery at Lowca was handled by road. The end products from Lowca were taken away northwards along the clifftops using the surviving parts of the Lowca Light Railway. Incoming coal from Solway Colliery was worked south along the coast line to Parton, where the train reversed up the Gilgarron Branch, past the site of the halt to a junction known as \\"Bain's Siding\\" where it ran forward up the side of the valley to Lowca, effecting a zig-zag to gain the necessary height. Until 1968 at least, coal was also wound at No.4 Pit near Bain's Siding and taken down the branch past the site of the halt. Rundown and closure The halt closed in 1929, with buses able to provide a more attractive door-to-workplace gate service. The line past its site closed in May 1973. Nearby sidings were retained for many more years for Civil Engineers, but have since been lifted. Afterlife By 2013 most of the trackbed through the halt had been obliterated. Further towards Distington the Gilgarran Branch's route had been recycled as a public cycleway.

After repeatedly requesting for a combat post, Lomakin was appointed commander of the 195th Tank Brigade of the 15th Tank Corps, part of the 3rd Guards Tank Army, on 15 June 1943. The 3rd Guards Tank Army was sent into battle at Kursk to reinforce the Bryansk Front. On 17 July, the army began to advance and was 10 kilometers from Oleshnya. The army was ordered to break through German defences and develop the offensive in the southwest. After the artillery barrage and air strikes, the army attacked. The tanks crossed the Oleshnya River, but the 113th Tank Brigade encountered stubborn resistance. The 195th Tank Brigade was then sent into combat. Finding a gap in the German defences, the brigade moved forward across the Oleshnya. From 19 to 22 July, Lomakin personally led the brigade. In this period, the brigade reportedly destroyed 20 tanks, 25 guns, 7 self-propelled guns, 60 trucks and 3 warehouses. The brigade also reportedly wiped out two German battalions. On 22 July, the brigade encountered entrenched German troops in the village of Semyonovka in Zalegoshchensky District. Lomakin concluded that the village could only be taken with a flank attack. The 1st and 2nd Tank Battalions of the brigade were ordered to attack. The two battalions cut off the village. Lomakin ordered the 3rd Tank Battalion to conduct a frontal attack. In his command tank, Lomakin participated in the attack. The German troops laid down a heavy artillery barrage, one of the shells hitting Lomakin's tank. The entire crew was wounded and Lomakin decided not to leave the tank. The second German shell hit the tank and it caught fire, killing the crew along with Lomakin. Lomakin was buried in the village.

The original French version Le Fond de la Bouteille, written in 1948 when Simenon was living in Arizona, appeared in 1949. The novel is among his romans durs, a term roughly translated as hard, or harrowing, novels; it was used by Simenon for what he regarded as his serious literary works.Carter, David. The Pocket Essential Georges Simenon. The Pocket Essentials, 2003. The story is set in Arizona near the Mexican border: a rancher's life is disrupted by the appearance of his brother, who has escaped from jail and is determined to get across the Santa Cruz River to Mexico. Summary Patrick Martin Ashbridge, known as P.M., is a lawyer and rancher in Arizona near the border with Mexico. Returning home from a bar as rain ends a dry period, he discovers his brother Donald by his ranch. P.M. has not seen him for a long time and hardly knows his recent life. He read in newspapers that Donald was imprisoned for wounding a police officer; he also had letters about him from their sister Emily, who has a career in Los Angeles. Don has escaped from Joliet Prison and wants to cross the Santa Cruz River to Mexico. The river, higher because of the rain, is now impossible to cross. P.M. tells his wife Nora that Don is his friend Eric Bell, who has been ill and is not allowed to drink. As he talks to Don, P.M. thinks back about their early family life in poor circumstances, and the different lives of Don, Emily and himself. P.M.'s first marriage ended when he had ambitions to become a lawyer; his wealth has come from his second wife Nora. Don, despite his desperate past, seems to be critical of P.M.'s career. At a party at a neighbouring ranch, P.M. gets a phone call from Emily, who talks to Don; this increases the guests' curiosity about him. Emily gave Don money to reach Arizona and is anxious that Don should reach Nogales just over the border, where his wife Mildred and children are living in desperate circumstances. P.M. goes home with Don for him to phone Mildred, and Don starts to drink. Don has an aggressive attitude to P.M., determined that P.M. must help him across the river. Back at the party, Don, getting increasingly drunk, hits P.M. who returns with blows; they are separated, and Don disappears. Nora, on being told all about Don, says she had guessed he was P.M.'s brother. In their car, they look for him. At the Santa Cruz River, where people often drive to look at the river when it is high, they meet Falk, a neighbour who lives alone; he tells them food, alcohol and a gun were stolen from his house. P.M. hears that Don was told about a likely crossing place at Mule Pass, and he leaves home on a horse, having chosen the best one for crossing the river. He meets Falk on the way and they ride together. They find Don at the river. P.M. gives Don his horse and, borrowing Falk's horse, follows Don across: Don reaches the other side, but P.M. is swept away. Film The book was made into the 1956 film The Bottom of the Bottle, directed by Henry Hathaway and featuring Joseph Cotten as P.M., Van Johnson as Donald and Ruth Roman as Nora.

Drawing on her experience as a City CEO, mother of nine, and founder of the influential 30% Club which campaigns for gender-balanced UK company boards, her manifesto for new ways of working, living, loving and raising families is for everyone, not just women. Making a powerful case for diversity and difference in any workplace, she shows how, together, we can develop smarter thinking and broader definitions of success. Gender balance, in her view, is an essential driver of economic prosperity and part of the solution to the many problems we face today. Her approach is not aimed merely at training a few more women in working practices that have outlived their usefulness. Instead, this book sets out a way to reinvent the game ‚Äì not at the expense of men but in ways that are right and relevant for a digital age. It is a powerful guide to success for us all.\\" She was the guest on the BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs on Sunday 22 March 2020.

It was established in the United Kingdom in 2010 by Dame Helena Morrissey with the aim of achieving a minimum of 30% female representation on FTSE 100 boards. That target was reached in September 2018. The Club now also has chapters in Australia, Brazil, Canada, East Africa, GCC, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Southern Africa, Turkey and the United States. In 2015 Brenda Trenowden was appointed as the new lead for the UK chapter and as Global Chair of the campaign, reflecting its increased reach and scale since launch. As of June 2019, the leadership structure of the campaign further evolved in response to its ongoing success and international influence, with Ann Cairns joining as Global co-Chair of the campaign. The Club continues to expand its global footprint and has exceeded its original UK goal, with 32.5% women sitting on FTSE 100 Boards as at September 2019.  The approach  The 30% Club adopts a collaborative, business-led approach - it does not believe in mandatory quotas and supports a voluntary approach aimed at realizing meaningful, sustainable change. The campaign's efforts are complementary to individual company efforts and existing groups, adding to these through measurable goals, collaboration and the visible and voluntary commitment of senior business leaders. The campaign focuses on amplifying the business case for gender diversity which evidences that diverse teams make better decisions (e.g. McKinsey & Company research of 180 publicly traded companies found ROEs were 53% higher for companies ranking in the top quartile of executive board diversity than those in the bottom quartile. Similarly Credit Suisse found that companies where women made up at least 15% of senior managers had more than 50% higher profitability than those where female representation was less than 10% ).
