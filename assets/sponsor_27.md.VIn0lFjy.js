Alligator leather is also commonly used to create similar items as mentioned above. alt=FMIB 33999 Alligator Skins.jpeg Alligator leather is not only used due to its durable skin, but also its natural enamel sheen, which is aesthetically pleasing for consumers buying expensive products.  History  The earliest use of alligator skin was said to be in 1800 in North America. It was used to make boots, shoes, saddles and other products. Despite the first use being recorded in the 1800, alligator skin production increased majorly during the mid 1800s. During the American Civil War in 1855, saddles and boots were made for the Confederate troops. This led to alligator leather rising to the top of choice for leather usage. The durability and softness that we get from alligator leather today started when commercial tanning began in the early 1900s in New York, New Jersey and Europe. This brought a major increase in demand as a fashion based material. The sudden spike in demand for the leather led to alligator population decreasing in Louisiana in the mid 1900s, Louisiana being the biggest harvesting state in America. 1962 was when alligator hunting was closed statewide due to low numbers, the effect of non- regulated harvests. By 1967, alligators made the endangered species list in America however this was not for long. In the year of 1987, Alligators were no more a threat of endangerment due to the cultivation and conservation efforts that led to the number gradually increasing again.  Applications  = Handbags = Luxury brands are known to use rare and expensive materials to justify their prices. One of these sought after materials is alligator leather. One particular brand that is synonymous with high-end luxury would be Herm√®s. One of their most iconic and expensive bags ever made would be their Alligator Birkin that was priced at a staggering US$379,261 at auction. Luxury brands prefer the highest grade under belly section of the alligator, as they usually need a large piece of the hide. Lower grade alligator leather usually has scar tissue that would decrease the value of the product. An Alligator Handbag Rests on Top of an Incubator (possibly the California Alligator Farm, Los Angeles), ca.1900 (CHS-6301) = Boots or shoes = Alligator leather shoes and boots are a common sight in high-end retail stores. It also is common for the American Midwest/Cowboy market to invest in alligator Leather boots or shoes due to its durability. While high-grade leather can create exceptional quality, low-grade leather can also be pieced together to create a great product. = Clothing = Leather use for clothing dates back to 1200BC when ancient Greeks used it as a material as it was durable and helped tackle different climates. While leather is still used as a material for winter clothing, due to its rarity and exclusivity, alligator leather has become a luxury. High-end expensive brands use alligator hide for clothing items, most popular being jackets and winter wear.  Process of tanning leather  Tanning is the process of processing the raw skin of an animal to leather. If not done correctly, the skin is prone to bacteria and ultimately decomposition. The tanning process for alligator is a lengthy process. The process first starts with first obtaining the skin and depending on the final product the leather will be used for; the tanner will choose which part of the animal to use. = Extraction of skin = Depending on what the final product will be, tanneries dissect and process that portion of the alligator. For a softer and more malleable product, tanners choose to use the underbelly and perform a \\"belly cut\\". Usually younger farm raised alligators are chosen for this process as the skin is not as tough as an adult alligator. Underbelly hide is usually used for luxury products and so therefore farm raised alligators will not have scars or marks as wild alligators may have. This is due to the fact it is not raised in the wild and therefore do not encounter situations that would cause scars or damage to the skin. The \\"hornback cut\\" however is used more for the raised scaly appearance that products such as belt or boot makers desire. This is the top portion of the alligator. Older wild alligators are used for this process of leather. = Scraping = The raw hide is then scraped using usually a dull tool so that it does not penetrate or cut the skin. This removes the remaining flesh and fat on the hide. Once this is done the inner portion of the skin will look white. This however does not fully remove all flesh and fat. Once this is done, wash the skin to remove any blood or flesh residue that is attached to the skin. Leave to dry. Tanner scraping raw skin, 1609 = Dry salting = Once dry, a layer of salt is applied to all parts of the skin to completely dry it out. Drying out the skin will slow the process of decomposition. This process is usually done twice or three times. = Brining or pickling = Once the salting process is done, the hide is ready for brining. Brining is the chemical process that further enhances the curing process of the alligator. This is to remove any bacteria or elements that could attract bacteria, as that is what causes decomposition. To brine the hide, usually a mixture of bleach, borax and salt is added to water in a plastic drum. The alligator is then soaked in the solution for about 48 hours to completely remove any non-tannable proteins. An alligator = Neutralizing = For optimum tanning acidity levels (pH level 4 or 5), sodium bicarbonate is added to the pickle solution. Throughout the pickling stage, the water must be a room temperature level. The hide is then returned to the plastic drum for another 20‚Äì30 minutes. = Degreasing = Degreasing is the process of removing any left over fat from the hide so that there is no chance of oil or fat stains. This can be done with a degreasing product or heavy duty washing liquid. The hide is placed in another plastic drum with the product or washing liquid and warm water.  Tanning  Two of the most common ways to most common tanning methods and which method Alligator hide requires: = Vegetable tanning = Vegetable tanning uses the natural tannins that are found in plants, tree bark and other natural sources. This process produces brown leather that is soft and malleable. Although it is great for products such as bookbinding or early plate armour due to its softness, when in contact with water, the leather tends to shrink in size, as it is unstable. This is one of the most environmentally friendly ways to tan leather as no additional acids or chemicals are used. Peeling Hemlock Bark for Vegetable Tanning  Chromium tanned leather  Chromium tanning is the most popular tanning method as 90% of all leather in the world is processed this way. Alligator hide is also tanned using the Chromium process. A reason many tanneries choose to use chromium is due to the final leather product being more durable and stretchy, ideal for leather accessories and garments. The process includes submerging the hide in a toxic slush of chromium salts and chemicals to create a light blue product that is supple and durable. This process of tanning is done usually twice to soften the leather to its desired texture. Chromium tanning also creates a stronger product that is more resistant to water and creates less shrinkage when in contact. = Environmental impact = The environmental impact of leather, especially at the tanning process, has a mass negative effect. The waste product of tanning can be broken down into two categories.  Water waste  An enormous amount of polluted water is discharged from the tanning process. Almost 90% of pollution of the leather industry comes from the tanning and pre tanning stages of production. As a base calculation, tanning one ton of hide creates 20 to 80 cubic meters of polluted water. Due to chemicals raising the pH levels in the water, a large amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total dissolved solids (TDS). The water also shows an increase in chloride and sulphate levels. The process also uses a large number of water, which is not environmentally friendly. One example of poor disposal of wastewater can be seen in Hazaribagh, Bangladesh. Ironically Hazaribagh in Urdu translates to \\"a thousand gardens\\"; quite the contrary to what the situation is like. Despite the leather industry in Bangladesh being a 1 billion dollar industry, providing thousands of jobs to many, the environmental impact is grave. The use of chromium salts, acids and toxins have caused the Buriganga River, which runs along Hazaribagh, to turn black. An estimated 21,600 cubic meters of polluted water was disposed per day in 2005.  Solid waste  Tanneries produce a huge amount of solid waste. Generally 35-60% of the total amount of solid waste is organic matter. This consists of the flesh and organic body parts of the animal. Due to decomposition, a lack of composting or efficient disposal can cause a lot of disease and unsanitary waste. This affects groundwater systems and agricultural activities as the waste is usually dumped in landfills. = Health complications = The tanning industry not only causes detrimental environmental impact, it also creates many health complications for workers in countries without effective safety regulations and protection standards. Some of these countries are China, India and Bangladesh. The toxic exposure to the chemicals in tanneries causes skin and respiratory disease amongst workers due to the lack of safety equipment and training. Skin reaction to anthrax Tanneries that use chromium increase the chances of workers getting respiratory illnesses and can sometimes lead to lung, nasal or sinus cancer. The raw hides are also a breeding ground for anthrax left untreated this can be a potentially deadly disease. Chromium tanning also can severely destroy skin amongst workers. When the skin, due to unprotected handling absorbs chromium, it can leave the skin dry and cracked. The acidity in the tanning and liming stages can cause erosions in the skin, which is irreversible. According to a report in 2001 estimate, around 90% of workers die before the age of 50 due to health complications in Hazaribagh, Bangladesh; a well known city known for its tanning industry which has low health and safety standards.

He served at the director level for numerous charities including: the Inside Out Toronto LGBT Film and Video Festival, the YMCA, and the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network. In 2016, he became the executive director for the Rainbow Railroad, helping LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers escape countries that criminalize homosexuality, including the death penalty for being gay.  Early life and education  Powell was born and raised in Canada by Jamaican-born parents. He has a Baccalaureate in Political Science from the University of Ottawa.  Career  In 2009, Powell directed Darren Anthon‚Äôs play ‚ÄúSecrets of a Black Boy‚Äù, a series of monologues and set-pieces about issues of the black community. The play was reprised in 2016. Powell has held director-level positions at the Inside Out Toronto LGBTQ Film and Video Festival and the YMCA. He worked as a major gifts officer at Dignitas International, a Toronto-based medical and research charity organization dedicated to improving access to lifesaving treatment and care for HIV, TB and related diseases in resource-limited settings. From approximately 2012 to 2016, he was the director of development and outreach at the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, Canada's leading advocacy organization working on the legal and human rights issues raised by HIV and AIDS. In November 2016, he started as the executive director of the Rainbow Railroad, a nonprofit organization that helps LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers escape life-threatening situations because of their gender identity and sexuality. Rainbow Railroad is named in homage to the United States‚Äô 1800s Underground Railroad to help escaping African-American slaves get to free states, Canada and Nova Scotia with the aid of sympathetic abolitionists and allies. The clients are helped to ‚Äúescape from state-enabled violence, murder or persecution in their home countries‚Äù, usually from the Caribbean, Africa, and Middle East, and relocated to Europe or North America. As of 2019, seventy countries criminalize homosexuality, with eleven imposing a death penalty for being gay. Rainbow Railroad‚Äôs chair of the board of directors Michael Battista stated Powell was an ideal fit being Jamaican and a gay man with ‚Äúvery strong fundraising and development experience, work in the LGBT community, and then international advocacy with the HIV/AIDS legal network‚Äù. In 2017, reports of gay men being hunted and tortured in Chechnya compelled the group to seek funds and support to rescue the victims; Powell traveled to the area. In 2018, Powell was named to the Out100, honoring LGBTQ visionaries, for his work. In June 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, sparking the start of the modern LGBTQ rights movement, Queerty named him one of the Pride50 ‚Äútrailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people. In September 2019, Powell notes that U.S. LGBTQ refugee asylum cases are at a crisis level under Trump. Cases can go for years with no progress, and bringing ‚Äúone person to safety can cost thousands of dollars (due to transportation, paperwork, and outside-the-box routing), only to find a new set of challenges once they reach a border.‚Äù  References  Category:LGBT rights activists from Canada Category:Black Canadian LGBT people Category:Canadian theatre directors Category:Activists from Toronto Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:University of Ottawa alumni ","title":"Kimahli Powell"},{"id":"61062595","text":"Riekert Hattingh (born 5 March 1994) is a South African-born American professional rugby union player currently playing for the Seattle Seawolves in Major League Rugby (MLR) in the United States.

Their primary aim was to \\"provide artists with an organized relationship to society, to demonstrate the political effectiveness of image making, and to provide a framework within which progressive artists can discuss and develop alternatives to the mainstream art system.\\" The collective was active from around 1980 to 1988, when its 501(c)(3) non-profit status formally expired, and was based out of 339 Lafayette Street for several years. PAD/D was originally founded by Lucy Lippard, Margia Kramer, and Gregory Sholette, among others. Lucy Lippard claims that one of her early inspirations for PAD/D was the London art scene and its dedication to combining political and community art, as well the work of London-based artists like Susan Hiller and Alexis Hunter. One of its early actions was the \\"Image War on the Pentagon\\", which took place on May 3rd, 1981, and consisted of artists marching with anti-war poster designs in Washington, DC, and New York. As part of its mission, PAD/D published _UPFRONT_ , a magazine on arts and activism, and _Red Letter Days_ , \\"a calendar of leftist and activist events\\", and the collective organized exhibitions on the topics of gentrification, the US military budget, and political propaganda. The PAD/D collective also oversaw several issues of Cultural Correspondence, a publication inspired by the New Left, near the end of that magazine's existence. In 1982, PAD/D also collaborated with Cultural Correspondence to publish an audiovisual art slideshow entitled \\"We want to live! Artworks for peace, June 12, 1982\\".

It was built and operated by BBN Technologies from May 1989 to about 1991; although originally planned to turn into the Defense Research Internet, it instead evolved into the Defense Simulation Internet. The Terrestrial Wideband Network was a trans- continental network implemented via Wideband Packet Switches (based on BBN Butterfly parallel computers) connected by T1 circuits. It replaced the 3 megabit/second Satellite Wideband Network, which had been in operation for the previous 8 years. Because it was based on a single cross-country T1 trunk from the DARPA National Networking Testbed (NNT), the Terrestrial Wideband Network's topology was linear, i.e., a series of packet switches connected in a line by T1 trunks. Each T1 link ran at 1.544 megabits per second. The Terrestrial Wideband Network provided standard Internet Protocol transport, but also multicast services and the experimental, connection-oriented Internet Stream Protocol (ST-II). Individual host computers could gain access to ST-II features via the Host Access Protocol (HAP), specified in RFC 907-A. Internally, the network was based on the Dual Bus Protocol (DBP), a descendant of the QPSX protocol proposed as the IEEE 802.6 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) standard, enhanced to provide bandwidth reservations with access fairness, and to operate over long distances.

Early life Piera Fondelli was born in PoppiMiriam Mafai, Natalia Aspesi, Le Donne italiane: il chi √® del '900, Rizzoli, Milano 1993, p. 240.\\"Gatteschi Fondelli Piera\\" in Tuscany. Her father died before her birth and she moved to Rome with her mother before 1914. On March 23, 1921 she enrolled in the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento in Rome with Ines Donati with whom she attended the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma.‚ÄúStoria di Piera e delle altre squadriste‚Äù On 19 October 1922 she took part in the PNF congress held in Naples and on October 28, the twenty-year-old Piera was the head of a small group of twenty women who formed the \\"honor squad escorting the pennant\\" and with them participated in the March on Rome. She then became inspector of the Federation of the Urbe, taking care of the , of the Italian Red Cross. In 1936 she left her post to follow Count Mario Gatteschi in Italian East Africa, whom she married becoming the Countess Gatteschi Fondelli, an engineer who directed the works on the Assab-Addis Ababa road. When, three years later, she returned to Italy, Mussolini appointed her a Trustee of the Female Fasci of the City which had 150,000 members and in 1940 a national inspector for the party. After the fall of fascism on 25 July 1943, she took refuge with her in-laws in the Casentino,‚ÄúUna pagina al giorno: Vendette demoniache, di Piera Gatteschi Fondelli‚Äù while her husband, who returned to Africa as a fighter, was imprisoned by the British in Kenya. Informed that Mussolini was freed and founded the Italian Social Republic in Northern Italy, Piera moved to Brescia and started a new collaboration with Alessandro Pavolini, the party secretary. Here, at the end of 1943, Piera wrote to the Mussolini the desire of fascist women to have a more incisive role in the defense of the country, a project supported by Pavolini and accepted by Rodolfo Graziani, since many men were needed for the war and women became necessary to assist them and to replace them in the many non-front-line roles. On 18 April 1944, the Female Auxiliary Service was established. The auxiliaries initially provided only nursing assistance in military hospitals, work in offices and propaganda, and set up mobile refreshment places for the troops. In the space of twelve months 6,000 young women participate in six training courses, in Venice and Como; only then were they assigned to the Commands. After April 25, 1945 the Female Auxiliary Service was dissolved and Pavolini suggested destroying all documentation to avoid reprisals against members.\\"Storia.

It is Belgium's oldest translation school, founded in 1955, and the fifth faculty of Saint-Louis University, Brussels, which it fully merged with in 2015.  History  The √âcole sup√©rieure de jeunes filles (Higher School for Young Women) was founded by Marie Haps in 1919, with the help of Paulin Ladeuze, rector of the Catholic University of Louvain, and the support of Cardinal Mercier. The institution was established in the H√¥tel Beernaert, at rue d'Arlon 11, on the border between Brussels and Ixelles. In 1932, the Rector of the University of Louvain awarded the school the prestigious status of Fifth faculty of the Alma Mater. When Marie Haps herself died in 1939, her daughter Simone Haps took over the management of the school, a position which she held until 1961. Simone pursued the development of the institution and with the establishment of the European institutions in the neighbourhood during the 1950s, and in expectation of the needs of Expo 58,Claire Campolini- Doucet, Marie Haps de A √† Z: Cent ans d'histoire de l'Enseignement sup√©rieur en Belgique francophone (Academia/L'Harmattan, 2019), p. 280. she opened the country's first institute for translators and interpreters. During the 1960s, the Marie Haps Language Centre was opened. It became a co-educational school in 1963. The school's official name was changed to Institut libre Marie Haps, sous le patronage de l'Universit√© catholique de Louvain (Marie Haps Free Institute, under the patronage of the Universit√© catholique de Louvain), to which partenaire de la Haute √©cole L√©onard de Vinci (partner of L√©onard de Vinci College) was added in 1997; in short: Institut libre Marie Haps (ILMH). With the reorganization of higher education in the French Community of Belgium in 1995, Marie Haps was merged into Haute √âcole L√©onard de Vinci. The Centre de Terminologie de Bruxelles, which studies and advises on terminology, has been based in the institution since 1978.Magdalena Krommer-Benz, World Guide to Terminological Activities (Munich, K. G. Saur Verlag, 2012), p. 83. In 2004, Belgium's French-speaking universities were grouped into three University Academies, with the long-term objective of merging into three large universities. The Catholic universities, including the University of Louvain and Saint-Louis University, Brussels, formed the Acad√©mie Louvain, with the aim of founding a single university, UCLouvain. In the short run, plans were made to merge a series of Brussels Catholic institutes of higher education, especially IHECS, ICHEC and the Marie Haps translation-interpreting department, first into Saint-Louis University, and later into UCLouvain. From 2007 onwards, the Marie Haps Institute was able to award double bachelor and master degrees to its students together with Saint-Louis University, Brussels, allowing the department to award university degrees. Initial plans were to transfer the entire department of translation-interpreting to Saint-Louis University, then only the bachelor programmes, moving the masters in translation to Louvain-la-Neuve at the University of Louvain, and keeping the masters of interpreting in Brussels (double degrees with the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles). In 2014, a decree finally established the integration of Belgium's translation and interpreting school to universities. The Marie Haps department was split in two, with only the bachelor programmes being kept in Brussels, within the new Marie Haps Faculty of Translation and Interpreting of Saint-Louis University. Classes are held at the H√¥tel Beernaert and the Tilleul campus, both shared with the Institut libre Marie Haps which continues higher education in other fields. All masters programmes have been transferred to Louvain-la-Neuve, founding the Louvain School of Translation and Interpreting (LSTI) within UCLouvain's Faculty of Philosophy, Arts and Letters. In 2014, the European Commission awarded its prestigious European Master's in Translation label to Marie Haps. The same year, the Faculty launched a bachelor programme in translation and interpreting of sign language, the only one in Belgium, inaugurated by Minister Jean-Claude Marcourt.  Description  = Studies = The faculty organises 12 different bachelor programmes in translation and interpreting, all composed of three languages: French; English or German; and one other. A special programme is available for German-speaking students. The courses are harmonized with the programmes of the Louvain School of Translation and Interpreting of UCLouvain in Louvain-la-Neuve, where bachelors in translation are not offered. The Marie Haps Faculty is the only one in Belgium offering an undergraduate programme in sign language. Therefore, by an agreement between Saint-Louis University, Brussels, UCLouvain and the University of Li√®ge, students from Li√®ge can take the sign language option at ULi√®ge and follow the courses given in Brussels online, while having their other classes in Li√®ge. With its faculty of translation and interpreting, Saint-Louis University has been participating the to Erasmus programme since its creation in 1987, and before that already organized student exchanges with the University of Granada from the 1970s onwards.Speech by Philippe Moreau, head of the Marie Haps Faculty department of international relations, 2018 academic year session for international students at the University of Saint-Louis - Brussels, 21 February 2018. Semesters abroad are standard in the third year of the bachelor programme. = Research = A single research centre is affiliated to the Faculty of Translation and Interpreting: TranSph√®res. Faculty also participate in the Language Sciences Seminars (SeSLa) organized on the Saint-Louis campus. The Centre de terminologie de Bruxelles is based at Marie Haps since its foundation in 1976. = Campus = The Faculty of Translation and Interpreting is based in the H√¥tel Beernaert, former neoclassical residence of Auguste Beernaert, home of the Institut libre Marie Haps since its creation in 1919. The buildings are shared with the Haute √©cole L√©onard de Vinci and are now located on either side of the rue d'Arlon, near the European Parliament. The Marie-Haps Faculty is also located on the Tilleuls site (former ≈íuvre du Calvaire hospital) located on the Chauss√©e de Wavre, which includes a large country house, a caretaker's house, a chapel and the former hospital transformed into classrooms. In addition, it has a faculty administration on the Saint-Louis campus (rue de l'Ommegang) as well as an assistant office for the Dean (boulevard du Jardin botanique). = Student folklore = Unlike the other faculties of the Saint-Louis University - Brussels grouped in a single Cercle Saint-Louis, the folkloric student association of Marie Haps is the Cercle Marie Haps (CMH). Since its creation in the 1960s, it has only brought together students from the translation and interpretation department. Its members wear the calotte.

They were some of the first documents on the Holocaust in Poland received by the Polish government in exile, and, through it, by the Western Allies. For the 1942 report attributed to him, considered a cornerstone of his legacy, the attribution to Karski is unconfirmed. No reliable sources exist for the actual content of the information Karski carried with him to the West, and the information contained in the official reports may actually have come from other couriers.  Reports  \\"The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland\\". Document by the Polish government-in-exile based on Karski's reports, addressed to the wartime allies of the then-United Nations, 10 December 1942. Karski, who fought as a non-commissioned officer during the German invasion of Poland in 1939 and subsequently escaped from a prisoner-of-war transport, wrote his first report on the situation in Poland in late 1939. Subsequently, he escaped from Poland to France, where he joined the recreated Polish Army, and after coming to the attention of the Polish government-in-exile due to qualities like his photographic memory, he became a courier and an investigator, travelling several times between occupied Poland and France (later, the United Kingdom). His reports contained information about various aspects of the situation in occupied Poland, including topics such as the extent of Polish resistance, and on numerous German war crimes and atrocities, including the ongoing Holocaust, at that point mostly unknown in the West. His first two reports delivered to the government in exile in 1940 were entitled \\"Selected political and ideological issues in Poland\\" and \\"The Jewish situation\\". Andrzej ≈ªbikowski, Jan Karski ‚Äì bohater polskiego podziemia, ≈ªydowski Instytut Historyczny im. Emanuela Ringebluma w WarszawieStudium Europy Wschodniej, Uniwersytet Warszawski Joshua D. Zimmerman called his work the \\"Home Army's first comprehensive report on the situation of Polish Jews\\". and David Engel referred to it as \\"the first comprehensive discussion of Jewish matters in occupied Poland to have reached the [Polish] government [in exile]. His first report, compiled in France in 1940, was commissioned by a Polish leader Stanis≈Çaw Kot, who asked Karski to write up his observations on several issues, among them, implicitly, the situation of the Polish Jews. Karski wrote several more reports in the following years. His fourth report was also focused on the plight of the Jews. For the 1942 report attributed to him, considered a cornerstone of his legacy, the attribution to Karski is unconfirmed. No reliable sources exist for the actual content of the information Karski carried with him to the West, and the information contained in the official reports may actually have come from other couriers.  Reception and significance  In 1942 Karski visited London, where he met with Polish and British officials, and other prominent people. A year later he visited the United States. Although information regarding the Holocaust constituted only a small part of the information he collected and delivered, it became one of the most influential parts of his reports. The Polish government used Karski's reports to appeal to the Western Allies to interfere with the German atrocities against the Polish Jews, though by 1943 the appeals had not produced any results, as most Western leaders were not interested in or did not believe such revelations, and the Polish government officials themselves saw Jewish public opinion as unfavorable towards the Polish state. The Western Allies' response was indeed lackluster. Nechma Tec wrote that \\"Karski's reports about the Jewish plight and the messages from the Jewish leaders that inevitably pleaded for help fell on deaf ears\\". Until the revelations late in the war, many Western politicians, and even some Jewish leaders, remained skeptical of Karski's reports, which were called \\"atrocity propaganda\\". Similarly, most newspapers treated Karski's revelations as \\"a minor story\\". In 2010 Claude Lanzmann, who interviewed Karski in 1978 and in 1985 used part of that interview in his film Shoah, released a documentary focused on Karski, titled The Karski Report .

Payne was a projector who started promoting schemes in Nottinghamshire for the production of Jersey wool for stockings and woad as a dye. In this he had the backing of Francis Willoughby. For his Munster venture he recruited 25 business partners in his project, each of whom received 400 acres. He was accompanied by five farmers, fourteen freeholders, forty copyholders and twenty five cottagers and labourers. He took 1,600 for himself and his family and also managed the estates of absentee landowners. Payne maintained his connection with Willoughby whilst in Ireland. Willoghby was a sleeping partner in a project aimed at establishing an ironworks in Kinalmeaky, to be run by an English ironmaster and using woods which Willoughby had already bought nearby. In 1590 he was appointed the agent of Phane Becher, a London businessman who was an undertaker for Munster. However, when Becher arrived in Kinalmeaky he discovered faulty accounts and other unsatisfactory misconduct and sacked Payne and took a suit out against Payne, which led to him being put in the Tower of London in 1592. He died the following year.

Synopsis In the book's introduction, Bauer raises several questions which are examined in subsequent chapters. These questions are about the distinction between ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù and ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù (commonly understood as word-formation via, respectively, unconscious or semiconscious application of rules, and deliberate coining), the possibility of developing measures for productivity, the relationship between productivity and frequency or semantic coherence, and the causal relationship between unproductive processes and ungrammaticality. In the next chapter, Bauer provides a historical overview of studies on productivity and examines such issues as whether productivity is an either/or matter or gradated, and the concepts of restricted and semi-productivity. He argues that frequency, semantic coherence, and the production of a new word appear to be prerequisites for productivity rather than productivity itself. In chapter 3, Bauer tries to provide a ‚Äúprovisional‚Äù definition of productivity; and in chapter 4, he considers the psycholinguistic evidence about productivity. In chapter 5 he examines the role of corpora in studying and determining the productivity of morphological processes, and in chapter 6 he surveys the development and varying productivity of a number of historical and cross- language morphological phenomena. He also reviews several formulas proposed to calculate productivity and concludes that thus far there is no clear, unequivocal, or reliable method to determine the productivity of a morphological process, but in chapter 7 he offers a few useful observations about the productivity of processes.

Content  The book is composed of nine chapters in which he discusses English word-formation as well as what Bauer sees as its main problem areas, which he defines as including restricted productivity, lexicalization, syntax, and semantics. English Word-Formation begins with an introduction section and moves into its next chapter, which discusses some basic concepts.

At least three people was killed due to the sinking, with four further missing out of the 52 passengers and crew aboard the vessel. Characteristics The vessel, which had a 30-ton capacity, belonged to the Alor Regency local government, and was donated to the regency by the Ministry of Villages, Disadvantaged Regions and Transmigration in 2013, though its operation and maintenance was the responsibility of a local public organization. Sinking Around 1:30 AM local time on 15 June, Nusa Kenari 02 departed the port of Kalabahi - Alor's main town - bound for the village of Pureman in the other side of the island. The vessel carried 52 passengers and 4 crew, in addition to cargo which included several tons of rice and 100 bags of cement weighing each. Nusa Kenari 02 capsized some off the shores of Tanjung Margeta, on the southwestern side of the island. The vessel's water pump had failed, causing the vessel to take on water, forcing the skipper to move the boat closer to shore. In the process, a large wave struck the starboard side of the vessel, causing it to lean on one side and breaking off the upper deck. After this, many of the passengers abandoned the vessel and swam to safety. Due to the short distance from the shores, most passengers were able to swim to safety. Local police statements by the following day indicated that three people had been confirmed killed and another four were still missing, with 49 survivors. It was later found that Nusa Kenari 02 had set sail without permission from the port authority of Alor. In the search for the missing passengers, 29 search and rescue personnel from Alor, Kupang and Maumere were deployed, in addition to local police, officials, and residents.

It was sponsored by DARPA, and built and operated by BBN Technologies from about 1991-1995, after which time it was operated by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). The DSI evolved from DARPA's earlier Terrestrial Wideband Network, which could provide the realtime multicast with bandwidth guarantees that are essential to distributed interactive simulations via the Internet Stream Protocol (ST-II). A Defense Science Board study in 1993 highlighted the importance of these capabilities in simulations, and by late 1994, the DSI connected about 100 local area networks at sites around the world. Many links operated at multiple T1 circuits, for an aggregate bandwidth of about 6 megabits/second. In 1994, DSI program management transitioned to a joint program office of DARPA and DISA, and after the network became fully operational in February 1995, DARPA handed off all management responsibility to DISA. Phase I of the DSI was implemented by BBN T/20 routers running the Internet Stream Protocol. Phase II, completed in October 1997, was a reimplementation using Cisco 7500 routers running the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) over ATM permanent virtual circuits. The Phase II topology was a mesh of 7 backbone nodes, with 46 tail circuits running to the other DSI sites as of April 1998. (See D. Sahu for a Phase II network map and extensive details.)

Bowerbank's obituary in The Daily Telegraph described him as a ‚Äòcelebrated member of West London society and one of the best conversationalists of his generation‚Äô.Obituary in The Daily Telegraph, Christopher Bowerbank, 30 April 2002 Will Self recalled that Bowerbank had the ability to transition between the \\"haut, beau and demi-mondes\\". In his later years Bowerbank, ‚Äòwith his shock of grey hair and a look of glittering purpose‚Äô, was said to resemble Beethoven. In his early years as an architect, Bowerbank lived in Camden in the same house as Bruce Robinson, the film producer. Bowerbank's Jaguar was said to be the inspiration behind the mode of transport to Penrith in Robinson's cult classic film Withnail and I. At the time of Bowerbank's death he was engaged to Emma Soames, the editor of The Daily Telegraph magazine and granddaughter of Winston Churchill. According to his obituary in The Daily Telegraph, Bowerbank 'talked to everyone with the same charm and vigorous attack ‚Äì whether it was Princess Margaret or the locals on his beloved Orkney island of Rousay, where he had a home for more than 25 years‚Äô. Early life Christopher William Bowerbank was born on 17 November 1940 in Biddestone, Wiltshire. He was the son of a Royal Navy Commander, Geoffrey Bowerbank, and Mary Winifred Bowerbank (n√©e Kirtley), and educated at Sherborne School where he shared a study with Nigel Dempster. Bowerbank matriculated at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, graduating with a first, and afterwards turned down two scholarship offers to study English at Columbia University, New York. Sir Peter Cook was influential on Bowerbank's architectural style. Architectural career Redcliffe Mews, largely designed by Christopher Bowerbank After the AA, Bowerbank attempted a series of apprenticeships which were not to his liking. He temporarily and characteristically ended up an escort and driver to Marianne Faithfull through whom he gained a commission to design the headquarters of Impact Records, then the record label of The Rolling Stones. The headquarters were never constructed but the experience set up Bowerbank as an independent architect for the rest of his professional life. Bowerbank built his practice in London's Fitzrovia, behind Bertorelli's Restaurant on Charlotte Street. He was never a modernist in architectural style: when asked to extend or modify an old building, he would not seek to detract from the original, reflecting his respect for British style and tradition. Bowerbank worked on both residential and commercial buildings and he was noted for his sympathetic restoration of listed buildings, particularly in London. His work often required complex negotiations with English Heritage and council planners. The Convent, Stourhead, before its restoration by Bowerbank Bowerbank's work included the headquarters for Radiodetection in Bristol, work on Redcliffe Mews in London and Howabreck House on Orkney. In 1990, he won an English Heritage award for his renovation work on The Convent in Stourhead, Wiltshire, which was Grade I listed. Personal life From an early age, Bowerbank was an amateur ornithologist. He rarely talked about his professional work, preferring instead to talk about literature, philosophy and the European Union, the latter being a subject on which he was a firm critic. At the time of Bowerbank's death he was engaged to Emma Soames, granddaughter of Winston Churchill and then the editor of The Daily Telegraph magazine. Bowerbank's great uncle was Sir Fred Thompson Bowerbank, Hon. Physician to King George VI. For 25 years, Bowerbank had a home on the island of Orkney, Viera Lodge, where he entertained friends from London and engaged in his love of ornithology. Bowerbank died in his sleep in Notting Hill on 25 April 2002, aged 61.

On 1 January 1911, the Northern Territory was transferred from South Australia to federal control. The Act was repealed by the federal government's Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 on 13 June 1918, which carried forward many of the provisions of the 1910 Act. Description The Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910 was an Act of the South Australian parliament (Act no. 1024/1910), assented to on 7 December 1910. On 1 January 1911, the Northern Territory was transferred from South Australia to federal government control. The Act established the Northern Territory Aboriginals Department and created the office of Chief Protector of Aborigines. The department was responsible for the control and welfare of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Under the Act, the Chief Protector of Aborigines was appointed the \\"legal guardian of every Aboriginal and every half-caste child up to the age of 18 years\\", and had the power to confine such children to an Aboriginal reserve or institution. The Act provided the legal basis for enforcing segregation. That is, Indigenous children could be removed by Administrative order, whereas non-Indigenous children at the time could only be removed by order of a Court. The Act allowed for regulations to be made for the \\"care, custody and education of the children of aboriginals\\". This included the power to transfer children to \\"aboriginal institutions\\" and \\"industrial schools\\". The Act was the first and only legislation passed in South Australia which related to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 The Act was repealed by the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 (Act No. 9/1918) on 13 June 1918, which combined and replaced the Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910 and the Commonwealth Aboriginals Ordinance 1911. The 1918 Ordinance was amended 18 times over the following decades, and was repealed by the Welfare Ordinance 1953. Many of the provisions of the 1910 Act carried forward into the 1918 Ordinance, including the power to transfer Aboriginal children into institutions. Under the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918, the Chief Protector was also given total control of all Indigenous women regardless of their age, unless married to a man who was \\"substantially of European origin\\", and his approval was required for any marriage of an Indigenous woman to a non- Indigenous man. Between 1918 and 1921, large areas of the Territory and adjacent states were classified as Aboriginal reserves and sanctuaries for remaining nomadic populations who had hitherto had little contact with white Australia. In 1920, the area including Uluru, in Anangu territory, was declared an Aboriginal Reserve under the Aboriginals Ordinance. In 1953, the Aboriginals Ordinance 1953 amended the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 (NT). This empowered the Director of Native Affairs (previously Chief Protector of Aborigines until changed by the Aboriginals Ordinance 1939) with legal guardianship of all \\"aboriginals\\", thus making them wards of the state. He would also oversee many matters relevant to the lives of Aboriginal people.

ACEN accreditation is voluntary, but according to the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, ACEN acts as the Title IV \\"gatekeeper\\" for nursing education programs. Along with state nursing boards, ACEN determines whether nursing programs can have accreditation and maintain it. Therefore, many nursing programs organize around ACEN standards. History In 1893, The American Society of Superintendents of Training Schools for Nurses was founded. The organization's mission was to create a universal standard of nurse training. In 1938, National League for Nursing Education (NLNE) began accreditation for registered nurse education programs. Beginning in 1964, federal funding for nursing education under the US Nurse Training Act was contingent upon the compliance of schools of nursing with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of the same year. In 1997, the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) began operations with sole authority for performing the nursing accreditation processes. Today there are three program accrediting agencies for nursing in the US. The current CEO for ACEN is Marsal P. Stoll.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History Richard D. Gregory arrived in Augusta in 1864. Shortly thereafter, he married a local schoolteacher, Mary C. Woodward. In 1865, the couple purchased the 120 acres on which this house is located from Seth Pratt. They constructed a house on the land some time around 1870; however, this was likely an earlier house and not the present one. The Gregorys farmed the land, adding more acreage in the 1870s. They also became involved in the local community, with Richard serving as a village trustee and highway commissioner and Mary a board member of the Augusta Ladies Library Association. The present house was likely built in about 1880. Mary Gregory died in 1891; the couple had no children. Richard remarried the following year, to Mary Gott, whose family owned a neighboring farm. The couple had a daughter, Lillian, in 1894, but by 1900 Richard was living in the Kalamazoo Asylum. He died in 1903. In 1904, Mary remarried, to George Godde, and in 1906 Lillian Gregory had officially inherited the estate. Mary and George Godde continued farming, and had eight children. In 1924, George Godde died in a lightning strike. Mary continued farming; in 1931, Lillian, having married and moved, deeded the farm to Mary. Mary Godde died in 1947, and in 1949 the farm was sold to William Alonzo and Eugenie Ethel Sibole of Benton Harbor, Michigan. Eugenie died in 1954, and the farm was sold again. Description The Gregory House is a two-story, cross gable, nearly symmetrical Eastlake house. It is wood framed, and sits on a cut stone block foundation. The walls are covered with wooden weatherboard, with trim outlining the windows. Five- sided bay windows are centered on the side facades. Other windows in the house are one-over-one double-hung units with double rows of saw-tooth trim just above. Some second floor windows are paired, with gabled caps of classical decoration. Some of the single windows on the porches and on the second floor have flat classical caps. The front facade, facing the road, has a central chimney. A 1-1/2-story gabled wing projects to the rear. The house has four matching porches with cutwork trim, which give the house a distinctive appearance. The porches are identical, and are located in the four angles formed by the intersection of the wings. The porches have low-pitched hipped roofs supported by corner brackets on square chamfered-edge columns. Between supports is a turned spindle balustrade. Other decorative elements include pinwheel patterns on the gables and sawtooth trim on gables edges.

It was founded in 1851 by the members of another Bombay reform association, the Jnayan Prasarak Mandali, whose members included Narmadashankar Dave (Narmad) and his fellow writers. The Jnayan Prasarak Mandali was a branch of the Students' Literary and Scientific Society of the Elphinstone Institution (now Elphinstone College). The aim and object of the Buddhi Vardhak Sabha was to work for the social welfare of the Gujarati Hindu people, and to awaken public opinion for social change through lectures, debates and writings. Other founding members included Pranlal Mathurdas, Mohanlal Ranchhoddas Jhaveri, Karsandas Mulji, and Dalpatram. History Bombay's Elphinstone Institution played an instrumental role in providing an intellectual background for the reform movements in Western India. In June 1848, its students started the Students' Literary and Scientific Society. In September 1848, two other branches of this society were established, one Gujarati, and the other Marathi. The Gujarati branch was known as Jnayan Prasarak Mandali (Society for Promotion of Knowledge), and was presided by Ranchhoddas Girdharbhai Jhaveri. Most of the members of this Mandali were Parsi students. In 1850, the young Hindu members of the Jnayan Prasarak Mandali felt that a special organization was necessary to devote more attention to Hindu welfare. Accordingly, in June 1850, Narmad, with friends including Mayaram Shambhunath, Kalyanji Shivlal, and Narandas Kalyandas, founded the Juvan Purushoni Anyonya Buddhi Vardhak Sabha with the aim of furthering Hindu discussion of reforms. Narmad was its president. On 23 March 1851, the decision was made to broaden the society's focus, and change its name to Buddhi Vardhak Hindu Sabha. The first meeting was held that same day, and rules adopted. Pranlal Mathurdas was appointed as the first president of the Buddhi Vardhak Hindu Sabha, with Mohanlal Ranchhoddas Jhaveri and Kishorlal respectively as secretary and treasurer. 70 members enrolled at the inaugural meeting, for a fee of Rs. 2 per month. According to the Sabha's rules, membership was restricted to Hindu people. Others, however, were invited to take part in the discussion. Over the next 20 years, the Buddhi Vardhak Hindu Sabha and its members played an important role in the social reform movements of Bombay city and other cities of Gujarat. The Sabha's status began to decline after 1876, with the gradual demise of its founders. Publication In 1851, the Buddhi Vardhak Sabha began publication of a monthly journal, Buddhi Vardhak Granth, of which Narmad assumed the editorship. The first issue was published in 1851, the second and third issues appearing in 1953. Regular publication began from March 1856. Articles published dealt mainly with social issues. Activities The main object of the Buddhi Vardhak Sabha was to awaken the social consciousness of Hindu people through debate, talks and writings. Prominent speakers were to be invited, and each meeting devoted to the discussion of a particular problem and consideration of how to solve it. In May 1851, the Sabha's members started Bombay's first schools for Hindu girls, one in the Fort area, and another near Bhuleshwar. Members of the Sabha, and students of the Elphinstone Institution, volunteered to teach in these girls' schools. The Buddhi Vardhak Sabha offered prizes for the best essays written on topics of social importance. The Buddhi Vardhak Sabha's activities were supported by wealthy Gujarati patrons, including Sheth Mangaldas Nathubhai, Laxmidas Khimji, and Gokuldas Tejpal, and by Maharashtrian reformers like Dadoba Pandurang, Atmaram Pandurang, and Bhau Daji.

Earlier in his career he had been a concert pianist, but from 1964 until his death he concentrated on his work as an author and teacher of cooking. Early life and piano career Field was born in New York City. His mother died when he was three years old, and he was raised by William Calhoun, a piano teacher, and his wife. Field said that the latter \\"got him interested in cooking\\".

His obituary in The New York Times commented that their repertoire included the classics and premieres of new works.

On 2 June 2015, a reform committee met to discuss possible reforms to the law, wanting to promote national cinema and reduce the showings of foreign films in the country.  History of the law  In 1981, President Luis Herrera Campins created the Fund to Promote Filmmaking (Fondo de Fomento Cinematogr√°firco; Foncine), which had the objective to promote national filmmaking efforts and to finance the production of both feature and short films. In 1990, by Presidential decree, the Cinemateca Nacional de Venezuela was created, which is currently in force and has the objective to protect all audiovisual content produced in the country. On 8 September 1993, the first National Cinematography Law was approved by the government of Ram√≥n J. Vel√°zquez, offering an instrument to achieve the organization of a Guild of Filmmakers and to modernize said sector in the country. However, this first version of the law didn't contain any protections for producers and distributors, raising questions about pay-per-screen for national films being a problem that would strongly affect the distribution of them. Later, on 26 October 2005, the first reform of the law occurred, where the name was changed to \\"National Cinematography Law\\" (Spanish: Ley de la Cinematograf√≠a Nacional),Gaceta Oficial N¬∫ 5.789 as well as other changes, like the inclusion of providing a percentage of the pay-per-screen fee for Venezuelan films, greater participation of the private sector in filmmaking activities through taxes and financial incentives, and the creation of the Fund to Promote and Finance Film (Fondo de Promoci√≥n y Financiamiento del Cine; FONPROCINE), which has the goal to encourgae, promote, develop, and finance the national filmmaking industry. In 2006, through an executive order, the Villa del Cine was created, the first production house in the country, with the job to produce films that promote national identity, cultural values, diversity, and other themes that encourage national customs. In 2014, new reforms were proposed, and, in 2015, a reform committee comprising the , the president of Centro Nacional Aut√≥nomo de Cinematograf√≠a (CNAC), and representatives of the filmmaking industry, met to discuss different proposals, but did not arrive at agreement for any reforms to the law. Since then, there have been efforts to have another evaluation of the proposals with the aim to reform Venezuelan cinema.  Particulars  The law contains 72 articles, divided into 5 chapters and 12 sections. The law came into force 60 days after being published. = Protection and development of Venezuela cinema = According to what is established in articles 1 and 3, and the introduction, the law has the principal function and objective to develop (i.e. liberate circulation of cinematogeaphic works), encourage, broadcast (including production and distribution), as well as protect and conserve, all audiovisual products and diachronic images organized in speech, with the possibility of being exhibited as mass media. = Responsible entity and functions = Articles 5 and 6 indicate the creation of the CNAC, as part of the Ministry of Culture. Within this entity, there exist the bodies of the National Administrative Council of Cinema (Consejo Nacional Administrativo), the Executive Committee of Cinema (Comit√© Ejecutivo) and FONPROCINE. In article 7, the functions of the CNAC are outlined, which complement the main objectives, some of which are: *To design the general guidelines of film policy *To incentivize the creation and protection of cinemas and theatres for exhibition *To encourage the development and maintenance of a filmmaking infrastructure *To encourage the constitution of autonomous funds, regional and municipal, for the production, creation, distribution, exhibition, and broadcast of national films Similarly, in article 8, more specifically, the responsibilities of the sub-bodies are identified. For example, the National Administrative Council's functions include approval and planning of activities, setting financial policies, and promoting conventions. = President of the CNAC = Article 13 corresponds to the President of the CNAC, who may be freely appointed and removed by the President of Venezuela, and who fulfils the following duties: *Exercise legal representation of the CNAC *Develop and present the Internal Operating Plan and the Annual Budget, and submit them to the Executive Committee *Present to the National Administrative Council the Preliminary Draft of the Cinematography Plan, and adopt the initiatives most convenient for its execution and development *Apply the established sanctions of the law, and raise requests for exemption with the Executive Committee = Assets of the CNAC = In article 16, the assets of the CNAC are established as comprising: #The rights, goods, actions, and obligations #Contributions that are assigned by law #The product of the fees established in this law and the income from services provided by the institution #Contributions or donations made by natural or legal citizens #The amount of the fines and penalties given by the CNAC #The amount that FONPROCINE transfers annually to the CNAC = The culture of filmmaking, and its distribution = In article 17 it is established that the CNAC should stimulate and may carry out activities such as: the importing of cinematographic works of relevant artistic and cultural quality; the teaching, research, conservation, archiving and cultural dissemination of cinematographic works‚Äîincluding coordinating other public or private institutions that perform related activities in the participation of this task; encouraging the attendance of people to cinemas and theatres; and to incentivize and promote the constitution of the spectator committees. Seeking an adequate and effective distribution of all audiovisual material, the law has specific articles that require an adequate handling of the exhibition of films to be made: Article 22. The CNAC should promote a policy of distribution of films of relevant artistic and cultural quality Article 23. The cinemas and exhibition theatres are by nature places of culture and recreation. The entities that are public and private, national, state and municipal, should promote and incentivize their construction and conservation to benefit the people Article 26. All cinematographic or audiovisual works, prior to their distribution, sale and exhibition, should be classified corresponding to age group, by the CNAC. The guidelines should establish the procedure to follow for the achievement of this without breaking the Law of Municipal Public Power (Spanish: Ley Org√°nica del Poder P√∫blico Municipal). = Copy and Commercialization = Each distributor must make a minimum copy quota that is not less than 20% of the number of copies of the foreign cinematographic works that it sells, according to article 29. Regarding commercialization, article 30 indicates that all Venezuelan audiovisual work or product will be guaranteed distribution, with a variable period of screening. The minimum length of cinema stay is two weeks. # For film complexes that have more than five screens, the equivalent of twelve weeks of cinema # For film complexes that have between two and five screens, the equivalent of six weeks of cinema # For film complexes that have a screen, the equivalent of three weeks of cinema Article 34 provides that the CNAC will decide the stay of a film according to its ticket sales. This applies to national and international material. = Promoting and financing the cinema industry = As provided by article 36, there is an autonomous fund not intended for legislation, FONPROCINE. This is assigned and administered by the CNAC, with separate assets, and made up of contributions from the public and private sector, income from international cooperation, and income generated by the development or promotion of film activities. According to article 40, this money is destined for: #The creation of works of national cinema #The distribution of cinematographic works that are national, independent Latino- and Ibero-American, and other works of a universal quality which will contribute to the development of the principle of cultural diversity #The establishment, updating and improvement of cinemas and exhibition theatres #The establishment or updating of laboratories for processing and copying film #The establishment or updating of facilities for dubbing, subtitling, post- production, and new technologies #The stimulation, subsidies, and incentives for the production of Venezuelan cinema = Certification of films = According to article 42, films will be certified as national if they meet the criteria of: cinematographic works, of non-advertising or propaganda, with Venezuelan director or when the script, adaptation, plot, story, dialogue or technical script has a Venezuelan author, or either are a foreigner who is a legal resident of the country. The Executive Committee may demand the requirements for works also in Spanish or an indigenous language. With article 44, the CNAC may promote binational or multinational agreements, pacts or conventions, according to which foreign cinematographic works may obtain the same benefits granted to nationals, provided there are conditions of reciprocity. = Guarantee of creative freedom = Article 47 states that no creator or producer may be deprived of personal freedom because of the subject, content, script, characters or other elements inherent in the message or idea of the cinematographic work, unless there is a judicial decision in court. Also, article 48 says that the public exhibition of a cinematographic work in any medium, as well as its sale, rent or commercialization, can not be objected to censorship or cuts without the express and prior authorization from the holder of the work's authorship rights. = Fees and contributions = According to articles 50 and 51 of the law, a special contribution or tax should be enforced, that will be paid by legal or natural citizens whose registered business is the exhibition of cinematographic works for commercial purposes. It will be paid to FONPROCINE and be equivalent to 5% of the value of the ticket. Those who work in exhibition but in alternative or independent theatres may be exempt from this fee. The tax will be self-assessed and must be paid within the first fifteen days of the month following. In article 51 it is outlined that companies that provide television service with an open signal for commercial purposes will pay FONPROCINE a different special contribution, calculated based on the gross income received from the sale of advertising spaces. This will be paid annually within the first forty-five continuous days of the calendar year following. On the other hand, article 52 says that companies that provide television service with signal broadcasting by subscription for commercial purposes‚Äîbe it cable, satellite or any other present of future system‚Äîwould pay FONCINE a special contribution that will be determined as follows: 5 tenths percent (0.50%) the first year, one percent (1%) the second year, and one and a half percent (1.5%) from the third year, of the gross income of the company's commercial profit from subscription service. This will be paid quarterly within the first fifteen continuous days of the month following. Article 53. Commercial distributors of cinematographic works will pay to FONPROCINE a special contribution, equivalent to (5%) of their gross income, exigible within the first forty-five continuous days following the expiration of the respective year. This provision shall not apply to persons whose gross income obtained in the respective fiscal period does not exceed ten thousand tax units (10,000 UT). Article 54. Natural or legal citizens engaged in the rental or sale of videograms, digital video discs, as well as any other existing or future duplication system, will pay FONPROCINE, a special contribution equivalent to five percent (5%) of their monthly invoicing, without affecting the corresponding value added tax, payable within the first fifteen continuous days following the month of the occurrence of the taxable event. Article 55. The natural or legal citizens, referred to in the previous article, must place on each videogram, case, or container of the cinematographic work, before its sale or rental, the printed or computerized media that the CNAC establish to the effect. These can not be marketed without the badge to identify their corresponding record. Article 56. The companies regularly engage in, for profit, the technical, technological, logistic, or other service for the production and creation of cinematographic works in the national territory, will pay to FONPROCINE a special contribution, equivalent to one percent (1%) of the gross income obtained in those activities, payable quarterly, within fifteen (15) days following the end of the quarter. = Exemptions, exonerations, and stimuli = Article 57 specifies that income tax-payers who make investments or donations to Venezuelan production or co-production film projects authorized by the CNAC may include as an expense (in the determination of the corresponding income tax to the taxable period in which the investment or donation is made and regardless of its income producing activity) the total of the real value invested or donated. The regulation of the law will establish the conditions, terms, and requirements to grant this tax benefit. In no case will it be granted to advertising or propaganda cinema. Articles 58 and 60 explain that during the first five years counted, the legal entities that produce, distribute, and exhibit national cinematographic works of a non-advertising or propaganda nature, are exempt from the payment of income tax for the income and net benefits obtained from said activities. Film exhibitors may reduce by up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the special contribution they pay, as directly beneficial to the exhibition activity, when they exhibit Venezuelan cinematographic works (certified as such by the CNAC) beyond the screen quota indicated in article 30. = Infractions and sanctions = According to Article 63, the sanctions established in this law must be applied by the CNAC, for the purpose of establishing penalties for tax or administrative faults (as set out in the Organic Tax Code and in the Organic Law of Administrative Procedures), as soon as they are applicable. Article 68. The CNAC, may order the stoppage of any cinematographic work of foreign production that does not have permission, without prejudice, and impose a fine of fifty tax units (50 U.T.). Article 69. The CNAC, at the request of an interested party or ex officio, may, through a reasonable administrative act, order preventive retention of support or any nature containing cinematographic works that have not complied with the provisions of this law. For this it can request the aid of the public force. = Procedure and arbitration = Article 71. The sanctioning administrative procedures initiated by the CNAC are governed by the principles of speed, efficiency, economy and immediacy. The procedures will be initiated by complaint of an interested party or ex officio. The legal consultancy of the CNAC will open the procedure itself, following the rules established in the Law of Administrative Procedures. Then, on the same day, the citation of the accused will be ordered, as appropriate, so that on the third working day following the citation the response may be recorded, or the charges dropped. Next, a trial period of five working days will open. The parties will present their conclusions within the next two business days. The legal consultancy will present on the fifth working day a draft decision to the Executive Committee, who will make a decision within thirty business days following its receipt, thus exhausting the administrative procedure. Jurisdictional appeals against the decision may be made in the following thirty working days, counted from the notification. This mechanism suspends the effects of the act. Article 72. The individuals and legal entities subject of this Law will submit to arbitration unresolved disputes between them, that arise with respect to the legal relationships regulated by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Arbitration Law.  Additional laws in the filmmaking sector  Within the broad audiovisual field there are many issues that fall within different sectors and other types of laws and regulations are applicable. Some relevant laws include: * Regulation of the National Cinematography Law * Internal Regulation of Stimulus to the Culture of Filmmaking * Authorial Rights Law * Law of Culture Likewise, Antonio D 'Jes√∫s, the Permanent Secretary of the Commission for Culture and Recreation, issued a statement in December 2016 regarding the problems of censorship with the Venezuelan film El Inca which, in accordance with the aforementioned laws, should be given: # Guarantee of Freedom of Creation # Understanding that the freedom of creation is part of Venezuelan cultural diversity # All Venezuelans have the right to access Venezuelan cultural diversity through release, production and investment  References  * Reglamento de la Ley de Cinematograf√≠a Nacional Retrieved 9 January 2017 (.gob.ve) * Marco Jur√≠dico del Sector Cinematogr√°fico Retrieved 10 January 2017 (.gob.ve)  Category:Venezuelan law Category:Cinema of Venezuela Category:1993 in law ","title":"National Cinematography Law"},{"id":"61063500","title":"Ray Sadeghi"},{"id":"61063505","text":"Toua is a Papua New Guinean name.

Biography Born in St George's-in-the-East, in the East End of London, Davis served an apprenticeship as a tailor, then in 1921 became the manager of the Brown Bear pub, which was owned by his father. He joined the Labour Party, and in 1921 was elected as an alderman on Stepney Metropolitan Borough Council. He also stood for Whitechapel and St George's at the 1922 London County Council election, missing out on election by 87 votes, winning the seat easily in 1925. Davis won an elected seat on Stepney Council at a by-election in 1924. Now a prominent local figure, he was appointed to four council committees within his first six months, and by 1928 he chaired the council's education, finance, markets, and valuation committees. That year, he made a popular decision to reduce the gap between market stalls, allowing more to be set up, despite this being in violation of national law. He also won a series of libel cases against newspapers which had incorrectly associated him with corrupt electoral practices, namely paying hackney carriages to take voters to the polling station. Davis was active in the Federation of Synagogues, and became a leading figure in the opposition to its unpopular anti-socialist leader, Louis Montagu. Montagu was ousted in 1925, and Davis then began chairing meetings of the federation, also becoming treasurer of its associated burial society. In this role, he championed donations to the Jewish National Fund and the Keren Hayesod, the first major Jewish organisation in the UK to donate to Zionist causes. After a couple of years with no president, Davis narrowly won the office in 1928, and he used the office to centralise the organisation, support Zionist causes, and help Jewish refugees from Nazism. He succeeded in attracting more synagogues to affiliate, but his willingness to act outside the organisation's constitution and postpone elections to its council were controversial. Davis became the leader of Stepney Council in 1935, building a coalition of working class Jewish and Irish Catholic voters. However, the Spanish Civil War proved challenging, with Davis supporting the Republicans, but many Catholic voters supporting the Nationalists. While opposed to fascism, Davis did not take part in the Battle of Cable Street, and even voted to permit the British Union of Fascists to hold meetings in Limehouse Town Hall. Under Davis' leadership, concerns grew that Stepney Council was inefficient, and that Davis was turning a blind eye to corruption. He was dropped from the London County Council at the 1934 election, although he regained a seat in 1937, after his successor was imprisoned for theft. He continued a range of popular initiatives, including condemning the release of Oswald Mosley from prison, but was criticised for failing to construct air raid shelters, and in 1940 was stripped of his responsibility for civil defence. In 1944, Davis travelled by train without a ticket. When caught, he gave a false name, and to support this, he persuaded a council official to forge an identity card in the name of \\"Harold Green\\". The ruse was unsuccessful, and he was sentenced to six months in prison. On release, he retired to Stamford Hill and led an isolated life, dying in 1985.

Takemoto was trained by Kana and Minoru Tanaka, making her debut in February 2015. Konami spent her early career competing for independent promotions such as Pro Wrestling Wave, Reina and JWP, eventually signing to Reina. After leaving the promotion in July 2016, she went on a short hiatus before returning to pro wrestling in November and debuting for World Wonder Ring Stardom in December 2016, going on to become a regular in the promotion before signing full time in May 2018.  Career  = Early career (2015‚Äì2016) = Konami in June 2015 Konami first developed an interest in pro wrestling through her brother, who was an avid fan himself and would regularly watch it on television. Eventually, her and her brother attended a local show where she met Kana, and expressed interest in becoming a wrestler. Kana told her to apply for training after she had at least graduated junior high school and gave her her contact details. While she attended high school, she trained under former MMA fighter Megumi Fujii at a local martial arts gym. After graduating from high school in 2014, she moved to Tokyo and began training under Kana and Minoru Tanaka. Konami debuted for Kanapromania in early 2015, initially competing as a member of Kana's agency. After Kana announced she would be leaving for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in late 2015, Konami was forced to leave the agency and soon after signed with Reina Joshi Puroresu. She also started competing for Pro Wrestling Wave and JWP, unsuccessfully challenging Rydeen Hagane for the JWP Junior Championship and the Princess of Pro-Wrestling Championship on July 17, 2016. In July, Konami announced her intention to resign from Reina, and on July 21, she co-promoted a final show with Reina, teaming with Yuko Miyamoto in a fluorescent light tubes deathmatch main event, losing to Jun Kasai and Kagetsu. After quitting Reina, Konami made appearances for World Woman Pro-Wrestling Diana and Wave, before announcing she would be taking an indefinite leave from pro wrestling after August 14 to treat and recover from internal diseases, but vowed to return. In her farewell match, she teamed with her trainer Minoru Tanaka in a loss to Cat Power and Onryo. While recovering from treatment, she announced she had signed with agency GPS, and would return at their produced show on November 5. In her return match, she lost to Kairi Hojo. = World Wonder Ring Stardom (2016‚Äìpresent) =  Debut and initial feuds (2016‚Äì2017)  Konami debuted for World Wonder Ring Stardom on December 22, 2016, defeating Hiromi Mimura, and confirmed she would be competing for the promotion regularly. She was pushed as a strong contender despite being a newcomer, wrestling in competitive matches against established wrestlers like Toni Storm, Io Shirai and Yoko Bito. She began a feud with Kairi Hojo, and unsuccessfully challenged for the Wonder of Stardom Championship on March 26, 2017. After losing to Hojo, the two formed an alliance, and teamed with Hiromi Mimura to win the Artist of Stardom Championship on May 6, 2017, giving Konami her first ever championship. They lost the titles less than a month later to Queen's Quest. Konami entered her first 5 Star Grand Prix in August but struggled greatly, losing all but one of her matches, defeating Mandy Leon on the final day.  Queen's Quest (2018‚Äì2019)  At the annual unit draft on April 15, 2018, Konami was picked by Io Shirai to be drafted into her Queen's Quest stable. On May 20, she officially announced that she had joined the Stardom roster full time. As a member of Queen's Quest, she received a shot at the Goddesses of Stardom Championship, teaming with Momo Watanabe in a loss to Mayu Iwatani and Saki Kashima. She entered the 5 Star Grand Prix once again and to greater success, finishing with 6 points but failing to make the final. On September 30th, she unsuccessfully challenged Nicole Savoy for the Shimmer Championship. After 364 days in Queen's Quest, Konami was drafted to the Tokyo Cyber Squad on April 14, 2019.  Tokyo Cyber Squad (2019)  Konami joined the Tokyo Cyber Squad in April 2019, and took part in the 2019 Cinderella Tournament, making it to the final where she lost to Arisa Hoshiki. On May 16, Konami, Hana Kimura and Jungle Kyona defeated Iwatani, Tam Nakano and Kashima to win the Artist of Stardom Championship.

After finishing third on his only appearance as a two- year-old in 2017 he showed steady improvement in the following spring, winning two minor races and finishing second in the Spring Stakes before recording his biggest success in the Satsuki Sho. He went on to finish runner-up in the Tokyo Yushun but failed to reproduce his best form in two subsequent starts that year. Background Epoca d'Oro is a bay colt bred in Japan by Toru Tagami. As a foal in 2015 he was consigned to the Select Sale and was bought for ¬•36,720,000 by the Union Owner's Club. The colt was sent into training with Hideaki Fujiwara. He was ridden in most of his races by Keita Kosaki. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Orfevre, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2011 and whose wins included the Satsuki Sho, Tokyo Yushun, Kikuka Sho, Arima Kinen and Takarazuka Kinen. Orfevre's other progeny include Lucky Lilac. Epoca d'Oro's dam Daiwa Passion was a top-class performer whose wins included the Fairy Stakes and the Fillies' Revue. She was a great- granddaughter of the outstanding Irish mare Cairn Rouge whose other descendants have included Persuasive. Racing career =2017: two-year-old season= Epoca d'Oro made his first and only appearance as a two-year-old in a contest for previously unraced juveniles over 1800 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 9 October. Racing on firm turf he finished third of the ten runners behind Tanglewood and Satono Eternal. =2018: three-year-old season= Epoca d'Oro's regular jockey Keita Tosaki On his three-year-old debut Epoca d'Oro recorded his first victory when he defeated Rano Kau and fourteen others in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Kyoto on 21 January. Three weeks later he was stepped up in distance and followed up successfully in the Asunaro Sho over 2000 metres at Kokura Racecourse. In the following month he was moved up in class for the Grade 2 Spring Stakes (a trial race for the Satsuki Sho) over 1800 metres at Nakayama Racecourse and was made the 4.3/1 third choice in a field of thirteen runners. Ridden by Tosaki he settled in second place before taking the lead in the straight but was caught on the line and beaten a nose by the favourite Stelvio. On 15 April at the same track Epoca d'Oro, with Tosaki again in the saddle, started at odds of 13.5/1 for the 78th edition of the Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres. Wagnerian started favourite ahead of Stelvio with the other thirteen runners including Kitano Commandeur (Sumire Stakes), Time Flyer (Hopeful Stakes, Gendarme (Daily Hai Nisai Stakes), Oken Moon (Tokinominoru Kinen) and Generale Uno (Keisei Stakes). Aithon set a strong pace from Jun Valerot and Generale Uno with the trio pulling many lengths clear of the others who were headed by Epoca d'Oro. The leaders began to tire approaching the final turn and Epoca d'Oro gained the advantage from Generale Uno in the last 200 metres before drawing away to win by two lengths from Sans Rival. Tosaki commented \\"I was able to position him as planned. He ran in good rhythm and responded well rounding the final corner. He's a smart horse and is developing with each race. His powerful run today shows that he will have no problem handling the extra distance in the Tokyo Yushun\\". At Tokyo Racecourse on 27 May Epoca d'Oro was made the 8.5/1 fourth choice behind Danon Premium, Blast Onepiece and Kitano Commandeur in the 85th running of the Tokyo Yushun over 2400 metres. He took the lead soon after the start, led the field into the straight and repelled several challengers before being caught in the final strides by Wagnerian and beaten half a length into second place. After a break of almost four months the colt returned for the Kobe Shimbun Hai at Hanshin Racecourse in September and started joint-favourite with Wagnerian. After stumbling as he exited the starting gate he raced towards the rear of the field before staying on in the straight and came home fourth of the ten runners. On his final start of the season Epoca d'Oro started third favourite for the Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres. He was in contention for most of the way but faded in the closing stages to finish eighth behind Fierement, beaten five lengths by the winner. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Epoca d'Oro was rated the 15th best three-year-old colt in the world and the 78th best horse of any age or sex. In January 2019 Epoca d'Oro finished fourth behind Blast Onepiece, Wagnerian and the dirt champion Le Vent Se Leve in the poll to determine the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Colt for 2018 . =2019: four-year-old season= Epoca d'Oro began his third campaign in the Grade 2 Nakayama Kinen on 24 February and came home fifth of the eleven starters behind Win Bright, Lucky Lilac, Stelvio and Suave Richard, beaten two lengths by the winner. In the Grade 1 Osaka Hai the horse started a 13.3/1 outsider in a fourteen-runner field. He set the pace and maintained his advantage into the straight but dropped away quickly in the closing stages and finished tenth behind Al Ain. Epoca d'Oro did not race again in 2019.

Popovoviƒá stated that his mother was financially struggling while raising them. According to Relja, he found his passion for music during middle school through his brother who would expose him to hip-hop artists such as Eminem, Jay-Z and Juice. In seventh grade, Popoviƒá started writing his own songs together with his classmate Vladimir Matoviƒá. Before graduating high school he was injured in a gunfire and had his kidney and spleen removed. Popoviƒá graduated from the Faculty of Media and Communications at the Singidunum University. He also attended the Academy of Arts, but claims to have couple of exams left to graduate.

Adlay Gideon \\"Adi\\" Stenroth (1896 ‚Äì 23 May 1931 Hanoi, French Indochina) was a Finnish officer in the French Foreign Legion. He was likely the only Finn who ever became an officer in the Legion.  Biography  Stenroth‚Äôs father worked for the Finnish railways as the head of the V√§rtsil√§ station. Stenroth took his matriculation exams in the Nurmes mixed secondary school in 1915. Stenroth knew many languages. The Swedish language appears to have been his native language, in addition to which he naturally knew Finnish, as well as German and Russian. He started his studies in the Helsinki Business School, but they were cut short by the Finnish Civil War. In the war, he fought in the Helsinki Jaeger Brigade, e.g. in the Battle of Helsinki. Having participated in the war, he was now attracted to a military career, and he was accepted into the Artillery School in Lappeenranta. There he studied with e.g. future General Lieutenant A. F. Airo. After the Artillery School, Stenroth served in the Field Artillery Regiment 2, until he unexpectedly resigned in February 1920, possibly because some financial affairs that had gone awry. His career as an officer had just started off well, and he was described as a ‚Äúcomplete balking foal, in the right sense of the word.‚Äù He left for France, wherein April 1920, he joined the Foreign Legion in Arras, with a contract for five years, beginning his service in the rank of a private. The first years he served as an NCO responsible for combat materials, until he participated in a course for future officers in 1924, completing it as the top of the course, his score has been 18/20. He has been promoted a sublieutenant in July of the same year. It seems likely he knew French well at that point, as officers had to have an excellent command of the language. During 1925‚Äì26 Stenroth participated in the Rif War in North Africa, where he fought against e.g. the Berber troops of the charismatic Moroccan Abd el-Krim. According to Stenroth, the Berbers were ‚Äúunbelievably brave and had a contempt for death‚Äù. At one point, it was already thought that Stenroth had died, but he managed to escape from the Berbers. The site of one battle was named Fort Stenroth in his honor. For his exploits in the war, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre, and he was promoted a lieutenant and mentioned in a dispatch, which is considered to be a special honor in France. He During 1928‚Äì30 Stenroth served in Libya and Syria. In October 1930, he was sent to H·∫£i Ph√≤ng in French Indochina, where he arrived in April 1931, in order to restrain local troubles. However, he fell ill with a tropical disease immediately after arrival and was transferred to a hospital in Hanoi, where he died on May 23.

In 2015, Cummings moved to Los Angeles after spending 30 years in the theatre as a professional actress, playwright, director, and then artistic director of her own theatre company in Upstate New York. In its final year, Cummings moved her theatre company from a black box theatre into an independent movie theatre, and it was during this time that she began to film her own plays in a simplistic, one-shot format, as well as film the trailers for the plays she directed and staged at the movie theatre. Cummings recognized she was merging her experiences from the theatre onto film so she moved to Los Angeles to continue to explore her style within the one-shot format. This quickly advanced into highly choreographed, 360 one-shot camera work for three seasons of the television series she created, wrote, and directed about an older woman and a much younger man called, ‚ÄúConversations in L.A.‚Äù. ‚ÄúConversations in L.A.‚Äù released on Amazon Prime, iTunes, and ConversationsinLA.com from 2017-2019, and in October, 2019, FandangoNOW picked up all three seasons and released them on their platform. Artistic career Cummings grew up in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and began acting on stage at the age of six, and after performing in multiple professional plays by the age of 16, she attended the drama program at Carnegie Mellon University. During her summers at Carnegie, she continued to study acting at Northwestern University and the British American Drama Academy in Oxford, England (BADA). At BADA, she attended lectures with Simon Callow, Jeremy Irons, the late Peggy Ashcroft, and the late Sir John Gielgud. At Northwestern, she studied Anton Chekhov‚Äôs plays, in depth, with the master of Chekhov - the late Earle R. Gister. Following her dramatic education, Cummings performed in regional theatres around the United States, but before that venture began, Peter Sylvester cast her in the role of Irina in ‚ÄúThe Three Sisters,‚Äù by Anton Chekhov, at Synchronicity Space in New York City. Subsequently, she worked at the Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas, with director Gregory Boyd (‚ÄúA Flea in Her Ear,‚Äù by Georges Feydeau), and with directors and writers Anne Bogart and Tina Landau (‚ÄúAmerican Vaudeville‚Äù). She then moved to Austin to perform in the role of Constanza in ‚ÄúAmadeus,‚Äù by Peter Schaffer and directed by Mark Ramont at the Capital City Playhouse, and to play the role of Puck in ‚ÄúA Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream,‚Äô directed by Anne Ciccolella at the Austin Shakespeare Festival. Cummings then traveled to Seattle and created her first theatre company, The Immediate Theatre. She teamed up with fight choreographer, and theatre and opera director, Chuck Hudson, who directed her in the role of Gregor in an avant-garde production of ‚ÄúThe Metamorphosis,‚Äù by Franz Kafka, and as Marie in ‚ÄúWoyzeck,‚Äù by Georg B√ºchner. Cummings enjoyed experimenting in the theatre and also teamed up with director Benji Bittle and played the role of Taylor (as a woman) from the play ‚ÄúK2,‚Äù by Patrick Meyers. For this production, a dance studio was turned into a mountain created by scaffolds, designed by Andrew Davidhazy, and Cummings trained for this role by summiting the 14,000 foot Mt. Rainier. Cummings also performed with established companies in the Seattle area: AHA! Theatre, Alice B. Theatre, the Seattle Shakespeare Company, the Seattle Children‚Äôs Theatre, the Seattle Opera, and the Seattle Repertory Theatre where she worked with Tony Award-Winning director, Doug Hughes. Hughes directed Cummings in the black box and mainstage productions of ‚ÄúVoir Dire,‚Äù by Joe Sutton, as well as a reading of the play at the New York Theatre Workshop in NYC. Mark Cuddy then cast and directed Cummings as Rosaura in ‚ÄúLife is a Dream,‚Äù by Pedro Calderon de la Barca at the Sacramento Theatre Company which inspired Edward Payson Call to cast Cummings as Antigone, in the Jean Anouih version of ‚ÄúAntigone‚Äù at the Cleveland Playhouse and GeVa Theatre. But it was at this point that Cummings moved back to New York City, and shifted her focus from acting to include playwriting and directing with performance readings of her plays ‚ÄúHelen of Purgatory,‚Äù ‚ÄúTouche!,‚Äù and ‚ÄúExtremes.‚Äù While Cummings directed most readings, she also worked with theatre directors Ludovica Villar-Hauser and Lucie Tiberghien. Performance readings of her plays took place all across the city: the Culture Project, the Cherry Lane, the Classic Stage Company, Vineyard Theatre, and SALAAM Theatre. Performance readings of her play ‚ÄúIndia Dreaming,‚Äù were directed by Leigh Fondakowski (‚ÄúThe Laramie Project‚Äù) and starred Indian movie stars, Madhur Jaffrey (‚ÄúVanya on 42nd Street‚Äù) and then Lillete Dubey (‚ÄúMonsoon Wedding‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel‚Äù). With further development, ‚ÄúIndia Dreaming‚Äù became ‚ÄúIndia Awaiting‚Äù and was performed Off-Broadway at the Samuel Beckett Theatre, starring Maulik Pancholy (‚Äú30 Rock‚Äù and ‚ÄúWeeds‚Äù), and directed by Tyler Marchant. Following the limited run of ‚ÄúIndia Awaiting,‚Äù Cummings made another shift ‚Äì she moved to Ithaca, in Upstate New York, to focus more intensely on her writing and directing. To make a living, Cummings worked as a columnist and journalist. As a columnist, she created the controversial column, ‚ÄúInstant Message‚Äù (for Gannett publications). This column interviewed youth and was written in first person as monologues about teens personal issues from eating disorders, to family dysfunction, to being bullied at school, to relationships, to school and learning, and so on. Also for Gannett, she wrote food reviews called, ‚ÄúIthaca Eats,‚Äù and for Tompkins Weekly, she wrote breaking news stories, each featuring her own photography. Yet during this time, Cummings continued writing plays. She wrote a new play, ‚ÄúSinkhole,‚Äù and had more performance readings of her play ‚ÄúExtremes‚Äù (a reading was held at Primary Stages, in NYC, starred Michael Cullen, ‚ÄúDead Man Walking‚Äù and Jessica Blank, ‚ÄúThe Exonerated‚Äù). She also made major revisions to ‚ÄúHelen of Purgatory‚Äù which then became the play ‚ÄúPurgatory Row‚Äù (with a performance reading starring Steppenwolf theatre actress, Kate Buddeke). She also created her second theatre company, The Readers‚Äô Theatre of Ithaca, which started in a book store and moved from one black box theatre after another with performance readings of modern plays such as ‚ÄúOleanna,‚Äù by David Mamet, ‚ÄúThe Mercy Seat,‚Äù by Neil LaBute, and ‚ÄúDetroit,‚Äù by Lisa D‚ÄôAmour. However, it was when Cummings moved The Readers‚Äô Theatre of Ithaca into Cinemapolis, the only independent movie theatre in Ithaca, that she began dabbling with theatre on film, as she called it. She wrote her play, ‚ÄúSoul Mates,‚Äù and filmed it in one-take at a diner. She then wrote and filmed a short called, ‚ÄúEasy Prey,‚Äù with each scene being filmed in one-take. For The Readers‚Äô Theatre of Ithaca, Cummings began to film trailers for the modern plays she directed which continued to be performed on a small stage she brought into one of the movie theatres. But it was after one year at Cinemapolis that Cummings decided to move to Los Angeles, CA, so that she could merge all of her experiences from the theatre as an actress, writer, director, artistic director, and producer, with her unique, one-shot vision for television and film.

It stars Austin Abrams and Lili Reinhart. It was released on August 21, 2020, by Amazon Studios, and received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot Teenager Henry Page considers himself a hopeless romantic but has never fallen in love. He aspires to be a writer and to be chosen as editor of his high school newspaper. The newspaper's faculty advisor disappoints him by making him share the editor position with Grace Town, a new student in his class. Grace is physically handicappedwalking with a limp and using a cane. She is also sullen and surly and initially rejects Henry's attempts to talk to her. After missing his bus one day, Henry and Grace wind up walking home along the same route. Although estranged at first, she relents slightly and offers to drive him home once they reach her house. However, she refuses to drive and has him drive her car and leave it at his house. The next day, a mysterious middle-aged man retrieves her car without speaking to Henry. As Grace begins to let Henry into her life, she shows him an abandoned factory with a pool containing koi fish. He falls in love with her despite her mixed signals and obvious indications that she is emotionally traumatized. He follows her one day and finds her at the grave of a man who, judging from the tombstone, died as a teenager. Upon further investigation, he learns that the dead man was killed in a car accident and that Grace had been in the car when it happenedcausing her disability and leading to her changing schools. Their romance peaks at a Halloween party, after which they have sex (and Henry loses his virginity). They have a romantic few days together, but Grace is still troubled. On the anniversary of the car accident, Henry goes to her house and learns that she has been living in the room of her deceased boyfriend, with his mother and father (the man who had picked up her car earlier). She finds Henry there and they argue as she is clearly still in love with a dead man. Henry cannot handle this information and they break up. One day, after being told by Dom‚Äôs Father that Grace is gone missing, Henry finds her in the koi pool, wearing what was to have been her wedding dress. He takes her back to her home. As Henry's and Grace's senior year comes to an end, they avoid talking to one another at the school. Grace leaves the newspaper after taking some time off school. After the last issue of the newspaper is released, to which Henry has contributed a heartfelt essay about the biochemistry of teenagers, they meet in a school hallway. Their encounter is an emotional one and they hug, but then go their separate ways. Cast * Austin Abrams as Henry Page * Lili Reinhart as Grace Town * Kara Young as Lola * Coral Pe√±a as Cora * C.J.

In June 2019, it was announced Lili Reinhart and Austin Abrams had joined the cast of the film, with Richard Tanne directing from a screenplay he wrote. Principal photography began in June 2019 in New Jersey. Release It was released on August 21, 2020 on Prime Video. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a Fresh Tomatometer rating of 62% based on 82 reviews, with an \\"All Critics\\" average rating of 5.79/10 and 65% from \\"Top Critics\\" based on 17 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"For better and for worse, Chemical Hearts captures the well-worn ups and downs of melodramatic teenage love - and countless other films about it.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" When Chemical Hearts premiered on Amazon Prime, it received a higher approval from audiences than critics. In her review, film critic Steph Cozza of Aggressive Comix speculated that the polarizing critical reaction was because ‚Äúthe general population of film critics have either forgotten what it was like to be young, or they have never suffered the melancholy of adolescence to begin with,‚Äù and that, ‚Äúthe film was not made for them, it was made for teenagers.‚Äù While some critics did not agree with Cozza's positive review of the film, the majority of Rotten Tomatoes \\"Top Critics\\" did, with praise going to Tanne's direction and screenplay, and the performances of Reinhart and Abrams. Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com described the film as \\"sneakily subversive,\\" and \\"very unpredictable,\\" writing that, \\"there's much to be said for what Tanne has pulled off in Chemical Hearts, for his gentle and measured approach. You actually feel like you have been through something by the end.\\" She added that \\"Lili Reinhart is a revelation. She has such gravitas as an actress,\\" and that, \\"Abrams is a thoughtful presence, and best when he's forced to deal with her unpredictable behavior. Watch his reactions. He's paying such close attention to her, trying to read her face. These two young actors make this bond make sense.\\" San Francisco Chronicle's G. Allen Johnson concluded his review by asserting that \\"what makes Chemical Hearts so good is it‚Äôs unafraid of its feelings. It tackles complicated emotional issues such as depression, suicide, sex and love with a straightforward honesty. For once, a film about young people is completely free of snark and irony.\\" Writing for Time, Stephanie Zacharek opined that the film \\"captures the joy and agony‚Äîand the lasting scars‚Äîof teenage romance.\\" David Ehrlich, reviewing for IndieWire, praised Tanne's direction of the film, writing that he employed \\"a more patient and open-ended aesthetic than you‚Äôd expect to find in a YA adaptation; shot on a 35mm stock that can make an entire bedroom vibrate with potential, some entire scenes are captured in just a handful of static medium-wide shots that aren‚Äôt afraid to set these characters adrift in a vast sea of their own feelings.\\" He wrote that the film \\"has an uncanny way of capturing the basic combustibility of teenage feelings.\\" References External links * Category:2020 films Category:2020 drama films Category:2020s coming-of-age drama films Category:2020 romantic drama films Category:Amazon Studios films Category:American coming-of-age drama films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films set in New Jersey Category:Films shot in New Jersey ","title":"Chemical Hearts"},{"id":"61064826","title":"La Romana (song)"},{"id":"61064840","text":"Hugh Rankin may refer to: * Hugh Doak Rankin (1878‚Äì1956), American artist * Sir Hugh Rankin, 3rd Baronet (1899‚Äì1988), British eccentric ","title":"Hugh Rankin"},{"id":"61064875","text":"Burberry handbag; Burberry is often cited as a mid-luxury fashion brand.

Background In 1950, Frankenthaler was exposed to the work of Jackson Pollock for the first time during an exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery where several of Pollock's paintings, Autumn Rhythm, Number 30, 1950 (1950), and Number One,1950 (Lavender Mist) (1950), were displayed. She was intrigued by the idea of painting a canvas lying flat on the floor, and would later employ that technique for Mountains and Sea. In the summer of 1952, Frankenthaler went on a road trip to Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, during which she painted landscapes there using foldable easel equipment. Mountains and Sea was painted after this trip, and while the painting is not a direct depiction of a coastline in Nova Scotia, it contains elements that suggest a kind of seascape or landscape, like the strokes of blue that join with areas of green.  Description  The New York Times described Mountains and Sea as, \\"a light-struck, diaphanous evocation of hills, rocks and water,\\" and the artist herself later said the canvas, \\"look[s] to many people like a large paint rag, casually accidental and incomplete.‚Äù To create Mountains and Sea, Frankenthaler placed an unprimed canvas directly onto the floor and stained color directly onto it by diluting oil paint with turpentine and allowing the colors to bleed. It was the first time she used this stain technique.  Influence  Mountains and Sea is considered an important precursor to color field painting and has been described as, \\"the Rosetta stone of color-field.\\" The canvas's impact on the color field movement has been compared to the importance of Claude Monet's Impression, Sunrise to the Impressionist movement. Morris Louis, an abstract expressionist painter and a contemporary of Frankenthaler, described the painting as, \\"a bridge between Pollock and what was possible.\\" The painting is on extended loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

Originally a British merchantman, she was built in England, captured by the French and brought into naval service in 1793. She served as a convoy escort until she ran aground in combat at Port Navalo and was scuttled by fire.  Service  In August 1793, the French Navy requisitioned R√©olaise at Bordeaux and brought her into naval service. She carried eighteen 4-pounder guns and under Enseigne de Vaisseau Tanay escorted convoys between Bordeaux and √éle de R√©. In 1794, she escorted convoys between Brest and Pasajes, before joining up with the fleet preparing for the Croisi√®re du Grand Hiver. After returning to Brest, R√©olaise resumed her escort duties, sailing between Brest and Pasajes. In February 1796, after Tanays was promoted to Lieutenant, she escorted convoys to the Pertuis d'Antioche, returning to Brest in August. In April 1797, R√©olaise was at Saint Martin de R√© to escort a convoy bound for Brest, and from there to ferry wine to Lorient. On 11 August she encountered a British squadron at Les Sables d'Olonne, but succeeded in escaping. She cruised under Tanays again in August 1799 in Quiberon Bay. Fate On 3 June 1800, R√©olaise departed Lorient under Lieutenant Chaunay-Duclos, escorting a 60-sail convoy bound for Nantes. On 16 November, in the Gulf of Morbihan, the convoy encountered a British squadron under Captain Sir Richard Strachan comprising the ship of the line , the frigate , and the three hired armed cutters Suworow, Nile, and Lurcher.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.529. After securing the merchantmen under her guard, R√©olaise fought a running battle and eventually ran aground near Port Navalo on 17 November. R√©olaise was then scuttle by fire, either by the British,Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, pp.507-8. or by her own crew. Chaunay received commendation for his action from Minister Forfait.

The tongue-in-cheek name of the award refers to a New England Journal of Medicine editorial that coined the term \\"research parasite\\" to disparage such work. The idea was first suggested on Twitter by Iowa State University researcher Iddo Friedberg shortly after the editorial was published, and was then brought to life by Casey Greene, a pharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania. Two Research Parasite Awards are given to recognize scientists who have made outstanding and rigorous contributions to analysis of secondary data in biology. Recipients must reuse data generated by someone else to extend, replicate, or disprove a research study in a reproducible manner. The junior parasite award recognizes an outstanding contribution from an early career scientist such as a postdoctoral, graduate, or undergraduate trainee. The senior parasitism award recognizes an individual who has engaged in exemplary research parasitism for a sustained period of time. Since the launch of the award in 2017, a travel grant to attend the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing has been provided to the junior parasite award winner by GigaScience. Starting for the 2019 award year the awards are supported in part by an endowment housed at the University of Pennsylvania. Timeline of the creation of the Research Parasite Award. From \\"Data detectives, self-love, and humility: a research parasite's perspective\\" by 2019 Junior award winner Claire Duvallet. The Research Symbiont Awards, inspired by the Research Parasite Award, was founded by J. Brian Byrd, a physician-scientist at the University of Michigan. Recognizing exemplars in the practice of data sharing, they are given to scientists working in any area of study who have shared data beyond the expectations of their field. Unlike a parasite, naming the data sharing award after symbionts helps stress that this process can be mutually beneficial to the data producing \\"host\\" because it increases the scientific impact of their investigators. Nomination and selection procedures Recipients self-nominate using a letter that references their published manuscripts that exemplify data reuse in a manner that enhances reproducibility. These published manuscripts should describe original scientific research that involves data re-use, or the secondary analysis of shared data and that extend, replicate, or disprove the results from the original manuscript describing the data. The nomination materials are reviewed by the Selection Committee, which is made up of at least 3 four-year term positions as well as the past two recipients of the Sustained Parasitism award.

It was completed in 1965 and is a Grade II listed building in the Modernist style which stands on the junction of St Paul's Avenue and Poolstock Lane. It is in the Wigan pastoral area of the Archdiocese of Liverpool. History =Foundation= Following the demolition of many working class homes in central Wigan in the early-to-mid 20th century there was a migration to new council estates on the outskirts of the town including new developments in the Poolstock and Worsley Mesnes localities. In order to cater to the Catholic inhabitants of the new estates Father Richard Tobin of St Joseph's parish in Wigan, established a chapel of ease (described as a \\"wooden hut\\") on St Paul's Avenue, Worsley Mesnes in 1959. In 1962 Tobin wrote to the Archbishop of Liverpool George Andrew Beck with his proposals for a new, permanent church, suggesting that the church should be dedicated either to St Jude or Our Lady of the Assumption. Beck replied on 15 March: > My dear Father Tobin, Many thanks for your letter. I like your suggestion of > St. Jude as a patron of the new church. We already have a parish in honour > of The Assumption but none, so far as I know, to St. Jude. I assume that you > do not intend to suggest by this title that Wigan is a hopeless case!! The Liverpool architects L A G Prichard & Sons were engaged and work began in the summer of 1963. Subsidence caused by coal mining in the area necessitated reinforced foundations and the final cost was over ¬£100,000. The foundation stone was laid by Archbishop Beck in December 1964 and the church was opened for worship in July 1965. =Description= The church was built of reinforced concrete and brick. It is fan-shaped, with the plan of an isosceles triangle with the corners squared off. On front of the entrance porch is a circular baptistry, surmounted by four tapering concrete fins holding a pole with a cross. The interior features a mosaic of the crucifixion measuring 17 feet by 9 feet designed by Hans Unger and made by Eberhard Schulze. The Stations of the Cross are represented by a series of mosaics with gold backgrounds designed and made by Earley and Company. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the church is the dalle de verre stained glass on the walls of the nave, designed by Robin Riley, made by Verriers de St Jobain in France and fitted by glaziers J O‚ÄôNeill and Sons. The abstract, swirling patterns are mainly in blue, red, yellow and green. Parish St Jude's absorbed the parish of St Joseph's Wigan, when the latter closed in 1995. The parish of St Jude's was united with the neighbouring parish of St Aidan's, Winstanley in 2017. The parish has two Sunday masses: 9:00 am at St Aidan's and 10:30 am at St Jude's.

The Abraaj Group bought a 49 per cent stake in the business in 2011. In January 2017, Simon Haslam, CEO of US payments processor Evalon replaced Bhairav Trivedi as CEO. The Abraaj Group sold its stake to Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic in 2015. In a deal worth $340 million, Network acquired Emerging Markets Payments (EMP) from Actis in March 2016, creating the largest payments processor in the MENA region, estimated as five times larger than CSC in Lebanon by Bhairav Trivedi, the CEO of Network at the time. It remains the largest payments processor in the region. In March 2019, Network announced its intention to float on the London Stock Exchange's main market, as well as the appointment of Ron Kalifa OBE, British payment's rival Worldpay's former CEO, as chairman. The company was the subject of an initial public offering in April 2019. It was the largest float of that year until that point, listing with a valuation of ¬£2.2 billion. Network International sold 40% of its shares at the IPO. In addition to this, Mastercard bought a cornerstone investment of $300 million, though the deal subject to a 9.99% limit, which it stated it would invest in shared projects with Network in the MENA region as part of the deal. Mastercard is now the fourth largest shareholder in Network International after General Atlantic, Warburg Pincus and Emirates NBD. While there were some concerns regarding Brexit's impact on market conditions Kalifa commented that the London IPO would not be troubled by Brexit, as Network's business is not reliant on the UK-EU relationship.

To help her regain memories, he shows her photos of her life, telling her that her parents died in a fire two years ago, that she had quit her job, and that she rarely talks to her friends anymore. Detective Frank Page (Dennis Haysbert), obsessed with his work after failing to find his own daughter's kidnapper, investigates Jennifer's accident, growing suspicious of Russell, who drives a truck similar to one seen in the vicinity where Jennifer was hit. After Jennifer is discharged, Russell takes her to their secluded home. Jennifer is haunted by brief flashes of memories from the rainy night of her accident. She becomes uneasy by Russell's strange behavior and realizes that he has been locking her inside the house at night. She also notices that most of the photos in her home have been manipulated. Frank's investigation leads him to Jennifer's parents' home, where he finds their rotting corpses. He learns from Jennifer's former employer that \\"Russell\\" is actually a man named Ryan Gaerity, a temperamental worker fired over two months ago. While Ryan is out, Jennifer finds her own ID in his wallet, which she uses to unlock his computer. She finds images of her actual husband Russell (Daniel Booko) and realizes the danger she's in. Before she can escape, Ryan knocks her unconscious and chains her to the bed while he goes out to get supplies. When he returns, the real Russell's corpse is revealed to be in his car trunk. Frank arrives at their home and tries to rescue Jennifer, but Ryan knocks him out, locking him in a freezer. He rants to Jennifer that he had loved her for years but her lack of reciprocation and marriage to Russell enraged him. Jennifer manages to escape into the forest with Ryan giving chase. Frank tackles him before he can shoot her, and Jennifer takes the gun and shoots Ryan in the arm. A wounded Ryan desperately attempts to run towards Jennifer to retrieve the gun, but Jennifer fires another shot, ultimately killing Ryan. Three months later, Frank gives Jennifer a note from her late husband that he had found during the investigation. As she drives, leaving for San Jose, Russell's voice narrates the note, telling her how much he loves her.

She writes, teaches, and organizes with National Women‚Äôs Liberation, a radical feminist organization of dues-paying women. Feminist movement work Brown began studying radical feminism with Gainesville Women‚Äôs Liberation (GWL), which was founded in 1968 and was the first women‚Äôs liberation group in the South. She also worked with the Redstockings of the Women's Liberation Movement, developing the Redstockings Archives for Action, a repository of women's liberation history and activist resources. In 2009, GWL and Redstockings collaboratively founded National Women's Liberation (NWL) and Brown became the national organizer of the new group. In 2019, Brown published Birth Strike: The Hidden Fight over Women‚Äôs Work,Brown, Jenny (2019). Birth Strike: The Hidden Fight over Women‚Äôs Work. Oakland: PM Press. in which she argues that the legal impediments to contraception and abortion access, rather than being discounted as products of prudish religious values, are better understood as a struggle over labor. The book argues that the ruling class, fearing the economic consequences of a declining birth rate, restricts access to contraception and abortion, intending to push more women into performing the labor of bearing and raising children. But women, she concludes, are engaged in a sort of labor strike‚Äì‚Äìrefusing to perform that labor in a world where they lack affordable healthcare, affordable childcare, paid work leave, job protections, and reliable male partners. Campaign for access to emergency contraception Brown was involved in the campaign to make Plan B, the ‚Äúmorning-after pill,‚Äù available over-the-counter in the United States. In 1999, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found Plan B safe and effective, but approved it only for prescription use.Tummino v. Torti, 603 F. Supp. 2d 519, 525 (E.D.N.Y. 2009). In 2001, a group of reproductive health professionals petitioned the FDA to make it available over-the-counter.Tummino v. Torti, 603 F. Supp. 2d at 526. The FDA eventually denied the petition in June 2006.Tummino v. Torti, 603 F. Supp. 2d at 523, 526. Brown and other NWL activists organized against the FDA. In January 2005, Brown was one of nine women arrested for a sit-in blocking access to the entrance of the FDA headquarters in Maryland, and was one the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that ultimately resulted in a federal court ruling, Tummino v. Hamburg, 936 F. Supp. 2d 162 (E.D.N.Y. 2013), requiring the FDA to make Plan B available over- the-counter, without a prescription and without age restrictions.Tummino v. Hamburg, 936 F. Supp. 2d 162 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) Brown and NWL continue to advocate for the expansion of access to emergency contraception, including by making it directly available on school campuses and pushing for universal health care. Labor movement work In Gainesville, Florida, Brown co-chaired the Alachua County Labor Party for ten years. She also worked as a writer and editor for Labor Notes and is a frequent contributor to Jacobin. Bibliography *Brown, Jenny (2019). Without Apology: The Abortion Struggle Now.

Biography  Kok was the son of captain Cornelius Kok I. He settled with his father in Griquatown and later in Campbell. After his father's death in 1820, Kok served as captain of Campbell until his older brother Adam Kok II returned from Griquatown. However, when Adam Kok II resigned as captain to join the Bergenaars, Cornelius Kok II resumed the title of captain again. In 1823, Cornelius Kok II, Adam Kok II, Andries Waterboer and Barend Barends won the Battle of Dithakong, as a result of which the Griqua were spared the terror of the Mfecane. The following year Cornelius Kok came into conflict with his brother and the Bergenaars, whom he defeated together with Waterboer near Fauresmith. However Kok's followers sided with the Bergenaars. To retain his leadership, he broke his ties with Waterboer, which then led to a new territorial conflict. Adam Kok II acted as a go-between, and a border was fixed between Waterboer's Griquatown and Cornelius Kok's Campbell. After the death of Adam Kok II, a succession battle arose between his sons: Abraham Kok, supported by Cornelius Kok II, and his nephew, Adam Kok III, who was supported by Waterboer. The petty civil war was won by Adam Kok III and Cornelius Kok II was deposed as captain, but in practice little changed. Andries Waterboer died in 1852, but his son Nicolaas Waterboer continued the territorial conflicts with Kok. In 1857, with the support of his followers, the old and sick Kok handed his territory over to Adam Kok III. He died early in 1858 in Campbell.  Literature  *E. J.

He lost his eyesight at his age of sixteen or seventeen, and from then on he began to compose epic songs of current events on the gusle.

After the fall of the First Serbian Uprising, and the invasion of Serbia by the Ottoman Turks, many refugees were taken from the borders of Serbian lands to be colonized on the large estates of the Serbian gentry in exile in Wallachia, Moldavia, Bessarabia and Imperial Russia. He first went to Graz and then to Bessarabia, with most Serbian emigrants. There, in 1816, he was instrumental in rejecting an offer to settle Serbs en masse permanently in the Dniester Canyon as immigrants.

Much of her career was spent in the employment of the National Park Service. Early life Story was from Chicago. Her sister was Eleanor Chittenden Cress. Career Story was employed with several governmental agencies, beginning with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1910, and then with the United States Geological Survey in 1911. In 1916, she began working at the National Park Service (NPS), where she remained until she retired in 1954. Although she was made Horace M. Albright's secretary in 1917, her college-level training in business made her well-suited to other tasks; in 1917, 1918, and 1919, she assisted Albright in creating annual reports for the National Park Service. She came to write press releases and articles promoting US National Parks, as well as writing speeches for officials at the United States Department of the Interior. For a time, she was the only staff writer for the NPS. In 1934, Story was made editor-in-chief. In this role, she went on to produce 39 radio programs on parks acquired since 1933. She directed the radio broadcast for the 25th anniversary of the NPS in 1941. In Story's early career, no other women were administrators at the NPS. In a 1934 group photograph of NPS administrators, Story was the only woman present among 78 men. In 1941, another group photograph showed Story along with Gertrude Cooper as superintendent. Story was a member of the Women's National Press Club and an accredited member of Eleanor Roosevelt's press corps, and wrote a weekly column called \\"Chatting With The First Lady\\". Story contributed articles to several major newspapers, including The New York Times. She also wrote periodically for Science Service and World Book Encyclopedia. Personal life Story lived with her widowed mother, to whom she devoted all her spare time. She had a romance with Park Service Superintendent Frank Pinkley, but he died of a heart attack before their planned wedding; Story never married. Story retired in 1954. Thereafter, she traveled extensively and participated in many activities until a severe hip injury (occurring while she was on a tour of the new Washington Star building in 1959) confined her to a wheelchair.

Approximately six months in to the expedition, Quesada, with two other Spanish captains, attempted to overthrow Magellan in the Easter mutiny at the South American port of St. Julian. The mutiny failed and Magellan had Quesada executed. Magellan expedition Little is known of Quesada's life before the Magellan expedition. A letter to Manuel I of Portugal from consul Sebasti√£o Alvares described Quesada as \\"a servant of the Archbishop [of Seville]\\". Charles I of Spain wrote that he had been \\"informed about his reputation and abilities\\". Quesada was appointed as captain by the archbishop Juan Rodr√≠guez de Fonseca (leader of the Casa de Contrataci√≥n), along with the expedition's other two Spanish captains, Juan de Cartagena and Luis Mendoza. These three captains despised Magellan, the expedition's Portuguese captain-general, and would go on to be the architects of the Easter mutiny. The expedition left Spain September 20, 1519, sailing west for South America. During a stop at the Canary Islands, Magellan received a secret message from his father-in-law, Diogo Barbosa, warning him that the Spanish captains were planning to mutiny. Later, during the Atlantic crossing, following the trial of a sailor caught in an act of sodomy, Magellan met with his captains to discuss their route. During the meeting, Cartagena became increasingly disrespectful to Magellan, eventually declaring he would no longer take orders from the captain-general. At this, Magellan grabbed Cartagena and declared him under arrest. In response, Cartagena called on Quesada and Mendoza to retaliate against Magellan (an incitement to mutiny). Quesada and Mendoza held back. After the confrontation, Cartagena was briefly put in stocks, but Quesada and Mendoza persuaded Magellan to release Cartagena, and allow him to be confined to the Victoria (under command of Mendoza). The expedition landed at Rio de Janeiro December 1519, where they stayed for two weeks. After an incident in which Cartagena was allowed to leave the Victoria to come ashore (possibly to join in the orgiastic celebrations taking place with the natives, or as part of another mutiny plot), Magellan considered marooning Cartagena, but instead had him transferred into the custody of Quesada aboard the Concepci√≥n. After leaving Rio de Janeiro in late 1519, the fleet sailed south along the coast for three months, searching for a passage around or through the continent. When the weather conditions became intolerable, the fleet anchored on March 31 at a natural harbor they called Saint Julian, located in modern-day Argentina. There they planned to wait out the winter before resuming their search for a strait. =Easter mutiny= Along with Juan de Cartagena and Luis Mendoza, Quesada was one of the principal architects of the Easter mutiny at St. Julian which took place from April 1 to 2. The mutiny began around midnight of April 1, when Quesada and Cartagena covertly led thirty armed men aboard the San Antonio, moving from the Concepci√≥n in a skiff. They seized control of the San Antonio, with Quesada stabbing and mortally wounding Juan de Elorriaga, the ship's boatswain, who resisted the mutineers. Quesada declared himself captain of the San Antonio, with Cartagena returning to command the Concepci√≥n. With the Victoria commanded by Mendoza, the mutineers controlled three of the fleet's five ships. Magellan successfully fought back against the mutineers, first by having Mendoza killed and taking control of the Victoria, then blocking the harbor to prevent the Concepci√≥n and San Antonio from escaping. Quesada apparently intended to flee at dawn on April 3, but before daybreak, the San Antonio had drifted close to Magellan's flagship, the Trinidad, and a boarding party was able to board the San Antonio, where they found Quesada roaming the quarterdeck in full armor, carrying a lance and shield. Quesada and his co-conspirators were arrested, and the remaining crew of the San Antonio pledged allegiance to Magellan. Differing explanations have been offered for why the San Antonio fell into Magellan's lap, including: * A strong ebb tide * Wanting to get a quick start at dawn, Quesada raised three of the ship's four anchors. The single remaining anchor was insufficient to prevent the ship from drifting. * Other accounts claim that Magellan sent a single sailor in a skiff to the San Antonio to cut its anchor cable. He may have been allowed aboard because he claimed to be a defector, or by Magellan loyalists on the San Antonio. Death Following the Easter mutiny, Magellan held a court martial, sentencing Quesada to death (the other surviving Spanish captain, Juan de Cartagena, was sentenced to be marooned). Unable to find a volunteer executioner, Magellan offered to commute the sentence of Quesada's squire, Luis Molino, if he would perform the duty. Molino agreed, and on April 7 1520, Quesada was beheaded. His and Mendoza's bodies were quartered and the parts impaled and displayed on gibbets as a warning. Later, Sir Francis Drake reportedly found the gibbets when he tried and executed Thomas Doughty at St. Julian in 1578.

Some of the concepts were brought over from Amsterdam where goldsmiths would provide gold storage and issue chits that started to be used as a means of exchange. The goldsmith banker became a key development in the history of banking that would lead to modern banking. History Their emergences was gradual: exchanging goldsmiths, who dealt in coinage, started to become recognised as carrying out a different activity from a working goldsmith in the 1630s. Prior to that date banking in London was principally carried out by foreigners, generally Italians, Germans, and the Dutch. However this innovation led to an indigenous banking tradition. With the seizure of the mint by Charles I in 1640 created anxiety about the safe storage of valuables which was further increased during the English Civil War, which also disrupted the regular work of the working goldsmiths. They soon developed accountancy practices to keep track of deposits. Then they also started paying interest on deposits so they could loan out increasing quantities of gold. The depositor was given a receipt with their name and the amount of the deposit. Such receipts became negotiable and thus evolved into the bank note. Whereas before the Civil War the London goldsmith bankers had largely been creditors, following the restoration in 1660 they became the biggest debtors in England. As the system evolved, the goldsmith bankers developed a form of Fractional reserve banking, which whilst still restricted as individuals, as a group enabled them as a group to create credit out of thin air. In the 1660s George Downing, the Secretary of the Treasury implemented a project outlined by Sir William Killigrew designed to side-step the power of the Goldsmith bankers. In A proposal, shewing how this nation may be vast gainers by all the sums of money, given to the Crown, . . . (1663) Killigrew had advocated that the government issue ¬£2m in transferable bonds with the interest being covered by a yearly tax of ¬£300k. The bonds would be for denominations between ¬£5 and ¬£100, mostly in the smaller denominations. The state would provide a regulatory framework to avoid fraud and ensure they were accepted as legal tender. However, by 1672 most of the orders were in the hands of a handful of such bankers, and so ended up increasing their power.

It was intended to mark his grave and honour his memory by enumerating his bravery in a battle near the river Arachthos in the location of ancient Amvrakia, modern-day Arta. The stele was found in 1846 at the necropolis of the Corfu Palaiopolis in the suburb of Garitsa, near the Tomb of Menecrates, after a demolition of Venetian fortifications in the area by the British, who at the time ruled Corfu. The date of the stele is early 6th century BC. The stele bears an epigram written vertically in verses following an alternating direction writing style called boustrophedon. The inscription describes the details of the death of warrior Arniadas in a battle near ships on the banks of the river Arachthos and praises the dead warrior's bravery. The Homeric hexameter of the verses, the proximity of the battle to ships, and the pompous style of the writing are clear indications that the inscription was influenced by the writings of Homer. Such inscriptions were common for that era, and exist in other funerary inscriptions in Corfu of that time. The Stele of Arniadas is exhibited at the Archaeological Museum of Corfu. Discovery and description The funerary Lion of Menecrates found near his tomb and originally thought to belong to his cenotaph, may have belonged to the tomb of Arniadas. The stele was found in 1846 at the necropolis of the Corfu Palaiopolis, in the suburb of Garitsa, near the Tomb of Menecrates, after a demolition of the Venetian-era fortifications in the area by the British, who at the time ruled Corfu. The stele has been dated to the early 6th century BC. It is 0.55 m wide and 1.90 m high and made of limestone. The four holes on the stone functioned as lifting points, assisting in the process of lifting the stele and placing it on the tomb. There is also speculation that the Lion of Menecrates, found near his tomb, may actually belong to the tomb of Arniadas. Inscription There is an ancient inscription on the stele. It is written in boustrophedon, a writing system with text alternating in reading direction in each successive line. The inscription contains four verses written in Homeric hexameter, and it is written vertically. The inscription reads as follows: The ancient inscription translates as: Analysis of the inscription The display of the Stele of Arniadas at the Corfu Archaeological Museum Scholars have analysed the epigram and have found clear Homeric influence. A. Petrovic states that the inscription has been \\"directly influenced\\" by a passage from the Iliad. The pompous style of the inscription and the epic attributes of the verses indicate that there was a competition among epigram writers aiming at making their inscriptions and monuments distinctive. Grave epigrams of soldiers during the archaic and classical periods follow the structure of Hector's words in the Iliad. The characteristics of Hector's message include a varying sequence of the designation \\"Œ§œåŒ¥Œµ œÉ·øÜŒºŒ±\\" (Ionian form (\\"This sign/marker/monument\\")) or \\"Œ§œåŒ¥Œµ œÉ·æ∂ŒºŒ±\\" (Doric form) or in reverse order \\"Œ£·æ∂ŒºŒ± œÑœåŒ¥Œµ\\" etc., and the possessive form (genitive) of the name of the warrior, followed by the description of the warrior's bravery as excellent (·ºÄœÅŒπœÉœÑŒµœçŒøŒΩœÑŒ±), and brief details of his death. A number of academics have used Arniadas's inscription as an example which follows the Homeric formula. Hans- Martin Lumpp is considered the first scholar to suggest that Arniadas's epigram was directly related to Hector's words in the Iliad. Anthony Raubitschek states that the verses are \\"extraordinarily similar\\" to the pronouncements of Hector. Paul Friedl√¢nder and Herbert B, Hoffleit describe the epigram as \\"the masterpiece among...sepulchral [epigrams] in epic manner\\". There is a difference between the death of Arniadas and that of Menecrates as evidenced by the inscriptions on their tombs. Arniadas's death appears heroic since he was slain by Ares himself, the god of war, while Menecrates was simply lost at sea. There is also uncertainty about the term \\"œáŒ±œÅŒøœÄœåœÇ\\" (\\"Charopos\\" (bright-eyed)), a fact that makes the exact syntactic analysis of the epigram challenging. It is unclear if Arniadas is the son of Charops, or vice versa, or even if Charops is a member of a group called Arniadai. Also, \\"œáŒ±œÅŒøœÄœåœÇ\\" is not used as an adjective for the god of war Ares in epic poetry. The latter makes the epigram's connection to the Homeric epics tenuous. The inscription is described as having a \\"grand epic style\\" which \\"all but transports [Arniadas] to the Island of the Blessed\\", without providing any details of the dead warrior's life before he died fighting.

The ceremony of dates back to 1381 and is held each year in June. During the ceremony a single red rose is snipped from the garden in Seething Lane, placed on an altar cushion from All Hallows-by-the-Tower and carried in procession to the Mansion House where it is presented to the Lord Mayor of London. History Sir Robert Knolles (c. 1325 ‚Äì 15 August 1407) was an important English knight of the Hundred Years' War and was a prominent citizen of London. He owned a house on the West side of 'Syendenlane in the Parish of All Hallows Berkying-churche', now called Seething Lane. While he was away, possibly in 1380, his wife, Constance, purchased the threshing ground on the East side of the road opposite their house and turned it into a rose garden. She then built a footbridge over the lane from her house to her garden. The Corporation of London imposed a fine of one red rose payable each year on the feast of St. John the Baptist. The Lord Mayor at the time was Sir William Walworth. The official record says ‚ÄúTo all persons who these present letters shall see or hear, the Mayor Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of London Greeting, know ye that we have granted unto Messire Robert Knolles Knight, our dear and well beloved fellow citizen, and to Constance his wife, leave to make a Haut-pas of the height of 14 feet extending from the house of the said Robert and Constance his wife on the west side thereof to another house to them belonging on the east side thereof, beyond the lane of Syvendenlane in the parish of All Hallows Berkyngechirche, near the Tower of London, rendering yearly to the Chamberlain of the Guild Hall of the said City for the time being one red rose at the feast of St. John the Baptist.‚Äù The Ceremony The ceremony is now carried out as one of the City's traditions. The Company of Watermen and Lighters is based at its Georgian Hall at St Mary-at-Hill and organises the ceremony. The ceremony starts at All Hallows-by-the-Tower and makes its way to the garden at Seething Lane where the rose is cut. The rose is then placed on an altar cushion and carried in procession to the Mansion House where it is presented to the Lord Mayor. The escort for the rose consists of the Master of the Company of Watermen and Lighters, the Verger of All Hallows-by-the-Tower accompanied by the Vicar, Churchwardens, and Beadle. The ceremony was revived in 1924 by the Vicar of All Hallows-by-the-Tower and has been arranged by the Company of Watermen and Lighters since 1960. The garden in Seething Lane, which has connections with Samuel Pepys, was formerly owned by the Port of London Authority and reopened in 2018 as part of the redevelopment of Trinity Square. The garden includes a subterranean car park and rainwater from the roof of 10 Trinity Square is used for irrigation.

In the societal structure of the Bouzouk, there was a King and a Council of Wisemen, seven mystics who had successfully maintained universal harmony by guarding the Chprotznog, a sacred containment unit used to channel and subsequently trap evil spirits. Having failed to learn their lesson from last time, the humans engaged waged war on the Bouzouk tribe in what is known as \\"The Great Battle\\". In a day, the humans destroyed the Bouzouk civilization, hurting many innocent civilians and looting their holy artifacts.

It is his second novel, published five years after his New York Times best seller, Rules of Civility (2011).  Background  The protagonist is fictional Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, born in Saint Petersburg, Russia on 24 October 1889. He was raised on his Rostov family's estate \\"Idlehour\\" in Nizhny Novgorod. Rostov's godfather was his father's comrade in the cavalry, Grand Duke Demidov. When the Count's parents died of cholera within hours of each other in 1900, Grand Duke Demidov became the 11-year-old's guardian. Demidov counseled him to be strong for his sister Helena, because \\"...adversity presents itself in many forms, and if a man does not master his circumstances, then he is bound to be mastered by them.\\"A Gentleman in Moscow (2016), p18. The Rostov siblings are aristocrats, making social visits to nearby estates by horse-drawn troika or sleigh. As a young man, the Count was sent out of the country (as was the custom at the time) by his grandmother for wounding Helena's suitor, a cad who broke her heart. Upon returning home from Paris after the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, the Count was arrested.  Inspiration and plot  Towles's inspiration for the novel was his experience staying at luxury hotels, specifically, a hotel in Geneva, Switzerland where some guests were permanent residents. He combined the idea of luxury hotels with his knowledge of Russia's long-time historical tradition of house arrest. = The trial = The Count is charged as a social parasite before a Bolshevik tribunal, with the expectation that he will be found guilty and shot. He is unrepentant, and eloquently refuses to confess. Because of a revolutionary poem attributed to him, the Count is spared a death sentence. Instead, he is placed under house arrest for life at his current residence, the Hotel Metropol in central Moscow. = The hotel = A military guard escorts the Count back to the Hotel Metropol Moscow, where he is ordered to vacate his luxurious suite and move to the cramped servant's quarters on the sixth floor. While working as a hotel waiter, the Count cultivates a social circle of friends from his youth as well as selected residents, staff, and customers of the Hotel and its restaurants. These include a one-eyed cat, a young girl, a seamstress, a French chef, a ma√Ætre d'hotel and former circus juggler, a poet, an actress, an underemployed architect, an orchestra conductor, a prince, a former Red Army colonel, and an aide-de-camp of an American general. Due to his diminished circumstances and restricted freedom, the Count has time for self-reflection. He is a brilliant conversationalist, readily discussing diverse subjects such as evolution, philosophy, Impressionism, Russian writers and poetry, food, post-revolutionary Russian society, and Russia's contributions to the world. An early acquaintance at the hotel is nine-year-old Nina Kulikova, the daughter of a widowed Ukrainian bureaucrat who is fascinated by princesses. = Sofia = In 1938, an unexpected arrival changes the Count's circumstances. Nina Kulikova, now a married woman, visits the Count. She confides that her husband Leo was arrested and sentenced to five years of forced labor by the Gulag. Nina decides to follow her husband to Sevvostlag in Kolyma, a remote region of the Soviet Union bounded by the East Siberian Sea and the Arctic Ocean. She begs the Count to accept temporary custody of her young daughter Sofia, while she makes arrangements for the child to join her in Siberia to be near her father. This is the last time the Count sees Nina, so at the age of 49, he becomes Sofia's surrogate father. Sofia is a quiet, highly intelligent child. Her potential manifests itself during games of hide-and-seek that she wins in record time. Later, Sofia takes piano lessons. She surprises the Count by playing a Chopin nocturne (Opus 9, number 2, in E-flat major) after only a few lessons. It is clear to both the piano teacher and the Count that Sofia is a musical prodigy.  Analysis  Towles's approach in A Gentleman in Moscow was described as a \\"gorgeous sleight of hand\\" by The New York Times. \\"What saves the book is the gorgeous sleight of hand that draws it to a satisfying end, and the way he chooses themes that run deeper than mere sociopolitical commentary: parental duty, friendship, romance, the call of home. Human beings, after all, 'deserve not only our consideration but our reconsideration' ‚Äî even those from the leisured class. Who will save Rostov from the intrusions of the state if not the seamstresses, chefs, bartenders, and doormen? In the end, Towles's greatest narrative effect is not the moments of wonder and synchronicity but the free transformation of these peripheral workers, over decades, into confidants, equals, and, finally, friends. With them around, a life sentence in these gilded halls might make Rostov the luckiest man in Russia.\\" Reception Kirkus Reviews found the book to be \\"a great novel, a nonstop pleasure brimming with charm, personal wisdom, and philosophic insight. This book more than fulfills the promise of Towles' stylish debut, Rules of Civility.\\" NPR opined that \\"A Gentleman in Moscow is a novel that aims to charm ... and the result is winning, stylish ... Flair is always the goal ‚Äî Towles never lets anyone merely say goodbye when they could bid adieu, never puts a period where an exclamation point or dramatic ellipsis could stand.\\" At Book Marks, a review aggregator website, the novel received a cumulative \\"Positive\\" rating based on 11 reviews: 3 \\"Rave\\", 5 \\"Positive\\", and 3 \\"Mixed\\". A Gentleman in Moscow was a finalist for the 2016 Kirkus Prize in Fiction & Literature. It was also an International Dublin Literary Award nominee (2018 longlist). The audiobook, narrated by Nicholas Guy Smith, was an AudioFile Magazine Earphones Award winner in 2016.

She lived at the mission in Urmia, Iran from 1835 to 1857; her husband Justin Perkins was also a missionary.  Biography  Charlotte Bass was born in Middlebury, Vermont to William and Fidelia Bass. She attended Ipswich Female Seminary in 1832 and married Justin Perkins in July 1833. Earlier that year, Justin had accepted a commission to work among the ‚ÄúNestorians‚Äù (Assyrian Church of the East members, also referred to as East Syriac Christians) from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. In September 1833, Justin and Charlotte departed the United States from Boston, ultimately destined for Persia. They stayed with other missionaries in Istanbul, Turkey for five months before moving on in May 1834. Charlotte Perkins became the first American woman to cross the Black Sea during their continued journey. She also delivered her first child during their journey on August 26, 1834 while in Tabriz, Iran. She was ill and unaware of the birth of her daughter for the first three days. Charlotte survived, though her husband later said that she never did fully recover from the effects of this illness. Eventually, the Perkinses, along with Asahel Grant and Judith Grant, arrived in November of 1835 to Urmia, where they would establish their mission. Justin and Charlotte remained at the Urmia Mission from then until July 1841 when they left to journey to the United States on account of Charlotte‚Äôs health. They reached New York in January 1842 and remained in the United States until in March 1843 they again left to return to the mission in Urmia. Charlotte continued to live and work at the mission until 1857. By then, she had had seven children: four who died before the age of 1, one who died at age 3, one who died at age 12, and one who would live into adulthood. The loss of her twelve-year old daughter Judith Grant Perkins especially effected Charlotte‚Äôs health and well-being. In September 1857 Charlotte and her only surviving son, Henry Martyn Perkins, left Urmia to return to the U.S. on account of her health and for his education. Justin returned to the United States in 1858. When Justin again left the United States to return to Persia in 1862, Charlotte was committed to the McLean Asylum for the Insane in Somerville, Massachusetts. In 1863 she wrote a letter to the directors asking that she be released, but this request was denied.Shedd, Susan Flint. Letter to Justin Perkins. 23 April 1863.

It was constructed in 1965 and housed the Spanish government's official exhibition and cultural center.  History  The Government of Spain purchased the lot on St. George Street with the intent to reconstruct a 17th- century Spanish colonial structure to contribute to the Restoration Area, a historic preservation project being undertaken by the State of Florida in advance of the 400th anniversary of St. Augustine's founding. This lot was adjacent to the lot on which the Marin-Hassett House, which housed the Pan- American Center (sponsored by the Organization of American States), would be reconstructed, and directly adjacent to the plot of land that became the Hispanic Garden. The structure that was located on the property prior to the construction of the Casa del Hidalgo was the Weinstein building. It was a three-story wooden structure that served as a grocery store, and was demolished in 1964 to make way for construction on the new building.  Construction and Dedication  The cornerstone of the Casa del Hidalgo was laid by Don Manuel Fraga, Spain's Minister of Information and Tourism, on October 19, 1964. The cornerstone was taken from the former home of Pedro Menendez, founder of St. Augustine, in Aviles, Spain. Prior to its arrival in St. Augustine, the stone had been displayed at the New York World's Fair in both the Spanish Pavilion and the Florida Pavilion. The building was designed by Spanish architect Javier Barroso, and the construction work was completed by Butler Building and Contracting. The two story, 10,000 square foot house was constructed of coquina. The Casa del Hidalgo cost $200,000 to build, and was dedicated in September 1965 by Lieutenant Colonel Camilo Alonso Vega, Spain's Minister of the Interior. Other dignitaries in attendance at the dedication included U.S. Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, Florida Governor Haydon Burns, and Senator Spessard Holland. Local participants in the ceremony included Herbert E. Wolfe, Director of the National Quadricentennial Commission, Earle Newton, Executive Director of the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission, St. Augustine Mayor John D. Bailey, and Archbishop Joseph Hurley, who blessed the building.  Exhibition and Cultural Center  Immediately after irs dedication, the Casa del Hidalgo was opened to the public. It was managed by Joaquin Pujol, the assistant director of the Spanish National Tourist Office. There was no admission charge, and the exhibition center was open seven days a week. It was housed with rotating exhibits provided by the Spanish government, with many of the artifacts on display coming from the 1964 World's Fair, including decorative arts and other Spanish crafts. In addition to an exhibit space, the Casa del Hidalgo also housed a tourism office for those interested in visiting Spain.

There is also a legend about Radov, a daring man of the Drevlian tribe, in whose honor the village was allegedly named. No specific date for the establishment of the village was found. However, in the Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland and Other Slavic Territories, a former graduate of the Radowell School Nadiia Herhalo found the following information: \\"Village Radowell, Ovruch district, Zhubrovychi parish, 99 miles away from Ovruch, 142 houses, 849 inhabitants, a wooden church, built in 1862. In 1496, Radowell was given to Prince Tymofii Ivanovych Kapusta by King Alexander, in 1581 - to Bohdan Sapeha\\". Thus, in 1496, the village of Radowell already existed. Therefore, \\"the first mention of a village Radov in the Ukrainian archives, dated 1545, is not exact\\". In the second half of the 17th century, Yosef Karol Nemyrych gave Radowell a monastery of Carmelites in Olevsk. In 1694, Alexander Nemyrych became the owner of Radowell. In the 18th century, the village was part of the Volhynian Voivodeship and then that of the Volhynia province (1795), which became part of the Russian Empire and was the most backward margin of the South-Western region of Russia. In 1831 Radowell transformed into a state estate, under the category of state-owned villages. At that time, the village belonged to the Olevsk parish, though, in 1866, it was readministered to the Zhubrovychi and then to the Bilokorovychi parish. Radowell saw such historical events as the Stolypin agrarian reform (in 1906, there were 1,000 people and 156 farms in the villagehttp://leb.nlr.ru/edoc/324107), national liberation movement of 1917-1921, the Holodomor, Soviet rule, Chernobyl (the village was classified in the third category of those impacted by the disaster) and the restoration of Ukraine's independence. Today, the project \\"Radowell\\" is being implemented in the village.  Social sector  In the village there is a school, an \\"Ukrpost\\" post office, an outpatient department and pharmacy, a village club with a library and ethnographic museum, as well as a village council (which unites Radowell, Rudnia-Radowellska and Poiasky civil communities). = Education = Biotechnological Lyceum \\"Radowell\\" alt= Biotechnological Lyceum ‚ÄúRadowell‚Äù was opened on September 15 in the village Radowell. It was reorganized from Radowell Secondary School I-III ranking. The institution is adapted to adapted to children with special needs. It has a modern design and innovative equipment consisting of more than 10 studios, namely robotics, taekwon-do, pottery, drama club, culinary studio, choreography etc). As of February 2019, 330 students study at the Lyceum. Preschool education is represented by the kindergarten No. 20. There are three groups in ‚ÄúStrumok‚Äù (nursery, middle and junior), the language of education is Ukrainian. The facility is designed to hold up to 90 students. = Health Care = Ambulance car At present in the village there is a pharmacy, a temporary outpatient clinic, as well as an emergency first aid facility ‚Äî a modern reanimobile with innovative equipment. The old outpatient clinic was dismantled on December 8, and the construction of the new one began on December 24. The ongoing construction of the outpatient clinic is a part of the ‚ÄúRadowell‚Äù project. = Culture = The statue of a mother and child Narodoznavcha svitlytsia. Museum The present-day village club has been in operation since 1981. All year around it hosts various cultural events dedicated to holidays and other important celebrations. Since 1995, there has been an amateur ensemble folk dance \\"Rado\\", which is a regular participant of amateur concerts and district festivals. In 2014, the singing band \\"Svitanok\\" was founded. The club has a village library and a local museum ‚Äî Narodoznavcha svitlytsia, where artifacts of national importance are collected. Among the exhibits there are embroidered towels, spinning wheels, a workbench for the production of textiles, a variety of vintage products and zhen (a leather rope used for wild beekeeping). Some locals still collect wild honey. Among cultural memorials in the village, there is a statue of a mother and child, located in the center. It is sculpted by M.M. Barynova, a graduate of Radowell Secondary School. There is also a memorial in honor of S.K. Tur, a commander of a partisan group, and other fellow villagers who had participated in World War II. On February 25, 2016, a new church was opened. It was funded by the local community and other sponsors. Initially, the church was built in 1862 with state funds, and at that time was named in honor of the Resurrection of Christ. In the second half of the 20th century, the church was burned down.

Ekines first project was proposed to William of Orange on 16 January during England's Glorious Revolution in which William became the King of England and drew England into the Nine Years' War against France. He proposed that he be assigned the temporary command of a Dutch ship with the goal of capturing the French ship St. John of Rochelle which was lying off the Isles of Scilly with a reputed value ¬£20,000. In the end he proceeded to capture the French vessel but was obliged to release it whilst gaining no reward and leaving him in debt. Ekines then took charge of a frigate as part of the Post Office Packet Service new station at Falmouth, carrying mail to Corunna, Spain. However he was obliged to give up the post due to illness. Ekines went on to take command of HMS Woolwich and in this capacity seized a Dutch ship in Plymouth. He claimed the ship was trading with enemies of Queen Anne, Britain being involved in the War of the Spanish Succession. Whilst his right to seize the ship was upheld, his seizure for personal gain of much of the cargo was condemned and blocked his progression in the Navy. In 1705 Ekines joined the Earl of Peterborough's expedition to Spain and served for nine months as an unpaid volunteer. Early on in the campaign he proposed that he lead an expedition of five ships and 1,000 soldiers across the Atlantic to seize Buenos Aires. However this project foundered after Peterbrough took Barcelona. Then in 1707 he offered his services to the Board of Trade and Plantations to take command of a ship to attack pirates at Martinique and Guadeloupe. The response was that the Board did not appoint individual officers. Ekines next project was an expedition to confront the Spanish in South America. Sidney Godolphin, Lord High Treasurer and Earl of Sunderland, Secretary of State for the Southern Department (whose responsibilities included the American colonies) expressed interest in this project, but wanted to have the project administered and financed by a consortium of merchants. Ekines rejected this, as he was concerned he would no longer be in charge of the expedition. In fact whilst there was the potential for plunder, as the war aims of the British was to secure the Spanish thrown for Archduke Charles, there was little prospect of long-term territorial gains for Britain.

It stars Saif Ali Khan as a 40 year-old father and debutant Alaya Furniturewala as his daughter, alongside Tabu. The film revolves around Jazz, a property broker and party animal in London, who has to confront a daughter he never knew he had, who is also pregnant. Principal photography of the film took place from 14 June to 24 August 2019 in London, England. It was theatrically released in India on 31 January 2020 to mixed-to-positive reviews. It grossed ‚Çπ45 crore worldwide to emerge as one of Khan's more successful small-budget films. Plot Jaswinder \\"Jazz\\" Singh (Saif Ali Khan) is a 40-year-old carefree womaniser who works in London as a property broker during the day with his brother Dimpy (Kumud Mishra) and parties at night in a bar owned by his friend Rocky (Chunky Pandey), usually taking whichever girl agrees to go to his home for a one- night stand. Jazz, along with his brother Dimpy, has to negotiate a multi- million-pound deal involving a property in Hounslow, but his aged landlady Malika (Kamlesh Gill) refuses to part with her home, and his repeated attempts to convince her to give it up for the new construction do not succeed. One night, Jazz is partying as usual when a girl spills her drink on him; she apologises and he carries on. The next night, at the bar, she reveals herself to him as Tia (Alaya Furniturewala), a 21-year-old Amsterdammer who has come to London for some personal work, as she puts it. He agrees to take her to his home. There, Tia tells him that she is on a quest to find her long-lost father, and that Jazz is one of three possible options, based on a photograph of Tia's mother with him. When she tells him that she might be his daughter, he is aghast, but she advises him to take a DNA test to confirm the results. When the results arrive, it transpires that not only is Tia Jazz's daughter, but she also happens to be pregnant. A shocked Jazz initially refuses to accept the truth; when Tia offers to stay with him and deliver her baby at his home, he refuses, saying that he cannot take on the responsibility of running a family. She moves in next door to his house. He consults his hairdresser friend Rhea (Kubbra Sait), who is his age, for advice. She congratulates him and advises him to confront his being not only a father but also an impending grandfather. His reckless partying ways continue at personal expense, as once he falls from a bar table, drunk, and breaks his leg. His feelings for Rhea grow, but when he tries to have sex with her at her home, she stops him and asks him to give up his lecherous ways, and instead to be a good friend and nothing more. Meanwhile Tia visits Jazz at his home regularly, and silently resolves to endear herself to his family. One night Jazz's brother Dimpy and their parents visit his home. Despite Jazz warning her against it, Tia embraces everyone, and catches them unawares when she shows them her sonogram on Jazz's projector, forcing him to explain the situation. When they leave, an elated Tia tells Jazz that she had come in search of a father but instead found a family. Tia also convinces his landlady Malika to agree to the property deal and part with her house, which she accepts on the condition that a willow tree, that she has grown with since her childhood, not be touched. The two happily live through her pregnancy, until one day when Tia's hippie mother Ananya (Tabu) and Tia's boyfriend Rohan turn up from Amsterdam unannounced. Ananya and Rohan's hippie, drug-fuelled, wanton ways are too much for Jazz to handle, and he fears that this may impact Tia's delivery. One day Jazz and Dimpy are celebrating the launch of their new prime property in Hounslow, when Tia arrives and notices in the model of the property that the willow tree is missing. Hurt, she leaves; when Jazz confronts her, and attempts to convince her that the millions to be gained from the property will more than compensate for the lost tree, she tells him tearfully that, instead of a father, she has found a property broker. Tia, Ananya and Rohan proceed to leave Jazz's house to catch a train to Amsterdam, which leaves the next day. A despondent Jazz ponders over whether the deal is really worth aggrieving an old lady, before he finally decides to call off the Hounslow project, even at the expense of money, to which Dimpy agrees.

With this machine 15 GPs, 2 Driver Championships and 2 manufacturers World Championships were won. Evolution MV Agusta had started participating in road racing with motorcycles in the late 1940s and initially concentrated on the 125 and 500 cc classes. Piero Remor built the 125 \\"Bialbero\\" (\\"twin-cam\\") for the 125 cc class. The machine was subsequently bored to 175 cc because that class was still very popular in Italy and almost all major brands built production racers for it. The 175 cc machine was further bored to slightly above 200cc, so that in 1955 it was possible to compete in the 250cc class with the MV Agusta 203 Bialbero. After one race the capacity was further increased to 220cc. With that machine, Bill Lomas completed the 1955 season, finishing in third place in the World Championship. MV Agusta also won the constructor's title. In 1956 the machine was finally further developed into a fully-fledged 250cc racer, but that was not possible by further boring of the cylinder, so the stroke was increased from 56 mm to 60 mm. Technical The engine was an air-cooled, single-cylinder, four-stroke engine with double overhead camshafts (DOHC). The camshafts were driven by a gear train. The valves were at an angle of 90¬∞ to each other and were closed by hairpin valve springs. The bore and stroke were 72.6 mm √ó 60 mm, giving an engine displacement of 248.2 cc. A Dell'Orto SS 25 A carburetor was used. A Wet multi-plate was driven by gears from the crankshaft. The machine had five speeds. The rear wheel was driven by a chain. The MV Agusta had a double cradle frame that was constructed from chrome molybdenum tubes with a diameter of 25 mm √ó 1.2 mm. The front fork was a telescopic fork, and the rear suspension was swingarm with hydraulic shock absorbers. Results The machine was successful that year's championship: Carlo Ubbiali won five of the six GPs (in the Ulster Grand Prix he set the fastest lap but subsequently retired). Ubbiali was world champion and second in the championship was Luigi Taveri also riding an MV Agusta. MV's dominance in the 250cc class was helped by lack of competition from other factories. Moto Guzzi (third with Enrico Lorenzetti) had already stopped developing the 250 Bialbero in 1955, NSU (fifth with Horst Kassner) had withdrawn its factory team at the end of 1955 after the deaths of Rupert Hollaus and Gustav Baumm, and Kassner rode with an NSU Sportmax production racer. ƒåZ machines were by no means at the level of the Western brands, Franti≈°ek Barto≈° was only twelfth. In 1957 the fortunes for MV Agusta changed. First, Mondial appeared with the 250 Bialbero and two top drivers: Cecil Sandford, who was the 1952 125 cc Champion, and brought experience to the team, and Tarquinio Provini, who was only 23 years old but very talented. The season started well for MV Agusta: Carlo Ubbiali won the first Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring and his teammate Roberto Colombo came in second. In the Lightweight TT, Taveri and Colombo came in second and third behind Sandford, while Provini set the fastest lap. Ubbiali and Provini dropped out.The Motor-Cycle dated 13 June 1957. In Assen the MVs did not start. Provini won convincingly, ahead of Sandford and Sammy Miller. Remarkably, MV Agusta dropped this race, Colombo was there, but only started in the 125cc class, in which he finished second. Roberto Colombo died following an accident during practice for Spa-Francorchamps when he was using the MV Agusta 350 4C. MV withdrew from the 250 cc class for the rest of the season. However, John Hartle, on an experimental twin-cylinder MV Agusta still raced in Spa and won. Roberto Colombo was posthumously the best 250 cc MV driver that season. He finished fourth in the Championship, Ubbiali came fifth. The fall of 1957 proved be a turning point for world road racing championships. All major Italian brands (Mondial, Moto Guzzi, Gilera and MV Agusta) decided to withdraw en bloc from the World Championships. The costs of racing were huge and disproportionate to the sales. For Moto Guzzi and Gilera this was especially so, because their income was solely from motorcycle sales. Mondial was able to make some money with transport tricycles and for Agusta, motorcycle production was still more a hobby than a profession. Count Domenico Agusta reversed his decision and continued the racing activities. In 1958, MV Agusta was the only remaining top racing marque competing, so could engage the top drivers of the time: John Surtees and John Hartle in the 350 and 500 cc classes and Tarquinio Provini and Carlo Ubbiali in the 125 cc and 250 cc classes. Provini won four of the six 250 cc races that season and became a world champion by a huge margin, and MV won the Constructors Championship. The machine was still used in 1959 by privateers, but the factory riders had the new MV Agusta 250 Bicilindrica, on which John Hartle had already won in Belgium in 1957.

The Acclaim Remote Controller is a third party wireless game controller developed by Acclaim Entertainment Inc for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1989. This accessory used standard IR signals, commonly found in other remote controls of the time, to send button inputs from the wireless control pad to a receiver plugged into a controller port on the console.  History and Design  Originally when redesigning the NES for the North American video game market, it was conceived to have all wireless controllers. This idea was abandoned in further redesigns of the console due to poor audience reception of the Advanced Video System. As a result, Nintendo did not release a first party wireless controller for the NES. Years later, Nintendo ended up releasing the NES Satellite. This accessory would connect up to four standard wired controllers to a wireless hub that would transmit button inputs to a receiver plugged into the console. The button layout on the controller is identical to a standard NES control pad. However the controller itself built thicker to fit in 4 AAA batteries. This accessory also has an adjustable turbo switch, to allow a user to hold down a button instead of pressing it multiple times, as well as a power switch, to allow the user to conserve battery life when not in use. This accessory allowed gamers to be up to 30 feet away from the receiver but it required a clear line-of-sight between the controller and the receiver.  Reception  The Acclaim Remote Controller initially sold for $40 when released in the United States. Another wireless controller, called the Quickshot, competed at a much lower price point of $15. Popular Mechanics Magazine noted that other wired controllers from third-party sellers, offered more features. Some noted that the advertising for this controller was too vague and non-descriptive.

He was also a JP and local councillor, becoming an alderman and Mayor of Cardiff. Background Brain was born in Bristol on 4 May 1850, to Samuel Brain, a timber merchant, and his wife, Emma. He married in 1872 to the daughter of Mr J. Thomas, the owner of Cardiff's Old Brewery. Brain's Brewery By 1882, Brain was running the Phoenix Brewery in Working Street, Cardiff. In December 1882 with the help of his uncle Joseph Benjamin Brain, he purchased the long-established Old Brewery, St Mary Street, from his brother- in-law, John G. Thomas. The business went from producing 100 barrels of beer a week for its 11 licensed public houses, to producing 1,000 barrels of beer and owning 80 public houses in 1900. In 1897 the business became a limited company, S. A. Brain & Co. Ltd, which paid ¬£350,000 for the brewery. Samuel Brain became chairman and managing director. Politics and public service Prior to his heavy involvement in business, Brain was a member of the Glamorgan Artillery Volunteers, becoming a sergeant. He later became captain of the No. 7 (Cardiff) Company and ultimately a major in the No. 11 (Barry) Company before his death. Brain was persuaded to stand for elected office in 1885 and became a Conservative councillor on Cardiff Town Council for the Canton ward. After ward boundary changes in 1891, Brain was elected councillor for the Grangetown ward, despite it being a 'Radical' supporting, working class district. As an alderman of the county borough, he chaired the Cardiff County Borough Council finance committee. In November 1899 he was elected Mayor of Cardiff, serving for 12 months. Death Brain died on 19 February 1903 aged 52, at his home on Plymouth Road, Penarth. He had been taken ill in London on 11 February and it was believed he had later suffered a blood clot on the brain. He was buried at St Augustine's Church, Penarth, on the 23 February 1903.

Oberlin College is an Ohio legal case concerning libel, tortious interference and infliction of distress. The case began with an incident of shoplifting by an Oberlin College student at Gibson's Bakery, a local store. Following the arrests of three students related to the shoplifting incident, some students, faculty members and employees of Oberlin College protested against the bakery, alleging racism. The case ultimately involved questions about the responsibilities of universities during student protests. In 2019, a jury found that Oberlin College had defamed the owner of Gibson's Bakery and his family, and awarded them millions of dollars in damages. The school has appealed but the court required them to post a bond while the appeals process continues. Background Gibson's Bakery is a fifth-generation family business, established in Oberlin, Ohio in 1885. Half of the city's 8,000 residents are students (3,000) or employees (1,000) of Oberlin College. Local merchants are reportedly frequent targets of shoplifting by students of the school. The school's newspaper has published an article describing shoplifting as a rite of passage among Oberlin students. According to police records, between 2011 and 2016 there were four robberies at Gibson's Bakery and 40 adults were arrested for shoplifting, 33 of whom were college students. According to Gibson's, the bakery loses thousands of dollars to shoplifters every year. The owner of a nearby Ben Franklin store reported losing more than $10,000 a year to shoplifters. =2016 shoplifting incident= On Wednesday, November 9, 2016, an underage African-American Oberlin College student attempted to purchase a bottle of wine using a fake identification card. The store clerk, Allyn D. Gibson, a son and grandson of the owners, rejected the fake ID. Gibson noticed that the student was concealing two other bottles of wine inside his jacket. According to a police report, Gibson told the student he was contacting the police, and when Gibson pulled out his phone to take a photo of the student, the student slapped it away, striking Gibson's face. The student ran out of the store. Gibson followed and tackled him in the street. Witnesses reported that Gibson put the student in a chokehold, though this is denied by the Oberlin Police Department. Two other students, friends of the shoplifter, joined the scuffle. When the police arrived, they witnessed Gibson lying on the ground with the three students punching and kicking him. Eyewitnesses claimed that the other two students involved in the altercation were restraining Gibson to prevent him from harming the student. The police report stated that Gibson sustained a swollen lip, several cuts, and other minor injuries. The police arrested the students, charging all three with assault and the shoplifter with robbery as well. In August 2017, the three students pleaded guilty, stating that they believed Gibson's actions were justified and were not racially motivated. Their plea deals carried no jail time in exchange for restitution, the public statement and a promise of future good behaviour. =Response= The day after the incident, faculty and hundreds of students gathered in a park across the street from Gibson's Bakery protesting what they saw as racial profiling and excessive use of force by Gibson toward the shoplifter. The Oberlin Student Senate immediately passed a resolution saying that the bakery \\"has a history of racial profiling and discriminatory treatment of students and residents alike,\\" calling for all students to \\"immediately cease all support, financial and otherwise, of Gibson's\\" and called upon Oberlin College President Marvin Krislov to publicly condemn the bakery. For about two months, the college suspended its purchasing agreement with the bakery for the school's dining halls, in what it said was an attempt to de-escalate the protests. Oberlin blamed the bakery for bringing the protests on itself, claiming that \\"Gibson bakery's archaic chase-and-detain policy regarding suspected shoplifters was the catalyst for the protests... The guilt or innocence of the students is irrelevant to both the root cause of the protests and this litigation.\\" During a meeting with Gibson's, Oberlin stated it would consider reinstating the business relationship if the bakery agreed to not bring criminal charges against first-time shoplifters. According to the civil complaint filed by the bakery, Gibson's was worried such a policy would cause an increase in future shoplifting. Oberlin made a proposal to all local businesses that if a business would contact the college instead of the police when students were caught shoplifting, the college would advise the students that if caught shoplifting a second time they would face legal charges. Some observers viewed the Oberlin protests as a reaction to the election of Donald Trump as President. In the opinion of attorney William A. Jacobson, who followed the case closely, \\"On a different campus on a different day, it is unlikely a simple shoplifting case would have gained much attention.\\" In September 2018, Oberlin student Sophie Jones wrote an opinion column in a student publication reminiscing about the 2016 protests, \\"The 2016 presidential election was fresh; the violence at Gibson‚Äôs, to me, felt like another, more personal reminder that white complacency like my own was a delusion, a two way mirror behind which systemic racism operated unhindered...\\" Longtime African-American Oberlin resident Eric Gaines testified, \\"The election occurred the night before... People were anxious and it was like a time bomb ready to explode.\\" In a November 2016 letter to faculty and students, Oberlin College President Marvin Krislov said, \\"This has been a difficult few days for our community, not simply because of the events at Gibson's Bakery, but because of the fears and concerns that many are feeling in response to the outcome of the presidential election.\\" A former administrator said that Oberlin's recent drop in enrollment caused the school to be wary of disagreeing with its students. \\"A freshman from an East Coast big city might come to Oberlin and find there is little for a social justice warrior to do in a small town like this, so they get frustrated and make issues like this shoplifting thing bigger than it should be, and the school follows along.\\" Retired Oberlin professor Roger Copeland was also critical of the protests, writing a year after the protests began, \\"It‚Äôs embarrassing when one has to ask Oberlin students the same question one asks climate-change deniers: At what point do you accept the empirical evidence, even if that means having to embrace an ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù truth? ... The time has come for the Dean of Students Meredith Raimondo, on behalf of the College, to apologize to the Gibson family....\\" Dean Raimondo reacted to Professor Copeland's statement in a private text message, \\"Fuck him. I'd say unleash the students if I wasn't convinced this needs to be put behind us.\\" To Conor Friedersdorf, a writer for The Atlantic known for his civil libertarian perspectives, college administrators at Oberlin \\"calculatingly wield some control over whether students activists are aggressive or restrained.\\" An email from Vice President of Communications Ben Jones read, \\"All these idiots complaining about the college hurting a 'small local business' are conveniently leaving out their massive (relative to the town) conglomerate and price gouging on rents and parking and the predatory behavior toward most other local business. Fuck 'em.\\" Lawsuit and trial In November 2017, Gibson's Bakery filed a civil complaint against Oberlin for libel, slander, interference with business relationships, and interference with contracts in the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas. Gibson's argued the college supported the protests that damaged its reputation and that the college unlawfully broke its contract with the bakery. In the complaint, the Gibson family alleged that some Oberlin College professors attended the demonstrations, joined in the chants with a bullhorn, and gave course credit to students who skipped class to attend the demonstrations. It also claimed Oberlin employees distributed boycott flyers and allowed them to be photocopied for free on school machines. Oberlin's Dean of Students, Meredith Raimondo and other College officials joined the protestors, bringing them pizza, authorizing the purchase of winter gloves for students protesting in cold weather, and helping pass out flyers urging passersby to boycott Gibson's. Jason Hawk, a reporter and editor with the Oberlin News-Tribune testified that Dean Raimondo blocked him repeatedly from photographing the protest, telling him that he did not have a right to photograph the student protestors and handed him a flyer that read \\"This is a RACIST establishment with a LONG ACCOUNT of RACIAL PROFILING and DISCRIMINATION.\\" Local police records showed no previous accusations of racial profiling by Gibson's Bakery. Of the forty adults arrested for shoplifting from the bakery in a five-year period, only six were black. As a part of the three students' guilty plea in August 2017, each read a statement saying, \\"I believe the employees of Gibson‚Äôs actions were not racially motivated. They were merely trying to prevent an underage sale.\\" Reporters obtained an email written by Emily Crawford, an employee for the school's communications department, telling her bosses that she found the protests \\"very disturbing,\\" saying, \\"I have talked to 15 townie friends who are [persons of color] and they're disgusted and embarrassed by the protest. In their view, the kid was breaking the law, period... To them this is not a race issue at all.\\" During the trial, witness Eddie Holoway, a black man who worked his way through technical college while working at Gibson‚Äôs Bakery, said that the racist allegations against his former employer were untrue. \\"In my life, I have been a marginalized person, so I know what it feels like to be called something that you know you‚Äôre not. I could feel his pain. I knew where he was coming from.\\" Clarence 'Trey' James, a black man employed at Gibson's since 2013, testified that he had observed no racist treatment of customers or employees. \\"Never, not even a hint. Zero reason to believe, zero evidence of that.\\" Trey also told the student-run Oberlin Review, \\"When you steal from the store, it doesn't matter what color you are. You can be purple, blue, green; if you steal, you get caught, you get arrested.\\" Despite this claim, a number of black alumni told the Rolling Stone that they felt uncomfortable shopping at Gibson's Bakery. Similar complaints were made in a comment on Gibson's Bakery's yelp page. During the trial, the defense said that the lawsuit was an attempt by the bakery to \\"profit from a divisive and polarizing event...\\" Oberlin argued that purchasing food and gloves for protesters was not an endorsement of the protests. They also argued that the two-month suspension of Gibson's dining hall agreement was an attempt to de-escalate the protests, but Gibson's replied that students interpreted the decision as the school taking the side against the bakery, inflaming the protests instead. Oberlin also tried to argue that any statements that may have been made about the Gibsons being racist or having a history of racial profiling are opinions and cannot be libelous. =Verdict= In June 2019 the jury found in favor of the Gibson family, awarding $11 million in damages. Oberlin released a statement disagreeing with the outcome, asserting they not only did not defame the bakery, but also attempted to repair the damage caused by the protests. \\"Colleges cannot be held liable for the independent actions of their students. Institutions of higher education are obligated to protect freedom of speech on their campuses and respect their students' decision to peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights.\\" Attorney Lee Plakas representing the Gibson family in the trial responded \\"The recent efforts of Oberlin College and President Ambar to reframe this as a First Amendment issue, while undermining the jury's decision, should be incredibly concerning to us all. Oberlin College was never on trial for the free speech of its students. Instead, the jury unanimously determined that Oberlin College libeled the Gibsons.\\" Oberlin College president Carmen Twillie Ambar told CBSN, \\"The jury found those statements in the flyer, and in the Senate Resolution, were statements that they thought were libelous. What we've been saying is we didn't write those statements... The college didn't construct the flyer, the college didn't condone the flyer, it didn't write the Student Senate resolution... There was one administrator there who was representing the institution, and the student handbook requires her to be there... There may have been some professors who were there operating in their own individual capacity, but they weren't representing the institution.\\" In the official statement released by Oberlin, the school also said it regrets \\"that the jury did not agree with the clear evidence our team presented,\\" a response that Legal Insurrection, a conservative law blog, said was \\"baffling because the trial is not over. The jury will hear more evidence and render a verdict on punitive damages... The post-verdict email could be Exhibit A at the punitive damages hearing as to why the compensatory damages are not sufficient to send a message to Oberlin College.\\" The jury later awarded the plaintiffs $33 million in punitive damages, for a total award of $44 million. At the end of the month, Judge John Miraldi reduced the total award to $25 million because state law limits punitive damages. In July 2019, the court ordered Oberlin to pay an additional $6.5 million as reimbursement for Gibson's attorney fees and other legal expenses. =Appeals= On October 8, 2019, the college filed a Notice of Appeal appealing the case to the Ninth District Court of Appeals in Akron, Ohio. Days later, Gibson's Bakery filed their own Notice of Appeal asking for review of Ohio's statutory caps on monetary damages, rulings made by Judge Miraldi on motions, and the exclusion of expert witness testimony in the trial. Oberlin College filed their principal appeals brief June 5, 2020.Jacob, Bob (June 5, 2020). \\"Oberlin College files principal brief appealing Gibson's Bakery judgment.\\" Cleveland Jewish News.

B. Yehoshua, originally published in Hebrew in 1977. The book has been translated into 23 languages, and has been adapted for the screen twice. Written from the point of view of each of the six main characters, the book explores themes of adultery, war, Israeli national identity, and diaspora.  Synopsis  Gabriel Arditi, an Israeli living in France, returns to Israel penniless in order to retrieve his dead grandmother's belongings, only to find out that she, though in a coma, has not yet died. Bringing his grandmother's dilapidated blue 1947 Morris to a nearby garage, he finds himself unable to pay for the repairs. Adam, the garage owner, takes Gabriel back to his home to work as a translator for his wife, Asya, in order to pay off the debt. Soon, Asya and Gabriel begin an affair. At the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War, Adam urges Gabriel to visit the recruitment office in order to avoid arrest, but once registering for service, Gabriel goes missing. Adam begins to obsessively search for Gabriel, consulting army offices and visiting the hospital where Gabriel's grandmother, Veducha, lays comatose. Recruiting Na'im, an Arab boy who works in his garage, the two begin to search for the blue Morris under the guise of running a nighttime towing service. As the novel progresses, Na'im and Adam break into Veducha's apartment, only to find that she had awoken from her coma and returned in the days prior. Promising Veducha that they will locate Gabriel, Adam pays Na'im to be her live-in caretaker and continues his overnight towing operations. Na'im and Adam are soon joined by Adam's daughter, Dafi, and the two children begin a romantic relationship. Losing hope, and with his daughter facing expulsion at school, Adam receives an urgent phone call from Dafi's school principal who has been involved in an accident. Upon arrival to the scene, Adam discovers that the blacked-out car that had collided with him was a repainted blue 1947 Morris, and suspects that the driver was Gabriel. He manages to locate the car in an ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood and finds Gabriel in disguise. Gabriel reveals that, having been sent to war, he was visited by a group of Orthodox Jews who had accidentally left behind a jacket. Growing out his sideburns and beard, Gabriel used the jacket to disguise himself as an Orthodox Jew and returned to civilian life by repainting his grandmother's car, which he had been using for work as a chauffeur for his adopted Haredi community ever since. As Adam and Gabriel reconcile his reappearance, Dafi is expelled from school. Asya brings Gabriel and Adam back to Haifa, and Na'im finds that Veducha is on the brink of death. Fearing that he, as an Arab, will be held responsible for her death, he flees to Dafi's house, and the two make love. Arriving home, Adam kicks Na'im out of the house and takes him to Veducha, where they find her dead. Adam, hesitant of the relationship between Na'im and his daughter, sends Na'im across the border to his home village. Deported and unwelcome, Na'im nonetheless finds himself euphoric and hopeful about his relationship with Dafi.  Characters  Adam - A prosperous but emotionally-detached garage owner. Asya - A teacher completely devoted to her work, the emotionally-divorced wife of Adam and mother to Dafi. Dafi - A 15 year old girl and the daughter of Asya and Adam. Born to her parents after the loss of their first child, Yigal, she is neglected and lonely in her relationships, but overly-rebellious at school. Na'im - A teenage Arab boy and worker in Adam's garage. He finds himself bitter about his lack of education, but is highly intelligent and can recite Bialik poems from memory. Gabriel - A former Israeli-turned-Frenchman, he lacks a livelihood and has drifted aimlessly since being hospitalized for mental health issues. Despising Israel, he reluctantly returns to collect his grandmother's inheritance only to find that she is still alive. Veducha - Gabriel's sickly grandmother. Awaking from her coma, she finds herself needing to cope with her failing health and reconcile her anti-Arab racism with her new housemate, Na'im.

Phares concluded that the album \\"doesn't leave listeners a moment to catch their breath -- or grow bored.\\" In the words of PunkNews, \\"The four women who make up Otoboke Beaver are so unbelievably talented and insane and frenetic that the twenty-seven or so minutes that make up this album grab you immediately and never let you go.\\" Vrinda Jagota of Pitchfork described the album as \\"a tornado of defiance\\" and \\"fueled by a rage so ferocious it's thrilling to behold.\\" Chris Conaton of PopMatters criticized the construction of some of the songs, but concluded that \\"Even when they're angry, these women are clearly having a great time, and that enthusiasm makes for an infectious listening experience.\\"  Track listing  Notes: (‚Ä°) indicates songs previously released on the EPs Bakuro Book (2016) and Love Is Short!!

Dominik  Otago C.V.\\" He is presently Integrated Researcher of Classical Studies and Research Fellow at the University of Lisbon and Professor Emeritus of Classics at the University of Otago.  Life  Dominik is the son of university professors of classical music and spent his childhood in a number of states in the USA. He earned a BA in Classics and English from the University of the Pacific in 1975, after which he left the US to live overseas for what has amounted to all but a few years. He is married to Brazilian artist and former nutritionist Najla Barroso Dominik.  Career  Dominik received his PhD in Classical Studies from Monash University in 1989 after gaining an MA in Classical Humanities from Texas Tech University in 1982. He taught at the University of Natal from 1991 to 2001, where he rose to the rank of Professor and Chair of Classics and Director of the Program in Classics. He moved to the University of Otago as Professor and Chair of Classics in 2002, where he served as Head of the Department of Classics from 2002 to 2009. Dominik was awarded Professor Emeritus status in 2015. An idiosyncratic aspect of Dominik's career has been its wide international dimension. In addition to holding the aforecited posts at the University of Natal and the University of Otago, he has served in recent years as Invited Professor and Integrated Researcher at the University of Lisbon (2018-2019) and CAPES Visiting Foreign Professor at the Federal University of Bahia (2010, 2016‚Äì17). He has also held visiting professorships and other teaching/research positions at Texas Tech University (1981-1982, 1990-1991), Monash University (1985-1988), University of Leeds (1997-1998), University of Cambridge (2000-2001), University of Edinburgh (2006-2007), and the University of Oxford (2013).  Research  Dominik is the author or editor of several hundred publications, including sixteen books, on Latin literature, especially Roman epic of the Flavian period; Roman rhetoric; the classical tradition and reception; lexicography; etymology; and other topics. Dominik's research is significant for its emphasis upon the political, especially critical and dissident, aspects of imperial Roman literature (to which one critic refers as ‚Äúla osad√≠a de Dominik\\"Cecilia Criado, La teolog√≠a de la Tebaida Estaciana (Hildesheim 2000), p. 16.) and its positive hermeneutic approach to the literature and rhetoric of the imperial era. A distinctive feature of Dominik's research and pedagogical output is its collaborative nature, which is evident especially through the publication of various co-edited books and a journal. He was the founding editor and manager of the Classics series Scholia: Studies in Classical Antiquity (1992-2011).\\"William J. Dominik  Scholia: Studies in Classical Antiquity\\" In addition to having served as a referee for over sixscore publishers, journals, and institutions, Dominik has supervised, examined, and moderated over a gross of postgraduate dissertations. Dominik has delivered over sevenscore lectures and papers, including many invited or commemorative presentations such as a University of Cambridge Faculty of Classics Literature Seminar (2000), an Inaugural Professorial Lecture at the University of Otago (2002), the keynote address at the Federal University of Bahia Inaugural Classics Colloquium (2010), the Third Biennial Constantine Leventis Memorial Lecture at the University of Ibadan (2010), a Royal Society of New Zealand National Identity Symposium Presentation (2011), an Oxford Philological Society lecture (2013), and the Inaugural Seminar at the Federal University of Sergipe Postgraduate Program in History (2016).

The film was released on February 12, 1943, by Producers Releasing Corporation. This is the thirteenth movie in the \\"Lone Rider\\" series, and the second starring Robert Livingston. The first eleven movies star George Houston. Plot Tom Cameron, the Lone Rider, discovers that a gang of Nazi spies are interfering with the federal government's plans to round up horses for military service -- and, worse, that his own twin brother is helping them. Continuity The murder of Tom Cameron's family was a major plot point in the first \\"Lone Rider\\" movie, The Lone Rider Rides On. In that movie, the reveal that Tom's brother had survived was the movie's big twist. His brother sacrificed himself heroically at the end of the movie, with no mention that Tom had another surviving twin brother.

The Chaska brick industry flourished from 1857 until 1950. First called \\"Chaska brick\\" in an 1894 Chaska Herald article, this product remains closely tied to the history of the city from which it came. Background Three key factors led to the success and popularity of Chaska brick. First, the brick is made from clay found in deep, rich, alluvial clay deposits, with a distinctive layer of yellow clay over blue. Both clays are rich in sand and finely ground silica, giving the bricks a slight sparkle. Early use of wood to fire the brick versus later gas oven firing also caused sparkling. Early brick makers in the 19th century thought the deposit to be limitless, but it turned out to be about deep. The existence of nearby rich wood sources to heat the brick- making kilns was another reason for the Chaska brick industry's success. Chaska and Carver County are located in what was once the Big Woods of western Wisconsin and south-central Minnesota. This large forest of oak, maple, basswood, elm, ash and white birch provided tons of wood to heat the kilns. Many farmers clearing land traded firewood for brick, and off-season brick workers cut firewood for their employers. Third, Chaska was settled by German and Scandinavian immigrants, who came from areas where brick was the favored building material. These immigrants were skilled brickmasons, and provided experienced labor for the brickyards. Chaska brick also weighed less than other brick, making it cheaper to transport. Brick making and firing techniques improved over time as well. History By the 1860s, four main brickyards existed in Chaska, employing about 100 people overall, in a town of only 1,255 people. By the 1880s, the number of employees had risen to nearly 400. By 1900, daily production reached a prodigious three and a half million bricks. Six brickyards employed around 600 men, 20% of the city population, making Chaska brick the leading source of jobs and money for the town. By the beginning of the 20th century, 30% of all brick used in Minnesota was made in Chaska. Many important buildings in Minnesota are constructed of Chaska brick. For example, in Minneapolis, it can be seen in the Orpheum Theatre, Renaissance Square, International Market Square, Wesbrook Hall on the University of Minnesota Minneapolis Campus, the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, and the Minneapolis Auditorium. In Saint Paul, the Minnesota State Capitol‚Äîwhere over two million bricks built the basement‚Äîand the prison at Fort Snelling are made with Chaska brick. It was used to line the sewers of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Chaska brick was used in many types of buildings, such as schools, city buildings, factories, mills, hotels, barns, houses, outhouses, stables, saloons, restaurants, banks, and churches. Over the first half of the 20th century, the Chaska brick industry stalled. New building materials like structural clay tiles and concrete blocks were preferred. The new types of materials, and the financial crisis of the Great Depression, led to the industry's decline. There was not enough demand for the supply. In the late 1960s, building fashion changed, and olive green or harvest gold bricks were preferred. Overtime, brickyard owner Charles Klein bought out the other brickyards, or they shut down from lack of sales. Trouble between labor and management in the 1960s lowered Chaska brick's market price, interrupting the supply produced. Klein's brickyard, the last to produce Chaska brick, finally shut its doors in 1971. Legacy After production of Chaska brick ended, its historic significance was recognized. Many buildings made of Chaska brick were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Examples of these buildings in Carver County include the Frederick E. DuToit House, the Wendelin Grimm Farmstead, the Herald Block, the Simons Building and Livery Barn, and the Paul Mohrbacher House. In the 21st century, efforts to protect Chaska brick buildings continue through historic preservation.

Subsequent research has supported Strack's claim that participants knowing they are being recorded by cameras led to the replication study's negative result.

He was Bishop of Aliwal from 1987 to 2004. He has advocated the ordination of teams of married men as priests to serve communities that otherwise lack regular access to the sacraments, with their functions designed to distinguish them from celibate priests. Biography Fritz Lobinger was born on 22 January 1929 in Passau He was ordained as a priest in Regensburg on June 29, 1955. As a seminarian in Regensburg in 1953, Lobinger together with and , determined to serve in the foreign missions. He arrived in Aliwal, South Africa, in 1956. Oswald Hirmer followed in 1957 and Hubert Bucher in 1958. All three of them would spend the rest of their lives in South Africa and become bishops. Lobinger launched his extensive writing career in 1963, publishing with Hirmer as co-author Africa‚Äôs Way to Life, a catechism based on their experience of African culture and designed for the instruction of adult candidates for baptism. The two colleagues were also the first missionaries in more than a century to encourage the use of traditional Xhosa musical styles in creating church songs. From 1970 to 1986, Lobinger worked at the Lumko Missiological Institute, the Pastoral Institute of the Episcopal Conference for the implementation of Second Vatican Council in South Africa. Lobinger‚Äôs early interest was in developing a system of \\"trainer catechists\\" to develop lay leadership, recognizing that a catechist plays a far greater role in the local community than his title suggests. He found models of lay engagement in Anglican and Methodist parishes. He visited Brazil several times to study the work of education theorist Paolo Freire. He produced training materials and lead training sessions throughout South Africa. At Lumko, Lobinger contributed significantly to the development of the pastoral model of small Christian communities, including the model of , a method of Bible study that has implications for liturgical ministry, catechesis, social projects, and the institution of the local church. He completed his doctorate in theology in 1986. Speech delivered 15 October 2008, Catholic Theological Faculty, University of Vienna On 18 November 1987, Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of the Diocese of Aliwal. He received his episcopal consecration on 27 February 1987 from Wilfrid Fox Napier, Archbishop of Durban. John Paul accepted his resignation for reasons of age on 29 April 2004. In retirement Lobinger lived with Hubert Bucher and Oswald Hirmer, until their deaths in 2008 and 2011 respectively, in a nursing home for priests in Mariannhill, a suburb of Durban, the headquarters of the Congregation of Mariannhill Missionaries. =Pastoral theory= Working as missionaries, Lobinger and his colleagues at Lumko became advocates of inculturation to promote evangelization in a non-European context. They experimented with and documented ways of engaging parishioners in Church life. Confronted with the shortage of priests, Lobinger has advocated the creation of a new type of Catholic priesthood. He does not advocate the ordination of married men as peers of celibate priests. Instead he argues for the ordination of groups of married men, respected community elders, playing no role outside their local community.. He also believes that the presence of these teams of married elders would enhance the laity's image of the celibate priesthood. Speaking with reporters in January 2019, Pope Francis provided an outline of Lobinger's views as presented in his book Priests for Tomorrow. He called Lobinger's proposals \\"interesting\\" and \\"a matter for discussion among theologians\\", while repeating his own insistence on maintaining celibacy as general practice while considering the ordination of married men to serve linguistic minorities and geographically remote communities. Francis also interpreted Lobinger to mean that the elders would enjoy only one of the three gifts conferred by ordination, leading prayer and celebrating the sacraments, but without the other ministries of teaching and governing. Lobinger objected that this interpretation diminishes the role of the elders in a way he did not intend, but allowed that \\"this is a time of moving into new territory and one must find a way\\". = Writings = * (Dissertation at the University of M√ºnster Faculty of Catholic Theology, 1971) * With Adolf Exeler und Heinrich Aertker:  * With Paul M.

He is the Senior Research Scholar at the Yale Center for British Art and formerly served as Head of Photographs at the National Portrait Gallery, London. Born in Margate, Kent, he currently resides outside of New Haven, Connecticut.  Education  Phillip Prodger received his bachelor's degree at Williams College in 1989 and his master's degree at Stanford University in 1995. In 2000, Prodger received his Ph.D. in history of art from University of Cambridge. He attended secondary school in Hong Kong at Hong Kong International School from 1982-1985.  Career  After a brief tenure as a lecturer at the Hong Kong Arts Centre, Prodger began his museum career at the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for the Visual Arts at Stanford University in 1990. In 2001, he became the Assistant Curator of Prints, Drawings and Photographs at the Saint Louis Art Museum. He became the founding Curator of Photography at the Peabody Essex Museum in 2008 and was named Head of Photographs at the National Portrait Gallery, London in 2014. In 2017, Prodger was given the Rome Award from the Paul Mellon Centre and the British School at Rome. In 2013, he received a Focus Award for contributions to the appreciation and understanding of photography. In 2007, he was named the Lisette Model and Joseph G. Blum Fellow at the National Gallery of Canada.  Research  Prodger's primary area of expertise is in European and American art from the nineteenth century to the present. He has published extensively on topics in the history of photography and art/science interactions. Much of his work centers on the rise of photographic vision and its effect on modern logic systems. Prodger has devoted much research to the so-called ‚Äòsecond invention‚Äô of photography, when wet-plate collodion supplanted Daguerreian and paper negative technologies in the 1850s-70s. During this time, it became possible to record things occurring too rapidly to be seen with the naked eye. This is the central theme of three of Prodger's books‚ÄîTime Stands Still (Oxford, 2003), which analyses the work of Eadweard Muybridge in relation to contemporaneous motion photography; Darwin‚Äôs Camera (Oxford, 2009), which examines Charles Darwin‚Äôs interest in recording facial expressions as they occur; and Victorian Giants (National Portrait Gallery, 2018), which connects the drive for instantaneity in pictures with the rise of art photography in Britain. Prodger coined the term ‚Äòinstantaneous photography movement‚Äô to describe the mania for taking photographs of rapidly occurring action in the mid- to late nineteenth century. Prodger has also written extensively about Modern photography. He is the author of a series, so far including three books (one with Terence Pepper), on Edwardian photographer Emil Otto Hopp√©, produced in collaboration with Graham Howe and the E.O. Hopp√© Estate in Pasadena, California. He is also an author or co-author of books on Ansel Adams, Ernst Haas, and the partnership between Man Ray and Lee Miller. In contemporary art, Prodger has written monographs on William Eggleston, Martin Parr, and Jerry Uelsmann. He has also written short texts for monographs by Anderson & Low, Katharine Cooper, Harold Feinstein, Sharon Harper, Anna Kuperberg, Yann Mingard, Suzanne Opton, Paul Outerbridge, Anne Rearick, and Joni Sternbach. In 2018, he was curator and primary author of an exhibition and catalogue on early Chinese photography produced in association with Tsinghua University and the Loewentheil Collection  Publications  = Books and catalogues = Martin Parr: Only Human, London: Phaidon, 2019.

The species is known from fossil leaves, catkins, and inflorescences found in the early Eocene deposits of northern Washington state, United States, and similar aged formations in British Columbia, Canada. The species is placed as basal in Betula, either as a stem group species, or an early divergent species. History Betula leopoldae fossils have been identified from a number of locations in Western North America, the 49 million year old Klondike Mountain Formation near Republic, Washington along with the Allenby Formation near Princeton, the Falkland fossil site near Falkland, the McAbee Fossil Beds of the Kamloops Group, and the Quilchena fossil site near Quilchena, British Columbia. In general, the geologic ages for the Okanagan Highland locations are of Early Eocene, with the sites that have current uranium-lead or argon‚Äìargon radiometric dates indicating Ypresian ages, while the undated sites or those given older dates being possibly slightly younger and Lutetian in age. Betula leopoldae was described from a series of type specimens collected in the Republic, Washington area during the early 1980s. The paratype leaf, UW 31256 plus the holotype leaf UW 39722, are in the paleobotanical collections of Burke Museum, while the counterpart for the holotype, UCMP 9286 is in the University of California Museum of Paleontology in California. Working from these two specimens, the species was studied by Jack A. Wolfe of the University of California and Wesley C. Wehr of the Burke Museum. They published their 1987 type description in a United States Geological Survey monograph on the North Eastern Washington dicot fossils. The specific epithet leopoldae is a matronym recognizing paleobotanist and conservationist Estella Leopold, though this was not noted in the type description. In a paper which appeared that same year, Peter Crane and Ruth Stockey described a series of B. leopoldae leaves along with catkins, flowering bodies, and pollen from the Allenby Formation. Crane and Stockey noted B. leopoldae to be the oldest reproductive plus vegetative record for a Betula species at that time. A B. leopoldae leaf from the Klondike mountain formation was figured by Conrad Labandeira in 2002 which displayed distinct interior foliage feeding damage from insect feeding, in which a series of four leaf blade sections had been removed between successive secondary veins. Classification Living Betula alleghaniensis, which is similar to B. leopoldae While Wolfe and Wehr did not detail any subgenus placement in the original type description from Republic, the complete nature of the fossil suite in the Allenby Formation allowed for more detailed examination of the relationships. Based on the details from the associated fossils Crane and Stockey placed B. leopoldae within Betula section Eubetula, subsection Costatae, near the living species Betula alleghaniensis. They noted that the last revision of Betula was undertaken by Winkler in 1904 and there were no reasons to conclude subsection Costatae was paraphyletic. Further revision of the genus was done by Forest et al in 2005, who found that subsection Costatae was paraphyletic based on molecular comparisons and the species in the subsection were grouped in the basal nodes of the genus phylogeny. B. leopoldae was interpreted as positioned either in the stem lineage of the genus, or as one of the grade of species which diverged early in Betula diversification. Crane and Stockey noted that the pollen preserved in the flowers is a close match for pollen morphotype Betula claripites that has been reported from the Princeton Basin and Fran√ßois Lake. Description Overall the leaves of B. leopoldae are elliptical to circular in outline ranging up to long, though averaging between . The leaf width is typically but ranges up to . The long petioles narrow from base to leaf blade and meet the blade at a symmetrical to asymmetrical base which may be cordate to obtuse. The margin is serrated with larger primary teeth that are separated by 7 or less smaller subsidiary teeth, all of which have a variable morphology from pointing apically to pointing basally. The teeth are non-glandular and each primary tooth is supplied by a secondary vein and each subsidiary tooth by a secondary vein branchlet. The leaves are pinnately veined with a thin midvein from which the secondary veins alternately or oppositely branch off between 40 ‚Äì 80¬∞. There are between 7 and 13 secondary veins that run parallel to each other and curve upwards near the tips before terminating in the teeth. As the secondaries approach the margin they produce up to 7 branches from the abaxial side, each of which supply subsidiary teeth. The tertiary veins are usually branching near the margin and less so not branching near the midvein. The quaternary veins fully extend between the tertiary veins with both branched and unbranched veins forming polygonal shaped areolae with veinlets terminating in them. The undersides of the leaves, the leaf margins, and the petioles sport numerous long simple hairs. On the smaller leaves the hairs are notably dense in covering. The fruiting heads develop on peduncles. A peduncle bears 25 to 50 trilobed bracts, arranged helically, and each bract is paired with a fruiting head. Fruiting heads are long and wide, with an elliptical profile. Development of the lobes varies notably: central lobes are long while side lobes are . The bases of the slightly woody bracts are cupped where they attach to the peduncle, and the lobe tips are obtuse or rounded. The surface is ribbed irregularly and both upper and lower surfaces have sporadic simple hairs. The fruits are long and have an ovate to elliptical shape with rounded base and pointed tip. The sides are expanded into a narrow flange that is notably thinner than the body of the fruit. At the tip of the fruit are two simple styles. B. leopoldae flowering heads are long and wide and are composed of between 30 and 40 individual flowers. The flowers have a triangular primary bract, elliptical secondary bracts, stamens, and occasional hairs along the margins. The anthers each have two pollen sacs which contain both pollen grains and orbicule grains. The pollen grains each have three circular pores and a scabrate outer surface to the exine. The surface also has spines and granular nodes that are grouped into rows on ridges of the exine.

The line operates every 30 minutes at rush hour and 40 minutes all other times. NH1 trips are roughly 30‚Äì35 minutes. This line provides service to National Harbor and MGM National Harbor from Southern Avenue station. Service to Alexandria, Virginia is provided by the NH2.  Route description  The NH1 operates beginning at 5:45 AM with the last bus leaving at 12:55 AM connecting Southern Avenue station to National Harbor via Southview Apartments and Oxon Hill Parking Lot. The NH1 operates buses out of Shepherd Parkway division alongside the NH2. Prior to 2012, the NH1 would get its buses out of Southern Avenue division.  History  = Introduction of the NH1 = National Harbor opened on April 1, 2008 with the opening of the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center and has since got more attractions like Tanger Outlets and the Capital Wheel through the years. Under the request of Gaylord and National Harbor, WMATA announced new service connecting Southern Avenue station to National Harbor with the new route NH1 beginning on March 23, 2008. The new route will operate 7 days a week between 6 AM and 10 PM every 20 minutes during rush hours and 30 minutes during other times. The state of Maryland pays $312,000 annually for the NH1 operations. In June 2008, Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center have asked Maryland to fund for additional transit service since employees found it difficult to reach National Harbor. = Reroute to Branch Ave = In August 2009 under the request of National Harbor, WMATA rerouted the NH1 to Branch Avenue station travelling along the Capital Beltway. The changes caused controversy among workers as they will now have to travel out further on the Green Line to catch the NH1. Service was also deducted in the morning with buses now arriving past 8:00 AM on the weekends. Gaylord requested for WMATA to restore the original routing back to Southern Avenue station. In response to the changes, Prince George's County created TheBus Route 35 to restore the connection between Southern Ave station and National Harbor. = Route NH3 = In December 2013, WMATA announced a new NH3 route to operate along the former NH1 service between Southern Avenue station and National Harbor during early mornings and late nights with new stops being added of the grand opening of Tanger Outlets Mall. It was also announced that both the NH1 and NH3 will operate via Harborview Avenue instead of National Avenue. = 2015 Service Changes = In 2014, WMATA announced a proposal to restore the NH1 routing to Southern Ave and to discontinue the NH3 completely being replaced by the NH1. Another proposal was to reroute the NH1 along the Woodrow Wilson Bridge to serve King Street‚ÄìOld Town station. This routing would later become route NH2 in 2016.https://alextimes.com/2016/10/nh2-officially-begins-national-harbor- service/ In June 2015, WMATA announced that the NH3 will be discontinued and replaced by the NH1. The NH1 would restore service to Southern Avenue station and will serve Southview Apartments. Service to Branch Avenue station would be discontinued. = 2018 Service Changes = Beginning on September 9, 2018, the St George Blvd & Waterfront St bus stop in National Harbor was discontinued and the NH1 along with the NH2 were rerouted to follow straight on National Harbor Blvd, turn right on Waterfront Street, and make a right turn onto St. George Blvd where it'll serve its current stop at Waterfront St & Potomac Passage. The reason WMATA made the reroute was since of traffic congestion along Downtown National Harbor (Waterfront St) and wanted to offer customers a more efficient trip. However it meant that both the NH1 & NH2 only served one stop at National Harbor.

With this Universal there was confirmed the authority of state power of the Ukrainian Central Council until convocation of the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly. The General Secretariat of the Ukrainian Central Council as its executive office was transformed in Council of People's Ministers of the Ukrainian People's Republic, which was entrusted with the task to continue negotiations with the Central powers as fully independent and conclude a peace treaty. The Universal contained appeals to the government and citizens of Ukraine to combat Bolsheviks and other \\"adversaries\\" who ravage and wreak havoc in the land. There have been declared the complete dissolution of the regular army and creation in its place a people's militia. In economical sphere the task was set to transfer industrial enterprises to a peaceful state, anticipated establishment of state control over banks, the most important branches of trade, export-import, state monopoly on metal, coal and other strategic type of products. It was reported about already developed land law which will convey the land to the labor peasantry without compensation on the grounds of cancellation of private property and socialization before the beginning of the spring field work. By the document it has been also confirmed all public liberties declared in the Third Universal of the Ukrainian Central Council, scheduled re-election to the people's councils, all citizens have been called to treat the elections to the Ukrainian Constituent Assembly with attention.

Early life Osei grew up interested in becoming an actress or dancer but her parents' interest in music exposed her to \\"funk, jazz, hip hop and soul\\" and cultivated an interest in music. At the age of five she received a \\"pink Mickey Mouse drum kit\\" from her uncle: although it was her first exposure to drumming, it would only resonate later, at the age of 11, when a drum club was organized in her school and she felt compelled to permanently take the instrument up. By the age of 12, Osei had started playing in bands. When Osei was 15, she worked at a local music store in Wembley, which she credits with giving her exposure to drummers she \\"looked up to.\\" Musical career Osei was the drummer for The Faders from 2004 through 2006. The band was signed to Polydor and released the singles \\"No Sleep Tonight\\" and \\"Jump,\\" each reaching numbers 13 and 21 in the UK Singles Chart, respectively. The Faders appeared on Veronica Mars and their music was featured on the show's soundtrack. From 2006 through 2012 Osei played drums on Mika's studio work and tours. Her work with Mika led to appearances on Good Morning America, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel Live, South by South West, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Fuji Rock Festival, Glastonbury Festival, and V Festival. During this period, she played drums in the 2008 Beijing Paralympics closing ceremony, performing a commissioned piece by composer Philip Sheppard in the Beijing National Stadium, an event that reached 1.5 billion TV viewers.The Beijing 2008 Paralympics closing ceremony In 2012, Osei began working with Bryan Ferry and Paloma.

In a review of the album ‚ÄúMartin S.‚Äù published on October 24, 2013, the creator of the music portal Tuzin.fm Siarhei Budkin noticed that the band ‚Äúmainly aims at ballads‚Äù and ‚Äúplays intelligent indie-rock‚Äù with a violin. He highlighted the songs ‚ÄúStomlieny,‚Äù ‚ÄúChto ty‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy zrobim usio,‚Äù a rhythmic one, since ‚Äúthese works could be chanted by the progressive part of society throughout the country,‚Äù even though he made critical remarks that the band lacks a clear promise, because ‚Äúsometimes the lyrics appear to be too overloaded as to meaning, sometimes they are too naive, while there is not enough of apt expressions that can be stretched on quotes, though.‚Äù  Albums  * ‚ÄúMartin S.‚Äù (2012) (12 tracks, 40 mins.).

It belongs to the tribe Melectini and to the genus Thyreus, the members of which are often referred to as 'Cuckoo bees', due to their parasitic behaviour. Range The ranges of various bees in the islands of Cape Verde, including T. denolii. Thyreus denolli has been recorded in the islands of Sal, Boa Vista, Santiago, and possibly S√£o Nicolau, in Cape Verde. It is one of four species of Thyreus bees in the area, the other three being Thyreus batelkai, Thyreus schwarzi, and Thyreus aistleitneri.  Etymology  The species was named after the Genoese navigator Ant√≥nio de Noli, who after being exiled from his home country discovered the Cape Verde Islands around 1456 while he was working for Portugal.  Description  The female is approximately 8.1‚Äì10.6mm long, while the male is a little smaller, with a total body length of approximately 7.5‚Äì9.9 mm. The heads of the males are approximately 2.7mm long and 3.5mm wide. The female's head is about 3.2 mm long and 3.9 mm wide. Facial view of T. denoli. Male is on left and female is on right. Like all members of its genus, T. denolli has brightly contrasting coloured patterns on its body. The males can be distinguished from other species of Thyreus in the region by its sixth metasomal tergum (that is, the sixth segment of the posterior part of its body). From the side, the white markings on this segment are usually the same size as those on the fourth and fifth terga. In the female, from the side, the white patches on the fifth tergum are the same size as those on the fourth and third terga. From the front the faces of both sexes very similar to the other members of Thyreus on the island. In the males, the distance between the two eyes is 1.8mm at the top of the eyes and 1.3 at the bottom. In the females, the distance between the eyes is about 1.9mm at the top and 1.3 at the bottom. Both sexes are covered in black or dark brownish-grey pubescence (short hairs) over most of the body. However, parts of the face, legs, and the mesosoma (the middle section of the body) are covered with white, feathery hairs instead.  Breeding and parasitism  The primary hosts of T. denolii and the other three members of Thyreus in Cape Verde are bees in the genus Amegilla. Being a member of Melectini, T. denolii is a kleptoparasitic insect. The females of this tribe lay their eggs in the nest of their host, and their larvae use the resources and stored food provided by the host, at the expense of the host's young.

The EP was produced by lead vocalist and primary songwriter Dustin Payseur. Background and recording Following the release of their eponymous debut album in 2010 to critical acclaim, Beach Fossils continued to tour extensively. According to singer Dustin Payseur, while on tour the band would frequently play extremely high-energy and fast performances. This eventually proved to be physically exhausting, so their forthcoming project would contain much slower tempos. All of the songs on What A Pleasure were written and composed by Dustin Payseur, with contributions from bassist John Pe√±a, as well as Jack Tatum of the band Wild Nothing. Reception What a Pleasure received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Many noted the clear and brighter production as an improvement from their debut album's lo-fi, fuzzy sound. In a positive review, Martin Douglas of Pitchfork noted the contributions from bass player John Pe√±a are evident in the songwriting, comparing it to their eponymous debut album which was written entirely by Dustin Paysuer. Douglas wrote \\"The tunes on What a Pleasure sound like scaled-back variations of themes explored to their fullest potential on the band's debut, which is odd considering how much more collaborative this record is[...] Here, Payseur wrote the songs along with bassist John Pe√±a, and it shows. On certain songs, the bassline provides much of the instrumental melody during the verses, which spreads things out a little, but oses some of Payseur's compositional flair in the process.\\" He concluded his review of the album with \\"It'll be interesting to see where Beach Fossils go from here, because What a Pleasure is the type of release that shows they're talented, but still have a little work to do fully capitalize on it.\\" In a mixed review, The Boston Phoenix wrote \\"This Pleasure is known, but in the end it overstays its welcome.\\" AllMusic was more positive, saying of the EP \\"This collection is a solid batch of homemade melancholy pop, built around Dustin Payseur's mopey vocals, jangling guitars, and athletic basslines, with the occasional surprise like the synth pop gem \\"Out in the Way.\\" It's sure to sound good to anyone who liked Beach Fossils (2010) and wanted more songs in that vein.\\" Track listing * \\"Out In The Way\\" features Jack Tatum of Wild Nothing on vocals, synths, and songwriting. * \\"Face It\\" features uncredited background vocals from Katie Garcia.

The plane struck the ground about 500 feet beyond the end of the runway and came to a stop about a mile from the end of the runway. 35 of the flight's 64 passengers and 4 crew members were taken to area hospitals, mostly for treatment of minor cuts and scratches. It was piloted by Capt. Patrick G. Sweeney, 48, of Wood River, IL. The copilot was John T. Schmeltz, 33, of St. Louis. Ozark airlines began service in Sioux City on August 9, 1955. It was the first crash of a DC9 jetliner for Ozark since the beginning of their use on July 8, 1966. According to the manager of Ozark's News Bureau in St. Louis, Charles R. Ehlert, it was the \\"first crash of any significance for the airline.\\" The US$3 million aircraft () was a total loss. According to the NTSB report: \\"At approximately 0711LT, the aircraft crashed a half-mile north of the airport in a wooded area. There were no fatalities. Among the 64 passengers and four crew members, 11 passengers were hospitalized with minor injuries and three crew members received serious injuries. The aircraft was destroyed in the crash. There was no fire. Flight 982 began its takeoff on Runway 35 with the flight crew aware that ice was present on the wings. The aircraft lifted off and the landing gear was selected to the up position by the first officer. The captain began turning off the landing and taxi lights. As the landing gear began to retract, the aircraft rolled abruptly and violently to the right to an angle of bank estimated by the flight crew to have reached 90¬∞. The captain applied additional power and left rudder in an attempt to level the wings. When no immediate response was noted, he then applied left aileron. With the application of left aileron, the right wing came up; however, the roll continued to the left until the left wing contacted the runway. At this point, the captain discontinued the takeoff. He, approximately 110 feet beyond the departure threshold of Runway 35, succeeded in leveling the wings prior to final ground contact. The aircraft came to rest in a grove of trees approximately 1,181 feet beyond the departure end of Runway 35.\\" According to the NTSB report, the probable cause was: \\"A stall near the upper limits of ground effect, with subsequent loss of control as a result of aerodynamic and weight penalties of airfoil icing. The flight crew failed to have the airfoil ice removed prior to the attempted take-off from Sioux City. The Board also finds that the crew selected an improper takeoff thrust for the existing gross weight condition of the aircraft.\\" It took the Anderson Construction Company 12 hours to salvage and tow the 27.5 ton aircraft to the Air National Guard hangar for further examination by the NTSB.

He was an important leader of the Whig Party in the early years of Wisconsin, serving as party chairman, nominee for United States Congress, for United States Senate, and for Governor of Wisconsin. He also served as a Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge and a member of the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. In historical documents, his middle name is sometimes spelled \\"Linn\\" and he is sometimes referred to as \\"A. L. Collins.\\" Early life and education Alexander L. Collins was born in Whitestown, New York, to Oliver Collins and his fourth wife, Catharine (Kellogg) Collins. His father was a farmer and had been a volunteer in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Oliver Collins rose to the rank of Brigadier General with the New York militia during the War of 1812. Alexander was the tenth of twelve children fathered by Oliver Collins. At the age of 19, he began studying law in the office of Storrs and White, in Whitesboro, New York. In 1833, at age 21, he moved to Cleveland, Ohio, and continued his legal studies. He was admitted to the State Bar in 1835, at the Supreme Court of Ohio. Wisconsin politics Collins practiced law in Cleveland for several years, then moved to the Wisconsin Territory in 1842, settling in Madison. He continued his law practice there, first establishing a brief partnership with Thomas W. Sutherland, who had been the United States Attorney for the Wisconsin Territory. He soon moved into a longer term legal partnership with George Baldwin Smith, and, after 1853, with Elisha W. Keyes, through which Collins became a prominent and well-respected lawyer in the state. Some of his siblings also relocated to Wisconsin--his older sister, Sarah, was the wife of Wisconsin Territorial Governor James Duane Doty. In 1846, Collins was elected to his first public office when he was chosen to represent Dane, Green, and Sauk counties on the Territorial Council. He served on the Council until its dissolution, at the time Wisconsin became a state. In Wisconsin's first election for voting members of Congress, Collins was the Whig Party's candidate in the 2nd Congressional district. He was defeated in that election by Democrat Mason C. Darling. After the seating of the 1st Wisconsin Legislature, Collins stood, along with Edward V. Whiton, as Whig candidates for United States Senate--U.S. senators at the time were elected by the state legislature, rather than through popular election. The Democratic Party had a clear majority in the Legislature, thus Collins and Whiton were defeated by the Democratic Party ticket of Henry Dodge and Isaac P. Walker. Later that year, Collins was appointed to the first Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin. Whiton went on to service on the Wisconsin Circuit Court, and later became the first Chief Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The following year, in 1849, Collins was the Whig Party's nominee in the 2nd Wisconsin gubernatorial election, running against incumbent Governor Nelson Dewey. Collins was defeated and Dewey went onto another term as Governor. Two years later, in 1851, Collins was, again, the Whig nominee for United States Senator, running against incumbent Democrat Henry Dodge. The Democratic Party still held a significant majority in the 1851 legislature, thus re-elected Dodge. In 1852, Collins became Chairman of the Whig Party in Wisconsin, and served as a delegate to the 1852 Whig National Convention, in Baltimore. The 1852 convention would turn out to be the last Whig National Convention. At the convention, Collins was a strong supporter of Daniel Webster, who had been supportive of the Compromise of 1850 and associated with the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. When the convention chose General Winfield Scott as its nominee, Collins left in disgust. As the Whig Party dissolved into the newly forming Republican Party, Collins became briefly associated with the Democratic Party. In 1855, with support of the Democratic Party, he was elected Circuit Court Judge for the newly created 9th Circuit. He had to resign a few years later, in the Fall of 1858, due to health problems. Later years After leaving the court, he went into the land business with his brother-in-law, former Territorial Governor James D. Doty, in Menasha, Wisconsin. At the start of the American Civil War, their business faltered, and in 1864, Collins traveled to California for health and recreation. He returned to Wisconsin in 1867, and, in 1874, resumed his law practice in Appleton, Wisconsin. Death In his later years, Judge Collins resided with his son, Alexander, Jr., in Neenah, Wisconsin, and his daughter, Mrs. Jessie McCord, in Milwaukee. He died in Neenah on October 31, 1901.

The concept arose from Argentinian political scientist Guillermo O'Donnell, who notes that representative democracy as it exists is usually linked solely to highly developed capitalist countries. However, newly installed democracies do not seem to be on a path of becoming fully representative democracies. O'Donnell calls the former delegative democracies, for they are not fully consolidated democracies but may be enduring. For a representative democracy to exist, there must be an important interaction effect. The successful cases have featured a decisive coalition of broadly supported political leaders who take great care in creating and strengthening democratic political institutions. By contrast, the delegative form is partially democratic, for the president has a free rein to act and justify his or her acts in the name of the people. The president can ‚Äúgovern as he sees fit‚Äù even if it does not resemble what he/she promised while running for election. He/she claims to represent the whole nation rather than just a political party, embodying even the Congress and the Judiciary. O'Donnell's notion of delegative democracy has been criticized as being misleading, because he renders the delegative model that is core to many current democratic governments worldwide into a negative concept.  Comparing and understanding delegative democracy  Delegative Democracy has found its way to some of the largest countries in the world and some of these being post-communist. These countries include Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, the Philippines, and Korea. When looking at these countries and others, it is evident that delegative democracies are not institutionalized as they are the midpoint between authoritarianism and representative democracy. When looking at authoritarianism, authoritarianism is a type of government that focuses on strong centralized powers, leaving the population to having limited political freedoms. Authoritarianism is seen as having four main qualities of limited political pluralism, political legitimacy based on lawmakers and politicians appealing to emotion, minimal mobilization within the political sphere and the suppression of anti-regime activities, and finally loosely defined executive powers that can lead to dictatorships at times. Representative democracy, on the other hand, is a type of government that is founded on democracy, based on elected officials that represent the governing body. Within a representative democracy, the power for the representatives is backed by a constitution or other factors to balance the representative power, such as independent judiciaries, deliberative democracy, and a bicameral legislature. Delegative democracies are also described as defective democracies. Delegative democracies are democracies that have some sort of \\"defect\\" to them, hence the name. The characteristics of a delegative democracy are that it undermines the idea of separation of powers (checks and balances). This is due to the fact that in the delegative democracy, the Executive branch holds dominant power, as the legislative and judicial branches of government (mainly the legislative) do not hold the ability to \\"check and balance\\" the Executive branch.  Delegative democracy due to cycles  Delegative democracies are able to prosper in their respective areas due to the fact that there is a specific social and economic crisis that allows those in charge to go about the exercise of their authority. When looking at the history of delegative democracies, it is seen that they are typically set into place after an authoritarian ruling. The timing after this ruling and establishment of a democratic-based government is known as the ‚Äúsecond transition‚Äù. This is moving from a democratically elected government to a democratic regime, also known as an institutionalized democracy. During this ‚Äúsecond transition‚Äù, new democracies can become authoritarian ruling once again. The main element for determining what occurs during the second transition is the governmental policies and the political strategy. When the people see the success of these institutions that specifically support social and economic problems, delegative democracy prevails. This is what occurs in Spain. The overall idea of delegative democracy as a whole is spun from Robert Dahl's definition of polyarchy. When an individual is elected within a delegative democracy, they are able to govern the country as they see fit. Some of these individuals include Indira Gandhi, Corazon Aquino, and Isable Peron). The President is representative of the nation and their actions are said to represent the needs of the whole nation. Their actions are not party- affiliated and in fact, puts themselves above all parties. Unlike democratic republics like the United States who has Congress and the Judiciary, accountability is put all on the President instead of other institutions. Although delegative democracy focuses power on one leader, it shares democratic traditions in terms of allowing the majority to win.  Problems  Although some delegative democracies have been successful, there have been failures due to falling into a pervasive cycle of unhappiness from those that are being governed. Although the large social and economic problems are what allows these Presidents to set their position for their team, it is what also allows them to receive a discount from the population. Delegative democracy is all about the second phase of the democratic cycle so when this cycle is hindered by no economic and social growth, there tends to be unfavorable ruling for the political leader. According to Guillermo O‚ÄôDonnell, ‚Äúvoters are supposed to choose, irrespective of their identities and affiliations, the individual who is most fit to take responsibility of the country‚Ä¶ after the election, voters or delegators are expected to become passive, but cheering audience of what the president does\\". In this sense, voters and the population have their main say in government while they are voting, but once the President is elected, the system reduces their power in terms of freedom of expression.  Case studies  = Colombia = During his period of reign from 2002 to 2010, Colombia president Alvaro Uribe focused all of his power in the executive branch to shift his country towards a delegative democracy. As seen in the examples above, there are times when a delegative democracy can lead to the weakening of institutions, proving to be an endless cycle of political turmoil. Colombia represents an interesting case of overall changes after a delegative democracy is institutionalized through leaders such as Juan Manuel. When looking at Colombia from 2002 to 2010, they were exhibiting a lack of checks and balances due to horizontal accountability where the governmental agencies serve the checks and balances. Various government agencies were not progressive towards people's needs. During Uribe's presidency, his first project was staging a national referendum that focused on establishing a unicameral congress. On top of that, Uribe and his inner group attempted to minimize those that were against this ruling. Credible members of political organizations were removed due to the questioning of his administration. These attacks on key institutions within Colombia represented a large issue in Uribe's governing style in the undermining of the institutionalization of democracy. Uribe and his policies became known as ‚Äúuribismo‚Äù. ‚ÄúUribismo‚Äù is what deteriorated the country's capacity for accountability between governmental offices. Uribismo ideas were mainly backed by the ‚ÄúU‚Äù Parry and the Radical Change Party. Evident in all of these issues that Uribismo caused, delegative democracy leaders have a lack of qualifications but due to the viewpoints of the people, it justifies their authoritarian behavior. = Argentina = President Fernandez on his Election Day. Christopher Larkins argues that due to the impact of the 1980's crisis, delegative democracy (in the sense of O'Donnell) originated in Argentina. The economic crisis was used to justify a centralization of executive authority which began with Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n's administration and continued with Carlos Saul Menem ascending to the presidency. Larkin's arguments exemplify political outtakes on delegative democracy. One of the largest examples of a Delegative democracy in Argentina. Argentina has seen large success in its delegative democracy due to the vertical accountability that is in place. Vertical accountability is when civilians can enforce the performance of those that are in charge. Horizontal accountability, on the other hand, is when only the government is able to hold itself accountable, leading to check abuses by public agencies. When looking at what transpired in Argentina specifically, the death of Alberto Nisman under the rule of President Fernandez led to the foundation of delegative democracy. Fernandez was able to dissolve the Secretariat of Intelligence and replace it with his new Federal Intelligence Agency. This ruling became a foundation for delegative democracy. Fernandez also released the Central Bank Chief, Martin Redrado, after he failed to comply with the orders that she instilled. = Institutional Revolutionary Party = Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) logo. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Institucional, PRI) in Mexico is an example of a party that led to a rise of delegative democracy within a country. The PRI came into power in 1929 with the help of Plutarco El√≠as Calles, a Mexican general and politician. Prior to the rise of the PRI, the country was plagued with political conflict and turmoil due to the assassination of President-elect √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n in 1928. One of the renowned symbols of the PRI is the dedazo (termed from the word dedo - finger).This symbolized the idea that the current president would pass down the title to whoever they \\"pointed the finger\\" to. This process alone shows why delegative democracy takes away the ideas of separation of powers as the democratic process in the people electing their officials is removed. In addition, instead of being checked and balanced by other branches, the president had a select group of cabinet advisers that consisted of at least three individuals extremely close to the president. In 1988, the PRI slowly began to dissolve after multiple progression and the breaking out of the parties \\"Democratic Current\\" with Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas (former Governor of Michoac√°n and son of the former president of Mexico L√°zaro C√°rdenas).  Russian Federation  Russia's electoral law stipulates that half of all parliamentarians will come from voting on party lists, it aims to encourage the formation of political parties. In order to look for political partners and confront skeptical voters, parties must focus on introducing legislation, public opinion campaigns and political education. The parliamentarians, democratically elected, use their democratic legitimacy to justify authoritarian behavior.

Early life Ambrose Martin was born in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1901 to an Irish-Argentinian family from County Westmeath. Martin was raised in the small town of Suipacha alongside many other Argentinians of Irish descent. It was probably also during this time that he became acquainted with the many Basque-Argentinians who lived in Suipacha as well, as he would go on to become deeply involved in the Basque nationalist movement both in Spain and Latin America later in his life. In 1914, he was sent off to Mullingar, Ireland to attend St. Finian's College, where he would spend the remainder of his childhood.McCreanor, Kyle. \\"Ireland and the Basque Country: Nationalisms in Contact, 1895-1939\\", MA Thesis, Concordia University, 2019. pp. 32-33. https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/985162/ Early involvement in politics Following the 1916 Easter Rising, the young Ambrose Martin was swept up in the revolutionary fervour and became involved in Sinn F√©in. Martin rose within the ranks of the movement, coming to be known as a vibrant orator, and befriending notable figures such as Laurence Ginnell, Eamon Bulfin, and Margaret Mary Pearse. He was arrested by the British authorities in 1919 and deported back to Argentina. In Argentina, Ambrose Martin busily worked with Irish republicans to propagandize and raise funds for the movement back in Ireland. He even attempted to organize an IRA brigade in Argentina. After two years, Martin began to journey back to Ireland in 1922 after the pronouncement of the Anglo-Irish Treaty brought an end to the Irish War of Independence. On his way to Ireland, he made a stop in the Basque Country, where he was scheduled to give a series of lectures on Ireland to the youth group of the Basque Nationalist Party. Martin claimed to have 'old friends' from the area, likely going back to his early years in rural Buenos Aires. He made a great impression on the young Basque nationalists, whose press organ reported that \\"never before have we seen our patriotic youth as impassioned\\".\\"Conferencias patrioticas.\\" Aberri no. 63, 7 April 1922. Martin also gave an inaugural speech on Cumann na mBan for the Basque nationalist women's group Emakume Abertzale Batza (\\"Association of Patriot Women\\"). During this visit, he became good friends with Eli Gallastegi and other figures in the separatist Aberri faction of the Basque Nationalist Party. Martin returned to Ireland in April 1922, shortly before the outbreak of the Irish Civil War. In the ensuing conflict between the IRA and the Irish Free State, Martin fought with the IRA against the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Captured by Free State forces and imprisoned at Athlone, he sought to leave Ireland at the end of the civil war, as did many other defeated anti-Treaty republicans. In 1924, he returned to the Basque Country, where he was taken in by his newfound allies. In late 1924 he was arrested by Spanish police alongside some Basque nationalists during a mendigoxale (mountaineering) outing.Vibrant (1933). Res de nou al Pirineu. Barcelona, Nosaltres Sols!, pp. 38, 71. During the military dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923-1930), Basque nationalism was heavily persecuted, and Martin was obliged to leave. Ambrose Martin in the Basque mountains circa 1924 Anti-Treaty political leader √âamon de Valera arranged for Ambrose Martin to stay with Catalan nationalists exiled in Paris. During this time, he became friends with Francesc Maci√†, leader of the Catalan separatist party Estat Catal√† with whom he was lodged.Carner-Ribalta, Josep (1972). De Balaguer a Nova-York passant per Moscou i Prats de Moll√≥ (Mem√≤ries) Paris: Edicions catalanes de Par√≠s. pp. 53-54. He also came into contact with Leopold Kerney, Ireland's pioneering diplomat in France at the time. As his Catalan associates in Estat Catal√† planned a military operation to , Ambrose Martin supplied them with Irish republican propaganda and lessons in IRA tactics.Soler Paricio, Pere (2013). \\"IRLANDA Y LA GUERRA CIVIL ESPA√ëOLA. NUEVAS PERSPECTIVAS DE ESTUDIO\\". PhD disseration, Universitat de Barcelona. pp. 54‚Äî55. http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/43983/1/PSP_TESIS.pdf. This plan ultimately fell through, and Martin returned to Argentina in 1927. Return to Ireland Exiled in Argentina again, Ambrose Martin returned to Suipacha where he opened a business called the \\"Basque-Irish Caf√©\\" catering to the local Basque and Irish diasporas. In 1932, √âamon de Valera's Fianna F√°il party won the Irish election. With many old anti-Treatyites rehabilitated, Martin made his way back to Ireland after approximately eight years in exile. He again stopped first in the Basque Country where he gave another series of lectures which were received with much enthusiasm. Upon returning to Ireland, Martin received lucrative business licenses from the new government to open an import-export business. Amidst the early stages of the Anglo-Irish Trade War, Martin was well-positioned to make a fortune as he tapped new markets for Irish products. Martin established the Irish-Iberian Trading Company in Dublin, and his Basque partners set up a parallel import-export business in Bilbao called Euzkerin with which they cooperatively coordinated Basque-Irish trade. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Martin thrust himself into politics again. In January 1937, Martin assisted the Republican Congress when they brought over Basque priest Ram√≥n Laborda for a publicity tour to raise support for the Second Spanish Republic in Ireland. For his sympathies with the republican government in Spain, Martin was denounced by TD Patrick Belton as \\"one of the most pronounced and prominent Communists in this country.\\" Martin was a strong advocate for the Basque nationalists during the war, and relayed messages from the Basque government to the press in Ireland. Following the fall of pro-republican Basque territory to the rebel armies of Francisco Franco, Basque nationalist icon Eli Gallastegi moved his family to Ireland thanks to the efforts of his close friend Ambrose Martin.Reddin, Stewart (2017). \\"'Irish citizens of Basque origin': The story of Ireland‚Äôs Basque refugees.\\" Gernika Then and Now: 80 years of Basque-Irish anti-fascist struggles. Dublin: Gernika 80 Committee. Later life Following a serious injury from being hit by a car, Ambrose Martin retired to a ch√¢teau he purchased in Brittany, France in 1938. Martin remained there for several years, from where he continued to run the Irish-Iberian Trading Company, now trading with Francoist Spain. He offered temporary shelter in his Breton manor to Basque nationalists fleeing Spain throughout the Second World War.Le Boulanger, Isabelle (2016). L'Exil espagnol en Bretagne (1937-1940).

He was also known as a calligrapher.  Life and work  When he was still a child, his family moved to Nagano Prefecture to escape the difficulties created by the Meiji Restoration. After showing an aptitude for art, he received lessons in nanga and European-style painting. He returned to Tokyo in 1887 to take lessons from Koyama Sh≈çtar≈ç at a school operated by the \\"Association of the Eleventh\\" (ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÊ¨°‰ºö) then, later, at Koyama's own school; \\"Fud≈ç-sha\\" (‰∏çÂêåÁ§æ; roughly, Diversity). In 1894, he met the poet, Masaoka Shiki, who also worked as a journalist, and obtained a position doing illustrations for Small Japanism, an Anti-colonialist newspaper. It was at this time that he began using the name \\"Fusetsu\\" (infallible). In 1895, he went to China in the company of Masaoka, who was then working as a war correspondent. There, he painted scenes from the First Sino-Japanese War and developed an interest in calligraphy. Later, he worked for both the Nippon Shimbun and the Asahi Shimbun. In 1900, he submitted paintings to the Exposition Universelle in Paris and received a small prize. Shortly after, he went to France to study with Rapha√´l Collin; then with Jean-Paul Laurens, who had been one of Koyama's instructors when he was there. Upon returning to Japan in 1905, he became a member of \\", a group devoted to the promotion of Western-style painting. His first showing included a portrayal of the Imperial Family's ancestor goddess, Amaterasu, and her seven protectors, which drew the ire of Kuki Ry≈´ichi, the Minister of Education, because they were portrayed in the nude. The painting was later destroyed in the Great Kant≈ç Earthquake. He sat on the jury for several showings, including the first and the first . In 1919, he was elected a member of the Japan Art Academy. He also did book illustrations; notably for I am a Cat by Natsume S≈çseki (1906), and the Blue Cliff Record. He was not only a calligrapher himself, but spent his life collecting examples of Classical calligraphy; both Japanese and Chinese. In 1936, he used his collection to establish a calligraphy museum in Tokyo. It was maintained by the Nakamura family until 1995, when it was donated to Tait≈ç, a Special Ward of Tokyo.

It is the \\"largest gathering of samurai\\" in the world.  Background  Takeda Shingen's 24 generals , of Kai Province, was a pre- eminent daimy≈ç in feudal Japan with exceptional military prestige in the late stage of the Sengoku period. Shingen was the feudal lord of present-day K≈çfu. Shingen was admired by his followers and rivals. He had a legendary rivalry with Uesugi Kenshin and they fought a series of five battles during the Battles of Kawanakajima. Shingen died of a disease during his pursuit to conquer all of Japan. 24 retainers (generals) served under Shingen. They are noted for their exceptional contributions to Shingen and the Takeda family. They are a popular topic for ukiyo-e and bunraku.Internet Movie Database (IMDb), \\"Shingen Takeda (Character) from Kagemusha (1980); retrieved 2013-5-17.  Description  This is a three day festival that starts on the first or second weekend of April. Takeda's death anniversary is on April 12. There's a reenactment of Takeda Shingen's Koshu Battalion Deployment. People dress in traditional and samurai costumes of the Sengoku Period. An actor plays Takeda Shingen and he is surrounded by his Twenty-Four Generals. After the Shingen-ko Tea Ceremony, Takeda leads his army through the streets of K≈çfu. They march from the plaza in front of Kosu station through the streets of K≈çfu to Maizuru Castle Park which contains the ruins of K≈çfu Castle. On the third day they reach the . A Shinto ritual is held on the anniversary of Takeda Shingen's death. There are multiple parades going to and from these locations. These parades are very theatrical involving serious reenactments who practice the rest of the year for this one weekend in April. The parades reflect the different comings and goings of Takeda Shingen during his life. This is one of the largest historical reenactments in Japan. In 2012 the festival was included in the Guinness World Records as the \\"largest gathering of samurai\\" in the world with 1061 participants. The role of daimyo Takeda Shingen is usually played by a Japanese celebrity. The 24 generals have extra detailed armor. Seeing so many people in traditional costumes and more than 1000 samurai gives an impression of what the Sengoku Period was like (1467 ‚Äì 1600 CE). What's special is that anyone can join after a short application. Exchange students of the University of Yamanashi are usually the guard samurai group of the princess. The princess can also be represented by exchange students from Asian countries. So the festival is not fully historically accurate. Each festival has more than 100,000 visitors from all over Japan and international tourists. In 2013 there were 130,000 visitors during the 3 days of the festival. Daimyo Takeda Shingen was played by the actor Ken Matsudaira. Part of the proceeds went to support the area affected by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.  Events  Each day has different kinds of events such as: * Shingen-ko Tea Ceremony * Ritual Prayer * Street stalls with Yamanashi local products, food and drink stands * Koihige Beard Style Contest * Koihime Beauty Contest * Sengoku Period Food Sampling * \\"Fu-Rin-Ka-Zan\\" Dance Parade with 1000 performers * Koshu Battalion Deployment * Child Samurai Parade * Takeda Period Parade * Kendo Tournament * Japanese Drum Taiko Performance * Kofu Hayashi Performance - A Japanese traditional \\"Noh\\" performance in celebrating the battle victory * Educational Lectures  Gallery  File:Shingen-ko_Festival_201904b.jpgThe army corps in front of Maizuru Castle Park (2019) File:Shingen-ko_Festival_201904c1.jpgTakeda Jiro Shin Shintai Corps with students of University of Yamanashi (2019) File:Shingen-ko_Festival_201904c2.jpgMrs. Oi procession (2019) File:Shinji_Yamashita_201904a.jpgActor plays Takeda Shingen (2019) File:Shingen-ko_Festival_201904h.jpgShingen Gourmet Yokocho (2019) File:Paradeimregen2.JPGOnna-Bushi (Female Warriors) with Naginata (pole weapons) File:Paradeimregen5.JPGTakeda Shingen File:Paradeimregen3.JPGJapan had more handguns than the rest of the world in the Sengoku Period File:Wappen der 24 Gener√§le.JPGThe coats of arms of the generals who appear.

The clade is ranked as an infraseries within the subseries Ovalentaria, which in turn is ranked within the wider Percomorpha clade. Characteristics The species within the infraseries Atherinomorpha are generally small fishes which normall grow no longer than , although some needlefishes from the order Beloniformes can grow as long as . The testes of the males are of the restricted spermatogonial type, in which the testes change to reflect a seasonal pattern of reproduction. The females lay demersal eggs with filaments on the chorion. They may or may not have spines in their fins but where these are present they are generally weak. The number of vertebrae is normally less than 24. The pelvic fins are positioned abdominally, subabdominally, or thoracically and may be connected to the pleural rib by a ligament. Ctenoid scales may be present but this is rare within this grouping. The majority of the species within the Atherinomorpha are surface feeding fishes, and about three quarters of the species are restricted to fresh or brackish waters. Within this infraseries adaptation to internal fertilisation has been independently evolved, especially in freshwater groupings, and this taxon contains a greater diversity of internal fertilization than any other group of fishes. Species may be oviparous or viviparous. The filaments on the chorion are used to stick to the substrate and in most taxa, other than the exocoetoids there is an obvious droplet of oil that forms at the vegetal pole. guppies Poecilia reticulata members of the Cyprinodontiformes Taxonomy There is very strong evidence that the Atherinomorpha forms a monophyletic grouping, supported by the emphasis of diverse and unusual reproductive adaptations and this has subsequently been supported by molecular studies. Within the group the Atheriniformes are a sister group to the Beloniformes and the Cyprinodontiformes, with the atherinids which have spines in their fins being regarded as the most basal members of the clade. The fossil range of the Atherinomorpha is the Eocene to the present. The Atherinomorpha is classified as follows: * Infraseries Atherinomorpha ** Order Atheriniformes *** Suborder Atherinopsoidei *** Suborder Atherinoidei ** Order Beloniformes *** Suborder Adrianichthyoidei *** Suborder Exocoetoidei ** Order Cyprinodontiformes *** Suborder Aplocheiloidei *** Suborder Cyprodontoidei References Category:Ovalentaria ","title":"Atherinomorpha"},{"id":"61069405","text":"Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation () is a governmental agency created in 1945 in Poland.

The Commission has undergone a number of name changes: * From 1945 to 1949 it was known as the Chief Commission for Investigation of German Crimes in Poland (G≈Ç√≥wna Komisja Badania Zbrodni Niemieckich w Polsce). * From 1949 to 1984 it was known as the Chief Commission for Investigation of Hitlerite Crimes in Poland (G≈Ç√≥wna Komisja Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich w Polsce). * In the period from 1984 to 1991 it was known as the Chief Commission for Investigation of Hitlerite Crimes in Poland ‚Äì Institute of National Remembrance (G≈Ç√≥wna Komisja Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich w Polsce ‚Äì Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej). * In the period from 1991 to 1999 it was known as the Chief Commission for Investigation of Crimes against the Polish Nation ‚Äì Institute of National Remembrance (G≈Ç√≥wna Komisja Badania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu ‚Äì Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej). In 1999 the commission was merged into the Institute of National Remembrance, becoming the main organizational unit of its investigative department, and its name became the Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation. There are also differences in unofficial translations of the commission name in various sources, with the word Main used instead of Chief, Research(ing) or Examination instead of Investigation, Nazi instead of Hitlerite, and Atrocities instead of Crimes; ex.\\"Main Commission for Researching Crimes against the Polish nation\\".  Activities  Upon its creation, it was tasked with the following: * investigate crimes committed by Nazi Germany in the years 1939‚Äì1945 on Polish territories in general and on Polish citizens in other territories occupied by Nazi Germany and in Germany itself * collect and archive materials about said crimes and * analyze said materials and publish analysis on this topic. This last aspect of its mission has been described as educational. Polish criminal code also stated that investigations of the commission have equal status to court proceedings. The commission has been instrumental in providing evidence for the war criminal trials carried out in Poland by the Supreme National Tribunal (1945‚Äì1948), including for the trials of Albert Forster, Rudolf H√∂ss and Amon G√∂th. By 1950 the Commission had succeeded in getting approximately 2,000 German war criminals extradited to Poland. Its materials were used in later trials of Ludwig Hahn, Erich Koch and , among others. In 1968 its experts and materials were used to aid the United Nations in drafting of the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity. It has also fathered the most comprehensive collection of materials about World War II atrocities in Poland in existence. By 1989 nearly 20,000 Germans were sentenced in Poland for war crimes.

He served as the Prosecutor-General of Sweden from 1966 to 1978 and as the National Police Commissioner from 1978 to 1987. Career Romander was born on 6 March 1921 in Boden, Sweden, the son of lieutenant colonel Nils Romander and his wife Ester (n√©e Steinbeck). He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Stockholm in 1943 and a Candidate of Law degree in 1946. Romander became a public prosecutor in G√∂ta Court of Appeal in 1949 and served as notary and secretary of the 1st Standing Committee on Laws (Lagutskottet) from 1952 to 1955. He had legislative assignments at the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs in 1956, and from 1958 to 1960. He became assessor in 1958 and hovr√§ttsr√•d in 1961. He served as director of the Swedish Prison Board and acting director general from 1960 to 1964. Romander became head of a legal (law-drafting) division at the Ministry of Justice in 1964 and director general for legal affairs there in 1965. In 1966, Romander was appointed Prosecutor-General of Sweden. He held that position until 1978 when he was appointed National Police Commissioner. During 1983-1984, Romander was personally involved in the investigation of Sweden's greatest blackmail cases, Operation Cobra. In February 1986, the Prime Minister Olof Palme was assassinated, Romander was about to retire, but was asked by the Swedish government to continue working and then came to be the highest police chief during the investigation's first two years. During a turbulent time, when the chief investigator Hans Holm√©r was fired, Romander was also commissioned by the government to take over the investigation together with the Prosecutor General. The government, through Minister for Justice Sten Wickbom, ordered Romander, despite the failure of the PKK lead, to continue the investigation against the Kurdish organization - with 300 police officers. He left the position of National Police Commissioner in 1987 and was succeeded by Nils Erik √Öhmansson. Romander was then chairman of the Swedish Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (Brottsskaden√§mnden) from 1988 to 1995. Personal life In 1955, he married Birgitta Sandelin (born 1929), the daughter of lieutenant colonel Melcher Sandelin and Edith Johnsson. They had one daughter, Viveka (born 1958).

He is a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland and sits with the Liberal Party in federal parliament.  Early life  Gerard was born and raised on a property outside Chinchilla, on the Darling Downs. In his youth he worked as a farmhand, fruit picker, bartender and pump attendant. He completed his education in Toowoomba at Downlands College, before moving to Brisbane where he completed a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the University of Queensland. He also has a master's degree in Taxation Law from the University of Sydney and a master's degree in applied finance from FINSIA. He is married with three children.  Political career  The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Rennick donated $35,000 to the Liberal National Party of Queensland in the year before winning the third slot on the party's senate ticket‚Äîa position that eventually saw him elected to a six-year term. The LNP rejected as \\"offensive and ridiculous\\" any suggestion the donations played a role in his preselection, and highlighted the fact that some of their members self funded their elections. Following his election The Guardian noted the similarities between Rennick and One Nation, and humorously suggested it was only a matter of time before Rennick moved to join them. During a speech on the Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct Bill, he referred to Queensland Labor Senator Murray Watt as Labor's \\"chief yapping poodle.\\" On an interview on Sky News, Rennick spoke about government overreach in the \\"classroom and the bedroom\\" and compared it to a Communist takeover by the bureaucracy. When asked to clarify, Rennick said \\"there are... groups within Australia, they are not Chinese groups, they are Australian groups, that seek to undermine our individual liberties and I think that is a greater threat to our sovereignty [than the Chinese government].\\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6162561965001 Prior to the 2020 Queensland state election it was revealed that Rennick donated to an anti-abortion group who were conducting a high profile campaign that was called \\"misinformation\\" and \\"blatant lies\\".  Positions  =Tax Reform= Rennick has used his background in finance to advocate for tax reform. He called for profits in Australia to be taxed at the same rate as profits of foreign owned entities. He claims that this will fund cuts to both payroll tax (even though this is a state based tax) and income tax. =Climate= Rennick has been viewed as a \\"right wing climate denialist\\" by the ALP, and was singled out by ALP leader Anthony Albanese as someone \\"who thinks the Bureau of Meteorology is part of global conspiracy\\".. The view that Rennick does not accept the established scientific findings is widespread in the community. Groups that have expressed this opinion include the Greens, the media and some within the scientific community.. He has repeatedly accused the Australian government's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) of falsifying climate data, and tampering with climate data to \\"perpetuate global warming hysteria\\". On 12 November 2019 Rennick again accused BOM of not following proper processes when recording statistical data, although he admitted he had not yet met with the BOM, adding would \\"get to that eventually\\". Rennick stated that he had read the 2011 independent peer review panel findings into the BOM's methods but nonetheless he accused the BOM of incompetence due to the BOM's supposed failure, in his eyes, to meet the recommendations of the review, even though the key finding of the review was that the methodologies used by the Bureau were satisfactory. Rennick, who is not a scientist, continued to accuse the BOM of not following proper procedures because, inter alia, Australian weather stations do not yet have 3 temperature gauges, as is now best practice in the USA and Canada. This was not a recommendation of the independent review panel, which only recommended that equipment \\"redundancy\\" be deployed in weather stations over time, to which the BOM agreed, stating that \\"System redundancy will be introduced gradually over a ten-year period at a rate that is dependent on available funding.\\" Rennick has also accused the BOM of \\"keeping two sets of books\\", comparing scientific data collection to financial records and accountancy. Rennick has questioned scientists in the media and at Senate estimates on scientific theory and records, including charges that scientists have destroyed records. During that questioning Rennick accused the Bureau of ignoring scientific advice and destroying records, and suggested that the BOM showed a lack of commitment to scientific accuracy.https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db%3DCOMMITTEES;id%3Dcommittees%2Festimate%2F49226b7b-2438-49b8-8f8a-94857366c5de%2F0003;query%3DId%3A%22committees%2Festimate%2F49226b7b-2438-49b8-8f8a-94857366c5de%2F0000%22 When questioning the CSRIO, Rennick based part of his argument on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The scientist questioned had to correct Rennick on his understanding of the theory. Many of Rennick's questions to the BOM were taken on notice. BOM director, Andrew Johnson responded to these accusations by stating that the \\"Bureau stand[s] by the quality and integrity of those datasets.‚Äùhttps://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=COMMITTEES;id=committees%2Festimate%2F49226b7b-2438-49b8-8f8a-94857366c5de%2F0003;query=Id%3A%22committees%2Festimate%2F49226b7b-2438-49b8-8f8a-94857366c5de%2F0000%22 Rennick has challenged BOM on the margin of error in their thermometers, which according to the independent panel's findings, should be reduced from ¬±0.5¬∞C to ¬±0.2¬∞C. The BOM has not replied to Rennick's queries about the implementation of procedures recommended by the 2011 review, although the BOM did agree in 2012 to tighten the error margins in their response to the independent review, and has shown progress in implementing this. The BOM also reported that the 6-monthly checks of their weather stations showed that 97% were within 0.2 ¬∞C and 99.5% of the stations were within 0.5 ¬∞C. Senator Murray Watt called Rennick's BOM allegations \\"nuts\\", adding that such allegations were sourced \\"from right-wing think tanks\\". Rennick has admitted that many of his opinions are sourced from biologist Jennifer Marohasy, who represents the Institute of Public Affairs, a right wing think tank in part funded by coal magnate, Gina Rinehart. =Superannuation= On 13 November 2019 Rennick called superannuation a \\"cancer\\", stating in his speech; \\"Millions of dollars gets sucked out of the pockets of the battlers in the bush and sent to the blowhards in Sydney and Melbourne to manage, all for a small cost of around $37 billion a year in management fees.\\" He said union- linked industry super funds were \\"laughing all the way to the bank\\" while no money was reinvested in regional areas. In the same speech he accused the Labor party of selling regional Australia \\"down the toilet\\" during the Hawke- Keating era through their globalist, privatisation agenda - selling off such government owned corporations as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. \\"Now regional Australia has to pay more for flying regionally than it costs to fly overseas...The CBA, like every other bank in this country, became obsessed with housing rather than driving business and investment, especially in the regions.\\" =Childcare= He called Labor's policy of providing free childcare to all 3 year olds in Australia a conspiracy \\"to strengthen the role the state has in raising a child at the expense of parents.\\" Rennick's position is that \\"subject to financial considerations, if we can leave children at home with at least one parent, that's something worth striving for,\\" but he suggested that \\"early childhood education is... not the best way to invest in our future\\". = Foreign relations = Rennick has advocated for closer ties with Russia because \\"they're part of the West; they drink, they're Christians, they play soccer, they're Caucasian\\". Rennick has called for deescalating tensions with Vladimir Putin and Russia; \\"They are a genuine superpower and it‚Äôs not in the world‚Äôs interest to have antagonistic relations with superpowers...There‚Äôs a bigger picture here and it is world peace.\\" Rennick raised doubts that Russia was behind the Skripal chemical weapons attack in the United Kingdom. Rennick is a non-interventionist and has spoken out against regime change wars. He outlined his position clearly during his maiden speech. = Immigration = Rennick has compared Australia's immigration policy to farmers who \\"overstock [their] paddock\\", and has claimed that immigration was more damaging to Australia's environment than carbon pollution. He also wants a reduction in the number of temporary visa holders in Australia which numbers over 2 million. = Other positions = Rennick has been a long term advocate for reforming the federation; government building and retaining profit making infrastructure such as dams, ports and electricity power plants; sustainable immigration to ensure quality of life for all Australians; higher taxes on profits sent offshore; and he has called on universities to underwrite the costs of education. Rennick opposes the closing of maternity wards by the state government in regional Queensland.https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansards/644bd0ba-8cda-49ec-8c32-397474f759c5/&sid;=0030 https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/tableOffice/questionsAnswers/2006/30-2006.pdf Rennick is also opposed to the adoption of poker machines in the state of Queensland.

The company was established in 1979 by Chimanlal Mehta born in Jain family from Gujarat, as a private limited company and became public limited in 1982. The company has marketed fertilizers under the brand name of \\"Mahadhan\\" since 1990.  Chemicals  The company's products include nitric acid, low-density prilled ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrophosphate (ANP), methanol and methanol-based resins, dry ice, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and threose nucleic acid (TNA). DFPCL is one of the five major Indian companies that produce methanol, the other four being Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers & Chemicals, Assam Petro-Chemicals Limited, Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers and National Fertilizers Limited. DFPCL is also a producer of Technical Ammonium Nitrate (TAN), which is used in the agricultural and chemical industries and as an explosive in the mining and infrastructure industries. Until 2014, imports of TAN from Russia and Ukraine in loose form were high. TAN has also been used by anti-social elements and naxalites in terrorism-related activities in combination with fuel oil to create the explosive product ANFO. The control and guidelines on TAN manufacturing and supply have since been made stringent by government. According to Indian Ammonium Nitrate Manufacturers' Association (IANMA), TAN market in India in 2012 was of nearly 650-700 thousand tonnes a year; and DFPCL sold 200 thousand tonnes although their installed capacity was nearly 500 tonnes per year. Conforming to stringent government regulations, DFPCL has introduced a GPS system for trucks transporting TAN to keep better surveillance. In January 2018, the company underwent restructuring after approval from National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and formed a wholly owned subsidiary Smartchem Technologies Ltd which covered the portfolios of fertiliser and technical ammonium nitrate. In July 2018, Smartchem reported sale of 35,000 tonnes in Maharashtra and Gujarat of their newly launched organic compound coated NPK complexes (Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)) and branded as \\"Mahadhan Smartek\\". The company has faced shutdown due to 2005 monsoon floods when its Taloja plant was submerged. In May 2014, on the request of the Department of Fertilisers, the Petroleum Ministry stopped the supply of domestic natural gas to Taloja plant, citing the use of the cheap domestic gas to manufacture non-subsidised crop nutrients. DFPCL moved Delhi High Court against this move. DFPCL in June 2015 switched to imported RLNG as feedstock to avoid further loss of production. = Plants = The company has a corporate and registered office in Pune, Maharashtra and four productions plants in various locations in India: * Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh * Taloja, Raigad, Maharashtra * Dahej, Bharuch, Gujarat * Panipat, Haryana  Real Estate  The company owns a mall named Creaticity in Pune, Maharashtra, occupying a site of over in area.

At times, it also corresponded to a single super- province, under a strategos \\"in charge of the upper satrapies\\" (). Extent The Upper Satrapies comprised the entire eastern half of the territories conquered by Alexander: typically everything east of the River Tigris, from the Zagros Mountains in the west to the borders of India in the southeast and Central Asia in the northeast, including the provinces of Media, Persis, Karmania, Drangiane, Hyrkania, Parthia, Margiane, Aria, Baktria, and Sogdiane. The area initially also included the easternmost conquests of Alexander in India and modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan (the Paropamisadai, Arachosia, and Gedrosia), but these were definitely lost to Chandragupta Maurya in 303 BC, after his treaty with Seleucus I Nicator. History =Possible Achaemenid antecedents= It is possible that the concept and province of the \\"Upper Satrapies\\" was created already during the late Achaemenid Empire, where superior military commands covering several satrapies are attested for Asia Minor at least, with scholars hypothesizing also the existence of similar arrangements for the Armenian, Syriac-Babylonian and eastern satrapies. The evidence for the eastern satrapies is based on a statement by Diodorus of Sicily that Artaxerxes III entrusted the Upper Satrapies to Bagoas, but this may be an anachronism, and no other piece of evidence survives indicating any continuity between the Achaemenid and Hellenistic periods in this regard. =Establishment under the Diadochi= The first mention of the \\"Upper Satrapies\\" comes from 316 BC, when Peithon was named strategos of Media and of the Upper Satrapies as well by Antigonos I Monophthalmos. Peithon, the satrap of Media, had been elected by the army assembly in 323 BC to supervise the suppression of a revolt by mercenaries in the eastern satrapies, and had received some plenipotentiary powers over the local satraps. Although likely not envisioned at the outset as an overarching military command as it later became, Peithon appears to have attempted to gradually impose just such an authority over the local satraps, which led to the latter banding together against him and evicting him in 217 BC. It was in this context that Antigonos recognized his claims to win him over, although soon after, Antigonos had Peithon arrested and executed. After Peithon's execution, Antigonos appointed two officers to replace him: Orontobates as satrap of Media, and Hippostratos as strategos. According to Hermann Bengtson, Hippostratos occupied an intermediate position between a full strategos of the Upper Satrapies, and a provincial satrap; Hippostratos thus likely commanded the troops of the royal army (the Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπœÇ) stationed in the eastern provinces, while the satraps commanded only their local levies. Hippostratos' appointment was a temporary expediency, and in 315, Antigonos named his general Nikanor as strategos over Media and the Upper Satrapies. The fact that the institution of the post coincided with Antigonos' departure from Babylonia for the Mediterranean to fight against his rivals, and the absence of similar arrangements in the western provinces of his realm, where he was present in person, show that the post was meant to provide for the security of the eastern provinces while Antigonos himself was absent and preoccupied in the west. Nikanor remained in control of the Antigonos' eastern provinces until the invasion of Babylonia by Seleukos I in 312, when he marched to confront him but fell in battle. As a result, the eastern satrapies came under Seleukos' control, and the special command over the Upper Satrapies was abolished for the time being.

Born in Rhos, Morgan began working at the Main Colliery in Bryncoch when he was only nine years old. Despite his limited formal education, he spent his spare time educating himself. When he was eighteen, he broke his thigh and was therefore unable to work. This led him to devote his time to trade unionism; he was elected as the first secretary of a new local miners' union, which in time became the Swansea Valley Miners' Union. In 1895, this became part of the Western Miners' Association, and Morgan continued as secretary. Morgan spoke both Welsh and English. He won election to the Cilybebyll parish council and School Board, which he persuaded to begin teaching in Welsh in addition to English, the first parish in Wales to do so. He also served on the Pontardawe Board of Guardians, and was a governor of the Ystalyfera Intermediate School, and chaired the Alltwen and Pontardawe Co-operative Society. In 1898, the union became the Western District of the South Wales Miners' Federation, Morgan again continuing as secretary, and winning election to its executive council. Two years later, he moved to Swansea and also became the district's sub-agent. At the 1907 Glamorgan County Council election, Morgan stood as a Labour Party candidate in Loughor and Penderry. He was defeated by J. T. D. Llewellyn, despite receiving all but four votes in the district in which he lived. After the election, two voters from the district came forward, claiming that they had voted against him only because they did not wish him to leave the area.

The method preserves certain topological properties of the arrangement of line segments.

The 3 dimensional case is worse, with a polyhedral subdivision of complexity becoming complexity O(n4). There are more refined algorithms to cope with some of these issues, for example iterated snap rounding guarantees a \\"large\\" separation between points and non-incident edges.

In 1846, the opened St. Mary Academy as a boarding school for girls, then located at the corner of Monroe and Elm. At first, the school grew slowly, but the pace quickened in the 1870s, prompting the construction of a new building in 1881. By 1904, a second building was needed; this was constructed at the current site of St. Mary Catholic Central High School. This building was destroyed by fire in 1929. A third building, the present one, was constructed in 1932 on the site of the SSIHM Motherhouse. In 1945, an all-boys school, Monroe Catholic Central, was established at the previous site of the St. Mary Academy. By the 1970s, however, both St. Mary Academy and Monroe Catholic Central were faced with declining enrollment. In 1986, the two schools merged, moving into the Monroe Catholic Central facility to form St. Mary Catholic Central High School. The former St. Mary Academy building was vacated.

Early life  The son of Jacob Joseph Pertschuk and Ethel Muriel (n√©e Sborowfsky), Russian-born Jews who'd become British citizens after escaping pogroms, he was born in Paris on 31 July 1921. In Paris, where his father ran a fur business, Pertschuk attended the Lyc√©e Rollin, but as the French economy worsened, in December 1933, the family moved back to England. Pertschuk finished his education in French, attending the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais in Kensington. The family moved back to France in 1939, where Maurice got a teaching certificate from the University of Lille.  World War II  That September, after England and France declared war with Germany, Pertschuk returned to London to volunteer for the British Army. By 1940 he was called up by the Royal Sussex Regiment.Paul McCue Books - Lieutenant Maurice PERTSCHUK As a bilingual bi-cultural dual French-British national, he was recruited by the Special Operations ExecutiveThe National Archives : HS 9/1172/7 - Maurice PERTSCHUK, and joined the French Section.

Once on the ground, he connected with members of the CARTE organization, who helped him get established in Toulouse, at first as a Political Warfare Executive agent, gathering intelligence, providing instruction, distributing anti-German propaganda, leaflets and tracts. Later switching to SOE, he organized his PRUNUS network for sabotage and stocking arms, with the help of Dr. Marcel Petit, Robert Vuillemot, Lucien Fayman and Philippe de Gunzbourg. PRUNUS eventually developed cells in the Landes, Gers, Hautes Pyren√©es, Haute Garonne, Lot and Lot-et-Garonne. Wireless operator Marcus Bloom later joined the group. The WHEELWRIGHT network of George Starr had no wireless operator to contact London and relied on help from the neighbouring PRUNUS circuit. In April 1943, Pertschuk was given a mission to blow up the Toulouse gunpowder factory at Empalot. SOE arranged for him meet a foreman working there, Robert Moog, who turned out to be a double agent working for the Abwehr. On 12 April the SD arrested Pertschuk, Bloom, and 14 of their key colleagues, and the network collapsed, though de Gunzbourg escaped and transferred to the WHEELWRIGHT network. Robert Moog then went on to arrest many key members of the Gilbert circuit, and worked closely with Klaus Barbie in Lyon in planning the arrest of the iconic leader of the National Council of the Resistance, Jean Moulin.

He studied in northern Italian cities for the priesthood while he did his Franciscan formation before serving as a professor in Rome in addition to holding several other important positions. Beschin was noted for his spiritual direction and for having been a good confessor while he spent most of his career spearheading efforts for the beatification cause of Bernardino da Portogruaro (having been the vice-postulator for his order). Beschin also had served in several leadership roles during his time as a priest that saw him move often from the north to Rome. The beatification cause for the late priest was introduced in late 1978 and he became titled as a Servant of God at the outset. The cause reached a decisive moment in 2017 when he became titled as Venerable after Pope Francis signed a decree acknowledging his heroic virtue. Life Giuseppe Beschin was born on 26 August 1880 in San Giovanni Ilarione in the Verona province as the ninth of eleven children to the pious peasants Arcangelo Beschin and Luigia Zanmichele. He told his sister Maria (whom he was close to) when he was eight of his desire to pursue the priesthood but his older sister did not think that he was prepared for that path. His sister not long after died from typhus due to a spread of the disease and he himself contracted but recovered from typhoid fever around that time not long after her death. Beschin confided to his parents of his desire to become a priest when he turned thirteen and it was a goal that his parents supported. He commenced his ecclesial studies in Chiampo at the Collegio Serafico after he turned fifteen under the rector Father Pasquale Angelico Melotto (who died in China in 1923 in the missions during a time of persecution). He commenced his novitiate period in the Order of Friars Minor on 12 September 1895 in the San Francesco del Deserto convent as \\"Ignazio\\" and was vested in the order's religious habit before making his initial vows in 1896. Beschin underwent his Franciscan formation in Monselice in Padua and Rovinj in Pula-Istria (in Croatia) before relocating to Venice where he made his solemn profession on 2 August 1902. He also did part of his education (going on to earn a doctorate in theological studies) for the priesthood in Rome in the Pontificia Universit√† Antonianum. It was there in Rome that two of his classmates were the Servant of God Ginepro Cocchi and Blessed Gabriele Allegra (both of whom served in China). Beschin received his ordination to the priesthood in Venice on 10 August 1903 from Auxiliary Bishop Aristide Cavallari. The latter ordained him because the Patriarch of Venice had just been elected as Pope Pius X the week before. He celebrated his first Mass as a priest in his hometown on 8 September 1903. He taught Franciscan students and seminarians in Lonigo and later in Venice after his ordination. He also returned to his alma mater to serve as a professor of canon law. His duties were interrupted due to World War I which saw him serve in the war for 32 months tending to wounded soldiers (as a chaplain) or cleaning the stables and latrines. Beschin was at some point appointed as the order's vice-postulator (an official spearheading Franciscan sainthood causes) and since at least 1919 started to support and promote a cause for Bernardino da Portogruaro. The cause did not launch until 1951 due to some discrepancies that required the order's clarifications to appease the Congregation for Rites. Beschin was also appointed as the general visitor for various Franciscan provinces and was later made the director for the Third Order Franciscans in Rome whom he provided spiritual assistance to. He also provided spiritual assistance to the Daughters of Saint Francis who were based in Pisa. Beschin suffered a serious illness at one point forcing him to take leave; he returned to his teaching duties and other responsibilities after he recovered. He also was appointed as a consultant to the Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes in the Roman Curia not long after his return to Rome. Beschin was appointed in 1937 as the Provincial Minister for the Franciscans in the Venetian Province and served two terms (1937‚Äì40 and 1940‚Äì44) in that role until 1944. Upon his return to Rome at the end of his term he was made the dean for confessors of the Lateran Basilica where he distinguished himself for his qualities as a gentle confessor and popular spiritual director. Beschin became known in Rome for his simple living as well as for his gentleness and discretion. These latter two qualities made him sought after as a confessor and for spiritual direction. These qualities were also among those noted among his peers. He retired in 1950 due to heart problems but in 1951 at last could open the beatification process for Bernardino da Portogruaro. This came about after he - in summer 1951 - was in Rome clearing up discrepancies that could have impeded the cause. He returned from Rome to the north and made a brief stop in Chiampo. Beschin died on 29 October 1952 in Chiampo due to his heart ailments and his remains were interred though later relocated to the Santa Maria della Pieve church in Chiampo. Beatification process The beatification process was activated on 22 September 1978 (one of the few managed in the pontificate of Pope John Paul I) after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued a \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) declaration that enabled for the cause to commence. This also saw Beschin titled as a Servant of God. It opened on a diocesan level in a cognitional process that Bishop Arnoldo Onisto inaugurated on 3 May 1980 and closed soon after sometime in 1981. The C.C.S. validated this process as having abided to their regulations for diocesan processes on 13 November 1992. The postulation submitted the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 1993 for additional assessment though this did not happen for two decades. Nine theologians gave their approval to the cause on 10 June 2014 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members at some stage later. Beschin became titled as Venerable on 20 January 2017 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged that Beschin had practiced heroic virtue throughout his life. The current postulator for the cause is the Franciscan priest Giovangiuseppe Califano.

Kubeflow was based on Google's internal method to deploy TensorFlow models to Kubernetes called TensorFlow Extended.  Kubeflow Overview  Kubeflow is a free and open-sourced project designed to make running Machine Learning workflows on Kubernetes clusters simpler and more coordinated. This is a Cloud-Native framework for employing Machine Learning in containerized environments in Kubernetes. Kubeflow's integration with and extension of Kubernetes has become seamless and Kubeflow has been designed to run everywhere Kubernetes runs: on- prem, GCP, AWS, Azure, etc. Kubeflow began as an internal Google project as a simpler & easier way to run TensorFlow jobs on Kubernetes, based specifically on the TensorFlow Extended pipeline. Google open-source engineers David Aronchick, Jeremy Lewi and Vishnu Kannan co-founded the Kubeflow project and after its initial release at Kubecon companies such as Google, Arrikto, Cisco, IBM, Red Hat, CoreOS and CaiCloud began publicly contributing to the GitHub issue board.  What is Kubeflow?  At its core, Kubeflow offers an end-to-end ML stack orchestration toolkit to build on Kubernetes as a way to deploy, scale and manage complex systems.https://www.slideshare.net/jwiegelmann/endtoend-machine-learning-stack Features such as running JupyterHub servers allowing multiple users to contribute to a project simultaneously has become an invaluable asset of Kubeflow. Detailed management of a project and in depth monitoring/analyzing of said project are paramount attributes in Kubeflow. Data scientists and engineers are now able to develop a complete pipeline composed of segmented steps. These segmented steps in Kubeflow are loosely coupled components of an ML pipeline, a feature not core to other frameworks, allowing pipelines to become easily reusable and modifiable for other jobs. This added flexibility has the potential to save an incalculable amount of labor necessary to develop a new data pipeline for each specific use case. Through this process, Kubeflow aims to simplify Kubernetes deployments while also accounting for future needs of portability and scalability.  Kubeflow Roadmap  Kubeflow 1.0 was announced to the public on February 26, 2020 via the Kubeflow blog post.https://medium.com/kubeflow/kubeflow-1-0-cloud-native-ml-for- everyone-a3950202751 The 1.0 release is available through the public github repository. Specifically, Kubeflow 1.0 signifies the solidification of the following core Kubeflow components: Kubeflow's UI - the central dashboard, Jupyter notebook controller and web app, Tensorflow Operator (TFJob) and PyTorch Operator for distributed training, kfctl for deployment and upgrades, Profile Controller and UI for multiuser management.
