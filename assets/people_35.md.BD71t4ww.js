A two-time Olympic champion in the 100 meters for the USA, her 1996 win made her only the second woman (after Wyomia Tyus) to successfully defend an Olympic 100m title. She won a third Olympic gold medal in the 4 √ó 100 m relay in 1996. She is also the 1993 World champion in the 100m and a three-time World champion in the 100m hurdles. In 2011, she was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. Life and career Devers was born in Seattle, Washington, and grew up near National City, California, graduating from Sweetwater High School in 1984. (Sweetwater's football and track stadium would later be named Gail Devers Stadium.) A young talent in the 100 m and 100 m hurdles, Devers was in training for the 1988 Summer Olympics, started experiencing health problems, suffering from among others migraine and vision loss. She qualified for the Olympics 100 m hurdles, in which she was eliminated in the semi-finals, but her health continued to deteriorate even further. In 1990, she was diagnosed with Graves' disease and underwent radioactive iodine treatment followed by thyroid hormone replacement therapy. During her radiation treatment, Devers began to develop blistering and swelling of her feet. Eventually, the sprinter could barely walk and had to crawl and or be carried. A doctor considered amputating her feet. Amazingly, Devers recovered after the radiation treatment was discontinued, and she resumed training. At the 1991 World Championships, she won a silver medal in the 100 m hurdles. At the 1992 Summer Olympics, Devers starred. She qualified for the final of the 100 m, which ended in an exciting finish, with five women finishing close (within 0.06 seconds). The photo finish showed Devers had narrowly beaten Jamaican Juliet Cuthbert. In the final of the 100 m hurdles, Devers' lead event, she seemed to be running towards a second gold medal, when she hit the final hurdle and stumbled over the finish line in fifth place, leaving Voula Patoulidou from Greece as the upset winner. In 1993, Devers won the 100 m World Championship title after - again - a photo finish win over Merlene Ottey in an apparent dead heat, and the 100 m hurdles title. She retained her hurdles title in 1995. The 100 m final at the 1996 Summer Olympics was an almost exact repeat of the World Championships final three years before. Ottey and Devers again finished in the same time and did not know who had won the race. Again, both were awarded the same time of 10.94 seconds, but Devers was judged to have finished first and became the first woman to retain the Olympic 100 m title since Wyomia Tyus. Shelly-Ann Fraser- Pryce duplicated the feat in 2012. In the final of her favorite event, Devers again failed, as she finished fourth and outside of the medals. With the 4 √ó 100 m relay team, Devers won her third Olympic gold medal. After these Olympics, Devers concentrated on the hurdles event, winning the World Championship again in 1999, but she had to forfeit for the semi-finals at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Devers competed in the 100 m and 100 m hurdles at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, her fifth Olympic Games.https://www.iaaf.org/athletes/united-states/gail-devers-60432 Devers left competition in 2005 to give birth to a child with her husband and returned in 2006. On February 2, 2007, at the age of 40, Devers edged 2004 Olympic champion Joanna Hayes to win the 60 m hurdles event at the Millrose Games in 7.86 seconds - the best time in the world that season and just 0.12 off the record she set in 2003. Furthermore, the time bettered the listed World Record for a 40-year-old by almost 7 tenths of a second. WMA World Indoor Record During her career, Devers was notable for having exceptionally long, heavily decorated fingernails. One of the fastest starters in the world, Devers even had to alter her starting position to accommodate her long nails. Her long nails came as the result of a contest her father devised to get her to stop biting her nails as a child.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n5_v52/ai_19201548/ Devers' brother was IFBB Professional Bodybuilder Parenthesis \\"PD\\" Devers. Achievements and recognition In 2011, she was elected into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. The following year she was elected into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame.

Commensalism is a long-term biological interaction (symbiosis) in which members of one species gain benefits while those of the other species neither benefit nor are harmed. This is in contrast with mutualism, in which both organisms benefit from each other; amensalism, where one is harmed while the other is unaffected; and parasitism, where one is harmed and the other benefits. The commensal (the species that benefits from the association) may obtain nutrients, shelter, support, or locomotion from the host species, which is substantially unaffected. The commensal relation is often between a larger host and a smaller commensal; the host organism is unmodified, whereas the commensal species may show great structural adaptation consistent with its habits, as in the remoras that ride attached to sharks and other fishes. Remoras feed on their hosts' fecal matter, while pilot fish feed on the leftovers of their hosts' meals. Numerous birds perch on bodies of large mammal herbivores or feed on the insects turned up by grazing mammals. Etymology The word \\"commensalism\\" is derived from the word \\"commensal\\", meaning \\"eating at the same table\\" in human social interaction, which in turn comes through French from the Medieval Latin commensalis, meaning \\"sharing a table\\", from the prefix com-, meaning \\"together\\", and mensa, meaning \\"table\\" or \\"meal\\". Commensality, at the Oxford and the Cambridge Universities, refers to professors eating at the same table as students (as they live in the same \\"college\\"). Pierre-Joseph van Beneden introduced the term \\"commensalism\\" in 1876.van Beneden, Pierre-Joseph (1876). Animal parasites and messmates. London, Henry S. King. link.  Examples of commensal relationships  The commensal pathway was traveled by animals that fed on refuse around human habitats or by animals that preyed on other animals drawn to human camps. Those animals established a commensal relationship with humans in which the animals benefited but the humans received little benefit or harm. Those animals that were most capable of taking advantage of the resources associated with human camps would have been the 'tamer' individuals: less aggressive, with shorter fight-or-flight distances. Later, these animals developed closer social or economic bonds with humans and led to a domestic relationship. The leap from a synanthropic population to a domestic one could only have taken place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to habituation, to commensalism and partnership, at which point the establishment of a reciprocal relationship between animal and human would have laid the foundation for domestication, including captivity and then human-controlled breeding. From this perspective, animal domestication is a coevolutionary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel niche that includes another species with evolving behaviors. Commensal pathway animals include dogs, cats, fowl, and possibly pigs. =Dogs= The dog was the first domesticated animal, and was domesticated and widely established across Eurasia before the end of the Pleistocene, well before the cultivation of crops or the domestication of other animals. The dog is often hypothesised to be a classic example of a domestic animal that likely traveled a commensal pathway into domestication. Archaeological evidence, such as the Bonn- Oberkassel dog dating to ~14,000BP, supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture and began close to the Last Glacial Maximum when hunter-gatherers preyed on megafauna. The wolves more likely drawn to human camps were the less-aggressive, subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress thresholds, and less wary around humans, and therefore better candidates for domestication. Proto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kills. However, the extent to which proto-domestic wolves could have become dependent on this way of life prior to domestication and without human provisioning is unclear and highly debated. In contrast, cats may have become fully dependent on a commensal lifestyle before being domesticated by preying on other commensal animals, such as rats and mice, without any human provisioning. Debate over the extent to which some wolves were commensal with humans prior to domestication stems from debate over the level of human intentionality in the domestication process, which remains untested. The earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the neotonization of skull morphology and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a reduction in the number of teeth, which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression. This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process. A mitochondrial, microsatellite, and Y-chromosome assessment of two wolf populations in North America combined with satellite telemetry data revealed significant genetic and morphological differences between one population that migrated with and preyed upon caribou and another territorial ecotype population that remained in a boreal coniferous forest. Although these two populations spend a period of the year in the same place, and though there was evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in prey‚Äìhabitat specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration divergence. A different study has identified the remains of a population of extinct Pleistocene Beringian wolves with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these remains were derived from a population of specialist megafauna hunters and scavengers that became extinct while less specialized wolf ecotypes survived. Analogous to the modern wolf ecotype that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers, thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have allowed them to more successfully adapt to the human habitat. =Aspergillus and Staphylococcus= Numerous genera of bacteria and fungi live on and in the human body as part of its natural flora. The fungal genus Aspergillus is capable of living under considerable environmental stress, and thus is capable of colonising the upper gastrointestinal tract where relatively few examples of the body's gut flora can survive due to highly acidic or alkaline conditions produced by gastric acid and digestive juices. While Aspergillus normally produces no symptoms, in individuals who are immunocompromised or suffering from existing conditions such as tuberculosis, a condition called aspergillosis can occur, in which populations of Aspergillus grow out of control. Staphylococcus aureus, a common bacterial species, is known best for its numerous pathogenic strains that can cause numerous illnesses and conditions. However, many strains of S. aureus are metabiotic commensals, and are present on roughly 20 to 30% of the human population as part of the skin flora. S. aureus also benefits from the variable ambient conditions created by the body's mucous membranes, and as such can be found in the oral and nasal cavities, as well as inside the ear canal. Other Staphylococcus species including S. warneri, S. lugdunensis and S. epidermidis, will also engage in commensalism for similar purposes. = Nitrosomonas spp and Nitrobacter spp = Commensalistic relationships between microorganisms include situations in which the waste product of one microorganism is a substrate for another species. One good example is nitrification-the oxidation of ammonium ion to nitrate. Nitrification occurs in two steps: first, bacteria such as Nitrosomonas spp. and certain crenarchaeotes oxidize ammonium to nitrite; and second, nitrite is oxidized to nitrate by Nitrobacter spp. and similar bacteria. Nitrobacter spp. benefit from their association with Nitrosomonas spp. because they use nitrite to obtain energy for growth. Commensalistic associations also occur when one microbial group modifies the environment to make it better suited for another organism. The synthesis of acidic waste products during fermentation stimulates the proliferation of more acid- tolerant microorganisms, which may be only a minor part of the microbial community at neutral pH. A good example is the succession of microorganisms during milk spoilage. Biofilm formation provides another example. The colonization of a newly exposed surface by one type of microorganism (an initial colonizer) makes it possible for other microorganisms to attach to the microbially modified surface.  Arguments  Whether the relationship between humans and some types of gut flora is commensal or mutualistic is still unanswered. Some biologists argue that any close interaction between two organisms is unlikely to be completely neutral for either party, and that relationships identified as commensal are likely mutualistic or parasitic in a subtle way that has not been detected. For example, epiphytes are \\"nutritional pirates\\" that may intercept substantial amounts of nutrients that would otherwise go to the host plant. Large numbers of epiphytes can also cause tree limbs to break or shade the host plant and reduce its rate of photosynthesis. Similarly, phoretic mites may hinder their host by making flight more difficult, which may affect its aerial hunting ability or cause it to expend extra energy while carrying these passengers.  Types  Phoretic mites on a fly (Pseudolynchia canariensis) Like all ecological interactions, commensalisms vary in strength and duration from intimate, long-lived symbioses to brief, weak interactions through intermediaries. = Phoresy = Phoresy is one animal attached to another exclusively for transport, mainly arthropods, examples of which are mites on insects (such as beetles, flies or bees), pseudoscorpions on mammals or beetles, and millipedes on birds. Phoresy can be either obligate or facultative (induced by environmental conditions). = Inquilinism = Inquilinism: Tillandsia bourgaei growing on an oak tree in Mexico Inquilinism is the use of a second organism for permanent housing. Examples are epiphytic plants (such as many orchids) that grow on trees,C. Michael Hogan. 2011. Commensalism. Topic Ed. M.Mcginley. Ed-in-chief C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC or birds that live in holes in trees. = Metabiosis = Metabiosis is a more indirect dependency, in which one organism creates or prepares a suitable environment for a second. Examples include maggots, which feast and develop on corpses, and hermit crabs, which use gastropod shells to protect their bodies.

He resigned from that office in October 2002 after having been elected as a member of the Bundestag, the parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany. There was a rule in the Green Party in those days that you could not be an MP and hold a party office at the same time. = Member of the parliament of Germany, 2002‚Äì2012= Fritz Kuhn first became a member of the Bundestag in the 2002 federal elections. In the immediate aftermath of the elections, he was part of the Green Party's team in the negotiations with the Social Democrats on a coalition agreement for the second government under the leadership of Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der. In the Bundestag, Kuhn specialized in the fields of the economy (fighting for \\"a green market economy\\"http://www.gruene- bundestag.de/cms/abgeordnete/dok/81/81511.html) and employment, and foreign policy. From 2002 until 2005, he served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

She was one of the two party chairs from 2004 to 2013 and currently serves as one of the vice presidents of the Bundestag.  Biography  Claudia Roth began her artistic work, which she always regarded as also being political, in the 1970s as a trained artistic director at a theatre in Memmingen. She then worked at the municipal theatre in Dortmund and the Hoffmanns-Comic-Teater, and subsequently began managing the political rock band \\"Ton Steine Scherben\\" until 1985, when the band disbanded due to the band's high debt burden. She came into contact with the Green party on election campaign tours. In 1985, she became press spokesperson for the Green Party's parliamentary group in the Bundestag, despite being a newcomer to this line of work. = Member of the European Parliament = In West Germany's 1989 European elections, Roth was elected for the first time as a Member of the European Parliament for the Greens. Roth served as a member of the new Committee on Civic Liberties and Internal Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Sub-Committee on Human Rights. In addition, she was a member of two committees of inquiry in the European Parliament, namely the Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia and the Committee of Inquiry into Links between Organized Crime and Drugs, as well as of the EC-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee. From 1989 to 1990, Roth briefly served as deputy chairperson of the Green Group in the European Parliament. In the 1994 European elections, Roth was again elected to the European Parliament as a lead candidate of Alliance 90/The Greens. She was chairperson of the Green Group in the European Parliament until 1998, first alongside co-chairman Alexander Langer (1994‚Äì1995) and later Magda Aelvoet (1995‚Äì1998). During this second term as an MEP, she was again a member of the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Sub-Committee on Human Rights and the EC-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, of which she was elected deputy chairperson. She also remained involved with the Committee on Foreign Affairs as a substitute member. = Member of the German Bundestag = Roth in 2005 Claudia Roth ended her work as an MEP when she became part of the Alliance 90/The Greens parliamentary group in the Bundestag after the 1998 German federal election. She became a member of the Committee on the Affairs of the European Union and a substitute member of the Committee on Internal Affairs of the German Bundestag. Furthermore, she was elected chairperson of the newly established Committee on Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid. On 9 March 2001, Roth was elected Federal chairperson of Alliance 90/The Greens at the party conference in Stuttgart and resigned as a Member of the Bundestag at the end of March 2001 as a result. At the same time, she was spokesperson of the Alliance 90/The Greens on women's affairs. In the 2002 national elections, Roth was elected to the Bundestag as Bavarian lead candidate for Alliance 90/The Greens. Since then, she has been a member of the Bundestag's Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Cultural and Media Affairs. She is also cultural affairs spokesperson for the Alliance 90/The Greens parliamentary group in the Bundestag and chairperson of the German-Turkish Parliamentary Friendship Group. Between March 2003 and October 2004, in Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der‚Äôs second cabinet, Roth served as the Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid at the Federal Foreign Office.The Commissioner for Human Rights Policy Foreign Office (Germany) Roth became federal chairperson of Alliance 90/The Greens again in October 2004 and was re-elected as such several times, most recently in November 2010. In 2012, she failed to become the number one woman in the campaign for the 2013 national elections. After this defeat she was unsure to run again for the position of leader of the party's board. Fellow party member Volker Beck started a support campaign in favour of her in social media networks and called it candystorm. The party members subsequently re-elected Roth with 88.5 percent backing.Erik Kirschbaum (17 November 2012), German Greens avoid split by re-electing leftist Reuters. Roth served as deputy chairwoman of the German-Iranian Parliamentary Friendship Group between 2005 and 2009 and held the same office in the German-Turkish Friendship Group between 2005 and 2013. =Vice-President of the German Bundestag= Roth was elected as Vice-President of the German Bundestag on 22 October 2013.

Ectosymbiosis is form of symbiotic behavior in which a parasite lives on the body surface of the host, including internal surfaces such as the lining of the digestive tube and the ducts of glands. The parasitic species is generally an immobile, or sessile, organism existing off of biotic substrate through mutualism, commensalism, or parasitism. Ectosymbiosis is found throughout a diverse array of environments and in many different species. In some species the symbiotic environment provided by both the parasite and host are mutually beneficial. In recent research it has been found that these micro-flora will evolve and diversify rapidly in response to a change in the external environment, in order to stabilize and maintain a beneficial ectosymbiotic environment.  Evolutionary History  Ectosymbiosis has evolved independently many times to fill a wide variety of ecological niches, both temperate and extreme. Such temperate regions include the seas off the coast of Singapore while the extreme regions reach to the depths of Antarctica and hydrothermal vents. It likely evolved as a niche specialization, which allowed for greater diversity in ectosymbiotic behavior among species. Additionally, in the case of mutualism, the evolution improved the fitness of both species involved, propagating the success of ectosymbiosis. Ectosymbiosis has independently evolved through convergent evolution in all domains of life. Sea urchins, with their many spines provide protection for the ectosymbiotic parasites that live on them. Ectosymbiosis allows niches to form that would otherwise be unable to exist without the support of their host. Inherently this added niche opens up a new branch off of the evolutionary tree The evolutionary success of ectosymbiosis is based on the benefits experienced by the parasite and the host. Due to the dependence of the parasite on the host and the associated benefits and cost to both the parasite and host, the two will continue to coevolve as explained by the Red Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen hypothesis states that a host will continually evolve defenses against a parasitic attack, and the parasite species will also adapt to these changes in the host defense. The result being competitive coevolution between the two species. Ectosymbiosis adds to the biodiversity of the environment, whether on land, in freshwater, in deserts, or in deep sea vents. Specifically, ectosymbiosis provides a new niche or environment for species to from which many new species can differentiate and flourish. This niche specialization between species also leads to stabilization of symbiotic relationships between sessile and motile organisms. The ectosymbiotes can increase the fitness of their host by assisting with metabolism, nitrogen fixation, or cleaning the host organism. The diversity of advantages has yet to be fully explored, but by virtue of persisting throughout all of recent evolution, they likely confer an adaptive advantage to many of the species that exist solely due to ectosymbiosis. Remora fish form ectosymbiotic commensalism interactions with a lemon shark in order to scavenge food and travel long distances.  Types of Host and Parasite Dynamic  Although, ectosymbiosis is typically an evolutionary stable behavior, the different host and parasite dynamics independently vary in their stability. = Commensalism = Commensalism is a form of symbiosis where one species is benefiting from the interactions between species and the other is neither helped nor harmed from the interaction. Ectosymbiotic commensalistic behavior is found frequently in organisms that attach themselves to larger species in order to move long distances or scavenge food easily; this is documented in remoras which attach to sharks to scavenge and travel.Britz, R. & G. D. Johnson. 2012. Ontogeny and homology of the skeletal elements that form the sucking disc of remoras (Teleostei, Echeneoidei, Echeneidae). Journal of Morphology, 273 (12) 1353-1366 , DOI: 10.1002/jmor.20063 An additional ectosymbiotic example of commensalism is the relationship between small sessile organisms and echinoids in the Southern ocean, where the echinoids provide substrate for the small organisms to grow and the echinoids remain unaffected. Branchiobdellid annelids are mutualistic parasites. They will attach to a signal crayfish and feed on diatoms, bacteria, and protozoans that accumulate on the exoskeleton. = Mutualism = Mutualism is a form of ectosymbiosis where both the host and parasitic species benefit from the interaction. There are many examples of mutualistic ectosymbiosis that occur in nature. One such relationship is between Branchiobdellida and crayfish in which the Branchiobdellida acts as a bacterial gut cleaner for the crayfish species. Another example is the iron-oxide associated chemoautotrophic bacteria found crusted to the gills of Rimicaris exoculata shrimp that provide the shrimp with vital organic material for their survival while simultaneously supporting the bacteria with different organic material that the bacterial cannot produce itself. Groups of organisms, that is greater than a single pair of a host and parasite, can also form mutualistic ectosymbiotic interactions. Bark beetles can work in a dynamic mutualistic fashion with fungi and mites attached to their exoskeletons, both of which feed off of trees to provide vital energy to the beetles while the beetles provide necessary organic material to the fungi and mites to survive. In this case, the relationship between the fungi and mites is functional because while both do the same job, they are optimally functional at different temperatures. Mutualist interactions can be evolutionary unstable because of the constant battle to maximize one's self- benefits. This is due to the limited benefits offered to both the parasite and the host, with the possible outcome for at least one of the species to die out if the other species begins to take advantage of the other. In the case that the mutualistic behavior persists for enough generations, the dynamic can evolve into parasitism, which is a more stable dynamic due to the increased benefit to the parasite that propagates the behavior. In this case the parasite takes advantage of the previously mutualistic host and parasite dynamic, gaining greater benefits for itself. The head louse is an ectosymbiotic parasite that feeds off of the blood of humans by attaching itself to the scalp. = Parasitism = Parasitism is a form of symbiosis in which one species benefits from the interactions between species while the other organism is actively harmed. This is the most common form of ectosymbiotic interactions. One of the many examples of ectosymbiotic parasites includes head lice in humans, which feed off of the blood of humans by attaching to the scalp of a humans head. Additionally, mature Branchiobdellida bacteria act as a nutrient thief in the gut of crayfish species to exist. In these cases, the head lice and the Branchiobdellida are both parasites interacting with host species.

She served as Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005 and as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 2000 to 2018.Government continues as acting government, bundeskanzlerin.de, 24 October 2017 A member of the Christian Democratic Union, Merkel is the first female Chancellor of Germany.She is known in German as Bundeskanzlerin. Bundeskanzlerin is a grammatically regular formation of a noun denoting a female chancellor, adding \\"-in\\" to the end of Bundeskanzler, though the word was not used officially before Merkel. Merkel has been widely described as the de facto leader of the European Union and the most powerful woman in the world. Merkel was born in Hamburg in then-West Germany, moving to East Germany as an infant when her father, a Lutheran clergyman, received a pastorate in Perleberg. She obtained a doctorate in quantum chemistry in 1986 and worked as a research scientist until 1989. Merkel entered politics in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, briefly serving as deputy spokesperson for the first democratically elected East German Government led by Lothar de Maizi√®re. Following German reunification in 1990, Merkel was elected to the Bundestag for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As the prot√©g√©e of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Merkel was appointed as Minister for Women and Youth in 1991, later becoming Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in 1994. After the CDU lost the 1998 federal election, Merkel was elected CDU General Secretary, before becoming the party's first female leader two years later in the aftermath of a donations scandal that toppled Wolfgang Sch√§uble. She was the Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005. Following the 2005 federal election, Merkel was appointed to succeed Gerhard Schr√∂der as Chancellor of Germany, leading a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Merkel is the first woman to be elected chancellor, and the first chancellor since German reunification to have been raised in the former East Germany. At the 2009 federal election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel was able to form a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP). In the 2013 federal election, Merkel's CDU won a landslide victory with 41.5% of the vote and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag. At the 2017 federal election, Merkel led the CDU to become the largest party for the fourth time, and was sworn in for a joint-record fourth term as Chancellor on 14 March 2018. In foreign policy, Merkel has emphasized international cooperation, both in the context of the European Union and NATO, and strengthening transatlantic economic relations. In 2007, Merkel served as President of the European Council and played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. Merkel played a crucial role in managing the global financial crisis and the European debt crisis. She negotiated a stimulus package in 2008 focusing on infrastructure spending and public investment to counteract the Great Recession. In domestic policy, Merkel's \\"Energiewende\\" program has focused on future energy development, seeking to phase out nuclear power in Germany, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase renewable energy sources. Reforms to the Bundeswehr which abolished conscription, Health care reform, and more recently her government's response to the 2010s migrant crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany have been major issues during her chancellorship. She has served as senior G7 leader since 2014, and previously from 2011 to 2012. In 2014 she became the longest-serving incumbent head of government in the European Union. In October 2018, Merkel announced that she would stand down as Leader of the CDU at the party convention in December 2018, and would not seek a fifth term as Chancellor in 2021. Merkel is included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2020. Background and early life Blue Army uniform, and his then-fianc√©e Margarethe, Merkel's grandmother. Merkel was born Angela Dorothea Kasner in 1954, in Hamburg, West Germany, the daughter of Horst Kasner (1926‚Äì2011; n√© Ka≈∫mierczak), a Lutheran pastor and a native of Berlin, and his wife Herlind (1928‚Äì2019; n√©e Jentzsch), born in Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland), a teacher of English and Latin. She has two younger siblings, Marcus Kasner, a physicist, and Irene Kasner, an occupational therapist. In her childhood and youth, Merkel was known among her peers by the nickname \\"Kasi\\", derived from her last name Kasner. Merkel is of German and Polish descent. Her paternal grandfather, Ludwik Kasner, was a German policeman of Polish ethnicity, who had taken part in Poland's struggle for independence in the early 20th century. He married Merkel's grandmother Margarethe, a German from Berlin, and relocated to her hometown where he worked in the police. In 1930, they Germanized the Polish name Ka≈∫mierczak to Kasner. Merkel's maternal grandparents were the Danzig politician Willi Jentzsch, and Gertrud Alma n√©e Drange, a daughter of the city clerk of Elbing (now ElblƒÖg, Poland) Emil Drange. Since the mid 1990s, Merkel has publicly mentioned her Polish heritage on several occasions and described herself as a quarter Polish, but her Polish roots became better known as a result of a 2013 biography. Religion played a key role in the Kasner family's migration from West Germany to East Germany. Merkel's paternal grandfather was originally Catholic but the entire family converted to Lutheranism during the childhood of her father, who later studied Lutheran theology in Heidelberg and Hamburg. In 1954, when Angela was just three months old, her father received a pastorate at the church in (a quarter of Perleberg in Brandenburg), which was then in East Germany. The family moved to Templin and Merkel grew up in the countryside north of East Berlin. Merkel and Lothar de Maizi√®re, 1990 In 1968, Merkel joined the Free German Youth (FDJ), the official communist youth movement sponsored by the ruling Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Membership was nominally voluntary, but those who did not join found it difficult to gain admission to higher education.Hugh C. Dyer, Leon Mangasarian, \\"German Democratic Republic\\", in The Study of International Relations: The State of the Art, p. 328, Springer, 1989, She did not participate in the secular coming of age ceremony Jugendweihe, however, which was common in East Germany. Instead, she was confirmed.The learning machine: Angela Merkel, New Statesman, 8 July 2017 During this time, she participated in several compulsory courses on Marxism- Leninism with her grades only being regarded as \\"sufficient\\". Merkel later said that \\"Life in the GDR was sometimes almost comfortable in a certain way, because there were some things one simply couldn't influence.\\"  Education and scientific career  Merkel was educated at Karl Marx University, Leipzig, where she studied physics from 1973 to 1978. While a student, she participated in the reconstruction of the ruin of the Moritzbastei, a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus. Such an initiative was unprecedented in the GDR of that period, and initially resisted by the University; however, with backing of the local leadership of the SED party, the project was allowed to proceed. At school she learned to speak Russian fluently, and was awarded prizes for her proficiency in Russian and mathematics. She was the best in her class in mathematics and Russian, and completed her school education with the best possible average Abitur grade 1.0. Near the end of her studies, Merkel sought an assistant professorship at an engineering school. As a condition for getting the job, Merkel was told she would need to agree to report on her colleagues to officers of the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). Merkel declined, using the excuse that she could not keep secrets well enough to be an effective spy. Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Adlershof from 1978 to 1990. At first she and her husband squatted in Mitte. At the Academy of Sciences, she became a member of its FDJ secretariat. According to her former colleagues, she openly propagated Marxism as the secretary for \\"Agitation and Propaganda\\". However, Merkel has denied this claim and stated that she was secretary for culture, which involved activities like obtaining theatre tickets and organising talks by visiting Soviet authors. She stated: \\"I can only rely on my memory, if something turns out to be different, I can live with that.\\" After being awarded a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) for her thesis on quantum chemistry in 1986, cited in and listed in the Catalogue of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek under subject code 30 (Chemistry). she worked as a researcher and published several papers. In 1986, she was able to travel freely to West Germany to attend a congress; she also participated in a multi-week language course in Donetsk, in the then-Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.Wie Angela Merkel beinahe Th√ºringerin wurde Th√ºringer Allgemeine (in German) 17 July 2014. Early political career The fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 served as the catalyst for Merkel's political career. Although she did not participate in the crowd celebrations the night the wall came down, one month later Merkel became involved in the growing democracy movement, joining the new party Democratic Awakening. Following the first (and only) multi-party election in East Germany, she became the deputy spokesperson of the new pre-unification caretaker government under Lothar de Maizi√®re. Merkel had impressed de Maiziere with her adept dealing with journalists questioning the role of a party leader, Wolfgang Schnur, as an \\"informal co-worker\\" with the homeland security services. In April 1990, Democratic Awakening merged with the East German Christian Democratic Union, which in turn merged with its western counterpart after reunification. In the German federal election of 1990, the first to be held following reunification, Merkel successfully stood for election to the Bundestag in the parliamentary constituency of Stralsund ‚Äì Nordvorpommern ‚Äì R√ºgen in north Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. She has won re-election from this constituency (renamed, with slightly adjusted borders, Vorpommern-R√ºgen ‚Äì Vorpommern-Greifswald I in 2003) at the seven federal elections held since then. Almost immediately following her entry into parliament, Merkel was appointed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to serve as Minister for Women and Youth in the federal cabinet. In 1994, she was promoted to the position of Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety, which gave her greater political visibility and a platform on which to build her personal political career. As one of Kohl's prot√©g√©es and his youngest Cabinet Minister, she was frequently referred to by Kohl as \\"mein M√§dchen\\" (\\"my girl\\"). =Leader of the opposition= After the Kohl Government was defeated at the 1998 election, Merkel was appointed Secretary-General of the CDU, a key position as the party was no longer part of the federal government. Merkel oversaw a string of CDU election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999, breaking the long-standing SPD-Green hold on the Bundesrat. Following a party funding scandal that compromised many leading figures of the CDU ‚Äì including Kohl himself and his successor as CDU Leader, Wolfgang Sch√§uble ‚Äì Merkel criticised her former mentor publicly and advocated a fresh start for the party without him. She was subsequently elected to replace Sch√§uble, becoming the first female leader of a German party on 10 April 2000. Her election surprised many observers, as her personality offered a contrast to the party she had been elected to lead; Merkel is a centrist Protestant originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, socially conservative party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep Catholic roots. Putin, 2002 Following Merkel's election as CDU Leader, the CDU was not able to win in subsequent state elections. As early as February 2001 her rival Friedrich Merz had made clear he intended to become Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der's main challenger in the 2002 election. Merkel's own ambition to become Chancellor was well-known, but she lacked the support of most Minister-presidents and other grandees within her own party. She was subsequently outmaneuvered politically by CSU Leader Edmund Stoiber, to whom she eventually ceded the privilege of challenging Schr√∂der.Barry Turner (ed.) The Statesman's Yearbook 2015: The Politics, Cultures and Economies of the World, Springer 2014 p. 516 He went on to squander a large lead in opinion polls to lose the election by a razor-thin margin in an election campaign that was dominated by the Iraq War. While Chancellor Schr√∂der made clear he would not join the war in Iraq,Schroeder wins second term CNN, 23 September 2002. Merkel and the CDU-CSU supported the invasion of Iraq. After Stoiber's defeat in 2002, in addition to her role as CDU Leader, Merkel became Leader of the Opposition in the Bundestag; Friedrich Merz, who had held the post prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel. Merkel supported a substantial reform agenda for Germany's economic and social system, and was considered more pro- market than her own party (the CDU). She advocated German labour law changes, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week. She argued that existing laws made the country less competitive, because companies could not easily control labour costs when business is slow. Merkel argued that Germany should phase out nuclear power less quickly than the Schr√∂der administration had planned. Merkel advocated a strong transatlantic partnership and German-American friendship. In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, Merkel came out in favour of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, describing it as \\"unavoidable\\" and accusing Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der of anti-Americanism. She criticised the government's support for the accession of Turkey to the European Union and favoured a \\"privileged partnership\\" instead. In doing so, she reflected public opinion that grew more hostile toward Turkish membership of the European Union.Marlies Casier and Joost Jongerden, eds. Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey (2010) p. 110  2005 national election  On 30 May 2005, Merkel won the CDU/CSU nomination as challenger to Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der of the SPD in the 2005 national elections. Her party began the campaign with a 21-point lead over the SPD in national opinion polls, although her personal popularity lagged behind that of the incumbent. However, the CDU/CSU campaign suffered when Merkel, having made economic competence central to the CDU's platform, confused gross and net income twice during a televised debate. She regained some momentum after she announced that she would appoint Paul Kirchhof, a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert, as Minister of Finance. Merkel and the CDU lost ground after Kirchhof proposed the introduction of a flat tax in Germany, again undermining the party's broad appeal on economic affairs and convincing many voters that the CDU's platform of deregulation was designed to benefit only the rich. This was compounded by Merkel's proposal to increase VAT to reduce Germany's deficit and fill the gap in revenue from a flat tax. The SPD were able to increase their support simply by pledging not to introduce flat taxes or increase VAT. Although Merkel's standing recovered after she distanced herself from Kirchhof's proposals, she remained considerably less popular than Schr√∂der, and the CDU's lead was down to 9% on the eve of the election. On the eve of the election, Merkel was still favored to win a decisive victory based on opinion polls. On 18 September 2005, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schr√∂der's SPD went head-to-head in the national elections, with the CDU/CSU winning 35.2% (CDU 27.8%/CSU 7.5%) of the second votes to the SPD's 34.2%. The result was so close, both Schr√∂der and Merkel claimed victory. Neither the SPD-Green coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party, held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag. A grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD faced the challenge that both parties demanded the chancellorship. However, after three weeks of negotiations, the two parties reached a deal whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet. Chancellor of Germany Merkel in 2007 On 22 November 2005, Merkel assumed the office of Chancellor of Germany following a stalemate election that resulted in a grand coalition with the SPD. The coalition deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November 2005. Merkel was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the governing coalition voted against her. Reports at the time indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differed from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing VAT (from 16 to 19%), social insurance contributions and the top rate of income tax. When announcing the coalition agreement, Merkel stated that the main aim of her government would be to reduce unemployment, and that it was this issue on which her government would be judged. Her party was re-elected in 2009 with an increased number of seats, and could form a governing coalition with the FDP. This term was overshadowed by the European debt crisis. Conscription in Germany was abolished and the Bundeswehr became a Volunteer military. Unemployment sank below the mark of 3 million unemployed people. In the election of September 2013 the CDU/CSU parties emerged as winners, but formed another grand coalition with the SPD due to the FDP's failure to obtain the minimum of 5% of votes required to enter parliament. In the 2017 election, Merkel led her party to victory for the fourth time. Both CDU/CSU and SPD received a significantly lower proportion of the vote than they did in the 2013 election, and attempted to form a coalition with the FDP and Greens. The collapse of these talks led to stalemate. The German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier subsequently appealed successfully to the SPD to change their hard stance and to agree a 3rd grand coalition with the CDU/CSU. =Domestic policy= Immigration, refugees and migration In October 2010, Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at Potsdam that attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany had \\"utterly failed\\", stating that: \\"The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it\\" does not work and \\"we feel attached to the Christian concept of mankind, that is what defines us. Anyone who doesn't accept that is in the wrong place here\\". She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany's culture and values. This has added to a growing debate within Germany on the levels of immigration, its effect on Germany and the degree to which Muslim immigrants have integrated into German society. Merkel is in favour of a \\"mandatory solidarity mechanism\\" for relocation of asylum-seekers from Italy and Greece to other EU member states as part of the long-term solution to Europe's migrants crisis. =2015 European migrant crisis= S√°nchez and Merkel in Andalusia, 2018 In late August 2015, Chancellor Merkel announced that Germany would also process asylum applications from Syrian refugees if they had come to Germany through other EU countries. That year, nearly 1.1 million asylum seekers entered Germany. Junior coalition partner, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said that Germany could take in 500,000 refugees annually for the next several years.\\"Migrant crisis: Germany 'can take 500,000 asylum seekers a year'\\". BBC News. 8 September 2015. German opposition to the government's admission of the new wave of migrants was strong and coupled with a rise in anti-immigration protests. Merkel insisted that Germany had the economic strength to cope with the influx of migrants and reiterated that there is no legal maximum limit on the number of migrants Germany can take. In September 2015, enthusiastic crowds across the country welcomed arriving refugees and migrants. Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU)the sister party of Merkel's Christian Democratic Unionand then-Bavarian Minister President, attacked Merkel's policies. Seehofer criticised Merkel's decision to allow in migrants, saying that \\"[they were] in a state of mind without rules, without system and without order because of a German decision.\\"\\"Viktor Orb√°n, Bavaria's hardline hero\\". Politico. 23 September 2015. Seehofer estimated as many as 30 percent of asylum seekers arriving in Germany claiming to be from Syria are in fact from other countries,\\"Refugee crisis: Many migrants falsely claim to be Syrians, Germany says as EU tries to ease tensions\\". The Daily Telegraph. 25 September 2015. and suggested reducing EU funding for member countries that rejected mandatory refugee quotas.\\"Berlin calls for sanctions on EU states that reject refugee quotas\\". Deutsche Welle. 15 September 2015. Meanwhile, Yasmin Fahimi, secretary-general of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the junior partner of the ruling coalition, praised Merkel's policy allowing migrants in Hungary to enter Germany as \\"a strong signal of humanity to show that Europe's values are valid also in difficult times\\". In November 2015, there were talks inside the governing coalition to stop family unification for migrants for two years, and to establish \\"Transit Zones\\" on the border and ‚Äì for migrants with low chances to get asylum approved ‚Äì to be housed there until their application is approved. The issues are in conflict between the CSU who favoured those new measures and threatened to leave the coalition without them, and the SPD who opposes them; Merkel agreed to the measures. The November 2015 Paris attacks prompted a reevaluation of German officials' stance on the EU's policy toward migrants. There appeared to be a consensus among officials, with the exception of Merkel, that a higher level of scrutiny was needed in vetting migrants with respect to their mission in Germany. However, while not officially limiting the influx numerically, Merkel tightened asylum policy in Germany. Migrants in Germany, October 2015 In October 2016, Merkel travelled to Mali and Niger. The diplomatic visit took place to discuss how their governments could improve conditions which caused people to flee those countries and how illegal migration through and from these countries could be reduced. The migrant crisis spurred right-wing electoral preferences across Germany with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) gaining 12% of the vote in the 2017 German federal election. These developments prompted debates over the reasons for increased right-wing populism in Germany. Literature argued that the increased right-wing preferences are a result of the European migrant crisis which has brought thousands of people, predominantly from Muslim countries to Germany, and spurred a perception among a share of Germans that refugees constitute an ethnic and cultural threat to Germany. =2018 asylum government crisis= In March 2018, the CSU's Horst Seehofer took over the role of Interior Minister. A policy Seehofer announced is that he has a \\"master plan for faster asylum procedures, and more consistent deportations.\\" Under Seehofer's plan, Germany would reject migrants who have already been deported or have an entry ban and would instruct police to turn away all migrants who have registered elsewhere in the EU, no matter if these countries agreed to take them back.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/germany-interior-minister-merkel- ultimatum- migrants-180618093627915.htmlhttps://www.telegraphindia.com/world/germany-s- interior-minister-horst-seehofer-wants-quick-action-on-migra-dgtl-238561 Merkel feared that unilaterally sending migrants back to neighbouring countries without seeking a multilateral European agreement could endanger the stability of the European Union. In June 2018, Seehofer backed down from a threat to bypass her in the disagreement over immigration policy until she would come back on July 1 from attempts to find a solution at the European level. On 1 July 2018, Seehofer rejected the agreement Merkel had obtained with EU countries as too little and declared his resignation during a meeting of his party's executive, but they refused to accept it.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/merkel-coalition-crisis-seehofer- offers-quit-migration-180702052457364.htmlhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world- europe-44674945https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/merkel-fights-to- save-coalition-from-division-over-migration During the night of 2 July 2018, Seehofer and Merkel announced they had settled their differences and agreed to instead accept a compromise of tighter border control.Germany‚Äôs Merkel Secures Deal on Migrants, Averts Government Collapse The Wall Street JournalNadine Schmidt and Judith Vonberg (2 July 2018). \\"Germany's Merkel makes deal with interior minister on migration dispute\\". CNN International Edition. edition.cnn.com. Retrieved 2018-07-03. As a result of the agreement, Seehofer agreed to not resign,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44685727 and to negotiate bilateral agreements with the specific countries himself. Seehofer was criticised for almost bringing the government down while the monthly number of migrants targeted by that policy was in single figures. Coronavirus pandemic On 6 April 2020, Merkel stated: \\"In my view... the European Union is facing the biggest test since its foundation and member states must show greater solidarity so that the bloc can emerge stronger from the economic crisis unleashed by the pandemic\\".Coronavirus pandemic is historical test for EU, Merkel says Merkel has won international plaudits for her handling of the pandemic in Germany. =Foreign policy= Merkel's foreign policy has focused on strengthening European cooperation and international trade agreements. Merkel has been widely described as the de facto leader of the European Union throughout her tenure as Chancellor. In 2015, with the absence of Stephen Harper, Merkel became the only leader to have attended every G20 meeting since the very first in 2008, having been present at a record fourteen summits as of 2019. She hosted the twelfth meeting at the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit. United States One of Merkel's priorities was strengthening transatlantic economic relations. She signed the agreement for the Transatlantic Economic Council on 30 April 2007 at the White House. Merkel enjoyed good relations with U.S. Presidents George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Obama described her in 2016 as his \\"closest international partner\\" throughout his tenure as president. Obama's farewell visit to Berlin in November 2016 was widely interpreted as the passing of the torch of global liberal leadership to Merkel as Merkel was seen by many as the new standard bearer of liberal democracy since the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president.http://news.sky.com/story/has-baton-of-global-leadership-passed- from-us-to-germany-10661050http://www.france24.com/en/20161117-usa-germany- obama-passes-torch-merkel-farewell-tour Upon the election of Donald Trump Merkel said that \\"Germany and America are tied by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and human dignity, independent of origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views. I offer the next president of the United States, Donald Trump, close cooperation on the basis of these values.\\" The comment was interpreted as reintegrative shaming. Following the G7 Summit in Italy and the NATO Summit in Brussels, Merkel stated on May 28, 2017 that the US was no longer the reliable partner Europe and Germany had depended on in the past. At an electoral rally in Munich, she said that \\"We have to know that we must fight for our future on our own, for our destiny as Europeans\\", which has been interpreted as an unprecedented shift in the German-American transatlantic relationship. China On 25 September 2007, Merkel met the 14th Dalai Lama for \\"private and informal talks\\" in the Chancellery in Berlin amid protest from China. China afterwards cancelled separate talks with German officials, including talks with Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries. In recognition of the importance of China to the German economy, by 2014 Merkel had led seven trade delegations to China since assuming office in 2005. The same year, in March, China's President Xi Jinping visited Germany. In response to the death of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died of organ failure while in government custody, Merkel said in a statement that Liu had been a \\"courageous fighter for civil rights and freedom of expression.\\" In July 2019, the UN ambassadors from 22 nations, including Germany, signed a joint letter to the UNHRC condemning China's mistreatment of the Uyghurs as well as its mistreatment of other minority groups, urging the Chinese government to close the Xinjiang re- education camps. Russia Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, May 2017 In 2006, Merkel expressed concern about overreliance on Russian energy, but she received little support from others in Berlin. In June 2017, Merkel criticized the draft of new U.S. sanctions against Russia that target EU‚ÄìRussia energy projects, including Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.\\"Germany's Angela Merkel slams planned U.S. sanctions on Russia\\". Deutsche Welle. 16 June 2017. Other issues Merkel favors the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union; but stated in December 2012 that its implementation depends on reforms in Ukraine. Merkel expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. She telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 9 July to condemn \\"without reservation rocket fire on Israel\\". In June 2018, Merkel said that there had been \\"no moral or political justification\\" for the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from Central and Eastern European countries. = Eurozone crisis = Tusk, Italian PM Berlusconi, and Merkel, 2008 Merkel at the 2012 congress of the European People's Party (EPP) During the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, the German government stepped in to assist the mortgage company Hypo Real Estate with a bailout, which was agreed on 6 October, with German banks to contribute ‚Ç¨30 billion and the Bundesbank ‚Ç¨20 billion to a credit line. On 4 October 2008, following the Irish Government's decision to guarantee all deposits in private savings accounts, a move she strongly criticised, Merkel said there were no plans for the German Government to do the same. The following day, Merkel stated that the government would guarantee private savings account deposits, after all. However, two days later, on 6 October 2008, it emerged that the pledge was simply a political move that would not be backed by legislation. Other European governments eventually either raised the limits or promised to guarantee savings in full. =Social expenditure= At the World Economic Forum in Davos, 2013, she said that Europe had only 7% of the global population and produced only 25% of the global GDP, but that it accounted for almost 50% of global social expenditure. She went on to say that Europe could only maintain its prosperity by being innovative and measuring itself against the best. Since then, this comparison has become a central element in major speeches.Among others, in her speech on the occasion of her honorary doctoral degree at the University of Szeged in Hungary, see http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Rede/2015/02/2015-02-02-merkel- budapest.html. The international financial press has widely commented on her thesis, with The Economist saying that: adding that: The Financial Times commented: =Cabinets= Merkel at the signing of the coalition agreement for the 18th election period of the Bundestag, December 2013 The first cabinet of Angela Merkel was sworn in at 16:00 CET on 22 November 2005. On 31 October 2005, after the defeat of his favoured candidate for the position of Secretary General of the SPD, Franz M√ºntefering indicated that he would resign as party chairman, which he did in November. Ostensibly responding to this, Edmund Stoiber (CSU), who was originally nominated as Minister for Economics and Technology, announced his withdrawal on 1 November 2005. While this was initially seen as a blow to Merkel's attempt at forming a viable coalition, the manner in which Stoiber withdrew earned him much ridicule and severely undermined his position as a Merkel rival. Separate conferences of the CDU, CSU, and SPD approved the proposed Cabinet on 14 November 2005. The second Cabinet of Angela Merkel was sworn in on 28 October 2009. In 2013, Merkel won one of the most decisive victories in German history, achieving the best result for the CDU/CSU since reunification and coming within five seats of the first absolute majority in the Bundestag since 1957. However, with their preferred coalition partner, the FDP, failing to enter parliament for the first time since 1949, the CDU/CSU turned to the SPD to form the third grand coalition in postwar German history and the second under Merkel's leadership. The third Cabinet of Angela Merkel was sworn in on 17 December 2013. The fourth cabinet of Angela Merkel is the current government of Germany, and was sworn in on 14 March 2018 after. The negotiations that led to a Grand Coalition agreement with the Social Democracts (SPD) were the longest in German post-war history, lasting almost six months. =Approval ratings= Midway through her second term, Merkel's approval plummeted in Germany, resulting in heavy losses in state elections for her party. An August 2011 poll found her coalition had only 36% support compared to a rival potential coalition's 51%. However, she scored well on her handling of the recent euro crisis (69% rated her performance as good rather than poor), and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77% in February 2012 and again in July 2014. Merkel's approval rating dropped to 54% in October 2015, during the European migrant crisis, the lowest since 2011.\\"Merkel Approval Rating Drops to Four-Year Low on Refugee Crisis\\". Bloomberg. 2 October 2015, According to a poll conducted after terror attacks in Germany Merkel's approval rating dropped to 47% (August 2016). Half of Germans did not want her to serve a fourth term in office compared to 42% in favor. However, according to a poll taken in October 2016, her approval rating had been found to have risen again, 54% of Germans were found to be satisfied with work of Merkel as Chancellor. According to another poll taken in November 2016, 59% were to found to be in favour of a renewed Chancellor candidature of Merkel in 2017. According to a poll carried out just days after the 2016 Berlin truck attack, in which it was asked which political leader(s) Germans trust to solve their country's problems; 56% named Merkel, 39% Seehofer (CSU), 35% Gabriel (SPD), 32% Schulz (SPD), 25% √ñzdemir (Greens), 20% Wagenknecht (Left Party), 15% Lindner (FDP), and just 10% for Petry (AfD). A YouGov survey published in late December 2017 found that just 36 percent of all respondents wanted Merkel to stay at the helm until 2021, while half of those surveyed voters called for a change at the top before the end of the legislature. By 2019 this had again changed, with now 67% of Germans wanting Merkel to stay till the end of her term in 2021 and only 29% wanting her to step down earlier. =International status= Poroshenko, Merkel, and American Vice President Biden, 7 February 2015 Merkel has been widely described as the de facto leader of the European Union throughout her tenure as Chancellor. Merkel has twice been named the world's second most powerful person following Vladimir Putin by Forbes magazine, the highest ranking ever achieved by a woman. On 26 March 2014, Merkel became the longest-serving incumbent head of government in the European Union. In December 2015, Merkel was named as Time magazine's Person of the Year, with the magazine's cover declaring her to be the \\"Chancellor of the Free World\\". In 2018, Merkel was named the most powerful woman in the world for a record fourteenth time by Forbes. Following the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency in November 2016, Merkel was described by The New York Times as \\"the Liberal West's Last Defender\\". Since 2016 she has been described by some commentators as the \\"leader of the free world\\". Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described Merkel in 2017 as \\"the most important leader in the free world\\", She is currently the senior G7 leader. The Atlantic described her in 2019 as \\"the world's most successful living politician, on the basis of both achievement and longevity\\". She was found in a 2018 survey to be the most respected world leader internationally. She was named as Harvard University's commencement speaker in 2019; Harvard University President Larry Bacow described her as \\"one of the most widely admired and broadly influential statespeople of our time\\". Views both domestic and abroad have often been divisive and critical however, particularly of her migrant policies and attitude towards NATO contributions. = Succession = Macri in the Casa Rosada, 2017 On 29 October 2018, Merkel announced that she would not seek reelection as leader of CDU at their party conference in December 2018, but intended to remain as chancellor until 2021, when the next German federal election, at the latest, is to be held. She stated that she does not plan to seek any political office after this. The resignations followed October setbacks for the CSU in the Bavarian state election and for the CDU in the Hessian state election. In August 2019, Merkel hinted that she might return to academia at the end of her term in 2021. She decided not to suggest any person as her successor as leader of the CDU. However, political observers had long considered Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as Merkel's prot√©g√© groomed for succession. This view was confirmed when Kramp-Karrenbauer ‚Äì widely seen as the chancellor's favourite for the post ‚Äì was voted to succeed Merkel as leader of the CDU in December 2018. Kramp-Karrenbauer's elevation to Defence Minister after Ursula von der Leyen's departure to become president of the European Commission also boosted her standing as Merkel's most likely candidate for succession. In 2019, media outlets speculated that Kramp- Karrenbauer may take over Merkel's position as Chancellor sooner than planned if the current governing coalition proved unsustainable. The possibility was neither confirmed nor denied by the party. In February 2020, Kramp-Karrenbauer announced that she would resign as party leader of the CDU in the summer, after party members in Thuringia defied her by voting with Alternative for Germany to support a FDP-candidate for minister-president. Personal life Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Merkel, and her husband Joachim Sauer, 2009 In 1977, at the age of 23, Merkel, then Angela Kasner, married physics student Ulrich Merkel (born 1953) and took his surname. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Her second and current husband is quantum chemist and professor Joachim Sauer, who has largely remained out of the media spotlight. They first met in 1981, became a couple later and married privately on 30 December 1998. She has no children, but Sauer has two adult sons from a previous marriage. Merkel is a fervent football fan and has been known to listen to games while in the Bundestag and to attend games of the national team in her official capacity. Merkel stated that her favorite movie is The Legend of Paul and Paula, an East German movie released in 1973. Merkel has a fear of dogs after being attacked by one in 1995. Vladimir Putin, in a move reminiscent of Germany's first chancellor Otto von Bismarck and his Reichshunde, brought in his Labrador Retriever during a press conference in 2007. Putin claims he did not mean to scare her, though Merkel later observed, \\"I understand why he has to do this ‚Äì to prove he's a man. ... He's afraid of his own weakness.\\" Since 2017 Merkel has been seen and filmed to shake visibly on several public occasions, recovering shortly afterwards. After one such occasion she attributed the shaking to dehydration, saying that she felt better after a drink of water. After three occasions where this happened in June 2019, she began to sit down during the performances of the national anthems during the State visits of Mette Frederiksen and Maia Sandu the following month. =Religion= Merkel speaking at the 2011 German Evangelical Church Assembly in Dresden. Angela Merkel is a Lutheran member of the Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia (), a United Protestant (i.e. both Reformed and Lutheran) church body under the umbrella of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). The EKBO is a church of the Union of Evangelical Churches. Before the 2004 merger of the Evangelical Church in Berlin- Brandenburg and the Evangelical Church in Silesian Upper Lusatia (both also being a part of the EKD), she belonged to the former. In 2012, Merkel said, regarding her faith: \\"I am a member of the evangelical church. I believe in God and religion is also my constant companion, and has been for the whole of my life. We as Christians should above all not be afraid of standing up for our beliefs.\\" She also publicly declared that Germany suffers not from \\"too much Islam\\" but \\"too little Christianity\\".

Comparisons Merkel, often depicted as the unofficial leader of Europe, at the 2019 G20 Osaka summit As a female politician from a centre- right party who is also a scientist, Merkel has been compared by many in the English-language press to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Thatcher also had a science degree from Oxford University in chemistry). Some have referred to her as \\"Iron Lady\\", \\"Iron Girl\\", and even \\"The Iron Frau\\", all alluding to Thatcher, whose nickname was \\"The Iron Lady\\". Political commentators have debated the precise extent to which their agendas are similar. Later in her tenure, Merkel acquired the nickname \\"Mutti\\" (a German familiar form of \\"mother\\"). She has also been called the \\"Iron Chancellor\\", in reference to Otto von Bismarck. In addition to being the first female German chancellor, the first to have grown up in the former East Germany (though she was born in the West), and the youngest German chancellor since the Second World War, Merkel is also the first born after World War II, and the first chancellor of the Federal Republic with a background in natural sciences. While she studied physics, her predecessors studied law, business or history, among other professions. Controversies The decisions of Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015 on migration policies have led to much discussion and commotion, in the whole Western world Merkel has been criticised for being personally present and involved at the M100 Media Award handover to Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who had triggered the Muhammad cartoons controversy. This happened at a time of fierce emotional debate in Germany over a book by the former Deutsche Bundesbank executive and finance senator of Berlin Thilo Sarrazin, which was critical of the Muslim immigration. At the same time she condemned a planned burning of Qurans by a fundamental pastor in Florida. The Central Council of Muslims in GermanyBBC: Germany's Central Muslim Council (Zentralrat der Muslime in Deutschland) criticised Mrs. Merkel for attending the award ceremony. 8 September 2010. A ZMD spokesman, Aiman Mazyek, told public broadcaster Deutschlandradio that the Chancellor was honouring someone \\"who in our eyes kicked our prophet, and therefore kicked all Muslims\\". He said giving Mr Westergaard the prize in a \\"highly charged and heated time\\" was \\"highly problematic\\". and the Left Party (Die Linke) as well as the German Green Party criticised the action by the centre-right chancellor. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper wrote: \\"This will probably be the most explosive moment of her chancellorship so far.\\" Others have praised Merkel and called it a brave and bold move for the cause of freedom of speech. Merkel's position towards the negative statements by Thilo Sarrazin with regard to the integration problems with Arab and Turkish people in Germany has been critical throughout. According to her personal statements, Sarrazin's approach is \\"totally unacceptable\\" and counterproductive to the ongoing problems of integration. The term alternativlos (German for \\"without an alternative\\"), which was frequently used by Angela Merkel to describe her measures addressing the European sovereign-debt crisis, was named the Un-word of the Year 2010 by a jury of linguistic scholars. The wording was criticised as undemocratic, as any discussion on Merkel's politics would thus be deemed unnecessary or undesirable. The expression is credited for the name of the political party Alternative for Germany, which was founded in 2013. NSA's mass surveillance, Berlin, June 2013 In July 2013, Merkel defended the surveillance practices of the National Security Agency, and described the United States as \\"our truest ally throughout the decades\\". During a visit of U.S. President Barack Obama in Berlin, Merkel said on 19 June 2013 in the context of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures: \\"The Internet is uncharted territory for us all\\" (). This statement led to various internet memes and online mockery of Merkel. Merkel compared the NSA to the Stasi when it became known that her mobile phone was tapped by that agency. In response, Susan Rice pledged that the U.S. will desist from spying on her personally, but said there would not be a no-espionage agreement between the two countries. BND has covertly monitored European firms and officials at the request of the NSA.\\"Merkel defends German intelligence cooperation with NSA\\". Reuters. 4 May 2015. In July 2014 Merkel said trust between Germany and the United States could only be restored by talks between the two, and she would seek to have talks. She reiterated the U.S. remained Germany's most important ally. Her statement \\"Islam is part of Germany\\" during a state visit of the Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu in January 2015\\"Geh√∂rt der Islam zu Deutschland? Kauder widerspricht Merkel\\", Idea, 19 January 2015 induced criticism within her party. The parliamentary group leader Volker Kauder said that Islam is not part of Germany and that Muslims should deliberate on the question why so many violent people refer to the Quran. In October 2015, Horst Seehofer, Bavarian State Premier and leader of CSU, the sister party of Merkel's CDU, criticised Merkel's policy of allowing in hundreds of thousands of migrants from the Middle East: \\"We're now in a state of mind without rules, without system and without order because of a German decision.\\" Seehofer attacked Merkel policies in sharp language, threatened to sue the government in the high court, and hinted that the CSU might topple Merkel. Many MPs of Merkel's CDU party also voiced dissatisfaction with Merkel. Chancellor Merkel insisted that Germany has the economic strength to cope with the influx of migrants and reiterated that there is no legal maximum limit on the number of migrants Germany can take. At the conclusion of the May 2017 Group of Seven's leaders in Sicily, Merkel criticised American efforts to renege on earlier commitments on climate change. According to Merkel, the discussions were difficult and marred by dissent. \\"Here we have the situation where six members, or even seven if you want to add the EU, stand against one.\\" Merkel has faced criticism for failing to take a tough line on Communist China. The Asia Times reported that \\"Unlike certain of her European counterparts, her China diplomacy has focused on non- interference in Beijing‚Äôs internal affairs. As such, Merkel was reportedly furious when her Foreign Minister Heiko Maas received Hong Kong dissident Joshua Wong in Berlin in September [2019], a move that Beijing publicly protested.\\" In the arts and media Since 1991, Merkel has sat annually for sitting and standing portraits by, and interview with, Herlinde Koelbl. Merkel was portrayed by Swiss actress Anna Katarina in the 2012 political satire film The Dictator. Merkel features as a main character in two of the three plays that make up the Europeans Trilogy (Bruges, Antwerp, Tervuren) by Paris-based UK playwright Nick Awde: Bruges (Edinburgh Festival, 2014) and Tervuren (2016). A character named Merkel, accompanied by a sidekick called Sch√§uble, also appears as the sinister female henchman in Michael Paraskos's novel In Search of Sixpence.Paraskos, Michael, In Search of Sixpence (London: Friction Press, 2016). On the American sketch-comedy Saturday Night Live, she has been parodied by Kate McKinnon since 2013. On the British sketch-comedy Tracey Ullman's Show, comedian Tracey Ullman has parodied Merkel to international acclaim with German media dubbing her impersonation as the best spoof of Merkel in the world.\\"True total hottie Frau\\": Die bislang beste Merkel ‚Äì Parodie kommt von der BBC, Buzzer, 21 January 2016. In 2016, a documentary film Angela Merkel ‚Äì The Unexpected, a story about her unexpected rise to power from an East German physicist to the most powerful woman in the world, was produced by Broadview TV and MDR in collaboration with Arte and Das Erste.

Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, salivary, mammary, ceruminous, lacrimal, sebaceous, prostate and mucous. Exocrine glands are one of two types of glands in the human body, the other being endocrine glands, which secrete their products directly into the bloodstream. The liver and pancreas are both exocrine and endocrine glands; they are exocrine glands because they secrete products‚Äîbile and pancreatic juice‚Äîinto the gastrointestinal tract through a series of ducts, and endocrine because they secrete other substances directly into the bloodstream. Classification = Structure= Exocrine glands contain a glandular portion and a duct portion, the structures of which can be used to classify the gland. * The duct portion may be branched (called compound) or unbranched (called simple). * The glandular portion may be tubular or acinar, or may be a mix of the two (called tubuloacinar). If the glandular portion branches, then the gland is called a branched gland. =Method of secretion= Exocrine glands are named apocrine glands, holocrine glands, or merocrine glands based on how their products are secreted. * Merocrine secretion ‚Äì cells excrete their substances by exocytosis; for example, pancreatic acinar cells. * Apocrine secretion ‚Äì a portion of the cell membrane that contains the excretion buds off. * Holocrine secretion ‚Äì the entire cell disintegrates to excrete its substance; for example, sebaceous glands of the skin and nose. = Product secreted= * Serous cells secrete proteins, often enzymes. Examples include gastric chief cells and Paneth cells * Mucous cells secrete mucus. Examples include Brunner's glands, esophageal glands, and pyloric glands * Mixed glands secrete both protein and mucus. Examples include the salivary glands: although the parotid gland 20%is predominantly serous, the sublingual gland 5% mainly mucous gland, and the submandibular gland 70%is a mixed, mainly serous gland. * Sebaceous glands secrete sebum, a lipid product. These glands are also known as oil glands, e.g. Fordyce spots and Meibomian glands. Additional images File:Gray1033.pngSection of the human esophagus.

The falls are located on the High Rhine on the border between the cantons of Schaffhausen (SH) and Z√ºrich (ZH), between the municipalities of Neuhausen am Rheinfall (SH) and Laufen-Uhwiesen/Dachsen (ZH), next to the town of Schaffhausen in northern Switzerland. They are wide and high. In the winter months, the average water flow is , while in the summer, the average water flow is . The highest flow ever measured was in 1965; and the lowest, in 1921. The falls cannot be climbed by fish, except by eels that are able to worm their way up over the rocks. Geology The Rhine Falls seen from the Rhine The Rhine Falls were formed in the last ice age, approximately 14,000 to 17,000 years ago, by erosion-resistant rocks narrowing the riverbed. The first glacial advances created today's landforms approximately 500,000 years ago. Up to the end of the Wolstonian Stage approximately 132,000 years ago, the Rhine flowed westwards from Schaffhausen past Klettgau. This earlier riverbed later filled up with gravel. About 132,000 years ago the course of the river changed southwards at Schaffhausen and formed a new channel, which also filled up with gravel. Part of the Rhine today includes this ancient riverbed. During the W√ºrm glaciation, the Rhine was pushed far to the south to its present course, over a hard Late Jurassic limestone bed. As the river flowed over both the hard limestone and the easily eroded gravel from previous glaciations, the current waterfall formed about 14,000 to 17,000 years ago. The Rheinfallfelsen, a large rock, is the remnant of the original limestone cliff flanking the former channel. The rock has eroded very little over the years because relatively little sediment comes down the Rhine from Lake Constance. Economics The north side of the falls is a millsite. In the 17th century, a blast furnace for smelting iron ore found in the limestone was built. It was in operation until the first half of the 19th century. In 1887 the ironworks applied for permission to divert between one fifth to one half of the river's flow for electricity generation. The Swiss Alpine Club, the Schweizerische Naturforschende Gesellschaft (a nature group) and several scientific societies opposed the plan. In 1913 an international competition was held for the best plan for a shipping route between Basel and Lake Constance. In 1919, a company wanting to build power stations in northern Switzerland were told that any such station at the Rhine Falls \\"must serve the economic interest of the public\\".Uehlinger, A. (1941): Die Naturschutzbestrebungen am Rheinfall. In: Schweizer Naturschutz 7:95‚Äì102. In 1944, the Swiss Council of States granted permission to build the proposed power station. The permission was to become effective on 1 February 1948, with construction to begin in 1952. But in 1951, the Neuen Helvetischen Gesellschaft (New Swiss Society), under the leadership of Emil Egli, got 150,000 Swiss citizens to sign a petition protesting the project; among the signatories were 49 famous citizens, including Hermann Hesse and Carl Jacob Burckhardt. The petition not only scuttled the power station project, but effectively prevented all future hydropower and navigation engineering projects on the upper Rhine to the present day.Alfred Barthelme√ü (1988): Landschaft-Lebensraum des Menschen S. 165 ff. Verlag Alber. Today, the falls are still under consideration for hydropower projects. If the full water flow were used, the power generated would average approximately 50 MW. The economic value of the falls as a tourist attraction may be greater. Tourism The nearest community is Neuhausen am Rheinfall, where tourists can also view the W√∂rth Castle.http://www.planetware.com/schaffhausen/rhine-falls-schloss-worth- ch-sh-sw.htm Boat trips can be taken up the Rhine to the falls and the Rheinfallfelsen. There are also viewing platforms with views of the falls built on both sides of the Rhine. These are reached via steep and narrow stairs (access by fee on the Schloss Laufen side). Guided tours of various lengths start from Schloss Laufen on the Z√ºrich side of the falls ‚Äì a youth hostel is also located in Schloss Laufen. Various restaurants are located in Schloss Laufen, Schloss W√∂rth and the Rheinfall park. The Rhine Falls are easily accessible by car, bicycle and public transport (SBB railway station \\"Neuhausen am Rheinfall\\" on the northern side of the falls and SBB railway station \\"Schloss Laufen am Rheinfall\\" on the southern banks of the river). Large pay-parking lots are located on both sides of the falls. Tourists have been awed by the Rhine Falls for centuries. In the 19th century, the painter J. M. W. Turner made several studies and larger paintings of the falls,Turner painting at nationalgalleries.org and the lyrical poet Eduard M√∂rike wrote of the falls: :Halte dein Herz, o Wanderer, fest in gewaltigen H√§nden! : Mir entst√ºrzte vor Lust zitternd das meinige fast. :Rastlos donnernde Massen auf donnernde Massen geworfen, : Ohr und Auge, wohin retten sie sich im Tumult? :(Hold your heart, oh traveller, tightly in mighty hands! :Mine nearly collapsed, shivering with pleasure. :Restlessly thundering masses thrown upon thundering masses, :Ear and eye, whither can they save themselves in such an uproar?) In 1840, author Mary Shelley visited the Falls while on a tour of Europe with her son. She described her visit in a travel narrative that she published in 1844, Rambles in Germany and Italy. She says: \\"A portion of the cataract arches over the lowest platform, and the spray fell thickly on us, as standing on it and looking up, we saw wave, and rock, and cloud, and the clear heavens through its glittering ever-moving veil. This was a new sight, exceeding anything I had ever before seen; however, not to be wet through, I was obliged quickly to tear myself away.\\".

On a few occasions, he also played the clarinet and piccolo. Dolphy was one of several multi- instrumentalists to gain prominence around the time that he was active. His use of the bass clarinet helped to establish the instrument within jazz. Dolphy extended the vocabulary and boundaries of the alto saxophone, and was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists. His improvisational style was characterized by the use of wide intervals, in addition to employing an array of extended techniques to emulate the sounds of human voices and animals. He used melodic lines that were \\"angular, zigzagging from interval to interval, taking hairpin turns at unexpected junctures, making dramatic leaps from the lower to the upper register.\\" Although Dolphy's work is sometimes classified as free jazz, his compositions and solos were often rooted in conventional (if highly abstracted) tonal bebop harmony. Early life, family and education Dolphy was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. His parents were Eric Dolphy, Sr. and Sadie Gillings, who immigrated to the United States from Panama. He began music lessons at age six, studying clarinet and saxophone privately. While still in junior high, he began to study the oboe, aspiring to a professional symphonic career, and received a two-year scholarship to study at the music school of the University of Southern California. At age thirteen he received a \\"Superior\\" award on clarinet from the California School Band and Orchestra festival. He attended Dorsey High School, where he continued his musical studies and learned additional instruments. By 1946, he was co-director of the Youth Choir at the Westminster Presbyterian Church run by Reverend Hampton B. Hawes, father of the jazz pianist. He graduated in 1947, then attended Los Angeles City College, during which time he played contemporary classical works such as Stravinsky's L'Histoire du soldat and, along with Jimmy Knepper and Art Farmer, performed with Roy Porter's 17 Beboppers, He went on to make eight recordings with Porter by 1949. On these early sessions, he occasionally played baritone saxophone, as well as alto saxophone, flute and soprano clarinet. Dolphy entered the U.S. Army in 1950 and was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington. Beginning in 1952, he attended the Navy School of Music. Following his discharge in 1953, he returned to L.A., where he worked with many musicians, including Buddy Collette, Eddie Beal, and Gerald Wilson, to whom he later dedicated the tune \\"G.W.\\", recorded on Outward Bound. Dolphy often had friends come by to jam, enabled by the fact that his father had built a studio for him in the family's backyard. Recordings made in 1954 with Clifford Brown document this early period. Career Dolphy received his big break when he was invited to join Chico Hamilton's quintet in 1958. With the group he became known to a wider audience and was able to tour extensively through 1958‚Äì59, when he parted ways with Hamilton and moved to New York City. Dolphy appears with Hamilton's band in the film Jazz on a Summer's Day playing flute during the Newport Jazz Festival of 1958. =Partnerships= Charles Mingus Charles Mingus had known Dolphy from growing up in Los Angeles, and the younger man joined Mingus' Jazz Workshop in 1960, shortly after arriving in New York. He took part in Mingus' big band recording Pre-Bird (later re- released as Mingus Revisited), and is featured on \\"Bemoanable Lady\\". Later he joined Mingus' working band which also included Ted Curson at the time. They worked at the Showplace during 1960 (memorialized in the poem \\"Mingus at the Showplace\\" by William Matthews), and recorded two albums together, Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus and Mingus at Antibes, the latter featuring Booker Ervin on almost all tracks and Bud Powell guesting on \\"I'll Remember April\\". Dolphy, Mingus said, \\"was a complete musician. He could fit anywhere. He was a fine lead alto in a big band. He could make it in a classical group. And, of course, he was entirely his own man when he soloed.... He had mastered jazz. And he had mastered all the instruments he played. In fact, he knew more than was supposed to be possible to do on them.\\" During this time, Dolphy participated in other recording sessions with Mingus for the Candid label and took part in the Newport Rebels session. In 1961, Dolphy left Mingus' band and went to Europe for a few months, where he was recorded in Scandinavia and Berlin. (See Berlin Concerts, The Complete Uppsala Concert, Eric Dolphy in Europe Volumes 1, 2, and 3 (1 and 3 were also released as Copenhagen Concert), and Stockholm Sessions.) He was later among the musicians who worked on Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus in 1963, and is featured on \\"Hora Decubitus\\". In early 1964, he joined Mingus' working band again, along with Jaki Byard, Johnny Coles, and Clifford Jordan. This sextet worked at the Five Spot before playing at Cornell University and Town Hall in New York (both were recorded: Cornell 1964 and Town Hall Concert) and subsequently touring Europe. The tour, although short, is well-documented on Revenge!, The Great Concert of Charles Mingus, Mingus in Europe Volume I, and Mingus in Europe Volume II. John Coltrane Dolphy and John Coltrane knew each other long before they formally played together, having met when Coltrane was in Los Angeles with Johnny Hodges in 1954. They would often exchange ideas and learn from each other, and eventually, after many nights sitting in with Coltrane's band, Dolphy was asked to become a full member in early 1961. Coltrane had gained an audience and critical notice with Miles Davis's quintet, but alienated some jazz critics when he began to move away from hard bop. Although Coltrane's quintets with Dolphy (including the Village Vanguard and Africa/Brass sessions) are now well regarded, they originally provoked Down Beat magazine to brand Coltrane and Dolphy's music as 'anti-jazz'. Coltrane later said of this criticism: \\"they made it appear that we didn't even know the first thing about music (...) it hurt me to see [Dolphy] get hurt in this thing.\\" The initial release of Coltrane's residency at the Vanguard selected three tracks, only one of which featured Dolphy. After being issued haphazardly over the next 30 years, a comprehensive box set featuring all of the recorded music from the Vanguard was released on Impulse! in 1997, called The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings. The set features Dolphy heavily on both alto saxophone and bass clarinet, with Eric the featured soloist on their renditions of \\"Naima\\". A 2001 Pablo box set drawing on recordings of Coltrane's performances from his European tours of the early 1960s feature tunes absent from releases of the 1961 Village Vanguard material, such as \\"My Favorite Things\\", which Dolphy performs on flute. Booker Little Before trumpeter Booker Little died at the age of 23, he and Dolphy had a short-lived musical partnership. Little's leader date for Candid, Out Front, featured Dolphy mainly on alto, though he played bass clarinet and flute on some ensemble passages. In addition, Dolphy's album Far Cry, recorded for Prestige, features Little on five tunes (one of which, \\"Serene\\", was not included on the original LP release). Dolphy and Little also co-led a quintet at the Five Spot during 1961. The rhythm section consisted of Richard Davis, Mal Waldron and Ed Blackwell. One night was documented and has been released on three volumes of At the Five Spot as well as the compilation Here and There. In addition, both Dolphy and Little backed Abbey Lincoln on her album Straight Ahead and played on Max Roach's Percussion Bitter Sweet. Others Dolphy also performed in key recordings by George Russell (Ezz-thetics), Oliver Nelson (Screamin' the Blues, The Blues and the Abstract Truth, and Straight Ahead), and Ornette Coleman (Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation and the Free Jazz outtake on Twins). He also worked and recorded with Gunther Schuller (Jazz Abstractions), multi-instrumentalist Ken McIntyre (Looking Ahead), and bassist Ron Carter (Where?). =As a leader= Dolphy's recording career as a leader began with Prestige. His association with the label spanned 13 albums recorded from April 1960 to September 1961, though he was not the leader for all of the sessions. Fantasy released a 9-CD box set in 1995 containing all of Dolphy's recorded output for Prestige. Dolphy's first two albums as leader were Outward Bound and Out There; both featured cover artwork by Richard \\"Prophet\\" Jennings. The first, sounding closer to hard bop than some later releases, was recorded at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in New Jersey with trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, who shared rooms with Dolphy for a time when they both first arrived in New York. The album features three Dolphy compositions: \\"G.W.\\", dedicated to Gerald Wilson, and the blues \\"Les\\" and \\"245\\". Out There is closer to third stream music, which would also form part of Dolphy's work, and features Ron Carter on cello. Charles Mingus's \\"Eclipse\\" from this album is one of the rare instances where Dolphy solos on soprano clarinet (others being \\"Warm Canto\\" from Mal Waldron's The Quest, \\"Densities\\" from the compilation Vintage Dolphy, and \\"Song For The Ram's Horn\\" from an unreleased recording from a 1962 Town Hall concert). Dolphy occasionally recorded unaccompanied saxophone solos; his only predecessors were the tenor players Coleman Hawkins (most notably \\"Picasso\\", 1948) and Sonny Rollins (for example \\"Body and Soul\\", 1958), making Dolphy the first to do so on alto. The album Far Cry contains his performance of the Gross-Lawrence standard \\"Tenderly\\" on alto saxophone, and, on his subsequent tour of Europe, Billie Holiday's \\"God Bless the Child\\" was featured in his sets. (The earliest known version was recorded at the Five Spot during his residency with Booker Little.) He also recorded two takes of a short solo rendition of \\"Love Me\\" in 1963, released on Conversations and Muses. Twentieth-century classical music was also part of Dolphy's musical career. He was very familiar with the music of composers such as Anton Webern and Alban Berg, and had a large record collection that included music by these composers, as well as by Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky, and Bart√≥k. He performed Edgard Var√®se's Density 21.5 for solo flute at the Ojai Music Festival in 1962, and participated in Gunther Schuller's and John Lewis's Third Stream efforts of the 1960s. Dolphy also admired the Italian flute virtuoso Severino Gazzelloni, after whom he named his composition Gazzelloni. Around 1962‚Äì63, one of Dolphy's working bands included the pianist Herbie Hancock, who can be heard on The Illinois Concert, Gaslight 1962, and the unissued Town Hall concert with poet Ree Dragonette. In July 1963, producer Alan Douglas arranged recording sessions for which Dolphy's sidemen were emerging musicians of the day, and the results produced the albums Iron Man and Conversations, as well as the Muses album released in Japan in late 2013. These sessions marked the first time Dolphy played with Bobby Hutcherson, whom he knew from Los Angeles, and whose sister he dated at one point. The sessions are perhaps most famous for the three duets Dolphy performs with bassist Richard Davis on \\"Alone Together\\", \\"Ode To Charlie Parker\\", and \\"Come Sunday\\"; the aforementioned release Muses adds another take of \\"Alone Together\\" and an original composition for duet from which the album takes its name. In 1964, Dolphy signed with Blue Note and recorded Out to Lunch! with Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Richard Davis and Tony Williams. This album features Dolphy's fully developed avant-garde yet structured compositional style rooted in tradition. It is often considered his magnum opus. = European career = After Out to Lunch! and an appearance on pianist/composer Andrew Hill's Blue Note album Point of Departure, Dolphy left for Europe with Charles Mingus' sextet in early 1964. Before a concert in Oslo, he informed Mingus that he planned to stay in Europe after their tour was finished, partly because he had become disillusioned with the United States' reception to musicians who were trying something new. Mingus then named the blues they had been performing \\"So Long Eric\\". Dolphy intended to settle in Europe with his fianc√©e Joyce Mordecai, who was working in the ballet scene in Paris. After leaving Mingus, he performed and recorded a few sides with various European bands, and American musicians living in Paris, such as Donald Byrd and Nathan Davis. Last Date, originally a radio broadcast of a concert in Hilversum in the Netherlands, features Misha Mengelberg and Han Bennink, although it was not Dolphy's last public performance. Dolphy was also planning to join Albert Ayler's group, and, according to Fred Moten, was preparing himself to play with Cecil Taylor. He also planned to form a band with Woody Shaw and Billy Higgins, and was writing a string quartet, Love Suite. Personal life and death Dolphy was engaged to marry Joyce Mordecai, a classically trained dancer who resided in Paris. Before he left for Europe in 1964, Dolphy left papers and other effects with his friends Hale Smith and Juanita Smith. Eventually much of this material was passed on to the musician James Newton. It was announced in May 2014 that five boxes of music papers had been donated to the Library of Congress. On June 29, 1964, Dolphy died after falling into a diabetic coma in Berlin. While certain details of his death are still disputed, it is largely accepted that he fell into a coma caused by undiagnosed diabetes. The liner notes to the Complete Prestige Recordings box set say that Dolphy \\"collapsed in his hotel room in Berlin and when brought to the hospital he was diagnosed as being in a diabetic coma. After being administered a shot of insulin he lapsed into insulin shock and died\\". A later documentary and liner notes dispute this, saying Dolphy collapsed on stage in Berlin and was brought to a hospital. The attending hospital physicians did not know that Dolphy was a diabetic and decided on a stereotypical view of jazz musicians related to substance abuse, that he had overdosed on drugs. He was left in a hospital bed for the drugs to run their course. Unbeknownst to doctors, Dolphy was a teetotaler who didn‚Äôt smoke cigarettes or take drugs. Ted Curson remembers, \\"That really broke me up. When Eric got sick on that date [in Berlin], and him being black and a jazz musician, they thought he was a junkie. Eric didn't use any drugs. He was a diabetic‚Äîall they had to do was take a blood test and they would have found that out. So he died for nothing. They gave him some detox stuff and he died, and nobody ever went into that club in Berlin again. That was the end of that club\\".Stop Smiling magazine, Jazz Issue Charles Mingus said, \\"Usually, when a man dies, you remember‚Äîor you say you remember‚Äîonly the good things about him. With Eric, that's all you could remember. I don't remember any drags he did to anybody. The man was absolutely without a need to hurt.\\" Dolphy was buried in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles. His headstone bears the inscription \\"He Lives In His Music.\\" Influence Dolphy's musical presence was influential to many young jazz musicians who would later become prominent. Dolphy worked intermittently with Ron Carter and Freddie Hubbard throughout his career, and in later years he hired Herbie Hancock, Bobby Hutcherson and Woody Shaw to work in his live and studio bands. Out to Lunch! featured yet another young performer, drummer Tony Williams, and Dolphy's participation on Hill's Point of Departure session brought him into contact with the tenor player Joe Henderson. Carter, Hancock and Williams would go on to become one of the quintessential rhythm sections of the decade, both together on their own albums and as the backbone of Miles Davis's second great quintet. This aspect of the second great quintet is an ironic footnote for Davis, who was critical of Dolphy's music: in a 1964 Down Beat \\"Blindfold Test\\", Miles quipped: \\"The next time I see [Dolphy] I'm going to step on his foot.\\" However, Davis new quintet's rhythm section had all worked under Dolphy, thus creating a band whose brand of \\"out\\" was strongly influenced by Dolphy. Dolphy's virtuoso instrumental abilities and unique style of jazz, deeply emotional and free but strongly rooted in tradition and structured composition, heavily influenced such musicians as Anthony Braxton, members of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Oliver Lake, Arthur Blythe, and Don Byron. Awards and honors Dolphy was posthumously inducted into the Down Beat magazine Hall of Fame in 1964. John Coltrane paid tribute to Dolphy in an interview: \\"Whatever I'd say would be an understatement. I can only say my life was made much better by knowing him. He was one of the greatest people I've ever known, as a man, a friend, and a musician.\\" (Following Dolphy's death, his mother gave Coltrane his flute and bass clarinet, and Coltrane, who traveled with Dolphy's photograph, hanging it on his hotel room walls, proceeded to play the instruments on several subsequent recordings.) Frank Zappa acknowledged Dolphy as a musical influence in the liner notes to the 1966 album Freak Out! and included a Dolphy tribute entitled \\"The Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue\\" on his 1970 album Weasels Ripped My Flesh. Pianist Geri Allen analyzed Dolphy's music for her master's thesis at the University of Pittsburgh, and paid tribute to Dolphy in tunes like \\"Dolphy's Dance,\\" recorded and released on her 1992 album Maroons. In 1997, the Vienna Art Orchestra released Powerful Ways: Nine Immortal Non-evergreens for Eric Dolphy as part of its 20th anniversary box set. In 2003, to mark what would have been Dolphy's 75th birthday, a performance was made in his honor of an original composition by Phil Ranelin at the William Grant Still Arts Center in Dolphy's hometown Los Angeles. Additionally, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors designated June 20 as Eric Dolphy Day. In 2014, marking 50 years since Dolphy's death, Berlin-based pianists Alexander von Schlippenbach and Aki Takase led a project, So Long, Eric!, celebrating Dolphy's music and featuring musicians such as Han Bennink, Karl Berger, Tobias Delius, Axel D√∂rner, and Rudi Mahall. That year also saw a Dolphy tribute by a Berlin-based group led by Gebhard Ullmann, who had previously founded a quartet named Out to Lunch in 1983. In the United States, the arts group Seed Artists presented a two-day festival entitled Eric Dolphy: Freedom of Sound in Montclair, NJ that year. Dolphy's compositions are the inspiration for many tribute albums, such as Oliver Lake's Prophet and Dedicated to Dolphy, Jerome Harris' Hidden In Plain View, Otomo Yoshihide's re-imagining of Out to Lunch!, Silke Eberhard's Potsa Lotsa: The Complete Works of Eric Dolphy, and Aki Takase and Rudi Mahall's duo album Duet For Eric Dolphy.

Buscetta participated in criminal activity in Italy, the United States and Brazil before being arrested and extradited from Brazil to Italy. He became disillusioned with the Mafia after the murders of several of his family members, and in 1984, decided to cooperate with the authorities. He provided important testimony at the 1986/87 Maxi Trial, the largest anti-Mafia trial in history. After the murder of the judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, Buscetta gave further testimony to the Antimafia Commission linking Italian politicians to the Mafia. Buscetta entered the Witness Protection Program in the United States, where he remained until his death in 2000. Early life Tommaso Buscetta was born on 13 July 1928, in Palermo, Sicily, the youngest of 17 children; his father was a glazier. Buscetta was raised in a poverty- stricken area of Palermo, which he escaped by getting involved with crime at a young age. He first became involved with the Sicilian Mafia in 1945, and in the following years he became a full-fledged member of the Porta Nuova mandamento, where he worked mostly in cigarette smuggling. Buscetta married his first wife Melchiorra Cavallaro in 1944 and had three children. In 1949, he moved to Argentina and then to Brazil, where he opened a glassworks store, but in 1956, he returned to Palermo where he joined Angelo La Barbera and Salvatore \\"Ciaschiteddu\\" Greco together with mafiosi Antonino Sorci, Pietro Dav√¨ and Gaetano Badalamenti, dealing with the cigarette and drug smuggling. He married his second wife Vera Girotti in 1966 and had one child. Two years later, he married his third wife Cristina De Almeida Guimar√£es after moving to Brazil, and had four children. In 1958 he was arrested for cigarette smuggling and criminal association during an investigation conducted by the Guardia di Finanza against the Corsican Pascal Molinelli and the Tangerian Salomon Gozal, indicated as major suppliers of cigarettes and drugs for the Sicilian gangs; in January 1959 he was arrested again for the smuggling of two tons of cigarettes to supply Yugoslavia. First arrest After the Ciaculli Massacre in 1963, part of an internal Mafia conflict known as the First Mafia War, he was wanted by police. Buscetta fled to Switzerland, Mexico, Canada, and finally the United States.Tratto da \\"ASud'Europa\\", settimanale realizzato dal Centro di Studi e iniziative culturali ‚ÄúPio La Torre‚Äù In 1968, Buscetta was convicted in absentia by an Italian court of two murders related to the Ciaculli Massacre. On 25 August 1970, Buscetta was arrested in Brooklyn, New York, but was released on 4 December 1970. On 21 July 1971, an arrest warrant was issued by Italian police. Buscetta moved to Brazil, having undergone plastic surgery and vocal cord surgery, he set up a drug trafficking network, but on 3 November 1972, was arrested by the Brazilian military government, and subsequently extradited to Italy exactly one month later where he began a ten year sentence at Palermo's Ucciardone prison for drug trafficking, reduced to eight years after appeal. He was later transferred to the Le Nuove prison in Turin. Second arrest In February 1980, he was granted \\"half-freedom\\", immediately fleeing back to Brazil to escape the brewing Second Mafia War instigated by Salvatore Riina. On 11 September 1982, Buscetta's two sons from his first wife, Benedetto and Antonio, disappeared, never to be found again, which prompted his collaboration with Italian authorities. This was followed by the deaths of his brother Vincenzo, son-in-law Giuseppe Genova, brother-in- law Pietro and four of his nephews, Domenico and Benedetto Buscetta, and Orazio and Antonio D'Amico. The war subsequently led to the deaths of many of Buscetta's allies, including Stefano Bontade. Buscetta was arrested in S√£o Paulo, Brazil once again on 23 October 1983. He was extradited to Italy on 28 June 1984, where he attempted suicide by ingestion of barbiturates; when that failed, he decided that he was utterly disillusioned with the Mafia. Buscetta asked to talk to the anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, and began his life as an informant, referred to as a pentito. Pentito Buscetta (in sunglasses) is led into court at the Maxi Trial, circa 1986. Buscetta revealed information to Falcone for 45 days, explaining the inner workings and hierarchical structures of Cosa Nostra including the Sicilian Mafia Commission,http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=894340 that, until then, were unclear because of the strict code of silence. This became known as the \\"Buscetta theorem\\". He also revealed Mafia initiation rituals. However, Buscetta refused to speak with Falcone of the political ties of Cosa Nostra because, in his opinion, the State was not ready for statements of that magnitude, and proved to be quite general on that subject. In December 1984, he was extradited to the United States where he received a new identity from the government, American citizenship and placed in the Witness Protection Program in exchange for new revelations against the American Mafia. He testified in the Pizza Connection Trial, which took place in 1985 in New York and saw defendants Gaetano Badalamenti and other Sicilian-American mafiosi accused of drug trafficking. He also testified in 1986 at the largest trial against the Mafia in history, the Maxi Trial in Palermo, arising from the statements made to Falcone, Buscetta helped judges Falcone and Paolo Borsellino achieve significant success in the fight against organized crime that led to 475 Mafia members indicted, and 338 convicted, sentences upheld in 1992. In mid-1992, following the bomb attacks in which Falcone and Borsellino were killed, Buscetta began to speak of the political ties of the Cosa Nostra with magistrates, accusing Salvo Lima, killed a few months earlier, and Giulio Andreotti of being the main political referents of the organization; in particular, he reported that he had known Lima personally since the late 1950s, and had met him last in 1980, and also reported that he had learned that the murder of the journalist Mino Pecorelli in 1979 would have been carried out in the Andreotti's interest. Buscetta was one of the main witnesses of the trials against Andreotti for mafia association and for the Pecorelli murder. Andreotti was however, eventually acquitted, in 1999, of the charge of having commissioned the assassination of Pecorelli. In court, Buscetta also elaborated in great detail the hidden exchanges that linked politicians and the Mafia. He stated: > It is not Cosa Nostra that contacts the politician; instead a member of the > Cosa Nostra says, that president is mine (√® cosa mia), and if you need a > favor, you must go through me.

He was buried under a false name in North Miami, Florida. In popular culture He was played by F. Murray Abraham in the 1999 film Excellent Cadavers and by Vincent Riotta in the 2007 mini-series Il Capo dei Capi. He was portrayed by Sergio Vespertino in the 2016 Italian TV series The Mafia Kills Only in Summer. He was portrayed by Pierfrancesco Favino in the 2019 film The Traitor, directed by Marco Bellocchio and selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.

Such artifacts may appear \\"too advanced\\" for the technology known to have existed at the time, or may suggest human presence at a time before humans are known to have existed. Other examples may suggest contact between different cultures that is hard to account for with conventional historical understanding. The term is used in fringe science such as cryptozoology, as well as by proponents of ancient astronaut theories, young Earth creationists, and paranormal enthusiasts. It can describe a wide variety of objects, from anomalies studied by mainstream science to pseudoarchaeology far outside the mainstream to objects that have been shown to be hoaxes or to have mundane explanations. Critics argue that most purported OOPArts which are not hoaxes are the result of mistaken interpretation and wishful thinking, such as a mistaken belief that a particular culture could not have created an artifact or technology due to a lack of knowledge or materials. In some cases, the uncertainty results from inaccurate descriptions. For example, the cuboid Wolfsegg Iron is not really a perfect cube, nor are the Klerksdorp spheres actual perfect spheres. The Iron pillar of Delhi was said to be \\"rust proof\\", but it has some rust near its base; its relative resistance to corrosion is due to slag inclusions left over from the manufacturing conditions and environmental factors. Supporters regard OOPArts as evidence that mainstream science is overlooking huge areas of knowledge, either willfully or through ignorance. Many writers or researchers who question conventional views of human history have used purported OOPArts in attempts to bolster their arguments. Creation science often relies on allegedly anomalous finds in the archaeological record to challenge scientific chronologies and models of human evolution.Stromberg, P, and PV Heinrich (2004) The Coso Artifact Mystery from the Depths of Time? , Reports of the National Center for Science Education. 24(2):26‚Äì30 (March/April 2004) Retrieved March 8, 2014.

An example of this is the understanding of quantity in terms of directionality (e.g. \\"the price of peace is rising\\") or the understanding of time in terms of money (e.g. \\"I spent time at work today\\"). A conceptual domain can be any mental organization of human experience. The regularity with which different languages employ the same metaphors, often perceptually based, has led to the hypothesis that the mapping between conceptual domains corresponds to neural mappings in the brain.e.g. Feldman, J. and Narayanan, S. (2004). Embodied meaning in a neural theory of language. Brain and Language, 89(2):385‚Äì392 This theory has gained wide attention, although some researchers question its empirical accuracy. This idea, and a detailed examination of the underlying processes, was first extensively explored by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their work Metaphors We Live By in 1980. Since then, the field of metaphor studies within the larger discipline of cognitive linguistics has increasingly developed, with several annual academic conferences, scholarly societies, and research labs contributing to the subject area. Some researchers, such as Gerard Steen, have worked to develop empirical investigative tools for metaphor research, including the Metaphor Identification Procedure, or MIP. In Psychology, Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr., has investigated conceptual metaphor and embodiment through a number of psychological experiments. Other cognitive scientists, for example Gilles Fauconnier, study subjects similar to conceptual metaphor under the labels \\"analogy\\", \\"conceptual blending\\" and \\"ideasthesia\\". Conceptual metaphors are useful for understanding complex ideas in simple terms and therefore are frequently used to give insight to abstract theories and models. For example, the conceptual metaphor of viewing communication as a conduit is one large theory explained with a metaphor. So not only is our everyday communication shaped by the language of conceptual metaphors, but so is the very way we understand scholarly theories. These metaphors are prevalent in communication and we do not just use them in language; we actually perceive and act in accordance with the metaphors.  Criticism and Perspectives on Metaphor  = Historical = In the Western philosophical tradition, Aristotle is often situated as the first commentator on the nature of metaphor, writing in the Poetics, \\"A 'metaphorical term' involves the transferred use of a term that properly belongs to something else,\\"Aristotle. Poetics.English text: D.A. Russell and M. Winterbottom (eds.), in Ancient Literary Criticism: The Principal Texts in New Translation. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1972. and elsewhere in the Rhetoric he says that metaphors make learning pleasant; \\"To learn easily is naturally pleasant to all people, and words signify something, so whatever words create knowledge in us are the pleasantest.\\"Aristotle, W. Rhys Roberts, Ingram Bywater, and Friedrich Solmsen. Rhetoric. New York: Modern Library, 1954. Print. Aristotle's writings on metaphor constitute a \\"substitution view\\" of metaphor, wherein a metaphor is simply a decorative word or phrase substituted for a more ordinary one. This has been sometimes called the \\"Traditional View of Metaphor\\"Soskice, Janet. Metaphor and Religious Language. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985. and at other times the \\"Classical Theory of Metaphor\\".Lakoff, George and Mark Johnson. Metaphors We Live By. Chicago: Chicago UP, 1980. Later in the first century A.D., the Roman rhetorician Quintilian builds upon Aristotle's earlier work of metaphor by focusing more on the comparative function of metaphorical language. In his work Institutio Oratoria, Quintilian states,\\" In totum autem metaphora brevior est similitudo\\" or \\"on the whole, metaphor is a shorter form of simile\\".Quintilian. Institutio Oratoria. Trans. H.E. Butler. London: William Heinemann, 1921. Vol. III. Other philosophers throughout history have lent their perspectives to the discussion of metaphor as well. Friedrich Nietzsche for example, claimed that language as a whole did not portray reality but instead made a series of bold metaphors. Nietzsche believed that each step of cognition, the transfer of real world information to nerve stimuli, the culmination of nerve stimuli into mental images, the translation of mental images to words, was metaphorical. Modern interpretations of these early theories have also been intensely debated. Janet Soskice, Professor of Philosophical Theology at the University of Cambridge, writes in summary that \\"it is certain that we shall taste the freshness of their insights only if we free them from the obligation to answer questions that were never theirs to ask\\". George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, although originally taking a hard-line interpretation of these early authorsWood, Matthew S. \\"Aristotle's Theory of Metaphor Revisited.\\" Mouseion: Journal of the Classical Association of Canada, 14.1 (2017): 63-90. Print. later concede that Aristotle was working within a different philosophical framework from what we engage with today and that critical interpretations should take this in to account.Lakoff, George, and Mark Johnson. Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Philosophy. New York: Basic Books, 1999. = Modern = In his 2007 book The Stuff of Thought, cognitive scientist Stephen Pinker lays out several useful classifications for the study of conceptual metaphor. Pinker first contrasts two perspectives on metaphor, what he calls the killjoy theory and the messianic theory. The killjoy theory categorizes metaphors as \\"dead\\", that is it asserts that modern day speakers are not aware of the comparison made between source and target domains in the everyday metaphors they use. For example, many are not cognizant that the phrase \\"to come to a head\\" refers to the accumulation of pus in a pimple. In contrast, the messianic theory correlates more closely with Lakoff and Johnson's idea of a conceptual metaphor. This view states that users of metaphors are aware of how the metaphor maps onto the domains and use them to relate shared perceptual experiences to more complex thoughts. Another important distinction made by Pinker is that between literary, or poetic metaphors, and conceptual, or generative metaphors. Poetic metaphors are used for a variety of reasons but ultimately highlight similarities or incongruencies in an expressive manner. Pinker's example of this being the classic Shakespearian line \\"Juliet is the sun\\". These metaphors can often appear convoluted or unclear without deeper context. Conceptual metaphors result from some inherent relation between two domains. These metaphors, so innate they are considered cliche are interestingly able to generate infinite new metaphors. For example, thinking back on the conceptual metaphor , one can build many new metaphors such as \\"I shot him down\\" or \\"he blew my argument to pieces\\". Pinker himself settles on a moderate view that falls in between the messianic and killjoy theories on metaphor. Perhaps most interestingly, while Pinker concedes that metaphor is a useful way to combat the limited ability of language to express thought, he postulates that a higher level of abstract thought must still be present. Otherwise, Pinker points out, how could we engage in critique of metaphors or employ metaphors for comedic effect? Major criticisms of work done on conceptual metaphor stem from the way many researchers conduct their research. Many study metaphors in a \\"top-down\\" direction, looking first at a few examples to suggest conceptual metaphors, then examining the structure of those metaphors. Researchers would look at their own lexicon, dictionaries, thesauri, and other corpus to study metaphors in language. Critics say this ignored the way language was actually used and focused too much on the hypothetical metaphors, so many irregularities were overlooked in favor of postulating universal conceptual metaphors. In 2007, Pragglejaz Group came up with a methodology for identifying metaphorical expressions as a response to these criticisms.  Mappings  There are two main roles for the conceptual domains posited in conceptual metaphors: * Source domain: the conceptual domain from which we draw metaphorical expressions (e.g., love is a journey). * Target domain: the conceptual domain that we try to understand (e.g., love is a journey). A mapping is the way in which a source domain tracks onto and describes aspects of the target domain. Mappings describe the mental organization of information in domains, the underlying phenomenon that drives metaphorical usage in language. This conceptualization relates closely to image schemas, mental representations used in reasoning, through the extension spatial and physical laws to more complex situations.K√∂vecses, Zoltan (2010) Metaphor: A Practical Introduction A primary tenet of this theory is that metaphors are matter of thought and not merely of language: hence, the term conceptual metaphor. The metaphor may seem to consist of words or other linguistic expressions that come from the terminology of the more concrete conceptual domain, but conceptual metaphors underlie a system of related metaphorical expressions that appear on the linguistic surface. Similarly, the mappings of a conceptual metaphor are themselves motivated by image schemas which are pre-linguistic schemas concerning space, time, moving, controlling, and other core elements of embodied human experience. Conceptual metaphors typically employ a more abstract concept as target and a more concrete or physical concept as their source. For instance, metaphors such as 'the days [the more abstract or target concept] ahead' or 'giving my time' rely on more concrete concepts, thus expressing time as a path into physical space, or as a substance that can be handled and offered as a gift. Different conceptual metaphors tend to be invoked when the speaker is trying to make a case for a certain point of view or course of action. For instance, one might associate \\"the days ahead\\" with leadership, whereas the phrase \\"giving my time\\" carries stronger connotations of bargaining. Selection of such metaphors tends to be directed by a subconscious or implicit habit in the mind of the person employing them. The principle of unidirectionality states that the metaphorical process typically goes from the more concrete to the more abstract, and not the other way around. Accordingly, abstract concepts are understood in terms of prototype concrete processes. The term \\"concrete,\\" in this theory, has been further specified by Lakoff and Johnson as more closely related to the developmental, physical neural, and interactive body (see embodied philosophy). One manifestation of this view is found in the cognitive science of mathematics, where it is proposed that mathematics itself, the most widely accepted means of abstraction in the human community, is largely metaphorically constructed, and thereby reflects a cognitive bias unique to humans that uses embodied prototypical processes (e.g. counting, moving along a path) that are understood by all human beings through their experiences.  Conduit metaphor  The conduit metaphor is a dominant class of figurative expressions used when discussing communication itself (metalanguage). It operates whenever people speak or write as if they \\"insert\\" their mental contents (feelings, meanings, thoughts, concepts, etc.) into \\"containers\\" (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) whose contents are then \\"extracted\\" by listeners and readers. Thus, language is viewed as a \\"conduit\\" conveying mental content between people. Defined and described by linguist Michael J. Reddy, PhD, his proposal of this conceptual metaphor refocused debate within and outside the linguistic community on the importance of metaphorical language.Reddy, M. J. (1979). The conduit metaphor: A case of frame conflict in our language about language. In A. Ortony (Ed.), Metaphor and Thought(pp. 284‚Äì310). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. paperback  Language and culture as mappings  In their 1980 work, Lakoff and Johnson closely examined a collection of basic conceptual metaphors, including:   The latter half of each of these phrases invokes certain assumptions about concrete experience and requires the reader or listener to apply them to the preceding abstract concepts of love or organizing in order to understand the sentence in which the conceptual metaphor is used. There are numerous ways in which conceptual metaphors shape human perception and communication, especially in mass media and in public policy. Recent experiments by Thibodeau and Boroditsky substantiate this line of thought, termed \\"framing\\". In the experiments, conceptual metaphors that compared crime to either a beast or a disease had drastic effects on public policy opinions. Conceptual metaphors are commonplace in language. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson suggest that metaphors may unconsciously shape the way we think and act in their founding work, Metaphors We Live By (1980). For example, take the commonly used conceptual metaphor, .Lakoff and Johnson, Ch.1-3 This metaphor shapes our language in the way we view argument as a battle to be won. It is not uncommon to hear someone say \\"He won that argument\\" or \\"I attacked every weak point in his argument\\". The very way argument is conceptualized is shaped by this metaphor of arguments being a war. Argument can be seen in other ways than a battle, but we use this concept to shape the way we think of argument and the way we go about arguing. The same applies for the other conceptual metaphors. Lakoff and Johnson focus on English, and cognitive scholars writing in English have tended not to investigate the discourse of foreign languages in any great detail to determine the creative ways in which individuals negotiate, resist, and consolidate conceptual metaphors. Andrew Goatly in his book Washing the Brain (2007) considers ideological conceptual metaphors as well as Chinese conceptual metaphors. James W. Underhill, a modern Humboldtian scholar, attempts to reestablish Wilhelm von Humboldt's concern for the different ways languages frame reality, and the strategies individuals adopt in creatively resisting and modifying existing patterns of thought. Taking on board the Lakoff-Johnson paradigm of conceptual metaphor, he investigates the way in which Czech communists appropriated the concept of the people, the state and struggle, and the way German Communists harnessed concepts of eternity and purity. He also reminds us that, as Klemperer demonstrates, resisting patterns of thought means engaging in conceptual metaphors and refusing the logic that ideologies impose upon them. In multilingual studies (based on Czech, German, French & English), Underhill considers how different cultures reformulate key concepts such as truth, love, hate and war.'Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts', Cambridge University Press 2012, and 'Creating Worldviews', Edinburgh University Press 2011.  Family roles and ethics  George Lakoff makes similar claims on the overlap of conceptual metaphors, culture, and society in his book Moral Politics and his later book on framing, Don't Think of an Elephant!. Lakoff claims that the public political arena in America reflects a basic conceptual metaphor of 'the family.' Accordingly, people understand political leaders in terms of 'strict father' and 'nurturant mother' roles. Two basic views of political economy arise from this desire to see the nation-state act 'more like a father' or 'more like a mother.' He further amplified these views in his latest book, The Political Mind. Urban theorist and ethicist Jane Jacobs made this distinction in less gender-driven terms by differentiating between a 'Guardian Ethic' and a 'Trader Ethic'.Jacobs, J. 'Systems of Survival', Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1993. . She states that guarding and trading are two concrete activities that human beings must learn to apply metaphorically to all choices in later life. In a society where guarding children is the primary female duty and trading in a market economy is the primary male duty, Lakoff posits that children assign the 'guardian' and 'trader' roles to their mothers and fathers, respectively.  Linguistics and politics  Lakoff, Johnson, and Pinker are among the many cognitive scientists that devote a significant amount of time to current events and political theory, suggesting that respected linguists and theorists of conceptual metaphor may tend to channel their theories into political realms. Critics of this ethics-driven approach to language tend to accept that idioms reflect underlying conceptual metaphors, but that actual grammar, and the more basic cross-cultural concepts of scientific method and mathematical practice tend to minimize the impact of metaphors. Such critics tend to see Lakoff and Jacobs as 'left-wing figures,' and would not accept their politics as any kind of crusade against an ontology embedded in language and culture, but rather, as an idiosyncratic pastime, not part of the science of linguistics nor of much use. And others further, such as Deleuze and Guattari, Michel Foucault and, more recently, Manuel de Landa would criticize both of these two positions for mutually constituting the same old ontological ideology that would try to separate two parts of a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Lakoff's 1987 work, Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things, answered some of these criticisms before they were even made: he explores the effects of cognitive metaphors (both culturally specific and human-universal) on the grammar per se of several languages, and the evidence of the limitations of the classical logical-positivist or Anglo-American School philosophical concept of the category usually used to explain or describe the scientific method. Lakoff's reliance on empirical scientific evidence, i.e. specifically falsifiable predictions, in the 1987 work and in Philosophy in the Flesh (1999) suggests that the cognitive-metaphor position has no objections to the scientific method, but instead considers the scientific method a finely developed reasoning system used to discover phenomena which are subsequently understood in terms of new conceptual metaphors (such as the metaphor of fluid motion for conducted electricity, which is described in terms of \\"current\\" \\"flowing\\" against \\"impedance,\\" or the gravitational metaphor for static-electric phenomena, or the \\"planetary orbit\\" model of the atomic nucleus and electrons, as used by Niels Bohr). Further, partly in response to such criticisms, Lakoff and Rafael E. N√∫√±ez, in 2000, proposed a cognitive science of mathematics that would explain mathematics as a consequence of, not an alternative to, the human reliance on conceptual metaphor to understand abstraction in terms of basic experiential concretes. Literature The Linguistic Society of America has argued that \\"the most recent linguistic approach to literature is that of cognitive metaphor, which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language, but a mode of thought. Metaphors project structures from source domains of schematized bodily or enculturated experience into abstract target domains. We conceive the abstract idea of life in terms of our experiences of a journey, a year, or a day. We do not understand Robert Frost's 'Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening' to be about a horse-and-wagon journey but about life. We understand Emily Dickinson's 'Because I could not stop for Death' as a poem about the end of the human life span, not a trip in a carriage. This work is redefining the critical notion of imagery. Perhaps for this reason, cognitive metaphor has significant promise for some kind of rapprochement between linguistics and literary study.\\" Education Teaching thinking by analogy (metaphor) is one of the main themes of The Private Eye Project. The idea of encouraging use of conceptual metaphors can also been seen in other educational programs touting the cultivation of \\"critical thinking skills\\". The work of political scientist R≈´ta Kazlauskaitƒó examines metaphorical models in school-history knowledge of the controversial Polish-Lithuanian past. On the basis of Lakoff and Johnson's conceptual metaphor theory, she shows how the implicit metaphorical models of everyday experience, which inform the abstract conceptualization of the past, truth, objectivity, knowledge, and multiperspectivity in the school textbooks, obstruct an understanding of the divergent narratives of past experience. Language learning There is some evidence that an understanding of underlying conceptual metaphors can aid the retention of vocabulary for people learning a foreign language. To improve learners' awareness of conceptual metaphor, one monolingual learner's dictionary, the Macmillan English Dictionary has introduced 50 or so 'metaphor boxes' covering the most salient Lakoffian metaphors in English.Bejoint, H. The Lexicography of English, Oxford University Press 2010: 189 For example, the dictionary entry for conversation includes a box with the heading: 'A conversation is like a journey, with the speakers going from one place to another', followed by vocabulary items (words and phrases) which embody this metaphorical schema. Language teaching experts are beginning to explore the relevance of conceptual metaphor to how learners learn and what teachers do in the classroom.Holme, Randal, Mind, Metaphor and Language Teaching. London: Palgrave 2004 Conceptual metaphorical mapping in animals A current study showed a natural tendency to systematically map an abstract dimension, such as social status, in our closest and non-linguistic relatives, the chimpanzees.Dahl, C. D. and Adachi, I. 'Conceptual metaphorical mapping in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)', eLife 2013;2:e00932. In detail, discrimination performances between familiar conspecific faces were systematically modulated by the spatial location and the social status of the presented individuals, leading to discrimination facilitation or deterioration. High-ranked individuals presented at spatially higher position and low-ranked individuals presented at lower position led to discrimination facilitation, while high-ranked individuals at lower positions and low-ranked individuals at higher position led to discrimination deterioration. This suggests that this tendency had already evolved in the common ancestors of humans and chimpanzees and is not uniquely human, but describes a conceptual metaphorical mapping that predates language.

Models and theoretical accounts of cognitive linguistics are considered as psychologically real, and research in cognitive linguistics aims to help understand cognition in general and is seen as a road into the human mind. There has been scientific and terminological controversy around the label 'cognitive linguistics'; there is no consensus on what specifically is meant with the term.  Background  The roots of cognitive linguistics are in Noam Chomsky‚Äôs 1959 critical review of B. F. Skinner‚Äôs Verbal Behavior. Chomsky's rejection of behavioural psychology and his subsequent anti- behaviourist activity helped bring about a shift of focus from empiricism to mentalism in psychology under the new concepts of cognitive psychology and cognitive science. Chomsky considered linguistics as a subfield of cognitive science in the 1970s but called his model transformational or generative grammar. Having been engaged with Chomsky in the linguistic wars, George Lakoff united in the early 1980s with Ronald Langacker and other advocates of neo-Darwinian linguistics in a so-called ‚ÄùLakoff‚ÄîLangacker agreement‚Äù. It is suggested that they picked the name ‚Äùcognitive linguistics‚Äù for their new framework to undermine the reputation of generative grammar as a cognitive science. Consequently, there are three competing approaches that today consider themselves as true representatives of cognitive linguistics. One is the Lakoffian‚ÄîLangackerian brand with capitalised initials (Cognitive Linguistics). The second is generative grammar, while the third approach is proposed by scholars whose work falls outside the scope of the other two. They argue that cognitive linguistics should not be taken as the name of a specific selective framework, but as a whole field of scientific research that is assessed by its evidential rather than theoretical value.  Approaches  =Generative Grammar= Generative grammar functions as a source of hypotheses about language computation in the mind and brain. It is argued to be the study of 'the cognitive neuroscience of language'. Generative grammar studies behavioural instincts and the biological nature of cognitive- linguistic algorithms, providing a computational‚Äìrepresentational theory of mind. This in practice means that sentence analysis by linguists is taken as a way to uncover cognitive structures. It is argued that a random genetic mutation in humans has caused syntactic structures to appear in the mind. Therefore, the fact that people have language does not rely on its communicative purposes. For a famous example, it was argued by linguist Noam Chomsky that sentences of the type \\"Is the man who is hungry ordering dinner\\" are so rare that it is unlikely that children will have heard them. Since they can nonetheless produce them, it was further argued that the structure is not learned but acquired from an innate cognitive language component. Generative grammarians then took as their task to find out all about innate structures through introspection in order to form a picture of the hypothesised language faculty. Generative grammar promotes a modular view of the mind, considering language as an autonomous mind module. Thus, language is separated from mathematical logic to the extent that inference plays no role in language acquisition. Other than in linguistics, Chomsky's ideas have been influential in cognitive psychology, computer science and socialist libertarian thinking. =Cognitive Linguistics (linguistics framework)= One of the approaches to cognitive linguistics is called Cognitive Linguistics, with capital initials, but it is also often spelled cognitive linguistics with all lowercase letters. This movement saw its beginning in early 1980s when George Lakoff's metaphor theory was united with Ronald Langacker's Cognitive Grammar, with subsequent models of Construction Grammar following from various authors. The union entails two different approaches to linguistic and cultural evolution: that of the conceptual metaphor, and the construction. Cognitive Linguistics defines itself in opposition to generative grammar, arguing that language functions in the brain according to general cognitive principles. Lakoff's and Langacker's ideas are applied across sciences. In addition to linguistics and translation theory, Cognitive Linguistics is influential in literary studies, education, sociology, musicology, computer science and theology. A. Conceptual metaphor theory According to American linguist George Lakoff, metaphors are not just figures of speech, but modes of thought. Lakoff hypothesises that principles of abstract reasoning may have evolved from visual thinking and mechanisms for representing spatial relations that are present in lower animals. Conceptualisation is regarded as being based on the embodiment of knowledge, building on physical experience of vision and motion. For example, the 'metaphor' of emotion builds on downward motion while the metaphor of reason builds on upward motion, as in saying ‚ÄúThe discussion fell to the emotional level, but I raised it back up to the rational plane.\\" It is argued that language is not a cognitive capacity, but instead relies on other cognitive skills which include perception, attention, motor skills, and visual and spatial processing. Same is said of other cognitive phenomena such as the sense of time: ::\\"In our visual systems, we have detectors for motion and detectors for objects/locations. We do not have detectors for time (whatever that could mean). Thus, it makes good biological sense that time should be understood in terms of things and motion.\\" ‚ÄîGeorge Lakoff In Cognitive Linguistics, thinking is argued to be mainly automatic and unconscious. Like in neuro-linguistic programming, language is approached via the senses. Cognitive linguists study the embodiment of knowledge by seeking expressions which relate to modal schemas. For example, in the expression \\"It is quarter to eleven\\", the preposition to represents a modal schema which is manifested in language as a visual or sensorimotoric 'metaphor'. B. Cognitive and construction grammar Constructions, as the basic units of grammar, are conventionalised form‚Äìmeaning pairings which are comparable to memes as units of linguistic evolution. These are considered multi-layered. For example, idioms are higher-level constructions which contain words as middle-level constructions, and these may contain morphemes as lower-level constructions. It is argued that humans do not only share the same body type, allowing a common ground for embodied representations; but constructions provide common ground for uniform expressions within a speech community. Like biological organisms, constructions have life cycles which are studied by linguists. According to the cognitive and constructionist view, there is no grammar in the traditional sense of the word. What is commonly perceived as grammar is an inventory of constructions; a complex adaptive system; or a population of constructions. Constructions are studied in all fields of language research from language acquisition to corpus linguistics. =Integrative cognitive linguistics= There is also a third approach to cognitive linguistics which neither directly supports the modular (Generative Grammar) nor the anti- modular (Cognitive Linguistics) view of the mind. Proponents of the third view argue that, according to brain research, language processing is specialised although not autonomous from other types of information processing. Language is thought of as one of human cognitive abilities alongside with perception, attention, memory, motor skills, and visual and spatial processing, rather than being subordinate to them. Emphasis is laid on a cognitive semantics that studies the contextual‚Äìconceptual nature of meaning.  Controversy  The specific meaning of cognitive linguistics, the proper address of the name, and the scientific status of the enterprise have been called into question. It is claimed that much of so-called cognitive linguistics fails to live up to its name. It is suggested that the aforementioned frameworks, which make use of the label ‚Äôcognitive‚Äô, are pseudoscience because their views of the mind and brain defy basic modern understanding of neuroscience, and are instead based on scientifically unjustified guru teachings. Members of such frameworks are also said to have used other researchers‚Äô findings to present them as their own work. While this criticism is accepted for most part, it is claimed that some of the research has nonetheless produced useful insights.

Iconic principles: *Quantity principle: conceptual complexity corresponds to formal complexity *Proximity principle: conceptual distance tends to match with linguistic distance *Sequential order principle: the sequential order of events described is mirrored in the speech chain Quantity principle The use of quantity of phonetic material to iconically mark increased quality or quantity can be noted in the lengthening of words to indicate a greater degree, such as \\"\\". It is also common to use reduplication to iconically mark increase, as Edward Sapir is quoted, ‚ÄúThe process is generally employed, with self-evident symbolism, to indicate such concepts as distribution, plurality, repetition, customary activity, increase of size, added intensity, continuance‚Äù (1921:79). This has been confirmed by the comparative studies of Key (1965) and Moravcsik (1978).Moravcsik (1978) This can be seen, for example, in Amharic, where ' means \\"it was broken\\" and ' means that \\"it was shattered\\". Iconic coding principles may be natural tendencies in language and are also part of our cognitive and biological make-up. Whether iconicity is a part of language is an open debate in linguistics. For instance, Haspelmath has argued against iconicity, claiming that most iconic phenomena can be explained by frequency biases: since simpler meanings tend to be more frequent in the language use they tend to lose phonological material. Onomatopoeia (and mimesis more broadly) may be seen as a kind of iconicity, though even onomatopoeic sounds have a large degree of arbitrariness. The evolution of language Derek Bickerton has posited that iconic signs, both verbal and gestural, were crucial in the evolution of human language. Animal communication systems, Bickerton has argued, are largely composed of indexical (and, occasionally, iconic) signs, whereas in human language, \\"most words are symbolic, and ... without symbolic words we couldn‚Äôt have language\\". The distinction Bickerton draws between these categories is one of displacement, with the indexical signs of animal communication systems having no capacity for displacement, and the symbolic signs of human language requiring it. Iconic signs, however, \\"may or may not have it depending on how they‚Äôre used ... iconicity, therefore, is the most probable road that our ancestors took into language\\". Using a niche- construction view of human evolution, Bickerton has hypothesized that human ancestors used iconic signs as recruitment signals in the scavenging of dead megafauna. This process \\"would have created new words and deployed old words in new contexts, further weakening the uncoupling of words from situations, from current occurrence‚Äîeven from fitness\\", and thus allowing for the creation of symbolic language. In The Symbolic Species, Terrence Deacon argues that the emanation of symbolic capacities unique to language was a critical factor in the evolution of the human brain, and that these symbolic capacities are vital to differentiating animal from human forms of communication, processes of learning, and brain anatomy. \\"The doorway into this virtual world was opened to us alone by the evolution of language, because language is not merely a mode of communication, it is also the outward expression of an unusual mode of thought‚Äîsymbolic representation.\\" Calls and gestures Iconic calls and gestures mimic the forms of the things they stand for (such as outlining shapes or moving your hands back and forth multiple times to show repetition.) Iconic calls and gestures are not formally considered language, or language- like communication in that they do not contrast or possess arbitrary characteristics. Noises that imitate sounds of the surrounding environment (ideophones) are also iconic. Though humans possess a repertoire of iconic calls and gestures, other mammals produce few iconic signals. Despite this, a few captive chimpanzees have shown the beginning stages of iconicity. Burling et al. states: \\"Chimpanzees in the wild do not point, and rarely do so in captivity, however there is a documented case of one named Kanzi, described by Savage-Rumbaugh et al., who could indicate direction of travel by \\"extending his hand\\". Another chimpanzee, Viki (Hayes and Nissen 1971:107) made motions of kneading or ironing when she wanted to knead dough or iron napkins. Bee dances are another example of iconicity in animal communication systems. Sign languages Iconicity is often argued to play a large role in the production and perception of gesture. Proposed ways in which iconicity is achieved is through Hands that Act, Embody, Model, and Draw. In sign languages iconicity was often argued to be largely confined to sign formation (comparable to onomatopoeia). Some proponents believe that iconicity does not play an actual role in perception and production of signs once they have undergone phonological reduction and become part of the conventionalized vocabulary.Frishburg (1975). More recently, as sign language researchers gain confidence (and the fear of losing linguistic status subsidies), the possible role of iconicity is being evaluated again. Current research on sign language phonology acknowledges that certain aspects are semantically motivated. Further, the ability to modify sign meaning through phonological changes to signs is gaining attention. The ability to work creatively with sign language in this way has been associated with accomplished, or native signers. Iconicity is expressed in the grammatical structure of sign languages called classifiers. These are used to give descriptive information about a subject or verb. In American Sign language (ASL) a grammatical marker denoting ‚Äúintensity‚Äù is characterized by a movement pattern with two parts: an initial pause, followed by a quick completion. When this pattern is added to the adjective GOOD the resulting meaning is VERY-GOOD.Wilcox (2004) The ASL marker for \\"intensity\\" is iconic in that the intended meaning (building of pressure, a sudden release) is matched by the articulatory form (a pause, a quick completion). Like in vocal languages, developmental trends in ASL shy away from iconicity in favor of arbitrariness. These changes \\"contribute toward symmetry, fluidity, locational displacement and assimilation\\". For example, the sign WE used to contain the sign for each individual being described by the WE. So the signer would sign ME + YOU1 \\\\+ YOU2 \\\\+ YOU n \\\\+ ME. Now the sign has turned into a smooth symbolic sign where the signer makes two touches on the chest, one on each side, with a sweep of the wrist in between. Poetry Iconicity often occurs within poetry through the use of onomatopoeia, which may be called auditory iconicity. Sometimes the form of the poem resembles or enacts the poem's content, and in this case, a visual iconicity is present. One poet well known for his visual poems, and therefore visual iconicity, is E. E. Cummings. A subset of visual iconicity involves a spatial iconicity. For instance, in Cummings's grasshopper poem (\\"r-p-o-p-h-e- s-s-a-g-r\\") the word \\"arriving\\" begins on the far right of the poem with the \\"a\\", the \\"r\\" is near the middle of the poem, and the rest of the word is on the left of the poem. The reader must travel a great distance across the poem, therefore, in order to \\"arrive\\". The spatial dimension, then, can relate to a temporal dimension. In the poems \\"The Fish\\" and \\"The Moose\\" by Elizabeth Bishop, temporal iconicity is at work. The amount of time it takes to read \\"The Fish\\" coincides with the length of time a fish could live outside of water; likewise, the duration of the long bus ride in \\"The Moose\\" coincides with the poem's long first sentence as well as the twenty-some stanzas it takes before the passengers on the bus (and the reader) actually encounters the moose. Folk etymology Iconicity occurs in rejective phono-semantic matching. \\"Consider Lithuanian Ashkenazic Hebrew ◊®◊¢ ◊ì◊ù ra dom (cf. Yiddish ra dam), lit. 'of bad blood' (from Hebrew ◊®◊¢ ◊ì◊ù ra\` dam 'of bad blood'). This is a toponymic rejective phono-semantic matching of Polish Radom, the name of a town in Poland (approximately south of Warsaw), or of its Yiddish adaptation r√≥dem (see Uriel Weinreich 1955: 609, Paul Wexler 1991: 42). Thus, if a pogrom had occurred in Radom, it would surely have been rationalized by ra dam ‚Äòof bad blood‚Äô. Obviously, providing such an etymythological explanation for the pogrom was regarded by some Jews as a mere play on words. However, others might have conceived of ra dam as having deep intrinsic truth, which might have been religiously and homiletically based. One should not forget that at that time it was a common belief that all languages were God-created and that Hebrew was the divine Ursprache.\\"See p. 246 of Zuckermann, Ghil‚Äòad (2006), \\"'Etymythological Othering' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective\\", Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion, edited by Tope Omoniyi and Joshua A. Fishman, Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 237‚Äì258. Language acquisition It has been suggested that iconicity can be used in the teaching of languages. There are two ways this has been suggested. The first being ‚ÄúHorizontal- Iconicity‚Äù and the second being vowel magnitude relationships. Horizontal- Iconicity is the phenomenon of opposition of meaning and spelling. For example, in Egyptian mer, which means right hand and rem, which means left hand. Because people are more likely to remember things they have more Mnemonic tags for, it is suggested that it may be helpful to point these things out in the teaching of language.Croft (1978) Vowel magnitude Vowel magnitude relationships suggest that, the larger the object, the more likely its name has open vowels such as , , and ; the smaller the object, the more likely its name has closed vowel sounds such as , , and . Open vowel sounds are also more likely to be associated with round shapes and dark or gloomy moods, where closed vowel sounds are more likely to be associated with pointed shapes and happy moods. A test run by Sapir asked subjects to differentiate between two different sized tables using invented word pairs such as \\"mal\\" and \\"mil\\". He discovered a word containing was at four times more likely to be judged as larger if paired with a word containing . Nuckolls states: \\"Newman discovered that ... as the tongue recedes in articulating vowels from the front to the back of the mouth, and as acoustic frequencies become lower, the vowels are judged to be larger and darker\\". Bentley and Varron (1933) ran tests asking subjects to differentiate between vowel sounds without providing them, beforehand, contrasting attributes (such as bright and dark.) They found only moderate success rates that decreased when vowel sounds were closer in tone. However, they still found that sounds were judged larger or lower than sounds. In morphology, examples from degree adjectives, such as long, longer, longest, show that the most extreme degree of length is iconically represented by the word with the greatest number of phonemes. Jakobson cites examples of word order mimicking the natural order of ideas. In fact, iconicity is now widely acknowledged to be a significant factor at many levels of linguistic structure. Digital media Over a seven-year span, Marc Davis, Brian Williams, and Golan Levin have managed to develop their own iconic visual language. The creation of their program called Media Streams was derived from a need and a desire to have a universal language when creating videos. Media accessibility is becoming easier to obtain by the day, and with this growth new development in the field is bound to happen. Media production was once limited to an elite group of individuals who spent a large portion of their time taking courses and specializing in the art. Now with the technological advancements and internet use of today, much of the skill can be learned out of your own home. As Marc Davis would say, just as the printing press was given to the users via Desktop Publishing, media production can now, also, be given to these same users. Streaming media is vastly growing and the manipulation and reconstruction of this hot trend is more than needed and necessary to keep the diversity coming. From 1991 to 1997, Marc Davis and his colleagues worked out of the Machine Understanding Group of the MIT Laboratory and the Interval Research Corporation to create their media streams program. Media Streams \\"s a system for annotating, retrieving, repurposing, and automatically assembling digital video\\". (Davis; Media Streams) The system uses a stream based, semantic representation of video content with an iconic visual language interface of hierarchically structured and searchable primitives. The goal of this system is to address the problems of annotation convergence and human-computer communication. Developing the iconic visual language was necessary to assist the computational reading and writing of representational consensual interpretations of video content in a standardized way. Illiterate, diverse languages and the like will all be able to work with this system due to its universal language. See also References Bibliography    Hinton, L., Nichols, J., and Ohala, J.J.

Metonymy () is a figure of speech in which a thing or concept is referred to by the name of something closely associated with that thing or concept. Etymology The words metonymy and metonym come from the Greek , , \\"a change of name\\", from , , \\"after, beyond\\", and , , a suffix that names figures of speech, from , or , , \\"name\\". Background Metonymy and related figures of speech are common in everyday speech and writing. Synecdoche and metalepsis are considered specific types of metonymy. Polysemy, multiple meanings of a single word or phrase, sometimes results from relations of metonymy. Both metonymy and metaphor involve the substitution of one term for another. In metaphor, this substitution is based on some specific analogy between two things, whereas in metonymy the substitution is based on some understood association or contiguity. American literary theorist Kenneth Burke considers metonymy as one of four \\"master tropes\\": metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony. He discusses them in particular ways in his book A Grammar of Motives. Whereas Roman Jakobson argued that the fundamental dichotomy in trope was between metaphor and metonymy, Burke claims that the fundamental dichotomy is between irony and synecdoche, which he also describes as the dichotomy between dialectic and representation, or again between reduction and perspective.Burke, Kenneth. (1945) A Grammar of Motives. New York: Prentice Hall Inc. pp. 503‚Äì09. In addition to its use in everyday speech, metonymy is a figure of speech in some poetry and in much rhetoric. Greek and Latin scholars of rhetoric made significant contributions to the study of metonymy. Meaning relationships Synecdoche, in which a specific part of something is used to refer to the whole, is usually understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Sometimes an absolute distinction is made between a metonymy and a synecdoche, treating metonymy as different from, rather than inclusive of, synecdoche. There is a similar problem with the terms simile and metaphor. When the distinction is made, it is the following: when \\"A\\" is used to refer to \\"B\\", it is a synecdoche if A is a component of B or if B is a component of A, and a metonym if A is commonly associated with B but not part of its whole or a whole of its part. Thus, \\"twenty thousand hungry mouths to feed\\" is a synecdoche because mouths (A) are a part of the people (B) referred to. \\"America votes\\" is also a synecdoche because America is a whole of which the people who voted are a part. On the other hand, \\"The White House said\\" is metonymy, but not synecdoche, for the president of the United States and his staff, because, although the White House is associated with the president and his staff, the building is not a part of the people. Similarly, metalepsis is closely related to and sometimes understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Metalepsis is a figure of speech in which a word or a phrase from figurative speech is used in a new context. The new figure of speech refers to an existing one. For example, in the idiom \\"lead foot\\", meaning someone who drives fast, lead is a heavy substance, and a heavy foot on the accelerator pedal would cause a vehicle to go quickly. The use of \\"lead foot\\" to describe a person follows the intermediate substitution of \\"lead\\" for \\"heavy\\". The figure of speech is a \\"metonymy of a metonymy\\". The concept of metonymy also informs the nature of polysemy, i.e., how the same phonological form (word) has different semantic mappings (meanings). If the two meanings are unrelated, as in the word pen meaning both writing instrument and enclosure, they are considered homonyms. Within logical polysemies, a large class of mappings may be considered to be a case of metonymic transfer (e.g., \\"chicken\\" for the bird, as well as its meat; \\"crown\\" for the object, as well as the institution). Other cases where the meaning is polysemous, however, may turn out to be more metaphorical, e.g., \\"eye\\" as in the \\"eye of the needle\\". =Metaphor and metonymy= Metonymy works by the contiguity (association) between two concepts, whereas the term \\"metaphor\\" is based upon their analogous similarity. When people use metonymy, they do not typically wish to transfer qualities from one referent to another as they do with metaphor. There is nothing press-like about reporters or crown-like about a monarch, but \\"the press\\" and \\"the crown\\" are both common metonyms. Some uses of figurative language may be understood as both metonymy and metaphor; for example, the relationship between \\"a crown\\" and a \\"king\\" could be interpreted metaphorically (i.e., the king, like his gold crown, could be seemingly stiff yet ultimately malleable, over-ornate, and consistently immobile). However, in the phrase \\"lands belonging to the crown\\", the word \\"crown\\" is definitely a metonymy. The reason is that monarchs by and large indeed wear a crown, physically. In other words, there is a pre-existent link between \\"crown\\" and \\"monarchy\\". On the other hand, when Ghil'ad Zuckermann argues that the Israeli language is a \\"phoenicuckoo cross with some magpie characteristics\\", he is definitely using metaphors. There is no physical link between a language and a bird. The reason the metaphors \\"phoenix\\" and \\"cuckoo\\" are used is that on the one hand hybridic \\"Israeli\\" is based on Hebrew, which, like a phoenix, rises from the ashes; and on the other hand, hybridic \\"Israeli\\" is based on Yiddish, which like a cuckoo, lays its egg in the nest of another bird, tricking it to believe that it is its own egg. Furthermore, the metaphor \\"magpie\\" is employed because, according to Zuckermann, hybridic \\"Israeli\\" displays the characteristics of a magpie, \\"stealing\\" from languages such as Arabic and English. Two examples using the term \\"fishing\\" help clarify the distinction.Example drawn from Dirven, 1996 The phrase \\"to fish pearls\\" uses metonymy, drawing from \\"fishing\\" the idea of taking things from the ocean. What is carried across from \\"fishing fish\\" to \\"fishing pearls\\" is the domain of metonymy. In contrast, the metaphorical phrase \\"fishing for information\\" transfers the concept of fishing into a new domain. If someone is \\"fishing\\" for information, we do not imagine that the person is anywhere near the ocean; rather, we transpose elements of the action of fishing (waiting, hoping to catch something that cannot be seen, probing) into a new domain (a conversation). Thus, metaphor works by presenting a target set of meanings and using them to suggest a similarity between items, actions, or events in two domains, whereas metonymy calls up or references a specific domain (here, removing items from the sea). Sometimes, metaphor and metonymy may both be at work in the same figure of speech, or one could interpret a phrase metaphorically or metonymically. For example, the phrase \\"lend me your ear\\" could be analyzed in a number of ways. One could imagine the following interpretations: *Analyze \\"ear\\" metonymically first ‚Äì \\"ear\\" means \\"attention\\" (because people use ears to pay attention to each other's speech). Now, when we hear the phrase \\"Talk to him; you have his ear\\", it symbolizes he will listen to you or that he will pay attention to you. Another phrase \\"lending an ear (attention)\\", we stretch the base meaning of \\"lend\\" (to let someone borrow an object) to include the \\"lending\\" of non-material things (attention), but, beyond this slight extension of the verb, no metaphor is at work. *Imagine the whole phrase literally ‚Äì imagine that the speaker literally borrows the listener's ear as a physical object (and the person's head with it). Then the speaker has temporary possession of the listener's ear, so the listener has granted the speaker temporary control over what the listener hears. The phrase \\"lend me your ear\\" is interpreted to metaphorically mean that the speaker wants the listener to grant the speaker temporary control over what the listener hears. *First, analyze the verb phrase \\"lend me your ear\\" metaphorically to mean \\"turn your ear in my direction,\\" since it is known that, literally lending a body part is nonsensical. Then, analyze the motion of ears metonymically ‚Äì we associate \\"turning ears\\" with \\"paying attention,\\" which is what the speaker wants the listeners to do. It is difficult to say which analysis above most closely represents the way a listener interprets the expression, and it is possible that different listeners analyse the phrase in different ways, or even in different ways at different times. Regardless, all three analyses yield the same interpretation. Thus, metaphor and metonymy, though different in their mechanism, work together seamlessly. Other examples of metonym and metaphor overlap are found in biblical literature. For example, ‚Äútongues‚Äù is a metonym for languages in 1 Cor. 12:30, and ‚Äúsleep‚Äù is a metonym for Lazarus‚Äô death in John 11:11.James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism: An Introduction (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 61. In the Hebrew Bible, ‚Äúfire‚Äù is a metonymic image for Samson‚Äôs uncontrollable rage.Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative (New York: Basic Books, 1981), 95. He snaps cords with his strength, which are likened to flax dissolved in fire (Judg. 15:14), and sets the Philistines‚Äô fields on fire (Judg. 15:4-5). =Examples= Here are some broad kinds of relationships where metonymy is frequently used: *Containment: When one thing contains another, it can frequently be used metonymically, as when \\"dish\\" is used to refer not to a plate but to the food it contains, or as when the name of a building is used to refer to the entity it contains, as when \\"the White House\\" or \\"The Pentagon\\" are used to refer to the U.S. presidential staff or the military leadership, respectively. * A physical item, place, or body part used to refer to a related concept, such as \\"the bench\\" for the judicial profession, \\"stomach\\" or \\"belly\\" for appetite or hunger, \\"mouth\\" for speech, various terms for the genitalia for sexual desire or satisfaction of said desire, being \\"in diapers\\" for infancy, \\"palate\\" for taste, \\"the altar\\" or \\"the aisle\\" for marriage, \\"hand\\" for someone's responsibility for something (\\"he had a hand in it\\"), \\"head\\" or \\"brain\\" for mind or intelligence, or \\"nose\\" for concern about someone else's affairs, (as in \\"keep your nose out of my business\\"). A reference to Timbuktu, as in \\"from here to Timbuktu,\\" usually means a place or idea is too far away or mysterious. Metonymy of objects or body parts for concepts is common in dreams.Blechner, M. J. (2018) The Mindbrain and Dreams. New York: Routledge. *Tools/instruments: Often a tool is used to signify the job it does or the person who does the job, as in the phrase \\"his Rolodex is long and valuable\\" (referring to the Rolodex instrument, which keeps contact business cards ... meaning he has a lot of contacts and knows many people). Also \\"the press\\" (referring to the printing press), or as in the proverb, \\"The pen is mightier than the sword.\\" *Product for process: This is a type of metonymy where the product of the activity stands for the activity itself. For example, in \\"The book is moving right along,\\" the book refers to the process of writing or publishing.Lakoff and Johnson 1999, p. 203 *Punctuation marks often stand metonymically for a meaning expressed by the punctuation mark. For example, \\"He's a big question mark to me\\" indicates that something is unknown.Lakoff and Johnson 1999, p. 245 In the same way, 'period' can be used to emphasise that a point is concluded or not to be challenged. *Synecdoche: A part of something is often used for the whole, as when people refer to \\"head\\" of cattle or assistants are referred to as \\"hands.\\" An example of this is the Canadian dollar, referred to as the loonie for the image of a bird on the one- dollar coin. United States one hundred-dollar bills are often referred to as \\"Bens\\", \\"Benjamins\\" or \\"Franklins\\" because they bear a portrait of Benjamin Franklin. Also, the whole of something is used for a part, as when people refer to a municipal employee as \\"the council\\" or police officers as \\"the law\\". *Toponyms: A country's capital city or some location within the city is frequently used as a metonym for the country's government, such as Washington, D.C., in the United States; Ottawa in Canada; Tokyo in Japan; New Delhi in India; Downing Street or Whitehall in the United Kingdom; and the Kremlin in Russia. Similarly, other important places, such as Wall Street, Madison Avenue, Silicon Valley, Hollywood, Vegas, and Detroit are commonly used to refer to the industries that are located there (finance, advertising, high technology, entertainment, gambling, and motor vehicles, respectively). Such usage may persist even when the industries in question have moved elsewhere, for example, Fleet Street continues to be used as a metonymy for the British national press, though it is no longer located in the physical street of that name. Places and institutions A place is often used as a metonym for a government or other official institutions, for example, Brussels for the institutions of the European Union, The Hague for the International Court of Justice or International Criminal Court, Nairobi for the government of Kenya, the White House and Capitol Hill for the executive and legislative branches, respectively, of the United States federal government, or Foggy Bottom for the U.S. State Department. A place can represent an entire industry: for instance, Wall Street is often used metonymically to describe the entire U.S. financial and corporate banking sector. Common nouns and phrases can also be metonyms: red tape can stand for bureaucracy, whether or not that bureaucracy uses actual red tape to bind documents. In Commonwealth realms, The Crown is a metonym for the state in all its aspects. In recent Israeli usage, the term \\"Balfour\\" came to refer to the Israeli Prime Minister's Residence, located on Balfour Street in Jerusalem, to all the streets around it where demonstrations frequently take place, and also to Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family who live in the residence \\"Thousands protest at Balfour, call on police not to repeat ‚Äòterror‚Äô\\" - a news item in The Jerusalem Post, August 30, 2020 Rhetoric in ancient history Western culture studied poetic language and deemed it to be rhetoric. A. Al-Sharafi supports this concept in his book Textual Metonymy, \\"Greek rhetorical scholarship at one time became entirely poetic scholarship.\\" Philosophers and rhetoricians thought that metaphors were the primary figurative language used in rhetoric. Metaphors served as a better means to attract the audience‚Äôs attention because the audience had to read between the lines in order to get an understanding of what the speaker was trying to say. Others did not think of metonymy as a good rhetorical method because metonymy did not involve symbolism. Al-Sharafi explains, \\"This is why they undermined practical and purely referential discourse because it was seen as banal and not containing anything new, strange or shocking.\\" Greek scholars contributed to the definition of metonymy. For example, Isocrates worked to define the difference between poetic language and non-poetic language by saying that, \\"Prose writers are handicapped in this regard because their discourse has to conform to the forms and terms used by the citizens and to those arguments which are precise and relevant to the subject-matter.\\" In other words, Isocrates proposes here that metaphor is a distinctive feature of poetic language because it conveys the experience of the world afresh and provides a kind of defamiliarisation in the way the citizens perceive the world. Democritus described metonymy by saying, \\"Metonymy, that is the fact that words and meaning change.\\" Aristotle discussed different definitions of metaphor, regarding one type as what we know to be metonymy today. Latin scholars also had an influence on metonymy. The treatise Rhetorica ad Herennium states metonymy as, \\"the figure which draws from an object closely akin or associated an expression suggesting the object meant, but not called by its own name.\\" The author describes the process of metonymy to us saying that we first figure out what a word means. We then figure out that word‚Äôs relationship with other words. We understand and then call the word by a name that it is associated with. \\"Perceived as such then metonymy will be a figure of speech in which there is a process of abstracting a relation of proximity between two words to the extent that one will be used in place of another.\\" Cicero viewed metonymy as more of a stylish rhetorical method and described it as being based on words, but motivated by style. Jakobson, structuralism, and realism Metonymy became important in French structuralism through the work of Roman Jakobson. In his 1956 essay \\"The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles\\", Jakobson relates metonymy to the linguistic practice of [syntagmatic] combination and to the literary practice of realism. He explains: > The primacy of the metaphoric process in the literary schools of Romanticism > and symbolism has been repeatedly acknowledged, but it is still > insufficiently realized that it is the predominance of metonymy which > underlies and actually predetermines the so-called 'realistic' trend, which > belongs to an intermediary stage between the decline of Romanticism and the > rise of symbolism and is opposed to both. Following the path of contiguous > relationships, the realistic author metonymically digresses from the plot to > the atmosphere and from the characters to the setting in space and time. He > is fond of synecdochic details. In the scene of Anna Karenina's suicide > Tolstoy's artistic attention is focused on the heroine's handbag; and in War > and Peace the synecdoches \\"hair on the upper lip\\" or \\"bare shoulders\\" are > used by the same writer to stand for the female characters to whom these > features belong. Jakobson's theories were important for Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, and others. Dreams can use metonyms.Blechner, M. J. (2018) The Mindbrain and Dreams: An Exploration of Thinking, Dreaming, and Artistic Creation. New York: Routledge. Metonyms and art Metonyms can also be wordless. For example, Roman JakobsonJakobson, R. (1971) Selected Writings: Word and Language, Vol 2. The Hague: Mouton. argued that cubist art relied heavily on nonlinguistic metonyms, while surrealist art relied more on metaphors. Lakoff and TurnerLakoff, G. and Turner, M. (1989) More than Cool Reason: A Field Guide to Poetic Metaphor. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. argued that all words are metonyms: ‚ÄúWords stand for the concepts they express.‚Äù Some artists have used actual words as metonyms in their paintings. For example, Mir√≥‚Äôs 1925 painting \\"Photo: This is the Color of My Dreams\\" has the word ‚Äúphoto‚Äù to represent the image of his dreams. This painting comes from a series of paintings called peintures-po√©sies (paintings-poems) which reflect Mir√≥‚Äôs interest in dreams and the subconsciousRowell, M. (1976) Joan Mir√≥: Peinture ‚Äì Po√©sie. Paris: √âditions de la diff√©rence. and the relationship of words, images, and thoughts. Picasso, in his 1911 painting \\"Pipe Rack and Still Life on Table\\" inserts the word ‚ÄúOcean‚Äù rather than painting an ocean: These paintings by Mir√≥ and Picasso are, in a sense, the reverse of a rebus: the word stands for the picture, instead of the picture standing for the word.

It is sometimes considered synonymous with classification (cf., Classification synonyms). Categorization and classification allow humans to organize things, objects, and ideas that exist around them and simplify their understanding of the world.McGarty, Craig, et al. ‚ÄúSocial Categorization.‚Äù International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, 2015, pp. 186‚Äì191. Categorization is something that humans and other organisms do: \\"doing the right thing with the right kind of thing.\\" The activity of categorizing things can be nonverbal or verbal. For humans, both concrete objects and abstract ideas are recognized, differentiated, and understood through categorization. Objects are usually categorized for some adaptive or pragmatic purposes. Categorization is grounded in the features that distinguish the category's members from nonmembers. Categorization is important in learning, prediction, inference, decision making, language, and many forms of organisms' interaction with their environments.  Theories  = Classical view = Classical categorization first appears in the context of Western Philosophy in the work of Plato, who, in his Statesman dialogue, introduces the approach of grouping objects based on their similar properties. This approach was further explored and systematized by Aristotle in his Categories treatise, where he analyzes the differences between classes and objects. Aristotle also applied intensively the classical categorization scheme in his approach to the classification of living beings (which uses the technique of applying successive narrowing questions such as \\"Is it an animal or vegetable?\\", \\"How many feet does it have?\\", \\"Does it have fur or feathers?\\", \\"Can it fly?\\"...), establishing this way the basis for natural taxonomy. According to the classical Aristotelian view, categories are discrete entities characterized by a set of features that are shared by their members. In analytic philosophy, these features are assumed to establish the conditions which are both necessary and sufficient conditions to capture meaning. In the classical view, categories need to be clearly defined, mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. This way, any entity in the given classification universe belongs unequivocally to one, and only one, of the proposed categories. Modern versions of classical categorization theory study how the brain learns and represents categories by detecting the features that distinguish members from nonmembers.Ashby, F. G., & Valentin, V. V. (2017). Multiple systems of perceptual category learning: Theory and cognitive tests. In: Cohen, H., & Lefebvre, C. (Eds.). (2017).Handbook of Categorization in Cognitive Science (2nd edition). Elsevier.P√©rez-Gay Ju√°rez, F., Th√©riault, C., Gregory, M., Rivas, D., Sabri, H., & Harnad, S. (2017). How and Why Does Category Learning Cause Categorical Perception? International Journal of Comparative Psychology, 30. =Conceptual clustering= Conceptual clustering is a modern variation of the classical approach of categorization, and derives from attempts to explain how knowledge is represented. In this approach, classes (clusters or entities) are generated by first formulating their conceptual descriptions and then classifying the entities according to the descriptions.Kaufman K.A. (2012) Conceptual Clustering. In: Seel N.M. (eds) Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning. Springer, Boston, MA Conceptual clustering developed mainly during the 1980s, as a machine paradigm for unsupervised learning. It is distinguished from ordinary data clustering by generating a concept description for each generated category. Categorization tasks in which category labels are provided to the learner for certain objects are referred to as supervised classification, supervised learning, or concept learning. Categorization tasks in which no labels are supplied are referred to as unsupervised classification, unsupervised learning, or data clustering. The task of supervised classification involves extracting information from the labeled examples that allows accurate prediction of class labels of future examples. This may involve the abstraction of a rule or concept relating observed object features to category labels, or it may not involve abstraction (e.g., exemplar models). The task of clustering involves recognizing inherent structure in a data set and grouping objects together by similarity into classes. It is thus a process of generating a classification structure. Conceptual clustering is closely related to fuzzy set theory, in which objects may belong to one or more groups, in varying degrees of fitness. =Prototype theory= Since the research by Eleanor Rosch and George Lakoff in the 1970s, categorization can also be viewed as the process of grouping things based on prototypes‚Äîthe idea of necessary and sufficient conditions is almost never met in categories of naturally occurring things. It has also been suggested that categorization based on prototypes is the basis for human development, and that this learning relies on learning about the world via embodiment. A cognitive approach accepts that natural categories are graded (they tend to be fuzzy at their boundaries) and inconsistent in the status of their constituent members. Systems of categories are not objectively \\"out there\\" in the world but are rooted in people's experience. Conceptual categories are not identical for different cultures, or indeed, for every individual in the same culture. Categories form part of a hierarchical structure when applied to such subjects as taxonomy in biological classification: higher level: life-form level, middle level: generic or genus level, and lower level: the species level. These can be distinguished by certain traits that put an item in its distinctive category. But even these can be arbitrary and are subject to revision. Categories at the middle level are perceptually and conceptually the more salient. The generic level of a category tends to elicit the most responses and richest images and seems to be the psychologically basic level. Typical taxonomies in zoology for example exhibit categorization at the embodied level, with similarities leading to formulation of \\"higher\\" categories, and differences leading to differentiation within categories.  Social categorization  Social categorization consists of putting human beings into groups in order to identify them based on different criteria. Categorization is a process studied by scholars in cognitive science but can also be studied as a social activity. Social categorization is different from the categorization of other things because it implies that people create categories for themselves and others as human beings. Groups can be created based on ethnicity, country of origin, religion, sexual identity, social privileges, economic privileges, etc. Various ways to sort people exist according to one's schemas. People belong to various social groups because of their ethnicity, religion, or age.Reicher, S, and N Hopkins. ‚ÄúPsychology and the End of History: a Critique and a Proposal for the Psychology of Social Categorization.‚Äù Political Psychology, vol. 22, no. 2, 2001, pp. 383‚Äì407. Social categories based on age, race, and gender are used by people when they encounter a new person. Because some of these categories refer to physical traits, they are often used automatically when people don't know each other.Liberman, Zoe, et al. ‚ÄúThe Origins of Social Categorization.‚Äù Trends In Cognitive Sciences, vol. 21, no. 7, 2017, pp. 556‚Äì568. These categories are not objective and depend on how people see the world around them. They allow people to identify themselves with similar people and to identify people who are different. They are useful in one's identity formation with the people around them. One can build their own identity by identifying themselves in a group or by rejecting another group.Bodenhausen, Galen & Kang, S.K. & Peery, D.. (2012). Social categorization and the perception of social groups. 10.4135/9781446247631.n16. Social categorization is similar to other types of categorization since it aims at simplifying the understanding of people. However, creating social categories implies that people will position themselves in relation to other groups. A hierarchy in group relations can appear as a result of social categorization. Scholars argue that the categorization process starts at a young age when children start to learn about the world and the people around them. Children learn how to know people according to categories based on similarities and differences. Social categories made by adults also impact their understanding of the world. They learn about social groups by hearing generalities about these groups from their parents. They can then develop prejudices about people as a result of these generalities. Another aspect about social categorization is mentioned by Stephen Reicher and Nick Hopkins and is related to political domination. They argue that political leaders use social categories to influence political debates. = Negative aspects = The activity of sorting people according to subjective or objective criteria can be seen as a negative process because of its tendency to lead to violence from a group to another. Indeed, similarities gather people who share common traits but differences between groups can lead to tensions and then the use of violence between those groups. The creation of social groups by people is responsible of a hierarchization of relations between groups.Tajfel, H. ‚ÄúSocial Psychology of Intergroup Relations.‚Äù Annual Review of Psychology, vol. 33, no. 1, 1982, pp. 1‚Äì39. These hierarchical relations participate in the promotion of stereotypes about people and groups, sometimes based on subjective criteria. Social categories can encourage people to associate stereotypes to groups of people. Associating stereotypes to a group, and to people who belong to this group, can lead to forms of discrimination towards people of this group.Hugenberg, Kurt, and Galen V. Bodenhausen. ‚ÄúAmbiguity in Social Categorization: The Role of Prejudice and Facial Affect in Race Categorization.‚Äù Psychological Science, vol. 15, no. 5, 2004, pp. 342‚Äì345. The perception of a group and the stereotypes associated with it have an impact on social relations and activities. Some social categories have more weight than others in society. For instance, in history and still today, the category of \\"race\\" is one of the first categories used to sort people. However, only a few categories of race are commonly used such as \\"Black\\", \\"White\\", \\"Asian\\" etc. It participates in the reduction of the multitude of ethnicities to a few categories based mostly on people's skin color.Nadine Chaurand. St√©r√©otypisation. Cat√©gorisation sociale. Dictionnaire historique et critique du racisme, PUF, 10p, 2013. ffhal-00966930 The process of sorting people creates a vision of the other as ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô, leading to the dehumanization of people. Scholars talk about intergroup relations with the concept of social identity theory developed by H. Tajfel. Indeed, in history, many examples of social categorization have led to forms of domination or violence from a dominant group to a dominated group. Periods of colonisation are examples of times when people from a group chose to dominate and control other people belonging to other groups because they considered them as inferior. Racism, discrimination and violence are consequences of social categorization and can occur because of it. When people see others as different, they tend to develop hierarchical relation with other groups. > See also: Social identity theory  Miscategorization  There cannot be categorization without the possibility of miscategorization. To do \\"the right thing with the right kind of thing.\\"Cohen & Lefebvre 2017, there has to be both a right and a wrong thing to do. Not only does a category of which \\"everything\\" is a member lead logically to the Russell paradox (\\"is it or is it not a member of itself?\\"), but without the possibility of error, there is no way to detect or define what distinguishes category members from nonmembers. An example of the absence of nonmembers is the problem of the poverty of the stimulus in language learning by the child: children learning the language do not hear or make errors in the rules of Universal Grammar (UG). Hence they never get corrected for errors in UG. Yet children's speech obeys the rules of UG, and speakers can immediately detect that something is wrong if a linguist generates (deliberately) an utterance that violates UG. Hence speakers can categorize what is UG-compliant and UG-noncompliant. Linguists have concluded from this that the rules of UG must be somehow encoded innately in the human brain.Lasnik, H., & Lidz, J. L. (2017). The Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus. In: Ian Roberts (ed.) The Oxford Handbook of Universal Grammar. Ordinary categories, however, such as \\"dogs,\\" have abundant examples of nonmembers (cats, for example). So it is possible to learn, by trial and error, with error-correction, to detect and define what distinguishes dogs from non-dogs, and hence to correctly categorize them.Burt, J. R., Torosdagli, N., Khosravan, N., RaviPrakash, H., Mortazi, A., Tissavirasingham, F., ... & Bagci, U. (2018). Deep learning beyond cats and dogs: recent advances in diagnosing breast cancer with deep neural networks British Journal of Radiology, 91(1089), 20170545. This kind of learning, called reinforcement learning in the behavioral literature and supervised learning in the computational literature, is fundamentally dependent on the possibility of error, and error-correction. Miscategorization  examples of nonmembers of the category  must always exist, not only to make the category learnable, but for the category to exist and be definable at all.

It is a term used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics, and software programming. A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users. Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working system rather than a theoretical one. In some design workflow models, creating a prototype (a process sometimes called materialization) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea. A prototype can also mean a typical example of something such as in the use of the derivation 'prototypical'. This is a useful term in identifying objects, behaviours and concepts which are considered the accepted norm and is analogous with terms such as stereotypes and archetypes. The word prototype derives from the Greek œÄœÅœâœÑœåœÑœÖœÄŒøŒΩ prototypon, \\"primitive form\\", neutral of œÄœÅœâœÑœåœÑœÖœÄŒøœÇ prototypos, \\"original, primitive\\", from œÄœÅ·ø∂œÑŒøœÇ protos, \\"first\\" and œÑœçœÄŒøœÇ typos, \\"impression\\". Basic prototype categories Prototypes explore different aspects of an intended design: * A Proof-of-Principle Prototype serves to verify some key functional aspects of the intended design, but usually does not have all the functionality of the final product. * A Working Prototype represents all or nearly all of the functionality of the final product. * A Visual Prototype represents the size and appearance, but not the functionality, of the intended design. A Form Study Prototype is a preliminary type of visual prototype in which the geometric features of a design are emphasized, with less concern for color, texture, or other aspects of the final appearance. * A User Experience Prototype represents enough of the appearance and function of the product that it can be used for user research. * A Functional Prototype captures both function and appearance of the intended design, though it may be created with different techniques and even different scale from final design. * A Paper Prototype is a printed or hand-drawn representation of the user interface of a software product. Such prototypes are commonly used for early testing of a software design, and can be part of a software walkthrough to confirm design decisions before more costly levels of design effort are expended. Differences in creating a prototype vs. a final product In general, the creation of prototypes will differ from creation of the final product in some fundamental ways: * Material: The materials that will be used in a final product may be expensive or difficult to fabricate, so prototypes may be made from different materials than the final product. In some cases, the final production materials may still be undergoing development themselves and not yet available for use in a prototype. * Process: Mass- production processes are often unsuitable for making a small number of parts, so prototypes may be made using different fabrication processes than the final product. For example, a final product that will be made by plastic injection molding will require expensive custom tooling, so a prototype for this product may be fabricated by machining or stereolithography instead. Differences in fabrication process may lead to differences in the appearance of the prototype as compared to the final product. * Verification: The final product may be subject to a number of quality assurance tests to verify conformance with drawings or specifications. These tests may involve custom inspection fixtures, statistical sampling methods, and other techniques appropriate for ongoing production of a large quantity of the final product. Prototypes are generally made with much closer individual inspection and the assumption that some adjustment or rework will be part of the fabrication process. Prototypes may also be exempted from some requirements that will apply to the final product. Engineers and prototype specialists attempt to minimize the impact of these differences on the intended role for the prototype. For example, if a visual prototype is not able to use the same materials as the final product, they will attempt to substitute materials with properties that closely simulate the intended final materials. Characteristics and limitations of prototypes Polish economy hatchback car Beskid 106 designed in the 1980s Engineers and prototyping specialists seek to understand the limitations of prototypes to exactly simulate the characteristics of their intended design. It is important to realize that by their very definition, prototypes will represent some compromise from the final production design. Due to differences in materials, processes and design fidelity, it is possible that a prototype may fail to perform acceptably whereas the production design may have been sound. A counter-intuitive idea is that prototypes may actually perform acceptably whereas the production design may be flawed since prototyping materials and processes may occasionally outperform their production counterparts. In general, it can be expected that individual prototype costs will be substantially greater than the final production costs due to inefficiencies in materials and processes. Prototypes are also used to revise the design for the purposes of reducing costs through optimization and refinement. It is possible to use prototype testing to reduce the risk that a design may not perform as intended, however prototypes generally cannot eliminate all risk. There are pragmatic and practical limitations to the ability of a prototype to match the intended final performance of the product and some allowances and engineering judgement are often required before moving forward with a production design. Building the full design is often expensive and can be time-consuming, especially when repeated several times‚Äîbuilding the full design, figuring out what the problems are and how to solve them, then building another full design. As an alternative, rapid prototyping or rapid application development techniques are used for the initial prototypes, which implement part, but not all, of the complete design. This allows designers and manufacturers to rapidly and inexpensively test the parts of the design that are most likely to have problems, solve those problems, and then build the full design. This counter-intuitive idea‚Äîthat the quickest way to build something is, first to build something else‚Äîis shared by scaffolding and the telescope rule. Engineering sciences In technology research, a technology demonstrator is a prototype serving as proof-of-concept and demonstration model for a new technology or future product, proving its viability and illustrating conceivable applications. In large development projects, a testbed is a platform and prototype development environment for rigorous experimentation and testing of new technologies, components, scientific theories and computational tools. With recent advances in computer modeling it is becoming practical to eliminate the creation of a physical prototype (except possibly at greatly reduced scales for promotional purposes), instead modeling all aspects of the final product as a computer model. An example of such a development can be seen in Boeing 787 Dreamliner, in which the first full sized physical realization is made on the series production line. Computer modeling is now being extensively used in automotive design, both for form (in the styling and aerodynamics of the vehicle) and in function‚Äîespecially for improving vehicle crashworthiness and in weight reduction to improve mileage. =Mechanical and electrical engineering= The most common use of the word prototype is a functional, although experimental, version of a non-military machine (e.g., automobiles, domestic appliances, consumer electronics) whose designers would like to have built by mass production means, as opposed to a mockup, which is an inert representation of a machine's appearance, often made of some non-durable substance. An electronics designer often builds the first prototype from breadboard or stripboard or perfboard, typically using \\"DIP\\" packages. However, more and more often the first functional prototype is built on a \\"prototype PCB\\" almost identical to the production PCB, as PCB manufacturing prices fall and as many components are not available in DIP packages, but only available in SMT packages optimized for placing on a PCB. Builders of military machines and aviation prefer the terms \\"experimental\\" and \\"service test\\". = Electronics prototyping = A simple electronic circuit prototype on a breadboard Example of prototype in optoelectronics (Texas Instruments, DLP Cinema Prototype System) In electronics, prototyping means building an actual circuit to a theoretical design to verify that it works, and to provide a physical platform for debugging it if it does not. The prototype is often constructed using techniques such as wire wrapping or using veroboard or breadboard, with the result being a circuit that is electrically identical to the design but not physically identical to the final product. Open-source tools like Fritzing exist to document electronic prototypes (especially the breadboard-based ones) and move toward physical production. Prototyping platforms such as Arduino also simplify the task of programming and interacting with a microcontroller. The developer can choose to deploy their invention as-is using the prototyping platform, or replace it with only the microcontroller chip and the circuitry that is relevant to their product. A technician can quickly build a prototype (and make additions and modifications) using these techniques, but for volume production it is much faster and usually cheaper to mass-produce custom printed circuit boards than to produce these other kinds of prototype boards. The proliferation of quick-turn PCB fabrication and assembly companies has enabled the concepts of rapid prototyping to be applied to electronic circuit design. It is now possible, even with the smallest passive components and largest fine-pitch packages, to have boards fabricated, assembled, and even tested in a matter of days. Computer programming/computer science In many programming languages, a function prototype is the declaration of a subroutine or function (and should not be confused with software prototyping). This term is rather C/C++-specific; other terms for this notion are signature, type and interface. In prototype-based programming (a form of object-oriented programming), new objects are produced by cloning existing objects, which are called prototypes. The term may also refer to the Prototype Javascript Framework. Additionally, the term may refer to the prototype design pattern. Prototype software is often referred to as alpha grade, meaning it is the first version to run. Often only a few functions are implemented, the primary focus of the alpha is to have a functional base code on to which features may be added. Once alpha grade software has most of the required features integrated into it, it becomes beta software for testing of the entire software and to adjust the program to respond correctly during situations unforeseen during development. Often the end users may not be able to provide a complete set of application objectives, detailed input, processing, or output requirements in the initial stage. After the user evaluation, another prototype will be built based on feedback from users, and again the cycle returns to customer evaluation. The cycle starts by listening to the user, followed by building or revising a mock-up, and letting the user test the mock-up, then back. There is now a new generation of tools called Application Simulation Software which help quickly simulate application before their development. Extreme programming uses iterative design to gradually add one feature at a time to the initial prototype. Continuous learning approaches within organizations or businesses may also use the concept of business or process prototypes through software models. = Prototypicality in website design = The concept of prototypicality is used to describe how much a website deviates from the expected norm, and leads to a lowering of user preference for that site's design. = Data prototyping = A data prototype is a form of functional or working prototype. The justification for its creation is usually a data migration, data integration or application implementation project and the raw materials used as input are an instance of all the relevant data which exists at the start of the project. The objectives of data prototyping are to produce: * A set of data cleansing and transformation rules which have been seen to produce data which is all fit for purpose. * A dataset which is the result of those rules being applied to an instance of the relevant raw (source) data. To achieve this, a data architect uses a graphical interface to interactively develop and execute transformation and cleansing rules using raw data. The resultant data is then evaluated and the rules refined. Beyond the obvious visual checking of the data on-screen by the data architect, the usual evaluation and validation approaches are to use Data profiling software and then to insert the resultant data into a test version of the target application and trial its use. Scale modeling A scale model of an Douglas SB2D Destroyer in a wind tunnel for testing In the field of scale modeling (which includes model railroading, vehicle modeling, airplane modeling, military modeling, etc.), a prototype is the real-world basis or source for a scale model‚Äîsuch as the real EMD GP38-2 locomotive‚Äîwhich is the prototype of Athearn's (among other manufacturers) locomotive model. Technically, any non-living object can serve as a prototype for a model, including structures, equipment, and appliances, and so on, but generally prototypes have come to mean full-size real-world vehicles including automobiles (the prototype 1957 Chevy has spawned many models), military equipment (such as M4 Shermans, a favorite among US Military modelers), railroad equipment, motor trucks, motorcycles, and space-ships (real-world such as Apollo/Saturn Vs, or the ISS). As of 2014, basic rapid prototype machines (such as 3D printers) cost about $2,000, but larger and more precise machines can cost as much as $500,000. Metrology In the science and practice of metrology, a prototype is a human-made object that is used as the standard of measurement of some physical quantity to base all measurement of that physical quantity against. Sometimes this standard object is called an artifact. In the International System of Units (SI), there remains no prototype standard since May 20, 2019. Before that date, the last prototype used was the international prototype of the kilogram, a solid platinum-iridium cylinder kept at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures) in S√®vres France (a suburb of Paris) that by definition was the mass of exactly one kilogram. Copies of this prototype are fashioned and issued to many nations to represent the national standard of the kilogram and are periodically compared to the Paris prototype. Now the kilogram is redefined in such a way that the Planck constant is prescribed a value of exactly Until 1960, the meter was defined by a platinum-iridium prototype bar with two marks on it (that were, by definition, spaced apart by one meter), the international prototype of the metre, and in 1983 the meter was redefined to be the distance in free space covered by light in 1/299,792,458 of a second (thus defining the speed of light to be 299,792,458 meters per second). Natural sciences In many sciences, from pathology to taxonomy, prototype refers to a disease, species, etc. which sets a good example for the whole category. In biology, prototype is the ancestral or primitive form of a species or other group; an archetype.prototype. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition.

Only three or four of the 22 species are reasonably well-known. Baird's beaked whales and Cuvier's beaked whales were subject to commercial exploitation, off the coast of Japan, while the northern bottlenose whale was extensively hunted in the northern part of the North Atlantic late in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Physical characteristics Blainville's beaked whale Beaked whales are moderate in size, ranging from and weighing from . Their key distinguishing feature is the presence of a 'beak', somewhat similar to many dolphins. Other distinctive features include a pair of converging grooves under the throat, and the absence of a notch in the tail fluke. Although Shepherd's beaked whale is an exception, most species have only one or two pairs of teeth, and even these do not erupt in females. Beaked whale species are often sexually dimorphic one or the other sex is significantly larger. The adult males often possess a large bulging forehead. However, aside from dentition and size, very few morphological differences exist between male and female beaked whales. Individual species are very difficult to identify in the wild, since body form varies little from one species to another. The observer must rely on often subtle differences in size, color, forehead shape, and beak length. The blubber of these whales is almost entirely (94%) composed of wax ester, a unique characteristic of this family. =Dentition= Beaked whales are unique among toothed whales in that most species only have one pair of teeth. The teeth are tusk-like, but are only visible in males, which are presumed to use these teeth in combat for females for reproductive rights. In females, the teeth do not develop and remain hidden in the gum tissues. In December 2008, researchers from the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University completed a DNA tree of 13 of 15 known species of Mesoplodon beaked whales (excluding spade-toothed whale, which was then only known from a skeletal and a few stranded specimens). Among the results of this study was the conclusion that the male's teeth are actually a secondary sexual characteristic, similar to the antlers of male deer. Each species' teeth have a characteristically unique shape. In some cases, these teeth even hinder feeding; in the strap-toothed whale, for example, the teeth curve over the upper jaw, effectively limiting the gape to a few centimeters. Females are presumed to select mates based on the shape of the teeth, because the different species are otherwise quite similar in appearance. The social structure is not well known, but sightings of single males accompanying multiple females suggest a polygynous mating system, which would considerably limit the number of males a female can choose. Taxonomy Beaked whales comprise at least 22 species of small whales in the family Ziphiidae, which is one of the least-known families of large mammals; several species have been described only in the last two decades. Six genera have been identified. The beaked whales are the second-largest family of cetaceans (after the dolphins). They were one of the first groups to diverge from the ancestral lineage. The earliest known beaked whale fossils date to the Miocene, about 15 million years ago.

Some included ancestors of giant beaked whales (Berardius), such as Microberardius and Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius) had many relatives, such as Caviziphius, Archaeoziphius, and Izikoziphius. They were probably preyed upon by predatory whales and sharks, including Carcharocles megalodon. Recently, a large fossil ziphiid sample was discovered off the South African coast, confirming the extant ziphiid diversity might just be a remnant of a higher past diversity. After studying numerous fossil skulls off the shore of South Africa, researchers discovered the absence of functional maxillary teeth in all South African fossil ziphiids, which is evidence that suction feeding had already developed in several beaked whale lineages during the Miocene. Researchers also found fossil ziphiids with robust skulls, signaling that tusks were used for male-male interactions (speculated with extant beaked whales). Ecology =Diving= Beaked whales are deep divers with extreme dive profiles. They regularly dive deeper than to echolocate for food, and these deep dives are often followed by multiple shallower dives less than 500 m. This pattern is not always followed, however. Animals have been observed spending more than an hour at or near the surface breathing. Beaked whales are often seen surfacing synchronously, but asynchronous surfacing has also been observed. In March 2014, a study by Cascadia Research revealed that Cuvier's beaked whales were recorded to dive at least 2992 m in depth, a mammalian record. Another study, published in 2020, reported a Cuvier's beaked whale making a dive that lasted 222 minutes, another mammalian record. Deep-diving mammals face a number of challenges related to extended breath-holding and hydrostatic pressure. Cetaceans and pinnipeds that prolong apnea must optimize the size and use of their oxygen stores, and they must deal with the accumulation of lactic acid due to anaerobic metabolism. Beaked whales have several anatomical adaptations to deep diving: large spleens, livers, and body shape. Most cetaceans have small spleens. However, beaked whales have much larger spleens than delphinids, and may have larger livers, as well. These anatomical traits, which are important for filtering blood, could be adaptations to deep diving. Another notable anatomical adaptation among beaked whales is a slight depression in the body wall that allows them to hold their pectoral flippers tightly against their bodies for increased streamlining. However, they are not invulnerable to the effects of diving so deep and so often. Cascadia Research shows that the deeper the whales dive, the less often they dive per day, cutting their efforts by at least 40%. The challenges of deep diving are also overcome by the unique diving physiology of beaked whales. Oxygen storage during dives is mostly achieved by blood hemoglobin and muscle myoglobin. While the whale is diving, its heart rate slows and blood flow changes. This physiological dive response ensures oxygen-sensitive tissues maintain a supply of oxygen, while those tissues tolerant to hypoxia receive less blood flow. Additionally, lung collapse obviates the exchange of lung gas with blood, likely minimizing the uptake of nitrogen by tissues. =Feeding= The throats of all beaked whales have a bilaterally paired set of grooves that are associated with their unique feeding mechanism, suction feeding. Instead of capturing prey with their teeth, beaked whales suck it into their oral cavity. Suction is aided by the throat grooves, which stretch and expand to accommodate food. Their tongues can move very freely. By suddenly retracting the tongue and distending the gular (throat) floor, pressure immediately drops within the mouth, sucking the prey in with the water. Dietary information is available from stomach contents analyses of stranded beaked whales and from whaling operations. Their preferred diet is primarily deep-water squid, but also benthic and benthopelagic fish and some crustaceans, mostly taken near the sea floor. In a recent study, gouge marks in the sea floor were interpreted to be a result of feeding activities by beaked whales. To understand the hunting and foraging behavior of beaked whales, researchers used sound and orientation recording devices on two species: Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) and Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris). These whales hunt by echolocation in deep water (where the majority of their prey is located) between about and usually catch about 30 prey per dive. Cuvier's beaked whales must forage on average at for 58 minutes and Blainville's beaked whales typically forage at deep for an average of 47 minutes. =Range and habitat= The family Ziphiidae is one of the most widespread families of cetaceans, ranging from the ice edges at both the north and south poles, to the equator in all the oceans. Specific ranges vary greatly by species, though beaked whales typically inhabit offshore waters that are at least 300 m deep. Beaked whales are known to congregate in deep waters off the edge of continental shelves, and bottom features, such as seamounts, canyons, escarpments, and oceanic islands, including the Azores and the Canary Islands, and even off the coasts of Hawaii. Life history Very little is known about the life history of beaked whales. The oldest recorded age is 84 years for a male Baird's beaked whale and 54 years for a female. For all other beaked whale species studied, the oldest recorded age is between 27 and 39 years. Sexual maturity is reached between seven and 15 years of age in Baird's beaked whales and northern bottlenose whales. Gestation varies greatly between species, lasting 17 months for Baird's beaked whales and 12 months for the northern bottlenose whale. (PDF from IWC) No data are available on their reproductive rates. Determining group size for beaked whales is difficult, due to their inconspicuous surfacing behavior. Groups of beaked whales, defined as all individuals found in the same location at the same time, have been reported as ranging from one to 100 individuals. Nevertheless, some populations' group size has been estimated from repeated observations. For example, northern and southern bottlenose whales (H. ampullatus and H. planifrons), Cuvier's beaked whales, and Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) have a reported maximum group size of 20 individuals, with the average ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 individuals. Berardius species and Longman's beaked whales (Indopacetus pacificus) are found in larger groups of up to 100 individuals. Not much information is available about group composition of beaked whales. Only three species have been studied in any detail: northern bottlenose whales, Blainville's beaked whales, and Baird's beaked whales. Female northern bottlenose whales appear to form a loose network of social partners with no obvious long-term associations. In contrast to females, some male northern bottlenose whales have been repeatedly recorded together over several years, and possibly form long-term associations. Studies of Blainville's beaked whales have revealed groups usually consist of a number of females, calves, and/or juvenile animals. These whales are assumed to live in \\"harem-like\\" groups, where several females and young are accompanied by a single male. Baird's beaked whales are known to occur in multiple male groups, and in large groups consisting of adult animals of both sexes. Arnoux‚Äôs beaked whales have also been observed to form large pods of up to 47 individuals off the Southern Ocean off the coast of Kemp Land, Antarctica. Conservation For many years, most beaked whale species were insulated from anthropogenic impacts because of their remote habitat. However, now several issues of concern include: * Studies of stranded beaked whales show rising levels of toxic chemicals in their blubber. * As a top predator, beaked whales, like raptors, are particularly vulnerable to build-up of biocontaminants. They can ingest plastic (which can be lethal). * They more frequently become trapped in trawl nets, due to the expansion of deepwater fisheries. * Decompression sickness A major conservation concern for beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) is they appear to be vulnerable to modern sonar operations, which arises from recent strandings that temporally and physically coincide with naval sonar exercises. Mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS), developed in the 1950s for submarine detection, is thought to induce panic when experienced by whales at depth. This raises their heart-rates, forcing them to attempt to rapidly ascend toward the surface in search of air. This artificially-induced rapid ascent can cause decompression. Post mortem examinations of the stranded whales in concurrence with naval exercises have reported the presence of hemorrhaging near the ears or gas and fat emboli, which could have a deleterious impact on beaked whales that is analogous to decompression sickness in humans. Gas and fat emboli have been shown to cause nervous and cardiovascular system dysfunction, respiratory distress, pain, and disorientation in both humans and animals. In the inner ear, gas embolism can cause hemorrhages, leading to disorientation or vestibular dysfunction. Breath-holding divers, like beaked whales, can develop decompression-related problems (the \\"bends\\") when they return to the surface after deep dives. This is a possible hypothesis for the mass strandings of pelagic beaked whales associated with sonar-related activities. To illustrate, a diving beaked whale may be surfacing from a deep dive and must pass vertically through varying received sound levels. Since the whale has limited remaining oxygen supplies at the end of a long dive, it probably has limited abilities to display any normal sound avoidance behavior. Instead, the whale must continue to swim towards the surface to replenish its oxygen stores. Avoiding sonar inevitably requires a change in behavior or surfacing pattern. Therefore, sonar in close proximity to groups of beaked whales has the potential to cause hemorrhaging or to disorient the animal, eventually leading to a stranding. Current research reveals two species of beaked whales are most affected by sonar: Cuvier's (Z. cavirostris) and Blainville's (M. densirostris) beaked whales. These animals have been reported as stranding in correlation with military exercises in Greece, the Bahamas, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. The livers of these animals had the most damage. In 2019, a review of evidence on the mass strandings of beaked whale linked to naval exercises where sonar was used was published. It concluded that the effects of mid-frequency active sonar are strongest on Cuvier's beaked whales but vary among individuals or populations, and the strength of their response may depend on whether the individuals had prior exposure to sonar. The report considered that the most plausible explanation of the symptoms of decompression sickness such as gas embolism found in stranded whales to be the whales' response to sonar. It noted that no more mass strandings had occurred in the Canary Islands once naval exercises where sonar was used were banned there, and recommended that the ban be extended to other areas where mass strandings continue to occur. Four species are classified by the IUCN as \\"lower risk, conservation dependent\\": Arnoux's and Baird's beaked whales, and the northern and southern bottlenose whales. The status of the remaining species is unknown, preventing classification. Captivity Beaked whales live very short lives in captivity when compared to other cetaceans such as common bottlenose dolphins and short-finned pilot whales, most surviving only a few days out of the ocean. The longest time period for a beaked whale living in captivity was 25 days. Alexander and Nicholas, two male beaked whales‚Äîtheir species unknown, though they were thought to be either Hubbs' beaked whale or Blainville's beaked whale‚Äîhad become stranded in California on 24 August 1989. They were taken to Marine World California. Both of the whales would die of pneumonia; Nicholas died on 8 September and Alexander died 10 days later. A handful of other beaked whales have been briefly kept in captivity. A juvenile female Cuvier's beaked whale was found stranded on a kelp bed off of Santa Catalina Island on February 23rd, 1956. She was taken to Marineland of the Pacific, where she was named Martha Washington. On June 16th, 1969, a Cuvier's beaked whale live stranded in St. Augustine. The whale, thought to be a male, was then transported to Marineland of Florida. It‚Äôs unknown what happened to the whale, but it was still alive on June 18th, 1969.

Thrust geometry and nomenclature Diagram of the evolution of a fault-bend fold or 'ramp anticline' above a thrust ramp, the ramp links decollements at the top of the green and yellow layers Diagram of the evolution of a fault propagation fold Development of thrust duplex by progressive failure of ramp footwall Antiformal stack of thrust imbricates proved by drilling, Brooks Range Foothills, Alaska =Reverse faults= A thrust fault is a type of reverse fault that has a dip of 45 degrees or less. If the angle of the fault plane is lower (often less than 15 degrees from the horizontal) and the displacement of the overlying block is large (often in the kilometer range) the fault is called an overthrust or overthrust fault. Erosion can remove part of the overlying block, creating a fenster (or window) ‚Äì when the underlying block is exposed only in a relatively small area. When erosion removes most of the overlying block, leaving island-like remnants resting on the lower block, the remnants are called klippen (singular klippe). =Blind thrust faults= If the fault plane terminates before it reaches the Earth's surface, it is referred to as a blind thrust fault. Because of the lack of surface evidence, blind thrust faults are difficult to detect until they rupture. The destructive 1994 quake in Northridge, California, was caused by a previously undiscovered blind thrust fault. Because of their low dip, thrusts are also difficult to appreciate in mapping, where lithological offsets are generally subtle and stratigraphic repetition is difficult to detect, especially in peneplain areas. =Fault-bend folds= Thrust faults, particularly those involved in thin-skinned style of deformation, have a so-called ramp-flat geometry. Thrusts mostly propagate along zones of weakness within a sedimentary sequence, such as mudstones or salt layers, these parts of the thrust are called decollements. If the effectiveness of the decollement becomes reduced, the thrust will tend to cut up the section to a higher stratigraphic level until it reaches another effective decollement where it can continue as bedding parallel flat. The part of the thrust linking the two flats is known as a ramp and typically forms at an angle of about 15¬∞‚Äì30¬∞ to the bedding. Continued displacement on a thrust over a ramp produces a characteristic fold geometry known as a ramp anticline or, more generally, as a fault-bend fold. =Fault-propagation folds= Fault-propagation folds form at the tip of a thrust fault where propagation along the decollement has ceased but displacement on the thrust behind the fault tip is continuing. The continuing displacement is accommodated by formation of an asymmetric anticline-syncline fold pair. As displacement continues the thrust tip starts to propagate along the axis of the syncline. Such structures are also known as tip-line folds. Eventually the propagating thrust tip may reach another effective decollement layer and a composite fold structure will develop with characteristics of both fault-bend and fault-propagation folds. =Thrust duplex= Duplexes occur where there are two decollement levels close to each other within a sedimentary sequence, such as the top and base of a relatively strong sandstone layer bounded by two relatively weak mudstone layers. When a thrust that has propagated along the lower detachment, known as the floor thrust, cuts up to the upper detachment, known as the roof thrust, it forms a ramp within the stronger layer. With continued displacement on the thrust, higher stresses are developed in the footwall of the ramp due to the bend on the fault. This may cause renewed propagation along the floor thrust until it again cuts up to join the roof thrust. Further displacement then takes place via the newly created ramp. This process may repeat many times, forming a series of fault bounded thrust slices known as imbricates or horses, each with the geometry of a fault-bend fold of small displacement. The final result is typically a lozenge shaped duplex. Most duplexes have only small displacements on the bounding faults between the horses and these dip away from the foreland. Occasionally the displacement on the individual horses is greater, such that each horse lies more or less vertically above the other, this is known as an antiformal stack or imbricate stack. If the individual displacements are greater still, then the horses have a foreland dip. Duplexing is a very efficient mechanism of accommodating shortening of the crust by thickening the section rather than by folding and deformation. Tectonic environment An example of thin-skinned deformation (thrusting) in Montana. Note that the white Madison Limestone is repeated, with one example in the foreground and another at a higher level to the upper right corner and top of the picture. Large overthrust faults occur in areas that have undergone great compressional forces. These conditions exist in the orogenic belts that result from either two continental tectonic collisions or from subduction zone accretion. The resultant compressional forces produce mountain ranges. The Himalayas, the Alps, and the Appalachians are prominent examples of compressional orogenies with numerous overthrust faults. Thrust faults occur in the foreland basin which occur marginal to orogenic belts. Here, compression does not result in appreciable mountain building, which is mostly accommodated by folding and stacking of thrusts. Instead thrust faults generally cause a thickening of the stratigraphic section. When thrusts are developed in orogens formed in previously rifted margins, inversion of the buried paleo-rifts can induce the nucleation of thrust ramps. Foreland basin thrusts also usually observe the ramp-flat geometry, with thrusts propagating within units at a very low angle \\"flats\\" (at 1‚Äì5 degrees) and then moving up- section in steeper ramps (at 5‚Äì20 degrees) where they offset stratigraphic units. Thrusts have also been detected in cratonic settings, where \\"far- foreland\\" deformation has advanced into intracontinental areas. Thrusts and duplexes are also found in accretionary wedges in the ocean trench margin of subduction zones, where oceanic sediments are scraped off the subducted plate and accumulate. Here, the accretionary wedge must thicken by up to 200% and this is achieved by stacking thrust fault upon thrust fault in a melange of disrupted rock, often with chaotic folding. Here, ramp flat geometries are not usually observed because the compressional force is at a steep angle to the sedimentary layering. History Thrust faults were unrecognised until the work of Arnold Escher von der Linth, Albert Heim and Marcel Alexandre Bertrand in the Alps working on the Glarus Thrust; Charles Lapworth, Ben Peach and John Horne working on parts of the Moine Thrust Scotland; Alfred Elis T√∂rnebohm in the Scandinavian Caledonides and R.

(1887) Report on the geological structure of a portion of the Rocky Mountains: Geol. Surv. Canada Summ. Rept., 2, p. 41. The realisation that older strata could, via faulting, be found above younger strata, was arrived at more or less independently by geologists in all these areas during the 1880s. Geikie in 1884 coined the term thrust-plane to describe this special set of faults. He wrote: > By a system of reversed faults, a group of strata is made to cover a great > breadth of ground and actually to overlie higher members of the same series. > The most extraordinary dislocations, however, are those to which for > distinction we have given the name of Thrust-planes.

The Green Revolution, or the Third Agricultural Revolution, is the set of research technology transfer initiatives occurring between 1950 and the late 1960s, that increased agricultural production worldwide, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s. The initiatives resulted in the adoption of new technologies, including High-Yielding Varieties (HYVs) of cereals, especially dwarf wheat and rice. It was associated with chemical fertilizers, agrochemicals, and controlled water-supply (usually involving irrigation) and newer methods of cultivation, including mechanization. All of these together were seen as a 'package of practices' to supersede 'traditional' technology and to be adopted as a whole. Both the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation were heavily involved in its initial development in Mexico.Wright, Angus, \\"Downslope and North: How Soil Degradation and Synthetic Pesticides Drove the Trajectory of Mexican Agriculture through the Twentieth Century\\" in Christopher R.

He is credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. The basic approach was the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers. The term \\"Green Revolution\\" was first used by William S. Gaud, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in a speech on 8 March 1968. He noted the spread of the new technologies as: > \\"These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the > makings of a new revolution.

It was on the lead of the Mexican government in 1943, under Presidential order and finance of the Mexican President Manuel √Åvila Camacho, and support of the U.S. government, the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Rockefeller Foundation. For the U.S. government, its neighbor Mexico was an important experimental case in the use of technology and scientific expertise in agriculture that became the model for international agricultural development.Wright, \\"Downslope and North\\", pp. 22-23. Mexico made a concerted effort to transform agricultural productivity, particularly with irrigated rather than dry-land cultivation in its northwest, to solve its problem of lack of food self-sufficiency.David Barkin, \\"Food Production, Consumption, and Policy\\", Encyclopedia of Mexico vol. 1, p. 494.

The technology was seen as a valuable way to feed the poor, and would relieve some pressure of the land redistribution process. In general, success of \\"Green Revolution\\" depended; on the use of machinery for cultivation and harvest, on large-scale agricultural enterprises with access to credit (often from foreign investors), government-supported infrastructure projects, and access to low- wage agricultural workers.Wright, \\"Downslope and North\\", p. 38. Mexico was the recipient of knowledge and technology of Green Revolution, and it was an active participant with financial supports from the government for agriculture and Mexican agronomists. In the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution, the government had redistributed land to peasants in some parts of the country which had broken the back of the hacienda system. During the presidency of L√°zaro C√°rdenas (1934-1940), land reform in Mexico reached its apex in the center and south of Mexico. Agricultural productivity had fallen significantly by 1940s. U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace, previously president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Secretary of Agriculture, visited Mexico who helped in uplifting the research program in Mexico that emphasized in increased productivity rather than land reform.Angus Wright, The Death of Ram√≥n Gonz√°lez: The Modern Agricultural Dilemma. 2nd ed. Austin: University of Texas Press 2005, pp. 172-77. During the administration of Manuel Avila Camacho (1940‚Äì46), the government put resources into developing new breeds of plants and partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation, and was also supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Cotter, p. 11 In 1941, a team of U.S. scientists, Richard Branfield (Cornell University), Paul C. Mangelsdorf (Harvard University), and Elvin Charles Stakman (University of Minnesota) surveyed Mexican agriculture to recommend policies and practices.E.C. Stakman, Richard Branfield, and Paul C. Mangelsdorf, Campaigns Against Hunger. Cambridge MA: Belknap Press 1967. Norman Borlaug, a key figure developing Green Revolution practices in Mexico, studied with Stakman at University of Minnesota.University of Minnesota. 2005. Locations of Norman Borlaug's research stations in the Yaqui Valley and Chapingo. Agriculture in Mexico had been a sociopolitical issue, a key factor in some regions' participation in the Mexican Revolution. It was also a technical issue enabled by a cohort of trained agronomists who advised peasants how to increase productivity.Cotter, p. 10 In the post-World War II era, the government sought development in agriculture that bettered technological aspects of agriculture in regions‚Äînot dominated by small-scale peasant cultivators. This drive for agricultural transformation would have the benefit to Mexico on self-sufficiency in food and in the political sphere during the Cold War (potentially stem unrest and the appeal of Communism). Technical aid can also be seen as serving political ends in the international sphere. In Mexico, it also served political ends separating peasant agriculture based on the ejido and considered one of the victories of the Mexican Revolution, from agribusiness that requires large- scale land ownership, irrigation, specialized seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, machinery, and a low-wage paid labor force. In 1943, the Mexican government founded the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), which became a base for international agricultural research. The government also created the Mexican Agricultural Program (MAP) to be the lead organization in raising productivity. One of their successes was in wheat production with varieties dominating wheat production as early as 1951 (70%), 1965 (80%), and 1968 (90%).Cotter, p. 233. Mexico became the showcase for extending the Green Revolution to other areas of Latin America and beyond, into Africa and Asia. New breeds of maize, beans, and wheat produced bumper crops with proper inputs (such as fertilizer and pesticides) and careful cultivation. Many Mexican farmers who had been dubious about the scientists or hostile to them (often a mutual relationship of discord) came to see the scientific approach to agriculture as worth adopting.Cotter, p. 235 The requirement for the full package of inputs of new strains of seeds, fertilizer, synthetic pesticides, and water were often not within the reach of small-scale farmers. The application of pesticides could be hazardous for farmers. Their use often damaged the local ecology, contaminating waterways and endangering the health of workers and newborns.Wright, \\"Downslope and North\\", pp. 39-41 One of the participants in the Mexican experiment, Edwin J. Wellhausen, summarized the factors leading to its initial success. These include: high yield plants with disease resistivity, adaptability, and ability to utilize fertilizers; improved use of soils, adequate fertilizers, and control of weeds and pests; and \\"a favorable ratio between the cost of fertilizers (and other investments) to the price of the produce.\\"Wellhausen, Edwin, \\"La agricultura en M√©xico\\". Ciencia y Desarrollo, vol. 1, no. 13, March-April 1977, p. 40 =In rice: IR8 and the Philippines= In 1960, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines with the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation established the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). A rice crossing between Dee-Geo-woo-gen and Peta was done at IRRI in 1962. In 1966, one of the breeding lines became a new cultivar, IR8.IRRI Early research and training results IR8 required the use of fertilizers and pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields than the traditional cultivars. Annual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades. The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century. =Start in India= In 1961, India was on the brink of mass famine. Norman Borlaug was invited to India by the adviser to the Indian minister of agriculture Dr. M. S. Swaminathan. Despite bureaucratic hurdles imposed by India's grain monopolies, the Ford Foundation and Indian government collaborated to import wheat seed from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Punjab was selected by the Indian government to be the first site to try the new crops because of its reliable water supply and a history of agricultural success. India began its own Green Revolution program of plant breeding, irrigation development, and financing of agrochemicals. India soon adopted IR8 ‚Äì a semi- dwarf rice variety developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) that could produce more grains of rice per plant when grown with certain fertilizers and irrigation. In 1968, Indian agronomist S.K. De Datta published his findings that IR8 rice yielded about 5 tons per hectare with no fertilizer, and almost 10 tons per hectare under optimal conditions. This was 10 times the yield of traditional rice. IR8 was a success throughout Asia, and dubbed the \\"Miracle Rice\\". IR8 was also developed into Semi-dwarf IR36. Wheat yields in least developed countries since 1961, in kilograms per hectare. In the 1960s, rice yields in India were about two tons per hectare; by the mid-1990s, they had risen to six tons per hectare. In the 1970s, rice cost about $550 a ton; in 2001, it cost under $200 a ton. India became one of the world's most successful rice producers, and is now a major rice exporter, shipping nearly 4.5 million tons in 2006. =Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ‚Äì CGIAR= In 1970, foundation officials proposed a worldwide network of agricultural research centers under a permanent secretariat. This was further supported and developed by the World Bank; on 19 May 1971, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) was established. co-sponsored by the FAO, IFAD and UNDP. CGIAR has added many research centers throughout the world. CGIAR has responded, at least in part, to criticisms of Green Revolution methodologies. This began in the 1980s, and mainly was a result of pressure from donor organizations. Methods like Agroecosystem Analysis and Farming System Research have been adopted to gain a more holistic view of agriculture. =Brazil's agricultural revolution= Brazil's vast inland cerrado region was regarded as unfit for farming before the 1960s because the soil was too acidic and poor in nutrients, according to Norman Borlaug. However, from the 1960s, vast quantities of lime (pulverised chalk or limestone) were poured on the soil to reduce acidity. The effort went on for decades; by the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tonnes of lime were being spread on Brazilian fields each year. The quantity rose to 25 million tonnes in 2003 and 2004, equalling around five tonnes of lime per hectare. As a result, Brazil has become the world's second biggest soybean exporter. Soybeans are also widely used in animal feed, and the large volume of soy produced in Brazil has contributed to Brazil's rise to become the biggest exporter of beef and poultry in the world.The Economist. Brazilian agriculture: The miracle of the cerrado. August 26, 2010. http://www.economist.com/node/16886442 Several parallels can also be found in Argentina's boom in soybean production as well. =Problems in Africa= There have been numerous attempts to introduce the successful concepts from the Mexican and Indian projects into Africa. These programs have generally been less successful. Reasons cited include widespread corruption, insecurity, a lack of infrastructure, and a general lack of will on the part of the governments. Yet environmental factors, such as the availability of water for irrigation, the high diversity in slope and soil types in one given area are also reasons why the Green Revolution is not so successful in Africa. A recent program in western Africa is attempting to introduce a new high- yielding 'family' of rice varieties known as \\"New Rice for Africa\\" (NERICA). NERICA varieties yield about 30% more rice under normal conditions, and can double yields with small amounts of fertilizer and very basic irrigation. However, the program has been beset by problems getting the rice into the hands of farmers, and to date the only success has been in Guinea, where it currently accounts for 16% of rice cultivation. After a famine in 2001 and years of chronic hunger and poverty, in 2005 the small African country of Malawi launched the \\"Agricultural Input Subsidy Program\\" by which vouchers are given to smallholder farmers to buy subsidized nitrogen fertilizer and maize seeds. Within its first year, the program was reported to have had extreme success, producing the largest maize harvest of the country's history, enough to feed the country with tons of maize left over. The program has advanced yearly ever since. Various sources claim that the program has been an unusual success, hailing it as a \\"miracle\\".Malawi Miracle article on the BBC website. According to the UN website on Malawi the program was highly effective. This website highlights the women farmers program. The claims of success are substantiated by Malawi government claims at Malawi National Statistics Organization site . The international WaterAid organisation seems to contradict these facts with its report on plans from 2005‚Äì2010. Similarly, the Major League Gaming reported that Malawi had noted problems including lack of transparency and administrative difficulties. This follows with a recent (2010) Malawi newspaper tells of UN report with Malawi one of the lowest on the UN list of developing states, confirmed by this UN World Food Program report. Another report from the Institute for Security Studies from 2005, showed corruption still prevailing in Malawi at that time. Agricultural production and food security =Technologies= New varieties of wheat and other grains were instrumental to the green revolution. The Green Revolution spread technologies that already existed, but had not been widely implemented outside industrialized nations. Two kinds of technologies were used in the Green Revolution and aim at cultivation and breeding area respectively. The technologies in cultivation are targeted at providing excellent growing conditions, which included modern irrigation projects, pesticides, and synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. The breeding technologies aimed at improving crop varieties developed through the conventional, science-based methods available at the time. These technologies included hybrids, combining modern genetics with selections.  High-Yielding Varieties  The novel technological development of the Green Revolution was the production of novel wheat cultivars. Agronomists bred cultivars of maize, wheat, and rice that are the generally referred to as HYVs or \\"high-yielding varieties\\". HYVs have higher nitrogen-absorbing potential than other varieties. Since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge, or fall over before harvest, semi-dwarfing genes were bred into their genomes. A Japanese dwarf wheat cultivar Norin 10 developed by Japanese agronomist Gonjiro Inazuka, which was sent to Orville Vogel at Washington State University by Cecil Salmon, was instrumental in developing Green Revolution wheat cultivars. IR8, the first widely implemented HYV rice to be developed by IRRI, was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named \\"Peta\\" and a Chinese variety named \\"Dee-geo-woo-gen\\". In the 1960s, when a food crisis happened in Asia, the spread of HYV rice was aggravated intensely. Dr. Norman Borlaug, who is usually recognized as the \\"Father of the Green Revolution\\", bred rust- resistant cultivars which have strong and firm stems, preventing them from falling over under extreme weather at high levels of fertilization. CIMMYT(Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y TrigoInternational Center for Maize and Wheat Improvements) conducted these breeding programs and helped spread high-yielding varieties in Mexico and countries in Asia like India and Pakistan. These programs successfully led the harvest double in these countries. Plant scientists figured out several parameters related to the high yield and identified the related genes which control the plant height and tiller number. With advances in molecular genetics, the mutant genes responsible for Arabidopsis thaliana genes (GA 20-oxidase, ga1, ga1-3), wheat reduced-height genes (Rht) and a rice semidwarf gene (sd1) were cloned. These were identified as gibberellin biosynthesis genes or cellular signaling component genes. Stem growth in the mutant background is significantly reduced leading to the dwarf phenotype. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. HYVs significantly outperform traditional varieties in the presence of adequate irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers. In the absence of these inputs, traditional varieties may outperform HYVs. Therefore, several authors have challenged the apparent superiority of HYVs not only compared to the traditional varieties alone, but by contrasting the monocultural system associated with HYVs with the polycultural system associated with traditional ones. =Production increases= Cereal production more than doubled in developing nations between the years 1961‚Äì1985. Yields of rice, maize, and wheat increased steadily during that period. The production increases can be attributed roughly equally to irrigation, fertilizer, and seed development, at least in the case of Asian rice. While agricultural output increased as a result of the Green Revolution, the energy input to produce a crop has increased faster, Alt URL so that the ratio of crops produced to energy input has decreased over time. Green Revolution techniques also heavily rely on agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and defoliants; which, as of 2014, rely on or are derived from crude oil, making agriculture increasingly reliant on crude oil extraction. Proponents of the Peak Oil theory fear that a future decline in oil and gas production would lead to a decline in food production or even a Malthusian catastrophe. World population 1950‚Äì2010 =Effects on food security= The effects of the Green Revolution on global food security are difficult to assess because of the complexities involved in food systems. The world population has grown by about five billionurl=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/ since the beginning of the Green Revolution and many believe that, without the Revolution, there would have been greater famine and malnutrition. India saw annual wheat production rise from 10 million tons in the 1960s to 73 million in 2006. The average person in the developing world consumes roughly 25% more calories per day now than before the Green Revolution. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by about 160%. The production increases fostered by the Green Revolution are often credited with having helped to avoid widespread famine, and for feeding billions of people.\\"Save and Grow farming model launched by FAO\\". Food and Agriculture Organization. There are also claims that the Green Revolution has decreased food security for a large number of people. One claim involves the shift of subsistence-oriented cropland to cropland oriented towards production of grain for export or animal feed. For example, the Green Revolution replaced much of the land used for pulses that fed Indian peasants for wheat, which did not make up a large portion of the peasant diet. =Food security= Malthusian criticism Some criticisms generally involve some variation of the Malthusian principle of population. Such concerns often revolve around the idea that the Green Revolution is unsustainable, and argue that humanity is now in a state of overpopulation or overshoot with regards to the sustainable carrying capacity and ecological demands on the Earth. Although 36 million people die each year as a direct or indirect result of hunger and poor nutrition,Mortality statistics w/references in Wikipedia article on hunger. Malthus's more extreme predictions have frequently failed to materialize. In 1798 Thomas Malthus made his prediction of impending famine. The world's population had doubled by 1923 and doubled again by 1973 without fulfilling Malthus's prediction. Malthusian Paul R. Ehrlich, in his 1968 book The Population Bomb, said that \\"India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980\\" and \\"Hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs.\\" Ehrlich's warnings failed to materialize when India became self-sustaining in cereal production in 1974 (six years later) as a result of the introduction of Norman Borlaug's dwarf wheat varieties. However, Borlaug was well aware of the implications of population growth. In his Nobel lecture he repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of population. \\"The green revolution has won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only. Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the \\"Population Monster\\"...Since man is potentially a rational being, however, I am confident that within the next two decades he will recognize the self-destructive course he steers along the road of irresponsible population growth...\\" M. King Hubbert's prediction of world petroleum production rates. Modern agriculture is largely reliant on petroleum energy.\\"World oil supplies are set to run out faster than expected, warn scientists\\". The Independent. June 14, 2007. Famine To some modern Western sociologists and writers, increasing food production is not synonymous with increasing food security, and is only part of a larger equation. For example, Harvard professor Amartya Sen wrote that large historic famines were not caused by decreases in food supply, but by socioeconomic dynamics and a failure of public action.Drez√© and Sen 1991 Economist Peter Bowbrick disputes Sen's theory, arguing that Sen relies on inconsistent arguments and contradicts available information, including sources that Sen himself cited. Bowbrick further argues that Sen's views coincide with that of the Bengal government at the time of the Bengal famine of 1943, and the policies Sen advocates failed to relieve the famine. Quality of diet Some have challenged the value of the increased food production of Green Revolution agriculture. Miguel A. Altieri, (a pioneer of agroecology and peasant- advocate), writes that the comparison between traditional systems of agriculture and Green Revolution agriculture has been unfair, because Green Revolution agriculture produces monocultures of cereal grains, while traditional agriculture usually incorporates polycultures. These monoculture crops are often used for export, feed for animals, or conversion into biofuel. According to Emile Frison of Bioversity International, the Green Revolution has also led to a change in dietary habits, as fewer people are affected by hunger and die from starvation, but many are affected by malnutrition such as iron or vitamin-A deficiencies. Frison further asserts that almost 60% of yearly deaths of children under age five in developing countries are related to malnutrition. The strategies developed by the Green Revolution focused on fending off starvation and was very successful in raising overall yields of cereal grains, but did not give sufficient relevance to nutritional quality. High yield-cereal crops have low quality proteins, with essential amino acid deficiencies, are high in carbohydrates, and lack balanced essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and other quality factors. High-yield rice (HYR), introduced since 1964 to poverty-ridden Asian countries, such as the Philippines, was found to have inferior flavor and be more glutinous and less savory than their native varieties. This caused its price to be lower than the average market value. In the Philippines the introduction of heavy pesticides to rice production, in the early part of the Green Revolution, poisoned and killed off fish and weedy green vegetables that traditionally coexisted in rice paddies. These were nutritious food sources for many poor Filipino farmers prior to the introduction of pesticides, further impacting the diets of locals.

In countries such as India, Mexico, and the Philippines, technological solutions were sought as an alternative to expanding agrarian reform initiatives, the latter of which were often linked to socialist politics. =Socioeconomic impacts= The transition from traditional agriculture, in which inputs were generated on-farm, to Green Revolution agriculture, which required the purchase of inputs, led to the widespread establishment of rural credit institutions. Smaller farmers often went into debt, which in many cases resulted in a loss of their farmland. The increased level of mechanization on larger farms made possible by the Green Revolution removed a large source of employment from the rural economy. The new economic difficulties of smallholder farmers and landless farm workers led to increased rural-urban migration. The increase in food production led to cheaper food for urban dwellers, and the increase in urban population increased the potential for industrialization. According to a 2018 paper, a 10 percent increase in the use of high-yielding crop varieties in developing countries in the period 1960‚Äì2000 led to increases in GDP per capita of approximately 15 percent. =Environmental impact= Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the green revolution. Biodiversity The spread of Green Revolution agriculture affected both agricultural biodiversity (or agrodiversity) and wild biodiversity. There is little disagreement that the Green Revolution acted to reduce agricultural biodiversity, as it relied on just a few high-yield varieties of each crop. This has led to concerns about the susceptibility of a food supply to pathogens that cannot be controlled by agrochemicals, as well as the permanent loss of many valuable genetic traits bred into traditional varieties over thousands of years. To address these concerns, massive seed banks such as Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research‚Äôs (CGIAR) International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (now Bioversity International) have been established (see Svalbard Global Seed Vault). There are varying opinions about the effect of the Green Revolution on wild biodiversity. One hypothesis speculates that by increasing production per unit of land area, agriculture will not need to expand into new, uncultivated areas to feed a growing human population. However, land degradation and soil nutrients depletion have forced farmers to clear up formerly forested areas in order to keep up with production. A counter-hypothesis speculates that biodiversity was sacrificed because traditional systems of agriculture that were displaced sometimes incorporated practices to preserve wild biodiversity, and because the Green Revolution expanded agricultural development into new areas where it was once unprofitable or too arid. For example, the development of wheat varieties tolerant to acid soil conditions with high aluminium content permitted the introduction of agriculture in sensitive Brazilian ecosystems such as Cerrado semi-humid tropical savanna and Amazon rainforest in the geoeconomic macroregions of Centro-Sul and Amaz√¥nia. Before the Green Revolution, other Brazilian ecosystems were also significantly damaged by human activity, such as the once 1st or 2nd main contributor to Brazilian megadiversity Atlantic Rainforest (above 85% of deforestation in the 1980s, about 95% after the 2010s) and the important xeric shrublands called Caatinga mainly in Northeastern Brazil (about 40% in the 1980s, about 50% after the 2010s ‚Äì deforestation of the Caatinga biome is generally associated with greater risks of desertification). This also caused many animal species to suffer due to their damaged habitats. Nevertheless, the world community has clearly acknowledged the negative aspects of agricultural expansion as the 1992 Rio Treaty, signed by 189 nations, has generated numerous national Biodiversity Action Plans which assign significant biodiversity loss to agriculture's expansion into new domains. The Green Revolution has been criticized for an agricultural model which relied on a few staple and market profitable crops, and pursuing a model which limited the biodiversity of Mexico. One of the critics against these techniques and the Green Revolution as a whole was Carl O. Sauer, a geography professor at the University of California, Berkeley. According to Sauer these techniques of plant breeding would result in negative effects on the country's resources, and the culture: > \\"A good aggressive bunch of American agronomists and plant breeders could > ruin the native resources for good and all by pushing their American > commercial stocks... And Mexican agriculture cannot be pointed toward > standardization on a few commercial types without upsetting native economy > and culture hopelessly... Unless the Americans understand that, they'd > better keep out of this country entirely. That must be approached from an > appreciation of native economies as being basically sound\\".  Greenhouse gas emissions  According to a study published in 2013 in PNAS, in the absence of the crop germplasm improvement associated with the Green Revolution, greenhouse gas emissions would have been 5.2‚Äì7.4 Gt higher than observed in 1965‚Äì2004. High yield agriculture has dramatic effects on the amount of carbon cycling in the atmosphere. The way in which farms are grown, in tandem with the seasonal carbon cycling of various crops, could alter the impact carbon in the atmosphere has on global warming. Wheat, rice, and soybean crops account for a significant amount of the increase in carbon in the atmosphere over the last 50 years. Dependence on non-renewable resources Most high intensity agricultural production is highly reliant on non-renewable resources. Agricultural machinery and transport, as well as the production of pesticides and nitrates all depend on fossil fuels. Nitrogen fertilizer is a direct fossil fuel product processed primarily from natural gas. It is estimated that no more than 3.7 billion people of the current world population could be fed without this single fossil fuel agricultural input. Moreover, the essential mineral nutrient phosphorus is often a limiting factor in crop cultivation, while phosphorus mines are rapidly being depleted worldwide. The failure to depart from these non-sustainable agricultural production methods could potentially lead to a large scale collapse of the current system of intensive food production within this century. =Health impact= The consumption of the pesticides used to kill pests by humans in some cases may be increasing the likelihood of cancer in some of the rural villages using them. Poor farming practices including non-compliance to usage of masks and over-usage of the chemicals compound this situation. In 1989, WHO and UNEP estimated that there were around 1 million human pesticide poisonings annually. Some 20,000 (mostly in developing countries) ended in death, as a result of poor labeling, loose safety standards etc. Pesticides and cancer Contradictory epidemiologic studies in humans have linked phenoxy acid herbicides or contaminants in them with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and malignant lymphoma, organochlorine insecticides with STS, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), leukemia, and, less consistently, with cancers of the lung and breast, organophosphorous compounds with NHL and leukemia, and triazine herbicides with ovarian cancer. Punjab case The Indian state of Punjab pioneered green revolution among the other states transforming India into a food-surplus country. Section: \\"The Green Revolution\\", pp. 17‚Äì20. Environmental activist Vandana Shiva has written extensively about the social, political and economic impacts of the Green Revolution in Punjab. According to Shiva, the Green Revolution's reliance on heavy use of chemical inputs and monocultures has resulted in water scarcity, vulnerability to pests, and incidents of violent conflict and social marginalization. A Greenpeace Research Laboratories investigation of 50 villages in Muktsar, Bathinda and Ludhiana districts revealed that twenty percent of the sampled wells had nitrate levels above WHO limits for drinking water. The 2009 study linked the nitrate pollution with high use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Norman Borlaug's response to criticism Borlaug dismissed certain claims of critics, but also cautioned, \\"There are no miracles in agricultural production. Nor is there such a thing as a miracle variety of wheat, rice, or maize which can serve as an elixir to cure all ills of a stagnant, traditional agriculture.\\" Of environmental lobbyists, he said: > some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of > the earth, but many of them are elitists. They've never experienced the > physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office > suites in Washington or Brussels...If they lived just one month amid the > misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they'd be crying > out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that > fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things. The New Green Revolution Although the Green Revolution has been able to improve agricultural output in some regions in the world, there was and is still room for improvement. As a result, many organizations continue to invent new ways to improve the techniques already used in the Green Revolution. Frequently quoted inventions are the System of Rice Intensification,Norman Uphoff for SciDevNet 16 October 2013 New approaches are needed for another Green Revolution marker-assisted selection,Tom Chivers for The Daily Telegraph.

Rome 13‚Äì17 November 1996 Current challenges for nations trying to modernize their agriculture include closing the urban-rural income gap, integration of smallholders into value chains, and maintaining competitiveness in the market. However, in low-income countries, chronic problems such as poverty and hunger cause agricultural modernization efforts to be constrained. It is projected that global populations by 2050 will increase by one-third and as such will require a 70% increase in the production of food. Therefore, the Second Green Revolution will likely focus on improving tolerances to pests and disease in addition to technological input use efficiency.

It was convened to discuss [sustainable development] organizations, 10 years after the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. (It was therefore also informally nicknamed \\"Rio+10\\".) Declarations The Johannesburg Declaration was the main outcome of the Summit; however, there were several other international agreements. It laid out the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation as an action plan.https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/WSSD_POI_PD/English/POIToc.htm Agreements Johannesburg, 27 August: agreement was made to restore the world's depleted fisheries for 2015. It was agreed to by negotiators at the World Summit. Instead of new agreements between governments, the Earth Summit was organized mostly around almost 300 \\"partnership initiatives\\" known as Type II, as opposed to Type I Partnerships which are the more classic outcome of international treaties. These were to be the key means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. These are kept in a database of Partnerships for Sustainable Development. U.S. participation The absence of the United States rendered the summit partially impotent. George W. Bush boycotted the summit and did not attend. Except for a brief appearance by Colin Powell, who hurriedly addressed the closing stages of the conference while his airplane taxied on the runway of Johannesburg International, the US government did not send a delegation, earning Bush praise in a letter from conservative organizations such as Americans for Tax Reform, American Enterprise Institute, and Competitive Enterprise Institute. History The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, was first held in Stockholm, Sweden, in June 1972, and marked the emergence of international environmental law. The Declaration on the Human Environment also known as the Stockholm Declaration set out the principles for various international environmental issues, including human rights, natural resource management, pollution prevention and the relationship between the environment and development. The conference also led to the creation of the United Nations Environment Programme. The Brundtland Commission set up by Gro Harlem Brundtland, the pioneer of sustainable development, provided the momentum for first Earth Summit 1992 - the United Nations Conference on Environmental Development (UNCED), that was also headed by Maurice Strong, who had been a prominent member of the Brundtland Commission - and also for Agenda 21. South Africa's first National Conference on Environment and Development entitled, \\"Ecologise Politics, Politicise Ecology\\" was held at the University of the Western Cape in conjunction with the Cape Town Ecology Group and the Western Cape Branch of the World Conference on Religion and Peace in 1991. Prominent persons involved in this conference were Ebrahim Rasool, Cheryl Carolus, Faried Esack, and Julia Martin. The initial informal discussions on a possible new Summit in 2002 were held in February 1998 and hosted by Derek Osborn who co-chaired the preparatory meetings for Rio+5 and Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future. A set of 10 governments started working informally to start putting together the possible agenda for a Summit. the non-papers produced in 1998 and 1999 ensured that when the UN Commission met in 2000 it could agree to host another Summit in 2002.

Born as a slave, he was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1900 for his gallantry in saving the regimental colors (American flag) during the Battle of Fort Wagner in 1863. The action for which he received the Medal of Honor preceded that of any other African American Medal of Honor recipient; however, his medal was actually one of the very last to be awarded for Civil War service. African Americans received the Medal of Honor as early as April 1865. Biography William Harvey Carney was born as a slave in Norfolk, Virginia, on February 29, 1840. How he made his way to freedom is not certain. According to most accounts, he escaped through the Underground Railroad, and joined his father in Massachusetts. Other members of their family were freed by purchase or by the death of their master. = Civil War = Carney joined the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry in March 1863and was later promoted to sergeant due to his heroism and actions during the battle of Fort Wagner. He took part in the July 18, 1863, assault on Fort Wagner in Charleston, South Carolina. His actions there ultimately earned him the Medal of Honor. When the color guard was killed, Carney retrieved the U.S. flag and marched forward with it, despite serious wounds. When the Union troops were forced to retreat under fire, he struggled back across the battlefield, eventually returning to his own lines and turning over the colors to another survivor of the 54th, saying, \\"Boys, I only did my duty; the old flag never touched the ground!\\" He received an honorable discharge due to disability from his wounds in June 1864. =Later= Carney after the war, wearing his Medal of Honor After his discharge, Carney returned to New Bedford, Massachusetts, and took a job maintaining the city's streetlights. He then delivered mail for thirty-two years. He was a founding vice president of the New Bedford Branch 18 of the National Association of Letter Carriers, in 1890. He married Susannah Williams, and they had a daughter, Clara Heronia. He spent a few years in California, then returned again in 1869. Carney received his Medal of Honor on May 23, 1900, nearly 37 years after the events at Fort Wagner (more than half of such awards from the Civil War were presented 20 or more years after the fact). Twenty African American men received the medal before him, but because his battle actions happened earlier than the others, some have incorrectly cited him as the first to receive the medal. His citation reads > When the color sergeant was shot down, this soldier grasped the flag, led > the way to the parapet, and planted the colors thereon. When the troops fell > back he brought off the flag, under a fierce fire in which he was twice > severely wounded. In 1901, shortly after his medal was awarded, a song was published about his daring exploits: \\"Boys the Old Flag Never Touched the Ground\\". Carney died at the Boston City Hospital on December 9, 1908, of complications from an elevator accident at the Massachusetts State House, where he worked for the Department of State. His body lay in repose for one day at the undertaking rooms of Walden Banks, 142 Lenox Street, at the wish of his wife and daughter. He was buried in the family plot at Oak Grove Cemetery in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Engraved on his tombstone is an image of the Medal of Honor.South Coast Today Other honors A New Bedford, Massachusetts, elementary school was named in his honor, and his New Bedford home at 128 Mill Street is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. His statue, along with Private Milton L. Olive, is seen on the African-American Medal of Honor Recipients Memorial in Wilmington, Delaware. In 2015, Carney was honored as one of the Library of Virginia's \\"Strong Men & Women in Virginia History\\" because of his actions during the Civil War. Carney's regiment is represented in the Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts Fifty-Fourth Regiment, located on the Boston Common and designed by Augustus Saint Gaudens.

The modern use of the term applies mostly to African Americans and West Indians who are descended from enslaved Africans who retain their name given to their ancestors by the enslavers. Ancient Rome In Rome slaves were given a single name by their owner. A slave who was freed might keep his or her slave name and adopt the former owner's name as a praenomen and nomen. As an example, one historian says that \\"a man named Publius Larcius freed a male slave named Nicia, who was then called Publius Larcius Nicia.\\"Roman Nomenclature at vroma.org Historian Harold Whetstone Johnston writes of instances in which a slave's former owner chose to ignore custom and simply chose a name for the freedman.Johnson, Harold Whetstone; Johnston, Mary; Names of Freedmen; 1903, 1932; forumromanum.org African Americans A number of African-Americans and Afro-Caribbeans have changed their names out of the belief that the names they were given at birth were slave names. An individual's name change often coincides with a religious conversion (Muhammad Ali changed his name from Cassius Clay, Malcolm X from Malcolm Little, and Louis Farrakhan changed his from Louis Eugene Walcott, for example) or involvement with the black nationalist movement, in this later case usually adopting names of African origin (e.g., Amiri Baraka and Assata Shakur).Deburg, William L.

Internationally Nygaard is acknowledged as the co-inventor of object-oriented programming and the programming language Simula with Ole-Johan Dahl in the 1960s. Nygaard and Dahl received the 2001 A. M. Turing Award for their contribution to computer science. Early life and career Nygaard was born in Oslo and received his master's degree in mathematics at the University of Oslo in 1956. His thesis on abstract probability theory was entitled \\"Theoretical Aspects of Monte Carlo methods\\". Nygaard worked full-time at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment from 1948 to 1960 in computing and programming (1948‚Äì1954) and operational research (1952‚Äì1960). From 1957 to 1960 he was head of the first operations research groups in the Norwegian defense establishment. He was cofounder and first chairman of the Norwegian Operational Research Society (1959‚Äì1964). In 1960 he was hired by the Norwegian Computing Center (NCC), responsible for building up the NCC as a research institute in the 1960s, becoming its Director of Research in 1962. Object-oriented programming Together with Ole-Johan Dahl he developed Simula I (1961‚Äì1965) and SIMULA-67 the first object-oriented programming languages, introducing core concepts of object-oriented programming languages: objects, classes, inheritance, virtual quantities and multi-threaded (quasi-parallel) program execution. In 2004, AITO established an annual prize in the name of Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard to honor their pioneering work on object-orientation. The AITO Dahl- Nygaard prize is awarded annually to two individuals that have made significant technical contributions to the field of Object-Orientation. The work should be in the spirit of the pioneer conceptual and/or implementation work of Dahl and Nygaard which shaped our present view of object-oriented programming. The prize is presented each year at the ECOOP conference. The prize consists of two awards given to a senior and to a junior professional. He conducted research for Norwegian trade unions on planning, control, and data processing, all evaluated in light of the objectives of organised labour ([1971‚Äì1973), working together with Olav Terje Bergo). His other research and development work included the social impact of computer technology and the general system description language DELTA (1973‚Äì1975), working with Erik Holbaek-Hanssen and Petter Haandlykken). Nygaard was a professor in Aarhus, Denmark (1975‚Äì1976) and then became professor emeritus in Oslo (part-time from 1977, full-time 1984‚Äì1996). His work in Aarhus and Oslo included research and education in system development and the social impact of computer technology, and became the foundation of the Scandinavian School in System Development, which is closely linked to the field of participatory design. Beginning in 1976, he was engaged in the development and (since 1986) the implementation of the general object-oriented programming language BETA (together with Bent Bruun Kristensen, Ole Lehrmann Madsen and Birger Moeller-Pedersen). The language is now available on a wide range of computers. Later career Nygaard was in the first half of the 1980s chairman of the steering committee of the Scandinavian research program SYDPOL (System Development and Profession Oriented Languages), coordinating research and supporting working groups in system development, language research and artificial intelligence. Also in the 1980s, he was chairman of the steering committee for the Cost-13 (European Common Market Commission)-financed research project on the extensions of profession-oriented languages necessary when artificial intelligence and information technology are becoming part of professional work. Nygaard's research from 1995 to 1999 was related to distributed systems. He was the leader of General Object-Oriented Distributed Systems (GOODS), a three-year Norwegian Research Council-supported project starting in 1997, aiming at enriching object-oriented languages and system development methods by new basic concepts that make it possible to describe the relation between layered and/or distributed programs and the computer hardware and people carrying out these programs. The GOODS team also included Haakon Bryhni, Dag Sj√∏berg, and Ole Sm√∏rdal. Nygaard's final research interests were studies of the introductory teaching of programming, and the creation of a process-oriented conceptual platform for informatics. These subjects are to be developed in a new research project called COOL (Comprehensive Object-Oriented Learning) together with a number of international test sites. He was giving lectures and courses on these subjects in Norway and elsewhere. In November 1999 he became chair of an advisory committee on Broadband Communication for the Norwegian Department for Municipal and Regional Affairs. He held a part-time position at Simula Research Laboratory from 2001, when the research institute was opened. Recognition In June 1990, he received an honorary doctorate from Lund University, Sweden, and in June 1991 he became the first individual to be given an honorary doctorate by Aalborg University, Denmark. He became a member of the Norwegian Academy of Sciences. In October 1990, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility awarded him its Norbert Wiener Award for Social and Professional Responsibility. In 1999, he became together with Dahl the first to receive the Rosing Prize. This new prize is awarded by the Norwegian Data Association for exceptional professional achievements. In June 2000, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship for \\"his originating of object technology concepts\\" by the Object Management Group, the International Organization for Standardization within object-orientation. In November 2001, he and Dahl were awarded the IEEE John von Neumann Medal by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \\"For the introduction of the concepts underlying object- oriented programming through the design and implementation of SIMULA 67\\". in_memoriam_kristen In February 2002, he was given, once more together with Ole-Johan Dahl, the 2001 A. M. Turing Award by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), with the citation: \\"For ideas fundamental to the emergence of object oriented programming, through their design of the programming languages Simula I and Simula 67.\\" In August 2000, he was made Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav by the King of Norway. Other activities In 1984 and 1985, Nygaard was chairman of the Informatics Committee of the University of Oslo, and active in the design of the university's plan for developing research, education and computing and communication facilities at all faculties of the university. He was the first chairman of the Environment Protection Committee of the Norwegian Association for the Protection of Nature. He was for 10 years (in the 1970s) Norwegian representative in the OECD activities on information technology. He has been a member of the Research Committee of the Norwegian Federation of Trade Unions, and cooperated with unions in a number of countries. He was for several years engaged in running an experimental social institution trying new ways of creating humane living conditions for socially outcast alcoholics. Nygaard was active in Norwegian politics. In the mid and late 1960s he was a member of the National Executive Committee of the Norwegian Liberal Party, and chair of that party's Strategy Committee.. See in particular p. 97. He was a minor ballot candidate in the 1949 parliamentary election. During the intense political fight before the 1972 referendum on whether Norway should become a member of the European Common Market (later the European Union), he worked as coordinator for the many youth organisations that worked against membership. From 1971 to 2001, Nygaard was a member of the Labour Party, and he was a member of committees on research policies in that party. In November 1988, he became chair of the Information Committee on Norway and the EEC, in August 1990 reorganized as Nei til EF an organization disseminating information about Norway's relation to the Common Market, and coordinating the efforts to keep Norway outside. (No to European Union membership for Norway, literally \\"No to the EU\\"). In 1993, when the EEC ratified the Maastricht Treaty and became the European Union the organization changed its name to reflect this. Nei til EF became the largest political organization in Norway (145,000 members in 1994, from a population of 4 million). Nygaard worked with Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of the anti-EU Centre Party, in this campaign. In the referendum on 28 November 1994, \\"Nei til EU\\" succeeded: 52.2% of the electorate voted \\"No\\", and the voter participation was the highest ever in Norway's history 88.8%. The strategy of the campaign, insisted by Nygaard, was that it had to be for something as well as against, i.e. the Scandinavian welfare state Nygaard considered threatened by the Maastricht Agreement. He resigned as chair in 1995, and was later the chair of the organization's strategy committee and member of its Council. In 1996 and 1997, Nygaard was the coordinator of the efforts to establish The European Anti-Maastricht Movement (TEAM), a cooperative network between national organizations opposing the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU) and the Maastricht Treaty in European countries within and outside the EU. TEAM was successfully started 3 March 1997. Personal life Kristen Nygaard married Johanna Nygaard in 1951. Johanna Nygaard worked at the Norwegian Agency for Aid to Developing Countries. She specialized for a number of years in recruiting and giving administrative support to specialists working in East Africa. Johanna and Kristen Nygaard had three children and seven grandchildren. Nygaard died of a heart attack in 2002.

( ; , Kroisos; 595 BC ‚Äì date of death unknown) was the king of Lydia who, according to Herodotus, reigned for 14 years: from 560 BC until his defeat by the Persian king Cyrus the Great in 546 BC\\"Croesus\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online (sometimes given as 547 BC). Croesus was renowned for his wealth; Herodotus and Pausanias noted that his gifts were preserved at Delphi.Among them a lion of gold, which had tumbled from its perch upon a stack of ingots when the temple at Delphi burned but was preserved and displayed in the Treasury of the Corinthians, where Pausanias saw it (Pausanias 10.5.13). The temple burned in the archonship of Erxicleides, 548‚Äì47 BC. The fall of Croesus had a profound effect on the Greeks, providing a fixed point in their calendar. \\"By the fifth century at least,\\" J. A. S. Evans has remarked, \\"Croesus had become a figure of myth, who stood outside the conventional restraints of chronology.\\" examines the legend and the date 547 BC. The name of Croesus was not attested in contemporary inscriptions in Lydian language. In 2019, D. Sasseville and K. Euler published a research of Lydian coins apparently minted during his rule, where the name of the ruler was rendered as QŒªd√£ns.https://www.academia.edu/43513813/Die_Identit%C3%A4t_des_lydischen_Q%CE%BBd%C3%A3ns_und_seine_kulturgeschichtlichen_Folgen Legendary biography Aside from a poetical account of Croesus on the pyre in Bacchylides (composed for Hiero of Syracuse, who won the chariot race at Olympia in 468), there are three classical accounts of Croesus: Herodotus presents the Lydian accountsHerodotus credits his Lydian sources for the fall of Croesus in Histories 1.87. of the conversation with Solon (Histories 1.29‚Äì33), the tragedy of Croesus' son Atys (Histories 1.34‚Äì45) and the fall of Croesus (Histories 1.85‚Äì89); Xenophon instances Croesus in his panegyric fictionalized biography of Cyrus: Cyropaedia, 7.1; and Ctesias, whose accountLost: what survives is a meager epitome by Photius. is also an encomium of Cyrus. Croesus is a descendant of Gyges, of the Myrmnadae Clan, who seized power when Gyges killed Candaules after Candaules's wife found out about a conspiracy to watch her disrobe, according to Herodotus.\\"Histories, Book 1\\" = Early rule and wealth = Gold coin of Croesus, Lydian, around 550 BC, found in what is now modern Turkey Reportedly, Croesus on the death of his father Alyattes faced a rival claimant to the throne in Pantaleon, son of Alyattes by a different mother. Croesus prevailed, and a number of the opposing faction were executed, and their property confiscated.Herodotus, The Histories, (Penguin Books, Suffolk, England, 1983), I., p. 79 As soon as his reign was secure, Croesus continued his sires' wars against the Asian Greeks, bringing all the Aeolian and Ionian Settlements on the coasts of Asia-Minor under Lydian rule, from whom he exacted tribute;Herodotus, I., p. 50 However, he was willing to be friendly to European and Aegean Greeks, concluding various treaties with them, with Sparta, in particular, later in life.Herodotus, I., pp. 67, 68 Croesus is credited with issuing the first true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation, the Croeseid (following on from his father Alyattes who invented minting with electrum coins). Indeed, the invention of coinage had passed into Greek society through Hermodike II.Herodotus, I, p. 80An Encyclopedia Of World History, (Houghton Mifflin Company Boston, 1952), chap. II. Ancient History, p. 37 Hermodike II was likely one of Alyettes‚Äô wives so may have been Croesus‚Äô mother because the bull imagery on the croeseid symbolises the Hellenic Zeus ‚Äì see Europa (consort of Zeus).Grimal, Pierre (1991). The Penguin dictionary of classical mythology. Kershaw, Stephen. (Abridged) ed. London: Penguin Books. . . Zeus, through Hercules, was the divine forefather of his family line.The dynasty which preceded that of Croesus on the throne of Sardes traced their descent from Alcaeus, the son of Hercules by Omphale, Queen of Lydia, during her year of required servitude. Like his ancestor Hercules, Croesus attempted to burn himself on a pyre when the Persians captured Sardes. By emulating the Greek myth, he demonstrated he had ‚Äì or believed he had ‚Äì Greek heritage. Moreover, the first coins were quite crude and made of electrum, a naturally occurring pale yellow alloy of gold and silver. The composition of these first coins was similar to alluvial deposits found in the silt of the Pactolus river (made famous by Midas), which ran through the Lydian capital, Sardis. Later coins, including some in the British Museum, were made from gold purified by heating with common salt to remove the silver. In Greek and Persian cultures the name of Croesus became a synonym for a wealthy man. He inherited great wealth from his father who had become associated with the Midas mythology because Lydian precious metals came from the river Pactolus in which King Midas supposedly washed away his ability to turn all he touched into gold.https://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/7cEz771FSeOLptGIElaquA Aylettes‚Äô tax revenue may be the real ‚ÄòMidas touch‚Äô financing his and Croesus conquests. Croesus' wealth remained proverbial beyond classical antiquity: in English, expressions such as \\"rich as Croesus\\" or \\"richer than Croesus\\" are used to indicate great wealth to this day. The earliest known such usage in English was John Gower's in Confessio amantis (1390): Original text: Modern spelling: = Interview with Solon = Aesop in front of Croesus. Croesus showing his treasures to Solon. Frans Francken the Younger, 17th century. According to Herodotus, Croesus encountered the Greek sage Solon and showed him his enormous wealth.Herodotus 1.29-33. Croesus, secure in his own wealth and happiness, asked Solon who the happiest man in the world was, and was disappointed by Solon's response that three had been happier than Croesus: Tellus, who died fighting for his country, and the brothers Kleobis and Biton who died peacefully in their sleep after their mother prayed for their perfect happiness because they had demonstrated filial piety by drawing her to a festival in an oxcart themselves. Solon goes on to explain that Croesus cannot be the happiest man because the fickleness of fortune means that the happiness of a man's life cannot be judged until after his death. Sure enough, Croesus' hubristic happiness was reversed by the tragic deaths of his accidentally- killed son and, according to Critias, his wife's suicide at the fall of Sardis, not to mention his defeat at the hands of the Persians. The interview is in the nature of a philosophical disquisition on the subject \\"Which man is happy?\\" It is legendary rather than historical. Thus the \\"happiness\\" of Croesus is presented as a moralistic exemplum of the fickleness of Tyche, a theme that gathered strength from the fourth century, revealing its late date. The story was later retold and elaborated by Ausonius in The Masque of the Seven Sages, in the Suda (entry \\"Œú·æ∂ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ ·ΩÅ Œ¶œÅœçŒæ,\\" which adds Aesop and the Seven Sages of Greece), and by Tolstoy in his short story \\"Croesus and Fate\\". =Croesus' votive offerings to Delphi= According to Herodotus,Herodotus, 1.46‚Äì51 Croesus desired to discover which of the well known oracles of his time gave trustworthy omens. He sent ambassadors to the most important oracles ordering that on the 100th day from their departure from Sardis they should ask what the king of the Lydians, Croesus, son of Alyattes was doing on this exact date. Then on the 100th day the envoys entered the oracle of Delphi in order to ask for the omen, the Pythia answered in verse: Silver croeseid issued by King Croesus of Lydia (561‚Äì545 BC), obverse: lion and bull protomes. The envoys wrote down the answer and returned to Sardis. Croesus read all the answers brought by his envoys from all the oracles. As soon as he read the answer of the Pythia he bowed, because he was persuaded that it was the only real oracle, along with that of Amphiaraus.Herodotus, 1.49: \\"As to the reply which the Lydians received from the oracle of Amphiaraus when they had followed the due custom of the temple, I cannot say what it was, for nothing is recorded of it, except that Croesus believed that from this oracle too he had obtained a true answer.\\" Indeed, on the specific date Croesus had put pieces of a tortoise and lamb to boil together in a bronze cauldron, covered with a bronze lid. Then, Croesus wanted to thank and take on his side the oracle of Delphi. He sacrificed three thousand of all kinds of sacrificial animals. Then he lit a bonfire and burned precious objects. After the sacrifice he melted down gold and made golden blocks, each one 2.5 talents. He ordered his artists to make the copy of a lion out of pure gold, weighing ten talents. At the time of Herodotus this was situated at the Treasury of the Corinthians in Delphi, but 3.5 talents lighter, as the priests had melted down part of it. Croesus also sent along two enormous krateres (wine-mixing bowls), one made of gold and one made of silver, situated on one side and the other of the entrance to the temple of Apollo. After the fire which destroyed the temple, these krateres were transferred elsewhere: the golden one was transferred to the treasury of the Klazomenians, whereas the silver one was placed again in the vestibule of the new temple. Within this krater took place the mixing of water and wine during the Theophania. In Delphi they used to say that this one had been made by Theodorus of Samos. The votive offerings of Croesus comprised also four silver pithoi (storage jars), situated at the Treasury of the Corinthians, and two perirrhanteria (basins for purification water) made of precious metals and a statue of a woman made of gold; they said that it depicted the woman who kneaded Croesus' bread. Finally, he dedicated the pendants and belts of his wife as well as other simpler and smaller liturgical objects and a golden shield which he offered to the Archaic temple of Athena Pronaia, later on melted by the Phocians in the course of the Third Sacred War. = Death of son = According to legend, Croesus gave refuge at one point to the Phrygian prince Adrastus. Herodotus tells that Adrastus exiled himself to Lydia after accidentally killing his brother. Croesus later experienced a dream for which he took as prophecy in which Atys, his son and heir, would be killed by an iron spearhead. Taking precautions against this, Croesus kept his son from leading in military expeditions and fighting in any way. However, according to Herodotus, a wild boar began to ravage the neighboring province of Mysia, which soon begged Croesus to send a military expedition led by Atys to kill the boar. Croesus thought this would be safe for his son, as Atys would not be fighting an enemy that could throw a spear. However, he sent Adrastus with Atys as a bodyguard in case they might be waylaid by bandits on the expedition. While fighting the boar, Adrastus accidentally hit Atys with his spear, killing him. Croesus absolved Adrastus for his son's death; however, Adrastus later committed suicide.Herodotus, Histories, Book I 34‚Äì45. = Campaign against Persia and testing of oracle = Defeat of Croesus at the Battle of Thymbra, 546 BC. Croesus' uneasy relations with the Ionian Greeks obscures the larger fact that he was the last bastion of the Ionian cities against the increasing Persian power in Anatolia. He began preparing a campaign against Cyrus the Great of Persia. Before setting out, he turned to the Delphic oracle and the oracle of Amphiaraus to inquire whether he should pursue this campaign and whether he should also seek an alliance. The oracles answered, with typical ambiguity, that if Croesus attacked the Persians, he would destroy a great empire (·º¢ŒΩ œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒµœçŒ∑œÑŒ±Œπ ·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ Œ†Œ≠œÅœÉŒ±œÇ, ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑ŒΩ ·ºÄœÅœá·Ω¥ŒΩ ŒºŒπŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªœçœÉŒµŒπŒΩHerodotus, Books I‚ÄìII, ed. G. P. Goold, vol. 1, The Loeb Classical Library (London; Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; William Heinemann Ltd, 1975), p. 60.) - this would become one of the most famous oracular statements from Delphi. The oracles also advised Croesus to find out which Greek state was most powerful and to ally himself with it.Herodotus 1.53. Croesus, now feeling secure, formed an alliance with Sparta \\"L'alliance lydo-spartiate\\", in Kt√®ma, 39, 2014, pp. 271‚Äì288. in addition to those he had with Amasis II of Egypt and Nabonidus of Babylonia,Herodotus 1.69-70, 77. and launched his campaign against the Persian Empire in 547 BC. (The scholar Evans in 1978 examines the conflicting dates implied in Herodotus.) Croesus was intercepted near the Halys River in central Anatolia and an inconclusive battle was fought at Pteria. It was the usual practice in those days for the armies to disband for winter and Croesus did so accordingly. Cyrus did not, however, and he attacked and defeated Croesus in Thymbria and later in Sardis, eventually capturing him. It became clear that the powerful empire destroyed by the war was Croesus's own. = Rescue from death and advisor to Cyrus = Croesus vanquished, standing in front of Cyrus. By 546 BC, Croesus was defeated at the Battle of Thymbra under the wall of his capital city of Sardis. After the Siege of Sardis, he was then captured by the Persians. According to various accounts of Croesus's life, Cyrus ordered him to be burned to death on a pyre, but Croesus escaped death. Accounts of his escape vary considerably: In Bacchylides' ode,Bacchylides Ode 3.23‚Äì62. Croesus with his wife and family mounted the funeral pyre, but before the flames could envelop the king, he was snatched up by Apollo and spirited away to the Hyperboreans. Attic red-figure amphora, Louvre (G 197) Herodotus tells us that in the Lydian account, Croesus was placed upon a great pyre by Cyrus' orders, for Cyrus wanted to see if any of the heavenly powers would appear to save him from being burned alive. The pile was set ablaze, and as Cyrus the Great watched he saw Croesus call out \\"Solon\\" three times. He asked the interpreters to find out why he said this word with such resignation and agony. The interpreters returned the answer that Solon had warned Croesus of the fickleness of good fortune (see Interview with Solon above). This touched Cyrus, who realized that he and Croesus were much the same man, and he bade the servants to quench the blazing fire as quickly as they could. They tried to do this, but the flames were not to be mastered. According to the story, Croesus called out to Apollo and prayed to him. The sky had been clear and the day without a breath of wind, but soon dark clouds gathered and a storm with rain of such violence that the flames were speedily extinguished. Cyrus, thus convinced that Croesus was a good man, made him an advisor who served Cyrus \\"well\\" and later Cyrus's son by Cassandane, Cambyses.Just such an intervention in extinguishing a funeral pyre was adapted by Christian hagiographers as a conventional literary topos in the martyrdom of saints. The Cambridge History of Iran argues that there is no evidence that Cyrus the Great killed Croesus, and in particular rejects the account of burning on a pyre. It interprets Bacchylides' narration as Croesus attempting suicide and then being saved by Cyrus. Recently, Stephanie West has argued that the historical Croesus did in fact die on the pyre, and that the stories of him as a wise advisor to the courts of Cyrus and Cambyses are purely legendary, showing similarities to the sayings of Ahiqar.Stephanie West, \\"Croesus' Second Reprieve and Other Tales of the Persian Court\\", Classical Quarterly (n.s.) 53(2003): 416‚Äì437, esp. pp. 419‚Äì424. After defeating Croesus, the Persians adopted gold as the main metal for their coins. = Death = Lydian soldier in the Achaemenid army, following the Lydian defeat against the Achaemenid Empire. Xerxes I tomb, c. 480 BC. It is not known when exactly Croesus died, although it could be aligned with the traditional date for Cyrus' conquest of Lydia in 546 BC. In the Nabonidus Chronicle it is said that Cyrus \\"marched against the country ‚Äì, killed its king,The verb is \\"annihilate\\"; F. Cornelius, \\"Kroisos\\", Gymnasium 54 (1967:346‚Äì47) notes that the verb can also mean \\"destroy [as a military power]\\" as well as \\"kill\\". took his possessions, put there a garrison of his own\\". Unfortunately, all that remains of the name of the country are traces of the first cuneiform sign. It has long been assumed that this sign should be LU, so that the country referred to would be Lydia, with Croesus as the king that was killed. However, J. Cargill has shown that this restoration was based upon wishful thinking rather than actual traces of the sign LU.J. Cargill, \\"The Nabonidus chronicle and the fall of Lydia: Consensus with feet of clay\\", American Journal of Ancient History 2 (1977:97‚Äì116). Instead, J. Oelsner and R. Rollinger have both read the sign as √ö, which might imply a reference to Urartu.J. Oelsner, \\"Review of R. Rollinger, Herodots babylonischer logos: Eine kritische Untersuchung der Glaubw√ºrdigkeitsdiskussion (Innsbruck: Institut f√ºr Sprachwissenschaft 1993)\\", Archiv f√ºr Orientforschung 46/47 (1999/2000:378‚Äì80); R. Rollinger, \\"The Median \\"empire\\", the end of Urartu and Cyrus' the Great campaign in 547 BC (Nabonidus Chronicle II 16)\\", Ancient West & East 7 (2008:forthcoming). With Herodotus' account also being unreliable chronologically in this case, as J. A. S. Evans has demonstrated,Evans 1978:35‚Äì38. this means that we currently have no way of dating the fall of Sardis; theoretically, it may even have taken place after the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. Evans also asks what happened after the episode at the pyre and suggests that \\"neither the Greeks nor the Babylonians knew what really happened to Croesus\\".Evans 1978:39. = In popular culture = References to Croesus' legendary power and wealth, often as a symbol of human vanity, are numerous in literature. The following, by Isaac Watts, is from the poem titled \\"False Greatness\\": Other literary examples are \\"Croesus and Fate\\", a short story by Leo Tolstoy that is a retelling of the account of Croesus as told by Herodotus and Plutarch; and \\"Cr≈ìsus, King of Lydia\\", a tragedy in five parts by Alfred Bate Richards, first published in 1845. The Last King of Lydia, and The King and The Slave, both by Tim Leach, are historical novels centered around Croesus and based primarily on Herodotus' depiction of his life, before and after the fall of Lydia. In The Simpsons season 3 episode 19 the street signs show Mr. Burns' estate on the corner of Croesus and Mammon.

He was then appointed as the Archbishop of Gniezno and Warsaw in 1946. He was the only member of the College of Cardinals to be arrested and taken into custody by the Gestapo during World War II, and for the final years of his life was a critic of the Soviet-backed Communist regime in Poland. His cause of canonization commenced in 1992 and he was granted the title of Servant of God; on 19 May 2018 he was named Venerable after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue.  Early life and ordination Second son of a railway worker, he was born in the Upper Silesian village Brzƒôczkowice (), then ruled by Germany, now part of Mys≈Çowice (), on 5 July 1881. At twelve-years-of-age, Hlond went to Turin, Italy to study for the priesthood in the Salesian Congregation. He later studied a doctorate of philosophy in Rome, returned to Poland to complete Theology, and was ordained in Cracow in 1905.August, Cardinal Hlond; The Tablet; Page 4, 30th October 1948 In 1909 Hlond was sent to Vienna to be headmaster at a boy's secondary school. He remained in the city for 13 years, and working with spiritual and charitable organisations for Poles, and becoming Provincial of the Salesians for Austria, Hungary and Germany in 1919. Following the break up of Austria-Hungary after World War I, Pope Pius XI appointed Hlond as Apostolic Administrator for Polish Upper Silesia in 1922, and Hlond became the first Bishop of the Diocese of Katowice in 1925.  Bishop and cardinal Hlond was consecrated as Bishop of Katowice on January 3, 1926. He succeeded Cardinal Edmund Dalbor, as Primate of Poland soon after and in 1927, was appointed as Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria della Pace by Pope Pius XI. Through the tumultuous 1930s, Hlond condemned \\"escapism\\" and called on the Church should challenge the evil realities of the times, and, speaking 12 languages, became an influential member of the College of Cardinals on the international stage. In 1932, together with Ignacy Posadzy founded Society of Christ Fathers. =World War II= The invasion of predominantly Catholic Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939 ignited the Second World War. The Nazi plan for Poland entailed the destruction of the Polish nation, which necessarily required attacking the Polish Church, particularly in those areas annexed to Germany.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; p 60 In the territories annexed to Greater Germany, the Nazis set about systematically dismantling the Catholic Church - arresting its leaders, exiling its clergymen, closing its churches, monasteries and convents. Many clergymen were murdered. Elsewhere in occupied Poland, the suppression was less severe, though still harsh.http://www.yadvashem.org/download/about_holocaust/christian_world/libionka.pdf The Papal Nuncio to Poland, Fillipo Cortesi had abandoned Warsaw along with the diplomatic corps, after the invasion. Other channels existed for communications, including Cardinal Hlond.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; pp. 71-72 On 18 September 1939, at the request of the Polish Government, Hlond left Poland, with part of the Army, in order to reach Rome and report on the actions of the Nazis in Poland, and inform the world via Vatican radio and press. Hlond submitted an official account of the persecutions of the Polish Church to the Vatican, reporting seizures of church property and abuse of clergy and nuns in the annexed regions:The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 34-51 In his final observations for Pope Pius XII, Hlond wrote: Coat of Arms of August Hlond as Archbishop of Gniezno and Pozna≈Ñ (1926-1946) Coat of Arms of August Hlond as Bishop of Katowice (1925-1926) In 1939 Hlond spent several months in Rome for the conclave of 1939. In January 1940, Vatican Radio broadcast Hlond's reports of German persecution of Jews and the Catholic clergy in Poland. These reports were included in the report of the Polish government to the Nuremberg Trials after the war. In March 1940, Hlond went on a pilgrimage to Lourdes, in France. Following the Fall of France, he remained in the country, staying at the Benedictine Abbey at Hautecombe, in Savoy, where remained, unable to leave, until Himmler ordered the Gestapo to arrest him in February 1944 (the only member of the Sacred College of Cardinals to be arrested by the Nazis). The Gestapo held him at their headquarters in Paris for two months, and, with the Soviet armies now driving the Nazis back from Russia, attempted to have him declare public support for the German war against the Soviet Union, in order to secure his release. The Gestapo offered to make Hlond Regent of Poland, but, according to The Tablet, \\"The withdrawal of all German troops from Poland was necessary, the Cardinal implacably insisted, before he could even discuss any matter whatsoever with a German officer.\\" Hlond remained in the custody of the Gestapo, first at a convent at Bar-le-Duc, until the Allied advance forced the Germans to shift him to Wiedenbrtick, in Westphalia, where he remained for seven months, until released by American troops in 1945. The Americans flew Hlond to Paris, and then to Rome on April 25, finally returning to war ravaged Poland on 20 July 1945. Hlond reported in August 1941 to the Cardinal Secretary of State, Luigi Maglione, that the Polish people believed Pope Pius XII had abandoned them. This was said in light of the Nazi persecution of the Polish church and clergy. =After the war= St. John's cathedral in Warsaw Pope Pius XII appointed Hlond as Archbishop of Warsaw, on 4 March 1946 and he was installed on May 30th, amid immense crowds of supporters. The Polish Church faced great challenges: thousands of Polish clergy had been killed by the Nazis, and the Church and the Soviet-sponsored new regime in Poland were soon to clash. Hlond set about placing bishops on the empty Sees and reconnecting the Church with Rome. He spoke out against the Communist persecution of the Church. He issued a series of Pastoral Letters on behalf of the Polish Church regarding the new Poland, but these faced censorship at the hands of the new regime, and the government launched a nationalisation of church schools. In a May 1947 Pastoral Letter, Hlond wrote that \\"\\"Since the days of St. Peter, the Church has not been subjected to a persecution such as that to which she is subjected today\\". Following Hlond's death in 1948, The Tablet wrote that \\"the nations of Eastern Europe which lie today beneath the police-regimes imposed from Moscow lost their most powerful spokesman\\". =Death and burial= He was buried in the crypt of St. John's cathedral in Warsaw. In March 2006 his body was transferred to the Chapel of St. John the Baptist. Relations with ethnic Germans Hlond has been accused of overstepping his authority by forcing German Nazi supporters to resign their church posts in 1945 in favor of Poles, thereby supporting the Polish integration of formerly eastern German territories that had been given to Poland by the Allies as compensation for territory taken by the Soviet Union. Maximilian Kaller was one of the bishops who was removed from his diocese and deported to West Germany. Kaller is now in process of beatification. Another bishop forced out was Carl Maria Splett, Bishop of Danzig. Relations with Jews Monument in Pozna≈Ñ. In 1936, Cardinal Hlond, as Primate of Poland issued a pastoral letter on Catholic moral principles.Hlond, August (1936) List pasterski: O Katolickie zasady moralne. 29 February 1936. The long (5,600-word) letter covered Catholic ethics policy, ethics principles and a section on \\"sins\\" (Z Naszych Grzech√≥w) that addressed Christian shortcomings to love one's neighbours in accordance with God's law. The latter section included a brief discussion of the \\"Jewish problem\\" (Problem ≈ºydowski): > So long as Jews remain Jews, a Jewish problem exists and will continue to > exist (...) It is a fact that Jews are waging war against the Catholic > church, that they are steeped in free-thinking, and constitute the vanguard > of atheism, the Bolshevik movement, and revolutionary activity. It is a fact > that Jews have a corruptive influence on morals and that their publishing > houses are spreading pornography. It is true that Jews are perpetrating > fraud, practicing usury, and dealing in prostitution. It is true that, from > a religious and ethical point of view, Jewish youth are having a negative > influence on the Catholic youth in our schools. Reprinted 2004 by Routledge. Hlond tempered these remarks with an admission that \\"not all Jews are this way\\" and forbade assaults on Jews or attacks on their property: > There are very many Jews who are believers, honest, just, kind, and > philanthropic. There is a healthy, edifying sense of family in very many > Jewish homes. We know Jews who are ethically outstanding, noble, and > upright. One may love one's own nation more, but one may not hate anyone. > Not even Jews. (...) it is forbidden to demolish a Jewish store, damage > their merchandise, break windows, or throw things at their homes (...) it is > forbidden to assault, beat up, maim, or slander Jews. One should honor and > love Jews as human beings and neighbors Yet, despite a warning to Catholics not to take an anti-Jewish moral stance, interspersed in the letter's words of friendship was an explicit condemnation of Jewish culture and also Judaism for its rejection of Jesus Christ. > It is good to prefer your own kind when shopping, to avoid Jewish stores and > Jewish stalls in the marketplace (...) One should stay away from the harmful > moral influence of Jews, keep away from their anti-Christian culture, and > especially boycott the Jewish press and demoralizing Jewish publications. > (...) We do not honor the indescribable tragedy of that nation, which was > the guardian of the idea of the Messiah and from which was born the Savior. > When divine mercy enlightens a Jew to sincerely accept his and our Messiah, > let us greet him into our Christian ranks with joy. Hlond's letter was criticized by Polish Jewish groups who saw it as offering support and a rationalization for antisemitism. What also caught the attention of historians was the remark about not hating anyone, \\"not even Jews\\", implying \\"not even enemies\\". Were Jews to be loved as neighbours or enemies? However, while Hlond promoted the expulsion of German civilians after World War II, he had always consistently condemned the Nazi persecution of the Jews. Controversy was caused by Hlond's reaction to the Kielce pogrom, that took place in Polish town of Kielce on July 4, 1946. While condemning murders, Hlond denied the racist nature of this crime. He saw the pogrom as a reaction against Jewish bureaucrats serving Communist regime. This position was echoed by Cardinal Sapieha, who was reported to have said that the Jews brought it on themselves. Beatification proposal The process of beatification commenced in 1992 and he was granted the title of Servant of God. Professor Franz Scholz, a German theologian, as well as many others have expressed their opposition to the proposed beatification of Cardinal Hlond. Scholz opposes his actions against post-war German expellees and civilians from territories ceded by Allies to the Polish Republic. Documentation (a Positio) was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (CCS) in 2008 and on 9 March 2017 a group of nine theologians approved naming Hlond \\"Venerable\\" with 8 votes in favor and 1 abstention. The members of the CCS approved the cause on 15 May 2018 and Pope Francis confirmed Hlond's heroic virtue allowing Hlond to be named as Venerable on 19 May. The American Jewish Committee questioned the pope's decision to name Hlond as Venerable in a letter sent to Cardinal Kurt Koch (the letter was also sent to the CCS and to Cardinal Pietro Parolin) in which the AJC noted that Hlond was anti-Semitic in his writings and not only failed to stop a 1946 pogrom he blamed the Jewish victims for it.https://www.ajc.org/news/ajc-questions-papal-decree-to-canonize-polish- cardinal-hlond The current postulator for this cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni.

Certified organic agriculture accounts for 70 million hectares globally, with over half of that total in Australia.Paull, John (2019) Organic Agriculture in Australia: Attaining the Global Majority (51%), Journal of Environment Protection and Sustainable Development, 5(2):70-74. Organic farming continues to be developed by various organizations today. It is defined by the use of fertilizers of organic origin such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting. Biological pest control, mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. Organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances. For instance, naturally occurring pesticides such as pyrethrin and rotenone are permitted, while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are generally prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed include, for example, copper sulfate, elemental sulfur and Ivermectin. Genetically modified organisms, nanomaterials, human sewage sludge, plant growth regulators, hormones, and antibiotic use in livestock husbandry are prohibited.Paull, John (2011) \\"Nanomaterials in food and agriculture: The big issue of small matter for organic food and farming\\", Proceedings of the Third Scientific Conference of ISOFAR (International Society of Organic Agriculture Research), 28 September ‚Äì 1 October, Namyangju, Korea., 2:96-99 Organic farming advocates claim advantages in sustainability, openness, self-sufficiency, autonomy/independence, health, food security, and food safety. Organic agricultural methods are internationally regulated and legally enforced by many nations, based in large part on the standards set by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), an international umbrella organization for organic farming organizations established in 1972.Paull, John \\"From France to the World: The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM)\\", Journal of Social Research & Policy, 2010, 1(2):93-102. Organic agriculture can be defined as \\"an integrated farming system that strives for sustainability, the enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity while, with rare exceptions, prohibiting synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, and growth hormones\\".Danielle Treadwell, Jim Riddle, Mary Barbercheck, Deborah Cavanaugh-Grant, Ed Zaborski, Cooperative Extension System, What is organic farming? H. Martin, '‚ÄôOntario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Introduction to Organic Farming, Dale Rhoads, Purdue Extension Service, What is organic farming? Since 1990, the market for organic food and other products has grown rapidly, reaching $63 billion worldwide in 2012.Helga Willer, Julia Lernoud and Robert Home The World of Organic Agriculture: Statistics & Emerging Trends 2013, Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM, 2013). This demand has driven a similar increase in organically managed farmland that grew from 2001 to 2011 at a compounding rate of 8.9% per annum.Paull, John (2011) \\"The Uptake of Organic Agriculture: A Decade of Worldwide Development\\", Journal of Social and Development Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 111-120. As of 2018, approximately worldwide were farmed organically, representing approximately 1.5 percent of total world farmland.  History  Agriculture was practiced for thousands of years without the use of artificial chemicals. Artificial fertilizers were first created during the mid-19th century. These early fertilizers were cheap, powerful, and easy to transport in bulk. Similar advances occurred in chemical pesticides in the 1940s, leading to the decade being referred to as the 'pesticide era'. These new agricultural techniques, while beneficial in the short term, had serious longer term side effects such as soil compaction, erosion, and declines in overall soil fertility, along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, soil biology scientists began to seek ways to remedy these side effects while still maintaining higher production. In 1921 the founder and pioneer of the organic movement Albert Howard and his wife Gabrielle Howard,Joseph Heckman, A History of Organic Farming: Transitions from Sir Albert Howard‚Äôs War in the Soil to the USDA National Organic Program accomplished botanists, founded an Institute of Plant Industry to improve traditional farming methods in India. Among other things, they brought improved implements and improved animal husbandry methods from their scientific training; then by incorporating aspects of Indian traditional methods, developed protocols for the rotation of crops, erosion prevention techniques, and the systematic use of composts and manures.Yeshwant D. Wad, The Work At Indore Stimulated by these experiences of traditional farming, when Albert Howard returned to Britain in the early 1930sGabrielle Howard had died while the Howards were still in India. he began to promulgate a system of organic agriculture. In 1924 Rudolf Steiner gave a series of eight lectures on agriculture with a focus on influences of the moon, planets, non-physical beings and elemental forces.Paull, John (2013) \\"Koberwitz (Kobierzyce); In the footseps of Rudolf Steiner'\\", Journal of Bio- Dynamics Tasmania, 109 (Autumn), pp. 7-11.Paull, John (2013) \\"Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw): In the footsteps of Rudolf Steiner\\", Journal of Bio- Dynamics Tasmania, 110:10-15. They were held in response to a request by adherent farmers who noticed degraded soil conditions and a deterioration in the health and quality of crops and livestock resulting from the use of chemical fertilizers.Diver (1999), \\"Introduction\\" . The lectures were published in November 1924; the first English translation appeared in 1928 as The Agriculture Course. In July 1939, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, the author of the standard work on biodynamic agriculture (Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening), came to the UK at the invitation of Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne as a presenter at the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne's farm in Kent.Paull, John (2011) \\"The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming\\", Journal of Organic Systems, 6(2):13-26. One of the chief purposes of the conference was to bring together the proponents of various approaches to organic agriculture in order that they might cooperate within a larger movement. Howard attended the conference, where he met Pfeiffer.Ehrenfried E. Pfeiffer, Sir Albert Howard's Deed for Science In the following year, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, Look to the Land, in which he coined the term \\"organic farming.\\" The Betteshanger conference has been described as the 'missing link' between biodynamic agriculture and other forms of organic farming. In 1940 Howard published his An Agricultural Testament. In this book he adopted Northbourne's terminology of \\"organic farming.\\"Paull, John (2006) The Farm as Organism: The Foundational Idea of Organic Agriculture Elementals ~ Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania 83:14‚Äì18 Howard's work spread widely, and he became known as the \\"father of organic farming\\" for his work in applying scientific knowledge and principles to various traditional and natural methods. In the United States J.I. Rodale, who was keenly interested both in Howard's ideas and in biodynamics, founded in the 1940s both a working organic farm for trials and experimentation, The Rodale Institute, and the Rodale Press to teach and advocate organic methods to the wider public. These became important influences on the spread of organic agriculture. Further work was done by Lady Eve Balfour (the Haughley Experiment) in the United Kingdom, and many others across the world. The term \\"eco-agriculture\\" was coined in 1970 by Charles Walters, founder of Acres Magazine, to describe agriculture which does not use \\"man-made molecules of toxic rescue chemistry\\", effectively another name for organic agriculture. Increasing environmental awareness in the general population in modern times has transformed the originally supply-driven organic movement to a demand- driven one. Premium prices and some government subsidies attracted farmers. In the developing world, many producers farm according to traditional methods that are comparable to organic farming, but not certified, and that may not include the latest scientific advancements in organic agriculture. In other cases, farmers in the developing world have converted to modern organic methods for economic reasons.Paull, John \\"China's Organic Revolution\\", Journal of Organic Systems (2007) 2 (1): 1-11. =Terminology= The use of \\"organic\\" popularized by Howard and Rodale refers more narrowly to the use of organic matter derived from plant compost and animal manures to improve the humus content of soils, grounded in the work of early soil scientists who developed what was then called \\"humus farming.\\" Since the early 1940s the two camps have tended to merge. Biodynamic agriculturists, on the other hand, used the term \\"organic\\" to indicate that a farm should be viewed as a living organism, in the sense of the following quotation: They based their work on Steiner's spiritually-oriented alternative agriculture which includes various esoteric concepts.  Methods  Organic cultivation of mixed vegetables in Capay, California Organic farming methods combine scientific knowledge of ecology and some modern technology with traditional farming practices based on naturally occurring biological processes. Organic farming methods are studied in the field of agroecology. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is pyrethrin, which is found naturally in the Chrysanthemum flower. The principal methods of organic farming include crop rotation, green manures and compost, biological pest control, and mechanical cultivation. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: legumes are planted to fix nitrogen into the soil, natural insect predators are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as potassium bicarbonateFiBL (2006) Use of potassium bicarbonate as a fungicide in organic farming and mulches are used to control disease and weeds. Genetically modified seeds and animals are excluded. While organic is fundamentally different from conventional because of the use of carbon based fertilizers compared with highly soluble synthetic based fertilizers and biological pest control instead of synthetic pesticides, organic farming and large-scale conventional farming are not entirely mutually exclusive. Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example, Integrated Pest Management is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include synthetic pesticides only as a last resort. = Crop diversity = Organic farming encourages Crop diversity. The science of agroecology has revealed the benefits of polyculture (multiple crops in the same space), which is often employed in organic farming.Fargione J, and D Tilman. 2002. \\"Competition and coexistence in terrestrial plants\\". Pages 156-206 In U. Sommer and B Worm editors, Competition and Coexistence. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany. Planting a variety of vegetable crops supports a wider range of beneficial insects, soil microorganisms, and other factors that add up to overall farm health. Crop diversity helps environments thrive and protects species from going extinct.Crop diversity: A Distinctive Characteristic of an Organic Farming Method - Organic Farming; 15 April 2013 = Soil management = Placard advocating organic food rather than global warming. Organic farming relies heavily on the natural breakdown of organic matter, using techniques like green manure and composting, to replace nutrients taken from the soil by previous crops. This biological process, driven by microorganisms such as mycorrhiza and earthworms allows the natural production of nutrients in the soil throughout the growing season, and has been referred to as feeding the soil to feed the plant. Organic farming uses a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing tillage, soil is not inverted and exposed to air; less carbon is lost to the atmosphere resulting in more soil organic carbon. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which can reduce green house gases and help reverse climate change . Plants need a large number of nutrients in various quantities to flourish. Supplying enough nitrogen and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the when plants need it most, is a challenge for organic farmers. Preprint with free full-text. Crop rotation and green manure (\\"cover crops\\") help to provide nitrogen through legumes (more precisely, the family Fabaceae), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with rhizobial bacteria. Intercropping, which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. Crop residues can be ploughed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization. Organic farmers also use animal manure, certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various mineral powders such as rock phosphate and green sand, a naturally occurring form of potash that provides potassium. Together these methods help to control erosion. In some cases pH may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include lime and sulfur, but in the U.S. some compounds such as iron sulfate, aluminum sulfate, magnesium sulfate, and soluble boron products are allowed in organic farming. Mixed farms with both livestock and crops can operate as ley farms, whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing forage grasses such as white clover or alfalfa and grows cash crops or cereals when fertility is established. Farms without livestock (\\"stockless\\") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported manure as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested. Horticultural farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs. Biological research into soil and soil organisms has proven beneficial to organic farming. Varieties of bacteria and fungi break down chemicals, plant matter and animal waste into productive soil nutrients. In turn, they produce benefits of healthier yields and more productive soil for future crops. Fields with less or no manure display significantly lower yields, due to decreased soil microbe community. Increased manure improves biological activity, providing a healthier, more arable soil system and higher yields. = Weed management = Organic weed management promotes weed suppression, rather than weed elimination, by enhancing crop competition and phytotoxic effects on weeds.Kathleen Delate and Robert Hartzler. 2003. Weed Management for Organic Farmers. Iowa State University Extension Bulletin 1883. Organic farmers integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical tactics to manage weeds without synthetic herbicides. Organic standards require rotation of annual crops,Staff, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Organic Standards meaning that a single crop cannot be grown in the same location without a different, intervening crop. Organic crop rotations frequently include weed-suppressive cover crops and crops with dissimilar life cycles to discourage weeds associated with a particular crop. Research is ongoing to develop organic methods to promote the growth of natural microorganisms that suppress the growth or germination of common weeds. Other cultural practices used to enhance crop competitiveness and reduce weed pressure include selection of competitive crop varieties, high-density planting, tight row spacing, and late planting into warm soil to encourage rapid crop germination. Mechanical and physical weed control practices used on organic farms can be broadly grouped as:Mark Schonbeck, Virginia Association for Biological Farming. Last Updated: 23 March 2010. An Organic Weed Control Toolbox . * Tillage - Turning the soil between crops to incorporate crop residues and soil amendments; remove existing weed growth and prepare a seedbed for planting; turning soil after seeding to kill weeds, including cultivation of row crops; * Mowing and cutting - Removing top growth of weeds; * Flame weeding and thermal weeding - Using heat to kill weeds; and * Mulching - Blocking weed emergence with organic materials, plastic films, or landscape fabric. Some critics, citing work published in 1997 by David Pimentel of Cornell University,Pimentel D et al. (1997) Environmental and Economic Costs of Soil Erosion and Economic Benefits of Conservation Science 267(52010):1117-1123 which described an epidemic of soil erosion worldwide, have raised concerned that tillage contribute to the erosion epidemic. The FAO and other organizations have advocated a 'no-till' approach to both conventional and organic farming, and point out in particular that crop rotation techniques used in organic farming are excellent no-till approaches.David R. Huggins and John P. Reganold. (2008) No-till: The Quiet Revolution Scientific American July 2008 Issue:70-77 A study published in 2005 by Pimentel and colleagues confirmed that 'Crop rotations and cover cropping (green manure) typical of organic agriculture reduce soil erosion, pest problems, and pesticide use.' Some naturally sourced chemicals are allowed for herbicidal use. These include certain formulations of acetic acid (concentrated vinegar), corn gluten meal, and essential oils. A few selective bioherbicides based on fungal pathogens have also been developed. At this time, however, organic herbicides and bioherbicides play a minor role in the organic weed control toolbox. Weeds can be controlled by grazing. For example, geese have been used successfully to weed a range of organic crops including cotton, strawberries, tobacco, and corn,Glenn Geiger and Harold Biellier. 1993. Weeding With Geese. University of Missouri Extension Bulletin G8922. reviving the practice of keeping cotton patch geese, common in the southern U.S. before the 1950s. Similarly, some rice farmers introduce ducks and fish to wet paddy fields to eat both weeds and insects.How to feed the world By Laurent Belsie (edition of 20 February 2003) The Christian Science Monitor = Controlling other organisms = Chloroxylon is used for Pest Management in Organic Rice Cultivation in Chhattisgarh, India Organisms aside from weeds that cause problems on organic farms include arthropods (e.g., insects, mites), nematodes, fungi and bacteria. Organic practices include, but are not limited to: * encouraging predatory beneficial insects to control pests by serving them nursery plants and/or an alternative habitat, usually in a form of a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank; * encouraging beneficial microorganisms; * rotating crops to different locations from year to year to interrupt pest reproduction cycles; * planting companion crops and pest- repelling plants that discourage or divert pests; * using row covers to protect crops during pest migration periods; * using biologic pesticides and herbicides; * using stale seed beds to germinate and destroy weeds before planting;Presentation by Ilse A. Rasmussen, Dept. of Crop Protection, Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences. Sowing time, false seedbed, row distance and mechanical weed control in organic winter wheat * using sanitation to remove pest habitat; * using insect traps to monitor and control insect populations; and * using physical barriers, such as row covers. Examples of predatory beneficial insects include minute pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, and to a lesser extent ladybugs (which tend to fly away), all of which eat a wide range of pests. Lacewings are also effective, but tend to fly away. Praying mantis tend to move more slowly and eat less heavily. Parasitoid wasps tend to be effective for their selected prey, but like all small insects can be less effective outdoors because the wind controls their movement. Predatory mites are effective for controlling other mites. Naturally derived insecticides allowed for use on organic farms use include Bacillus thuringiensis (a bacterial toxin), pyrethrum (a chrysanthemum extract), spinosad (a bacterial metabolite), neem (a tree extract) and rotenone (a legume root extract). Fewer than 10% of organic farmers use these pesticides regularly; one survey found that only 5.3% of vegetable growers in California use rotenone while 1.7% use pyrethrum. These pesticides are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm.Gillman J. (2008). The Truth About Organic Farming. The main criterion for organic pesticides is that they are naturally derived, and some naturally derived substances have been controversial. Controversial natural pesticides include rotenone, copper, nicotine sulfate, and pyrethrumsIFOAM. Criticisms and Frequent Misconceptions about Organic Agriculture: The Counter-Arguments Pottorff LP. Some Pesticides Permitted in Organic Gardening. Colorado State University Cooperative Extension. Rotenone and pyrethrum are particularly controversial because they work by attacking the nervous system, like most conventional insecticides. Rotenone is extremely toxic to fishMarking, L. L. and T. D. Bills. 1976. Toxicity of rotenone to fish in standardized laboratory tests. U. S. Dept. Interior, No. 72. 11 pp. and can induce symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease in mammals. Although pyrethrum (natural pyrethrins) is more effective against insects when used with piperonyl butoxide (which retards degradation of the pyrethrins),Jones, D. 1998. Piperonyl butoxide: the insecticide synergist. Academic Press, London. 323 pp. organic standards generally do not permit use of the latter substance.Canadian General Standards Board. CAN/CGSB-32.311-2006.OGA. 2004. OGA standard. Organic Growers of Australia. Inc. 32 pp.7 CFR, part 205. U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Naturally derived fungicides allowed for use on organic farms include the bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus pumilus; and the fungus Trichoderma harzianum. These are mainly effective for diseases affecting roots. Compost tea contains a mix of beneficial microbes, which may attack or out-compete certain plant pathogens, but variability among formulations and preparation methods may contribute to inconsistent results or even dangerous growth of toxic microbes in compost teas. Some naturally derived pesticides are not allowed for use on organic farms. These include nicotine sulfate, arsenic, and strychnine. Synthetic pesticides allowed for use on organic farms include insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils for insect management; and Bordeaux mixture, copper hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate for managing fungi. Copper sulfate and Bordeaux mixture (copper sulfate plus lime), approved for organic use in various jurisdictions, can be more environmentally problematic than some synthetic fungicides dissallowed in organic farmingLeake, A. R. 1999. House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. Session 1998-99, 16th Report. Organic Farming and the European Union. p. 81. Cited by Similar concerns apply to copper hydroxide. Repeated application of copper sulfate or copper hydroxide as a fungicide may eventually result in copper accumulation to toxic levels in soil,Caldwell, B., E. B. Rosen, E. Sideman, A. M. Shelton and C. D. Smart. 2005. Resource guide for organic insect and disease management. Cornell Univ. and admonitions to avoid excessive accumulations of copper in soil appear in various organic standards and elsewhere. Environmental concerns for several kinds of biota arise at average rates of use of such substances for some crops.Health Canada. 2009. Consultation document on copper pesticides - proposed re-evaluation decision - PRVD2009-04. In the European Union, where replacement of copper-based fungicides in organic agriculture is a policy priority,Cooper, J., U. Niggli and C. Leifert (eds.). 2007. Handbook of organic food safety and quality. CRC Press, Boca Raton. 544 pp. research is seeking alternatives for organic production. = Livestock = For livestock, like these healthy cows, vaccines play an important part in animal health since antibiotic therapy is prohibited in organic farming Raising livestock and poultry, for meat, dairy and eggs, is another traditional farming activity that complements growing. Organic farms attempt to provide animals with natural living conditions and feed. Organic certification verifies that livestock are raised according to the USDA organic regulations throughout their lives. These regulations include the requirement that all animal feed must be certified organic. Organic livestock may be, and must be, treated with medicine when they are sick, but drugs cannot be used to promote growth, their feed must be organic, and they must be pastured.FAO Guidelines for the Production, Processing, Labelling and Marketing of Organically Produced Foods (Gl 32 ‚Äì 1999, Rev. 1 ‚Äì 2001) Also, horses and cattle were once a basic farm feature that provided labour, for hauling and plowing, fertility, through recycling of manure, and fuel, in the form of food for farmers and other animals. While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit. = Genetic modification = A key characteristic of organic farming is the rejection of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM's 12th Scientific Conference issued the Mar del Plata Declaration, where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in food production and agriculture. Although opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez- Morales continue to advocate integration of transgenic technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world. Organic farmer Raoul Adamchak and geneticist Pamela Ronald write that many agricultural applications of biotechnology are consistent with organic principles and have significantly advanced sustainable agriculture. Although GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and heirloom seed stocks, making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article on regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms. = Tools = Organic farmers use a number of traditional farm tools to do farming. Due to the goals of sustainability in organic farming, organic farmers try to minimize their reliance on fossil fuels. In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and diesel powered water pumps.  Standards  Standards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 EU-Eco-regulation developed for European Union, which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the National Organic Program (NOP).USDA NOP Program Standards. Retrieved 2 April 2008. As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming (IFOAM 2007:11). In 2005 IFOAM created the Principles of Organic Agriculture, an international guideline for certification criteria.IFOAM. (2005). The IFOAM Norms Typically the agencies accredit certification groups rather than individual farms. Production materials used for the creation of USDA Organic certified foods require the approval of a NOP accredited certifier. = Composting = Using manure as a fertilizer risks contaminating food with animal gut bacteria, including pathogenic strains of E. coli that have caused fatal poisoning from eating organic food. To combat this risk, USDA organic standards require that manure must be sterilized through high temperature thermophilic composting. If raw animal manure is used, 120 days must pass before the crop is harvested if the final product comes into direct contact with the soil. For products that don't directly contact soil, 90 days must pass prior to harvest. In the US, the Organic Food Production Act of 1990 (OFPA,) as amended, specifies that a farm can not be certified as organic if the compost being used contains any synthetic ingredients. The OFPA singles out commercially blended fertilizers [composts] disallowing the use of any fertilizer [compost] that contains prohibited materials.  Economics  The economics of organic farming, a subfield of agricultural economics, encompasses the entire process and effects of organic farming in terms of human society, including social costs, opportunity costs, unintended consequences, information asymmetries, and economies of scale. Although the scope of economics is broad, agricultural economics tends to focus on maximizing yields and efficiency at the farm level. Economics takes an anthropocentric approach to the value of the natural world: biodiversity, for example, is considered beneficial only to the extent that it is valued by people and increases profits. Some entities such as the European Union subsidize organic farming, in large part because these countries want to account for the externalities of reduced water use, reduced water contamination, reduced soil erosion, reduced carbon emissions, increased biodiversity, and assorted other benefits that result from organic farming. Traditional organic farming is labour and knowledge-intensive whereas conventional farming is capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs. Organic farmers in California have cited marketing as their greatest obstacle.Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L. (2007). Conventional, Mixed, and \\"Deregistered\\" Organic Farmers: Entry Barriers and Reasons for Exiting Organic Production in California. California Institute for Rural Studies. = Geographic producer distribution = A density-equalising map of organic agriculture in Australia based on certified organic hectares. Australia accounts for more than half of the world's certified organic hectares. The markets for organic products are strongest in North America and Europe, which as of 2001 are estimated to have $6 and $8 billion respectively of the $20 billion global market. As of 2007 Australasia has 39% of the total organic farmland, including Australia's but 97 percent of this land is sprawling rangeland (2007:35). US sales are 20x as much. Europe farms 23 percent of global organic farmland (), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean with 20 percent (). Asia has 9.5 percent while North America has 7.2 percent. Africa has 3 percent.Organic farming by country Besides Australia, the countries with the most organic farmland are Argentina (3.1 million hectares - 7.7 million acres), China (2.3 million hectares - 5.7 million acres), and the United States (1.6 million hectares - 4 million acres). Much of Argentina's organic farmland is pasture, like that of Australia (2007:42). Spain, Germany, Brazil (the world's largest agricultural exporter), Uruguay, and the England follow the United States in the amount of organic land (2007:26). In the European Union (EU25) 3.9% of the total utilized agricultural area was used for organic production in 2005. The countries with the highest proportion of organic land were Austria (11%) and Italy (8.4%), followed by the Czech Republic and Greece (both 7.2%). The lowest figures were shown for Malta (0.2%), Poland (0.6%) and Ireland (0.8%). In 2009, the proportion of organic land in the EU grew to 4.7%. The countries with highest share of agricultural land were Liechtenstein (26.9%), Austria (18.5%) and Sweden (12.6%).Helga Willer, Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBL, Switzerland. Organic Agriculture in Europe 2009: Production and Market BioFach Congress, N√ºrnberg, 18 February 2011 16% of all farmers in Austria produced organically in 2010. By the same year the proportion of organic land increased to 20%.: In 2005 168,000 ha (415,000 ac) of land in Poland was under organic management. In 2012, 288,261 hectares (712,308 acres) were under organic production, and there were about 15,500 organic farmers; retail sales of organic products were EUR 80 million in 2011. As of 2012 organic exports were part of the government's economic development strategy.IFOAM. IFOAM EU: Romania profile Page accessed 4 March 2015 After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, agricultural inputs that had previously been purchased from Eastern bloc countries were no longer available in Cuba, and many Cuban farms converted to organic methods out of necessity. Consequently, organic agriculture is a mainstream practice in Cuba, while it remains an alternative practice in most other countries.Anna Glayzer for The Food Commission. 19 July 2010 Cuba's food production revolutionAndrea Swenson for Modern Farmer. 17 November 2014 Photo Essay: Cuban Farmers Return to the Old Ways Cuba's organic strategy includes development of genetically modified crops; specifically corn that is resistant to the palomilla moth. = Growth = Organic farmland by world region (2000-2008) In 2001, the global market value of certified organic products was estimated at US$20 billion. By 2002, this was US$23 billion and by 2015 more than US$43 billion. By 2014, retail sales of organic products reached US$80 billion worldwide. North America and Europe accounted for more than 90% of all organic product sales. In 2018 Australia accounted for 54% of the world's certified organic land with the country recording more than 35,000,000 verified organic hectares.Paull, John & Hennig, Benjamin (2018) Maps of Organic Agriculture in Australia, Journal of Organics. 5 (1): 29‚Äì39. Organic agricultural land increased almost fourfold in 15 years, from 11 million hectares in 1999 to 43.7 million hectares in 2014. Between 2013 and 2014, organic agricultural land grew by 500,000 hectares worldwide, increasing in every region except Latin America. During this time period, Europe's organic farmland increased 260,000 hectares to 11.6 million total (+2.3%), Asia's increased 159,000 hectares to 3.6 million total (+4.7%), Africa's increased 54,000 hectares to 1.3 million total (+4.5%), and North America's increased 35,000 hectares to 3.1 million total (+1.1%). As of 2014, the country with the most organic land was Australia (17.2 million hectares), followed by Argentina (3.1 million hectares), and the United States (2.2 million hectares). Australia's organic land area has increased at a rate of 16.5% per annum for the past eighteen years. In 2013, the number of organic producers grew by almost 270,000, or more than 13%. By 2014, there were a reported 2.3 million organic producers in the world. Most of the total global increase took place in the Philippines, Peru, China, and Thailand. Overall, the majority of all organic producers are in India (650,000 in 2013), Uganda (190,552 in 2014), Mexico (169,703 in 2013) and the Philippines (165,974 in 2014). = Productivity = Studies comparing yields have had mixed results. These differences among findings can often be attributed to variations between study designs including differences in the crops studied and the methodology by which results were gathered. A 2012 meta-analysis found that productivity is typically lower for organic farming than conventional farming, but that the size of the difference depends on context and in some cases may be very small. While organic yields can be lower than conventional yields, another meta- analysis published in Sustainable Agriculture Research in 2015, concluded that certain organic on-farm practices could help narrow this gap. Timely weed management and the application of manure in conjunction with legume forages/cover crops were shown to have positive results in increasing organic corn and soybean productivity. Another meta-analysis published in the journal Agricultural Systems in 2011 analysed 362 datasets and found that organic yields were on average 80% of conventional yields. The author's found that there are relative differences in this yield gap based on crop type with crops like soybeans and rice scoring higher than the 80% average and crops like wheat and potato scoring lower. Across global regions, Asia and Central Europe were found to have relatively higher yields and Northern Europe relatively lower than the average. A 2007 study compiling research from 293 different comparisons into a single study to assess the overall efficiency of the two agricultural systems has concluded that \\"organic methods could produce enough food on a global per capita basis to sustain the current human population, and potentially an even larger population, without increasing the agricultural land base.\\" The researchers also found that while in developed countries, organic systems on average produce 92% of the yield produced by conventional agriculture, organic systems produce 80% more than conventional farms in developing countries, because the materials needed for organic farming are more accessible than synthetic farming materials to farmers in some poor countries. This study's methodology and results were contested by D.J. Connor of The University of Melbourne, in a short communication published in Field Crops Research. Connor writes that errors in Badgley et al. result in \\"major overestimation of the productivity of OA\\". Long term studies A study published in 2005 compared conventional cropping, organic animal-based cropping, and organic legume-based cropping on a test farm at the Rodale Institute over 22 years.Pimentel DP et al. (2005) Environmental, Energetic, and Economic Comparisons of Organic and Conventional Farming Systems Bioscience 55(7): 573-582. The study found that \\"the crop yields for corn and soybeans were similar in the organic animal, organic legume, and conventional farming systems\\". It also found that \\"significantly less fossil energy was expended to produce corn in the Rodale Institute‚Äôs organic animal and organic legume systems than in the conventional production system. There was little difference in energy input between the different treatments for producing soybeans. In the organic systems, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides were generally not used\\". As of 2013 the Rodale study was ongoing and a thirty-year anniversary report was published by Rodale in 2012. A long-term field study comparing organic/conventional agriculture carried out over 21 years in Switzerland concluded that \\"Crop yields of the organic systems averaged over 21 experimental years at 80% of the conventional ones. The fertilizer input, however, was 34 ‚Äì 51% lower, indicating an efficient production. The organic farming systems used 20 ‚Äì 56% less energy to produce a crop unit and per land area this difference was 36 ‚Äì 53%. In spite of the considerably lower pesticide input the quality of organic products was hardly discernible from conventional analytically and even came off better in food preference trials and picture creating methods\\"Fliessbach, et al. (Research Institute of Organic Agriculture), \\"D-O-K (Biodynamic-Bioorganic-Conventional): Results From 21 Year Old Field Experiment\\" . = Profitability = In the United States, organic farming has been shown to be 2.7 to 3.8 times more profitable for the farmer than conventional farming when prevailing price premiums are taken into account. Globally, organic farming is between 22 and 35 percent more profitable for farmers than conventional methods, according to a 2015 meta- analysis of studies conducted across five continents. The profitability of organic agriculture can be attributed to a number of factors. First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield. The price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits. These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices, available through the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops, but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold: farmers' markets, grocery stores, or wholesale to restaurants. For many producers, direct sales at farmers' markets are most profitable because the farmer receives the entire markup, however this is also the most time and labour- intensive approach. There have been signs of organic price premiums narrowing in recent years, which lowers the economic incentive for farmers to convert to or maintain organic production methods. Data from 22 years of experiments at the Rodale Institute found that, based on the current yields and production costs associated with organic farming in the United States, a price premium of only 10% is required to achieve parity with conventional farming. A separate study found that on a global scale, price premiums of only 5-7% percent were needed to break even with conventional methods. Without the price premium, profitability for farmers is mixed. For markets and supermarkets organic food is profitable as well, and is generally sold at significantly higher prices than non-organic food. = Energy efficiency = In the most recent assessments of the energy efficiency of organic versus conventional agriculture, results have been mixed regarding which form is more carbon efficient. Organic farm systems have more often than not been found to be more energy efficient, however, this is not always the case. More than anything, results tend to depend upon crop type and farm size. A comprehensive comparison of energy efficiency in grain production, produce yield, and animal husbandry concluded that organic farming had a higher yield per unit of energy over the vast majority of the crops and livestock systems. For example, two studies - both comparing organically- versus conventionally-farmed apples - declare contradicting results, one saying organic farming is more energy efficient, the other saying conventionally is more efficient. It has generally been found that the labour input per unit of yield was higher for organic systems compared with conventional production. = Sales and marketing = Most sales are concentrated in developed nations. In 2008, 69% of Americans claimed to occasionally buy organic products, down from 73% in 2005. One theory for this change was that consumers were substituting \\"local\\" produce for \\"organic\\" produce.CNN. Consumer surveys show slipping interest in organic productsThe Hartman Group Organic Marketplace Reports . = Distributors = The USDA requires that distributors, manufacturers, and processors of organic products be certified by an accredited state or private agency. In 2007, there were 3,225 certified organic handlers, up from 2,790 in 2004.Dimitri, Carolyn, and Lydia Oberholtzer. Marketing U.S. Organic Foods: Recent Trends From Farms to Consumers. Economic Information Bulletin No. 58. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. September 2009. http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/185272/eib58_1_.pdf Organic handlers are often small firms; 48% reported sales below $1 million annually, and 22% between $1 and $5 million per year. Smaller handlers are more likely to sell to independent natural grocery stores and natural product chains whereas large distributors more often market to natural product chains and conventional supermarkets, with a small group marketing to independent natural product stores. Some handlers work with conventional farmers to convert their land to organic with the knowledge that the farmer will have a secure sales outlet. This lowers the risk for the handler as well as the farmer. In 2004, 31% of handlers provided technical support on organic standards or production to their suppliers and 34% encouraged their suppliers to transition to organic. Smaller farms often join together in cooperatives to market their goods more effectively. 93% of organic sales are through conventional and natural food supermarkets and chains, while the remaining 7% of U.S. organic food sales occur through farmers' markets, foodservices, and other marketing channels.  Direct-to-consumer sales  In the 2012 Census, direct-to-consumer sales equalled $1.3 billion, up from $812 million in 2002, an increase of 60 percent. The number of farms that utilize direct-to-consumer sales was 144,530 in 2012 in comparison to 116,733 in 2002. Direct-to-consumer sales include farmers' markets, community supported agriculture (CSA), on-farm stores, and roadside farm stands. Some organic farms also sell products direct to retailer, direct to restaurant and direct to institution. According to the 2008 Organic Production Survey, approximately 7% of organic farm sales were direct-to-consumers, 10% went direct to retailers, and approximately 83% went into wholesale markets. In comparison, only 0.4% of the value of convention agricultural commodities were direct-to-consumers.Dimitri, Carolyn, Lydia Oberholtzer, and Michelle Wittenberger. The Role of Contracts in the Organic Supply Chain: 2004 and 2007, EIB-69, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, December 2010. http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/134484/eib69.pdf While not all products sold at farmer's markets are certified organic, this direct-to-consumer avenue has become increasingly popular in local food distribution and has grown substantially since 1994. In 2014, there were 8,284 farmer's markets in comparison to 3,706 in 2004 and 1,755 in 1994, most of which are found in populated areas such as the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast. = Labour and employment = Organic production is more labour-intensive than conventional production.Staff, FAO Organic Agriculture FAQ On the one hand, this increased labour cost is one factor that makes organic food more expensive. On the other hand, the increased need for labour may be seen as an \\"employment dividend\\" of organic farming, providing more jobs per unit area than conventional systems.Green M and Maynard R. The employment benefits of organic farming Aspects of Applied Biology 79, 2006; 51-55 The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report suggests that \\"[a]n increase in investment in green agriculture is projected to lead to growth in employment of about 60 per cent compared with current levels\\" and that \\"green agriculture investments could create 47 million additional jobs compared with BAU2 over the next 40 years.\\"Citation used: UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) also argues that \\"[b]y greening agriculture and food distribution, more calories per person per day, more jobs and business opportunities especially in rural areas, and market-access opportunities, especially for developing countries, will be available.\\" Much of the growth in women labour participation in agriculture is outside the \\"male dominated field of conventional agriculture\\". Operators in organic farming are 21% women, as opposed to 14% in farming in general. = World's food security = In 2007 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said that organic agriculture often leads to higher prices and hence a better income for farmers, so it should be promoted. However, FAO stressed that by organic farming one could not feed the current mankind, even less the bigger future population. Both data and models showed then that organic farming was far from sufficient. Therefore, chemical fertilizers were needed to avoid hunger.Organic agriculture can contribute to fighting hunger - But chemical fertilizers needed to feed the world, FAO, 10 December 2007, Rome. Other analysis by many agribusiness executives, agricultural and environmental scientists, and international agriculture experts revealed the opinion that organic farming would not only increase the world's food supply, but might be the only way to eradicate hunger. FAO stressed that fertilizers and other chemical inputs can much increase the production, particularly in Africa where fertilizers are currently used 90% less than in Asia. For example, in Malawi the yield has been boosted using seeds and fertilizers. FAO also calls for using biotechnology, as it can help smallholder farmers to improve their income and food security.Overcoming smallholder challenges with biotechnology, FAO, 29 October 2013, Rome. Also NEPAD, development organization of African governments, announced that feeding Africans and preventing malnutrition requires fertilizers and enhanced seeds.Meeting Africa's Food Challenge, The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), 9‚Äì13 June 2006, Abuja, Nigeria. According to a 2012 study in ScienceDigest, organic best management practices shows an average yield only 13% less than conventional. In the world's poorer nations where most of the world's hungry live, and where conventional agriculture's expensive inputs are not affordable by the majority of farmers, adopting organic management actually increases yields 93% on average, and could be an important part of increased food security. = Capacity building in developing countries = Organic agriculture can contribute to ecological sustainability, especially in poorer countries. The application of organic principles enables employment of local resources (e.g., local seed varieties, manure, etc.) and therefore cost-effectiveness. Local and international markets for organic products show tremendous growth prospects and offer creative producers and exporters excellent opportunities to improve their income and living conditions. Organic agriculture is knowledge intensive. Globally, capacity building efforts are underway, including localized training material, to limited effect. As of 2007, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements hosted more than 170 free manuals and 75 training opportunities online. In 2008 the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) stated that \\"organic agriculture can be more conducive to food security in Africa than most conventional production systems, and that it is more likely to be sustainable in the long-term\\"UNEP-UNCTAD. (2008). Organic Agriculture and Food Security in Africa. United Nations. Free full-text. and that \\"yields had more than doubled where organic, or near-organic practices had been used\\" and that soil fertility and drought resistance improved.Howden D. Organic farming 'could feed Africa'. The Independent.  Millennium Development Goals  The value of organic agriculture (OA) in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), particularly in poverty reduction efforts in the face of climate change, is shown by its contribution to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These benefits are expected to continue in the post-MDG era. A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes, improved farmers' health owing to less chemical exposure, integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies, improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains.

A related ADBI study also sheds on the costs of OA programs and set them in the context of the costs of attaining the MDGs. The results show considerable variation across the case studies, suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA. Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs. The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones. However, further analysis of the gains resulting from OA adoption reveals that the costs per person taken out of poverty was much lower than the estimates of the World Bank,World Bank. 2008. Global Monitoring Report 2008: MDGs and the Environment: Agenda for Inclusive and Sustainable Development.

Manila: ADB. = Externalities = Agriculture imposes negative externalities (uncompensated costs) upon society through public land and other public resource use, biodiversity loss, erosion, pesticides, nutrient runoff, subsidized water usage, subsidy payments and assorted other problems. Positive externalities include self-reliance, entrepreneurship, respect for nature, and air quality. Organic methods reduce some of these costs. In 2000 uncompensated costs for 1996 reached 2,343 million British pounds or ¬£208 per ha (¬£84.20/ac). A study of practices in the US published in 2005 concluded that cropland costs the economy approximately 5 to 16 billion dollars ($30‚Äì96/ha ‚Äì $12‚Äì39/ac), while livestock production costs 714 million dollars. Both studies recommended reducing externalities. The 2000 review included reported pesticide poisonings but did not include speculative chronic health effects of pesticides, and the 2004 review relied on a 1992 estimate of the total impact of pesticides. It has been proposed that organic agriculture can reduce the level of some negative externalities from (conventional) agriculture. Whether the benefits are private or public depends upon the division of property rights. Several surveys and studies have attempted to examine and compare conventional and organic systems of farming and have found that organic techniques, while not without harm, are less damaging than conventional ones because they reduce levels of biodiversity less than conventional systems do and use less energy and produce less waste when calculated per unit area.Stolze, M.; Piorr, A.; H√§ring, A.M. and Dabbert, S. (2000) Environmental impacts of organic farming in Europe. Organic Farming in Europe: Economics and Policy Vol. 6. Universit√§t Hohenheim, Stuttgart- Hohenheim.  Issues  A 2003 to 2005 investigation by the Cranfield University for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the UK found that it is difficult to compare the Global warming potential, acidification and eutrophication emissions but \\"Organic production often results in increased burdens, from factors such as N leaching and N2O emissions\\", even though primary energy use was less for most organic products. N2O is always the largest global warming potential contributor except in tomatoes. However, \\"organic tomatoes always incur more burdens (except pesticide use)\\". Some emissions were lower \\"per area\\", but organic farming always required 65 to 200% more field area than non-organic farming. The numbers were highest for bread wheat (200+ % more) and potatoes (160% more).Determining the environmental burdens and resource use in the production of agricultural and horticultural commodities , Williams, A.G. et al., Cranfield University, U.K., August 2006. Organic Agriculture Centre of Canada.Determining the environmental burdens and resource use in the production of agricultural and horticultural commodities. - IS0205 , Williams, A.G. et al., Cranfield University, U.K., August 2006. Svensk mat- och milj√∂information. Pages 4-6, 29 and 84-85. = Environmental impact and emissions = Researchers at Oxford University analysed 71 peer-reviewed studies and observed that organic products are sometimes worse for the environment. Organic milk, cereals, and pork generated higher greenhouse gas emissions per product than conventional ones but organic beef and olives had lower emissions in most studies. Usually organic products required less energy, but more land. Per unit of product, organic produce generates higher nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions, ammonia emissions, eutrophication, and acidification potential than conventionally grown produce.Does organic farming reduce environmental impacts? - A meta-analysis of European research, H.L. Tuomisto, I.D. Hodge, P. Riordan & D.W. Macdonald, Authors‚Äô version of the paper published in: Journal of Environmental Management 112 (2012) 309-320 Other differences were not significant. The researchers concluded that public debate should consider various manners of employing conventional or organic farming, and not merely debate conventional farming as opposed to organic farming. They also sought to find specific solutions to specific circumstances. Proponents of organic farming have claimed that organic agriculture emphasizes closed nutrient cycles, biodiversity, and effective soil management providing the capacity to mitigate and even reverse the effects of climate changeMeleca (2008). The Organic Answer to Climate Change. and that organic agriculture can decrease fossil fuel emissions.Rodale Institute 18 April 2014. Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change \\"The carbon sequestration efficiency of organic systems in temperate climates is almost double (575‚Äì700 kg carbon per ha per year ‚Äì 510‚Äì625 lb/ac/an ) that of conventional treatment of soils, mainly owing to the use of grass clovers for feed and of cover crops in organic rotations.\\"UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy Critics of organic farming methods believe that the increased land needed to farm organic food could potentially destroy the rainforests and wipe out many ecosystems. = Nutrient leaching = According to a 2012 meta-analysis of 71 studies, nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions, ammonia emissions, eutrophication potential and acidification potential were higher for organic products, although in one study \\"nitrate leaching was 4.4‚Äì5.6 times higher in conventional plots than organic plots\\". Excess nutrients in lakes, rivers, and groundwater can cause algal blooms, eutrophication, and subsequent dead zones. In addition, nitrates are harmful to aquatic organisms by themselves. = Land use = The Oxford meta-analysis of 71 studies found that organic farming requires 84% more land for an equivalent amount of harvest, mainly due to lack of nutrients but sometimes due to weeds, diseases or pests, lower yielding animals and land required for fertility building crops. While organic farming does not necessarily save land for wildlife habitats and forestry in all cases, the most modern breakthroughs in organic are addressing these issues with success. Professor Wolfgang Branscheid says that organic animal production is not good for the environment, because organic chicken requires twice as much land as \\"conventional\\" chicken and organic pork a quarter more.Experte zur Nachhaltigkeit in der Landwirtschaft: ‚ÄûBio ist auch keine L√∂sung\\", Westf√§lischen Nachrichten, 19 November 2012. According to a calculation by Hudson Institute, organic beef requires three times as much land.The Environmental Safety and Benefits of Growth Enhancing Pharmaceutical Technologies in Beef Production , Alex Avery and Dennis Avery, Hudson Institute, Center for Global Food Issues, Figure 5, page 22. On the other hand, certain organic methods of animal husbandry have been shown to restore desertified, marginal, and/or otherwise unavailable land to agricultural productivity and wildlife. Or by getting both forage and cash crop production from the same fields simultaneously, reduce net land use. In England organic farming yields 55% of normal yields.Organic farming shows limited benefit to wildlife, University of Leeds, 5 May 2010. In other regions of the world, organic methods have started producing record yields. = Pesticides = A sign outside of an organic apple orchard in Pateros, Washington reminding orchardists not to spray pesticides on these trees In organic farming synthetic pesticides are generally prohibited. A chemical is said to be synthetic if it does not already exist in the natural world. But the organic label goes further and usually prohibit compounds that exist in nature if they are produced by chemical synthesis. So the prohibition is also about the method of production and not only the nature of the compound. A non-exhaustive list of organic approved pesticides with their median lethal doses: * Boric acid is used as an insecticide (LD50: 2660 mg/kg). * Bromomethane is a gas that is still used in the nurseries of strawberry organic farming * Copper(II) sulfate is used as a fungicide and is also used in conventional agriculture (LD50 300 mg/kg). Conventional agriculture has the option to use the less toxic Mancozeb (LD50 4,500 to 11,200 mg/kg) * Lime sulfur (aka calcium polysulfide) and sulfur are considered to be allowed, synthetic materialshttp://web.pppmb.cals.cornell.edu/resourceguide/pdf/resource-guide- for-organic-insect-and-disease-management.pdf (LD50: 820 mg/kg) * Neem oil is used as an insect repellant in India; since it contains azadirachtin its use is restricted in the UK and Europe. * Pyrethrin comes from chemicals extracted from flowers of the genus Pyrethrum (LD50 of 370 mg/kg). Its potent toxicity is used to control insects. * Rotenone is a powerful insecticide that was used to control insects (LD50: 132 mg/kg). Despite the high toxicity of Rotenone to aquatic life and some links to Parkinson disease the compound is still allowed in organic farming as it is a naturally occurring compound. = Food quality and safety = While there may be some differences in the amounts of nutrients and anti-nutrients when organically produced food and conventionally produced food are compared, the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results, and there is insufficient evidence to make claims that organic food is safer or healthier than conventional food.Blair, Robert. (2012). Organic Production and Food Quality: A Down to Earth Analysis. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, UK. Claims that organic food tastes better are not supported by evidence. = Soil conservation = Supporters claim that organically managed soil has a higher quality and higher water retention.Hepperly, P. and S. Setboonsarng. \\"Carbon Sequestration in Organic Agriculture and Climate Change: A Path to a Brighter Future.\\" In Organic Agriculture and Post-2015 Development Goals: Building on the Comparative Advantage of Poor Farmers. Ed. Setboonsarng, S. and A. Markandya. pp 293-322. 2015. Manila: ADB. http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/161042/organic-agriculture- and-post-2015-development-goals. This may help increase yields for organic farms in drought years. Organic farming can build up soil organic matter better than conventional no-till farming, which suggests long-term yield benefits from organic farming.ARS (2007) Organic Farming Beats No-Till? An 18-year study of organic methods on nutrient-depleted soil concluded that conventional methods were superior for soil fertility and yield for nutrient- depleted soils in cold-temperate climates, arguing that much of the benefit from organic farming derives from imported materials that could not be regarded as self-sustaining. In Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations, geomorphologist David Montgomery outlines a coming crisis from soil erosion. Agriculture relies on roughly one meter of topsoil, and that is being depleted ten times faster than it is being replaced.Seattle PI (2008). The lowdown on topsoil: it's disappearing No-till farming, which some claim depends upon pesticides, is one way to minimize erosion. However, a 2007 study by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service has found that manure applications in tilled organic farming are better at building up the soil than no- till.Hepperly, Paul, Jeff Moyer, and Dave Wilson. \\"Developments in Organic No- till Agriculture.\\" Acres USA: The Voice of Eco-agriculture September 2008: 16-19. And Roberts, Paul. \\"The End of Food: Investigating a Global Crisis.\\" Interview with Acres USA. Acres USA: The Voice of Eco-Agriculture October 2008: 56-63. = Biodiversity = The conservation of natural resources and biodiversity is a core principle of organic production. Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife. Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.\\"USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation\\"(PDF). Agricultural Marketing Service, National Organic Program. United States Department of Agriculture. 15 January 2016. Retrieved 5 March2016. Nearly all non-crop, naturally occurring Institut de recherche de l'agriculture biologique, ¬´ 100 arguments en faveur de l‚Äôagriculture biologique ¬ª , second edition, September 2015 (page visited on 8 November 2015). species observed in comparative farm land practice studies show a preference for organic farming both by abundance and diversity. An average of 30% more species inhabit organic farms. Birds, butterflies, soil microbes, beetles, earthworms, spiders, vegetation, and mammals are particularly affected. Lack of herbicides and pesticides improve biodiversity fitness and population density. Many weed species attract beneficial insects that improve soil qualities and forage on weed pests. Soil-bound organisms often benefit because of increased bacteria populations due to natural fertilizer such as manure, while experiencing reduced intake of herbicides and pesticides. Increased biodiversity, especially from beneficial soil microbes and mycorrhizae have been proposed as an explanation for the high yields experienced by some organic plots, especially in light of the differences seen in a 21-year comparison of organic and control fields. Biodiversity from organic farming provides capital to humans. Species found in organic farms enhance sustainability by reducing human input (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides). The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) published a Federal Register notice on 15 January 2016, announcing the National Organic Program (NOP) final guidance on Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation for Certified Organic Operations. Given the broad scope of natural resources which includes soil, water, wetland, woodland and wildlife, the guidance provides examples of practices that support the underlying conservation principles and demonstrate compliance with USDA organic regulations ¬ß 205.200. The final guidance provides organic certifiers and farms with examples of production practices that support conservation principles and comply with the USDA organic regulations, which require operations to maintain or improve natural resources. The final guidance also clarifies the role of certified operations (to submit an OSP to a certifier), certifiers (ensure that the OSP describes or lists practices that explain the operator's monitoring plan and practices to support natural resources and biodiversity conservation), and inspectors (onsite inspection) in the implementation and verification of these production practices. A wide range of organisms benefit from organic farming, but it is unclear whether organic methods confer greater benefits than conventional integrated agri- environmental programs. Organic farming is often presented as a more biodiversity-friendly practice, but the generality of the beneficial effects of organic farming is debated as the effects appear often species- and context-dependent, and current research has highlighted the need to quantify the relative effects of local- and landscape-scale management on farmland biodiversity. There are four key issues when comparing the impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional farming: (1) It remains unclear whether a holistic whole-farm approach (i.e. organic) provides greater benefits to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to relatively small areas of cropped and/or non-cropped habitats within conventional agriculture (i.e. agri-environment schemes); (2) Many comparative studies encounter methodological problems, limiting their ability to draw quantitative conclusions; (3) Our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is limited; (4) There remains a pressing need for longitudinal, system-level studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming, before a full appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems can be made. = Opposition to labour standards = Organic agriculture is often considered to be more socially just and economically sustainable for farmworkers than conventional agriculture. However, there is little social science research or consensus as to whether or not organic agriculture provides better working conditions than conventional agriculture. As many consumers equate organic and sustainable agriculture with small-scale, family-owned organizations it is widely interpreted that buying organic supports better conditions for farmworkers than buying with conventional producers. Organic agriculture is generally more labour-intensive due to its dependence on manual practices for fertilization and pest removal and relies heavily upon hired, non-family farmworkers rather than family members. Although illnesses from synthetic inputs pose less of a risk, hired workers still fall victim to debilitating musculoskeletal disorders associated with agricultural work. The USDA certification requirements outline growing practices and ecological standards but do nothing to codify labour practices. Independent certification initiatives such as the Agricultural Justice Project, Domestic Fair Trade Working Group, and the Food Alliance have attempted to implement farmworker interests but because these initiatives require voluntary participation of organic farms, their standards cannot be widely enforced. Despite the benefit to farmworkers of implementing labour standards, there is little support among the organic community for these social requirements. Many actors of the organic industry believe that enforcing labour standards would be unnecessary, unacceptable, or unviable due to the constraints of the market.  Regional support for organic farming  =China= The Chinese government, especially the local government, has provided various supports for the development of organic agriculture since the 1990s. Organic farming has been recognized by local governments for its potential in promoting sustainable rural development.Aijuan Chen. (2015). China‚Äôs Path in Developing Organic Agriculture: Opportunities and Implications for Small-scale Farmers and Rural Development PhD Thesis, University of Waterloo It is common for local governments to facilitate land access of agribusinesses by negotiating land leasing with local farmers. The government also establishes demonstration organic gardens, provides training for organic food companies to pass certifications, subsidizes organic certification fees, pest repellent lamps, organic fertilizer and so on. The government has also been playing an active role in marketing organic products through organizing organic food expos and branding supports.Steffanie Scott, Zhenzhong Si, Theresa Schumilas and Aijuan Chen.

Other states of India, including Kerala, Mizoram, Goa, Rajasthan, and Meghalaya, have also declared their intentions to shift to fully organic cultivation. The South Indian state Andhra Pradesh is also promoting organic farming, especially Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) which is a form of regenerative agriculture.Balk, Sabine; Dembowski, Hans; Thallam, Vijay Kumar. \\"Four wheels of Zero Budget Natural Farming\\", D+C - Development + Cooperation, 10 November 2019. As of 2018, India has the largest number of organic farmers in the world and constitutes to more than 30% of the organic farmers globally. India has 835,000 certified organic producers. =Dominican Republic= The Dominican Republic has successfully converted a large amount of its banana crop to organic. The Dominican Republic accounts for 55% of the world's certified organic bananas. = Thailand = In Thailand, the Institute for Sustainable Agricultural Communities (ISAC) was established in 1991 to promote organic farming (among other sustainable agricultural practices). The national target via the National Plan for Organic Farming is to attain, by 2021, 1.3 million rai of organically farmed land. Another target is for 40% of the produce from these farmlands to be consumed domestically. Much progress has been made: * Many organic farms have sprouted, growing produce ranging from mangosteen to stinky bean * Some of the farms have also established education centres to promote and share their organic farming techniques and knowledge * In Chiang Mai Province, there are 18 organic markets (ISAC-linked)  See also  * Advance sowing * Agroecology * Biodynamic agriculture * Biointensive * Biological pest control * Certified Naturally Grown * Do Nothing Farming * French intensive gardening * Holistic management (agriculture) * List of organic food topics * List of organic gardening and farming topics * List of companion plants * List of pest-repelling plants * List of beneficial weeds * Natural Farming * No-till farming * Organic clothing * Organic farming by country * Organic Farming Digest * Organic movement * Permaculture * SRI * Organic food culture * Zero Budget Farming  References   Further reading   Avery, A.

A part of BBC Radio, it broadcasts a wide variety of spoken-word programmes including news, drama, comedy, science and history from the BBC's headquarters at Broadcasting House, London. It replaced the BBC Home Service in 1967. The station controller is Mohit Bakaya. Radio 4 the second- most popular domestic radio station in the United Kingdom after BBC Radio 2, broadcasting throughout the UK, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands on FM, LW and DAB, and can be received in the eastern counties of Ireland, the north of France and Northern Europe. It is also available through Freeview, Sky, Virgin Media and on BBC Sounds. Its sister station, BBC Radio 4 Extra, complements the main channel by broadcasting repeats from the Radio 4 archive, extended versions of Radio 4 programmes and supplements to series such as The Archers and Desert Island Discs. Radio 4 is notable for its news bulletins and programmes such as Today and The World at One, heralded on air by the Greenwich Time Signal \\"pips\\" or the chimes of Big Ben. The pips are only accurate on FM, LW, and MW; there is a delay on digital radio of three to five seconds and online up to twenty-three seconds. Radio 4 broadcasts the Shipping Forecast which, in August 2017, was 150-years-old.  Outline  BBC Radio 4 is the second-most-popular British domestic radio station by total hours, after Radio 2 ‚Äì and the most popular in London and the South of England. It recorded its highest audience, of 11 million listeners, in May 2011Guardian 12 May 2011 Retrieved 16 May 2011] and was \\"UK Radio Station of the Year\\" at the 2003, 2004 and 2008 Sony Radio Academy Awards. It also won a Peabody Award in 2002 for File On 4: Export Controls.62nd Annual Peabody Awards, May 2003. Costing ¬£71.4 million (2005/6), it is the BBC's most expensive national radio network and is considered by many to be its flagship. There is no comparable British commercial network: Channel 4 abandoned plans to launch its own speech-based digital radio station in October 2008 as part of a ¬£100m cost cutting review. In 2019, Mohit Bakaya replaced Gwyneth Williams, who had been the station controller since 2010.\\"Gwyneth Williams appointed BBC Radio 4 controller\\" The Guardian, 15 July 2010, Retrieved 15 July 2010 Music and sport are the only fields that largely fall outside the station's remit. It broadcasts occasional concerts, and documentaries related to various forms of both popular and classical music, and the long-running music-based Desert Island Discs. Prior to the creation of BBC Radio 5 it broadcast sports-based features, notably Sport on Four, and since the creation of BBC Radio 5 Live in 1994, the station has become the home of ball-by-ball commentaries of most Test cricket matches played by England. The coverage is broadcast on long wave. Consequently, for around 70 days a year, listeners have to rely on FM broadcasts or increasingly DAB for mainstream Radio 4 broadcasts ‚Äì the number relying solely on long wave is now a small minority. The cricket broadcasts take precedence over on-the-hour news bulletins, but not the Shipping Forecast, carried since its move to long wave in 1978 because that can be received clearly at sea. The station is the UK's national broadcaster in times of national emergency such as war, due to the wide coverage of the Droitwich signal: if all other radio stations were forced to close, it would carry on broadcasting. It has been claimed that the commanders of nuclear-armed submarines believing that Britain had suffered nuclear attack were required to check if they could still receive Radio 4 on 198 long wave, and if they could not they would open sealed orders that might authorise a retaliatory strike.\\"Radio silence puts subs on nuclear alert\\" 28 November 2003 Manchester Evening News Retrieved 11 February 2018 As well as news and drama, the station has a strong reputation for comedy, including experimental and alternative comedy, many successful comedians and comedy shows first appearing on the station. Following the six o'clock news from Monday to Friday, the station normally broadcasts a thirty-minute comedy programme. The station is available on FM in most of Great Britain, parts of Ireland and the north of France; LW throughout the UK and in parts of Northern Europe, and the Atlantic north of the Azores to about 20 degrees west; MW in some areas; DAB; Digital TV including Freeview, Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media, and on the Internet. Freesat, Sky and Virgin have a separate channel which broadcasts the Radio 4 LW output in mono, in addition to the FM output. The longwave signal is part of the Royal Navy's system of Last Resort Letters. In the event of a suspected catastrophic attack on Britain, submarine captains, in addition to other checks, check for a broadcast signal from Radio 4 on 198 longwave to verify the annihilation of organised society in Great Britain.  History  Logo of Radio 4 until 2007 The BBC Home Service was the predecessor of Radio 4 and broadcast between 1939 and 1967. It had regional variations and was broadcast on medium wave with a network of VHF FM transmitters being added from 1955. Radio 4 replaced it on 30 September 1967, when the BBC renamed many of its domestic radio stations, in response to the challenge of offshore radio. It moved to long wave in November 1978, taking over the 200 kHz frequency (1500 metres) previously held by Radio 2 - later moved to 198 kHz as a result of international agreements aimed at avoiding interference (all UK MW/LW frequencies are divisible by 9). At this point, Radio 4 became available across all of the UK for the first time and the station officially became known as Radio 4 UK, a title that remained until September 1984. For a time during the 1970s Radio 4 carried regional news bulletins Monday to Saturday. These were broadcast twice at breakfast, at lunchtime and at 5.55p.m. There were also programme variations for the parts of England not served by BBC Local Radio stations. These included Roundabout East Anglia, a VHF opt-out of the Today programme broadcast from BBC East's studios in Norwich each weekday from 6.45 a.m. to 8.45 a.m. Roundabout East Anglia came to an end in mid-1980 ahead of the launch of BBC Radio Norfolk. All regional news bulletins broadcast from BBC regional news bases around England ended in August 1980, apart from in the south west as until January 1983 there was no BBC Local Radio in the south west so these news bulletins and its weekday morning regional programme, Morning Sou'West, continued to be broadcast from the BBC studios in Plymouth on VHF and on the Radio 4 medium wave Plymouth relay until 31 December 1982. The launch of Radio 5 on 27 August 1990 saw the removal of Open University, schools programming, children's programmes and the Study on 4/Options adult education slot from Radio 4's FM frequencies. Consequently, the full Radio 4 schedule became available on FM for the first time. However, adult educational and Open University programming returned to Radio 4 in 1994 when Radio 5 was closed to make way for the launch of BBC Radio 5 Live and were broadcast on Sunday evenings on longwave only. Between 17 January 1991 and 2 March 1991 FM broadcasts were replaced by a continuous news service devoted to the Gulf War, Radio 4 News FM, with the main Radio 4 service being exclusively on longwave. In September 1991 it was decided that the main Radio 4 service would be on FM as FM coverage had now extended to cover almost all of the UK - Radio 4 didn't become available on FM in much of Scotland and Wales until the early 1990s. Opt-outs were transferred to longwave: currently Test Match Special, extra shipping forecasts, The Daily Service and Yesterday in Parliament. Longwave very occasionally opts out at other times, such as to broadcast special services, the most recent being when Pope Benedict XVI visited Britain in 2010.  Programmes and schedules  = Daily schedule = An online schedule page lists the running order of programmes. = Production = Many programmes are pre-recorded. Programmes transmitted live include Today, magazine programme Woman's Hour, consumer affairs programme You and Yours, and (often) the music, film, books, arts and culture programme Front Row. Continuity is managed from Broadcasting House with news bulletins, including the hourly summaries and longer programmes such as the Six O'Clock News and Midnight News, and news programmes such as Today, The World at One and PM, which by early 2013 had returned to Broadcasting House after 15 years at BBC Television Centre in White City. The news returning to Broadcasting House has also meant that newsreaders can provide cover for continuity, which regularly occurs at 23:00 each night and 16:00 on a Sunday. This has reduced the total number of continuity announcers required each day down from four to three. The Time Signal, known as 'the pips', is broadcast every hour to herald the news bulletin, except at midnight and 18:00, where the chimes of Big Ben are played. There is no Greenwich Time Signal during the Saturday Afternoon Drama at 15:00 on Radio 4 on Saturdays either. Only pips broadcast on FM/MW/LW are accurate. On all digital platforms they are in delay by between 3 and 5 seconds and even longer online (up to 23 seconds). = Programmes = Radio 4 programmes cover a wide variety of genre including news and current affairs, history, culture, science, religion, arts, drama and light entertainment. A number of the programmes on Radio 4 take the form of a \\"magazine\\" show, featuring numerous small contributions over the course of the programme‚ÄîWoman's Hour, From Our Own Correspondent, You and Yours. The rise of these magazine shows is primarily due to the work of Tony Whitby, controller of Radio 4 from 1970 to 1975. The station hosts a number of long-running programmes, many of which have been broadcast for over 40 years. Most programmes are available for four weeks after broadcast as streaming audio from Radio 4's listen again page and via BBC iPlayer. A selection of programmes is also available as podcasts or downloadable audio files. Many comedy and drama programmes from the Radio 4 archives are rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra (formerly BBC Radio 7). Due to the capacity limitations of DAB and increasing sport broadcasts on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Radio 4 DAB has to reduce its bit rate most evenings, such that after 7p.m. its DAB output is usually in mono, even though many of its programmes are made in stereo (including its flagship drama \\"The Archers\\"), these can be heard in stereo only on FM, Digital TV on Freeview & Freesat (Ch. 704), Sky, Virgin and on line via BBC iPlayer radio. BBC World Service, which uses BBC Radio 4 FM & DAB frequencies between 01:00 and 05:20, is in stereo, but only on Radio 4 FM & DAB and not on its own dedicated DAB channel. BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcasts in mono on DAB, but has always been in stereo on Digital TV (Freeview / Freesat Ch 708), Sky, Virgin and online.  Notable continuity announcers and newsreaders  Announcers carry out the following duties from Broadcasting House: * Provide links (or junctions) between programmes * Read trails for programmes * Provide reassurance to listeners during a programme breakdown * Read the Shipping Forecast (except the 05:20 broadcast, which is covered by BBC Weather) * Read the BBC Radio 3 news summaries at 13:00, 17:00 and 18:00 on weekdays Newsreaders read hourly summaries and longer bulletins from New Broadcasting House.

Conversely, the journalist Mehdi Hasan has criticised the station for an overtly \\"socially and culturally conservative\\" approach. There has been frequent criticism of Radio 4‚Äîand Today in particular‚Äîfor a lack of female broadcasters. In September 1972, Radio 4 employed the first female continuity announcers‚ÄîHylda Bamber and Barbara Edwards (an event which caused the Daily Mail to proclaim that Radio 4 had \\"fallen\\" to women's liberation). For quite some time, the introduction of female newsreaders led to complaints from listeners; women discussing topics of feminist interest led to similar complaints. Radio 4 has also been frequently criticised for being too middle class and being of little interest to non-white listeners.

The walls enclosed an area of about 1 square kilometre The area enclosed by the walls of many European medieval cities were about one square kilometre. These walls are often either still standing or the route they followed is still clearly visible, such as in Brussels, where the wall has been replaced by a ring road, or in Frankfurt, where the wall has been replaced by gardens. The approximate area of the old walled cities can often be worked out by fitting the course of the wall to a rectangle or an oval (ellipse). Examples include *Delft, Netherlands (See map alongside) :The walled city of Delft was approximately rectangular. ::The approximate length of rectangle was about .Measurements taken from Google Earth ::The approximate width of the rectangle was about . ::A perfect rectangle with these measurements has an area of 1.30√ó0.75 = 0.9 km2 *Lucca (Italy) :The medieval city is roughly rectangular with rounded north-east and north-west corners. ::The maximum distance from east to west is . ::The maximum distance from north to south is . ::A perfect rectangle of these dimensions would be 1.36√ó0.80 = 1.088 km2. *Brugge (Belgium) :The medieval city of Brugge, a major centre in Flanders, was roughly oval or elliptical in shape with the longer or semi-major axis running north and south. ::The maximum distance from north to south (semi-major axis) is . ::The maximum distance from east to west (semi-minor axis) is . ::A perfect ellipse of these dimensions would be 2.53 √ó 1.81 √ó (œÄ/4) = 3.597 km2. *Chester United Kingdom :Chester is one of the smaller English cities that has a near-intact city wall. ::The distance from Northgate to Watergate is about 855 metres. ::The distance from Eastgate to Westgate is about 589 metres. ::A perfect rectangle of these dimensions would be (855/1000) √ó (589/1000) = 0.504 km2. =Parks= Parks come in all sizes; a few are almost exactly one square kilometre in area.

In 1945, the eastern part of the city of G√∂rlitz was split off and became known as Zgorzelec when the Polish-German border was redrawn. Because of his knowledge of Polish, Scholz was able to remain in Zgorzelec, but he chose to leave in 1946 when Germans who remained in the city were forced to adopt Polish citizenship. Scholz went to the nearby city of Cottbus, but when it became part of the German Democratic Republic in 1949, he moved to West Germany. There, Scholz taught many classes dealing with morals and theology and he received many honors, including Papal Honorary Titles. Professor Scholz was a theologian with many years of practical experience with parishioners and inmates, and he had experience with Polish life and people. He left a large volume of written material.

Some invertebrates such as beetles and spiders have somewhat similar fine, hooked structures at the end of the leg or tarsus for gripping a surface as they walk. The pincers of crabs, lobsters and scorpions, more formally known as their chelae, are sometimes called claws. A true claw is made of a hard protein called keratin. Claws are used to catch and hold prey in carnivorous mammals such as cats and dogs but may also be used for such purposes as digging, climbing trees, self-defense and grooming, in those and other species. Similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead. Claw-like projections that do not form at the end of digits but spring from other parts of the foot are properly named spurs. Tetrapods In tetrapods, claws are made of keratin and consist of two layers. The unguis is the harder external layer, which consists of keratin fibers arranged perpendicular to the direction of growth and in layers at an oblique angle. The subunguis is the softer, flaky underside layer whose grain is parallel to the direction of growth. The claw grows outward from the nail matrix at the base of the unguis and the subunguis grows thicker while travelling across the nail bed. The unguis grows outward faster than the subunguis to produce a curve and the thinner sides of the claw wear away faster than their thicker middle, producing a more or less sharp point. Tetrapods use their claws in many ways, commonly to grasp or kill prey, to dig and to climb and hang. =Mammals= A claw sheath from a cat All carnivorans have claws, which vary considerably in length and shape. Claws grow out of the third phalanges of the paws and are made of keratin. Many predatory mammals have protractile claws that can partially hide inside the animal's paw, especially the cat family, Felidae, almost all of whose members have fully protractible claws. Outside of the cat family, retractable claws are found only in certain species of the Viverridae (and the extinct Nimravidae).Anton, Mauricio (1997). The Big Cats and Their Fossil Relatives. Columbia University Press. pp. 130-33. . A claw that is retractable is protected from wear and tear. Most cats and dogs also have a dewclaw on the inside of the front paws. It is much less functional than the other claws but does help the cats to grasp prey. Because the dew claw does not touch the ground, it receives less wear and tends to be sharper and longer. A nail is homologous to a claw but is flatter and has a curved edge instead of a point. A nail that is big enough to bear weight is called a \\"hoof\\". (Nevertheless, one side of the cloven-hoof of artiodactyl ungulates may also be called a claw). Every so often, the growth of claws stops and restarts, as does hair. In a hair, this results in the hair falling out and being replaced by a new one. In claws, this results in an abscission layer, and the old segment breaks off. This process takes several months for human thumbnails. Cats are often seen working old unguis layers off on wood or on boards made for the purpose. Ungulates' hooves wear or self-trim by ground contact. Domesticated equids (horses, donkeys and mules) usually need regular trimming by a farrier, as a consequence of reduced activity on hard ground. Primates Primate nails consist of the unguis alone, as the subunguis has disappeared. With the evolution of grasping hands and feet, claws are no longer necessary for locomotion, and instead most digits exhibit nails. However, claw-like nails are found in small-bodied callitrichids on all digits except the hallux or big toe. A laterally flattened grooming claw, used for grooming, can be found on the second toe in living strepsirrhines, and the second and third in tarsiers. Aye-ayes have functional claws on all other digits except the hallux, including a grooming claw on the second toe. Less commonly known, a grooming claw is also found on the second pedal digit of night monkeys (Aotus), titis (Callicebus), and possibly other New World monkeys. =Reptiles= At just under a meter, the claws of Therizinosaurus are among the largest recorded. green lizard basks. Most reptiles have well- developed claws. Most lizards have toes ending in stout claws, forming from the last scale on the toe. In snakes, feet and claws are absent, but in many boids such as Boa constrictor, remnants of highly reduced hind-limbs emerge with a single claw as \\"spurs\\" on each side of the anal opening. Lizard claws are used as aids in climbing, and in holding down prey in carnivorous species. =Birds= A talon is the claw of a bird of prey, its primary hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey would not be able to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for defensive purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.Sir Walter Lawry Buller (1888): A History of the Birds of New Zealand.

Fundamentalists argued that 19th-century modernist theologians had misinterpreted or rejected certain doctrines, especially biblical inerrancy, which they considered the fundamentals of the Christian faith.Sandeen (1970), p. 6 Fundamentalists are almost always described as having a literal interpretation of the Bible. A few scholars label Catholics who reject modern theology in favor of more traditional doctrines fundamentalists. Scholars debate how much the terms evangelical and fundamentalist are synonymous. summarizes the debate. In keeping with traditional Christian doctrines concerning biblical interpretation, the role of Jesus in the Bible, and the role of the church in society, fundamentalists usually believe in a core of Christian beliefs which include the historical accuracy of the Bible and all of the events which are recorded in it as well as the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Interpretations of Christian fundamentalism have changed over time. Fundamentalism as a movement manifested itself in various denominations which believed in various theologies, rather than a single denomination or a systematic theology. It became active in the 1910s after the release of The Fundamentals, a twelve- volume set of essays, apologetic and polemic, written by conservative Protestant theologians in an attempt to defend beliefs which they considered Protestant orthodoxy. The movement became more organized within U.S. Protestant churches in the 1920s, especially among Baptists and Presbyterians. Many churches which embraced fundamentalism adopted a militant attitude with regard to their core beliefs and they also combined Princeton theology with Dispensationalism. Since 1930, many fundamentalist churches have been represented by the Independent Fundamental Churches of America (renamed IFCA International in 1996), which holds to biblical inerrancy.  Terminology  The term fundamentalism was coined by Baptist editor Curtis Lee Laws in 1920 in order to designate Protestants who were ready \\"to do battle royal for the fundamentals\\". The term was quickly adopted by all sides. Laws borrowed it from the title of a series of essays published between 1910 and 1915 called The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth. The term \\"fundamentalism\\" entered the English language in 1922, and it is often capitalized when it is used to refer to the religious movement. The term fundamentalist is controversial in the 21st century, because it connotes religious extremism, especially when such labeling is applied beyond the movement which coined the term or beyond those who self-identify as fundamentalists today. Some who hold certain, but not all beliefs in common with the original fundamentalist movement reject the label \\"fundamentalism\\", because they consider it too pejorative, while others consider it a banner of pride. Such Christians prefer to use the term fundamental, as opposed to fundamentalist (e.g., Independent Fundamental Baptist and Independent Fundamental Churches of America). The term is sometimes confused with Christian legalism. In parts of the United Kingdom, using the term fundamentalist with the intent to stir up religious hatred is a violation of the Racial and Religious Hatred Act of 2006.  Origins  Fundamentalism came from multiple streams in British and American theologies during the 19th century.Sandeen (1970), ch 1 According to authors Robert D. Woodberry and Christian S. Smith, However, the split does not mean that there were just two groups, modernists and fundamentalists. There were also people who considered themselves neo-evangelicals, separating themselves from the extreme components of fundamentalism. These neo-evangelicals also wanted to separate themselves from both the fundamentalist movement and the mainstream evangelical movement due to their anti-intellectual approaches. = Evangelicalism = The first important stream was Evangelicalism which emerged in the revivals of the First and Second Great Awakenings in America and the Methodist movement in England in the period from 1730‚Äì1840. They in turn were influenced by the Pietist movement in Germany. Church historian Randall Balmer explains that: = Dispensationalism = A second stream was Dispensationalism, a new interpretation of the Bible developed in the 1830s in England. John Nelson Darby's ideas were disseminated by the notes and commentaries in the widely used Scofield Reference Bible, published in 1909. Dispensationalism was a millenarian theory that divided all of time into seven different stages, called \\"dispensations\\", which were seen as stages of God's revelation. At the end of each stage, according to this theory, God punished the particular peoples who were involved in each dispensation for their failure to fulfill the requirements which they were under during its duration. Increasing secularism, liberalism, and immorality in the 1920s were believed to be signs that humanity had again failed God's test. Dispensationalists held to a form of eschatology which advocated the belief that the world was on the verge of the last stage, known as the Great Tribulation in which a final battle will take place at Armageddon (the valley of Megiddo), followed by Christ's return, his 1,000-year reign on earth, a final rebellion and then a final judgment, after which all mankind, devils and angels will be divided into either Heaven or the Lake of Fire. = Princeton Theology (biblical inerrancy) = Princeton Seminary in the 1800s A third stream was Princeton Theology, which responded to higher criticism of the Bible by developing from the 1840s to 1920 the doctrine of inerrancy. This doctrine, also called biblical inerrancy, stated that the Bible was divinely inspired, religiously authoritative, and without error.Marsden (1980), pp 109‚Äì118Sandeen (1970) pp 103‚Äì31 The Princeton Seminary professor of Theology Charles Hodge insisted that the Bible was inerrant because God inspired or \\"breathed\\" his exact thoughts into the biblical writers (2 Timothy 3:16). Princeton theologians believed that the Bible should be read differently from any other historical document, and they also believed that Christian modernism and liberalism led people to Hell just like non-Christian religions. Biblical inerrancy was a particularly significant rallying point for fundamentalists. This approach to the Bible is associated with conservative evangelical hermeneutical approaches to Scripture ranging from the historical-grammatical method to biblical literalism.Beyond Biblical Literalism and Inerrancy: Conservative Protestants and the Hermeneutic Interpretation of Scripture, John Bartkowski, Sociology of Religion, 57, 1996. = The Fundamentals and modernism = A fourth stream‚Äîthe immediate spark‚Äîwas the 12-volume study The Fundamentals, published 1910‚Äì1915.Sandeen (1970) pp 188‚Äì207 Sponsors subsidized the free distribution of over three million individual volumes to clergy, laymen and libraries. It stressed several core beliefs, including: * The inerrancy of the Bible * The literal nature of the biblical accounts, especially regarding Christ's miracles and the Creation account in Genesis * The virgin birth of Christ * The bodily resurrection and physical return of Christ * The substitutionary atonement of Christ on the cross Like Princeton Theology, The Fundamentals reflected growing opposition among many evangelical Christians towards higher criticism of the Bible and modernism.  Changing interpretations  A Christian demonstrator preaching at Bele Chere The interpretations given the fundamentalist movement have changed over time, with most older interpretations being based on the concepts of social displacement or cultural lag.Reid, D. G., Linder, R. D., Shelley, B. L., & Stout, H. S. (1990). In Dictionary of Christianity in America. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press. Entry on Fundamentalism Some in the 1930s, including H. Richard Niebuhr, understood the conflict between fundamentalism and modernism to be part of a broader social conflict between the cities and the country. In this view the fundamentalists were country and small-town dwellers who were reacting against the progressivism of city dwellers. Fundamentalism was seen as a form of anti- intellectualism during the 1950s; in the early 1960s American intellectual and historian Richard Hofstadter interpreted it in terms of status anxiety. Beginning in the late 1960s, the movement began to be seen as \\"a bona fide religious, theological and even intellectual movement in its own right.\\" Instead of interpreting fundamentalism as a simple anti-intellectualism, Paul Carter argued that \\"fundamentalists were simply intellectual in a way different than their opponents.\\" Moving into the 1970s, Earnest R. Sandeen saw fundamentalism as arising from the confluence of Princeton Theology and millennialism. George Marsden defined fundamentalism as \\"militantly anti- modernist Protestant evangelicalism\\" in his 1980 work Fundamentalism and American Culture. \\"Militant\\" in this sense does not mean \\"violent\\", it means \\"aggressively active in a cause\\".\\"Militant\\" in Merriam Webster Third Unabridged Dictionary (1961) which cites \\"militant suffragist\\" and \\"militant trade unionism\\" as example. Marsden saw fundamentalism arising from a number of preexisting evangelical movements that responded to various perceived threats by joining forces. He argued that Christian fundamentalists were American evangelical Christians who in the 20th century opposed \\"both modernism in theology and the cultural changes that modernism endorsed. Militant opposition to modernism was what most clearly set off fundamentalism.\\"Marsden (1980), Fundamentalism and American Culture p. 4 Others viewing militancy as a core characteristic of the fundamentalist movement include Philip Melling, Ung Kyu Pak and Ronald Witherup.Philip H. Melling, Fundamentalism in America: millennialism, identity and militant religion (1999). As another scholar points out, \\"One of the major distinctives of fundamentalism is militancy.\\"Ung Kyu Pak, Millennialism in the Korean Protestant Church (2005) p. 211.Ronald D. Witherup, a Catholic scholar, says: \\"Essentially, fundamentalists see themselves as defending authentic Christian religion... The militant aspect helps to explain the desire of fundamentalists to become active in political change.\\" Ronald D. Witherup, Biblical Fundamentalism: What Every Catholic Should Know (2001) p 2 Donald McKim and David Wright (1992) argue that \\"in the 1920s, militant conservatives (fundamentalists) united to mount a conservative counter-offensive. Fundamentalists sought to rescue their denominations from the growth of modernism at home.\\"Donald K. McKim and David F. Wright, Encyclopedia of the Reformed faith (1992) p. 148 According to Marsden, recent scholars differentiate \\"fundamentalists\\" from \\"evangelicals\\" by arguing the former were more militant and less willing to collaborate with groups considered \\"modernist\\" in theology. In the 1940s the more moderate faction of fundamentalists maintained the same theology but began calling themselves \\"evangelicals\\" to stress their less militant position. Roger Olson (2007) identifies a more moderate faction of fundamentalists, which he calls \\"postfundamentalist\\", and says \\"most postfundamentalist evangelicals do not wish to be called fundamentalists, even though their basic theological orientation is not very different.\\" According to Olson, a key event was the formation of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) in 1942.Roger E. Olson, Pocket History of Evangelical Theology (2007) p. 12 Barry Hankins (2008) has a similar view, saying \\"beginning in the 1940s....militant and separatist evangelicals came to be called fundamentalists, while culturally engaged and non-militant evangelicals were supposed to be called evangelicals.\\"Barry Hankins, Francis Schaeffer and the shaping of Evangelical America (2008) p 233 Timothy Weber views fundamentalism as \\"a rather distinctive modern reaction to religious, social and intellectual changes of the late 1800s and early 1900s, a reaction that eventually took on a life of its own and changed significantly over time.\\"  In North America  Fundamentalist movements existed in most North American Protestant denominations by 1919 following attacks on modernist theology in Presbyterian and Baptist denominations. Fundamentalism was especially controversial among Presbyterians. = In Canada = In Canada, fundamentalism was less prominent,John G. Stackhouse, Canadian Evangelicalism in the Twentieth Century (1993) but it had an aggressive leader in English-born Thomas Todhunter Shields (1873‚Äì1955), who led 80 churches out of the Baptist federation in Ontario in 1927 and formed the Union of regular Baptist churches of Ontario and Quebec. He was affiliated with the Baptist Bible Union, based in the United States. His newspaper, The Gospel Witness, reached 30,000 subscribers in 16 countries, giving him an international reputation. He was one of the founders of the international Council of Christian Churches.C. Allyn Russell, \\"Thomas Todhunter Shields: Canadian Fundamentalist,\\" Foundations, 1981, Vol. 24 Issue 1, pp 15‚Äì31 Oswald J. Smith (1889‚Äì1986), reared in rural Ontario and educated at Moody Church in Chicago, set up The Peoples Church in Toronto in 1928. A dynamic preacher and leader in Canadian fundamentalism, Smith wrote 35 books and engaged in missionary work worldwide. Billy Graham called him \\"the greatest combination pastor, hymn writer, missionary statesman, an evangelist of our time\\".David R. Elliott, \\"Knowing No Borders: Canadian Contributions to American Fundamentalism,\\" in George A. Rawlyk and Mark A. Noll, eds., Amazing Grace: Evangelicalism in Australia, Britain, Canada, and the United States (1993) = In the United States = A leading organizer of the fundamentalist campaign against modernism in the United States was William Bell Riley, a Northern Baptist based in Minneapolis, where his Northwestern Bible and Missionary Training School (1902), Northwestern Evangelical Seminary (1935), and Northwestern College (1944) produced thousands of graduates. At a large conference in Philadelphia in 1919, Riley founded the World Christian Fundamentals Association (WCFA), which became the chief interdenominational fundamentalist organization in the 1920s. Some mark this conference as the public start of Christian fundamentalism. Although the fundamentalist drive to take control of the major Protestant denominations failed at the national level during the 1920s, the network of churches and missions fostered by Riley showed that the movement was growing in strength, especially in the U.S. South. Both rural and urban in character, the flourishing movement acted as a denominational surrogate and fostered a militant evangelical Christian orthodoxy. Riley was president of WCFA until 1929, after which the WCFA faded in importance.William Vance Trollinger, Jr. \\"Riley's Empire: Northwestern Bible School and Fundamentalism in the Upper Midwest\\". Church History 1988 57(2): 197‚Äì212. 0009‚Äì6407 The Independent Fundamental Churches of America became a leading association of independent U.S. fundamentalist churches upon its founding in 1930. The American Council of Christian Churches was founded for fundamental Christian denominations as an alternative to the National Council of Churches. J. Gresham Machen Memorial Hall Much of the enthusiasm for mobilizing fundamentalism came from Protestant seminaries and Protestant \\"Bible colleges\\" in the United States. Two leading fundamentalist seminaries were the Dispensationalist Dallas Theological Seminary, founded in 1924 by Lewis Sperry Chafer, and the Reformed Westminster Theological Seminary, formed in 1929 under the leadership and funding of former Princeton Theological Seminary professor J. Gresham Machen. Many Bible colleges were modeled after the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. Dwight Moody was influential in preaching the imminence of the Kingdom of God that was so important to Dispensationalism. Bible colleges prepared ministers who lacked college or seminary experience with intense study of the Bible, often using the Scofield Reference Bible of 1909, a King James Version of the Bible with detailed notes which interprets passages from a Dispensational perspective. Although U.S. fundamentalism began in the North, the movement's largest base of popular support was in the South, especially among Southern Baptists, where individuals (and sometimes entire churches) left the convention and joined other Baptist denominations and movements which they believed were \\"more conservative\\" such as the Independent Baptist movement. By the late 1920s the national media had identified it with the South, largely ignoring manifestations elsewhere.Mary Beth Swetnam Mathews, Rethinking Zion: how the print media placed fundamentalism in the South (2006) page xi In the mid- twentieth century, several Methodists left the mainline Methodist Church and established fundamental Methodist denominations, such as the Evangelical Methodist Church and the Fundamental Methodist Conference (see conservative holiness movement); others preferred congregating in Independent Methodist churches, many of which are affiliated with the Association of Independent Methodists, which is fundamentalist in its theological orientation. By the 1970s Protestant fundamentalism was deeply entrenched and concentrated in the U.S. South. In 1972‚Äì1980 General Social Surveys, 65 percent of respondents from the \\"East South Central\\" region (comprising Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Alabama) self-identified as fundamentalist. The share of fundamentalists was at or near 50 percent in \\"West South Central\\" (Texas to Arkansas) and \\"South Atlantic\\" (Florida to Maryland), and at 25 percent or below elsewhere in the country, with the low of nine percent in New England. The pattern persisted into the 21st century; in 2006‚Äì2010 surveys, the average share of fundamentalists in the East South Central Region stood at 58 percent, while, in New England, it climbed slightly to 13 percent.  Evolution  In the 1920s, Christian fundamentalists \\"differed on how to understand the account of creation in Genesis\\" but they \\"agreed that God was the author of creation and that humans were distinct creatures, separate from animals, and made in the image of God\\". While some of them advocated the belief in Old Earth creationism and a few of them even advocated the belief in evolutionary creation, other \\"strident fundamentalists\\" advocated Young Earth Creationism and \\"associated evolution with last-days atheism\\". These \\"strident fundamentalists\\" in the 1920s devoted themselves to fighting against the teaching of evolution in the nation's schools and colleges, especially by passing state laws that affected public schools. William Bell Riley took the initiative in the 1925 Scopes Trial by bringing in famed politician William Jennings Bryan and hiring him to serve as an assistant to the local prosecutor, who helped draw national media attention to the trial. In the half century after the Scopes Trial, fundamentalists had little success in shaping government policy, and they were generally defeated in their efforts to reshape the mainline denominations, which refused to join fundamentalist attacks on evolution. Particularly after the Scopes Trial, liberals saw a division between Christians in favor of the teaching of evolution, whom they viewed as educated and tolerant, and Christians against evolution, whom they viewed as narrow-minded, tribal, obscurantist.David Goetz, \\"The Monkey Trial\\". Christian History 1997 16(3): 10‚Äì18. 0891‚Äì9666; Burton W. Folsom, Jr. \\"The Scopes Trial Reconsidered.\\" Continuity 1988 (12): 103‚Äì127. 0277‚Äì1446, by a leading conservative scholar Edwards (2000), however, challenges the consensus view among scholars that in the wake of the Scopes trial, fundamentalism retreated into the political and cultural background, a viewpoint which is evidenced in the movie \\"Inherit the Wind\\" and the majority of contemporary historical accounts. Rather, he argues, the cause of fundamentalism's retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory rather than a defeat, but Bryan's death soon afterward created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader could fill. Unlike the other fundamentalist leaders, Bryan brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist religious groups to argue in favor of the anti-evolutionist position.Mark Edwards, \\"Rethinking the Failure of Fundamentalist Political Antievolutionism after 1925\\". Fides Et Historia 2000 32(2): 89‚Äì106. 0884‚Äì5379 Gatewood (1969) analyzes the transition from the anti-evolution crusade of the 1920s to the creation science movement of the 1960s. Despite some similarities between these two causes, the creation science movement represented a shift from religious to pseudoscientific objections to Darwin's theory. Creation science also differed in terms of popular leadership, rhetorical tone, and sectional focus. It lacked a prestigious leader like Bryan, utilized pseudoscientific argument rather than religious rhetoric, and was a product of California and Michigan rather than the South.Willard B. Gatewood, Jr., ed. Controversy in the Twenties: Fundamentalism, Modernism, & Evolution (1969) Webb (1991) traces the political and legal struggles between strict creationists and Darwinists to influence the extent to which evolution would be taught as science in Arizona and California schools. After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states. These included Reverends R. S. Beal and Aubrey L. Moore in Arizona and members of the Creation Research Society in California, all supported by distinguished laymen. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study, or at least relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than in other US areas and persisted through the Sputnik era. See also In recent times, the courts have heard cases on whether or not the Book of Genesis's creation account should be taught in science classrooms alongside evolution, most notably in the 2005 federal court case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District. Creationism was presented under the banner of intelligent design, with the book Of Pandas and People being its textbook. The trial ended with the judge deciding that teaching intelligent design in a science class was unconstitutional as it was a religious belief and not science.s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District et al., H. Conclusion The original fundamentalist movement divided along clearly defined lines within conservative evangelical Protestantism as issues progressed. Many groupings, large and small, were produced by this schism. Neo-evangelicalism, the Heritage movement, and Paleo-Orthodoxy have all developed distinct identities, but none of them acknowledge any more than an historical overlap with the fundamentalist movement, and the term is seldom used of them. The broader term \\"evangelical\\" includes fundamentalists as well as people with similar or identical religious beliefs who do not engage the outside challenge to the Bible as actively.Harris, Harriet A. Fundamentalism and Evangelicals (2008), pp. 39, 313.  Christian right  Jerry Falwell, whose founding of the Moral Majority was a key step in the formation of the \\"New Christian Right\\" The latter half of the twentieth century witnessed a surge of interest in organized political activism by U.S. fundamentalists. Dispensational fundamentalists viewed the 1948 establishment of the state of Israel as an important sign of the fulfillment of biblical prophecy, and support for Israel became the centerpiece of their approach to U.S. foreign policy.Aaron William Stone, Dispensationalism and United States foreign policy with Israel (2008) excerpt United States Supreme Court decisions also ignited fundamentalists' interest in organized politics, particularly Engel v. Vitale in 1962, which prohibited state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and Abington School District v. Schempp in 1963, which prohibited mandatory Bible reading in public schools.Bruce J. Dierenfield, The Battle over School Prayer (2007), page 236. By the time Ronald Reagan ran for the presidency in 1980, fundamentalist preachers, like the prohibitionist ministers of the early 20th century, were organizing their congregations to vote for supportive candidates.Oran Smith, The Rise of Baptist Republicanism (2000) Leaders of the newly political fundamentalism included Rob Grant and Jerry Falwell. Beginning with Grant's American Christian Cause in 1974, Christian Voice throughout the 1970s and Falwell's Moral Majority in the 1980s, the Christian Right began to have a major impact on American politics. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Christian Right was influencing elections and policy with groups such as the Family Research Council (founded 1981 by James Dobson) and the Christian Coalition (formed in 1989 by Pat Robertson) helping conservative politicians, especially Republicans to win state and national elections.Albert J. Menendez, Evangelicals at the Ballot Box (1996), pp. 128‚Äì74.  Christian fundamentalism in Australia  There are, in Australia, a few examples of the more extreme, American-style fundamentalist cult-like forms of Pentecostalism. The counter marginal trend, represented most notably by the infamous Logos Foundation led by Howard Carter in Toowoomba, Queensland, and later by \\"manifest glory\\" movements such as Bethel Church, Reddinghttps://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/may/cover-story-inside- popular-controversial-bethel-church.html title= Riches and Wagner (eds), Cover Story: Inside the Popular, Controversial Bethel Church. can be found in congregations such as the Range Christian Fellowship. The Logos Foundation, an influential and controversial Christian ministry, flourished in Australia in the 1970s and 1980s under the leadership of Howard Carter, originally a Baptist pastor from Auckland in New Zealand. Logos Foundation was initially a trans-denominational charismatic teaching ministry; its members were primarily Protestant but it also had some ties with Roman Catholic lay-groups and individuals.https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8027/HARRISON_eprint_.pdf Logos Foundation was Reconstructionist, Restorationist, and Dominionist in its theology and works. Paul Collins established the Logos Foundation in New Zealand as a trans-denominational teaching ministry which served the Charismatic Renewal by publishing the Logos Magazine. Paul Collins moved it to Sydney in Australia, where it also facilitated large trans-denominational renewal conferences in venues such as Sydney Town Hall and the Wentworth Hotel. It was transferred to Howard Carter's leadership, relocating to Hazelbrook in the lower Blue Mountains of New South Wales, where it operated for a few years, and in the mid-1970s, it was transferred to Blackheath in the upper Blue Mountains. During these years the teaching ministry attracted like- minded fellowships and home groups into a loose association with it. Publishing became a significant operation, distributing charismatic-themed and Restorationist teachings focused on Christian maturity and Christ's pre- eminence in short books and the monthly Logos/Restore Magazine (associated with New Wine Magazine in the United States). It held annual week-long conferences of over 1,000 registrants, featuring international charismatic speakers, including Derek Prince, Ern Baxter, Don Basham, Charles Simpson, Bob Mumford, Kevin Conner (Australia), Peter Morrow (New Zealand) and others. A Bible college was also established nearby at Westwood Lodge, Mount Victoria. At the main site in Blackheath a Christian K-12 school, Mountains Christian Academy was established which became a forerunner of more widespread Christian independent schools and home-schooling as a hallmark of the movement. It carried over the Old Covenant practice of tithing (to the local church), and expected regular sacrificial giving beyond this. Theologically the Logos Foundation taught orthodox Christian core beliefs ‚Äì however, in matters of opinion Logos teaching was presented as authoritative and alternative views were discouraged. Those who questioned this teaching eventually tended to leave the movement. Over time, a strong cult-like culture of group conformity developed and those who dared to question it were quickly brought into line by other members who gave automated responses which were shrouded in spiritualised expressions. In some instances the leadership enforced unquestioning compliance by engaging in bullying-type behavior. The group viewed itself as being separate from \\"the world\\" and it even regarded alternative views and other expressions, denominations or interpretations of Christianity with distrust at worst but considered most of them false at best. From the mid-1970s a hierarchical ecclesiology was adopted in the form of the Shepherding Movement's whole-of-life discipleship of members by personal pastors (usually their \\"cell group\\" leaders), who in turn were also accountable to their personal pastors. Followers were informed that even their leader, Howard Carter, related as a disciple to the apostolic group in Christian Growth Ministries of Bob Mumford, Charles Simpson, Ern Baxter, Derek Prince, and Don Basham, in Ft Lauderdale, US (whose network was estimated to have approx. 150,000 people involved at its peak ). Howard Carter's primary pastoral relationship was with Ern Baxter, a pioneer of the Healing Revival of the 1950s and of the Charismatic Renewal of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Written covenants of submission to the individual church pastors were encouraged for the members of one representative church, Christian Faith Centre (Sydney), and were said to be common practice throughout the movement at the time. In 1980 the Logos movement churches adopted the name \\"Australian Fellowship of Covenant Communities\\" (AFoCC), and were led through an eschatological shift in the early 1980s from the pre-millennialism of many Pentecostals (described as a theology of defeat), to the post-millennialism of the Presbyterian Reconstructionist theonomists (described as a theology of victory). A shift to an overt theological-political paradigm resulted in some senior leadership, including Pastor David Jackson of Christian Faith Centre Sydney, leaving the movement altogether. In the mid-1980s AFoCC re-branded yet again as the \\"Covenant Evangelical Church\\" (not associated with the Evangelical Covenant Church in the US). The Logos Foundation brand-name continued as the educational, commercial and political arm of the Covenant Evangelical Church. The group moved for the final time in 1986 to Toowoomba in Queensland where there were already associated fellowships and a demographic environment highly conducive to the growth of extreme right-wing religio-political movements. This fertile ground saw the movement peak in a short time, reaching a local support base of upwards of 2000 people.https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/file/cb4cc218-5145-a604-f5ec-180d9177971d/1/Hey_2011_02Thesis.pdf The move to Toowoomba involved much preparation, including members selling homes and other assets in New South Wales and the Logos Foundation acquiring many homes, businesses and commercial properties in Toowoomba and the Darling Downs. In the process of relocating the organisation and most of its members, he Covenant Evangelical Church absorbed a number of other small Christian churches in Toowoomba. Some of these were house churches/groups more or less affiliated with Carter's other organisations. Carter and some of his followers attempted to make links with Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen (in office 1968-1987), a known Christian conservative, in order to further their goals. Carter continued to lead the shift in eschatology to post-millennialism and prominently religio-political in nature. More of his leadership team left the movement as Carter's style became more authoritarian and cultish. Colin Shaw, who was a key member at this time, believed that Pastor Howard Carter was an \\"anointed man of God\\", and Shaw later became the \\"right-hand\\" man of Carter in his \\"outreach and missionary works\\" in Quezon City in the Philippines. Logos used a Filipino church, the Christian Renewal Center (a moderate Pentecostal/Charismatic church) as their base to advance and promote the teachings of the Shepherding Movement. With local assistance in the Philippines, Colin Shaw coordinated and sponsored (under the Christian Renewal Centre's name) conferences featuring Carter. Many poorly-educated and sincere Filipino pastors and locals, usually from small churches, were convinced to support the wider Logos movement with tithes that were collected from their limited funds. However, soon after the revelations of Howard Carter's scandalous immorality and corrupt lifestyle broke, the Filipino wing of Logos dissolved and its former members dispersed back into established local churches. Colin Shaw was said to have abandoned the Shepherding Movement at this time and for a time after that, he engaged in soul-searching and self- exile, fueled by severe guilt over the way the Filipino Christians were manipulated. In 1989 Logos controversially involved itself in the Queensland state election, running a campaign of surveys and full-page newspaper advertisements promoting the line that candidates' adherence to Christian principles and biblical ethics was more important than the widespread corruption in the Queensland government that had been revealed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry. Published advertisements in the Brisbane newspaper The Courier-Mail at the time promoted strongly conservative positions in opposition to pornography, homosexuality and abortion, and a return to the death penalty. Some supporters controversially advocated Old Testament laws and penalties.Sydney Morning Herald, 13 October 1990, \\"Sex Scandal ‚Äì Bible Belt\\", p.74 This action backfired sensationally, with many mainstream churches, community leaders and religious organisations distancing themselves from the Logos Foundation after making public statements denouncing it. At times the death penalty for homosexuals was advocated, in accordance with Old Testament Law.https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8027/HARRISON_eprint_.pdf, p.3\\"Sex Scandal ‚Äì Bible Belt\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 13 October 1990, p.74 The Sydney Morning Herald later described part of this campaign when the Logos Foundation campaigned: \\"Homosexuality and censorship should determine your vote, the electorate was told; corruption was not the major concern.\\"Roberts, G., \\"Sex Scandal Divides Bible Belt\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 12 October 1990. The same article quoted Carter from a letter he had written to supporters at the time, \\"The greenies, the gays and the greedy are marching. Now the Christians, the conservatives and the concerned must march also.\\" These views were not new. An earlier article published in the Herald quoted a Logos spokesman in reference to the call for the death penalty for homosexuals in order to rid Queensland of such people, who stated \\"the fact a law is on the statutes is the best safeguard for society\\".Lyons, J., \\"God Remains an Issue in Queensland\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 18 November 1989. Although similar behaviours had existed previously, these last years in Queensland saw Logos Foundation increasingly developing cult-like tendencies. This authoritarian environment degenerated into a perverse and unbiblical abuse of power. Obedience and unhealthy submission to human leaders was cultish in many ways and the concept of submission for the purpose of \\"spiritual covering\\" became a dominant theme in Logos Foundation teaching. The idea of spiritual covering soon degenerated into a system of overt abuse of power and excessive control of people's lives. This occurred despite growing opposition to the Shepherding movement from respected Evangelical and Pentecostal leaders in the United States, beginning as early as 1975. However, in Australia, through the Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church, this movement flourished beyond the time when it had effectively entered a period of decline in North America. Carter effectively quarantined followers in Australia from the truth of what had begun to play out in the U.S.A. The movement had ties to a number of other groups including World MAP (Ralph Mahoney), California; Christian Growth Ministries, Fort Lauderdale; and Rousas Rushdoony, the father of Christian Reconstructionism in the United States. Activities included printing, publishing, conferencing, home-schooling and ministry-training. Logos Foundation (Australia) and these other organizations at times issued theological qualifications and other apparently academic degrees, master's degrees and doctorates following no formal process of study or recognized rigour, often under a range of dubious names that included the word \\"University\\". In 1987 Carter conferred on himself a Master of Arts degree which was apparently issued by the Pacific College Theological, an institution whose existence investigating journalists have failed to verify. Carter frequently gifted such \\"qualifications\\" to visiting preachers from the United States - including a PhD purportedly issued by the University of Oceania Sancto Spiritus'. The recipient thereafter used the title of Doctor in his itinerant preaching and revival ministry throughout North America. The Shepherding Movement worldwide descended into a cultish movement characterized by manipulative relationships, abuse of power and dubious financial arrangements. It had been an attempt by mostly sincere people to free Christianity of the entrenched reductions of traditional and consumerist religion. However, with its emphasis on authority and submissive accountability, the movement was open to abuse. This, combined with spiritual hunger, an early measure of success and growth, mixed motives, and the inexperience of new leaders all coalesced to form a dangerous and volatile mix. Howard Carter played these factors skillfully to entrench his own position. The Logos Foundation and Covenant Evangelical Church did not long survive the scandal of Howard Carter's standing down and public exposure of adultery in 1990. Hey (2010) has stated in his thesis: \\"Suggested reasons for Carter's failure have included insecurity, an inability to open up to others, arrogance and over confidence in his own ability\\". As with many modern evangelists and mega-church leaders, followers within the movement placed him on a pedestal. This environment where the leader was not subject to true accountability allowed his deception and double life to flourish unknown for many years. In the years immediately prior to this scandal, those who dared to question were quickly derided by other members or even disciplined, thus reinforcing a very unhealthy environment. When the scandal of Carter's immorality was revealed, full details of the lavish lifestyle to which he had become accustomed were also exposed. Carter's frequent travel to North America was lavish and extravagant, utilizing first-class flights and five-star hotels. The full financial affairs of the organization prior to the collapse were highly secretive. Most members had been unaware of how vast sums of money involved in the whole operation were channelled, nor were they aware of how the leaders' access to these funds was managed. A significant number of quite senior ex-Logos members found acceptance in the now-defunct Rangeville Uniting Church. The congregation of the Rangeville Uniting Church left the Uniting Church to become an independent congregation known as the Rangeville Community Church. Prior to the Rangeville Uniting Church closing, an earlier split resulted in a significant percentage of the total congregation contributing to the formation of the Range Christian Fellowship in Blake Street in Toowoomba. The Range Christian Fellowship in Blake Street, Toowoomba, has a reputtion for exuberant worship services and the public manifestation of charismatic phenomena and manifestations that place it well outside of mainstream Pentecostal church expression. It is possibly one of the prime Australian examples of churches which are associated with the New Apostolic Reformation, a fundamentalist Pentecostal religious right wing movement which American journalist Forrest Wilder has described as follows: \\"Their beliefs can tend toward the bizarre. Some prophets even claim to have seen demons at public meetings. They've taken biblical literalism to an extreme\\". It operates in a converted squash-centre and was established on 9 November 1997 as a group which broke away from the Rangeville Uniting Church in Toowoomba over disagreements with the national leadership of the Uniting Church in Australia. These disagreements predominantly related to the ordination of homosexual people into ministry. The Range Christian Fellowship's diverse origins resulted in a divergent mix of worship preferences, expectations and issues. The church initially met in a Seventh-day Adventist Church hall before purchasing the property in Blake Street, leaving the congregation heavily indebted, often close to bankruptcy, and with a high turnover of congregants. The congregation attributes their continued avoidance of financial collapse to God's blessing and regards this as a miracle. Whilst adhering to Protestant beliefs, the church supplements these beliefs with influences from the New Apostolic Reformation, revivalism, Dominion theology, Kingdom Now theology, Spiritual Warfare Christianity and Five-fold ministry thinking. Scripture is interpreted literally, though selectively. Unusual manifestations attributed to the Holy Spirit or the presence of \\"the anointing\\" include women (and at times even men) moaning and retching as though experiencing child birth, with some claiming to be having actual contractions of the womb (known as \\"spiritual birthing\\").http://www.spiritwatch.org/fireimpart.htm, 4th paragraph Dramatic and apocalyptic predictions regarding the future were particularly evident during the time leading up to Y2K, when a number of prophecies were publicly shared, all of which were proven false by subsequent events. Attendees are given a high degree of freedom, influenced in the church's initial years by the promotion of Jim Rutz's publication, \\"The Open Church\\", resulting in broad tolerance of expressions of revelation, a \\"word from the Lord\\" or prophecy. At times, people within the fellowship claim to have seen visions - in dreams, whilst in a trance-like state during worship, or during moments of religious ecstasy - with these experiences frequently conveying a revelation or prophecy. Other occurrences have included people claiming to have been in an altered state of consciousness (referred to as \\"resting in the Lord\\" and \\"slain in the spirit\\" - among other names), characterized by reduced external awareness and expanded interior mental and spiritual awareness, often accompanied by visions and emotional (and sometimes physical) euphoria. The church has hosted visits from various Christian leaders who claim to be modern-day Apostles as well as from many others who claim to be prophets or faith healers. Perhaps surprisingly, speaking in tongues, which is common in other Pentecostal churches, also occurs but it is not frequent nor is it promoted; and it is rarely witnessed in public gatherings. Neo-charismatic elements are rejected elsewhere in classical Pentecostalism, such as the Prayer of Jabez, prosperity theology, the Toronto Blessing (with its emphasis on strange, non-verbal expressions), George Otis' Spiritual Warfare, the Brownsville Revival (Pensacola Outpouring), Morningstar Ministries, the Lakeland Revival, and the Vineyard group of churches, have been influential. The church has always been known for its vibrant and occasionally euphoric and ecstatic worship services, services featuring music, song, dancing, flags and banners. Range Christian Fellowship is part of the church unity movement in Toowoomba, with other like-minded churches (mainstream traditional denominations have a separate ecumenical group). This group, known as the Christian Leaders' Network, aspires to be a Christian right-wing influence group within the city, at the centre of a hoped-for great revival during which they will \\"take the city for the Lord\\". The Range Christian Fellowship has wholeheartedly thrown itself into citywide events that are viewed as a foundation for stimulating revival, which have included Easterfest, \\"Christmas the Full Story\\", and continuous 24-hour worship-events. The church retains an impressive resilience which it has inherited from its Uniting Church, which has seen it weather difficult times. Its beliefs and actions, which place it on the fringes of both mainstream and Pentecostal Christianity, are largely confined to its Sunday gatherings and gatherings which are privately held in the homes of its members. Criticism of the church is regarded as a badge of honour by some of its members, because they view it in terms of the expected persecution of the holy remnant of the true church in the last days. The church continues to be drawn to, and to associate itself with fringe Pentecostal and fundamentalist movements, particularly those which originated in North America, most recently with Doug Addison's. Addison has become known for delivering prophecies through dreams and unconventionally through people's body tattoos, and he mixes highly fundamentalist Christianity with elements of psychic spirituality.  Anglican fundamentalism   Catholic fundamentalism  Some scholars describe certain Catholics as fundamentalists. Such Catholics believe in a literal interpretation of doctrines and Vatican declarations, particularly those pronounced by the Pope, and they also believe that individuals who do not agree with the magisterium are condemned by God. Lutheran scholar Martin E. Marty claimed that any Catholic who advocates mass in Latin and mandatory clerical celibacy while opposing ordination of women priests and rejecting artificial birth control was a fundamentalist. This is considered a pejorative designation. The Society of St. Pius X, a product of Marcel Lefebvre, is cited as a stronghold of Catholic fundamentalism.  Criticism  Fundamentalists' literal interpretation of the Bible has been criticised by practitioners of Biblical criticism for failing to take into account the circumstances in which the Christian Bible was written. Critics claim that this \\"literal interpretation\\" is not in keeping with the message which the scripture intended to convey when it was written, and it also uses the Bible for political purposes by presenting God \\"more as a God of judgement and punishment than as a God of love and mercy\\". Christian fundamentalism has also been linked to child abuse and mental illness. Christian fundamentalism has also been linked to corporal punishment, with most practitioners believing that the Bible requires them to spank their children. Artists have addressed the issues of Christian Fundamentalism, with one providing a slogan \\"America's Premier Child Abuse Brand\\". Fundamentalists have attempted and continue to attempt to teach intelligent design, a hypothesis with creationism as its base, in lieu of evolution in public schools. This has resulted in legal challenges such as the federal case of Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District which resulted in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania ruling the teaching of intelligent design to be unconstitutional due to its religious roots. In the 1930s, fundamentalism was viewed by many as a \\"last gasp\\" vestige of something from the past but more recently, scholars have shifted away from that view. Confessional Lutheran churches reject the fundamentalist positionFor detailed coverage of the fundamentalist movement from a Confessional Lutheran perspective, see Engelder, T.E.W., Popular Symbolics.

He contributed significantly to the cause of urban reform in America at the turn of the twentieth century. He is known for using his photographic and journalistic talents to help the impoverished in New York City; those impoverished New Yorkers were the subject of most of his prolific writings and photography. He endorsed the implementation of \\"model tenements\\" in New York with the help of humanitarian Lawrence Veiller. Additionally, as one of the most famous proponents of the newly practicable casual photography, he is considered one of the fathers of photography due to his very early adoption of flash in photography. While living in New York, Riis experienced poverty and became a police reporter writing about the quality of life in the slums. He attempted to alleviate the bad living conditions of poor people by exposing their living conditions to the middle and upper classes. Biography =Early life= Born in Ribe, Denmark, Jacob Riis was the third of the 15 children (one of whom, an orphaned niece, was fostered) of Niels Edward Riis, a schoolteacher and writer for the local Ribe newspaper, and Carolina Riis (n√©e Bendsine Lundholm), a homemaker.Pascal, pp. 10‚Äì11; Ware, p. 2. Among the 15, only Jacob, one sister, and the foster sister survived into the twentieth century.Ware, p. 5. Riis was influenced by his father, whose school Riis delighted in disrupting. His father persuaded him to read (and improve his English via) Charles Dickens's magazine All the Year Round and the novels of James Fenimore Cooper.Pascal, p. 12. Jacob had a happy childhood but experienced tragedy at the age of eleven when his brother Theodore, a year younger, drowned. He never forgot his mother's grief.Ware, p. 9. At age eleven or twelve, he donated all the money he had and gave it to a poor Ribe family living in a squalid house if they cleaned it. The tenants took the money and obliged; when he told his mother, she went to help.Pascal, pp. 12‚Äì14; Ware, p. 9. Though his father had hoped that Jacob would have a literary career, Jacob wanted to be a carpenter.Ware, p. 9 Alland, p. 18. When he was 16, he became fond of Elisabeth Gj√∏rtz, the 12-year-old adopted daughter of the owner of the company for which he worked as an apprentice carpenter. The father disapproved of the boy's blundering attentions, and Riis was forced to travel to Copenhagen to complete his carpentry apprenticeship.Pascal, pp. 14‚Äì15. Riis returned to Ribe in 1868 at age 19. Discouraged by poor job availability in the region and Gj√∏rtz's disfavor of his marriage proposal, Riis decided to emigrate to the United States.Yochelson and Czitrom, pp. 3‚Äì4 =Migration to the United States= Riis immigrated to America in 1870, when he was 21 years old, seeking employment as a carpenter. He first traveled in a small boat from Copenhagen to Glasgow, where on May 18 he boarded the steamer Iowa, traveling in steerage. He carried $40 donated by friends (he had paid $50 for the passage himself); a gold locket with a strand of Elisabeth's hair, presented by her mother; and letters of introduction to the Danish Consul, Mr. Goodall (later president of the American Bank Note Company), a friend of the family since his rescue from a shipwreck at Ribe.Alland, p. 17; Ware pp. 14, 17‚Äì18. Riis disembarked in New York on June 5, on that day spending half of the $40 his friends had given him on a revolver for defense against human or animal predators.Alland, p. 19. When Riis arrived in New York City, he was one of a large number of migrants and immigrants, seeking prosperity in a more industrialized environment, who came to urban areas during the years after the American Civil War. Twenty-four million people relocated to urban areas, causing their population to increase eightfold. The demographics of American urban areas became significantly more heterogeneous as many immigrants arrived, creating ethnic enclaves often more populous than many of the cities of their homelands.James Davidson and Mark Lytle, \\"The Mirror with a Memory\\", After the Fact: The Art of Historical Detection 4th ed. (New York: McGraw Hill, 2000; ). \\"In the 1880s 334,000 people were crammed into a single square mile of the Lower East Side, making it the most densely populated place on earth. They were packed into filthy, disease-ridden tenements, 10 or 15 to a room, and the well-off knew nothing about them and cared less.\\"Robert Hughes, American Visions After five days, during which he used almost all his money, Riis found work as a carpenter at Brady's Bend Iron Works on the Allegheny River above Pittsburgh. After a few days of that, he began mining for increased pay but quickly resumed carpentry. Learning on July 19, 1870, that France had declared war on Germany, he expected that Denmark would join France to avenge the Prussian seizure of Schleswig, and determined to fight for France. He returned to New York, and, having pawned most of his possessions and without money, attempted to enlist at the French consulate, but was told that there was no plan to send a volunteer army from America. Pawning his revolver, he walked out of New York until he collapsed from exhaustion; on waking, he walked to Fordham College where a Catholic priest served him breakfast.Alland, p. 19; Ware, pp. 19‚Äì21. Ware says he went not to the consulate but instead found a reception for \\"a Frenchmen's Society\\", where he exhausted his hosts' patience and from which he was expelled. After a brief period of farm working and odd jobs at Mount Vernon, New York, Riis returned to New York, where he read in the newspaper New York Sun that the newspaper was recruiting soldiers for the war. Riis rushed there to enlist, but the editor (whom he later realized was Charles Anderson Dana) claimed or affected ignorance but offered the famished Riis a dollar for breakfast; Riis indignantly refused. Riis was destitute, at one time sleeping on a tombstone and surviving on windfall apples. Still, he found work at a brickyard at Little Washington in New Jersey, and was there for six weeks until he heard that a group of volunteers was going to the war. Thereupon he left for New York.Ware, pp. 21‚Äì23. On arrival, Riis found that the rumor was true but that he had arrived too late. He pleaded with the French consul, who expelled him. He made various other attempts to enlist, none successful.Ware, p. 23. As autumn began, Riis was destitute, without a job. He survived on scavenged food and handouts from Delmonico's Restaurant and slept in public areas or in a foul-smelling police lodging-house. At one time Riis's only companion was a stray dog. One morning he awoke in a lodging-house to find that his gold locket (with its strand of Elisabeth's hair) had been stolen. He complained to the sergeant, who became enraged and expelled him. Riis was devastated.Riis, The Making of an American (1904 ed.), pp. 72‚Äì74. The story became a favorite of Riis's.\\"Vice Which Is Unchecked\\", New York The Express Tribune (date unidentified, but the second half of this is reprinted in Alland, pp. 32‚Äì33); as an anecdote told to Theodore Roosevelt, see Alland, p. 32. One of his personal victories, he later confessed, was not using his eventual fame to ruin the career of the offending officer.Riis, The Making of an American (1904 ed.), pp. 231‚Äì33. Disgusted, he left New York, buying a passage on a ferry with the silk handkerchief that was his last possession. By doing odd jobs and stowing away on freight trains, Riis eventually reached Philadelphia, where he appealed to the Danish Consul, Ferdinand Myhlertz, for help and was cared for two weeks by the Consul and his wife.Ware, pp. 25‚Äì26. Myhlertz sent Riis, now dressed properly in a suit, to the home of an old classmate in Jamestown.Ware, p. 26. Riis worked as a carpenter in Scandinavian communities in the western part of the state, also working a variety of other jobs. He achieved sufficient financial stability to find the time to experiment as a writer, in both Danish and English, although his attempt to get a job at a Buffalo, New York newspaper was unsuccessful, and magazines rejected his submissions.Alland, p. 20; Ware, p. 26 Riis was in much demand as a carpenter, a major reason being the low prices he charged. However, his employers exploited his efficiency and low prices, and Riis returned to New York City.Ware, pp. 26‚Äì27 He was most successful as a salesman, particularly of flatirons and fluting irons, becoming promoted to the sales representative of them for Illinois. However, in Chicago he was cheated of both his money and his stock and had to return to an earlier base in Pittsburgh. There he found that his subordinates he had left to sell in Pennsylvania had cheated him in the same manner. He again had little money, and while bedridden with a fever learned from a letter that Elisabeth, the former object of his affection, was engaged to a cavalry officer. Riis then returned to New York by selling flatirons along the way.Alland, p. 21. =Early journalism= Riis noticed an advertisement by a Long Island newspaper for an editor, applied for and was appointed city editor. He quickly realized why the job had been available: the editor in chief was dishonest and indebted. Riis left in two weeks.Alland, p. 22. Again unemployed, Riis returned to the Five Points neighborhood. He was sitting outside the Cooper Union one day when the principal of the school where he had earlier learned telegraphy happened to notice him. He said that if Riis had nothing better to do, then the New York News Association was looking for a trainee. After one more night and a hurried wash in a horse trough, Riis went for an interview. Despite his disheveled appearance, he was sent for a test assignment: to observe and write about a luncheon at the Astor House. Riis covered the event competently and got the job.Alland, p. 23. Riis was able to write about both the rich and impoverished immigrant communities. He did his job well and was promoted to editor of a weekly newspaper, the News. However, this newspaper, the periodical of a political group, soon became bankrupt. Simultaneously, Riis got a letter from home which related that both his older brothers, an aunt, and Elisabeth Gj√∏rtz's fianc√© had died. Riis wrote to Elisabeth to propose, and with $75 of his savings and promissory notes, he bought the News company. Riis worked hard at his newspaper and soon paid his debts. Newly independent, he was able to target the politicians who had previously been his employers. Meanwhile, he received a provisional acceptance from Elisabeth, who asked him to come to Denmark for her, saying \\"We will strive together for all that is noble and good\\". Conveniently, the politicians offered to buy back the newspaper for five times the price Riis had paid; he was thus able to arrive in Denmark with a substantial amount of money.Alland, pp. 23‚Äì24; Elisabeth quoted in Riis, The Making of an American (1904 ed.), p. 442. After some months in Denmark, the newly married couple arrived in New York. Riis worked briefly as editor of a south Brooklyn newspaper, the Brooklyn News. To supplement his income, he used a \\"magic lantern\\" projector to advertise in Brooklyn, projecting either onto a sheet hung between two trees or onto a screen behind a window. The novelty was a success, and Riis and a friend relocated to upstate New York and Pennsylvania as itinerant advertisers. However, this enterprise ended when the pair became involved in an armed dispute between striking railroad workers and the police, after which Riis quickly returned to New York City.Alland, p. 24. =Years at the Tribune= A neighbor of Riis, who was the city editor of the New-York Tribune, recommended Riis for a short-term contract. Riis did well and was offered the job of police reporter. He was based in a press office across from police headquarters on Mulberry Street. \\"Nicknamed 'Death's Thoroughfare'\\", Riis's biographer Alexander Alland writes, \\"It was here, where the street crooks its elbow at the Five Points, that the streets and numerous alleys radiated in all directions, forming the foul core of the New York slums.\\"Alland, p. 25. During these stints as a police reporter, Riis worked the most crime-ridden and impoverished slums of the city. Through his own experiences in the poorhouses, and witnessing the conditions of the poor in the city slums, he decided to make a difference for them. Working night-shift duty in the immigrant communities of Manhattan's Lower East Side, Riis developed a tersely melodramatic writing style and he became one of the earliest reformist journalists. =Photography= Bandit's Roost (1888) by Jacob Riis, from How the Other Half Lives. This image is Bandit's Roost at 59¬Ω Mulberry Street, considered the most crime-ridden, dangerous part of New York City. Riis had for some time been wondering how to show the squalor of which he wrote more vividly than his words could express. He tried sketching, but was incompetent at this.Riis, The Making of an American (1904 ed.), pp. 266‚Äì67. Camera lenses of the 1880s were slow as was the emulsion of photographic plates; photography thus did not seem to be of any use for reporting about conditions of life in dark interiors. In early 1887, however, Riis was startled to read that \\"a way had been discovered to take pictures by flashlight. The darkest corner might be photographed that way.\\"Alland, p. 26; quotation from Riis, The Making of an American (1904 ed.), p. 267. The German innovation, by Adolf Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke, flash powder was a mixture of magnesium with potassium chlorate and some antimony sulfide for added stability;S. F. Spira, The History of Photography as Seen through the Spira Collection (New York: Aperture, 2001; ), p. 77. the powder was used in a pistol-like device that fired cartridges. This was the introduction of flash photography. Recognizing the potential of the flash, Riis informed a friend, Dr. John Nagle, chief of the Bureau of Vital Statistics in the City Health Department who was also a keen amateur photographer. Nagle found two more photographer friends, Henry Piffard and Richard Hoe Lawrence, and the four of them began to photograph the slums. Their first report was published in the New York newspaper The Sun on February 12, 1888; it was an unsigned article by Riis which described its author as \\"an energetic gentleman, who combines in his person, though not in practice, the two dignities of deacon in a Long Island church and a police reporter in New York\\". The \\"pictures of Gotham's crime and misery by night and day\\" are described as \\"a foundation for a lecture called 'The Other Half: How It Lives and Dies in New York.' to give at church and Sunday school exhibitions, and the like.\\" The article was illustrated by twelve line drawings based on the photographs.Alland, pp. 26‚Äì27; this reproduces the New York Sun article, \\"Flashes from the slums: Pictures taken in dark places by the lighting process: Some of the results of a journey through the city with an instantaneous camera‚ÄîThe poor, the idle and the vicious.\\" Riis and his photographers were among the first Americans to use flash photography.Chris Howes, \\"Flash Photography\\", Oxford Companion to the Photograph, ed. Robin Lenman (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005; ), pp. 224‚Äì25. Pistol lamps were dangerous and looked threatening,Riis, The Making of an American (1904 ed.), p. 268. and would soon be replaced by another method for which Riis lit magnesium powder on a frying pan. The process involved removing the lens cap, igniting the flash powder and replacing the lens cap; the time taken to ignite the flash powder sometimes allowed a visible image blurring created by the flash.Alland, pp. 27‚Äì28. Riis's first team soon tired of the late hours, and Riis had to find other help. Both his assistants were lazy and one was dishonest, selling plates for which Riis had paid. Riis sued him in court successfully. Nagle suggested that Riis should become self- sufficient, so in January 1888 Riis paid $25 for a 4√ó5 box camera, plate holders, a tripod and equipment for developing and printing. He took the equipment to the potter's field cemetery on Hart Island to practice, making two exposures. The result was seriously overexposed but successful.Alland, p. 27. For three years, Riis combined his own photographs with others commissioned of professionals, donations by amateurs and purchased lantern slides, all of which formed the basis for his photographic archive. Because of the nighttime work, he was able to photograph the worst elements of the New York slums, the dark streets, tenement apartments, and \\"stale-beer\\" dives, and documented the hardships faced by the poor and criminal, especially in the vicinity of notorious Mulberry Street.Riis, 2018 [1892]. pp. ix, 59, 64, 87, 208, 269‚Äì71 =Public speaking= Riis accumulated a supply of photography and attempted to submit illustrated essays to magazines. But when an editor at Harper's New Monthly Magazine said that he liked the photographs but not the writing, and would find another writer, Riis was despondent about magazine publication and instead thought of speaking directly to the public.Alland, p. 28. This was not easy. The obvious venue would be a church, but several churches‚Äîincluding Riis's own‚Äîdemurred, fearing either that the talks would offend the churchgoers' sensibilities or that they would offend rich and powerful landlords. However, Adolph Schauffler (of the City Mission Society) and Josiah Strong arranged to sponsor Riis's lecture at the Broadway Tabernacle church. Lacking money, Riis partnered with W. L. Craig, a Health Department clerk.Alland, p. 29. Riis and Craig's lectures, illustrated with lantern slides, made little money for the pair, but they both greatly increased the number of people exposed to what Riis had to say and also enabled him to meet people who had the power to effect change, notably Charles Henry Parkhurst and an editor of Scribner's Magazine, who invited him to submit an illustrated article. =Books= An eighteen-page article by Riis, How the Other Half Lives, appeared in the Christmas 1889 edition of Scribner's Magazine. It included nineteen of his photographs rendered as line drawings. Its publication brought an invitation to expand the material into an entire book. Riis, who favored Henry George's 'single tax' system and absorbed George's theories and analysis, used that opportunity to attack landlords \\"with Georgian fervor\\".Riis, Jacob A. \\"The Unemployed: a Problem\\". (In Peters, John P., Labor and Capital, a chapter on \\"Socialism and the Single Tax\\", pp. 425‚Äì31. New York, 1902. 12¬∞. Questions of the day, no. 98.) Riis had already been thinking of writing a book and began writing it during nights. (Days were for reporting for the New York Sun, evenings for public speaking.) How the Other Half Lives, subtitled \\"Studies Among the Tenements of New York\\", was published in 1890. The book reused the eighteen line drawings that had appeared in the Scribner's article and also seventeen reproductions using the halftone method,Alland, p. 30. and thus \\"[representing] the first extensive use of halftone photographic reproductions in a book\\".Martin Parr and Gerry Badger, The Photobook: A History vol. 1 (London: Phaidon, 2004; ), 53. (The magazine Sun and Shade had done the same for a year or so beginning 1888.) How the Other Half Lives sold well and was much quoted. Reviews were generally good, although some reviewers criticized it for oversimplifying and exaggerating. Riis attributed the success to a popular interest in social amelioration stimulated by William Booth's In Darkest England and the Way Out, and also to Ward McAllister's Society as I Have Found It, a portrait of the moneyed class.Alland, pp. 30‚Äì31 (although Alland misattributes In Darkest England to Charles Booth). The book encouraged imitations such as Darkness and Daylight; or, Lights and Shadows of New York Life (1892), which somehow appropriated Riis's own photographs.Alland, p. 31. Children of the Poor (1892) was a sequel in which Riis wrote of particular children that he had encountered. The Making of an American (1901), an autobiography, follows Riis's early life in Denmark and his struggles as an immigrant in the United States. The book also describes how Riis became a reporter and how his work in immigrant enclaves kindled his desire for social reforms. Riis organized his autobiography chronologically, but each chapter illustrates a broader theme that America is a land of opportunity for those who are bold enough to take chances on their future. The autobiography is mostly straightforward, but Riis is not sure if his past should be told as a \\"love story\\", \\"if I am, to tell the truth ... I don't see how it can be helped.\\" Although much of it is biographical, Riis also lays out his opinions about how immigrants like himself can succeed in the United States. Chapter 7 is distinct because Riis's wife, Elizabeth, describes her life in Denmark before she married Riis. Whereas How the Other Half Lives, and some of Riis's other books received praise from critics, he received a mixed reception for his autobiography. A New York Times reviewer dismissed it as a vanity project written for \\"close and intimate friends\\". He admired Riis's \\"dogged pluck\\" and \\"indomitable optimism\\", but dismissed an \\"almost colossal egotism‚Äîmade up of equal parts of vanity and conceit\\" as a major characteristic of the author. The reviewer anticipated the book would be \\"eagerly read by that large majority who have a craving and perennial interest in the personal and emotional incidents\\" within Riis's life. Riis anticipated such a critique, \\"I have never been able to satisfactorily explain the great run 'How The Other Half Lives' had ... like Topsy, it grew.\\" Other newspapers, such as the New York Tribune, published kinder reviews. Two years later, another reviewer reported that Riis's story was widely reprinted and dubbed him as one of the \\"best-known authors and ... one of the most popular lecturers in the United States.\\" The value of Riis's autobiography lies in the description of his origins as a social reformer. His early experiences in Ribe gave Riis a yardstick with which to measure tenement dwellers' quality of life. The account of the development of his powers of observation through his experiences as a poor immigrant lent authenticity to his news articles and larger works. Its themes of self-sufficiency, perseverance, and material success are prime examples of an archetype that successful Europeans like Riis used to demonstrate the exceptional opportunities that seem to exist only in the United States. In spite of its triumphalist outlook, The Making of an American remains useful as a source for students of immigration history and sociology who want to learn more about the author of How The Other Half Lives and the social reform movement that he helped to define. =Theodore Roosevelt= Riis walks the beat in New York City behind his friend and fellow reformer, NYC Police Commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt (1894 ‚Äì Illustration from Riis's autobiography) Theodore Roosevelt introduced himself to Riis, offering to help his efforts somehow. Upon his 1895 appointment to the presidency of the Board of Commissioners of the New York City Police Department, Roosevelt asked Riis to show him nighttime police work. During their first tour, the pair found that nine out of ten patrolmen were missing. Riis wrote about this for the next day's newspaper, and for the rest of Roosevelt's term the force was more attentive.Alland, p. 32. Roosevelt closed the police-managed lodging rooms in which Riis had suffered during his first years in New York. After reading the expos√©s, Roosevelt was so deeply affected by Riis's sense of justice that he befriended Riis for life, later remarking, \\"Jacob Riis, whom I am tempted to call the best American I ever knew, although he was already a young man when he came hither from Denmark\\".Theodore Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt: An Autobiography (BiblioBazaar, 2007; ), p. 66 (Here at Google Books); an earlier edition also at Project Gutenberg. After Roosevelt became president, he wrote a tribute to Riis that started: For his part, Riis wrote a campaign biography of Roosevelt that praised him.Alland, p. 34. =Public works= A particularly important effort by Riis was his exposure of the condition of New York's water supply. His five-column story \\"Some Things We Drink\\", in the August 21, 1891, edition of the New York Evening Sun, included six photographs (later lost). Riis wrote: The story resulted in the purchase by New York City of areas around the New Croton Reservoir, and may well have saved New Yorkers from an epidemic of cholera.Alland, p. 34, in which the passage by Riis (its own source unidentified) appears; Ware pp. 82‚Äì84. Riis tried hard to have the slums around Five Points demolished and replaced with a park. His writings resulted in the Drexel Committee investigation of unsafe tenements; this resulted in the Small Park Act of 1887. Riis was not invited to the eventual opening of the park on June 15, 1897, but went all the same, together with Lincoln Steffens. In the last speech, the street cleaning commissioner credited Riis for the park and led the public in giving him three cheers of \\"Hooray, Jacob Riis!\\" Other parks also were created, and Riis was popularly credited with them as well.Alland, p. 35 =Later life= Riis wrote his autobiography, The Making of an American, in 1901. His daughter, Clara C. Riis, married Dr. William Clarence Fiske.\\"A day's weddings\\" (PDF), The New York Times June 2, 1900. Retrieved August 17, 2009. His son, John Riis (1882‚Äì1946), served in Gifford Pinchot's new United States Forest Service from 1907 to 1913 as a ranger and forest supervisor on national forests in Utah, California and Oregon. He chronicled his time in the Forest Service in his 1937 book, Ranger Trails. Another son, Edward V. Riis, was appointed US Director of Public Information in Copenhagen toward the end of World War I; he spoke against antisemitism.\\"Danes welcome Riis: Glad he has come to represent our information bureau\\" (PDF), The New York Times September 21, 1918; \\"O'Malley puts punch in synagogue drive\\", Brooklyn Daily Eagle, December 9, 1919 (page scan, PDF). Both accessed August 17, 2009. A third son, Roger Williams Riis (1894‚Äì1953), was also a reporter and activist. In 1905, Jacob Riis's wife Elisabeth became ill and died. Riis remarried in 1907, and with his new wife, Mary Phillips, relocated to a farm in Barre, Massachusetts. Riis died at the farm on May 26, 1914. His second wife lived until 1967, continuing work on the farm, working on Wall Street and teaching classes at Columbia University.Francesca Pitaro, \\"Guide to the Jacob Riis Papers\\" (Manuscripts and Archives Division, New York Public Library, 1985; available as a PDF file here ). Riis's grave is marked by an unmarked granite boulder in Riverside Cemetery, in Barre, Massachusetts.Resting Places Social attitudes Sleeping homeless children, photographed by Riis. Riis's concern for the poor and destitute often caused people to assume he disliked the rich. However, Riis showed no sign of discomfort among the affluent, often asking them for their support. Although seldom involved with party politics, Riis was sufficiently disgusted by the corruption of Tammany Hall to change from being an endorser of the Democratic Party to endorse the Republican Party. The period just before the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was difficult for Riis. He was approached by liberals who suspected that protests of alleged Spanish mistreatment of the Cubans was merely a ruse intended to provide a pretext for US expansionism; perhaps to avoid offending his friend Roosevelt, Riis refused the offer of good payment to investigate this and made nationalist statements.Alland, p. 33. Riis emphatically supported the spread of wealth to lower classes through improved social programs and philanthropy, but his personal opinion of the natural causes for poor immigrants' situations tended to display the trappings of a racist ideology. Several chapters of How the Other Half Lives, for example, open with Riis' observations of the economic and social situations of different ethnic and racial groups via indictments of their perceived natural flaws; often prejudices that may well have been informed by scientific racism. Criticism Riis's sincerity for social reform has seldom been questioned, but critics have questioned his right to interfere with the lives and choices of others. His audience comprised middle-class reformers, and critics say that he had no love for the traditional lifestyles of the people he portrayed. Stange (1989) argues that Riis \\"recoiled from workers and working-class culture\\" and appealed primarily to the anxieties and fears of his middle-class audience.Maren Stange, \\"Jacob Riis and Urban Visual Culture\\", Journal of Urban History, May 1989, Vol. 15, Issue 3, pp. 274‚Äì303, quote on p. 278 Swienty (2008) says, \\"Riis was quite impatient with most of his fellow immigrants; he was quick to judge and condemn those who failed to assimilate, and he did not refrain from expressing his contempt.\\"Tom Swienty, The other half: the life of Jacob Riis and the world of immigrant (2008) p. 157 Gurock (1981) says Riis was insensitive to the needs and fears of East European Jewish immigrants who flooded into New York at this time.Jeffrey S. Gurock, \\"Jacob A. Riis: Christian Friend or Missionary Foe? Two Jewish Views\\", American Jewish History, Sept 1981, Vol. 71 Issue 1, pp. 29‚Äì47 Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell (2001) argues that immigrants during Riis's time were typically willing to live in cramped, unpleasant circumstances as a deliberate short-term strategy that allowed them to save more than half their earnings to help family members come to America, with every intention of relocating to more comfortable lodgings eventually. Many tenement renters physically resisted the well-intentioned relocation efforts of reformers like Riis, states Sowell, because other lodgings were too costly to allow for the high rate of savings possible in the tenements. Moreover, according to Sowell, Riis's own personal experiences were the rule rather than the exception during his era: like most immigrants and low-income persons, he lived in the tenements only temporarily before gradually earning more income and relocating to different lodgings.Thomas Sowell, The Quest for Cosmic Justice (Simon and Schuster, 2001), , pp. 128‚Äì29. Riis's depictions of various ethnic groups can be harsh.Stange, pp. 2‚Äì46. In Riis's books, according to some historians, \\"The Jews are nervous and inquisitive, the Orientals are sinister, the Italians are unsanitary.\\"Dowling, p. 111, quoting Ronald Sanders. Riis was also criticized for his depiction of African Americans. He was said to portray them as falsely happy with their lives in the \\"slums\\" of New York City. This criticism didn't come until much later after Riis had died. His writing was overlooked because his photography was so revolutionary in his early books.

He first appeared in the Carl Barks comic \\"Gladstone's Terrible Secret\\" (Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #140, May 1952), and was the regular lead character in 4-page backup stories in Barks' issues of Uncle Scrooge, starting with issue #13 (March 1956) and continuing through #41 (March 1963). Biography Gyro is Duckburg's most famous inventor, even though his inventions don't always work the way he wants them to. His outrageous productivity is presented as a factor in the quality of his inventions. Because Gyro is always coming up with new ideas, the fact that his inventions often lack an important feature will often cause trouble for both Scrooge and Donald, who are known to have frequently bought his inventions. He's known for being good-natured towards others. Gyro is often assisted by his Little Helper (or just \\"Helper\\"), who is a small anthropomorphic robot with a light bulb for a head. Besides Little Helper, he also has a \\"thinking cap\\", a hat shaped like a combination of a roof-top and a nest, with three black birds living inside it. Wearing this thinking cap helps Gyro figure out particularly difficult problems, but it only works if the birds are currently nesting in the cap. Some stories have involved the birds leaving Gyro's thinking cap, resulting in the cap becoming ineffective. Some of Gyro's relatives include his father Fulton Gearloose, his grandfather Ratchet Gearloose, and Newton Gearloose, his nephew. Occasionally there have been stories about Gyro's girlfriend Matilda. In some stories, Gyro's primary rival is Emil Eagle, although he is also antagonized by the Beagle Boys and Magica De Spell.Scrooge McDuck comic books With his inventions, he is also a very important ally of Donald Duck's alter ego, Paperinik, in the Italian Disney comics. Consistent with the two \\"G's\\" in his name, he had bins on his shelves containing odds and ends, which he labeled \\"Gewgaws\\", \\"Gimcracks\\", \\"Gadgets\\", and \\"Gizmos\\". Appearances in other media Gyro made his first animated appearance in a 1980s full-length movie, On the Sport Goofy Soccermania television special, with only one line of dialogue, voiced by Will Ryan: \\"Scrooge parting with a million dollars?\\" In the subsequent 1987 animated series DuckTales, Gyro became a regular character, with Hal Smith supplying his voice while Barry Gordon records it in several episodes. Among Gyro's noteworthy inventions in the series was the creation of the GizmoDuck suit, intended to be worn by a security guard for Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin. Although Gyro's shop and house are on the south side of Duckburg, he was born on the north side; a sign marks his birthplace and mentions one of his inventions: topless hats.Walt Disney \\"Golden Key\\" Comic Digest # 29 June 1971 In high school, young Gyro was a baseball pitcher with his \\"madball\\" pitch ‚Äî actually only a straight-ball pitch. When Gyro is forced to pitch for the Northside, pitting an \\"unhittable\\" baseball against another of his inventions, an \\"unmissable\\" baseball bat made for the Southside team, the result is total chaos. Gyro is a classic example of an eccentric genius. Once he persuaded the citizens of Duckburg to rebuild their metropolis into a climate-controlled \\"City of the Future\\". Unfortunately for Gyro, his idea worked too well. Donald Duck worked only 1 hour a day and spent 23 hours sleeping, which left him more grouchy than normal, while Uncle Scrooge's robot made him so much money that it filled up his money bin to the point where he couldn't even burrow into it. The final straw came when Gyro's Robot Helper makes a robot to replace Gyro as an inventor. Realizing Duckburg isn't ready for the future, Gyro returns the city back to its old self.Walt Disney \\"Golden Key\\" Comic Digest # 21 April 1970 Contrary to his entry in Don Markstein's Toonopedia, Gyro never appeared on House of Mouse. Gyro, in his usual role as an inventor, is replaced with Ludwig Von Drake in House of Mouse and many other cartoons. In the Toontown universe, Gyro created a robot that, when Scrooge accidentally wired it incorrectly, made the Cogs, the main antagonists of the game. They are grim businessmen-like robots who can't take a joke. So, to take care of the infestation, the Toons (the main protagonists of the game) destroy them with gags such as squirting seltzer water and throwing pies at them. A reimagined Gyro appears in the 2017 reboot of DuckTales (voiced by Jim Rash), in which he maintains a lab below Scrooge's Money Bin. This Gyro merges characteristics of his harsher, early comic book self with those of his original DuckTales counterpart along with adlibbing by Rash; the result being an eccentric who struggles with social graces and has a short temper, yet still retains a good nature and makes efforts to stop his inventions from harming people. He also has a track record of inventions gaining sentience and becoming evil, though he argues that some of them are merely misunderstood (a trait that the show creators have also attributed to Gyro himself). In his debut episode, \\"The Great Dime Chase!\\", he unveils Little Bulb (this show's version of Little Helper), who goes out of control under Louie's supervision (though Gyro manages to fix the problem by replacing his invention's head with a lower-watt bulb). He later begins brainstorming the creation of the Gizmoduck suit under the codename \\"Project Blatherskite\\". In season one's subsequent episodes, he took on Fenton Crackshell-Cabrera as an intern, clashed with Scrooge's rival Mark Beaks, and forced Donald Duck to swallow a voice modulator. In the season 2 premiere, he uses a modified shrink ray invention to communicate with a microscopic civilizations in the McDuck household, only to be taken hostage when he attempted to become their god-king. Later in season 2, his oxy-chew gum (used by Della and Donald Duck to survive on the moon), Time Teaser (used by Flintheart Glomgold in a scheme against Scrooge McDuck), and Time Tub (used by Gyro himself to travel back to the Old West and by Louie as part of a get- rich-quick scheme) make appearances. In the season 2 finale, he developed a clone spray that he used on himself and produced a small army of Little Bulbs with walkie-talkie functions. In season three, Gyro's past is explored further. Decades prior to the series, he worked as an optimistic young intern under roboticist, Dr. Akita. Gyro built a child-like defense drone named 2-BO and treated him like a real boy, but Akita tampered with his programming before using him to terrorize the city of Tokyolk. Having lost his creation, Gyro became embittered and repressed his memories of the android. When Huey brought 2-BO, now B.O.Y.D., to him to be fixed, Gyro was forced to return to Tokyolk and confront his past as well as Akita. Once he learned what happened and defeated his former mentor, Gyro reconciled with B.O.Y.D. Gearloose family members =Ratchet Gearloose= Ratchet Gearloose is Gyro's paternal grandfather, created by Carl Barks. He knew Scrooge McDuck: he first met him during his Mississippi riverboat days. They later met on the island of Krakatoa. Nothing was known about Ratchet since then but it is assumed that he wound up in Duckburg since his son Fulton Gearloose is one of the first three Junior Woodchucks. =Fulton Gearloose= Fulton Gearloose is the son of Ratchet Gearloose and the father of Gyro Gearloose. Created by Don Rosa, he was first mentioned in Guardians of The Library in Uncle Scrooge Adventures #27\\"Uncle Scrooge Adventures\\" #27 (July 1994) as the inventor of The Junior Woodchucks Merit Badge, as well as the first person it was awarded to (for inventing it). He first appeared in person in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Part 10 as a young child and one of the first three Junior Woodchucks. He appears as an elderly man in the story Gyro's First Invention. =Newton Gearloose= Newton Gearloose is Gyro's nephew. He first appeared in 1960 in the Gyro Gearloose story titled 'Ting-A-Ling Trouble', written by Vic Lockman and drawn by Phil DeLara, in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #308. Newton was a fan of his uncle's work and wanted to be an inventor like him when he grew up. Newton is also a Junior Woodchuck, as well as a friend of Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Newton went by the nickname \\"Giggy\\". After the early 1970s, Newton ceased appearing in new North American Disney comics. He continued to be used in some Brazilian and Danish-produced Disney comics into the 1990s, while he still appears in Dutch and Italian-produced comics. There was a similar character in the DuckTales episode \\"Superdoo\\". Like Newton, he was also in the Junior Woodchucks. Though his name is never spoken, he does bear a physical resemblance to Newton Gearloose.

An Italian sorceress, she constantly attempts to steal Scrooge McDuck's Number One Dime, which she believes will play a vital role in magically obtaining the same fabulous wealth of its owner. Publication history De Spell first appeared in \\"The Midas Touch\\", first published in December, 1961. According to Barks, he intended to create her as another recurring antagonist for Scrooge in addition to the Beagle Boys and Flintheart Glomgold. But in contrast to Witch Hazel from Trick or Treat ‚Äî first released on October 10, 1952 ‚Äî or Mad Madam Mim, she would not be in the image of the ugly old hag usually associated with witches. Barks instead decided to create a witch who was young and beautiful, so he took inspiration for her look from Italian actresses Gina LollobrigidaBlum, Geoffrey.\\"The Meaning of Magica\\", Uncle Scrooge Adventures in Color, no.39, February 3, 1998 and Sophia Loren. He also wanted her to be seductive, amoral, and somewhat threatening. In a later interview, Barks identified a similar figure from the comic strips of Charles Addams as another source of inspiration for Magica, namely Morticia Addams of The Addams Family. All in all, Barks drew nine stories with Magica: The Midas Touch in 1961; Ten- Cent Valentine, The Unsafe Safe, and Raven Mad in 1962; Oddball Odyssey, For Old Dime's Sake, and Isle of Golden Geese in 1963; The Many Faces of Magica de Spell and Rug Riders in the Sky in 1964. In the latter, Barks tried to increase the usability of the character by having plots turn on other magic artifacts, here a flying carpet, not always having to repeat the joke about Scrooge's first coin. Magica also appeared as an antagonist in the Wizards of Mickey comic series as part of a trio of sorceresses who all had rivalries with each other. Character biography According to Barks and his successors, Magica lives on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, next to Naples, Italy. Her primary motivation is to steal Scrooge's Number One Dime and melt it in the fires of the volcano, so she can turn it into a powerful magical amulet capable of granting the Midas Touch. While she has worked with criminals such as the Beagle Boys to get Scrooge's Dime, Magica typically works with individuals such as a raven named Ratface in the comics and apprentices like Samson Hex, a bungling no-hoper. Magica's family members have also appeared in the comics, such as her grandmother Granny De Spell, who has been no more successful in obtaining the Number One Dime despite claiming to be one of the most powerful witches; her sister the Wicked Witch of the West; the Wicked Witch's mischievous daughter and son Witch Child and Warlock, who Magica is sometimes tasked with babysitting; another niece called Minima De Spell; and a cousin named Witch Matilda, who has served under Magica as an apprentice. Another character connected to Magica is Rosolio, a dim-witted goose who claims to be her fianc√© despite always being rejected. He is supported in this by a grandmother of Magica's (separate from Granny De Spell) created in the Italian comics called Caraldina (original Italian name). Magica has an odd relationship with Scrooge to the point of sometimes manifesting itself as mutual attraction. For example, in the 1987 DuckTales episode \\"Till Nephews Do we Part\\", she and Poe are invited to and attend Scrooge's wedding. However, she has maintained an antagonist relationship with him and his family, such as Donald Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Gyro Gearloose, Gladstone Gander, as well as Daisy Duck and her nieces. =DuckTales= Magica was also a recurring on the animated television show DuckTales, where she was voiced by June Foray (using a similar Eastern European accent to that of Natasha Fatale from Rocky & Bullwinkle; in the Italian version, Magica's voice actress, Sonia Scotti, depicted her with a heavy Neapolitan accent). Magica appears mostly in first-season episodes of the show. Her only appearance in the second season is in the episode \\"The Unbreakable Bin\\". Although she appears as one of the series' major villains, she is frequently a source of comic relief. In Magica's final scene in the series for example, she attempts to send Scrooge's \\"tin man back to Oz\\", but is herself sent elsewhere in a whirlwind when a Quackenyeeken Yeeker bird in fear, causing her jar of magic dust to break open and carry her away. On more than one occasion, her plan to obtain Scrooge's dime backfires so spectacularly that she is forced to work with Scrooge to prevent a greater disaster. According to the show, her brother is Poe De Spell, who was transformed into a raven and serves as her magical familiar ‚Äì in reference to Edgar Allan Poe's poem \\"The Raven\\"; replacing Ratface from the comics. A similar reference had already been established in the German versions of Magica comics, where her raven is called \\"Nimmermehr\\" (\\"Nevermore\\"), referring to the recurring keyword from Poe's poem. In the reboot, Magica speaks with an English accent as she is voiced by Catherine Tate, former Doctor Who costar to David Tennant (who voices Scrooge McDuck in the new series). Within the reboot's storyline, Magica has a history with Clan McDuck and a vendetta against Scrooge after he sealed her physical body within his Number One Dime during a climactic battle atop Mount Vesuvius 15 years prior to the start of the series. Throughout the first season, Magica manifested as a shadowy specter and forced her niece Lena De Spell (who is later revealed to be a familiar she created) to gain the Duck family's trust in order to acquire Scrooge's Dime and regain her body. While Magica eventually regained her corporeal form during an eclipse that occurred in the season one finale before proceeding to decimate Duckburg, she is defeated and forced to flee after being stripped of her powers by the combined efforts of Scrooge and his family destroying her staff. In the second season episode, \\"A Nightmare on Killmotor Hill!\\", Magica uses a telepathic helmet to invade Lena's dreams and get her powers back from her, though she is foiled once more and Lena destroys her helmet. In a later episode, \\"GlomTales!\\", she joins an alliance of Scrooge's greatest enemies led by Flintheart Glomgold in a joint effort to destroy Scrooge and his family. However, Glomgold ends up losing his fortune (as well as that of the other villains') to Louie Duck, causing the villains to turn on the former second richest duck in the world. In season three, Magica regained her powers while helping Lena and her friends fend off the Phantom Blot, whose village Magica destroyed in the past, but she was in turn fended off by Lena, who had mastered her own powers during the fight. =Darkwing Duck= Magica makes a cameo appearance in the Darkwing Duck episode \\"In Like Blunt\\" along with the Beagle Boys and Flintheart Glomgold, among the bidders for the secret S.H.U.S.H. agent list. She had a proper role in the Darkwing Duck comic published by Boom! Studios, teaming up with Negaduck (whom she had saved from the Crimebots from \\"The Duck Knight Returns\\") in the story \\"Crisis on Infinite Darkwings\\". By combining their powers and knowledge, they intended to unleash an army of brainwashed, alternate universe Darkwing Ducks on St. Canard, as it would be of benefit to both their agendas ‚Äì her hope is to force Darkwing's ally Launchpad McQuack to lead her to Scrooge's Number One Dime. Magica and Negaduck had contempt for each other, which they kept hidden behind a 'friendly' facade; early on, Negaduck sarcastically refers to his desire for a city and hers for \\"...one dime\\" as being \\"similar ambitions\\". Darkwing's girlfriend Morgana McCawber, herself a witch, would assist the hero and battle Magica in magical combat. She swiftly drained Morgana's magic using a source absorber, doubling her power, but lost it thanks to the intervention of an alternate Darkwing. This ended her control over the alternate reality Darkwings and ended Negaduck's plan, and after the arrival of the monstrous demon Paddywhack, Magica fled the city. She returned for the final arc of the series, a crossover with the DuckTales comic also published by Boom!, where she teamed up with other female Disney villains and exploited black \\"slime\\" that could turn normal people evil and villains into stronger forms. She used it to bring in an army of villains from Duckburg and St. Canard, as well as a brainwashed Phantom Blot, and tried to seize both cities so she could have all of Scrooge McDuck's assets. To her dismay, the slime turned out to be a transformed Negaduck, who seized control of the plan before all the villains were banished to another dimension. This last arc was later rendered to be non-canonical, and not included in the omnibus collecting the series. Video games Magica appears in the DuckTales video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System as the boss of the Transylvania stage, where she attacks Scrooge with lightning bolts and by transforming into a giant bird. In the remake DuckTales Remastered, Magica uses an expanded set of attacks (such as launching energy beams at Scrooge and summoning mirrors to hide in) and also plays a larger role in the game's overall storyline. Just like in the cartoon, she is voiced by June Foray. Other video game appearances by Magica include Donald Duck: The Lucky Dime Caper, in which she kidnaps Donald's nephews and steals Scrooge's lucky dime, and in the 2000 video game Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers as the boss of a flying mansion. Magica also appears as the second secret playable character in the 2008 trivia video game Disney TH!NK Fast. Attributes =Powers and abilities= Magica De Spell is a very powerful witch with magical powers that include the ability to teleport over long distances, flight, the power to conjure and transmute matter, and the ability to turn herself into any animal she wants. Her actual capability to wield magic varies from writer to writer. Carl Barks' incarnation is quite powerful, with her naivete being her only prominent weakness. Don Rosa's incarnation of Magica De Spell is, however, far more limited as she usually only uses magic through magical objects and in The Quest for Kalevala, Magica acknowledges she can't use magic without a wand. =Beliefs= Unlike other people who think the Number One Dime to be a lucky charm, Magica doesn't believe it to be the source of Scrooge's wealth, but Scrooge's wealth to be the source of the dime's powers, as she only tries to steal it because it's the first coin ever earned by the richest duck (or man) on Earth. It can be noticed when she steals the dime but gives it back when she realized she somehow caused the dime to lose such status. Examples of such stories are \\"Of Ducks and Dimes and Destinies\\", when she travels in time to steal the dime in the very same day Scrooge earns it and gives it back after realizing that by preventing Scrooge from owning the dime, she would turn it into a coin that never belonged to him, or \\"A Little Something Special\\", when she teams up with Flintheart Glomgold and the Beagle Boys in a plan made by Blackheart Beagle. She gives the dime back after realizing Scrooge wouldn't be the richest man on Earth after the Beagle Boys steal his money. In Carl Barks's \\"Ten-Cent Valentine\\", it's revealed she believes the dime must stay in one piece until she finally melts it or the spell won't work. Huey, Dewey, and Louie trick Magica into thinking it was destroyed by a meat grinder. Magica believes she is the disciple of the ancient sorceress Circe. Family A lot of Magica's relatives appear in Italian stories. * Granny De Spell, Magica's grandmother * Rosolio, Magica's cousin * Minima De Spell, her niece * Matilda, Magica's teenager cousin * Adelia, Magica's fairy cousin =DuckTales familiars= The 1987 DuckTales series introduces Magica's brother Poe (voiced Frank Welker), who was transformed into a non-anthropomorphic raven while maintaining his ability to speak. Although Magica has various transformation spells at her disposal, she is unable to turn Poe back into an anthropomorphic duck. In Poe's debut episode, \\"Send in the Clones\\", Magica explains that she needs the power of Scrooge's Number One Dime to restore Poe. His name is a reference to Edgar Allan Poe, and Poe often ends his stanzas with the word \\"nevermore\\", quoting the poem \\"The Raven\\". Following \\"Send in the Clones\\", Poe reappeared in \\"Magica's Shadow War\\" and \\"Raiders of the Lost Harp\\". Outside these three DuckTales episodes, Poe's only other appearances are in DuckTales comic book stories. Poe is not to be confused with Ratface, Magica's pet raven from the Uncle Scrooge comic books. In \\"Magica's Magic Mirror\\" she mentions her great grandma Tragica. The 2017 DuckTales reboot has yet to mention Poe, but it does introduce Magica's \\"niece\\" Lena (voiced by Kimiko Glenn) ‚Äì who is eventually revealed to be a magically created shadow creature and Magica's spy. Even though Lena refers to Magica as her \\"Aunt\\", the sorceress is technically more comparable to her mother in the creator/creation sense. During the series' first season, Lena meets Webby Vanderquack in order to gain access to Scrooge's Number One Dime so Magica can regain her corporeal form, but Lena slowly befriends her and later sacrifices herself to save her from Magica. During the second season, Webby manages to restore Lena, allowing her to exist independently of Magica. She is also revealed to have access to Magica's powers, which initially scared her due to the possibility of becoming her. With the help of her friends though, she is able to overcome that fear and use her powers for good.

He is a South African Pekin Duck and the archenemy of Scrooge McDuck, usually portrayed as an ambitious, ruthless, and manipulative businessman who shares many of the same qualities as Scrooge‚Äîthe drive for massive wealth, and the cunning and creativity to obtain the same‚Äîbut he lacks any of Scrooge's tendencies towards generosity and compassion. In Don Rosa's The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, he is said to be a Boer. Glomgold is one of Scrooge's main rivals along with the Beagle Boys, Magica De Spell, and John D. Rockerduck, and also holds the title of being the \\"Second Richest Duck in the World\\" while Scrooge is the richest. His appearance is deliberately similar to that of Scrooge, but he is usually drawn with a full beard and sideburns as opposed to simple side-whiskers, black or purple frock coat instead of Scrooge's red or blue one, and a dark tam o'shanter instead of Scrooge's top hat. Comic history =Under Carl Barks= Glomgold was originally created in 1956 by Scrooge McDuck artist and creator Carl Barks, the creator of much of the Duck universe. Characterized as an unrepentant miser, tycoon, plutocrat, and general villain, he rarely sees any problem with breaking the law, cheating, or using other unfair tactics in order to fulfill his goal of becoming the world's richest duck. That makes him a \\"broken mirror\\" of Scrooge McDuck, whose own avarice is usually tempered with kindness or charity. Flintheart Glomgold from Carl Barks' story \\"The Second-Richest Duck\\". Glomgold first appeared in The Second-Richest Duck, first published in September 1956. In this story, Scrooge, who holds the title of the Richest Duck in the World, learns that a businessman from the valley of the Limpopo, South Africa has also claimed this title. Scrooge decides to confront this claimant to his title and travels to South Africa along with his nephew Donald and three grandnephews. The rest of the story concentrates on comparing and contrasting the two rivals during a race through \\"The Heart of Africa\\" (a recurring phrase in the story), by seeing who has the largest ball of string, because they are shown equal in everything else, from cash to gold mines to even who has the most pumpkins. The race is supposed to determine which one of them deserves the title. The two characters resemble each other both in appearance and behavior though their main common point seems to be that they are extremely competitive, and neither of them can accept the idea of someone else being equal or superior to them. Flintheart, like Scrooge, keeps a percentage of his fortune in his own Money Bin, identical to that of Scrooge (with the exception of the external logo: a dollar sign on McDuck's and a pound sign on Glomgold's), while the rest of his fortune is invested in a worldwide financial empire of his own that equals that of Scrooge, although Scrooge's main sources of wealth are his industries, while Flintheart's are his diamond mines. However, the main difference between them seems to be their way of life. Scrooge's Money Bin is at the center of Duckburg, Calisota, United States, a constantly expanding industrial city, while Flintheart's is in the center of a valley, located somewhere in the lands around Limpopo, surrounded by wildlife and away from human activities. While Scrooge finds himself surrounded by an extended family (see Clan McDuck, Duck family, and Coot Kin) and a large number of allies and rivals (see Scrooge McDuck Universe), Flintheart lives a life of solitude and seems to have no family, friends, or for that matter rivals except Scrooge himself. While Scrooge has his nephews helping him or advising him, Flintheart faces every situation alone. This appears to have hardened him ‚Äì he is considerably more ruthless than Scrooge ‚Äì but also leaves him vulnerable to being simply outnumbered by his rivals. Even at the end of the story, when Scrooge has won and Flintheart passes out after finding he is only second best, he has to be carried home by Huey, Dewey, and Louie because he has no one else to help him. The solitary South African re- appeared to challenge Scrooge to a rematch in The Money Champ, first published in September 1959. This time the confrontation takes place in Scrooge's grounds in Duckburg with the city's population witnessing the event, and they only count their wealth in cash and not their investments, so they have to liquidate much of their fortunes. Flintheart uses a number of underhand plots against Scrooge, but his plans backfire when their cost in money also costs Flintheart his chance at victory. The story adds little to what was established in the previous one. However, for the first time, some panels concentrate on Flintheart's thoughts, revealing that his insecurities about his own worth are the driving force behind both his efforts to best Scrooge and his dishonest tactics (since he doubts his ability to win in a direct confrontation), and that Flintheart believes said tactics are betrayals of his \\"dear old mother's fondest hopes\\". Barks would use Flintheart for a third and last time in So Far and no Safari, first published in January 1966. This was one of the last stories Barks created before his retirement. The themes of the story are considerably darker than the two previous ones. Flintheart's intentions towards Scrooge are clearly depicted as murderous. The story starts with Scrooge planning to participate in an auction for an old South African gold mine. It's considered exhausted, but Scrooge's mechanics believe that the main vein of gold hasn't even been reached. While Scrooge is piloting his private plane over South Africa, with Donald, Huey, Dewey, and Louie as passengers, Flintheart appears piloting his own plane. It is equipped with machine guns, with which he shoots down Scrooge. While Scrooge is still trying to reach the auction, Flintheart repeatedly tries to get rid of him. When Scrooge manages to reach the Kalahari Desert, Flintheart's plane is revealed to be a bomber as well. Flintheart bombards Scrooge and his nephews, but misses. When he returns for a second bombing run, the Ducks have dressed some rocks with their clothing and have taken cover elsewhere. Flintheart mistakes the rocks for his targets and destroys them, noting that his rivals are now dinner for the jackals. His victory is short-lived, however. Because he was flying low, the bomb explosions damaged his plane's fuel tank. He crash-lands the plane and finds himself in no better condition than Scrooge. The rest of the story presents Scrooge's and Flintheart's rival efforts to cross the Kalahari and reach the auction. The end of the story finds them at the auction, tired from their difficult treks, but still rivaling each other, while an exhausted Donald has fallen asleep. It is considered Flintheart's darkest appearance and among his strongest and most memorable ones. =After Barks= During the ten years that followed his creator's retirement the character made infrequent appearances, appearing only in four comic book stories. He wasn't nearly as recognizable as other rivals of Scrooge, like Italian sorceress Magica DeSpell, who appeared far more often. Flintheart returned to prominence in 1979, when Egmont editors Lars Bergstr√∂m and Stefan Printz-P√•hlson decided to revive the character. Since then, Flintheart Glomgold has appeared in more than 100 Egmont stories, some of which depict him as an influential member of Duckburg's Billionaires Club (which also includes Scrooge and John D. Rockerduck). Flintheart Glomgold and his nephew Slackjaw Snorehead. In Werner Wejp-Olsen and Daniel Branca's 1981 comic book story \\"The Top Treasure in Town\\", Flintheart's grandfather, Stoneheart Glomgold, who in 1870 worked as a hansom cab driver in London, is introduced. In John Lustig and Vicar's comic book story \\"Family of Fore\\" (2001) it was stated that both he and Scrooge are distantly related to by then deceased Scottish golf enthusiast Bogey McDivot. McDivot has only been mentioned in that story. In Lars Jensen and Vicar's 2002 comic book story \\"Happy Birthday, Flintheart Glomgold\\", Glomgold's nephew, Slackjaw Snorehead, is introduced. Slackjaw is a genial slacker; very friendly and cheerful as well as a genius with a talent for business. He does however prefer to hang around with his friends to do nothing all day rather than use his intellect productively, which is very infuriating to Glomgold. In the English translation, Slackjaw at times uses South African slang (e.g. howzit or brasse). In Lars Jensen and Marco Rota's 2005 story \\"The Glomgold Heritage\\", Flintheart's father, Brickheart Glomgold, and mother appeared briefly. It's also revealed in this story that Flintheart's grandfather, Stoneheart, was a Scotsman who moved to London and later on, together with his son Brickheart, traveled to South Africa after being wrongly accused for theft. From this experience, the Glomgolds learned that the world was unfair and cruel, and that they had to look out for themselves even if that meant acting outside the law. In the 1988 DuckTales comic book story \\"The Smart Nephew\\" by Bob Gregory, Cosme Quartieri, and Jorge Sanchez, another nephew of Glomgold appears: the smart and brave Junior. =Under Don Rosa= In 1987 Keno Don Rosa created his first Scrooge McDuck story, \\"The Son of the Sun\\", first published in July 1987. Rosa's detailed style of drawing, references to Barks stories (by then considered classic) like \\"Lost in the Andes!\\", detailed references to often obscure historical figures and events and strong characterization would later make Rosa fans consider him one of Barks' most popular \\"successors\\". Those themes are all evident in his first story. It begins with Flintheart questioning Scrooge's many successes as a treasure-hunter. He claims that discovering riches that are already concentrated by others is not that hard and that he could do it better than Scrooge if he decided to try. Soon, he is following Scrooge and his nephews in their latest treasure hunt, locating a hidden temple of Manco C√°pac, who was the legendary founder of the Inca dynasty. The temple is hidden somewhere in the tops of the Andes and, according to inscriptions earlier found by Scrooge, supposed to contain a great treasure. In the course of the story Flintheart is shown to be one of Scrooge's most charismatic, resourceful, and ruthless rivals. Rosa, who admits to have a soft spot for the character, has used Flintheart in a growing number of stories and has offered him a sort of origin. In his stories, Flintheart is a Boer from the province of Transvaal. He was born around the same time as Scrooge and first met him during the Witwatersrand Gold Rush in 1886, a key event leading to the founding of Johannesburg. Like Scrooge, Flintheart was born in poverty and was working his way up the financial ladder. While unsuccessfully searching for diamonds, he attempted to steal the findings of more successful fellow miners. As a result, he was tied to the horns of a water buffalo and the animal was then sent running. Flintheart was found and saved by Scrooge. Flintheart offered to be the guide of the recently arrived gold miner from Scotland, since he knew the territory. Scrooge accepted him as a needed companion and friend. But at night while Scrooge was sleeping, Flintheart stole his ox-cart along with all his equipment and supplies and left him alone in the wilderness. Having underestimated Scrooge, he was surprised when Scrooge caught up to him, furious and vengeful. When Scrooge finished with him, Flintheart was publicly humiliated, thoroughly embittered, and imprisoned for theft. The two rivals made vows to themselves that helped shape some of their character traits. Scrooge vowed to never trust anybody ever again, in order not to be betrayed again. Apparently this is the source of Scrooge's distrust towards others whether they are allies, rivals, or complete strangers and the reason he is secretive about his thoughts and emotions. On the other hand, a completely defeated Flintheart vowed that he will work to become so rich that nobody can humiliate him again (see Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck ‚Äì Part VI: The Terror of the Transvaal). Because Scrooge officially meets Glomgold for the first time during \\"The Second Richest Duck\\" in 1956, Don Rosa makes sure Glomgold's name is never mentioned in his tale. Since Glomgold gets Scrooge's name, some fans could think he's more interested in defeating and humiliating Scrooge as revenge for getting imprisoned rather than becoming the world's richest duck. According to Rosa's unofficial timelines, it would take him twenty years of hard work as a diamond miner till finally he became rich in 1906 by his profits. He would spend the next fifty years working his way up the financial ladder both by hard efforts and dishonest methods when needed. Don Rosa also revealed in at least two stories another thing that makes Flintheart a counterpart to Scrooge: the Number One Rand, the first coin Flintheart Glomgold ever earned (or stole). In Return to Plain Awful, this rand makes his first appearance, a cameo, and has nothing to do with the story, alongside a framed pound note labelled as Glomgold's \\"No. 1 Pound\\" and a diamond under a glass dome labelled as \\"My First Diamond\\". In A Little Something Special, the Rand makes an equally small but more relevant role. Magica De Spell teamed up with him and the Beagle Boys to get the Number One Dime. Scrooge reminds Magica he will no longer be the richest duck in the world after they steal his fortune, and the Dime will be worthless to her. Based on the advice Scrooge gives her in exchange for his dime back, Magica steals Flintheart's first rand. To make things worse for Glomgold, Magica takes the Beagle Boys with her to the Valley of Limpopo, where they carry all they can of Flintheart's cash. Despite the fact he teamed up with them in that story against Scrooge, he still dares to ask what did he do to deserve that. Notable is the fact that Flintheart Glomgold's first coin could not be a rand, because the South African Rand did not come into existence until 1961. Before a unified South Africa in 1910 (whereupon the South African pound was introduced), many authorities in the region issued coins and banknotes in their own currencies, often equivalent to the Pound Sterling of the Cape of Good Hope colony that had existed since 1825. Adding it to the fact that Don Rosa's stories usually take place in the 1950s, this meant it would be impossible for anyone to own a rand in such stories. Animation and other appearances Flintheart Glomgold as he appeared in DuckTales An animated version of the character appeared in the TV series DuckTales, which started airing on September 18, 1987. The Second Richest Duck was among the series' most prominent characters, and this helped his introduction to a wider audience. But some drastic changes came to the character. His Scottish ancestry was emphasised over his adopted South African nationality, which is never mentioned. He was depicted as wearing a traditional Scottish kilt. His voice actor Hal Smith gave him an unidentifiable generic accent instead of an Afrikaans accent. His place of residence was also changed from Limpopo to Duckburg. The previously unaffiliated Beagle Boys were now depicted as working for him on an occasional basis. In \\"Attack of the Metal Mites\\", Glomgold sends the metal mites to eat whole money from Scrooge's bin. Glomgold almost succeeds when Fenton Crackshell stopped the metal mites and the last ones retrieved by Dijon spread in Glomgold's office. The biggest humiliation of all this is the fact Scrooge finds a way to earn honest money with the metal mites captured by Fenton. In the two-part episode \\"The Golden Goose\\", Glomgold almost beats Scrooge at being the world's richest duck with the help of the Golden Goose, until he gets turned into gold himself. Glomgold is also a recurring antagonist in the DuckTales comic book series, notably the series Scrooge's Quest. In the final chapter of that series, \\"All That Glitters Is Not Glomgold\\", Glomgold has taken advantage of Scrooge's long absence and distraction to buy out all of Scrooge's assets and seize control of Duckburg. While Scrooge was a more benevolent businessman, Glomgold is determined to soak the city's people for as much money as he can, charging exorbitant prices for food and services, while keeping their lives as closely regimented as possible. Scrooge cannily uses Glomgold's own paranoia against him, wandering around town, making apparently innocuous inspections of Glomgold's businesses, and causing Glomgold to tear apart his own holdings, looking for Scrooge's sabotage. By the end of the comic, Glomgold has destroyed all of his assets in Duckburg, and Scrooge has regained his own fortune. As Scrooge explains to his nephews, \\"Glomgold is so evil and sneaky that he thinks everyone is as evil and sneaky as he is.\\" Yet, in the final pages of the comic, Glomgold seems to be perfectly content, living in a wooden shanty in Duckburg's slums, sharing a meager meal with one of his former clerks. As Glomgold explains, now that he has nothing left, there's nothing further that Scrooge can do to him, and Glomgold is looking forward to making himself rich again, since making a fortune is much more satisfying than having one. In this he reflects much of Scrooge's own philosophy. In the Disney series Darkwing Duck episode \\"In Like Blunt\\", Glomgold makes a cameo appearance-along with the Beagle Boys and Magica De Spell-as a bidder for the secret S.H.U.S.H. agent list. Flintheart also appears in the 1989 DuckTales video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). After Scrooge completes all the regular levels, Flintheart challenges him to a race in which the winner will take all of the treasure Scrooge has acquired. Glomgold also appears in the 1993 video game sequel DuckTales 2, also for the NES, once again trying to obtain the treasures that Scrooge had collected and also kidnaps Webby in order to get Scrooge to hand over the treasure. When he does Glomgold is revealed to be the final boss the D-1000. In DuckTales: Remastered, Glomgold is voiced by Brian George (Hal Smith had died in 1994), and his role is greatly expanded. In Remastered, Glomgold attacks Scrooge in the Himalayas, attempting to shoot Launchpad out of the skies, but is thwarted by Scrooge. He appears again on the Moon, attempting to collect the Green Cheese of Longevity before Scrooge does. Later, he forms an uneasy alliance with Scrooge to help him rescue his nephews from Magica De Spell, but later reveals that he was in cahoots with her all along in order to get Scrooge's Number One Dime from him for her own purposes. As in the original, Scrooge must race Glomgold and Magica in order to reclaim his Number One Dime in the end. Glomgold appeared in Ducktales: Scrooge's Loot, and also as Boss in the RPG card game titled The Duckforce Rises for the Android and iOS. Glomgold is the main antagonist in the PC game DuckTales: The Quest for Gold. In the intro scene, he barges into Scrooge's office, lamenting about he is tired being the second richest duck in the world, and challenges Scrooge to a wealth contest sponsored by Dime Magazine: in the next 30 days, the one who collects the most treasure shall be the Duck of the Year. The contest is held in the Isle of Macaroon, which is a homage to the four-parter \\"Catch as Cash Can\\" episode, except that the contest gives 30 days, not 10. Just like in the episodes, Glomgold hires the Beagle Boys against Scrooge and his nephews, and will constantly try to race Scrooge to the treasure locations, or snatching treasure from other locations. The ultimate goal of the game is to collect more money, thus, beating Glomgold and becoming Duck of the Year. Glomgold appeared on the 2012 list of the Forbes Fictional 15, a compilation of the wealthiest characters in fiction. A spike in the price of gold during the late 2000s and early 2010s allowed Glomgold to become the second-wealthiest fictional character. His nemesis, Scrooge McDuck (who has appeared in most of the Fictional 15 lists to date), surpassed him in the 2013 list, in which Glomgold did not appear. Glomgold, now voiced by Keith Ferguson, returns as Scrooge's nemesis in the 2017 reboot of DuckTales. While Glomgold now appears much stouter than in previous versions, his outfit and personality remains relatively unchanged from the 1987 version. He is also the head of Glomgold Industries, through which he builds up his fortune through personal branding and making products as cheaply as possible. Throughout the first season, it was initially implied that this Glomgold is South African but pretends to be Scottish in order to outdo Scrooge McDuck. This is confirmed in the second season episode, \\"The Ballad of Duke Baloney!\\", where it's revealed that Glomgold was born Duke Baloney, a shoeshine boy who did Scrooge's shoes and given a dime as payment to teach him self-reliance; only for him to instead feel cheated and create his \\"Glomgold\\" persona over the years to get revenge. Predecessor A few years prior to Flintheart's debut, another character was described as the World's Second-Richest Duck. His only appearance took place in Carl Barks' story \\"Turkey With All the Schemings\\". In that story, Donald Duck found himself unable to afford a Christmas dinner and decided to trick Scrooge McDuck into paying for dinner for him. To do so, Donald posed as a South American businessman named Petrolio de Vaselino and had Scrooge take him to the Ritz. While eating dessert, Donald accidentally ate his phony moustache, making him look like the Duke of Baloni, described by Scrooge as the World's Second-Richest Duck. By coincidence, Scrooge had a newspaper article talking about the Duke visiting Duckburg. The fact Scrooge remained willing to make business with him suggests the Duke never claimed to be richer than him. Not much else is known about the real Duke since he just made a cameo at the beginning of the last page and his only purpose in the story was cluing (via his presence) Scrooge to the fact he was dealing with an imposter. After removing Donald's wig, Scrooge was determined to make Donald pay. He asked the waiter if the restaurant was for sale and was given a price of one million dollars. In a surprising move, as he had spent the whole last night trying to make sure Donald wouldn't leave and force him to pay the bill, Scrooge quickly pulled the required amount from his pockets and bought the restaurant. Donald then was forced to wash the dishes to pay the bill. It is never said when Flintheart became richer than the Duke or if the two ever met. However, this is homaged in the 2017 DuckTales animated series, where it is revealed that \\"Duke Baloney\\" is Flintheart's birth name.

The model name Samara originally was used only for exported models, in the Soviet Union the same model was called Sputnik (\\"fellow traveler\\", \\"satellite\\") until 1991, when the sedan version of the Samara entered in production, using the export name. It was the first front-wheel drive serial car built in the Soviet Union after the LuAZ-969V. The Samara had been modified and restyled during the years of production before it was finally discontinued in December 2013. Introduction VAZ 2108 Samara (3-door), shorter hood and fender of older versions The Samara was a car that combined a robust build and ease of maintenance with a modern style. It was produced in various three, four and five-door designs with 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5-litre petrol engines. Lada had hoped that the Samara would enable it to compete for sales in the mainstream European car market. It was the second autonomous design from AvtoVAZ (the first was the Niva SUV), and the first Lada car not based on the Fiat-derived mechanicals. Development Lada Samara 1500S five-door hatchback, longer hood and fender of newer versions VAZ had made their first front-wheel drive prototype, the VAZ-1101, in the early 1970s. The engine from the Fiat 127 was used. Further development of this project led to the Ladoga three-door hatchback prototype in 1976. The decision to build the Samara was taken on 16 September 1978, the intention being to build a car with strong potential sales in Western European export markets. Proposals for a distinctive saloon, four- door, and both three- and five-door hatchback were considered; it was decided instead the saloon should share the three-door hatchback's sheetmetal forward the C-pillar. (Design work on the four-door went toward the VAZ-2110 instead.) During its development, VAZ designers paid careful attention to the contemporary Renault 9, Volkswagen Golf, Ford Escort Mark III, Opel Kadett, and Volvo 340, which would be the new VAZ-2108's main competitors.Thompson, p. 251, mentions only the Kadett, 9, & Escort. Front suspension was MacPherson struts, rear by torsion bar. It also had rack and pinion steering, another Soviet first. On December 31, 1979, the first VAZ-2108 prototype was completed. It strongly resembled the earlier Ladoga, and the VAZ-1106 saloon. While named Sputnik at home, it was more commonly known as the Vos'merka (\\"Eighth\\") after the last digit in the model code. The export version was named after the Samara River, a tributary to the Volga. The first cars left the production line on 18 December 1984. These, the three-door hatchbacks (the only model available at first), were powered by a belt-driven SOHC inline- four, and were fitted with a four-speed gearbox. The three-door was joined by a five-door, and by models with (a destroked version of the 1288) or (a bored- out 1288) engines. (The head was developed in co-operation with Porsche, though most Western observers assumed Porsche's involvement went beyond just engines, and the carburetors in connection with Solex.) Rear view of the VAZ 21099 (Lada Sagona) four-door saloon In 1987, the model range was joined by the 21083, with a engine and five-speed gearbox, and the 21081, with a . The 1099 was an export-only variant. Top speeds were (1099), (1288) and (1499); fuel economy was (1099), (1288), or (1499). VAZ also debuted the 2109 five- door hatchback that year, also available with the , , and . In 1989, the 21099 saloon followed, which had a new bonnet, grille, wings, and -longer rear overhang, as well as an improved dashboard. The 21099's front-end styling was adopted on the 2109 in 1992 and the 2108 in 1994. A number of other minor alterations followed, including fuel-injected engines to meet emissions regulations in export markets. On the earlier Samaras the front clip had been a separate piece, surrounding the headlights. On the sedan version, the fenders go all the way up to the headlights and the lip of the bonnet dips between the headlights and meets the slimmer grille. Full production of the 21099 began in December 1990, with models 210993 (1288), 21099 (1499). The saloon, intended as a premium model compared to the hatchback, was given a distinctive branding in some export markets: Diva (Belgium), Sagona (France), Forma (Germany). Belgium also offered a locally built convertible.Thompson, p. 257 caption. The 1.1 and 1.3 were eventually taken out of production, having already been withdrawn from export markets. =Special models= A Wankel engined Samara three-door hatchback, the 2108-91, powered by a two-rotor VAZ-415 (with two rotors) was sold in Russia only, and only in very small numbers. With a five-speed gearbox, it was priced at a staggering 56,000 rubles. Due to severe reliability problems, this remained rare, most commonly bought by police and other agencies to use as a pursuit vehicle, for which its top speed was ideal; it was capable of in eight seconds. The subsequent 2109-91 five-door hatchback had the same VAZ-415 and gearbox. Lada Samara T3 Lada Tarzan (VAZ 210934) There were also a rear-engined Samara 4x4 rally car,(1985) also known as the NAMI 0290, built for the 1985 Soyuz Rally; it had permanent four-wheel drive and a Zhiguli-based engine, over the rear axle. It was nicknamed Appelsin (\\"orange\\", for its paint), and used ZAZ-1102 doors (though the body was mostly fiberglass, weighing only ) and, surprisingly, factory Samara wheels.Thompson, p. 258 caption. The 1987 mid-engined Samara- EVA had a turbocharged 16-valve engine (with electronic fuel injection) of ; a naturally-aspirated version produced . The only thing left untouched was the original Zhuguli 2106 block. An even more powerful Samara S-Proto appeared in 1989, putting out . Most notably, the Samara T3 came seventh in the 1990 Paris-Dakar Rally and fifth in 1991, piloted by Jacky Ickx. The T3 did not contain many Samara parts however, using the Porsche 959's four-wheel drive system and a 3.6-litre Porsche flat-six. It was developed by French concessionaire Lada-Poch together with NAMI and the Tupolev aircraft factory. In the mid-1980s Lada developed its first ever convertible car on its own, then actually entering production and quickly exported to most European countries, called the Lada Natasha Cabriolet, a four-seater convertible that was based on the popular Samara 1300/1500 models with a manual opening and closing canvas roof. Also in some European car markets the LADA Niva 4X4 1600 cc engine was also available for both the Lada Natasha and Lada Samara cars during the 1990s. Exports 1992 Lada Samara Cabriolet, also called \\"Natasha\\" The Samara was sold all across the world, from Australia to Canada, in most European countries and throughout the COMECON sphere. The build quality of the Samara was better than that of most Eastern European models. In most nations, versions and equipments were decided on and installed by the dealers themselves. These local varieties ranged from decals and badges to the convertible conversions offered in Belgium and Germany. The Samara was often sold under other names as well, in particular the VAZ 21099 (Samara Sedan), which was sold as the Sagona (France, Canada, and Spain), Diva (Belgium and the Netherlands), Forma (Germany) and Sable (Australia and New Zealand). It was engineered in right-hand drive for the UK market, where it was sold from November 1987. It was sold there until VAZ withdrew from the UK market in July 1997, and was the most popular Lada model sold in the UK during the 23 years that the brand was sold there. In certain markets where the tax structure benefited diesels (such as France and the Benelux), the Samara was available with a 1.5-litre Peugeot diesel engine in 1995‚Äì97. With VAZ facing financial hardships in 1996‚Äì1997, exports began coming to a halt. The Lada Samara disappeared from Canada after the 1997 model year, leaving the Niva as the only Lada sold in Canada for the 1998 model year. Exports to Australia and Great Britain ended around the same time. The biggest problem was GM's reluctance to sell the fuel-injection kits necessary for exports, as they doubted VAZ's ability to pay. Faced with parts shortages, tax problems, and the chaos and criminality of Russia in the mid-nineties,Ireland A. D., Hoskisson R., Hitt M. Understanding Business Strategy: Concepts and Cases. Cengage Learning. 2005. P. 145 export efforts languished and RHD production was no longer feasible. As a partial response to this situation, a higher- quality version for the European market, the Lada EuroSamara or Samara Baltic in some markets, was assembled in Finland at the Valmet Automotive plant in Uusikaupunki. Production started in mid-1996 and ended in July 1998, with 14,000 cars made from 85 per cent Russian parts. =British market= The United Kingdom had to wait nearly three years for the Samara to go on sale, after its launch in the USSR, but sales were reasonably strong when the first versions of the car left forecourts, in November 1987. In a road test conducted by The Motor magazine, it scored more than 5 points out of 10 in most aspects and was praised for having a remarkably extensive list of standard equipment, ‚Äúimpressive‚Äù engine, good visibility and performance for its price segment, lowered fuel consumption, being good at cornering and ‚Äútolerably quiet‚Äù, but also received criticism for having a cheap-looking interior and plastic mouldings and being ‚Äúvery turbulent‚Äù on poor roads.The Motor, December 5, 1987, pp. 40‚Äì41 The ¬£4,795 price at introduction \\"was much less expensive\\" than the competing Peugeot 309 or Ford Escort 1300. The Samara remained on sale in the United Kingdom right up to July 4, 1997, when the decision was made to withdraw from Great Britain and most other export markets.\\"Lada History in the UK\\", Lada Owners Club UK In countries where ruggedness was more important, it was more successful, selling reasonably well in Canada, Australia, and Finland for instance. Samara 1500 hatchback (UK, Dec '92) The attempt to appeal to a wider clientele failed; while an improvement over previous Ladas, the Samara's higher price pitched it against stiffer West European competition. By the time of the Samara's launch, the British small family car market was effectively split into two segments: The large mainstream market was dominated by mass-market manufacturers, such as Ford, Vauxhall, and Volkswagen. The budget market consisted of Eastern European and Far Eastern brands, such as ≈†koda, FSO, Hyundai, and Proton. The aging Samara came bottom of the annual 1996 and 1997 JD Power and Top Gear surveys in Great Britain. In countries where ruggedness was more important, it did manage some success, selling reasonably well in Canada, Australia, and Finland for instance. Versions Initially sold as a three- or five-door hatchback with a 1.3 petrol engine, a 1.5 version became available in October 1988. Metallic paint became an option for the first time in November 1989 when the 1.5 SLX was launched. A new entry-level model arrived in July 1990 when the 1.1 petrol engine was added to the range (Select or L). An updated version of the Samara was launched in April 1991, with all new trim levels. This was followed by the introduction of the VAZ 21099 saloon version 15 months later. The saloon also became available as a sporty 1.5 \\"Juno\\" from July 1994, featuring alloy wheels, swoopy, ill-fitting sideskirts and a rear spoiler. A fuel injected engine became available on the 1.3 and 1.5 models in August 1996.Lada Cars in the UK, Lada Owners Club UK =Australian market= 1991 Lada Samara 1300 5-door hatchback (Australia) The Samara was introduced into the Australian market in July 1988, and was offered in three-door and convertible body styles. A three-door variant called the Bizivan was also offered, which was sold without rear seats in order to qualify as a commercial van, and therefore, lower import duties. In 1990, the range was pared down to a single five-door model, marketed as the Lada Cevaro. The 3-door returned in 1994 as the Lada Volante and the four-door was introduced as the Lada Sable. Imports had ceased by 1996.The Red Book, retrieved from www.redbook.com.au on 14 September 2009 In 1988, approximately 6,000 Lada Samaras were modified by Peter Brock's Special Vehicles operation that had previously made high performance Holden Commodores. The cars would be known as the Lada Samara Sedan Brock Delux and included a few subtle Brock-devised suspension tweaks to improve the car's low-speed ride, as well as a special body kit. It cost about A$3,000 more than the base model Samara. Samara 2 Lada 2115 rear After 1997, the Samara was mostly sold in its homeland only, although it was still sold in some foreign markets with less strict emissions regulations. The Samara 2, a lightly facelifted version with a fuel-injected version of the 1,499 cc engine and a better gearbox, went on sale in limited numbers as the 2115 (four-door sedan) in 1997, built at the VAZ special vehicles unit. Brakes and interior were also upgraded, incorporating parts from the VAZ 2110. Full production on the main line in Togliatti began in 2000, in 2002 a five-door (2114) was added and the 2113 three-door followed in September 2004. The three-door was not originally planned to be built, but was added as a response to strong dealer demand. The last first generation Samara rolled off the Togliatti production line in 2004, ending 20 years of production there. Production of the \\"classic\\" Samara 2109/21099 continued at ZAZ in Ukraine as of 2004, and from May 2007 in Kazakhstan (Azia Avto). In January 2007, an upgraded Samara 2, using the modern 1.6-litre VAZ-11183-20 engine first seen in the VAZ 2110 went on sale. While the Lada 110 and the Lada Priora have taken much of the Samara's market share at home, the Samara retains a clear price advantage and steady demand.

Goofy is a tall, anthropomorphic dog who typically wears a turtle neck and vest, with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled fedora. Goofy is a close friend of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. He is normally characterized as hopelessly clumsy and dim-witted, yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as intuitive and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way. Goofy debuted in animated cartoons, starting in 1932 with Mickey's Revue as Dippy Dawg, who is older than Goofy would come to be. Later the same year, he was re-imagined as a younger character, now called Goofy, in the short The Whoopee Party. During the 1930s, he was used extensively as part of a comedy trio with Mickey and Donald. Starting in 1939, Goofy was given his own series of shorts that were popular in the 1940s and early 1950s. Two Goofy shorts were nominated for an Oscar: How to Play Football (1944) and Aquamania (1961). He also co-starred in a short series with Donald, including Polar Trappers (1938), where they first appeared without Mickey Mouse. Three more Goofy shorts were produced in the 1960s after which Goofy was only seen in television and Disney comics. He returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with Mickey's Christmas Carol. His last theatrical appearance was How to Hook Up Your Home Theater in 2007. Goofy has also been featured in television, most extensively in Goof Troop (1992), House of Mouse (2001‚Äì2003), Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006‚Äì2016), Mickey Mouse (2013‚Äìpresent), and Mickey and the Roadster Racers (2017‚Äìpresent). Originally known as Dippy Dawg, the character is more commonly known simply as \\"Goofy\\", a name used in his short film series. In his 1950s cartoons, he usually played a character called George G. Geef. Sources from the Goof Troop continuity give the character's full name as G. G. \\"Goofy\\" Goof,: Goofy's diploma, as read aloud by the How-to Narrator, refers to him by the formal name of \\"Mr. G. G. Goof\\": Goofy's old high school yearbook from Spoonerville High writes Goofy's name as \\"Goofy\\" Goof, with the name \\"Goofy\\" written in quotation marks as though it were his nickname. likely in reference to the 1950s name. In many other sources, both animated and comics, the surname Goof continues to be used. In other 2000s-era comics, the character's full name has occasionally been given as Goofus D. Dawg. Background According to Pinto Colvig, the original voice artist for the character, Goofy was inspired by a \\"grinny, half-baked village nitwit\\" from his hometown of Jacksonville, Oregon, and he had previously used his mannerisms for a stage character he created named \\"The Oregon Appleknocker\\". After a discussion with Walt Disney and director Wilfred Jackson, it was decided that this would be the basis for a new member of the expanding Mickey Mouse cast. Colvig would spend the next day in the recording studio acting out the new cartoon character in front of animator Tom Palmer. Based on Colvig's \\"grotesque poses and expressions\\", Palmer would sketch out what would become Goofy. Animator Art Babbit is credited for developing his character. In a 1930s lecture, Babbitt described the character as: \\"Think of the Goof as a composite of an everlasting optimist, a gullible Good Samaritan, a half-wit, a shiftless, good-natured hick\\". In the comics and his pre-1992 animated appearances, Goofy was usually single and childless. Unlike Mickey and Donald, he didn't have a steady girlfriend. The exception was the 1950s cartoons, in which Goofy played a character called George Geef who was married and at one point became the father of a kid named George Junior. In the Goof Troop series (1992‚Äì1993), however, Goofy was portrayed as a single father with a son named Max, and the character of Max made further animated appearances until 2004. This marked a division between animation and comics, as the latter kept showing Goofy as a single childless character, excluding comics taking place in the Goof Troop continuity. After 2004, Max disappeared from animation, thus removing the division between the two media. Goofy's wife was never shown, while George Geef's wife appeared‚Äîbut always with her face unseen‚Äîin 1950s-produced cartoon shorts depicting the character as a \\"family man\\".Officially, Disney's Guest Services once declared there to be \\"no definitive answer\\" as to \\"who Max's mother is and where \\"Mrs. Goofy\\" went\\", leaving her fate up to unofficial speculation and presumption. Goofy's house at Disneyland. In the comics, Goofy usually appears as Mickey's sidekick, though he also is occasionally shown as a protagonist.Chronological list of Goofy's appearances in comics according to the INDUCKS database. For each story, the database lists the featured characters and the protagonist mentioned in the title. Goofy lives in Mouseton in the comics and in Spoonerville in Goof Troop. In comics books and strips, Goofy's closest relatives are his nephew Gilbert, his adventurer cousin Arizona Goof (original Italian name: Indiana Pipps), who is a spoof of the fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones, and his grandmother, simply called Grandma Goofy. Goofy's catchphrases are \\"gawrsh!\\" (which is his usual exclamation of surprise and his way of pronouncing \\"gosh\\"), along with \\"ah-hyuck!\\" (a distinctive chuckle) that is sometimes followed by a \\"hoo hoo hoo hoo!\\", and especially the Goofy holler. In the classic shorts, he would sometimes say \\"Somethin' wrong here\\" (first heard in Lonesome Ghosts) whenever he suspected something was not right about the situation he was currently in, or sing a few bars of \\"The World Owes Me a Livin'\\" from The Grasshopper and the Ants (the first instance of Goofy singing this song is On Ice). According to biographer Neal Gabler, Walt Disney disliked the Goofy cartoons, thinking they were merely \\"stupid cartoons with gags tied together\\" with no larger narrative or emotional engagement and a step backward to the early days of animation. As such, he threatened constantly to terminate the series, but only continued it to provide make-work for his animators. Animation historian Michael Barrier is skeptical of Gabler's claim, saying that his source did not correspond with what was written. Appearances =Early years= Goofy, anonymous in his debut cartoon, Mickey's Revue (1932). Goofy first appeared in Mickey's Revue, first released on May 25, 1932. Directed by Wilfred Jackson this short movie features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Horace Horsecollar and Clarabelle Cow performing another song and dance show. Mickey and his gang's animated shorts by this point routinely featured song and dance numbers. It begins as a typical Mickey cartoon of the time, but what would set this short apart from all that had come before was the appearance of a new character, whose behavior served as a running gag. Dippy Dawg, as he was named by Disney artists (Frank Webb), was a member of the audience. He constantly irritated his fellow spectators by noisily crunching peanuts and laughing loudly, until two of those fellow spectators knocked him out with their mallets (and then did the same exact laugh as he did). This early version of Goofy had other differences with the later and more developed ones besides the name. He was an old man with a white beard, a puffy tail, and no trousers, shorts, or undergarments. But the short introduced Goofy's distinct laughter. This laughter was provided by Pinto Colvig. A considerably younger Dippy Dawg then appeared in The Whoopee Party, first released on September 17, 1932, as a party guest and a friend of Mickey and his gang. Dippy Dawg made a total of four appearances in 1932 and two more in 1933, but most of them were mere cameos. In the Silly Symphonies cartoon The Grasshopper and the Ants, the Grasshopper had an aloof character similar to Goofy and shared the same voice (Pinto Colvig) as the Goofy character. By his seventh appearance, in Orphan's Benefit first released on August 11, 1934, he gained the new name \\"Goofy\\" and became a regular member of the gang along with two other new characters: Donald Duck and Clara Cluck. =Trio years with Mickey and Donald= Mickey's Service Station directed by Ben Sharpsteen, first released on March 16, 1935, was the first of the classic \\"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\\" comedy shorts. Those films had the trio trying to cooperate in performing a certain assignment given to them. Early on they became separated from each other. Then the short's focus started alternating between each of them facing the problems at hand, each in their own way and distinct style of comedy. The end of the short would reunite the three to share the fruits of their efforts, failure more often than success. Clock Cleaners, first released on October 15, 1937, and Lonesome Ghosts, first released on December 24, 1937, are usually considered the highlights of this series and animated classics. Progressively during the series, Mickey's part diminished in favor of Donald, Goofy, and Pluto. The reason for this was simple: Between the easily frustrated Donald and Pluto and the always-living- in-a-world-of-his-own Goofy, Mickey‚Äîwho became progressively gentler and more laid-back‚Äîseemed to act as the straight man of the trio. The studio's artists found that it had become easier coming up with new gags for Goofy or Donald than Mickey, to a point that Mickey's role had become unnecessary. Polar Trappers, first released on June 17, 1938, was the first film to feature Goofy and Donald as a duo. The short features the duo as partners and owners of \\"Donald and Goofy Trapping Co.\\" They have settled in the Arctic for an unspecified period of time, to capture live walruses to bring back to civilization. Their food supplies consist of canned beans. The focus shifts between Goofy trying to set traps for walruses and Donald trying to catch penguins to use as food ‚Äî both with the same lack of success. Mickey would return in The Whalers, first released on August 19, 1938, but this and also Tugboat Mickey, released on April 26, 1940, would be the last two shorts to feature all three characters as a team. =Break off into solo series= Goofy next starred at his first solo cartoon Goofy and Wilbur directed by Dick Huemer, first released on March 17, 1939. The short featured Goofy fishing with the help of Wilbur, his pet grasshopper. =The How to... series= Disney drawing Goofy for a group of girls in Argentina, 1941. In 1938, one year after his last session as the character, Colvig had a falling out with Disney and left the studio, leaving Goofy without a voice. According to Leonard Maltin, this is what caused the How to... cartoons of the 1940s in which Goofy had little dialogue, and a narrator (often John McLeish) was used (they would also reuse Colvig's voice in recording or hire a man named Danny Webb to imitate it). In the cartoons, Goofy would demonstrate clumsily but always determined and never frustrated, how to do everything from snow ski to sleeping, to football, to riding a horse. The Goofy How to... cartoons worked so well that they became a staple format, and are still used in current Goofy shorts, the latest being the How to Hook Up Your Home Theater, released theatrically in 2007. Later, starting with How to Play Baseball (1942), Goofy starred in a series of cartoons where every single character in the cartoon was a different version of Goofy. This took Goofy out of the role of just being a clumsy cartoon character and into an Everyman figure. Colvig returned to Disney in 1940 and resumed the voice of Goofy three years later. Many of the Goofy cartoons were directed by Jack Kinney. =World War II= During World War II Goofy was drafted and became the mascot emblem of the 602nd Bombardment Squadron and the 756 Bombardment Squadron U.S. Air Corps. File:602d Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png602nd Bombardment Squadron emblem (approved 6 March 1944)Maurer, Combat Squadrons , pp. 680-681 File:756th Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png756th Bombardment Squadron emblem =The Everyman years= Goofy in his \\"George Geef\\" persona in (1951). The 1950s saw Goofy transformed into a family man going through the trials of everyday life, such as dieting, giving up smoking, and the problems of raising children. Walt Disney himself came up with this idea,Harry Tytle One Of \\"Walt's Boys,\\" (Mission Viejo, 1997) pg 86 hoping it would put personality back into the character that he felt was lost when Goofy was merely a crowd of extras. Goofy is never called \\"Goofy\\" during this period. While every cartoon continued with the opening, \\"Walt Disney presents Goofy\\" before each cartoon's title, he was usually called \\"George Geef\\" in the cartoons' dialogue. When the stories featured Goofy as multiple characters, then he had numerous other names as well. In addition, the 1950s Goofy shorts gave Goofy a makeover. He was more intelligent, had smaller eyes with eyebrows, often his whole body was pale instead of just his face (while the rest was black), and sometimes had a normal voice. He even lacked his droopy ears, the external pair of teeth and white gloves in some shorts. According to animation historian Christopher P. Lehman, Disney had started casting Goofy as a suburban everyman in the late 1940s. And with this role came changes in depiction. Goofy's facial stubble and his protruding teeth were removed to give him a more refined look.Lehman (2007), p. 27-28 His clothing changed from a casual style to wearing business suits. He began to look more human and less dog-like, with his ears hidden in his hat. By 1951, Goofy was portrayed as being married and having a son of his own. Neither the wife nor the son was portrayed as dog-like. The wife's face was never seen, but her form was human. The son lacked Goofy's dog-like ears. Lehman connects this depiction of the character to Disney's use of humor and animal characters to reinforce social conformity. He cites as an example Aquamania (1961), where everyman Goofy drives to the lake for a boat ride. During a scene depicting a pile-up accident, every car involved has a boat hitched to its rear bumper. Goofy is portrayed as one of the numerous people who had the same idea about how to spend their day. Every contestant in the boat race also looks like Goofy. Lehman does not think that Disney used these aspects of the film to poke fun at conformity. Instead, the studio apparently accepted conformity as a fundamental aspect of the society of the United States. Aquamania was released in the 1960s, but largely maintained and prolonged the status quo of the 1950s. The decade had changed but the Disney studio followed the same story formulas for theatrical animated shorts it had followed in the previous decade. And Lehman points that Disney received social approval for it. Aquamania itself received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. =Later appearances= After the 1965 educational film Goofy's Freeway Troubles, Goofy was mostly retired except for cameos, because of the fading popularity, and the death of the voice actor Pinto Colvig. Goofy had an act in the 1969 tour show, Disney on Parade with costar Herbie the Love Bug. He only makes a brief appearance in Disney/Amblin's Academy Award-winning hit Who Framed Roger Rabbit, in which the titular Roger Rabbit says of Goofy: \\"Nobody takes a whollup like Goofy! What timing! What finesse! What a genius!\\". However, he made a comeback in Mickey's Christmas Carol as the ghost of Jacob Marley. After that, he appeared in Sport Goofy in Soccermania which was originally intended to be released theatrically in 1984 but was aired as a 1987 TV special instead. His popularity then rose again. With Colvig dead, Goofy was then voiced with different voice actors until Bill Farmer became the official voice. Goofy (right) with his son Max (left) in A Goofy Movie (1995) In the 1990s, Goofy got his own TV series called Goof Troop. In the show, Goofy lives with his son Max and his cat Waffles, and they live next door to Pete and his family. Goof Troop eventually led to Goofy and Max starring in their own movies: A Goofy Movie (in 1995) and An Extremely Goofy Movie (in 2000); as well as starring in their own segments of Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas (in 1999) and Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas (in 2004). While Goofy is clearly depicted as a single custodial parent in all of these appearances, by the end of An Extremely Goofy Movie he begins a romance with the character Sylvia Marpole, Max being grown and in college by this point. In one episode of Bonkers, Goofy has an off- screen cameo whose distinctive laugh is \\"stolen\\" by a disgruntled toon. In another episode, both he and Pete cameo as actors who film cartoons at Wackytoon Studios. And in a third episode, Goofy cameos as part of a group of civilians held hostage in a bank robbery. Goofy returned to his traditional personality in Mickey Mouse Works and appeared as a head waiter in House of Mouse (2001 to 2004). Goofy's son Max also appeared in House of Mouse as the nightclub's valet, so that Goofy juggled not only his conventional antics but also the father-role displayed in Goof Troop and its aforementioned related media. In both Mickey Mouse Works and House of Mouse, Goofy also seemed to have a crush on Clarabelle Cow, as he asks her on a date in the House of Mouse episode \\"Super Goof\\" and is stalked by the bovine in the Mickey Mouse Works cartoon \\"How To Be a Spy\\". Though Clarabelle was noted as Horace Horsecollar's fianc√© in early decades, comics from the 1960s and 1970s and in later cartoons like the aforementioned House of Mouse and Mickey Mouse Works, as well as Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers, imply some mutual affections between Goofy and Clarabelle; perhaps as an attempt for Disney to give Goofy a more mainstream girlfriend to match his two male co-stars. On Disney's Toontown Online, an interactive website for kids, Goofy previously ran his own neighborhood called Goofy Speedway until the close of Toontown. Goofy Speedway was a place where you could race cars and enter the Grand Prix, too. Tickets were exclusively spent on everything there, instead of the usual jellybean currency. The Grand Prix only came on \\"Grand Prix Monday\\" and \\"Silly Saturday\\". Goofy's Gag Shop was also found in almost every part of Toontown' except Cog HQs, Goofy Speedway, or Chip & Dale's Acorn Acres. At Goofy's Gag Shop, Toons could buy gags. Goofy also appears in the children's television series, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, with his trademark attire and personality. Goofy appeared in The Lion King 1¬Ω. Goofy starred in a new theatrical cartoon short called How to Hook Up Your Home Theater, that premiered at the Ottawa International Animation Festival. The short received a positive review from animation historian Jerry Beck and then had a wide release on December 21, 2007, in front of National Treasure: Book of Secrets and has aired on several occasions on the Disney Channel. In 2011, Goofy appeared in a promotional webtoon advertising Disney Cruise Line. He is also a main character on Mickey and the Roadster Racers. He has also appeared in the third season of the 2017 DuckTales TV series; based on his Goof Troop incarnation. Guest starring in the episode, \\"Quack Pack\\", Goofy appears as the Duck family's wacky neighbor after Donald accidentally wished them into a '90s sitcom. Donald hires him to be the photographer for a family photo, but after the Ducks realize what Donald did, Goofy helps him understand that \\"normal\\" doesn't necessarily mean the same thing between families; using the relationship he has with his son Max as an example.

In the early years, the other members of Mickey Mouse's gang considered him a meddler and a pest but eventually warmed up to him. The Mickey Mouse comic strip drawn by Floyd Gottfredson was generally based on what was going on in the Mickey Mouse shorts at the time, but when Donald Duck's popularity led to Donald Duck gaining his own newspaper strip, Disney decided that he was no longer allowed to appear in Gottfredson's strips. Accordingly, Goofy remained alone as Mickey's sidekick, replacing Horace Horsecollar as Mickey's fellow adventurer and companion. Similarly in comics, the Mickey Mouse world with Goofy as Mickey's sidekick was usually very separate from the Donald Duck world and crossovers were rare. Goofy also has a characteristic habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth, a trademark that was introduced by Paul Murry. A character called \\"Glory-Bee\\" was Goofy's girlfriend for some years. In 1990, when Disney was publishing their own comics, Goofy starred in Goofy Adventures, that featured him starring in various parodies. Unfortunately, perhaps because of poor sales, Goofy Adventures was the first of the company's titles to be canceled by the Disney Comics Implosion, ending at its 17th issue. =Super Goof= Super Goof is Goofy's superhero alter ego who gets his powers by eating super goobers (peanuts). Goofy became the first Disney character to also be a superhero, but several would follow, including Donald Duck as Paperinik. The initial concept was developed by Disney Publications Dept. head George Sherman and Disney United Kingdom merchandising representative Peter Woods. It was passed on to Western Publishing scripter Del Connell who refined it, including the eventual device of peanuts providing superpowers. The initial version of Super Goof appeared in \\"The Phantom Blot meets Super Goof\\", in Walt Disney's The Phantom Blot #2 (Feb. 1965) by Connell (story) and Paul Murry (art). There Goofy mistakenly believes he has developed superpowers.Walt Disney's The Phantom Blot #2 at the Grand Comics Database. \\"This Super Goof is not the character from Super Goof (Gold Key, 1965). This one is just Goofy dressed up as a super-hero and fooled into thinking he has powers when he doesn't.\\" A second version appeared as an actual superhero in the four-page story \\"All's Well That Ends Awful\\" in Donald Duck #102 (July 1965), also by Connell and Murry.Super Goof at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on January 1, 2018.\\"All's Well that Ends Awful\\", Donald Duck #102 at the Grand Comics Database. \\"First strong Super Goof\\". The third and definitive version debuted in \\"The Thief of Zanzipar\\" in Walt Disney Super Goof #1 (Oct. 1965), written by Bob Ogle and drawn by Murry, in which the origin of his powers are special peanuts Goofy finds in his backyard.Walt Disney Super Goof #1 at the Grand Comics Database.\\"The Thief of Zanzipar\\": Origin of Super Goof at the INDUCKS. In this story, Super Goof battles the Super Thief, a scientific genius who shrinks world landmarks, and holds them for ransom. The effect of Super Goof's special peanuts is temporary, so the superpowers wear off after a couple of hours. Many stories use this as a comical effect with the powers wearing off at the most inappropriate time. The peanuts give similar superpowers to whoever eats them, not just Goofy. In some stories, random criminals who have accidentally eaten the peanuts have temporarily become supervillains. In a crossover story, Huey, Dewey and Louie found a super goober plant sprouted by a dropped goober, and \\"borrowed\\" Super Goof's powers; after doing a round of super deeds, the ducks' powers faded, and they had to be rescued by the Junior Woodchucks.\\"The Super Good Woodchucks\\" in Huey, Dewey and Louie Junior Woodchucks #27 (July 1974) at the INDUCKS.

Gold Key Comics subsequently published the comic-book series Walt Disney Super Goof for 74 issues through 1984.Walt Disney Super Goof at the Grand Comics Database. A handful of stories were scripted by Mark Evanier. Additional Super Goof stories (both original and reprints) appeared in Walt Disney Comics Digest.Super Goof in Walt Disney Comics Digest at the Grand Comics Database. The Dynabrite comics imprint issued by Western in the late 1970s and Disney Comic Album #8 (1990) from Disney Comics contained reprints. Gemstone reprinted a Disney Studio Program story written by Evanier and drawn by Jack Bradbury as a backup in its 2006 release Return of the Blotman. On Disney's Toontown Online during the Halloween season, Goofy is Super Goof for the occasion. He also appeared in one episode of Disney's House of Mouse and in two episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. In the Disney Channel Mickey Mouse TV series, Goofy dresses as Super Goof for the half-hour Halloween special. In video games =Kingdom Hearts series= Goofy, as he appears in the Kingdom Hearts series. His attire was designed by Tetsuya Nomura. Goofy is the captain of the royal guard at Disney Castle in the Kingdom Hearts video game series. Averse to using actual weapons, Goofy fights with a shield. Following a letter left by the missing king Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald, the court magician, meet Sora and embark on a quest with him to find the King and Sora's missing friends. In the game series, Goofy still suffers from being the butt of comic relief, but also is the constant voice of optimism and, surprisingly, selectively perceptive, often noticing things others miss and keeping his cool when Sora and Donald lose it. Goofy's loyalty was also tested when Riku wielded the Keyblade thus, following the king's orders, he followed Riku instead. As Riku was about to attack Sora, Goofy used his shield to protect Sora; thus disobeying the king. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter the realm known as Timeless River, Goofy states that the world looks familiar; a reference to his cartoons done in the early to mid-1930s. At many times in the Kingdom Hearts series, Goofy is shown to still be his clumsy self, however, in Kingdom Hearts II, he is very keen to details and has very accurate assumptions of certain things. For example, he was the first to figure out why Organization XIII was after the Beast, and he was the first to see through Fa Mulan's disguise and discovery that Mulan was actually a woman dressed as a male soldier. There were even several instances where Goofy seemed to have more common sense than Sora and Donald, even saying they should \\"look before we leap\\" when Sora and Donald saw Mushu's shadow resembling a dragon, that Sora had mistaken for a Heartless. Goofy reappears in the prequel, Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, in a relatively minor role, having accompanied Mickey (along with Donald) to Yen Sid's tower to watch Mickey's Mark of Mastery Exam. Upon realizing that Mickey has been abducted and taken to the Keyblade Graveyard by Master Xehanort in an attempt to lure Ventus out, Goofy and Donald prepare to venture out to rescue Mickey, but as they will obviously be no match for Master Xehanort, Ventus goes alone. Donald and Goofy later care for their King as he recuperates from his injuries. =In other video games= *Goofy was the star of an early platformer, Matterhorn Screamer, for the Apple II and Commodore 64. * Goofy appears as the owner (or perhaps simply the cashier) of the \\"Junk\\" store in Donald Duck's Playground, developed and published in the 1980s by Sierra On-Line for the Commodore 64, IBM PC, Apple II, Amiga, and Atari ST. * Goofy also starred in Super NES action game Goof Troop alongside his son Max and in Goofy's Hysterical History Tour for the Sega Genesis where he's ahead janitor and he must recover the missing pieces of some museum exhibits. * Goofy appears briefly in Quackshot, a Genesis game that starred Donald Duck. Goofy is located within the ancient ruins in Mexico and gives Donald the red plunger (an upgrade to Donald's plunger gun allows the climbing of walls) and a strange note that solves a puzzle in Egypt later in the game. * He also was in the Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance game Disney's Party as one of the playable characters. * Two games for kids were released: Goofy's Fun House for the PlayStation and Goofy's Railway Express for the Commodore 64. * He also appears 2001 in Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding for PC. * Goofy is a playable character in Disney TH!NK Fast. * Concept art for Goofy was made for his appearance in the 2009 & 2010 Wii game, Epic Mickey. He appears as one of the \\"buddies\\" that the Mad Doctor creates for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit to replicate the facade of Mickey Mouse's success. A variation of him seems to appear as a minor shopkeeper named Tiki Sam. * Goofy briefly appears in Disney's Magical Quest for Super NES, released in 1992. * As noted above, Goofy appears in Disney's online game Toontown Online. * Goofy was also a playable character in Disney Golf for the PS2. * Goofy is one the eight playable racers in the GBA game Disney Kart: Circuit Tour. Voice actors Pinto Colvig voiced Goofy for most of his classic appearances from 1932 (Mickey's Revue) to 1938 (The Whalers) when he had a fallout with Disney and left the company to work on other projects. He was later replaced by Danny Webb from 1939 to 1941. However, Colvig returned to Disney and resumed the role in 1944 (How to Be a Sailor) until shortly before his death in 1967. One of his last known performances as the character was for the Telephone Pavilion at Expo 67. Many cartoons feature Goofy silent or have recycled dialogue from earlier shorts or have various different-sounding Goofys instead of the original. Colvig also gave Goofy a normal voice for four George Geef shorts. Stuart Buchanan voiced Goofy in The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air. Bob Jackman took Colvig's place when he left the Disney Studios for unknown reasons and voiced Goofy in 1951 for a brief time. Jimmy MacDonald, the voice of Mickey Mouse, voiced Goofy in the 1960s Disney album, Donald Duck and his Friends. Jack Bailey also voiced Goofy in several Donald Duck cartoons. Bill Lee provided the singing voice for Goofy on the 1964 record, Children's Riddles and Game Songs.\\"Walt Disney's Goofy- on the Record\\". Retrieved 2018-04-19. Hal Smith began voicing Goofy in 1967 after Pinto Colvig's death and voiced him until Mickey's Christmas Carol in 1983. Will Ryan did the voice for DTV Valentine in 1986 and Down and Out with Donald Duck in 1987. Tony Pope voiced Goofy in the 1979 Disney album, Mickey Mouse Disco for the song, \\"Watch out for Goofy\\". He then voiced him in Sport Goofy in Soccermania in 1987 and Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988. Aside from those occasions, Bill Farmer has been voicing Goofy since 1987. While Pope was the sole voice credit for Goofy in Roger Rabbit, Farmer actually provided some of Goofy's lines in the movie as well.2011 Disneyana Fan Club Convention Highlight: Voice Panel Farmer closely imitated Colvig for projects like The Prince and the Pauper but began putting his own spin on the character in 1992's Goof Troop. Farmer also inherited Colvig's other characters, like Pluto, Sleepy, and Practical Pig. Relatives =Max Goof= Max Goof is Goofy's teenage son. He first appeared in the 1992 television series Goof Troop and stars in both the spin-off film A Goofy Movie (1995) and its direct- to-video sequel An Extremely Goofy Movie (2000). He also features in the direct-to-video Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas (1999), its sequel Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas (2004), and the 2001 TV series House of Mouse. Max is a playable character on the Super NES video game Goof Troop (1993), the PlayStation 2 video game Disney Golf (2002), and the PC video game Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding (2001). Max is one of the few Disney characters aside from his best friend P.J. and Huey, Dewey, and Louie, child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He was depicted as an eleven-year-old middle school student in Goof Troop, then a high school student in A Goofy Movie, and then a high school graduate teenager starting college in An Extremely Goofy Movie. In Disney's House of Mouse, he is still a teenager but old enough to be employed as a parking valet. Goofy holler The Goofy holler is a stock sound effect that is used frequently in Walt Disney cartoons and films. It is the cry Goofy makes when falling or being launched into the air, that can be transcribed as \\"Yaaaaaaa-hoo-hoo-hoo- hooey!\\" The holler was originally recorded by yodeller Hann√®s Schroll for the 1941 short The Art of Skiing. Some sources claim that Schrolle was not paid for the recording. Bill Farmer, the current voice of Goofy, demonstrated the \\"Goofy Holler\\" in the Disney Treasures DVD The Complete Goofy. He also does this in the Kingdom Hearts games. The holler is also used in films and cartoons in which Goofy does not appear, generally in situations that are particularly \\"goofy\\" (examples include Cinderella, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Pete's Dragon, The Rescuers, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Home on the Range, Enchanted, and Moana). In a Batman: The Animated Series episode titled \\"The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\\", the Joker performs the holler when the plane crashes toward a canyon. In the \\"Wacky Delly\\" episode of Rocko's Modern Life, the holler is heard at the end of the haphazardly made cartoon created by Rocko, Heffer Wolfe, and Filburt for Ralph Bighead. A version of the holler is used in a cutaway in the \\"Dial Meg for Murder\\" episode of Family Guy when Goofy is cast into Hell for causing 9/11. The term \\"Goofy Holler\\" was first created by a user of the Internet Movie Database and originated on the trivia page for A Goofy Movie. It is now generally considered the name for the sound effect. In Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, however, it is referenced as \\"Goofy Yell\\".

Formed in 1965, the group defined the San Francisco Sound and was the first from the Bay Area to achieve international commercial success. They were headliners at the Monterey Pop Festival (1967), Woodstock (1969), Altamont Free Concert (1969), and the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968) in England. Their 1967 break-out album Surrealistic Pillow ranks on the short list of the most significant recordings of the Summer of Love. Two songs from that album, \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\", are among Rolling Stones \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". The October 1966 to February 1970 lineup of Jefferson Airplane, consisting of Marty Balin (vocals), Paul Kantner (guitar, vocals), Grace Slick (vocals), Jorma Kaukonen (lead guitar, vocals), Jack Casady (bass), and Spencer Dryden (drums), was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Marty Balin left the band in 1971. After 1972, Jefferson Airplane effectively split into two groups. Kaukonen and Casady moved on full- time to their own band, Hot Tuna. Slick, Kantner, and the remaining members of Jefferson Airplane recruited new members and regrouped as Jefferson Starship in 1974, with Marty Balin eventually joining them. Jefferson Airplane was presented with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016. History =1965‚Äì1966: Formation= In 1962, 20-year-old Marty Balin recorded two singles for Challenge Records, neither of which was successful. Balin then joined a folk group called the Town Criers from 1963 to 1964. After the Beatles-led British Invasion of 1964, Balin was inspired by the success of the Byrds and Simon & Garfunkel in merging folk with rock to form a group in 1965 that would follow that lead. With a group of investors, Balin purchased a former pizza parlor on Fillmore Street, which he converted to a music club, the Matrix, and began searching for members for his group. Balin met folk musician Paul Kantner at another local club, the Drinking Gourd. Kantner, a native San Franciscan, had started out performing on the Bay Area folk circuit in the early 1960s, alongside fellow folkies Jerry Garcia, David Crosby and Janis Joplin. Kantner has cited folk groups like the Kingston Trio and the Weavers as strong early influences. He briefly moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1964 to work in a folk duo with future Airplane/Starship member David Freiberg (who subsequently joined Quicksilver Messenger Service). Balin and Kantner then recruited other musicians to form the house band at the Matrix. After hearing female vocalist Signe Toly Anderson at the Drinking Gourd, Balin invited her to be the group's co-lead singer. Anderson sang with the band for a year and performed on their first album before departing in October 1966 after the birth of her first child. Kantner next recruited an old friend, blues guitarist Jorma Kaukonen. Originally from Washington, D.C., Kaukonen had moved to California in the early 1960s and met Kantner while at Santa Clara University in 1962. Kaukonen was invited to jam with the new band, and although initially reluctant to join, he was won over after playing his guitar through a tape delay device that was part of the sound system used by Ken Kesey for his Acid Test parties. Kaukonen came up with the band's name, based on the name of a friend's dog. A 2007 press release quoted Kaukonen as saying: Jefferson Airplane in early 1966. From left: Anderson, Casady, Balin, Spence, Kantner and Kaukonen. The group in 1966 after Spencer Dryden replaced Skip Spence on drums. Jefferson Airplane Fillmore poster, February 1966. This was the first non-benefit concert held at the venue. Drummer Jerry Peloquin and acoustic bassist Bob Harvey completed the original lineup. The group made its first public appearance as Jefferson Airplane at the opening night of The Matrix on August 13, 1965. The band expanded from its folk roots, drawing inspiration from the Beatles, the Byrds and the Lovin' Spoonful, and gradually developed a more pop-oriented electric sound. A few weeks after the group was formed, Jerry Peloquin departed, in part because of his disdain for the others' drug use. Although he was not a drummer, singer-guitarist Skip Spence (who later founded Moby Grape) was then invited to replace Peloquin. In October 1965, after the other members decided that Bob Harvey's bass playing was not up to par, he was replaced by guitarist-bassist Jack Casady, an old friend of Kaukonen from Washington, D.C. Casady played his first gig with the Airplane at a college concert in Berkeley, California, two weeks after he arrived in San Francisco. The group's performing skills improved rapidly and they soon gained a strong following in and around San Francisco, aided by reviews from veteran music journalist Ralph J. Gleason, the jazz critic of the San Francisco Chronicle who, after seeing them at the Matrix in late 1965, proclaimed them \\"one of the best bands ever\\". Gleason's support raised the band's profile considerably, and within three months their manager Matthew Katz was fielding offers from recording companies, although they had yet to perform outside the Bay Area. Two significant early concerts featuring the Airplane were held in late 1965. The first was the historic dance at the Longshoremen's Hall in San Francisco on October 16, 1965, the first of many \\"happenings\\" in the Bay Area, where Gleason first saw them perform. At this concert they were supported by a local folk-rock group, the Great Society, which featured Grace Slick as lead singer and it was here that Kantner met Slick for the first time. A few weeks later, on November 6, they headlined a benefit concert for the San Francisco Mime Troupe, the first of many promotions by rising Bay Area entrepreneur Bill Graham, who later became the band's manager. In November 1965, Jefferson Airplane signed a recording contract with RCA Victor, which included a then unheard-of advance of US$25,000. Prior to this, they had recorded a demo for Columbia Records of \\"The Other Side Of This Life\\" with Bob Harvey on bass, which was immediately rejected by the label. On December 10, 1965, the Airplane played at the first Bill Graham-promoted show at the Fillmore Auditorium, supported by the Great Society and others. The Airplane also appeared at numerous Family Dog shows promoted by Chet Helms at the Avalon Ballroom. The group's first single was Balin's \\"It's No Secret\\" (a tune he wrote with Otis Redding in mind); the B-side was \\"Runnin' Round The World\\", the song that led to the band's first clash with RCA Victor over the lyric \\"The nights I've spent with you have been fantastic trips\\". After their debut LP was completed in March 1966, Skip Spence quit the band and he was eventually replaced by Spencer Dryden, who played his first show with the Airplane at the Berkeley Folk Festival on July 4, 1966. Dryden had previously played with a Los Angeles group called the Ashes, who later became the Peanut Butter Conspiracy. Original manager Matthew Katz was fired in August, sparking a long-running legal battle that continued until 1987, and Balin's friend and roommate Bill Thompson was installed as road manager and temporary band manager. It was Thompson, a friend and staunch supporter of the band and a former Chronicle staffer, who had convinced reviewers Ralph Gleason and John Wasserman to see the band at the Longshoreman's Hall. Thanks to Gleason's influence, Thompson was able to book the group for appearances at the Berkeley Folk Festival and at the Monterey Jazz Festival. The group's debut LP Jefferson Airplane Takes Off was released in September 1966. The folk-music-influenced album included John D. Loudermilk's \\"Tobacco Road\\" and Dino Valente's \\"Let's Get Together\\", as well as original ballads \\"It's No Secret\\" and \\"Come Up the Years\\". Despite the fact that the group had neither performed outside the Bay Area nor appeared on TV, the album garnered considerable attention in the United States and sold well enough to earn a gold record award. RCA Victor initially pressed only 15,000 copies, but it sold more than 10,000 in San Francisco alone, prompting the label to reprint it. For the re-pressing, the company deleted \\"Runnin' Round This World\\" (which had appeared on early mono pressings), because executives objected to the word \\"trip\\" in the lyrics. For similar reasons, RCA Victor substituted altered versions for two other tracks: \\"Let Me In\\", changing the line \\"I gotta get in/you know where\\" to \\"you shut your door/now it ain't fair.\\" In the same song, they also switched the lyric \\"Don't tell me you want money\\" to \\"Don't tell me it ain't funny\\". \\"Run Around\\" was also edited, changing the line \\"flowers that sway as you lay under me\\" to \\"flowers that sway as you stay here by me\\". The original pressings of the LP featuring \\"Runnin' 'Round This World\\" and the uncensored versions of \\"Let Me In\\" and \\"Run Around\\" are now worth thousands of dollars on the collectors' market. Signe Anderson gave birth to her daughter in May 1966, and in October she announced her departure from the band. Her final performance with the Airplane took place at the Fillmore on October 15, 1966. A recording of the performance was in 2010 released as a live album, subtitled Signe‚Äôs Farewell. =1966‚Äì1967: Commercial breakthrough= The following night, Anderson's replacement Grace Slick made her first appearance. Slick was already well known to the band‚Äîshe had attended the Airplane's debut gig at the Matrix in 1965 and her previous group, the Great Society, had often supported the Airplane in concert. Slick's recruitment proved pivotal to the Airplane's commercial breakthrough‚Äîshe possessed a powerful and supple contralto voice that complemented Balin's and was well-suited to the group's amplified psychedelic music, and, a former model, her good looks and stage presence greatly enhanced the group's live impact. \\"White Rabbit\\" was written by Grace Slick while she was still with The Great Society. The first album Slick recorded with Jefferson Airplane was Surrealistic Pillow, and Slick provided two songs from her previous group: her own \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody to Love\\", written by her brother-in-law Darby Slick. Both songs became breakout successes for Jefferson Airplane and have ever since been associated with that band. The Great Society had recorded an early version of \\"Somebody to Love\\" (under the title \\"Someone to Love\\") as the B-side of their only single, \\"Free Advice\\", produced by Sylvester Stewart (soon to become famous as Sly Stone). It reportedly took more than 50 takes to achieve a satisfactory rendition. The Great Society decided to split up in late 1966 and played its last show on September 11. Soon after, Slick was asked to join Jefferson Airplane by Jack Casady (whose musicianship was a major influence on her decision) and her Great Society contract was bought out for $750. In December 1966, Jefferson Airplane was featured in a Newsweek article about the booming San Francisco music scene, one of the first in a welter of similar media reports that prompted a massive influx of young people to the city and contributed to the commercialization of the hippie culture. Around the beginning of 1967 Bill Graham took over from Bill Thompson as manager. In January the group made their first visit to the East Coast. On January 14, alongside the Grateful Dead and Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane headlined the \\"Human Be-In\\", the famous all-day \\"happening\\" in Golden Gate Park, one of the key events leading up to the \\"Summer of Love\\". During this period the band gained their first international recognition when rising British pop star Donovan, who saw them during his stint on the U.S. West Coast in early 1966, mentioned the Airplane in his song \\"The Fat Angel\\", which subsequently appeared on his Sunshine Superman LP. The group's second LP, Surrealistic Pillow, recorded in Los Angeles with producer Rick Jarrard in only thirteen days at a cost of $8,000, launched the Airplane to international fame. Released in February 1967, the LP entered the Billboard 200 album chart on March 25 and remained there for over a year, peaking at No. 3\\\\. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The name \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" was suggested by the album's \\"shadow producer,\\" Jerry Garcia, when he mentioned that, as a whole, the album sounded \\"as surrealistic as a pillow is soft.\\" Although RCA would not acknowledge Garcia's considerable contributions to the album with a production credit, he is listed in the album's credits as \\"spiritual advisor.\\" In addition to the group's two best-known tracks, \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody to Love\\", the album featured \\"My Best Friend\\" by former drummer Skip Spence, Balin's driving blues-rock songs \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\" and \\"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\\", and the atmospheric Balin-Kantner ballad \\"Today\\". A reminder of their earlier folk incarnation was Kaukonen's solo acoustic guitar tour de force, \\"Embryonic Journey\\" (his first composition), which referenced contemporary acoustic guitar masters such as John Fahey and helped to establish the popular genre exemplified by acoustic guitarist Leo Kottke. The first single from the album, Spence's \\"My Best Friend\\", failed to chart, but the next two singles rocketed the group to prominence. Both \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\" became major U.S. hits, the former reaching No. 5 and the latter No. 8 on the Billboard singles chart. By late 1967 the Airplane were national and international stars and had become one of the hottest groups in America. Grace Slick biographer Barbara Rowes called the album \\"a declaration of independence from the establishment [-] What Airplane originated was a romanticism for the electronic age. Unlike the highly homogenized harmonies of the Beach Boys, Airplane never strived for a synthesis of its divergent sensibilities. Through [-] each song, there remain strains of the individual styles of the musicians [creating] unusual breadth and original interplay within each structure\\". This phase of the Airplane's career peaked with their famous performance at the Monterey International Pop Festival in June 1967. Monterey showcased leading bands from several major music \\"scenes\\" including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and the United Kingdom, and the resulting TV and film coverage gave national (and international) exposure to groups that had previously had only regional fame. Two songs from the Airplane's set were subsequently included in the D. A. Pennebaker film documentary of the event. In August 1967, the Airplane performed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, at two free outdoor concerts, along with fellow San Francisco Bay Area band The Grateful Dead. The first concert was held in downtown Montreal at Place Ville Marie, and the second was at the Youth Pavilion of Expo 67. The Airplane also benefited greatly from appearances on national network TV shows such as The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on NBC and The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS. The Airplane's famous appearance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour performing \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody to Love\\" was videotaped in color and augmented by developments in video techniques. It has been frequently re-screened and is notable for its pioneering use of the Chroma key process to simulate the Airplane's psychedelic light show. =1967‚Äì1970: Heavier sound and improvisation= After Surrealistic Pillow, the group's music underwent a significant transformation. Key influences on the group's new direction were the popularity and success of Jimi Hendrix and the British supergroup Cream, which prompted the Airplane (like many other groups) to adopt a \\"heavier\\" sound and to place a greater emphasis on improvisation. The band's third LP, After Bathing at Baxter's, was released on November 27, 1967, and eventually peaked in the charts at No. 17\\\\. Its famous cover, drawn by renowned artist and cartoonist Ron Cobb, depicts a Heath Robinson-inspired flying machine (constructed around an idealised version of a typical Haight-Ashbury district house) soaring above the chaos of American commercial culture. Recorded over a period of more than four months, with little input from nominal producer Al Schmitt, the new album demonstrated the group's growing engagement with psychedelic rock. Where the previous LP had consisted entirely of \\"standard-length\\" pop songs, Baxter's was dominated by long multi-part suites, while \\"A Small Package of Value Will Come To You Shortly\\" was a musique concr√®te-style audio collage. Baxter's also marked the ascendency of Kantner and Slick as the band's chief composers and the concurrent decline in the influence and involvement of founder Marty Balin. The other members, gravitating toward a harder-edged style, openly criticized Balin for his ballad-oriented compositions. Balin was also reportedly becoming increasingly disenchanted with the \\"star trips\\" and inflated egos generated by the band's runaway commercial success. Baxter's also marked the end of the Airplane's brief run of success on the singles chart. In contrast to \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody To Love\\", \\"The Ballad of You and Me and Pooneil\\" only peaked at No. 43 and \\"Watch Her Ride\\" stalled at No. 61\\\\. (Both singles reached the Top 40 in Cash Box.) None of the band's subsequent singles reached the Billboard Top 40 and several failed to chart at all. AM Top 40 radio became wary of a group that had scored a hit with a song that contained thinly veiled drug references and whose singles were often deemed too controversial, so Jefferson Airplane never again enjoyed the kind of widespread AM radio support that served as a prerequisite for Top Ten hits. In February 1968, manager Bill Graham was fired after Grace Slick delivered an \\"either he goes or I go\\" ultimatum. Bill Thompson took over as permanent manager and set about consolidating the group's financial security, establishing Icebag Corp. to oversee the band's publishing interests and purchasing a 20-room mansion at 2400 Fulton Street across from Golden Gate Park near the Haight-Ashbury, which became the band's office and communal residence. Bill Laudner was hired as road manager. In mid-1968, the group was photographed for a Life magazine story on \\"The New Rock\\", appearing on the cover of the June 28, 1968 edition. They undertook their first major tour of Europe in August‚ÄìSeptember 1968, playing alongside the Doors in the Netherlands, England, Germany, and Sweden. In a notorious incident at a concert in Amsterdam, while the Airplane was performing \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\", Doors singer Jim Morrison, under the influence of a combination of drugs fans had given him, appeared on stage and began dancing \\"like a pinwheel\\". As the group played faster and faster, Morrison spun around wildly until he finally fell senseless on the stage at Marty Balin's feet. Morrison was unable to perform his set with the Doors and was hospitalized while keyboardist Ray Manzarek was forced to sing all the vocals. It was also during this tour that Slick and Morrison allegedly engaged in a brief sexual relationship, described in Somebody To Love?, Slick's 1998 autobiography. Jefferson Airplane's fourth LP, Crown of Creation (released in September 1968), was a commercial success, peaking at No. 6 on the album chart. Grace Slick's \\"Lather\\", which opens the album, is said to be about her affair with drummer Spencer Dryden and his 30th birthday. \\"Triad\\", a David Crosby composition, had been rejected by The Byrds because they deemed its subject matter (a m√©nage √† trois) to be too \\"hot.\\" Slick's searing sexual and social-commentary anthem \\"Greasy Heart\\" was released as a single in March 1968. A few tracks recorded for the LP were left off the album but later included as bonus tracks, including the Grace Slick/Frank Zappa collaboration \\"Would You Like A Snack?\\" The Airplane's appearance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the fall of that year caused a minor stir when Grace Slick appeared in blackface (she claimed she simply wanted to wear all the makeup she saw in her dressing room) and raised her fist in the Black Panther Party's salute after singing \\"Crown of Creation\\". In November 1968, the band played \\"House at Pooneil Corners\\" on a New York City rooftop. It was filmed for D. A. Pennebaker movie 1 PM. The concert was stopped by the police just like the Beatles' famous rooftop concert about two months later, as depicted in the 1970 documentary Let It Be. In February 1969, RCA released the live album Bless Its Pointed Little Head, which was culled from 1968 performances at the Fillmore West on October 24‚Äì26 and the Fillmore East on November 28‚Äì30. It became the Airplane's fourth Top 20 album, peaking at No. 17\\\\. Hot Tuna began during a break in Jefferson Airplane's touring schedule in early 1969 while Grace Slick recovered from throat node surgery that left her unable to perform. Kaukonen, Casady, Kantner and drummer Joey Covington played several shows around San Francisco, including the Airplane's original club, The Matrix, before Jefferson Airplane resumed performing. Their early repertoire derived mainly from Airplane material that Kaukonen (the band's frontman) sang and covers of American country blues artists such as Reverend Gary Davis, Jelly Roll Morton, Bo Carter and Blind Blake. In addition, Casady and Kaukonen played as a duo under the moniker with Kaukonen on acoustic guitar and Casady on electric bass. From October 1969 to November 1970, Hot Tuna (also including Balin and, following Kantner's departure, a dedicated rhythm guitarist in their electric performances until November 1970) performed as the opening act to Jefferson Airplane with a combination of both electric and acoustic sets. In April 1969, sessions began for their next album, Volunteers, using new 16-track facilities at the Wally Heider Studio in San Francisco. This proved to be the last album by the \\"classic\\" lineup of the group. The album's release was delayed when the band ran into conflict with their label over the content of songs such as \\"We Can Be Together\\" and the planned title of the album, Volunteers of Amerika. \\"Volunteers of Amerika\\" is a corruption of the Volunteers of America charity, the term being in vogue in 1969 as an ironic expression of dissatisfaction with America; after the charity objected, the name was shortened to Volunteers. A few days after the band headlined at a free concert in New York's Central Park in August 1969, they performed in what Grace Slick characterized as the \\"morning maniac music\\" slot at the Woodstock Festival, for which the group was joined by noted British session keyboard player Nicky Hopkins. When interviewed about Woodstock by Jeff Tamarkin in 1992, Paul Kantner still recalled it with fondness, whereas Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden had less than rosy memories. Immediately after their Woodstock performance, the band appeared on The Dick Cavett Show and played a few songs. Other guests on that same episode were David Crosby, Stephen Stills, and Joni Mitchell. The new album was finally released in the United States in November 1969 with the title shortened to Volunteers. The album continued the Airplane's run of Top 20 LPs, peaking at No. 13 and attaining a RIAA gold certification early in 1970. It was their most political venture, showcasing the group's vocal opposition to the Vietnam War and documenting their reaction to the changing political atmosphere in the United States. The best-known tracks include \\"Volunteers,\\" \\"We Can Be Together,\\" \\"Good Shepherd,\\" and the post-apocalyptic \\"Wooden Ships,\\" which Paul Kantner co-wrote with David Crosby and Stephen Stills, and which Crosby, Stills & Nash also recorded on their debut album. RCA raised objections to the phrase \\"up against the wall, motherfucker\\" in the lyrics of Kantner's \\"We Can Be Together\\", but the group managed to prevent it from being censored on the album, pointing out that RCA had already allowed the offending word to be included on the cast album of the rock musical Hair. In addition, the song had the line \\"in order to survive, we steal, cheat, lie, forge, fuck, hide, and deal\\", which was also kept on the album (and which they sang on broadcast TV during their Dick Cavett appearance). For the single versions of \\"We Can Be Together,\\" \\"motherfucker\\" was changed to a long, drawn out \\"Ma,\\" and \\"fuck\\" was changed to \\"fred.\\" These edits were reflected in the printed lyrics that accompanied the album. In September 1969, Kaukonen and Casady played a week of acoustic-based concerts at the New Orleans House in Berkeley, California, as Hot Tuna; recordings culled from this engagement were released as the band's eponymous debut album in 1970. This initial Hot Tuna album was remarkably successful, reaching No. 30 on the U.S. album chart. Over the next two years, the various configurations of Hot Tuna began to occupy more and more of Casady's and Kaukonen's time, contributing to the growing divisions within Jefferson Airplane that came to a head in 1972. In December 1969, the Airplane played at the Altamont Free Concert at Altamont Speedway in California. Following the Grateful Dead's withdrawal from the program, they became the only band to perform at all three of the iconic rock festivals of the 1960s‚ÄîAltamont, Monterey Pop, and Woodstock. Headlined by The Rolling Stones, the concert was marred by violence. Marty Balin was knocked out during a scuffle with Hells Angels members who had been hired to act as \\"security.\\" The event became notorious for the fatal stabbing of black teenager Meredith Hunter in front of the stage by Hells Angels \\"guards\\" after he pulled out a revolver during the Stones' performance. This incident was the centerpiece of the documentary film Gimme Shelter. =1970‚Äì1974: Decline and dissolution= Spencer Dryden was dismissed from the band in February 1970 by a unanimous vote of the other members. He felt burned out by four years on the \\"acid merry-go-round\\" and was deeply disillusioned by the events of Altamont, which, he later recalled, \\"did not look like a bunch of happy hippies in streaming colors. It looked more like sepia-toned Hieronymus Bosch.\\" He took time off before returning to music the following year as Mickey Hart's replacement in the New Riders of the Purple Sage. Dryden was replaced by Hot Tuna drummer Joey Covington, who had already contributed additional percussion to Volunteers and performed select engagements with the Airplane as a touring second drummer in 1969. Later that year, the band was further augmented by the addition of veteran jazz violinist Papa John Creach, a friend of Covington who officially joined Hot Tuna and Jefferson Airplane for their fall tour in October 1970. Touring continued throughout 1970, but the group's only new recording that year was the single \\"Mexico\\" b/w \\"Have You Seen the Saucers?\\". Slick's \\"Mexico\\" was an attack on President Richard Nixon's Operation Intercept, which had been implemented to curtail the flow of marijuana into the United States. \\"Have You Seen the Saucers\\" marked the beginning of the science fiction themes that Kantner explored in much of his subsequent work, including Blows Against the Empire, his first solo album. Released in November 1970 and credited to \\"Paul Kantner/Jefferson Starship,\\" this prototypical iteration of Jefferson Starship (alternatively known as the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra) included David Crosby and Graham Nash; Grateful Dead members Jerry Garcia, Bill Kreutzmann, and Mickey Hart; session luminary Harvey Brooks; David Freiberg; and Slick, Covington and Casady. Blows Against the Empire peaked at No. 20 in the United States and was the first rock album nominated for the Hugo Award. Jefferson Airplane ended 1970 with their traditional Thanksgiving Day engagement at the Fillmore East (marking the final performances of the short- lived Creach-era septet) and the release of their first compilation album, The Worst of Jefferson Airplane, which continued their unbroken run of post-1967 chart success, reaching No. 12 on the Billboard album chart. 1971 was a year of major upheaval for Jefferson Airplane. Grace Slick and Paul Kantner had begun a relationship during 1970, and on January 25, 1971, their daughter China Wing Kantner (\\"Wing\\" was Slick's maiden name) was born. Slick's divorce from her first husband had come through shortly before this, but she and Kantner agreed that they did not wish to marry. In April 1971, Marty Balin officially left Jefferson Airplane after disassociating himself from the group following the fall 1970 tour. Although he had remained a key part of live performances after the band's creative direction shifted from the brooding love songs that he specialized in, the evolution of the polarized Kantner/Slick and Kaukonen/Casady cliques‚Äîcompounded by an emerging drinking problem‚Äîhad finally left him the odd man out. Following the traumatic death of Janis Joplin, he began to pursue a healthier lifestyle; Balin's study of yoga and abstention from drugs and alcohol further distanced him from the other members of the group, whose drug intake continued unabated. This further complicated the recording of their long-overdue follow-up to Volunteers; Balin had recently completed several new songs, including \\"Emergency\\" and the elongated R&B-infused; \\"You Wear Your Dresses Too Short,\\" both of which later appeared on archival releases. On May 13, 1971, Grace Slick was injured in a near-fatal automobile crash when her car slammed into a wall in a tunnel near the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The accident happened while she was drag racing with Jorma Kaukonen; both were driving at over 100 miles per hour, and Kaukonen claims that he \\"saved her life\\" by pulling her from the car. Slick's recuperation took a few months, forcing the Airplane to curtail their touring commitments. In the meantime, Slick recorded a comic song (\\"Never Argue with a German If You're Tired or European Song\\") about the incident for the new album. In September 1971, Bark was released. With cover art depicting a dead fish wrapped in an A&P-style; grocery bag, it was both the final album owed to RCA under the band's existing contract and the inaugural release on the band's Grunt Records vanity label. Manager Bill Thompson had struck a deal with RCA to allow Jefferson Airplane to run Grunt Records as they saw fit while retaining RCA's distribution. The single \\"Pretty As You Feel\\", excerpted from a longer jam with members of Santana and featuring lead vocals by Joey Covington, its principal composer, was the last Jefferson Airplane chart hit, peaking at No. 60 in Billboard and No. 35 in Cashbox. The album rose to No. 11 in Billboard, higher than Volunteers, Blows Against the Empire and Hot Tuna's second album, First Pull Up, Then Pull Down, released three months before Bark in June. In spite of the band's continued success, major creative and personal divisions persisted between the Slick/Kantner and Kaukonen/Casady factions. (Kaukonen's \\"Third Week In The Chelsea,\\" from Bark, chronicles the thoughts he was having about leaving the band.) These problems continued to be exacerbated by the band's escalating cocaine use and Slick's alcohol use disorder. Consequently, while the band played several dates in August in support of Bark (including two concerts in the New York metropolitan area and a show apiece in Detroit and Philadelphia), no tour was planned. Following a private concert/party commemorating the formation of Grunt Records at San Francisco's Friends and Relations Hall in September, the band would not reconvene until several Midwestern engagements in January 1972. Jefferson Airplane held together long enough to record one more album, entitled Long John Silver, begun in April 1972 and released in July. By this time the various members were thoroughly engaged with their various solo projects. Following the release of Kantner and Slick's Sunfighter in November 1971 and Creach's eponymous solo debut in December 1971, Hot Tuna released their first studio album and third opus (Burgers) in February 1972; meanwhile, Joey Covington immersed himself in various Grunt Records projects, including his own solo album (Fat Fandango, released in 1973) and the sessions for Black Kangaroo's debut album (led by multi-instrumentalist Peter Kaukonen, Jorma's younger brother). However, Covington was either dismissed from the band or left of his own volition shortly after the sessions commenced. With Hot Tuna drummer Sammy Piazza deputizing on one track, Covington (who had already recorded two drum parts) was soon replaced by former Turtles/CSNY drummer John Barbata, who ultimately played on most of the album. Long John Silver is notable for its cover, which folded out into a humidor, which the inner photo depicted as storing cigars (which may have been filled with marijuana). Despite middling reviews, the album rose to No. 20 in the United States, a significantly higher placement than Burgers (No. 68) or Sunfighter (No. 89). The band began a proper national tour to promote Long John Silver in the summer of 1972, their first in nearly two years. Shortly before the tour commenced, David Freiberg (who had recently completed a prison sentence for marijuana possession after leaving Quicksilver Messenger Service) joined as a belated replacement for Balin. The East Coast leg of the tour included a major free concert in Central Park that drew over 50,000 attendees. They returned to the West Coast in September, playing concerts in San Diego, Hollywood, Phoenix and Albuquerque. The tour culminated in two shows at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco (September 21‚Äì22), both of which were recorded. At the end of the second show, the group was joined on stage by Marty Balin, who sang lead vocals on \\"Volunteers\\" and the final song, \\"You Wear Your Dresses Too Short.\\" The Winterland shows were the last live performances by Jefferson Airplane[22] until their reunion in 1989. A new live album, Thirty Seconds Over Winterland, was culled from the tour and released in April 1973. Later that year, Kaukonen and Casady decided to focus on Hot Tuna as a full-time endeavor, effectively leaving the band; however, no official announcement was ever released. By December 1973, RCA had terminated the band's salaries, resulting in Freiberg being forced to draw unemployment to maintain his house payments. Following the commercially unsuccessful Baron von Tollbooth & the Chrome Nun (1973; credited to Kantner, Slick and Freiberg) and Manhole (1974; credited to Slick), Jefferson Airplane evolved into Jefferson Starship in January 1974. The initial lineup consisted of the remaining members of Jefferson Airplane (Kantner, Slick, Freiberg, Barbata, Creach); bassist Peter Kaukonen (soon replaced by British multi-instrumentalist Pete Sears, a veteran of Creach's debut solo album and Manhole); and lead guitarist Craig Chaquico, a member of Grunt Records band Jack Traylor and Steelwind who contributed to the Kantner/Slick solo albums beginning with Sunfighter. They appropriated the name from Kantner's Blows Against the Empire, with Bill Thompson convincing the group that maintaining the connection was prudent from a business standpoint. Reflecting the transition, the album Dragon Fly, released in September 1974, was credited to Slick, Kantner and Jefferson Starship. =Side projects and spin-off bands= =Reunion and recent events= After the acrimonious events that resulted in Jefferson Starship's 1984 evolution into Starship, Kantner reunited with Balin (who joined Jefferson Starship in January 1975 following a guest appearance on Dragon Fly before leaving once more in 1978) and Jack Casady in 1985 to form the KBC Band. They released their only album, KBC Band, in 1987 on Arista Records. On March 4, 1988, Grace Slick made a cameo appearance during a Hot Tuna San Francisco performance at the Fillmore (with Kantner and Creach joining in), facilitating a potential reunion of Jefferson Airplane. In 1989, the classic 1966-1970 lineup of Jefferson Airplane reunited (with the exception of drummer Spencer Dryden) for a tour and album. The self-titled album was released by Epic to modest sales but the accompanying tour was considered a success. In 1996, the 1966-1970 lineup of Jefferson Airplane was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Balin, Casady, Dryden, Kantner and Kaukonen attending as well as performing. Grace Slick was absent, as she was unable to travel for medical reasons. 1998 saw the production and broadcast of a very popular episode of the hit VH1 documentary television series Behind The Music about Jefferson Airplane, directed by Bob Sarles. Band members Grace Slick, Marty Balin, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Casady and Spencer Dryden were all interviewed for the episode, along with David Crosby, longtime Airplane manager Bill Thompson and China Kantner, daughter of Paul Kantner and Grace Slick. In 2004, the film Fly Jefferson Airplane (directed by Bob Sarles) was released on DVD. It covers the years 1965‚Äì1972 and includes then-recent interviews with band members and thirteen complete songs. Spencer Dryden died of colon cancer on January 11, 2005. Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady performed a set at the 2015 Lockn' Festival to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jefferson Airplane. They were joined by G.E. Smith, Rachael Price, Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams. In 2016, Jefferson Airplane was given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Both Signe Anderson and Paul Kantner died on January 28, 2016. Marty Balin died on September 27, 2018.

Built in the 12th century and demolished in 1904, the prison was extended and rebuilt many times, and remained in use for over 700 years, from 1188 to 1902. For much of its history, a succession of criminal courtrooms were attached to the prison, commonly referred to as the \\"Old Bailey\\". The present Old Bailey (officially, Central Criminal Court) now occupies much of the site of the prison. History Newgate, the old city gate and prison In the early 12th century, Henry II instituted legal reforms that gave the Crown more control over the administration of justice. As part of his Assize of Clarendon of 1166, he required the construction of prisons, where the accused would stay while royal judges debated their innocence or guilt and subsequent punishment. In 1188, Newgate was the first institution established to meet that purpose. A few decades later in 1236, in an effort to significantly enlarge the prison, the king converted one of the Newgate turrets, which still functioned as a main gate into the city, into an extension of the prison. The addition included new dungeons and adjacent buildings, which would remain unaltered for roughly two centuries. By the 15th century, however, Newgate was in need of repair. Following pressure from reformers who learned that the women's quarters were too small and did not contain their own latrines ‚Äì obliging women to walk through the men's quarters to reach one ‚Äì officials added a separate tower and chamber for female prisoners in 1406. Some Londoners bequeathed their estates to repair the prison. The building was collapsing and decaying, and many prisoners were dying from the close quarters, overcrowding, rampant disease, and bad sanitary conditions. Indeed, one year, 22 prisoners died from \\"gaol fever\\". The situation in Newgate was so dire that in 1419, city officials temporarily shut down the prison. The executors of Lord Mayor Dick Whittington were granted a licence to renovate the prison in 1422. The gate and gaol were pulled down and rebuilt. There was a new central hall for meals, a new chapel, and the creation of additional chambers and basement cells with no light or ventilation. There were three main wards: the Master‚Äôs side for those could afford to pay for their own food and accommodations, the Common side for those who were too poor, and a Press Yard for special prisoners. The king often used Newgate as a holding place for heretics, traitors, and rebellious subjects brought to London for trial. The prison housed both male and female felons and debtors. Prisoners were separated into wards by gender. By the mid-15th century, Newgate could accommodate roughly 300 prisoners. Though the prisoners lived in separate quarters, they mixed freely with each other and visitors to the prison. The prison was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, and was rebuilt in 1672 by Sir Christopher Wren. His design extended the complex into new buildings on the south side of the street. Elevation and plan of Newgate Prison published in 1800 In 1770, construction was begun to enlarge the prison and add a new sessions house. Parliament granted ¬£50,000 towards the cost, and the City of London provided land measuring by . The work followed the designs of George Dance. The new prison was constructed to an architecture terrible design intended to discourage law-breaking. The building was laid out around a central courtyard, and was divided into two sections: a \\"Common\\" area for poor prisoners and a \\"State area\\" for those able to afford more comfortable accommodation. Each section was further sub-divided to accommodate felons and debtors. Construction of the second Newgate Prison was almost finished when it was stormed by a mob during the Gordon riots in June 1780. The building was gutted by fire, and the walls were badly damaged; the cost of repairs was estimated at ¬£30,000. Dance's new prison was finally completed in 1782. During the early 19th century the prison attracted the attention of the social reformer Elizabeth Fry. She was particularly concerned at the conditions in which female prisoners (and their children) were held. After she presented evidence to the House of Commons improvements were made. In 1858, the interior was rebuilt with individual cells. The prison closed in 1902, and was demolished in 1904.  Prison life  Newgate exercise yard, 1872, by Gustave Dor√© All manner of criminals stayed at Newgate. Some committed acts of petty crime and theft, breaking and entering homes or committing highway robberies, while others performed serious crimes such as rapes and murders. The number of prisoners in Newgate for specific types of crime often grew and fell, reflecting public anxieties of the time. For example, towards the tail end of Edward I's reign, there was a rise in street robberies. As such, the punishment for drawing out a dagger was 15 days in Newgate; injuring someone meant 40 days in the prison. Upon their arrival in Newgate, prisoners were chained and led to the appropriate dungeon for their crime. Those who had been sentenced to death stayed in a cellar beneath the keeper‚Äôs house, essentially an open sewer lined with chains and shackles to encourage submission. Otherwise, common debtors were sent to the \\"stone hall\\" whereas common felons were taken to the \\"stone hold\\". The dungeons were dirty and unlit, so depraved that physicians would not enter. The conditions did not improve with time. Prisoners who could afford to purchase alcohol from the prisoner-run drinking cellar by the main entrance to Newgate remained perpetually drunk. There were lice everywhere, and jailers left the prisoners chained to the wall to languish and starve. The legend of the \\"Black Dog\\", an emaciated spirit thought to represent the brutal treatment of prisoners, only served to emphasize the harsh conditions. From 1315 to 1316, 62 deaths in Newgate were under investigation by the coroner, and prisoners were always desperate to leave the prison. The cruel treatment from guards did nothing to help the unfortunate prisoners. According to medieval statute, the prison was to be managed by two annually elected sheriffs, who in turn would sublet the administration of the prison to private \\"gaolers\\", or \\"keepers\\", for a price. These keepers in turn were permitted to exact payment directly from the inmates, making the position one of the most profitable in London. Inevitably, often the system offered incentives for the keepers to exhibit cruelty to the prisoners, charging them for everything from entering the gaol to having their chains both put on and taken off. They often began inflicting punishment on prisoners before their sentences even began. Guards, whose incomes partially depended on extorting their wards, charged the prisoners for food, bedding, and to be released from their shackles. To earn additional money, guards blackmailed and tortured prisoners. Among the most notorious Keepers in the Middle Ages were the 14th-century gaolers Edmund Lorimer, who was infamous for charging inmates four times the legal limit for the removal of irons, and Hugh De Croydon, who was eventually convicted of blackmailing prisoners in his care. Indeed, the list of things that prison guards were not allowed to do serve as a better indication of the conditions in Newgate than the list of things that they were allowed to do. Gaolers were not allowed to take alms intended for prisoners. They could not monopolize the sale of food, charge excessive fees for beds, or demand fees for bringing prisoners to the Old Bailey. In 1393, new regulation was added to prevent gaolers from charging for lamps or beds. Not a half century later, in 1431, city administrators met to discuss other potential areas of reform. Proposed regulations included separating freemen and freewomen into the north and south chambers, respectively, and keeping the rest of the prisoners in underground holding cells. Good prisoners who had not been accused of serious crimes would be allowed to use the chapel and recreation rooms at no additional fees. Meanwhile, debtors whose burden did not meet a minimum threshold would not be required to wear shackles. Prison officials were barred from selling food, charcoal, and candles. The prison was supposed to have yearly inspections, but whether they actually occurred is unknown. Other reforms attempted to reduce the waiting time between jail deliveries to the Old Bailey, with the aim of reducing suffering, but these efforts had little effect. Over the centuries, Newgate was used for a number of purposes including imprisoning people awaiting execution, although it was not always secure: burglar Jack Sheppard twice escaped from the prison before he went to the gallows at Tyburn in 1724. Prison chaplain Paul Lorrain achieved some fame in the early 18th century for his sometimes dubious publication of Confessions of the condemned. Executions Execution by hanging, outside Newgate, early 1800s In 1783, the site of London's gallows was moved from Tyburn to Newgate. Public executions outside the prison ‚Äì by this time, London's main prison ‚Äì continued to draw large crowds. It was also possible to visit the prison by obtaining a permit from the Lord Mayor of the City of London or a sheriff. The condemned were kept in narrow, sombre cells separated from Newgate Street by a thick wall and received only a dim light from the inner courtyard. The gallows were constructed outside a door in Newgate Street for public viewing. Dense crowds of thousands of spectators could pack the streets to see these events, and in 1807 dozens died at a public execution when part of the crowd of 40,000 spectators collapsed into a human crush. From 1868, public executions were discontinued and executions were carried out on gallows inside Newgate, initially using the same mobile gallows in the Chapel Yard, but later in a shed built near the same spot. Dead Man's Walk was a long stone-flagged passageway, partly open to the sky and roofed with iron mesh (thus also known as Birdcage Walk). Executed criminals were buried beneath its flagstones and their initials engraved into the stone wall above. Online photographs of a passageway of brick arches within the Old Bailey site purporting to be Dead Man's Walk are not: it was demolished when Newgate was demolished in 1904. Until the 20th century, future British executioners were trained at Newgate. One of the last was John Ellis, who began training in 1901. In total ‚Äì publicly or otherwise ‚Äì 1,169 people were executed at the prison. In November 1835 James Pratt and John Smith were the last two men to be executed for sodomy. Michael Barrett was the last man to be hanged in public outside Newgate Prison (and the last person to be publicly executed in Great Britain) on 26 May 1868.

The original iron gate leading to the gallows was used for decades in an alleyway in Buffalo, New York, USA. It is currently housed in that city at Canisius College. The original door from a prison cell used to house St. Oliver Plunkett in 1681 is on display at St. Peter's Church in Drogheda, Ireland. The phrase \\"[as] black as Newgate's knocker\\" is a Cockney reference to the door knocker on the front of the prison. =In literature= From 1698‚Äì1719, gallows confessions of execution were published and sold by the chaplain Paul Lorrain who received thereby many times his salary. Later described ‚Äúa rather sanctimonious prig\\", \\"addicted to piety\\"; Lorrain wrote Confessions less authentic than \\"gutter press\\". A record of executions conducted at the prison, together with commentary, was published as The Newgate Calendar. This inspired a genre of Victorian literature known as the Newgate novel. The prison appears in a number of works by Charles Dickens. Novels include Oliver Twist, A Tale of Two Cities, Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty and Great Expectations. Newgate prison was also the subject of an entire essay in his work Sketches by Boz. The prison is also depicted in: * Geoffrey Chaucer's anthology The Canterbury Tales (The Cook's Tale) * Daniel Defoe's novel Moll Flanders * William Godwin's novel Caleb Williams * Michael Crichton's novel The Great Train Robbery * Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle * Leon Garfield's novel Smith * Joseph O'Connor's novel Star of the Sea ‚Äì where one section concerns a character's imprisonment and subsequent escape from Newgate * Louis L'Amour's novel To The Far Blue Mountains ‚Äì where the main character Barnabas Sackett is first imprisoned and later escapes from Newgate * Bernard Cornwell's novel Gallows Thief * David Liss's novel A Conspiracy of Paper, and its sequel, A Spectacle of Corruption * Richard Zacks's novel The Pirate Hunter (The True Story of Captain Kidd) * George MacDonald Fraser's novel Flashman's Lady * Jonathan Barnes' The Somnambulist * Marguerite Henry's novel King of the Wind * C.

Toronto:Royal Ontario Museum, p. 79. bethroot, or stinking Benjamin.Stinking Benjamin: A trillium that by any other name would smell so sweet , adirondack almanack, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. The plant takes its common name \\"wake robin\\" by analogy with the European robin, which has a red breast heralding spring. Likewise Trillium erectum is a spring ephemeral whose life-cycle is synchronized with that of the forests in which it lives. It is native to the eastern United States and eastern Canada from northern Georgia to Quebec and New Brunswick. Composite image showing both red and white color morphs of the flower of Trillium erectum. Note that both morphs have a dark purple gynoecium with contrasting anthers Red trillium close up, showing detail of ovary and stamens Description Trillium erectum is a perennial herbaceous plant that grows to about in height with a spread of . It can tolerate extreme cold in winter, surviving temperatures down to . Like all trilliums, its parts are in groups of three, with a 3-petalled flower above a whorl of pointed triple leaves. The petals are usually dark reddish maroon to purplish, fading to purple with age, but petal color is variable with yellow, pale green, pink, or white petals occurring occasionally throughout the range of the species. The ovary is dark purple to maroon regardless of petal color. The carrion-scented flowers attract scavenging flies for pollination. Eventually the flower petals wither, leaving behind a fruit that ripens to a dark red berry-like capsule, 1 to 1.5 centimeters long. =Species Complex= Trillium erectum shares many anatomical details with other North American Trillium species. These species hybridize in the wild, which has led some researchers to group them into a species complex, specifically, a syngameon of semispecies. The combinations of traits that are supposed to differentiate members of the complex from one another are sometimes inconsistently combined in wild populations. This has led some researchers to declare the individual species invalid, and refer to the species complex collectively as T. erectum (sensu lato). Others acknowledge the existence of introgression and hybrid swarm formation between some or all complex members, but maintain that the named species within the complex represent convenient groups with common features. Members of the T. erectum complex have flowers with the following commonalities: (1) petals that are coarse and stiff in texture (in contrast with the wavy edges of other species), (2) petals that do not change color after pollination, (3) petals with prominent, netted veins, (4) fleshy stigmas that are attached to the ovary separately, without a common style, and (5) conspicuous, deeply-ridged ovaries. North American members of the T. erectum species complex: * T. cernuum * T. erectum * T. flexipes * T. rugelii * T. simile * T. sulcatum * T. vaseyi The Asian species T. camschatcense, resembles the North American T. flexipes very closely, and itself has close relatives with similar floral features. However, trillium speciation in this group of Asian species is characterized by differences in chromosome number, with hybrids more definitively distinguishable from parent species by karyotype. * T. apetalon * T. camschatcense * T. channellii * T. √ó hagae * T. smallii * T. tschonoskii =Varieties= Two infraspecific names are accepted: * Trillium erectum var. album (Michx.) Pursh * Trillium erectum var. erectum T. erectum var. album has white petals. All other petal colors (including yellow) constitute the nominate variety (var. erectum). Variety album occurs occasionally throughout the range of the species. At elevations less than in western North Carolina and other areas surrounding the Great Smoky Mountains, the white-flowered variety of T. erectum predominates. Cultivation Trillium erectum is cultivated as a flowering ornamental plant. It has received the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society.  Medicinal uses  The root was traditionally used as an aid in childbirth, hence the name \\"Beth root\\" (a corruption of \\"birth root\\"). Native Americans used root tea for menstrual disorders, to induce childbirth, and to aid in labor. The leaves contain calcium oxalate crystals and crystal raphide, and should not be consumed by humans.

This mass grave is located in Est√©par, a small town in Northern Spain. The excavation occurred in July‚ÄìAugust 2014. Mass murder is the act of murdering a number of people, typically simultaneously or over a relatively short period of time and in close geographic proximity. The FBI defines mass murder as murdering four or more people during an event with no \\"cooling-off period\\" between the murders. A mass murder typically occurs in a single location where one or more people kill several others.Clues to Mass Rampage Killers: Deep Backstage, Hidden Arsenal, Clandestine Excitement, Randall Collins, The Sociological Eye, September 1, 2012 A mass murder may be committed by individuals or organizations whereas a spree killing is committed by one or two individuals. Mass murderers differ from spree killers, who kill at two or more locations with almost no time break between murders and are not defined by the number of victims, and serial killers, who may kill people over long periods of time. By terrorist organizations Many terrorist groups in recent times have used the tactic of killing many victims to fulfill their political aims. Such incidents have included the: * Murder of 241 American and 58 French soldiers in the Beirut barracks bombings on October 23, 1983 by the Islamic Jihad Organization * Ba≈übaƒülar attack in which 33 civilians were killed by the PKK on July 5, 1993 * 19 American airmen murdered in the Khobar Towers bombing on June 2, 1996 by Hezbollah Al-Hejaz * September 11 attacks on September 11, 2001 by Al-Qaeda that killed 2,977 victims * 193 murdered during the 2004 Madrid train bombings on March 11, 2004 by Al-Qaeda * 334 murdered, including 186 children in the Beslan school siege on September 1‚Äì4, 2004 by Riyad-us Saliheen * 52 murdered in the 2005 London bombings on July 7, 2005 by Islamic terrorists * Killing of 166 people in the Mumbai attacks on November 26‚Äì29, 2008 by Lashkar-e-Taiba * 130 deaths resulting from the November 2015 Paris attacks on November 13‚Äì14, 2015 by ISIS * 86 murdered in the 2016 Nice truck attack on July 14, 2016 by ISIS By cults Certain cults, especially religious cults, have committed a number of mass killings and mass murder- suicides. These include Jim Jones' Peoples Temple in Jonestown, Guyana, where 919 people died in 1978; the Order of the Solar Temple in Canada, Switzerland, and France, where 75 died in 1994, 1995, and 1997; Shoko Asahara's Aum Shinrikyo, which killed 12 in Tokyo, Japan, in 1995; Marshall Applewhite's Heaven's Gate in San Diego, California, where 39 died in 1997; and the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God in Uganda, where 778 died in 2000.  By individuals  The funeral for sextuple axe murder victims in Huittinen, Finland in 1943, committed by Toivo Koljonen Mass murderers may fall into any of a number of categories, including killers of family, of coworkers, of students, and of random strangers. Their motives for murder vary. A notable motivation for mass murder is revenge, but other motivations are possible, including the need for attention or fame. Acting on the orders of Joseph Stalin, Vasili Blokhin's war crime killing of 7,000 Polish prisoners of war, shot in 28 days, is notable as one of the most organized and protracted mass murders by a single individual on record. = Law enforcement response and countermeasures = Analysis of the Columbine High School massacre and other incidents where law enforcement officers waited for backup has resulted in changed recommendations regarding what victims, bystanders, and law enforcement officers should do. In the Columbine shooting, the perpetrators, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, were able to murder 13 people, then commit suicide before the first SWAT team even entered the school. Average response time by law enforcement to a mass shooting is typically much longer than the time the shooter is engaged in killing. While immediate action may be extremely dangerous, it may save lives which would be lost if victims and bystanders involved in the situation remain passive, or law enforcement response is delayed until overwhelming force can be deployed. It is recommended that victims and bystanders involved in the incident take active steps to flee, hide, or fight the shooter and that law enforcement officers present or first arriving at the scene attempt immediately to engage the shooter. In many instances, immediate action by victims, bystanders, or law enforcement officers has saved lives. Criticism of the analytical category \\"mass murder\\" Commentators have pointed out that there are a wide variety of ways that homicides with more than several victims might be classified. Such incidents can be, and have been even in recent decades, classified many different ways including \\"as a mass shooting; as a school shooting; as mass murder; as workplace violence...; as a crime involving an assault rifle; as a case of a mentally ill person committing acts of violence; and so on.\\" How such rarely occurring incidents of homicide are classified tends to change significantly with time. \\"In the 1960s and 1970s,... it was understood that the key feature of [a number of such] cases was a high body count. These early discussions of mass murder lumped together [a variety of] cases that varied along what would come to be seen as important dimensions: * Time: Did the killings occur more or less simultaneously, or did they extend over several days, months, or years? * Place: Did the killings occur in a single location, or in a variety of places? * Method: How were the victims killed?\\" In the late decades of the twentieth century and early years of the 2000s, the most popular classifications moved to include method, time and place. While such classifications may assist in gaining human meaning, as human-selected categories, they can also carry significant meaning and reflect a particular point of view of the commentator who assigned the descriptor.

In topology and mathematics in general, the boundary of a subset S of a topological space X is the set of points which can be approached both from S and from the outside of S. More precisely, it is the set of points in the closure of S not belonging to the interior of S. An element of the boundary of S is called a boundary point of S. The term boundary operation refers to finding or taking the boundary of a set. Notations used for boundary of a set S include bd(S), fr(S), and \\\\partial S. Some authors (for example Willard, in General Topology) use the term frontier instead of boundary in an attempt to avoid confusion with a different definition used in algebraic topology and the theory of manifolds. Despite widespread acceptance of the meaning of the terms boundary and frontier, they have sometimes been used to refer to other sets. For example, the term frontier has been used to describe the residue of S, namely S \\\\ S (the set of boundary points not in S). Felix Hausdorff Reprinted by Chelsea in 1949. named the intersection of S with its boundary the border of S (the term boundary is used to refer to this set in Metric Spaces by E. T. Copson). A connected component of the boundary of S is called a boundary component of S.  Common definitions  There are several equivalent definitions for the boundary of a subset S of a topological space X: *the closure of S minus the interior of S: \\\\partial S := \\\\bar{S} \\\\setminus S^\\\\circ *the intersection of the closure of S with the closure of its complement: \\\\partial S := \\\\overline{S} \\\\cap \\\\overline{(X \\\\setminus S)} *the set of points p \\\\in X such that every neighborhood of p contains at least one point of S and at least one point not of S: \\\\partial S := \\\\\\\\{ p \\\\in X \\\\mid \\\\forall O i p: O\\\\cap S eq \\\\emptyset \\\\,\\\\text{ and }\\\\, O \\\\cap S^c eq \\\\emptyset \\\\\\\\}  Examples  Boundary of hyperbolic components of Mandelbrot set Consider the real line \\\\R with the usual topology (i.e. the topology whose basis sets are open intervals) and \\\\Q, the subset of rationals (with empty interior). One has * \\\\partial (0,5) = \\\\partial [0,5) = \\\\partial (0,5] = \\\\partial [0,5]=\\\\\\\\{0,5\\\\\\\\} * \\\\partial \\\\varnothing= \\\\varnothing * \\\\partial \\\\Q = \\\\R * \\\\partial (\\\\Q \\\\cap [0, 1]) = [0, 1] These last two examples illustrate the fact that the boundary of a dense set with empty interior is its closure. In the space of rational numbers with the usual topology (the subspace topology of \\\\R), the boundary of (-\\\\infty, a), where a is irrational, is empty. The boundary of a set is a topological notion and may change if one changes the topology. For example, given the usual topology on \\\\R^2, the boundary of a closed disk \\\\Omega = \\\\\\\\{(x,y) x^2+y^2 \\\\leq 1 \\\\\\\\} is the disk's surrounding circle: \\\\partial \\\\Omega = \\\\\\\\{(x,y)x^2+y^2=1\\\\\\\\}. If the disk is viewed as a set in \\\\R^3 with its own usual topology, i.e. \\\\Omega = \\\\\\\\{(x,y, 0) x^2+y^2 \\\\leq 1 \\\\\\\\}, then the boundary of the disk is the disk itself: \\\\partial \\\\Omega = \\\\Omega. If the disk is viewed as its own topological space (with the subspace topology of \\\\R^2), then the boundary of the disk is empty. Properties * The boundary of a set is closed. * The boundary of the interior of a set as well as the boundary of the closure of a set are both contained in the boundary of the set. * A set is the boundary of some open set if and only if it is closed and nowhere dense. * The boundary of a set is the boundary of the complement of the set: \\\\partial S = \\\\partial(S^C). * The interior of the boundary of a closed set is the empty set. Hence: * p is a boundary point of a set if and only if every neighborhood of p contains at least one point in the set and at least one point not in the set. * A set is closed if and only if it contains its boundary, and open if and only if it is disjoint from its boundary. * The closure of a set equals the union of the set with its boundary: \\\\overline{S} = S \\\\cup \\\\partial S. * The boundary of a set is empty if and only if the set is both closed and open (that is, a clopen set). * The interior of the boundary of the closure of a set is the empty set. ::::File:Accumulation And Boundary Points Of S.PNG :Conceptual Venn diagram showing the relationships among different points of a subset S of Rn. A = set of limit points of S, B = set of boundary points of S, area shaded green = set of interior points of S, area shaded yellow = set of isolated points of S, areas shaded black = empty sets. Every point of S is either an interior point or a boundary point. Also, every point of S is either an accumulation point or an isolated point. Likewise, every boundary point of S is either an accumulation point or an isolated point. Isolated points are always boundary points.  Boundary of a boundary  For any set S, ‚àÇS ‚äá ‚àÇ‚àÇS, with equality holding if and only if the boundary of S has no interior points, which will be the case for example if S is either closed or open. Since the boundary of a set is closed, ‚àÇ‚àÇS = ‚àÇ‚àÇ‚àÇS for any set S. The boundary operator thus satisfies a weakened kind of idempotence. In discussing boundaries of manifolds or simplexes and their simplicial complexes, one often meets the assertion that the boundary of the boundary is always empty. Indeed, the construction of the singular homology rests critically on this fact. The explanation for the apparent incongruity is that the topological boundary (the subject of this article) is a slightly different concept from the boundary of a manifold or of a simplicial complex. For example, the boundary of an open disk viewed as a manifold is empty, as is its topological boundary viewed as a subset of itself, while its topological boundary viewed as a subset of the real plane is the circle surrounding the disk. Conversely, the boundary of a closed disk viewed as a manifold is the bounding circle, as is its topological boundary viewed as a subset of the real plane, while its topological boundary viewed as a subset of itself is empty. (In particular, the topological boundary depends on the ambient space, while the boundary of a manifold is invariant.)

It expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk, and it provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function. Cauchy's formula shows that, in complex analysis, \\"differentiation is equivalent to integration\\": complex differentiation, like integration, behaves well under uniform limits ‚Äì a result that does not hold in real analysis.

In particular is actually infinitely differentiable, with :f^{(n)}(a) = \\\\frac{n!}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\oint_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(z)}{\\\\left(z-a\\\\right)^{n+1}}\\\\, dz. This formula is sometimes referred to as Cauchy's differentiation formula. The theorem stated above can be generalized. The circle can be replaced by any closed rectifiable curve in which has winding number one about . Moreover, as for the Cauchy integral theorem, it is sufficient to require that be holomorphic in the open region enclosed by the path and continuous on its closure. Note that not every continuous function on the boundary can be used to produce a function inside the boundary that fits the given boundary function. For instance, if we put the function , defined for ,into the Cauchy integral formula, we get zero for all points inside the circle. In fact, giving just the real part on the boundary of a holomorphic function is enough to determine the function up to an imaginary constant ‚Äî there is only one imaginary part on the boundary that corresponds to the given real part, up to addition of a constant. We can use a combination of a M√∂bius transformation and the Stieltjes inversion formula to construct the holomorphic function from the real part on the boundary. For example, the function has real part . On the unit circle this can be written . Using the M√∂bius transformation and the Stieltjes formula we construct the function inside the circle. The term makes no contribution, and we find the function . This has the correct real part on the boundary, and also gives us the corresponding imaginary part, but off by a constant, namely .  Proof sketch  By using the Cauchy integral theorem, one can show that the integral over (or the closed rectifiable curve) is equal to the same integral taken over an arbitrarily small circle around . Since is continuous, we can choose a circle small enough on which is arbitrarily close to . On the other hand, the integral :\\\\oint_C \\\\frac{1}{z-a} \\\\,dz = 2 \\\\pi i, over any circle centered at . This can be calculated directly via a parametrization (integration by substitution) where and is the radius of the circle. Letting gives the desired estimate : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left  \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi i} \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{f(z)}{z-a} \\\\,dz - f(a) \\\\right  &= \\\\left  \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi i} \\\\oint_C \\\\frac{f(z)-f(a)}{z-a} \\\\,dz \\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[.5em] &= \\\\left  \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}\\\\left(\\\\frac{f\\\\bigl(z(t)\\\\bigr)-f(a)}{\\\\varepsilon e^{it}}\\\\cdot\\\\varepsilon e^{it}i\\\\right )\\\\,dt\\\\right \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\frac{ f\\\\bigl(z(t)\\\\bigr) - f(a) } {\\\\varepsilon} \\\\,\\\\varepsilon\\\\,dt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[.5em] &\\\\leq \\\\max_{z-a=\\\\varepsilon}f(z) - f(a) \\\\xrightarrow[\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0]{} 0. \\\\end{align}  Example  Surface of the real part of the function and its singularities, with the contours described in the text. Let :g(z)=\\\\frac{z^2}{z^2+2z+2}, and let be the contour described by (the circle of radius 2). To find the integral of around the contour , we need to know the singularities of . Observe that we can rewrite as follows: :g(z)=\\\\frac{z^2}{(z-z_1)(z-z_2)} where and . Thus, has poles at and . The moduli of these points are less than 2 and thus lie inside the contour. This integral can be split into two smaller integrals by Cauchy‚ÄìGoursat theorem; that is, we can express the integral around the contour as the sum of the integral around and where the contour is a small circle around each pole. Call these contours around and around . Now, each of these smaller integrals can be solved by the Cauchy integral formula, but they first must be rewritten to apply the theorem. For the integral around , define as . This is analytic (since the contour does not contain the other singularity). We can simplify to be: :f_1(z)=\\\\frac{z^2}{z-z_2} and now :g(z)=\\\\frac{f_1(z)}{z-z_1}. Since the Cauchy integral theorem says that: :\\\\oint_C \\\\frac{f_1(z)}{z-a}\\\\, dz=2\\\\pi i\\\\cdot f_1(a), we can evaluate the integral as follows: : \\\\oint_{C_1} g(z)\\\\,dz =\\\\oint_{C_1} \\\\frac{f_1(z)}{z-z_1}\\\\,dz =2\\\\pi i\\\\frac{z_1^2}{z_1-z_2}. Doing likewise for the other contour: :f_2(z)=\\\\frac{z^2}{z-z_1}, we evaluate : \\\\oint_{C_2} g(z)\\\\,dz =\\\\oint_{C_2} \\\\frac{f_2(z)}{z-z_2}\\\\,dz =2\\\\pi i\\\\frac{z_2^2}{z_2-z_1}. The integral around the original contour then is the sum of these two integrals: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\oint_C g(z)\\\\,dz &{}= \\\\oint_{C_1} g(z)\\\\,dz \\\\+ \\\\oint_{C_2} g(z)\\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[.5em] &{}= 2\\\\pi i\\\\left(\\\\frac{z_1^2}{z_1-z_2}+\\\\frac{z_2^2}{z_2-z_1}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[.5em] &{}= 2\\\\pi i(-2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[.3em] &{}=-4\\\\pi i. \\\\end{align} An elementary trick using partial fraction decomposition: : \\\\oint_C g(z)\\\\,dz =\\\\oint_C \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{z-z_1}-\\\\frac{1}{z-z_2}\\\\right) \\\\, dz =0-2\\\\pi i-2\\\\pi i =-4\\\\pi i Consequences The integral formula has broad applications. First, it implies that a function which is holomorphic in an open set is in fact infinitely differentiable there. Furthermore, it is an analytic function, meaning that it can be represented as a power series. The proof of this uses the dominated convergence theorem and the geometric series applied to :f(\\\\zeta) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_C \\\\frac{f(z)}{z-\\\\zeta}\\\\,dz. The formula is also used to prove the residue theorem, which is a result for meromorphic functions, and a related result, the argument principle. It is known from Morera's theorem that the uniform limit of holomorphic functions is holomorphic. This can also be deduced from Cauchy's integral formula: indeed the formula also holds in the limit and the integrand, and hence the integral, can be expanded as a power series. In addition the Cauchy formulas for the higher order derivatives show that all these derivatives also converge uniformly. The analog of the Cauchy integral formula in real analysis is the Poisson integral formula for harmonic functions; many of the results for holomorphic functions carry over to this setting. No such results, however, are valid for more general classes of differentiable or real analytic functions. For instance, the existence of the first derivative of a real function need not imply the existence of higher order derivatives, nor in particular the analyticity of the function. Likewise, the uniform limit of a sequence of (real) differentiable functions may fail to be differentiable, or may be differentiable but with a derivative which is not the limit of the derivatives of the members of the sequence. Another consequence is that if is holomorphic in and then the coefficients satisfy Cauchy's inequality :a_n\\\\le r^{-n} \\\\sup_{z=r}f(z). From Cauchy's inequality, one can easily deduce that every bounded entire function must be constant (which is Liouville's theorem). Generalizations =Smooth functions= A version of Cauchy's integral formula is the Cauchy‚ÄìPompeiu formula, and holds for smooth functions as well, as it is based on Stokes' theorem. Let be a disc in and suppose that is a complex-valued function on the closure of . Thenhttp://people.math.carleton.ca/~ckfong/S32.pdf :f(\\\\zeta) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{\\\\partial D} \\\\frac{f(z) \\\\,dz}{z-\\\\zeta} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\iint_D \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\bar{z}}(z) \\\\frac{dx\\\\wedge dy}{z-\\\\zeta}. One may use this representation formula to solve the inhomogeneous Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations in . Indeed, if is a function in , then a particular solution of the equation is a holomorphic function outside the support of . Moreover, if in an open set D, :d\\\\mu = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\varphi \\\\, dz\\\\wedge d\\\\bar{z} for some (where ), then is also in and satisfies the equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{z}} = \\\\varphi(z,\\\\bar{z}). The first conclusion is, succinctly, that the convolution of a compactly supported measure with the Cauchy kernel :k(z) = \\\\operatorname{p.v.}\\\\frac{1}{z} is a holomorphic function off the support of . Here denotes the principal value. The second conclusion asserts that the Cauchy kernel is a fundamental solution of the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations. Note that for smooth complex-valued functions of compact support on the generalized Cauchy integral formula simplifies to :f(\\\\zeta) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\iint \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\bar{z}}\\\\frac{dz\\\\wedge d\\\\bar{z}}{z-\\\\zeta}, and is a restatement of the fact that, considered as a distribution, is a fundamental solution of the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann operator . The generalized Cauchy integral formula can be deduced for any bounded open region with boundary from this result and the formula for the distributional derivative of the characteristic function of : : \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\chi_X}{\\\\partial \\\\bar z}= \\\\frac{i}{2} \\\\oint_{\\\\partial X} \\\\,dz, where the distribution on the right hand side denotes contour integration along . =Several variables= In several complex variables, the Cauchy integral formula can be generalized to polydiscs . Let be the polydisc given as the Cartesian product of open discs : :D = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n D_i. Suppose that is a holomorphic function in continuous on the closure of . Then :f(\\\\zeta) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(2\\\\pi i\\\\right)^n}\\\\int\\\\cdots\\\\iint_{\\\\partial D_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times\\\\partial D_n} \\\\frac{f(z_1,\\\\ldots,z_n)}{(z_1-\\\\zeta_1)\\\\cdots(z_n-\\\\zeta_n)} \\\\, dz_1\\\\cdots dz_n where . =In real algebras= The Cauchy integral formula is generalizable to real vector spaces of two or more dimensions. The insight into this property comes from geometric algebra, where objects beyond scalars and vectors (such as planar bivectors and volumetric trivectors) are considered, and a proper generalization of Stokes' theorem. Geometric calculus defines a derivative operator under its geometric product ‚Äî that is, for a -vector field , the derivative generally contains terms of grade and . For example, a vector field () generally has in its derivative a scalar part, the divergence (), and a bivector part, the curl (). This particular derivative operator has a Green's function: :G\\\\left(\\\\vec r, \\\\vec r'\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{S_n} \\\\frac{\\\\vec r - \\\\vec r'}{\\\\left\\\\vec r - \\\\vec r'\\\\right^n} where is the surface area of a unit -ball in the space (that is, , the circumference of a circle with radius 1, and , the surface area of a sphere with radius 1). By definition of a Green's function, : abla G\\\\left(\\\\vec r, \\\\vec r'\\\\right) = \\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\vec r- \\\\vec r'\\\\right). It is this useful property that can be used, in conjunction with the generalized Stokes theorem: :\\\\oint_{\\\\partial V} d\\\\vec S \\\\; f(\\\\vec r) = \\\\int_V d\\\\vec V \\\\; abla f(\\\\vec r) where, for an -dimensional vector space, is an -vector and is an -vector. The function can, in principle, be composed of any combination of multivectors. The proof of Cauchy's integral theorem for higher dimensional spaces relies on the using the generalized Stokes theorem on the quantity and use of the product rule: :\\\\oint_{\\\\partial V'} G\\\\left(\\\\vec r, \\\\vec r'\\\\right)\\\\; d\\\\vec S' \\\\; f\\\\left(\\\\vec r'\\\\right) = \\\\int_V \\\\left(\\\\left[ abla' G\\\\left(\\\\vec r, \\\\vec r'\\\\right)\\\\right] f\\\\left(\\\\vec r'\\\\right) + G\\\\left(\\\\vec r, \\\\vec r'\\\\right) abla' f\\\\left(\\\\vec r'\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\; d\\\\vec V When , is called a monogenic function, the generalization of holomorphic functions to higher-dimensional spaces ‚Äî indeed, it can be shown that the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann condition is just the two-dimensional expression of the monogenic condition. When that condition is met, the second term in the right- hand integral vanishes, leaving only :\\\\oint_{\\\\partial V'} G\\\\left(\\\\vec r, \\\\vec r'\\\\right)\\\\; d\\\\vec S' \\\\; f\\\\left(\\\\vec r'\\\\right) = \\\\int_V \\\\left[ abla' G\\\\left(\\\\vec r, \\\\vec r'\\\\right)\\\\right] f\\\\left(\\\\vec r'\\\\right) = -\\\\int_V \\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\vec r - \\\\vec r'\\\\right) f\\\\left(\\\\vec r'\\\\right) \\\\; d\\\\vec V =- i_n f(\\\\vec r) where is that algebra's unit -vector, the pseudoscalar. The result is :f(\\\\vec r) =- \\\\frac{1}{i_n} \\\\oint_{\\\\partial V} G\\\\left(\\\\vec r, \\\\vec r'\\\\right)\\\\; d\\\\vec S \\\\; f\\\\left(\\\\vec r'\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{1}{i_n} \\\\oint_{\\\\partial V} \\\\frac{\\\\vec r - \\\\vec r'}{S_n \\\\left\\\\vec r - \\\\vec r'\\\\right^n} \\\\; d\\\\vec S \\\\; f\\\\left(\\\\vec r'\\\\right) Thus, as in the two-dimensional (complex analysis) case, the value of an analytic (monogenic) function at a point can be found by an integral over the surface surrounding the point, and this is valid not only for scalar functions but vector and general multivector functions as well.

It now lies in Isola Farnese, in the comune of Rome. Many other sites associated with and in the city-state of Veii are in Formello, immediately to the north. Formello is named after the drainage channels that were first created by the Veians. Veii was the richest city of the Etruscan League. It was alternately at war and in alliance with the Roman Kingdom and later Republic for over 300 years. It eventually fell in the Battle of Veii to Roman general Camillus's army in 396 BC. Veii continued to be occupied after its capture by the Romans. The site is now a protected area, part of the Parco di Veio established by the regional authority of Lazio in 1997. Neighbourhood of Veii in 450 BC Site of Veii Site = City of Veii= The city of Veii lies mainly on a tuff plateau in area. The Valchetta flows a few miles eastward to join the Tiber River on the south side of Labaro along the Via Flaminia and Veii's territory included this area. Its proximity to the Tiber and the trade route to the interior, which became the Via Flaminia, augmented its prosperity but also placed it in competition with Rome for the domination of Latium. The temple of Juno was the greatest and most honoured in the city.Plutarch: Camillus The largest visible monument is the sanctuary of Minerva from the 7th c. BC, situated along an important route just outside the city (at modern Portonaccio). The sanctuary was one of the oldest and most revered in Etruria, standing out for its sumptuous polychrome terracotta decorations, many of which can be seen today in the Villa Giulia. The sanctuary included the temple of Apollo of about 510 BC to which belonged the Apollo of Veii (now in the National Etruscan Museum). The impressive thermal baths and the forum built under Augustus have been partially excavated in recent years. Many rich Tumuli and chamber tombs have been found. The most famous is the Grotta Campana uncovered in 1843, a chamber tomb with the oldest known Etruscan frescoes. There are also long tunnels leading into the plateau of the city, which may corroborate Livy's account of the Roman victory in the Battle of Veii. The walls of Veii, of which small sections remain, bordered the two intersecting streams using the streambeds as a ditch, with a wall across the plateau closing the triangle. =Piazza d'Armi= Every Etruscan stronghold was built on an elevation, and Veii was no exception. Its arx, or citadel, was placed on a bluff delineated by cliffs within the angle of confluence of the two streams, nearly separated from the main ridge by a gully, through which ran a road in the Roman period. An archaeological site, Piazza d'Armi (\\"military square\\"), marks the location today. History =Early history= The earliest evidence of occupation by demographic analysis, including that of the cemeteries, dates from the 10th century BC in the Late Bronze Age. Small settlements were scattered over a wider area than the plateau and the population of the plateau at Veii is estimated to have been stable at about 1000. In the 9th century BC, the Early Iron Age (Villanovan culture), the finds are localised to the plateau but appear to be associated with independent settlements, each with its own cemetery. Occupation gradually intensified in the 8th (remainder of Villanovan) and 7th (Orientalising Period) centuries BC, by conurbation of the settlements as the site assumed an urban appearance with city blocks in a grid pattern arranged around a central square containing a water cistern. That evidence suggests that the city of Veii was shaped into its classical form in the 7th century BC by a population, presumably Etruscan, first settling there in the 10th century BC. The population of the early Veii practised both inhumation and cremation within the same family. The proportion was 50% in the 9th century BC, after a predomination of cremation (90%) earlier. In the 8th century, inhumation rose to 70%, which may be attributable to an influence from Latium, where inhumation prevailed in the 9th century BC. During the 9th and 8th centuries BC, the population density and grave goods were on the increase: more and wealthier people and also more of a disparity in wealth: the rise of a richer class. In the 8th century BC, both the potter's wheel and writing were introduced from Greece. During the entire period, the settlements translocated around the plateau; however, a settlement (Casale del Fosso) maintained a cemetery to the north of the plateau continuously from the late 9th century BC to the early 6th century BC. =Conflict with Rome= The documented history of Veii, like that of all Italian cities in their early centuries, is sparse and unreliable. According to Livy (writing 700 years later) the Fidenates and the Veientes were defeated in a war with Rome during the reign of Rome's mythical first king, Romulus, in the 8th century BC.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1:14-15 Plutarch (writing even later in the 1st C. AD)Plutarch: Romulus says of them: > The first (to oppose Romulus) were the Veientes, a people of Tuscany (the > site is now in Lazio), who had large possessions, and dwelt in a spacious > city; they took occasion to commence a war, by claiming Fidenae as belonging > to them....However this account differs from Livy's who refers to at least > one war fought by Rome prior to the dispute with Veii, being the war with > the Sabines and others arising out of the Rape of the Sabine Women Apollo of Veii, dating from around 510 BC, in the Villa Giulia museum of Rome. Fidenae and Veii were said to have again been defeated by Rome in the 7th century BC during the reign of Rome's third king Tullus Hostilius. In the 6th century BC Rome's sixth king Servius Tullius warred against Veii (after the expiry of an earlier truce) and the Etruscans. He is said to have shown valour in the campaign, and to have routed a great army of the enemy. The war helped him to cement his position at Rome.Livy Ab urbe condita 1.42 In 509 BC, after the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, the family of Tarquinius Superbus went into exile in Caere in Etruria. Tarquin sought to regain the throne, at first by the Tarquinian conspiracy and, when that failed, by force of arms. He convinced the cities of Tarquinii and Veii to support him, and led their armies against Rome in the Battle of Silva Arsia. The Roman army was victorious, and it is recorded by Livy that although the forces of Tarquinii fought well on the right wing, initially pushing back the Roman left wing, the Veientes on the left wing faltered and fled the battle, because they were accustomed to defeat at the hands of the Romans. After the loss of the battle the forces of Veii returned home.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.6-7 Livy writes that later in 509 BC, consul Publius Valerius Publicola returned to fight the Veientes.Livy, Ab urbe condita 2.8 The most famous king of Veii was Lars Tolumnus whose family was part of the Veientine aristocracyC. J. Smith, The Roman Clan: The Gens from Ancient Ideology to Modern Anthropology, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 161 ff and who instigated a war with Rome in 438 BC.Livy, iv. 17 The nearby Roman colony of Fidenae revolted against Rome and allied itself with Veii, giving Tolumnus control of the Fidenate army. The Romans sent four envoys to demand an explanation but they were murdered. Rome declared war against Veii and sent Lucius Sergius with an army who won the battle but the Roman losses were so high that a state of emergency was declared. A subsequent fiercely-fought battle with Veii in 437 BC reinforced by a contingent from Falerii was indecisive until the tribune Aulus Cornelius Cossus unhorsed Tolumnus and killed him with his spear. In 406 BC, Rome declared war against Veii, still powerful and well-fortified, and her allies Falerii and Capena which required the Romans to commence a siege lasting many years. As Plutarch says: > Veii had been the capital of Etruria, not inferior to Rome, either in number > of arms or multitude of soldiers, so that relying on her wealth and luxury, > and priding herself upon her refinement and sumptuousness, she had engaged > in many honourable contests with the Romans for glory and empire .......... > as the city was furnished with all sorts of weapons, offensive and > defensive, likewise with corn and all manner of provisions, they cheerfully > endured a siege After ten years, in 396 BC, the Romans appointed Camillus as dictator. After defeating both Falerii and Capena at Nepete, Camillus commanded the final strike against Veii. He dug into the soft tuff rock below the walls whilst distracting the Veiians with attacks on the walls and infiltrated the city's drainage system to emerge in the citadel, leading to their defeat. Not interested in surrender but only in Veii's complete destruction, the Romans slaughtered the entire adult male population and made slaves of all the women and children. The plunder was very rich and extensive including the statue of Juno taken to Rome. Camillus supported the patricians in opposing the plebeian plan to populate Veii with half of the city of Rome designed to resolve poverty and space issues. Camillus deliberately protracted the project until its abandonment. =Roman and later history= The city was soon assimilated under Roman control and is termed \\"Roman Veii\\" as opposed to \\"Etruscan Veii\\" by scholarly literature. Under the empire the Romans called the city the Municipium Augustum Veiens. The city never recovered its former wealth or its population after the Roman conquest. Nevertheless, after Rome's defeat in the battle of the Allia, many Roman soldiers fled there, and a project was proposed for abandoning Rome for Veii; this project was successfully opposed by Camillus. The Romans built wealthy villas in the region and Livia had an estate there, according to Suetonius. Veii was eventually abandoned after Roman times, and everything of value or utility was removed by anyone with access to the site. Finally it was filled and smoothed for ploughland and was forgotten until its rediscovery in the 17th century by the antiquarian Raffaello Fabretti. =Ager Veientanus= The territory of a city-state anywhere within the Roman domain was, in Roman legal terminology, an ager. The law made a number of fine distinctions, but by ager it meant primarily ager publicus, \\"public territory\\", the land belonging to the state, which in those times was primarily agricultural (ager is \\"field\\"). The ager Veientanus (i.e. of Veii) covered the entire region between the right bank of the lower Tiber river and the coast; that is all of southern Etruria. The northwest border was probably as far west as the Monti Sabatini and Lake Bracciano in the north. In Etruscan times the ager Veiantanus shared the countryside with the Silva Ciminia, the remnant of an ancient forest, of which the Romans stood in superstitious dread. The ager Veiantanus remained for the most part agrarian until it became evident after World War II that the city of Rome was going to expand into and develop that area as a suburb. Moreover, a new method of ploughing was turning over the soil a metre deep, destroying all surface evidence. John Bryan Ward-Perkins, then Director of the British School at Rome, set into motion the South Etruria Survey (1954‚Äì1968), which cataloged all the visible antiquities in the ager Veientanus. It was published in 1968. Nearly 30 years later, in 1997, the Italian government moved to protect a part of that area, creating the Veio Regional Natural Park of between the Via Cassia on the west, the Via Flaminia on the east, the Via Campagnanese on the north and the city of Rome on the south. Within the park are the comuni of Campagnano di Roma, Castelnuovo di Porto, Formello, Magliano Romano, Mazzano Romano, Morlupo, Riano, Sacrofano and Municipio XX of the city of Rome.

The pendulum was introduced in 1851 and was the first experiment to give simple, direct evidence of the Earth's rotation. Foucault pendulums today are popular displays in science museums and universities. Original Foucault pendulum Foucault's pendulum in the Panth√©on, Paris A Print of the Foucault Pendulum, 1895 The first public exhibition of a Foucault pendulum took place in February 1851 in the Meridian of the Paris Observatory. A few weeks later, Foucault made his most famous pendulum when he suspended a brass-coated lead bob with a wire from the dome of the Panth√©on, Paris. The period of the pendulum was 2\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{l}{g}}=16.5 seconds. Because the latitude of its location was \\\\phi\\\\, = 48¬∞52' N, the plane of the pendulum's swing made a full circle in approximately \\\\frac{23h56'}{\\\\sin \\\\phi} = 31.8 hours (31 hours 50 minutes), rotating clockwise approximately 11.3¬∞ per hour. The original bob used in 1851 at the Panth√©on was moved in 1855 to the Conservatoire des Arts et M√©tiers in Paris. A second temporary installation was made for the 50th anniversary in 1902. During museum reconstruction in the 1990s, the original pendulum was temporarily displayed at the Panth√©on (1995), but was later returned to the Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers before it reopened in 2000. On April 6, 2010, the cable suspending the bob in the Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers snapped, causing irreparable damage to the pendulum bob and to the marble flooring of the museum. The original, now damaged pendulum bob is displayed in a separate case adjacent to the current pendulum display. An exact copy of the original pendulum has been operating under the dome of the Panth√©on, Paris since 1995. Explanation of mechanics 250pxthumbrightAnimation of a Foucault pendulum on the northern hemisphere, with the Earth's rotation rate greatly exaggerated. The green trace shows the path of the pendulum bob over the ground (a rotating reference frame), while in any vertical plane. The actual plane of swing appears to rotate relative to the Earth. The wire should be as long as possible‚Äîlengths of are common. At either the Geographic North Pole or Geographic South Pole, the plane of oscillation of a pendulum remains fixed relative to the distant masses of the universe while Earth rotates underneath it, taking one sidereal day to complete a rotation. So, relative to Earth, the plane of oscillation of a pendulum at the North Pole ‚Äì viewed from above ‚Äì undergoes a full clockwise rotation during one day; a pendulum at the South Pole rotates counterclockwise. When a Foucault pendulum is suspended at the equator, the plane of oscillation remains fixed relative to Earth. At other latitudes, the plane of oscillation precesses relative to Earth, but more slowly than at the pole; the angular speed, (measured in clockwise degrees per sidereal day), is proportional to the sine of the latitude, : where latitudes north and south of the equator are defined as positive and negative, respectively. For example, a Foucault pendulum at 30¬∞ south latitude, viewed from above by an earthbound observer, rotates counterclockwise 360¬∞ in two days. A Foucault pendulum at the North Pole: The pendulum swings in the same plane as the Earth rotates beneath it. To demonstrate rotation directly rather than indirectly via the swinging pendulum, Foucault used a gyroscope in an 1852 experiment. The inner gimbal of the Foucault gyroscope was balanced on knife edge bearings on the outer gimbal and the outer gimbal was suspended by a fine, torsion-free thread in such a manner that the lower pivot point carried almost no weight. The gyro was spun to 9,000‚Äì12,000 revolutions per minute with an arrangement of gears before being placed into position, which was sufficient time to balance the gyroscope and carry out 10 minutes of experimentation. The instrument could be observed either with a microscope viewing a tenth of a degree scale or by a long pointer. At least three more copies of a Foucault gyro were made in convenient travelling and demonstration boxes and copies survive in the UK, France, and the US. An excerpt from the illustrated supplement of the magazine Le Petit Parisien dated November 2, 1902, on the 50th anniversary of the experiment of L√©on Foucault demonstrating the rotation of the earth. A Foucault pendulum requires care to set up because imprecise construction can cause additional veering which masks the terrestrial effect. As observed by later Nobel laureate Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who developed a fuller theory of Foucault pendulum for his doctoral thesis (1879), geometrical imperfection of the system or elasticity of the support wire may cause an interference between two horizontal modes of oscillation, which caused Onnes' pendulum to go over from linear to elliptic oscillation in an hour. The initial launch of the pendulum is also critical; the traditional way to do this is to use a flame to burn through a thread which temporarily holds the bob in its starting position, thus avoiding unwanted sideways motion (see a detail of the launch at the 50th anniversary in 1902). Notably, veering of the pendulum was observed already in 1661 by Vincenzo Viviani, a disciple of Galileo, but there is no evidence that he connected the effect with the Earth rotation; rather, he regarded it as a nuisance in his study that should be overcome with suspending the bob on two ropes instead of one. Air resistance damps the oscillation, so some Foucault pendulums in museums incorporate an electromagnetic or other drive to keep the bob swinging; others are restarted regularly, sometimes with a launching ceremony as an added attraction. Besides air resistance, the other main engineering problem in creating a 1-meter Foucault pendulum nowadays is said to be ensuring there is no preferred direction of swing. The animation describes the motion of a Foucault pendulum at a latitude of 30¬∞N. The plane of oscillation rotates by an angle of ‚àí180¬∞ during one day, so after two days, the plane returns to its original orientation. A \\"pendulum day\\" is the time needed for the plane of a freely suspended Foucault pendulum to complete an apparent rotation about the local vertical. This is one sidereal day divided by the sine of the latitude. Precession as a form of parallel transport Parallel transport of a vector around a closed loop on the sphere: The angle by which it twists, , is proportional to the area inside the loop. In a near- inertial frame moving in tandem with Earth, but not sharing the rotation of the earth about its own axis, the suspension point of the pendulum traces out a circular path during one sidereal day. At the latitude of Paris, 48 degrees 51 minutes north, a full precession cycle takes just under 32 hours, so after one sidereal day, when the Earth is back in the same orientation as one sidereal day before, the oscillation plane has turned by just over 270 degrees. If the plane of swing was north‚Äìsouth at the outset, it is east‚Äìwest one sidereal day later. This also implies that there has been exchange of momentum; the Earth and the pendulum bob have exchanged momentum. The Earth is so much more massive than the pendulum bob that the Earth's change of momentum is unnoticeable. Nonetheless, since the pendulum bob's plane of swing has shifted, the conservation laws imply that an exchange must have occurred. Rather than tracking the change of momentum, the precession of the oscillation plane can efficiently be described as a case of parallel transport. For that, it can be demonstrated, by composing the infinitesimal rotations, that the precession rate is proportional to the projection of the angular velocity of Earth onto the normal direction to Earth, which implies that the trace of the plane of oscillation will undergo parallel transport. After 24 hours, the difference between initial and final orientations of the trace in the Earth frame is , which corresponds to the value given by the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem. is also called the holonomy or geometric phase of the pendulum. When analyzing earthbound motions, the Earth frame is not an inertial frame, but rotates about the local vertical at an effective rate of radians per day. A simple method employing parallel transport within cones tangent to the Earth's surface can be used to describe the rotation angle of the swing plane of Foucault's pendulum. From the perspective of an Earth-bound coordinate system with its -axis pointing east and its -axis pointing north, the precession of the pendulum is described by the Coriolis force. Consider a planar pendulum with natural frequency in the small angle approximation. There are two forces acting on the pendulum bob: the restoring force provided by gravity and the wire, and the Coriolis force. The Coriolis force at latitude is horizontal in the small angle approximation and is given by where is the rotational frequency of Earth, is the component of the Coriolis force in the -direction and is the component of the Coriolis force in the -direction. The restoring force, in the small-angle approximation, is given by Graphs of precession period and precession per sidereal day vs latitude. The sign changes as a Foucault pendulum rotates anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. The example shows that one in Paris precesses 271¬∞ each sidereal day, taking 31.8 hours per rotation. Using Newton's laws of motion this leads to the system of equations Switching to complex coordinates , the equations read To first order in this equation has the solution If time is measured in days, then and the pendulum rotates by an angle of during one day. Related physical systems The device described by Wheatstone. Many physical systems precess in a similar manner to a Foucault pendulum. As early as 1836, the Scottish mathematician Edward Sang contrived and explained the precession of a spinning top. In 1851, Charles Wheatstone Charles Wheatstone Wikisource: \\"Note relating to M. Foucault's new mechanical proof of the Rotation of the Earth\\", pp. 65‚Äì68. described an apparatus that consists of a vibrating spring that is mounted on top of a disk so that it makes a fixed angle with the disk. The spring is struck so that it oscillates in a plane. When the disk is turned, the plane of oscillation changes just like the one of a Foucault pendulum at latitude . Similarly, consider a nonspinning, perfectly balanced bicycle wheel mounted on a disk so that its axis of rotation makes an angle with the disk. When the disk undergoes a full clockwise revolution, the bicycle wheel will not return to its original position, but will have undergone a net rotation of . Foucault-like precession is observed in a virtual system wherein a massless particle is constrained to remain on a rotating plane that is inclined with respect to the axis of rotation. Spin of a relativistic particle moving in a circular orbit precesses similar to the swing plane of Foucault pendulum. The relativistic velocity space in Minkowski spacetime can be treated as a sphere S3 in 4-dimensional Euclidean space with imaginary radius and imaginary timelike coordinate. Parallel transport of polarization vectors along such sphere gives rise to Thomas precession, which is analogous to the rotation of the swing plane of Foucault pendulum due to parallel transport along a sphere S2 in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. In physics, the evolution of such systems is determined by geometric phases.\\"Geometric Phases in Physics\\", eds. Frank Wilczek and Alfred Shapere (World Scientific, Singapore, 1989).L. Mangiarotti, G. Sardanashvily, Gauge Mechanics (World Scientific, Singapore, 1998) Mathematically they are understood through parallel transport. Foucault pendulums around the world There are numerous Foucault pendulums at universities, science museums, and the like throughout the world. The United Nations headquarters in New York City has one; the largest is at the Oregon Convention Center: its length is approximately .

The pendulum had a length of and the bob weighed . The location was ideal: no moving air could disturb the pendulum, and the low viscosity of the cold air reduced air resistance. The researchers confirmed about 24 hours as the rotation period of the plane of oscillation.

It comprises three provinces: Cha√±aral, Copiap√≥ and Huasco. It is bordered to the north by Antofagasta, to the south by Coquimbo, to east with Provinces of Catamarca, La Rioja and San Juan of Argentina, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean. The regional capital Copiap√≥ is located at north of the country's capital of Santiago. The region occupies the southern portion of the Atacama Desert, the rest of the desert is mainly distributed among the other regions of Norte Grande. Demography The Atacama Region is the third least populated region of the country, after Aysen and Magallanes. Of its total population, over 50% are located in the cities of Copiap√≥ and Vallenar. The largest cities are (2002 census data) Copiap√≥ (125,983 inhabitants), Vallenar (43,750), Caldera (12,776), Cha√±aral (12,086), El Salvador (8,697) Tierra Amarilla (8,578), and Diego de Almagro (7,951). History The original inhabitants of this area, the Diaguitas and Changos valued its mineral wealth. Since the 19th century, iron, copper, silver, and gold have brought prosperity. The region experienced a boom when the Cha√±arcillo silver mine was discovered in 1832. For many years, this was the world's third largest silver mine. Natural features Much of the region is desert, and encompasses considerable mineral resources.Teresa Moreno and Wes Gibbons. 2007 Numerous flora and fauna species are found in the Atacama Region. One subspecies of the lesser rhea, known by the scientific name Rhea pennata tarapacensis, is a notable large terrestrial bird in this region, which subspecies is considered endangered. The diminished numbers of this bird are due to prehistoric and modern hunting but more significantly due to agricultural land conversion in order to feed the expanding human population.

Moreover, various geological surveys have identified new deposits. Iron ore mining is the most dynamic activity and there are numerous small- scale mines, which sell their output to ENAMI (the national mining company) for processing at its Paipote smelter. The region's main copper deposit is Candelaria, which produces around 200,000 tonnes per year and is controlled by Phelps Dodge, an international corporation. The next in size is El Salvador, owned by CODELCO, with an annual output of around 81,000 tonnes. Both mines export through the port of Cha√±aral. Irrigated fields in the outskirts Copiap√≥. Over recent decades, fresh fruit also emerged as regional export item, when the Copiap√≥ and Huasco valleys joined Chile‚Äôs fruit-growing boom. They enjoy a comparative advantage because, thanks to the sunny climate, fruit ripens earlier than in the rest of the country and reaches northern hemisphere markets first. Grapes are the main crop and, on a smaller scale, olives, tomatoes, peppers, onions, broad beans, citrus fruits, nectarines, apricots, oregano, and flowers. The region's organic wealth, its clear waters and sheltered bays, together with its entrepreneurial experience, favor the development of aquaculture. Species produced include the northern scallop, Japanese and Chilean oysters, abalone, turbot, algae, and different varieties of mussels. Other products with more value added include boned fish fillets, smoked and salted fish, roe, and fishburgers. The unique weather conditions in the Atacama desert, with extremely rare cloudy days, are ideal for solar power generation. Many PV and CSP plants are being built in this area.

Etruria (; usually referred to in Greek source texts as Tyrrhenia, ) was a region of Central Italy, located in an area that covered part of what are now Tuscany, Lazio, and Umbria. Etruscan Etruria The ancient people of Etruria are labeled Etruscans. Their complex culture was centered on numerous city-states that rose during the Villanovan period in the ninth century BC, and they were very powerful during the Orientalizing Archaic periods. The Etruscans were a dominant culture in Italy by 650 BC,Rix, Helmut. \\"Etruscan.\\" In The Ancient Languages of Europe, ed. Roger D. Woodard. Cambridge University Press, 2008, pp. 141‚Äì164. surpassing other ancient Italic peoples such as the Ligures, and their influence may be seen beyond Etruria's confines in the Po River Valley and Latium, as well as in Campania and through their contact with the Greek colonies in Southern Italy (including Sicily). Indeed, at some Etruscan tombs, such as those of the Tumulus di Montefortini at Comeana (see Carmignano) in Tuscany, physical evidence of trade with Egypt has been found‚Äîfine Egyptian faience cups are an example. Such trade occurred either directly with Egypt or through intermediaries such as Greek or Phoenician sailors. Rome, separated from Etruria by the Silva Ciminia, the Ciminian Forest, was influenced strongly by the Etruscans, with a series of Etruscan kings ruling at Rome until 509 BC when the last Etruscan king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus was removed from power and the Roman Republic was established.Cary, M.; Scullard, H. H., A History of Rome. Page 28. 3rd Ed. 1979. . The Etruscans are credited with influencing Rome's architecture and ritual practice; it was under the Etruscan kings that important structures such as the Capitolium, Cloaca Maxima, and Via Sacra were realized. The Etruscan civilization was responsible for much of the Greek culture imported into early Republican Rome, including the twelve Olympian gods, the growing of olives and grapes, the Latin alphabet (adapted from the Greek alphabet), and architecture like the arch, sewerage and drainage systems. Territorial subdivision of Etruria Etruria is usually divided into two main territories, called Northern Etruria and Southern Etruria, to which must be added the northernmost territories, called Etruria Padana, and the southernmost territories called Etruria Campana. * Northern Etruria. Much of modern Tuscany, from the Arno river to the north, the Apennines to the east, and the Albegna river to the south of Tuscany. Furthermore, the Etruscan territories up to Perugia in modern Umbria. * Southern Etruria. Small portions of the most southern areas of Tuscany, all of northern and central Lazio to the gates of Rome. * Etruria Padana (Padanian Etruria). Territories in Emilia-Romagna and in the southern extremity of Lombardy and Veneto, in northern Italy. * Etruria Campana (Campanian Etruria). Some territories in the Campania region of southern Italy. Roman Etruria In the Augustan organization of Italy, Etruria was the name of a region (Regio VII), whose borders were the Tiber, the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Apuan Alps and the Apennines, roughly coincident with those of pre-Roman Etruria. Etruria in later times The Grand Duchy of Tuscany (which existed 1569‚Äì1801 and 1814‚Äì1859) styled itself in Latin as Magnus Ducatus Etruriae (Grand Duchy of Etruria). The name Etruria was also applied to the Kingdom of Etruria, an ephemeral client state of Napoleon I of France which replaced the Grand Duchy between 1801 and 1807. A particularly noteworthy work dealing with Etruscan locations is D. H. Lawrence's Sketches of Etruscan Places and other Italian essays.

La Serena La Serena Vicu√±a Night view of Coquimbo's port. The Coquimbo Region (, ) is one of Chile's 16 regions (first order administrative divisions). It is bordered by Atacama to the north, Valpara√≠so to the south, Argentina to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It is approximately north of the national capital, Santiago. The capital and largest city is La Serena. Other important cities include the seaport Coquimbo and the agricultural centre Ovalle. Ovalle Panoramic Geography and ecology The Coquimbo Region forms the narrowest part, or 'waist' of Chile, and is hence one of the country's more mountainous regions, as the Andes range runs closer to the sea than elsewhere. The region has notable marine species as well as taxa that are associated with the mountainous regions. With respect to marine organisms, the upwelling areas encourage bioproductivity off of this Pacific Coast area of Chile.R.N. Gibson, R.J.A. Atkinson and J.D.M. Gordon, 2007 In the southern mountainous areas of the Coquimbo Region, the rare and endangered Chilean Wine Palm is found, whose habitat is threatened by human overpopulation in the region and associated deforestation for residential expansion and agriculture.C. Michael Hogan, 2008 The Elqui Valley is home to a number of astronomical observatories, owing to the region's clear skies. It is also home to a 600-meter-long dam, the Puclaro, which confines the Elqui River and produces a reservoir of some seven km in length. Demography Mining and agricultural activities account for the location of various places in the region, around the transverse valleys and mineral deposits. Originally this organization was structured according to the location of Indian villages of the Diaguitas. A high percentage (70‚Äì75%) of inhabitants are of Mestizo (Euro-Amerindian) background, higher than any other region in Chile. Other indigenous peoples include the Aymara, Atacameno, Mapuche and Quechua whom were immigrants themselves from Peru and Bolivia. Recent high population growth stresses the conurbation La Serena-Coquimbo (est. 300,000 or 297,253 inhabitants), which concentrates half the regional population. In terms of population, major cities are (according to the 2002 census): La Serena (148,815), Coquimbo (148,438), Ovalle (66,405), Illapel (21,826), Vicu√±a (12,910), Salamanca (11,615), and Los Vilos (10,966). Economy This region is a very popular travel destination. Visitors are mainly attracted to its long beaches, many of fine white sand, bathed by a calm sea, and the region's pleasant climate. Along with tourism, the province's main industries are agriculture and fishing. The mountains are a center of astronomy in Chile. Communications =Printed press= The first newspaper published in this region was El Minero de Coquimbo in 1828.

After 870 AD the town belonged to East Francia, which turned into the Holy Roman Empire. During the German Peasants' War the town was occupied, in 1525, by the insurgents, who were driven out in their turn by Duke Anton of Lorraine. It suffered much from the ravages of the Thirty Years' War, but the episcopal palace, then destroyed, was subsequently rebuilt. After 1680 the town was annexed by the French. The episcopal palace was in 1852 converted by Louis Napoleon into a place of residence for widows of knights of the Legion of Honour. Saverne was conquered by Imperial Germany after the Franco-Prussian War. It was returned to French control after World War I. In 1913, the city was the theater of the infamous \\"Saverne Affair\\". This event gave rise to the term Zabernism (from the German name of the town), meaning abuse of military authority, or unwarranted aggression. Sights The emblem of the town is a unicorn. Legend has it that a unicorn's horn was found in one of the nearby castles in ruins. It is more likely that a narwhal's tooth was discovered and mistaken for a unicorn's horn. However, it gave its name to the local beer (fr: Bi√®re de la Licorne) and to the Karlsbr√§u brewery (f: Brasserie la Licorne) making it. Its principal building, the Rohan Castle (Ch√¢teau des Rohan), is the former residence of the bishops of Strasbourg, rebuilt by Cardinal de Rohan in 1779, it was used by the Germans as barracks. It now houses the city museum with its large archeological collection of Roman and Celtic artifacts, a hostel, a small arts and crafts museum as well as the collection of 20th century and ethnological art donated by feminist journalist and politician Louise Weiss. Other sights include the 15th century former castle (Ch√¢teau vieux) and the adjacent 15th century Roman Catholic parish church of Notre-Dame-de-la-Nativit√© with fine stained glass and sculptures; a Gothic former Franciscan, then R√©collets, monastery with a church and a cloister ornated by 17th-century frescoes; as well as several old houses, among which the heavily decorated Maison Katz stands out. In the vicinity are the ruined castles of Haut-Barr, Grand Geroldseck, Ochsenstein and Greifenstein. Hence a road, immortalized by Goethe in Dichtung und Wahrheit, leads across the Vosges to Pfalzburg. The mountain pass (Col de Saverne) contains a vast botanical garden, the Jardin botanique du col de Saverne. Saverne is also known for its Rose Garden, locally known as La roseraie. It is also the host of the International Contest of New Roses every year. The Garden itself blesses visitors with over 550 varieties of roses. Chappe semaphore tower near Saverne, France An old semaphore tower, relief of the former Landau (and later Strasbourg) to Paris semaphore line, can be seen in the vicinity.

The west district of the Silesian Metropolis, a metropolis with a population of around 2 million. It is in the Silesian Highlands, on the Bytomka River, a tributary of the Oder. Zabrze is located in the Silesian Voivodeship, which was reformulated in 1999. Before 1999 it was in Katowice Voivodeship. It is one of the cities composing the 2.7 million inhabitant conurbation referred to as the Katowice urban area, itself a major centre in the greater Silesian metropolitan area which is populated by just over five million people.European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON) The population of Zabrze as of December 2019 is 172,360, down from June 2009 when the population was 188,122. History =Early history= A historic metallurgical building in Zabrze Biskupice (Biskupitz), which is now a subdivision of Zabrze, was first mentioned in 1243 as Biscupici dicitur cirka Bitom. Zabrze (or Old Zabrze) was mentioned in 1295-1305 as Sadbre sive Cunczindorf (German for Konrad/Kunze's village; sive = \\"or\\"). In the Late Middle Ages, the local Silesian Piast dukes invited German settlers into the territory, resulting in increasing German settlement. The settlement was part of the Silesian duchies of fragmented Poland. Zabrze became part of the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria in 1526, and was later annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the Silesian Wars. In 1774, the Dorotheendorf settlement was founded. When the first mine in Zabrze became operational in 1790, the town became an important mining center. In the 19th century, new coal mines, steelworks, factories and a power plant were created. A road connecting Gliwice and Chorz√≥w and a railway connecting Opole and ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice were led through Zabrze. =Early 20th century= In 1905, the Zabrze commune was formed by the former communes Alt-Zabrze, Klein-Zabrze and Dorotheendorf. The Zabrze commune was renamed Hindenburg in 1915 in honour of Generalfeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg. The name change was approved by Emperor Wilhelm II on 21 February 1915.Historia - Hindenburg at the official website of Zabrze Up till then, it was one of the few cities whose Polish name was retained during German rule. In 1904 the \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" Polish Gymnastic Society in Zabrze was established, which was also a Polish patriotic and pro- independence organization. As a result of the Prussian harassment it was liquidated in 1911, but it was reactivated twice, in 1913 and 1918.Encyklopedia powsta≈Ñ ≈õlƒÖskich, Instytut ≈ölƒÖski w Opolu, Opole, 1982, p. 637 Its members took an active part in the post-war plebiscite campaign and the Silesian uprisings. =Interwar period= historic-like architecture on Wolno≈õci (Liberty) Street in Zabrze During the plebiscite held after World War I, 21,333 inhabitants (59%) of the Hindenburg commune voted to remain in Germany, while 14,873 (41%) voted for incorporation to Poland, which just regained its independence. In May 1921 the Third Silesian Uprising broke out and Hindenburg was captured by Polish insurgents, who held it until the end of the uprising. When Upper Silesia was divided between Poland and Germany in 1921, the Hindenburg commune remained in Germany. It received its city charter in 1922. Just five years after receiving city rights Hindenburg became the biggest city in German-ruled western Upper Silesia and the second biggest city in German-ruled Silesia after Wroc≈Çaw (then Breslau). Nevertheless, various Polish organizations still operated in the city in the interbellum, including a local branch of the Union of Poles in Germany, Polish libraries, sports clubs, credit unions, choirs, scout troops and an amateur theater. Polish newspaper G≈Ços Ludu was published in the city. In a secret Sicherheitsdienst report from 1934, Zabrze was named one of the main centers of the Polish movement in western Upper Silesia. In terms of religion, most of the city's population adhered to the Catholic Church. In the 1920s, the communists, Christian democrats and nationalists enjoyed the greatest support among the German population, while Poles supported Polish parties. In 1928, among the largest cities in western Upper Silesia, Polish parties received the most votes in Zabrze. In the March 1933 elections, most of the citizens voted for the Nazi Party, followed by Zentrum and the Communist Party. Nazi politician Max Fillusch became the city's mayor and remained in the position until 1945.Stadtkreis Zabrze at Geschichte on Demand website A monument commemorating the fallen in the fight for the liberation of Silesia in the Silesian Uprisings and World War II The anti-Polish organization Bund Deutscher Osten was very active in the city, it dealt with propaganda, indoctrination and espionage of the Polish community, as well as denouncing Poles to local authorities. When, the (traditional holiday of miners) church services were organized separately for Poles and Germans in 1936, the Polish service enjoyed a greater attendance, however, due to Nazi oppression and propaganda, the attendance at Polish services in the 1930s gradually decreased, according to Bund Deutscher Osten. Polish activists were increasingly persecuted since 1937. People were urged to Germanise their names, Polish inscriptions were removed from tombstones. Some Polish priests were expelled from the city, both before and during World War II. As a result of German persecution the Jewish community dropped from 1,154 people in 1933 to 551 in 1939, and its remainder was deported to Nazi concentration camps in 1942. The town's synagogue, that had stood since 1872, was destroyed in the Kristallnacht pogroms of November 1938.Ghetto Fighters' House archives, Photo No. 55805: a memorial monument placed by the Zabrze municipality in 1998 to commemorate its Jewish community. =World War Two= Ludwik coal mine, closed down in 1978 During World War II, in 1941 the German administration requisitioned church property, in which it removed Polish symbols and memorabilia. Church bells were confiscated for war purposes in 1942. The Germans established three working parties of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner- of-war camp in the city, and also a subcamp of Auschwitz III was located there. In January 1945, the Soviets captured the city and afterwards deported some inhabitants to the Soviet Union, while some of the German inhabitants were expelled west. =Contemporary history= Following World War II, according to the Potsdam Agreement the city was handed over to Poland in 1945 and the town's name was changed to the historic Zabrze on 19 May 1945. The first post-war mayor of Zabrze was Pawe≈Ç Dubiel, pre-war Polish activist and journalist in Upper Silesia, prisoner of the Dachau and Mauthausen Nazi concentration camps during the war. The pre-war Polish inhabitants of the region, who formed the majority of the city's population in 1948, were joined by Poles expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The city limits were largely expanded in 1951, by including Mikulczyce, Rokitnica, Grzybowice, Makoszowy, Ko≈Ñczyce and Paw≈Ç√≥w as new districts. New neighbourhoods were built from the 1950s to 1990s. In 1948, G√≥rnik Zabrze football club was founded, which won its first Polish championship in 1957, and soon became the pride of the city as one of the most successful clubs in Poland. Administrative division Districts of Zabrze On 17 September 2012, the Zabrze city council decided on a new administrative division of the city. Zabrze was subsequently divided into 15 districts and 3 housing estates.Zestawienie liczby mieszka≈Ñc√≥w z uwzglƒôdnieniem podzia≈Çu na dzielnice na dzie≈Ñ: 30-09-2013. * 1. Helenka * 2.

The device may be electronic, mechanical, or a combination of the two (electromechanical). The noun derives from ancient Greek , hod√≥metron, from , hod√≥s (\\"path\\" or \\"gateway\\") and , m√©tron (\\"measure\\"). Early forms of the odometer existed in the ancient Greco-Roman world as well as in ancient China. In countries using Imperial units or US customary units it is sometimes called a mileometer or milometer, the former name especially being prevalent in the United Kingdom and among members of the Commonwealth.  History  = Classical Era = Hero's odometer, 1st century AD, Alexandria, Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum Possibly the first evidence for the use of an odometer can be found in the works of the ancient Roman Pliny (NH 6. 61-62) and the ancient Greek Strabo (11.8.9). Both authors list the distances of routes traveled by Alexander the Great (r. 336-323 BC) as by his bematists Diognetus and Baeton. However, the high accuracy of the bematists's measurements rather indicates the use of a mechanical device. For example, the section between the cities Hecatompylos and Alexandria Areion, which later became a part of the silk road, was given by Alexander's bematists as 529 English miles long, that is with a deviation of 0.2% from the actual distance (531 English miles). From the nine surviving bematists' measurements in Pliny's Naturalis Historia eight show a deviation of less than 5% from the actual distance, three of them being within 1%. Since these minor discrepancies can be adequately explained by slight changes in the tracks of roads during the last 2300 years, the overall accuracy of the measurements implies that the bematists already must have used a sophisticated device for measuring distances, although there is no direct mention of such a device. An odometer for measuring distance was first described by Vitruvius around 27 and 23 BC, although the actual inventor may have been Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 BC ‚Äì c. 212 BC) during the First Punic War. Hero of Alexandria (10 AD ‚Äì 70 AD) describes a similar device in chapter 34 of his Dioptra. The machine was also used in the time of Roman Emperor Commodus (c. 192 AD), although after this point in time there seems to be a gap between its use in Roman times and that of the 15th century in Western Europe. Some researchers have speculated that the device might have included technology similar to that of the Greek Antikythera mechanism. The odometer of Vitruvius was based on chariot wheels of diameter turning 400 times in one Roman mile (about 1400 m). For each revolution a pin on the axle engaged a 400 tooth cogwheel thus turning it one complete revolution per mile. This engaged another gear with holes along the circumference, where pebbles (calculus) were located, that were to drop one by one into a box. The distance traveled would thus be given simply by counting the number of pebbles. Whether this instrument was ever built at the time is disputed. Leonardo da Vinci later tried to build it himself according to the description, but failed. However, in 1981 engineer Andre Sleeswyk built his own replica, replacing the square-toothed gear designs of da Vinci with the triangular, pointed teeth found in the Antikythera mechanism. With this modification, the Vitruvius odometer functioned perfectly. = Imperial China = A Han Dynasty stone rubbing of a horse-drawn odometer cart.  Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms period  The odometer was also independently invented in ancient China, possibly by the prolific inventor and early scientist Zhang Heng (78 AD ‚Äì 139 AD) of the Han Dynasty. By the 3rd century (during the Three Kingdoms Period), the Chinese had termed the device as the 'j√¨ lƒ≠ g≈≠ chƒì' (Ë®òÈáåÈºìËªä), or 'li-recording drum carriage' (Note: the modern measurement of li = ). Chinese texts of the 3rd century tell of the mechanical carriage's functions, and as one li is traversed, a mechanical-driven wooden figure strikes a drum, and when ten li is traversed, another wooden figure would strike a gong or a bell with its mechanical-operated arm. Despite its association with Zhang Heng or even the later Ma Jun (c. 200‚Äì265), there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered around the huang men court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) that would follow the musical procession of the royal 'drum-chariot'. The historian Joseph Needham asserts that it is no surprise this social group would have been responsible for such a device, since there is already other evidence of their craftsmanship with mechanical toys to delight the emperor and the court. There is speculation that some time in the 1st century BC (during the Western Han Dynasty), the beating of drums and gongs were mechanically-driven by working automatically off the rotation of the road- wheels. This might have actually been the design of one Loxia Hong (c. 110 BC), yet by 125 AD the mechanical odometer carriage in China was already known (depicted in a mural of the Xiaotangshan Tomb). The odometer was used also in subsequent periods of Chinese history. In the historical text of the Jin Shu (635 AD), the oldest part of the compiled text, the book known as the Cui Bao (c. 300 AD), recorded the use of the odometer, providing description (attributing it to the Western Han era, from 202 BC‚Äì9 AD). The passage in the Jin Shu expanded upon this, explaining that it took a similar form to the mechanical device of the south-pointing chariot invented by Ma Jun (200‚Äì265, see also differential gear). As recorded in the Song Shi of the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD), the odometer and south-pointing chariot were combined into one wheeled device by engineers of the 9th century, 11th century, and 12th century. The Sunzi Suanjing (Master Sun's Mathematical Manual), dated from the 3rd century to 5th century, presented a mathematical problem for students involving the odometer. It involved a given distance between two cities, the small distance needed for one rotation of the carriage's wheel, and the posed question of how many rotations the wheels would have in all if the carriage was to travel between point A and B.  Song Dynasty  The historical text of the Song Shi (1345 AD), recording the people and events of the Chinese Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279), also mentioned the odometer used in that period. However, unlike written sources of earlier periods, it provided a much more thoroughly detailed description of the device that harkens back to its ancient form (Wade-Giles spelling): > The odometer. [The mile-measuring carriage] is painted red, with pictures of > flowers and birds on the four sides, and constructed in two storeys, > handsomely adorned with carvings.

The escort was formerly of 18 men, but in the 4th year of the Yung- > Hsi reign-period (987 AD) the emperor Thai Tsung increased it to 30. In the > 5th year of the Thien-Sheng reign-period (1027 AD) the Chief Chamberlain Lu > Tao-lung presented specifications for the construction of odometers as > follows: What follows is a long dissertation made by the Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong on the ranging measurements and sizes of wheels and gears, along with a concluding description at the end of how the device ultimately functions: > The vehicle should have a single pole and two wheels.

[Note: the measurement of the Chinese-mile unit, the li, was changed over time, as the li in Song times differed from the length of a li in Han times.] > The vehicle wheel (li lun) is attached to the left road-wheel; it has a > diameter of 1.38 ft with a circumference of 4.14 ft, and has 18 cogs (chhih) > 2.3 inches apart.

Odometers were first developed in the 1600s for wagons and other horse-drawn vehicles in order to measure distances traveled. Levinus Hulsius published the odometer in 1604 in his work Gr√ºndtliche Beschreibung de√ü Diensthafften und Nutzbahrn Instruments Viatorii oder Wegz√§hlers, So zu Fu√ü, zu Pferdt unnd zu Fu√üen gebraucht werden kann, damit mit geringer m√ºhe zu wissen, wie weit man gegangen, geritten, oder gefahren sey: als auch zu erfahren, ohne messen oder zehlen, wie weit von einem Orth zum andern. Daneben wird auch der grosse verborgene Wegweiser angezeiget und vermeldet. In 1645, the French mathematician Blaise Pascal invented the pascaline. Though not an odometer, the pascaline utilized gears to compute measurements. Each gear contained 10 teeth. The first gear advanced the next gear one position when moved one complete revolution, the same principle employed on modern mechanical odometers. Odometers were developed for ships in 1698 with the odometer invented by the Englishman Thomas Savery. Benjamin Franklin, U.S. statesman and the first Postmaster General, built a prototype odometer in 1775 that he attached to his carriage to help measure the mileage of postal routes. In 1847, William Clayton, a Mormon pioneer, invented the Roadometer, which he attached to a wagon used by American settlers heading west. The Roadometer recorded the distance traveled each day by the wagon trains. The Roadometer used two gears and was an early example of an odometer with pascaline-style gears in actual use. In 1895, Curtis Hussey Veeder invented the Cyclometer. The Cyclometer was a mechanical device that counted the number of rotations of a bicycle wheel. A flexible cable transmitted the number of rotations of the wheel to an analog odometer visible to the rider, which converted the wheel rotations into the number of miles traveled according to a predetermined formula. In 1903 Arthur P. and Charles H. Warner, two brothers from Beloit, Wisconsin, introduced their patented Auto-meter. The Auto-Meter used a magnet attached to a rotating shaft to induce a magnetic pull upon a thin metal disk. Measuring this pull provided accurate measurements of both distance and speed information to automobile drivers in a single instrument. The Warners sold their company in 1912 to the Stewart & Clark Company of Chicago. The new firm was renamed the Stewart-Warner Corporation. By 1925, Stewart-Warner odometers and trip meters were standard equipment on the vast majority of automobiles and motorcycles manufactured in the United States. By the early 2000s, mechanical odometers would be phased out on cars from major manufacturers. The Pontiac Grand Prix was the last GM car sold in the US to offer a mechanical odometer in 2003, the Canadian-built Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis were the very last Fords sold with one in 2005.  Trip meters  After reaching the maximum reading, an odometer or trip meter restarts from zero, called odometer rollover. Digital odometers may not rollover. Most modern cars include a trip meter (trip odometer). Unlike the odometer, a trip meter is reset at any point in a journey, making it possible to record the distance traveled in any particular journey or part of a journey. It was traditionally a purely mechanical device but, in most modern vehicles, it is now electronic. Luxury vehicles often have multiple trip meters. Most trip meters will show a maximum value of 999.9. The trip meter may be used to record the distance traveled on each tank of fuel, making it very easy to accurately track the energy efficiency of the vehicle; another common use is resetting it to zero at each instruction in a sequence of driving directions, to be sure when one has arrived at the next turn.  Clocking/busting miles and legality  A form of fraud is to tamper with the reading on an odometer and presenting the incorrect number of miles/kilometres traveled to a prospective buyer; this is often referred to as \\"clocking\\" in the UK and \\"busting miles\\" in the US. This is done to make a car appear to have been driven less than it really has been, and thus increase its apparent market value. Most new cars sold today use digital odometers that store the mileage in the vehicle's engine control module making it difficult (but not impossible) to manipulate the mileage electronically. With mechanical odometers, the speedometer can be removed from the car dashboard and the digits wound back, or the drive cable can be disconnected and connected to another odometer/speedometer pair while on the road. Older vehicles can be driven in reverse to subtract mileage, a concept which provides the premise for a classic scene in the comedy film Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but modern odometers add mileage driven in reverse to the total as if driven forward, thereby accurately reflecting the true total wear and tear on the vehicle. The resale value of a vehicle is often strongly influenced by the total distance shown on the odometer, yet odometers are inherently insecure because they are under the control of their owners. Many jurisdictions have chosen to enact laws which penalize people who are found to commit odometer fraud. In the US (and many other countries), vehicle mechanics are also required to keep records of the odometer any time a vehicle is serviced. Companies such as Carfax then use these data to help potential car buyers detect whether odometer rollback has occurred. = Prevalence = Research by Irish vehicle check specialist Cartell found that 20% of vehicles imported to Ireland from Great Britain and Northern Ireland had had their mileometers altered to show a lower mileage.  Accuracy  Most odometers work by counting wheel rotations and assume that the distance traveled is the number of wheel rotations times the tire circumference, which is a standard tire diameter times pi (3.1416). If nonstandard or severely worn or underinflated tires are used then this will cause some error in the odometer.

Biography L'attraction des montagnes, 1814 Zach studied physics at the Royal University of Pest, and served for some time in the Austrian army. He taught at the University of Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine). He lived in Paris in 1780‚Äì83, and in London from 1783 to 1786 as tutor in the house of the Saxon ambassador, Hans Moritz von Br√ºhl. In Paris and London he entered the circles of astronomers like Joseph de Lalande, Pierre-Simon Laplace and William Herschel. In 1786 he was appointed by Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg director of the new observatory on Seeberg hill at Gotha, which was finished in 1791. At the close of the 18th century, he organised the \\"Celestial Police\\", a group of twenty-four astronomers, to prepare for a systematic search for the \\"missing planet\\" predicted by the Titius-Bode law between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres was discovered by accident just as the search was getting underway. Using predictions made of the position of Ceres by Carl Friedrich Gauss, on 31 December 1801/1 January 1802, Zach (and, independently one night later, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers) recovered Ceres after it was lost during its passage behind the Sun. After the death of the duke in 1804, Zach accompanied the duke's widow on her travels in the south of Europe, and the two settled in Genoa in 1815 where he directed an observatory. He moved back to Paris in 1827 and died there in 1832. Zach published Tables of the Sun (Gotha, 1792; new and improved edition, Gotha, 1804), and numerous papers on geographical subjects, particularly on the geographical positions of many towns and places, which he determined on his travels with a sextant. His principal importance was, however, as editor of three scientific journals of great value: Allgemeine Geographische Ephemeriden (4 vols., Gotha, 1798‚Äì1799), Monatliche Correspondenz zur Bef√∂rderung der Erd- und Himmels-Kunde (28 vols., Gotha, 1800‚Äì1813, from 1807 edited by Bernhard von Lindenau), and ' (Genoa, 1818‚Äì1826, 14 vols., and one number of the 15th, the suppression of which was instigated by the Jesuits). He was elected as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1794, a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1798, a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1804, and an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1832. In 1808, von Zach was in Marseille where he observed and explained the phenomenon of the Canigou mountain in eastern Pyr√©n√©es which can be seen twice a year from there, 250 km away, by refraction of light. Asteroid 999 Zachia and the crater Zach on the Moon are named after him, while asteroid 64 Angelina is named after an astronomical station he set up near Marseille.

It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieve organisational objectives by making the best use of knowledge. An established discipline since 1991, KM includes courses taught in the fields of business administration, information systems, management, library, and information sciences. Other fields may contribute to KM research, including information and media, computer science, public health and public policy. Several universities offer dedicated master's degrees in knowledge management. Many large companies, public institutions and non-profit organisations have resources dedicated to internal KM efforts, often as a part of their business strategy, IT, or human resource management departments. Several consulting companies provide advice regarding KM to these organizations. Knowledge management efforts typically focus on organisational objectives such as improved performance, competitive advantage, innovation, the sharing of lessons learned, integration and continuous improvement of the organisation. These efforts overlap with organisational learning and may be distinguished from that by a greater focus on the management of knowledge as a strategic asset and on encouraging the sharing of knowledge. KM is an enabler of organizational learning.Sanchez, R (1996) Strategic Learning and Knowledge Management, Wiley, Chichester History Knowledge management efforts have a long history, including on-the-job discussions, formal apprenticeship, discussion forums, corporate libraries, professional training, and mentoring programs. With increased use of computers in the second half of the 20th century, specific adaptations of technologies such as knowledge bases, expert systems, information repositories, group decision support systems, intranets, and computer-supported cooperative work have been introduced to further enhance such efforts. In 1999, the term personal knowledge management was introduced; it refers to the management of knowledge at the individual level. In the enterprise, early collections of case studies recognised the importance of knowledge management dimensions of strategy, process and measurement. Key lessons learned include people and the cultural norms which influence their behaviors are the most critical resources for successful knowledge creation, dissemination and application; cognitive, social and organisational learning processes are essential to the success of a knowledge management strategy; and measurement, benchmarking and incentives are essential to accelerate the learning process and to drive cultural change. In short, knowledge management programs can yield impressive benefits to individuals and organisations if they are purposeful, concrete and action-orientated. Research KM emerged as a scientific discipline in the early 1990s. It was initially supported by individual practitioners, when Skandia hired Leif Edvinsson of Sweden as the world's first Chief Knowledge Officer (CKO). Hubert Saint-Onge (formerly of CIBC, Canada), started investigating KM long before that. The objective of CKOs is to manage and maximise the intangible assets of their organizations. Gradually, CKOs became interested in practical and theoretical aspects of KM, and the new research field was formed. The KM idea has been taken up by academics, such as Ikujiro Nonaka (Hitotsubashi University), Hirotaka Takeuchi (Hitotsubashi University), Thomas H. Davenport (Babson College) and Baruch Lev (New York University). In 2001, Thomas A. Stewart, former editor at Fortune magazine and subsequently the editor of Harvard Business Review, published a cover story highlighting the importance of intellectual capital in organizations. The KM discipline has been gradually moving towards academic maturity. First, is a trend toward higher cooperation among academics; single- author publications are less common. Second, the role of practitioners has changed. Their contribution to academic research declined from 30% of overall contributions up to 2002, to only 10% by 2009. Third, the number of academic knowledge management journals has been steadily growing, currently reaching 27 outlets. Multiple KM disciplines exist; approaches vary by author and school. As the discipline matured, academic debates increased regarding theory and practice, including: * Techno-centric with a focus on technology, ideally those that enhance knowledge sharing and creation. * Organisational with a focus on how an organisation can be designed to facilitate knowledge processes best. * Ecological with a focus on the interaction of people, identity, knowledge, and environmental factors as a complex adaptive system akin to a natural ecosystem. Regardless of the school of thought, core components of KM roughly include people/culture, processes/structure and technology. The details depend on the perspective. KM perspectives include: * community of practice * social network analysis * intellectual capital * information theory * complexity science * constructivism The practical relevance of academic research in KM has been questioned with action research suggested as having more relevance and the need to translate the findings presented in academic journals to a practice. =Dimensions= Different frameworks for distinguishing between different 'types of' knowledge exist. One proposed framework for categorising the dimensions of knowledge distinguishes tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge represents internalised knowledge that an individual may not be consciously aware of, such as to accomplish particular tasks. At the opposite end of the spectrum, explicit knowledge represents knowledge that the individual holds consciously in mental focus, in a form that can easily be communicated to others. The Knowledge Spiral as described by Nonaka & Takeuchi. Ikujiro Nonaka proposed a model (SECI, for Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination, Internalisation) which considers a spiraling interaction between explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge. In this model, knowledge follows a cycle in which implicit knowledge is 'extracted' to become explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is 're-internalised' into implicit knowledge. Hayes and Walsham (2003) describe knowledge and knowledge management as two different perspectives. The content perspective suggests that knowledge is easily stored; because it may be codified, while the relational perspective recognises the contextual and relational aspects of knowledge which can make knowledge difficult to share outside the specific context in which it is developed. Early research suggested that KM needs to convert internalised tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge to share it, and the same effort must permit individuals to internalise and make personally meaningful any codified knowledge retrieved from the KM effort. Subsequent research suggested that a distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge represented an oversimplification and that the notion of explicit knowledge is self-contradictory. Specifically, for knowledge to be made explicit, it must be translated into information (i.e., symbols outside our heads). More recently, together with Georg von Krogh and Sven Voelpel, Nonaka returned to his earlier work in an attempt to move the debate about knowledge conversion forward. A second proposed framework for categorising knowledge dimensions distinguishes embedded knowledge of a system outside a human individual (e.g., an information system may have knowledge embedded into its design) from embodied knowledge representing a learned capability of a human body's nervous and endocrine systems. A third proposed framework distinguishes between the exploratory creation of \\"new knowledge\\" (i.e., innovation) vs. the transfer or exploitation of \\"established knowledge\\" within a group, organisation, or community. Collaborative environments such as communities of practice or the use of social computing tools can be used for both knowledge creation and transfer. =Strategies= Knowledge may be accessed at three stages: before, during, or after KM-related activities. Organisations have tried knowledge capture incentives, including making content submission mandatory and incorporating rewards into performance measurement plans. Considerable controversy exists over whether such incentives work and no consensus has emerged. One strategy to KM involves actively managing knowledge (push strategy). In such an instance, individuals strive to explicitly encode their knowledge into a shared knowledge repository, such as a database, as well as retrieving knowledge they need that other individuals have provided (codification). Another strategy involves individuals making knowledge requests of experts associated with a particular subject on an ad hoc basis (pull strategy). In such an instance, expert individual(s) provide insights to requestor (personalisation). Hansen et al. defined the two strategies.Hansen et al., 1999 Codification focuses on collecting and storing codified knowledge in electronic databases to make it accessible.Smith (2004), p. 7 Codification can therefore refer to both tacit and explicit knowledge.Hall (2006), pp. 119f In contrast, personalisation encourages individuals to share their knowledge directly. Information technology plays a less important role, as it is only facilitates communication and knowledge sharing. Other knowledge management strategies and instruments for companies include: * Knowledge sharing (fostering a culture that encourages the sharing of information, based on the concept that knowledge is not irrevocable and should be shared and updated to remain relevant)  Make knowledge-sharing a key role in employees' job description  Inter-project knowledge transfer  Intra-organisational knowledge sharing  Inter-organisational knowledge sharing * Knowledge retention also known as Knowledge Continuation: activiities addressing the challenge of knowledge loss as a result of people leavingLiebowitz, J.

Typical considerations include: * Making available increased knowledge content in the development and provision of products and services * Achieving shorter development cycles * Facilitating and managing innovation and organisational learning * Leveraging expertises across the organisation * Increasing network connectivity between internal and external individuals * Managing business environments and allowing employees to obtain relevant insights and ideas appropriate to their work * Solving intractable or wicked problems * Managing intellectual capital and assets in the workforce (such as the expertise and know-how possessed by key individuals or stored in repositories) KM technologies Knowledge management (KM) technology can be categorised: * Groupware‚ÄîSoftware that facilitates collaboration and sharing of organisational information. Such applications provide tools for threaded discussions, document sharing, organisation-wide uniform email, and other collaboration-related features. * Workflow systems‚ÄîSystems that allow the representation of processes associated with the creation, use and maintenance of organisational knowledge, such as the process to create and utilise forms and documents. * Content management and document management systems‚ÄîSoftware systems that automate the process of creating web content and/or documents. Roles such as editors, graphic designers, writers and producers can be explicitly modeled along with the tasks in the process and validation criteria. Commercial vendors started either to support documents or to support web content but as the Internet grew these functions merged and vendors now perform both functions. * Enterprise portals‚ÄîSoftware that aggregates information across the entire organisation or for groups such as project teams. * eLearning‚ÄîSoftware that enables organisations to create customised training and education. This can include lesson plans, monitoring progress and online classes. * Planning and scheduling software‚ÄîSoftware that automates schedule creation and maintenance. The planning aspect can integrate with project management software. * Telepresence‚ÄîSoftware that enables individuals to have virtual \\"face-to-face\\" meetings without assembling at one location. Videoconferencing is the most obvious example. * Semantic technology such as ontologies‚ÄîSystems that encode meaning alongside data to give machines the ability to extract and infer information. These categories overlap. Workflow, for example, is a significant aspect of a content or document management systems, most of which have tools for developing enterprise portals. Proprietary KM technology products such as Lotus Notes defined proprietary formats for email, documents, forms, etc. The Internet drove most vendors to adopt Internet formats. Open-source and freeware tools for the creation of blogs and wikis now enable capabilities that used to require expensive commercial tools. KM is driving the adoption of tools that enable organisations to work at the semantic level, as part of the Semantic Web. Some commentators have argued that after many years the Semantic Web has failed to see widespread adoption, while other commentators have argued that it has been a success.  Knowledge barriers  Just like knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing, the term \\"knowledge barriers\\" is not a uniformly defined term and differs in its meaning depending on the author.Paulin, D., & Suneson, K.

That definition assumes a positive time value of money. It does not make periodic interest payments or have so-called coupons, hence the term zero coupon bond. When the bond reaches maturity, its investor receives its par (or face) value. Examples of zero-coupon bonds include US Treasury bills, US savings bonds, long-term zero-coupon bonds, and any type of coupon bond that has been stripped of its coupons. Zero coupon and deep discount bonds are terms that are used interchangeably. In contrast, an investor who has a regular bond receives income from coupon payments, which are made semi-annually or annually. The investor also receives the principal or face value of the investment when the bond matures. Some zero coupon bonds are inflation indexed, and the amount of money that will be paid to the bond holder is calculated to have a set amount of purchasing power, rather than a set amount of money, but most zero coupon bonds pay a set amount of money known as the face value of the bond. Zero coupon bonds may be long or short term investments. Long-term zero coupon maturity dates typically start at ten to fifteen years. The bonds can be held until maturity or sold on secondary bond markets. Short-term zero coupon bonds generally have maturities of less than one year and are called bills. The US Treasury bill market is the most active and liquid debt market in the world. Strip bonds Zero coupon bonds have a duration equal to the bond's time to maturity, which makes them sensitive to any changes in the interest rates. Investment banks or dealers may separate coupons from the principal of coupon bonds, which is known as the residue, so that different investors may receive the principal and each of the coupon payments. That creates a supply of new zero coupon bonds. The coupons and residue are sold separately to investors. Each of the investments then pays a single lump sum. That method of creating zero coupon bonds is known as stripping, and the contracts are known as strip bonds. \\"STRIPS\\" stands for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities. Dealers normally purchase a block of high-quality and non-callable bonds, often government issues, to create strip bonds. A strip bond has no reinvestment risk because the payment to the investor occurs only at maturity. The impact of interest rate fluctuations on strip bonds, known as the bond duration, is higher than for a coupon bond. A zero coupon bond always has a duration equal to its maturity, and a coupon bond always has a lower duration. Strip bonds are normally available from investment dealers maturing at terms up to 30 years. For some Canadian bonds, the maturity may be over 90 years. In Canada, investors may purchase packages of strip bonds, so that the cash flows are tailored to meet their needs in a single security. These packages may consist of a combination of interest (coupon) and/or principal strips. In New Zealand, bonds are stripped first into two pieces‚Äîthe coupons and the principal. The coupons may be traded as a unit or further subdivided into the individual payment dates. In most countries, strip bonds are primarily administered by a central bank or central securities depository. An alternative form is to use a custodian bank or trust company to hold the underlying security and a transfer agent/registrar to track ownership in the strip bonds and to administer the program. Physically created strip bonds (where the coupons are physically clipped and then traded separately) were created in the early days of stripping in Canada and the U.S., but have virtually disappeared due to the high costs and risks associated with them. 1969 $100K Treasury Bill Uses Pension funds and insurance companies like to own long maturity zero coupon bonds because of their high duration. That means that the bonds' prices are particularly sensitive to changes in the interest rate, and so offset, or immunize, the interest rate risk of the firms' long-term liabilities. Taxes In the United States, a zero-l coupon bond has original issue discount (OID) for tax purposes. Instruments issued with OID generally impute the receipt of interest, sometimes called phantom income, even though the bonds do not pay periodic interest. Therefore, zero coupon bonds subject to US taxation should generally be held in tax-deferred retirement accounts, to avoid taxes being paid on future income. Alternatively, when a zero coupon bond issued by a US state or local government entity is purchased, the imputed interest is free of U.S. federal taxes and, in most cases, state and local taxes. Zero coupon bonds were first introduced in the 1960s but did not become popular until the 1980s. The use of such instruments was aided by an anomaly in the US tax system, which allowed for deduction of the discount on bonds relative to their par value. The rule ignored the compounding of interest and led to significant tax-savings when the interest is high or the security has long maturity. Although the tax loopholes were closed quickly, the bonds themselves have remained desirable because of their simplicity. In India, the tax on income from deep discount bonds can arise in two ways: interest or capital gains. It is also a law that interest has to be shown on an accrual basis for deep discount bonds issued after February 2002, as per CBDT circular No 2 of 2002, dated 15 February 2002.

Panoramic paintings are massive artworks that reveal a wide, all-encompassing view of a particular subject, often a landscape, military battle, or historical event. They became especially popular in the 19th century in Europe and the United States, inciting opposition from some writers of Romantic poetry. A few have survived into the 21st century and are on public display. In China, panoramic paintings are an important subset of handscroll paintings, with some famous examples being Along the River During the Qingming Festival and Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River. History The word \\"panorama\\", from Greek pan (\\"all\\") horama (\\"view\\") was coined by the Irish painter Robert Barker in 1792 to describe his paintings of Edinburgh, Scotland shown on a cylindrical surface, which he soon was exhibiting in London, as \\"The Panorama\\". Robert Mitchell's diagram illustrating the Leicester Square Rotunda, in which was exhibited the Panorama, 1801 (annotated adaptation) Annotated Video Tour of Robert Barker's Panorama of London in November 1790 In 1793 Barker moved his panoramas to the first purpose-built brick panorama rotunda building in the world, in Leicester Square, and made a fortune. Viewers flocked to pay a stiff 3 shillings to stand on a central platform under a skylight, which offered an even lighting, and get an experience that was \\"panoramic\\" (an adjective that didn't appear in print until 1813). The extended meaning of a \\"comprehensive survey\\" of a subject followed sooner, in 1801. Visitors to Barker's Panorama of London, painted as if viewed from the roof of Albion Mills on the South Bank, could purchase a series of six prints that modestly recalled the experience; end-to-end the prints stretched 3.25 metres. In contrast, the actual panorama spanned 250 square metres.Comment 1999, p. 23 Despite the success of Barker's first panorama in Leicester Square, it was neither his first attempt at the craft nor his first exhibition. In 1788 Barker showcased his first panorama. It was only a semi-circular view of Edinburgh, Scotland, and Barker's inability to bring the image to a full 360 degrees disappointed him. To realize his true vision, Barker and his son, Henry Aston Barker, took on the task of painting a scene of the Albion Mills. The first version of what was to be Barker's first successful panorama was displayed in a purpose-built wooden rotunda in the back garden of the Barker home and measured only 137 square metres. Barker's accomplishment involved sophisticated manipulations of perspective not encountered in the panorama's predecessors, the wide-angle \\"prospect\\" of a city familiar since the 16th century, or Wenceslas Hollar's Long View of London from Bankside, etched on several contiguous sheets. When Barker first patented his technique in 1787, he had given it a French title: La Nature √† Coup d' Oeil (\\"Nature at a glance\\"). A sensibility to the \\"picturesque\\" was developing among the educated class, and as they toured picturesque districts, like the Lake District, they might have in the carriage with them a large lens set in a picture frame, a \\"landscape glass\\" that would contract a wide view into a \\"picture\\" when held at arm's length. Barker made many efforts to increase the realism of his scenes. To fully immerse the audience in the scene, all borders of the canvas were concealed.Ellis 2008, p. 144 Props were also strategically positioned on the platform where the audience stood and two windows were laid into the roof to allow natural light to flood the canvases.Comment 1999, p. 7-8 Two scenes could be exhibited in the rotunda simultaneously, however the rotunda at Leicester Square was the only one to do so.Comment 1999, p. 24 Houses with single scenes proved more popular to audiences as the fame of the panorama spread. Because the Leicester Square rotunda housed two panoramas, Barker needed a mechanism to clear the minds of the audience as they moved from one panorama to the other. To accomplish this, patrons walked down a dark corridor and up a long flight of stairs where their minds were supposed to be refreshed for viewing the new scene.Thomas 2005, p. 10 Due to the immense size of the panorama, patrons were given orientation plans to help them navigate the scene.Comment 1999, p. 161 These glorified maps pinpointed key buildings, sites, or events exhibited on the canvas. Detail from Bird's Eye View from the Staircase & the Upper Part of the Pavilion in the Colosseum, Regent's Park (1829), a coloured aquatint by Rudolph Ackermann. Sometimes the viewing position was physically recreated in the panorama's rotunda. The distant image of London shown here is the painted backdrop of the panorama. To create a panorama, artists travelled to the sites and sketched the scenes multiple times.Comment 1999, p. 182 Typically a team of artists worked on one project with each team specializing in a certain aspect of the painting such as landscapes, people or skies. After completing their sketches, the artists typically consulted other paintings, of average size, to add further detail. Martin Meisel described the panorama: \\"In its impact, the Panorama was a comprehensive form, the representation not of the segment of a world, but of a world entire seen from a focal height.\\"Meisel 1983, p. 62 Though the artists painstakingly documented every detail of a scene, by doing so they created a world complete in and of itself.Thomas 2005, p. 14 The first panoramas depicted urban settings, such as cities, while later panoramas depicted nature and famous military battles.Comment 1999, pp. 23‚Äì25 The necessity for military scenes increased in part because so many were taking place. French battles commonly found their way to rotundas thanks to the feisty leadership of Napoleon Bonaparte. Henry Aston Barker's travels to France during the Peace of Amiens led him to court, where Bonaparte accepted him. Henry Aston created panoramas of Bonaparte's battles including The Battle of Waterloo, which saw so much success that he retired after finishing it.Comment 1999, p. 25 Henry Aston's relationship with Bonaparte continued following Bonaparte's exile to Elba, where Henry Aston visited the former emperor. Pierre Pr√©vost (painter) (1764‚Äì1823) was the first important French panorama painter. Among his 17 panoramas, the most famous describe the cities of Rome, Naples, Amsterdam, Jerusalem, Athens and also the battle of Wagram. Outside of England and France, the popularity of panoramas depended on the type of scene displayed. Typically, people wanted to see images from their own countries or from England. This principle rang true in Switzerland, where views of the Alps dominated.Comment 1999, p. 53 Likewise in America, New York City panoramas found popularity, as well as imports from Barker's rotunda.Comment 1999, p. 55-56 As painter John Vanderlyn soon found out, French politics did not interest Americans.Comment 1999, p. 56 In particular, his depiction of Louis XVIII's return to the throne did not live two months in the rotunda before a new panorama took its place. Raevsky Battery at Borodino, a fragment of Roubaud's panoramic painting Barker's Panorama was hugely successful and spawned a series of \\"immersive\\" panoramas: the Museum of London's curators found mention of 126 panoramas that were exhibited between 1793 and 1863. In Europe, panoramas were created of historical events and battles, notably by the Russian painter Franz Roubaud. Most major European cities featured more than one purpose-built structure hosting panoramas. These large fixed-circle panoramas declined in popularity in the latter third of the nineteenth century, though in the United States they experienced a partial revival; in this period, they were more commonly referred to as cycloramas. The panorama competed for audiences most frequently with the diorama, a slightly curved or flat canvas extending 22 by 14 metres.Comment 1999, p. 57 The diorama was invented in 1822 by Louis Daguerre and Charles-Marie Bouton, the latter a former student of the renowned French painter Jacques-Louis David. Unlike the panorama where spectators had to move to view the scene, the scenes on the diorama moved so the audience could remain seated.Comment 1999, p. 58 Accomplished with four screens on a roundabout, the illusion captivated 350 spectators at a time for a period of 15 minutes. The images rotated in a 73 degree arc, focusing on two of the four scenes while the remaining two were prepared, which allowed the canvases to be refreshed throughout the course of the show. While topographical detail was crucial to panoramas, as evidenced by the teams of artists who worked on them, the effect of the illusion took precedence with the diorama.Thomas 2005, p. 11 Painters of the diorama also added their own twist to the panorama's props, but instead of props to make the scenes more real, they incorporated sounds. Another similarity to the panorama was the effect the diorama had on its audience. Some patrons experienced a stupor, while others were alienated by the spectacle.Thomas 2005, p. 12-13 The alienation of the diorama was caused by the connection the scene drew to art, nature and death.Thomas 2005, p. 13-14 After Daguerre and Bouton's first exhibition in London, one reviewer noted a stillness like that \\"of the grave.\\" To remedy this tomblike atmosphere Daguerre painted both sides of the canvas, known as \\"the double effect.\\" By lighting both painted sides of the canvas, light was transmitted and reflected producing a type of transparency producing the effect of time passing. This effect gave the crew operating the lights and turning the roundabout a new type of control over the audience than the panorama ever had. In Britain and particularly in the US, the panoramic ideal was intensified by unrolling a canvas-backed scroll past the viewer in a Moving Panorama, an alteration of an idea that was familiar in the hand-held landscape scrolls of Song dynasty. First unveiled in 1809 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the moving panorama required a large canvas and two vertical rollers to be set up on a stage.Wilcox 2007, p. 2 Peter Marshall added the twist to Barker's original creation, which saw success throughout the 19th and into the 20th century. The scene or variation of scenes passed between the rollers, eliminating the need to showcase and view the panorama in a rotunda. A precursor to \\"moving\\" pictures, the moving panorama incorporated music, sound effects and stand-alone cut-outs to create their mobile effect. Such a traveling motion allowed for new types of scenes, such as chase sequences, that could not be produced so well in either the diorama or the panorama.Meisel, 1983, p. 62 In contrast specifically to the diorama, where the audience seemed to be physically rotated, the moving panorama gave patrons a new perspective, allowing them to \\"[function] as a moving eye\\". Romantic criticism of panoramas The panorama's rise in popularity was a result of its accessibility in that people did not need a certain level of education to enjoy the views it offered.Ellis 2008, p. 142 Accordingly, patrons from across the social scale flocked to rotundas throughout Europe. While easy access was an attraction of the panorama, some people believed it was nothing more than a parlor trick bent on deceiving its public audience. Designed to have a lingering effect upon the viewer, the panorama was placed in the same category as propaganda of the period, which was also seen as deceitful.Thomas 2005, p. 20 The locality paradox also attributed to the arguments of panorama critics. A phenomenon resulting from immersion in a panorama, the locality paradox happened when people were unable to distinguish where they were: in the rotunda or at the scene they were seeing. Writers feared the panorama for the simplicity of its illusion. Hester Piozzi was among those who rebelled against the growing popularity of the panorama for precisely this reason. She did not like seeing so many people ‚Äì elite and otherwise ‚Äì fooled by something so simple. Another problem with the panorama was what it came to be associated with, namely, by redefining the sublime to incorporate the material.Jones 2006, p. 360 In their earliest forms, panoramas depicted topographical scenes and in so doing, made the sublime accessible to every person with 3 shillings in his or her pocket.Wilcox 2007, p. 1 The sublime became an everyday thing and therefore, a material commodity. By associating the sublime with the material, the panorama was seen as a threat to romanticism, which was obsessed with the sublime.Jones 2006, p.360 According to the romantics, the sublime was never supposed to include materiality and by linking the two, panoramas tainted the sublime. The poet William Wordsworth has long been characterized as an opponent of the panorama, most notably for his allusion to it in Book Seven of The Prelude.Ellis 2008, p. 145 It has been argued that Wordsworth's problem with the panorama was the deceit it used to gain popularity.Haut 2009, p. 314 He felt, critics say, that the panorama not only exhibited an immense scene of some kind, but also the weakness of human intelligence. Wordsworth was offended by the fact that so many people found panoramas irresistible and concluded that people were not smart enough to see through the charade. Because of his argument in \\"The Prelude,\\" it is safe to assume Wordsworth saw a panorama at some point during his life, but it is unknown which one he saw; there is no substantial proof he ever went, other than his description in the poem.Jones 2006, p. 364 However, Wordsworth's hatred of the panorama was not limited to its deceit. The panorama's association with the sublime was likewise offensive to the poet as were other spectacles of the period that competed with reality.Miles 2005, p. 14 As a poet, Wordsworth sought to separate his craft from the phantasmagoria enveloping the population.Miles 2005, p. 18 In this context, phantasmagoria refers to signs and other circulated propaganda, including billboards, illustrated newspapers and panoramas themselves.Miles 2005, pp. 14‚Äì15 Wordsworth's biggest problem with panoramas was their pretense: the panorama lulled spectators into stupors, inhibiting their ability to imagine things for themselves. Wordsworth wanted people to see the representation depicted in the panorama and appreciate it for what it was ‚Äì art. Conversely, some critics argue Wordsworth was not opposed to the panorama, but was rather hesitant about it. A main argument is that other episodes in The Prelude have just as much sensory depth as panoramas had.Jones 2006, p. 366-367 Such depth could only be accomplished through imitation of the human senses, something both the panorama and The Prelude succeed at. Therefore, since both the panorama and The Prelude imitate the senses, they are equal and suggest Wordsworth was not entirely opposed to panoramas. A modern take on the panorama believes the enormous paintings filled a hole in the lives of those who lived during the nineteenth century.Comment 1999, p. 19 Bernard Comment said in his book The Painted Panorama, that the masses needed \\"absolute dominance\\" and the illusion offered by the panorama gave them a sense of organization and control. Despite the power it wielded, the panorama detached audiences from the scene they viewed, replacing reality and encouraging them to watch the world rather than experience it. Surviving panoramas Relatively few of these unwieldy ephemera survive. The oldest known surviving panorama (completed in 1814 by Marquard Wocher) is on display at Schadau Castle, depicting an average morning in the Swiss town of Thun. As of today it is owned by the Gottfried Keller Foundation. Another rare surviving great-circle panorama is the Panorama Mesdag, completed in 1881 and housed in a purpose-built museum in The Hague, showing the dunes of nearby Scheveningen. Both of these works are considered of interest as they depict domestic scenes of their times. Depictions of warfare were more common as subject matter, an example of which is located at the battlefield of Waterloo, depicting the battle. An exhibition \\"Panoramania\\" was held at the Barbican in the 1980s, with a catalog by Ralph Hyde. The Rac≈Çawice Panorama, currently located in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, is a monumental (15 √ó 120 metre) panoramic painting depicting the Battle of Rac≈Çawice, during the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising. A panorama of the Battle of Stalingrad is on display at Mamayev Kurgan. Among Franz Roubaud's great panoramas, those depicting the Siege of Sevastopol (1905) and Battle of Borodino (1911) survive, although the former was damaged during the Siege of Sevastopol (1942) and the latter was transferred to Poklonnaya Gora. The Pleven Panorama in Pleven, Bulgaria, depicts the events of the Siege of Plevna in 1877 on a 115√ó15-metre canvas with a 12-meter foreground. Five large panoramas survive in North America: the Cyclorama of Jerusalem (a.k.a. the Panorama of Jerusalem at the Moment of Christ's Death) at St. Anne, outside of Quebec City; the Gettysburg Cyclorama depicting Pickett's Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; John Vanderlyn's Panorama of the Garden and Palace of Versailles at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Atlanta Cyclorama, which depicts the Battle of Atlanta, in Atlanta, Georgia. A fifth panorama, also depicting the Battle of Gettysburg, was willed in 1996 to Wake Forest University in North Carolina; it is in poor condition and not on public display. It was purchased in 2007 by a group of North Carolina investors who hope to resell it to someone willing to restore it. Only pieces survive of a massive cyclorama depicting the Battle of Shiloh. In the area of the moving panorama, there are somewhat more extant, though many are in poor repair and the conservation of such enormous paintings poses very expensive problems. The most notable rediscovered panorama in the United States was the Great Moving Panorama of Pilgrim's Progress, which was found in storage at the York Institute now the Saco Museum in Saco, Maine, by its former curator Tom Hardiman. It was found to incorporate designs by many of the leading painters of its day, including Jasper Francis Cropsey, Frederic Edwin Church, and Henry Courtney Selous (Selous was the in-house painter for the original Barker panorama in London for many years.) The St. Louis Art Museum owns another moving panorama, which it is conserving in public during the summers of 2011 and 2012. \\"The Panorama of the Monumental Grandeur of the Mississippi Valley\\" ‚Äî the only remaining of six known Mississippi River panorama paintings‚Äîmeasures wide by long and was commissioned by an eccentric amateur archaeologist named Montroville W. Dickeson. Judith H. Dobrzynski wrote about the restoration in an article in the Wall Street Journal dated June 27, 2012. In 1918, the New Bedford Whaling Museum acquired the Grand Panorama of a Whaling Voyage Round the World, created by artists Benjamin Russell and Caleb Purrington in 1848. At about long and high, it is one of the largest surviving moving panoramas (although far short of the \\"Three Miles [4800 m] of Canvass\\" advertised by its creators in their handbills). The Museum is currently planning for the conservation of the Grand Panorama. Although in storage, highlights may be seen on the Museum's Flickr pages Another moving panorama was donated to the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection at Brown University Library in 2005. Painted in Nottingham, England around 1860 by John James Story (d. 1900), it depicts the life and career of the great Italian patriot, Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807‚Äì1882). The panorama stands about high and long, painted on both sides in watercolor. Numerous battles and other dramatic events in his life are depicted in 42 scenes, and the original narration written in ink survives. The Arrival of the Hungarians, a vast cyclorama by √Årp√°d Feszty et al., completed in 1894, is displayed at the √ìpusztaszer National Heritage Park in Hungary. It was made to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the 895 conquest of the Carpathian Basin by the Hungarians. The Cyclorama of Early Melbourne, by artist John Hennings in 1892, still survives albeit having suffered water damage during a fire. Painted from a panoramic sketch of Early Melbourne in 1842 by Samuel Jackson. It places the viewer on top of the partially constructed Scott's Church on Collins Street in the Melbourne CBD. Commissioned to celebrate 50 years of the city of Melbourne, it was displayed in the Melbourne Exhibition Building for nearly 30 years before being taken into storage. Relatively small for a Cyclorama, it measured long and high. The Biological museum (Stockholm), founded by hunter and taxidermist Gustaf Kolthoff, opened its dioramas to the public in November 1893 and is still an active museum with about 15000 visitors yearly. The museum has panorama paintings by Bruno Liljefors (assisted by Gustaf Fj√¶stad), Kjell Kolthoff and several hundred preserved animals in their natural habitats.

It is also popularly used by artists as a painting surface, typically stretched across a wooden frame. Modern canvas is usually made of cotton or linen, along with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), although historically it was made from hemp. It differs from other heavy cotton fabrics, such as denim, in being plain weave rather than twill weave. Canvas comes in two basic types: plain and duck. The threads in duck canvas are more tightly woven. The term duck comes from the Dutch word for cloth, doek. In the United States, canvas is classified in two ways: by weight (ounces per square yard) and by a graded number system. The numbers run in reverse of the weight so a number 10 canvas is lighter than number 4. Canvas has become the most common support medium for oil painting, replacing wooden panels. It was used from the 14th century in Italy, but only rarely. One of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a French Madonna with angels from around 1410 in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin. The word \\"canvas\\" is derived from the 13th century Anglo-French canevaz and the Old French canevas. Both may be derivatives of the Vulgar Latin cannapaceus for \\"made of hemp\\", originating from the Greek (cannabis). For painting Canvas on stretcher bar Canvas has become the most common support medium for oil painting, replacing wooden panels. It was used from the 14th century in Italy, but only rarely. One of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a French Madonna with angels from around 1410 in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin. Its use in Saint George and the Dragon by Paolo Uccello in about 1470,Gordon, xiii and Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus in the 1480s was still unusual for the period. Large paintings for country houses were apparently more likely to be on canvas, and are perhaps less likely to have survived. It was a good deal cheaper than a panel painting, and may sometime indicate a painting regarded as less important. In the Uccello, the armour does not use silver leaf, as other of his paintings do (and the colour therefore remains undegraded).Gordon, xv Another common category of paintings on lighter cloth such as linen was in distemper or glue, often used for banners to be carried in procession. This is a less durable medium, and surviving examples such as Dirk Bouts' Entombment, in distemper on linen (1450s, National Gallery) are rare, and often rather faded in appearance. Panel painting remained more common until the 16th century in Italy and the 17th century in Northern Europe. Mantegna and Venetian artists were among those leading the change; Venetian sail canvas was readily available and regarded as the best quality. Canvas stretched on wooden frame Canvas is usually stretched across a wooden frame called a stretcher and maybe coated with gesso prior to being used to prevent oil paint from coming into direct contact with the canvas fibres which would eventually cause the canvas to decay. A traditional and flexible chalk gesso is composed of lead carbonate and linseed oil, applied over a rabbit skin glue ground; a variation using titanium white pigment and calcium carbonate is rather brittle and susceptible to cracking. As lead-based paint is poisonous, care has to be taken in using it. Various alternative and more flexible canvas primers are commercially available, the most popular being a synthetic latex paint composed of titanium dioxide and calcium carbonate, bound with a thermo-plastic emulsion. Many artists have painted onto unprimed canvas, such as Jackson Pollock, Kenneth Noland, Francis Bacon, Helen Frankenthaler, Dan Christensen, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Color Field painters, Lyrical Abstractionists and others. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint. In 1970 artist Helen Frankenthaler commented about her use of staining: > When I first started doing the stain paintings, I left large areas of canvas > unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as > positively as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground was > part of the medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or > negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had > paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to > fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of > colors. It's saying it in space.De Antonio, Emile. Painters Painting, a > Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940‚Äì1970, p. 82, Abbeville Press > 1984, Bleaching-fields covered with sheets of new-made textiles, probably linen, very possibly canvas, 1670s near Haarlem in the Netherlands Early canvas was made of linen, a sturdy brownish fabric of considerable strength. Linen is particularly suitable for the use of oil paint. In the early 20th century, cotton canvas, often referred to as \\"cotton duck\\", came into use. Linen is composed of higher quality material, and remains popular with many professional artists, especially those who work with oil paint. Cotton duck, which stretches more fully and has an even, mechanical weave, offers a more economical alternative. The advent of acrylic paint has greatly increased the popularity and use of cotton duck canvas. Linen and cotton derive from two entirely different plants, the flax plant and the cotton plant, respectively. Gessoed canvases on stretchers are also available. They are available in a variety of weights: light-weight is about or ; medium-weight is about or ; heavy-weight is about or . They are prepared with two or three coats of gesso and are ready for use straight away. Artists desiring greater control of their painting surface may add a coat or two of their preferred gesso. Professional artists who wish to work on canvas may prepare their own canvas in the traditional manner. One of the most outstanding differences between modern painting techniques and those of the Flemish and Dutch Masters is in the preparation of the canvas. \\"Modern\\" techniques take advantage of both the canvas texture as well as those of the paint itself. Renaissance masters took extreme measures to ensure that none of the texture of the canvas came through. This required a painstaking, months-long process of layering the raw canvas with (usually) lead-white paint, then polishing the surface, and then repeating. The final product had little resemblance to fabric, but instead had a glossy, enamel-like finish. With a properly prepared canvas, the painter will find that each subsequent layer of color glides on in a \\"buttery\\" manner, and that with the proper consistency of application (fat over lean technique), a painting entirely devoid of brushstrokes can be achieved. A warm iron is applied over a piece of wet cotton to flatten the wrinkles. Canvas can also be printed on using offset or specialist digital printers to create canvas prints. This process of digital inkjet printing is popularly referred to as Gicl√©e. After printing, the canvas can be wrapped around a stretcher and displayed. For embroidery Canvas is a popular base fabric for embroidery such as cross-stitch and Berlin wool work. Some specific types of embroidery canvases are Aida cloth (also called Java canvas), Penelope canvas, Chess canvas, and Binca canvas. Plastic canvas is a stiffer form of Binca canvas. As a compound agent Canada Post canvas bags Stretching canvas on a canoe From the 13th century onward, canvas was used as a covering layer on Pavise shields. The canvas was applied to the wooden surface of the Pavise, covered with multiple layers of gesso and often richly painted in tempera technique. Finally, the surface was sealed with a transparent varnish. While the gessoed canvas was a perfect painting surface, the primary purpose of the canvas application may have been the strengthening of the wooden shield corpus in a manner similar to modern glass-reinforced plastic. Splined canvas, stretched canvas and canvas boards Splined canvases differ from traditional side- stapled canvas in that canvas is attached with a spline at the rear of the frame. This allows the artist to incorporate painted edges into the artwork itself without staples at the sides, and the artwork can be displayed without a frame. Splined canvas can be restretched by adjusting the spline. Stapled canvases stay stretched tighter over a longer period of time, but are more difficult to re-stretch when the need arises. Canvas boards are made of canvas stretched over and glued to a cardboard backing, and sealed on the backside. The canvas is typically linen primed for a certain type of paint. They are primarily used by artists for quick studies.

The gnomon is a rod that is very narrow, so it functions as the style. The Latin motto loosely translates as \\"I only count the sunny hours.\\" thumbrightA horizontal dial commissioned in 1862, the gnomon is the triangular blade. The style is its inclined edge. A combined analemmatic- equatorial sundial in Ann Morrison Park in Boise, Idaho, 43¬∞36'45.5\\"N 116¬∞13'27.6\\"W A sundial is a device that tells the time of day when there is sunlight by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky. In the narrowest sense of the word, it consists of a flat plate (the dial) and a gnomon, which casts a shadow onto the dial. As the Sun appears to move across the sky, the shadow aligns with different hour-lines, which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day. The style is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or nodus may be used. The gnomon casts a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, wire, or elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year. The style's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial's geographical latitude. In a broader sense, a sundial is any device that uses the Sun's altitude or azimuth (or both) to show the time. In addition to their time-telling function, sundials are valued as decorative objects, literary metaphors, and objects of intrigue and mathematical study. A rudimentary sundial can be easily constructed to mark the passing of time by placing a stick in the sand or a nail in a board and placing markers at the edge of a shadow or outlining a shadow at intervals. It is common for inexpensive, mass-produced decorative sundials to have incorrectly aligned gnomons, shadow lengths, and hour-lines, which cannot be adjusted to tell correct time.  Introduction  There are several different types of sundials. Some sundials use a shadow or the edge of a shadow while others use a line or spot of light to indicate the time. The shadow-casting object, known as a gnomon, may be a long thin rod or other object with a sharp tip or a straight edge. Sundials employ many types of gnomon. The gnomon may be fixed or moved according to the season. It may be oriented vertically, horizontally, aligned with the Earth's axis, or oriented in an altogether different direction determined by mathematics. Given that sundials use light to indicate time, a line of light may be formed by allowing the Sun's rays through a thin slit or focusing them through a cylindrical lens. A spot of light may be formed by allowing the Sun's rays to pass through a small hole, window, oculus, or by reflecting them from a small circular mirror. A spot of light can be as small as a pinhole in a solargraph or as large as the oculus in the Pantheon. Sundials also may use many types of surfaces to receive the light or shadow. Planes are the most common surface, but partial spheres, cylinders, cones and other shapes have been used for greater accuracy or beauty. Sundials differ in their portability and their need for orientation. The installation of many dials requires knowing the local latitude, the precise vertical direction (e.g., by a level or plumb- bob), and the direction to true North. Portable dials are self-aligning: for example, it may have two dials that operate on different principles, such as a horizontal and analemmatic dial, mounted together on one plate. In these designs, their times agree only when the plate is aligned properly. Sundials may indicate the local solar time only. To obtain the national clock time, three corrections are required: # The orbit of the Earth is not perfectly circular and its rotational axis is not perpendicular to its orbit. The sundial's indicated solar time thus varies from clock time by small amounts that change throughout the year. This correctionwhich may be as great as 16 minutes, 33 secondsis described by the equation of time. A sophisticated sundial, with a curved style or hour lines, may incorporate this correction. The more usual simpler sundials sometimes have a small plaque that gives the offsets at various times of the year. # The solar time must be corrected for the longitude of the sundial relative to the longitude of the official time zone. For example, an uncorrected sundial located west of Greenwich, England but within the same time-zone, shows an earlier time than the official time. It may show \\"11:45\\" at official noon, and will show \\"noon\\" after the official noon. This correction can easily be made by rotating the hour-lines by a constant angle equal to the difference in longitudes, which makes this is a commonly possible design option. # To adjust for daylight saving time, if applicable, the solar time must additionally be shifted for the official difference (usually one hour). This is also a correction that can be done on the dial, i.e. by numbering the hour-lines with two sets of numbers, or even by swapping the numbering in some designs. More often this is simply ignored, or mentioned on the plaque with the other corrections, if there is one. Apparent motion of the Sun Top view of an equatorial sundial. The hour lines are spaced equally about the circle, and the shadow of the gnomon (a thin cylindrical rod) rotates uniformly. The height of the gnomon is the outer radius of the dial. This animation depicts the motion of the shadow from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. (not accounting for Daylight Saving Time) on or around Solstice, when the Sun is at its highest declination (roughly 23.5¬∞). Sunrise and sunset occur at 3am and 9pm, respectively, on that day at geographical latitudes near 57.05¬∞, roughly the latitude of Aberdeen, Scotland or Sitka, Alaska.The principles of sundials are understood most easily from the Sun's apparent motion. The Earth rotates on its axis, and revolves in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. An excellent approximation assumes that the Sun revolves around a stationary Earth on the celestial sphere, which rotates every 24 hours about its celestial axis. The celestial axis is the line connecting the celestial poles. Since the celestial axis is aligned with the axis about which the Earth rotates, the angle of the axis with the local horizontal is the local geographical latitude. Unlike the fixed stars, the Sun changes its position on the celestial sphere, being - on north hemisphere - at a positive declination in spring and summer, and at a negative declination in autumn and winter, and having exactly zero declination (i.e., being on the celestial equator) at the equinoxes. The Sun's celestial longitude also varies, changing by one complete revolution per year. The path of the Sun on the celestial sphere is called the ecliptic. The ecliptic passes through the twelve constellations of the zodiac in the course of a year. Sundial in Singapore Botanic Gardens. The fact that Singapore is located almost at the equator is reflected in its design. This model of the Sun's motion helps to understand sundials. If the shadow-casting gnomon is aligned with the celestial poles, its shadow will revolve at a constant rate, and this rotation will not change with the seasons. This is the most common design. In such cases, the same hour lines may be used throughout the year. The hour-lines will be spaced uniformly if the surface receiving the shadow is either perpendicular (as in the equatorial sundial) or circular about the gnomon (as in the armillary sphere). In other cases, the hour-lines are not spaced evenly, even though the shadow rotates uniformly. If the gnomon is not aligned with the celestial poles, even its shadow will not rotate uniformly, and the hour lines must be corrected accordingly. The rays of light that graze the tip of a gnomon, or which pass through a small hole, or reflect from a small mirror, trace out a cone aligned with the celestial poles. The corresponding light-spot or shadow-tip, if it falls onto a flat surface, will trace out a conic section, such as a hyperbola, ellipse or (at the North or South Poles) a circle. This conic section is the intersection of the cone of light rays with the flat surface. This cone and its conic section change with the seasons, as the Sun's declination changes; hence, sundials that follow the motion of such light- spots or shadow-tips often have different hour-lines for different times of the year. This is seen in shepherd's dials, sundial rings, and vertical gnomons such as obelisks. Alternatively, sundials may change the angle or position (or both) of the gnomon relative to the hour lines, as in the analemmatic dial or the Lambert dial. History World's oldest sundial, from Egypt's Valley of the Kings (c. 1500 BC) The earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are shadow clocks (1500 BC or BCE) from ancient Egyptian astronomy and Babylonian astronomy. Presumably, humans were telling time from shadow-lengths at an even earlier date, but this is hard to verify. In roughly 700 BC, the Old Testament describes a sundial‚Äîthe \\"dial of Ahaz\\" mentioned in and . By 240 BC Eratosthenes had estimated the circumference of the world using an obelisk and a water well and a few centuries later Ptolemy had charted the latitude of cities using the angle of the sun. The people of Kush created sun dials through geometry. The Roman writer Vitruvius lists dials and shadow clocks known at that time in his De architectura. A canonical sundial is one that indicates the canonical hours of liturgical acts. Such sundials were used from the 7th to the 14th centuries by the members of religious communities. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria (c. 1620) discusses how to make a perfect sundial. They have been commonly used since the 16th century. Terminology London type horizontal dial. The western edge of the gnomon is used as the style before noon, the eastern edge after that time. The changeover causes a discontinuity, the noon gap, in the time scale. In general, sundials indicate the time by casting a shadow or throwing light onto a surface known as a dial face or dial plate. Although usually a flat plane, the dial face may also be the inner or outer surface of a sphere, cylinder, cone, helix, and various other shapes. The time is indicated where a shadow or light falls on the dial face, which is usually inscribed with hour lines. Although usually straight, these hour lines may also be curved, depending on the design of the sundial (see below). In some designs, it is possible to determine the date of the year, or it may be required to know the date to find the correct time. In such cases, there may be multiple sets of hour lines for different months, or there may be mechanisms for setting/calculating the month. In addition to the hour lines, the dial face may offer other data‚Äîsuch as the horizon, the equator and the tropics‚Äîwhich are referred to collectively as the dial furniture. The entire object that casts a shadow or light onto the dial face is known as the sundial's gnomon. However, it is usually only an edge of the gnomon (or another linear feature) that casts the shadow used to determine the time; this linear feature is known as the sundial's style. The style is usually aligned parallel to the axis of the celestial sphere, and therefore is aligned with the local geographical meridian. In some sundial designs, only a point-like feature, such as the tip of the style, is used to determine the time and date; this point-like feature is known as the sundial's nodus. Some sundials use both a style and a nodus to determine the time and date. The gnomon is usually fixed relative to the dial face, but not always; in some designs such as the analemmatic sundial, the style is moved according to the month. If the style is fixed, the line on the dial plate perpendicularly beneath the style is called the substyle, meaning \\"below the style\\". The angle the style makes with the plane of the dial plate is called the substyle height, an unusual use of the word height to mean an angle. On many wall dials, the substyle is not the same as the noon line (see below). The angle on the dial plate between the noon line and the substyle is called the substyle distance, an unusual use of the word distance to mean an angle. By tradition, many sundials have a motto. The motto is usually in the form of an epigram: sometimes sombre reflections on the passing of time and the brevity of life, but equally often humorous witticisms of the dial maker. One such quip is, I am a sundial, and I make a botch, Of what is done much better by a watch. A dial is said to be equiangular if its hour-lines are straight and spaced equally. Most equiangular sundials have a fixed gnomon style aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, as well as a shadow-receiving surface that is symmetrical about that axis; examples include the equatorial dial, the equatorial bow, the armillary sphere, the cylindrical dial and the conical dial. However, other designs are equiangular, such as the Lambert dial, a version of the analemmatic sundial with a moveable style. In the Southern Hemisphere Southern-hemisphere sundial in Perth, Australia. Magnify to see that the hour marks run anticlockwise. Note graph above the gnomon of the Equation of Time, needed to correct sundial readings. A sundial at a particular latitude in one hemisphere must be reversed for use at the opposite latitude in the other hemisphere. A vertical direct south sundial in the Northern Hemisphere becomes a vertical direct north sundial in the Southern Hemisphere. To position a horizontal sundial correctly, one has to find true North or South. The same process can be used to do both. The gnomon, set to the correct latitude, has to point to the true South in the Southern hemisphere as in the Northern Hemisphere it has to point to the true North. The hour numbers also run in opposite directions, so on a horizontal dial they run anticlockwise (US: counterclockwise) rather than clockwise. Sundials which are designed to be used with their plates horizontal in one hemisphere can be used with their plates vertical at the complementary latitude in the other hemisphere. For example, the illustrated sundial in Perth, Australia, which is at latitude 32 degrees South, would function properly if it were mounted on a south-facing vertical wall at latitude 58 (i.e. 90-32) degrees North, which is slightly further North than Perth, Scotland. The surface of the wall in Scotland would be parallel with the horizontal ground in Australia (ignoring the difference of longitude), so the sundial would work identically on both surfaces. Correspondingly, the hour marks, which run counterclockwise on a horizontal sundial in the southern hemisphere, also do so on a vertical sundial in the northern hemisphere. (See the first two illustrations at the top of this article.) On horizontal northern-hemisphere sundials, and on vertical southern-hemisphere ones, the hour marks run clockwise. Adjustments to calculate clock time from a sundial reading The most common reason for a sundial to differ greatly from clock time is that the sundial has not been oriented correctly or its hour lines have not been drawn correctly. For example, most commercial sundials are designed as horizontal sundials as described above. To be accurate, such a sundial must have been designed for the local geographical latitude and its style must be parallel to the Earth's rotational axis; the style must be aligned with true North and its height (its angle with the horizontal) must equal the local latitude. To adjust the style height, the sundial can often be tilted slightly \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" while maintaining the style's north-south alignment. =Summer (daylight saving) time correction= Some areas of the world practice daylight saving time, which changes the official time, usually by one hour. This shift must be added to the sundial's time to make it agree with the official time. =Time-zone (longitude) correction= A standard time zone covers roughly 15¬∞ of longitude, so any point within that zone which is not on the reference longitude (generally a multiple of 15¬∞) will experience a difference from standard time equal to 4 minutes of time per degree. For illustration, sunsets and sunrises are at a much later \\"official\\" time at the western edge of a time-zone, compared to sunrise and sunset times at the eastern edge. If a sundial is located at, say, a longitude 5¬∞ west of the reference longitude, its time will read 20 minutes slow, since the Sun appears to revolve around the Earth at 15¬∞ per hour. This is a constant correction throughout the year. For equiangular dials such as equatorial, spherical or Lambert dials, this correction can be made by rotating the dial surface by an angle equaling the difference in longitude, without changing the gnomon position or orientation. However, this method does not work for other dials, such as a horizontal dial; the correction must be applied by the viewer. At its most extreme, time zones can cause official noon, including daylight savings, to occur up to three hours early (the Sun is actually on the meridian at official clock time of 3 pm). This occurs in the far west of Alaska, China, and Spain. For more details and examples, see Skewing of time zones. = Equation of time correction = The Equation of Time ‚Äì above the axis the equation of time is positive, and a sundial will appear fast relative to a clock showing local mean time. The opposites are true below the axis. The Whitehurst & Son sundial made in 1812, with a circular scale showing the equation of time correction. This is now on display in the Derby Museum. Although the Sun appears to rotate uniformly about the Earth, in reality this motion is not perfectly uniform. This is due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (the fact that the Earth's orbit about the Sun is not perfectly circular, but slightly elliptical) and the tilt (obliquity) of the Earth's rotational axis relative to the plane of its orbit. Therefore, sundial time varies from standard clock time. On four days of the year, the correction is effectively zero. However, on others, it can be as much as a quarter-hour early or late. The amount of correction is described by the equation of time. This correction is equal worldwide: it does not depend on the local latitude or longitude of the observer's position. It does, however, change over long periods of time, (centuries or more, ) because of slow variations in the Earth's orbital and rotational motions. Therefore, tables and graphs of the equation of time that were made centuries ago are now significantly incorrect. The reading of an old sundial should be corrected by applying the present-day equation of time, not one from the period when the dial was made. In some sundials, the equation of time correction is provided as an informational plaque affixed to the sundial, for the observer to calculate. In more sophisticated sundials the equation can be incorporated automatically. For example, some equatorial bow sundials are supplied with a small wheel that sets the time of year; this wheel in turn rotates the equatorial bow, offsetting its time measurement. In other cases, the hour lines may be curved, or the equatorial bow may be shaped like a vase, which exploits the changing altitude of the sun over the year to effect the proper offset in time. A heliochronometer is a precision sundial first devised in about 1763 by Philipp Hahn and improved by Abb√© Guyoux in about 1827. It corrects apparent solar time to mean solar time or another standard time. Heliochronometers usually indicate the minutes to within 1 minute of Universal Time. Sunquest sundial, designed by Richard L. Schmoyer, at the Mount Cuba Observatory in Greenville, Delaware. The Sunquest sundial, designed by Richard L. Schmoyer in the 1950s, uses an analemmic inspired gnomon to cast a shaft of light onto an equatorial time-scale crescent. Sunquest is adjustable for latitude and longitude, automatically correcting for the equation of time, rendering it \\"as accurate as most pocket watches\\". Similarly, in place of the shadow of a gnomon the sundial at Miguel Hern√°ndez University uses the solar projection of a graph of the equation of time intersecting a time scale to display clock time directly. Sundial on the Orihuela Campus of Miguel Hern√°ndez University, Spain, which uses a projected graph of the equation of time within the shadow to indicate clock time. An analemma may be added to many types of sundials to correct apparent solar time to mean solar time or another standard time. These usually have hour lines shaped like \\"figure eights\\" (analemmas) according to the equation of time. This compensates for the slight eccentricity in the Earth's orbit and the tilt of the Earth's axis that causes up to a 15-minute variation from mean solar time. This is a type of dial furniture seen on more complicated horizontal and vertical dials. Prior to the invention of accurate clocks, in the mid-17th Century, sundials were the only timepieces in common use, and were considered to tell the \\"right\\" time. The Equation of Time was not used. After the invention of good clocks, sundials were still considered to be correct, and clocks usually incorrect. The Equation of Time was used in the opposite direction from today, to apply a correction to the time shown by a clock to make it agree with sundial time. Some elaborate \\"equation clocks\\", such as one made by Joseph Williamson in 1720, incorporated mechanisms to do this correction automatically. (Williamson's clock may have been the first-ever device to use a differential gear.) Only after about 1800 was uncorrected clock time considered to be \\"right\\", and sundial time usually \\"wrong\\", so the Equation of Time became used as it is today. With fixed axial gnomon The 1959 Carefree sundial in Carefree, Arizona has a gnomon, possibly the largest sundial in the United States.The Sundial and Geometry p 38. The most commonly observed sundials are those in which the shadow-casting style is fixed in position and aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, being oriented with true North and South, and making an angle with the horizontal equal to the geographical latitude. This axis is aligned with the celestial poles, which is closely, but not perfectly, aligned with the pole star Polaris. For illustration, the celestial axis points vertically at the true North Pole, where it points horizontally on the equator. At Jaipur, home of the world's largest sundial, gnomons are raised 26¬∞55\\" above horizontal, reflecting the local latitude. On any given day, the Sun appears to rotate uniformly about this axis, at about 15¬∞ per hour, making a full circuit (360¬∞) in 24 hours. A linear gnomon aligned with this axis will cast a sheet of shadow (a half-plane) that, falling opposite to the Sun, likewise rotates about the celestial axis at 15¬∞ per hour. The shadow is seen by falling on a receiving surface that is usually flat, but which may be spherical, cylindrical, conical or of other shapes. If the shadow falls on a surface that is symmetrical about the celestial axis (as in an armillary sphere, or an equatorial dial), the surface-shadow likewise moves uniformly; the hour-lines on the sundial are equally spaced. However, if the receiving surface is not symmetrical (as in most horizontal sundials), the surface shadow generally moves non-uniformly and the hour-lines are not equally spaced; one exception is the Lambert dial described below. Some types of sundials are designed with a fixed gnomon that is not aligned with the celestial poles like a vertical obelisk. Such sundials are covered below under the section, \\"Nodus-based sundials\\". =Empirical hour-line marking= The formulas shown in the paragraphs below allow the positions of the hour-lines to be calculated for various types of sundial. In some cases, the calculations are simple; in others they are extremely complicated. There is an alternative, simple method of finding the positions of the hour-lines which can be used for many types of sundial, and saves a lot of work in cases where the calculations are complex. This is an empirical procedure in which the position of the shadow of the gnomon of a real sundial is marked at hourly intervals. The equation of time must be taken into account to ensure that the positions of the hour-lines are independent of the time of year when they are marked. An easy way to do this is to set a clock or watch so it shows \\"sundial time\\" which is standard time, plus the equation of time on the day in question. The hour-lines on the sundial are marked to show the positions of the shadow of the style when this clock shows whole numbers of hours, and are labelled with these numbers of hours. For example, when the clock reads 5:00, the shadow of the style is marked, and labelled \\"5\\" (or \\"V\\" in Roman numerals). If the hour- lines are not all marked in a single day, the clock must be adjusted every day or two to take account of the variation of the equation of time. =Equatorial sundials= Timepiece, St Katharine Docks, London (1973) an equinoctial dial by Wendy Taylor An equatorial sundial in the Forbidden City, Beijing. The gnomon points true North and its angle with horizontal equals the local latitude. Closer inspection of the full-size image reveals the \\"spider-web\\" of date rings and hour-lines. The distinguishing characteristic of the equatorial dial (also called the equinoctial dial) is the planar surface that receives the shadow, which is exactly perpendicular to the gnomon's style. This plane is called equatorial, because it is parallel to the equator of the Earth and of the celestial sphere. If the gnomon is fixed and aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, the sun's apparent rotation about the Earth casts a uniformly rotating sheet of shadow from the gnomon; this produces a uniformly rotating line of shadow on the equatorial plane. Since the sun rotates 360¬∞ in 24 hours, the hour-lines on an equatorial dial are all spaced 15¬∞ apart (360/24). : H_E = 15^{\\\\circ}\\\\times t\\\\text{ (hours)}. The uniformity of their spacing makes this type of sundial easy to construct. If the dial plate material is opaque, both sides of the equatorial dial must be marked, since the shadow will be cast from below in winter and from above in summer. With translucent dial plates (e.g. glass) the hour angles need only be marked on the sun-facing side, although the hour numberings (if used) need be made on both sides of the dial, owing to the differing hour schema on the sun-facing and sun-backing sides. Another major advantage of this dial is that equation of time (EoT) and daylight saving time (DST) corrections can be made by simply rotating the dial plate by the appropriate angle each day. This is because the hour angles are equally spaced around the dial. For this reason, an equatorial dial is often a useful choice when the dial is for public display and it is desirable to have it show the true local time to reasonable accuracy. The EoT correction is made via the relation : \\\\text{Correction}^{\\\\circ} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{EoT (minutes)} + 60 \\\\times \\\\Delta \\\\text{DST (hours)}}{4}. Near the equinoxes in spring and autumn, the sun moves on a circle that is nearly the same as the equatorial plane; hence, no clear shadow is produced on the equatorial dial at those times of year, a drawback of the design. A nodus is sometimes added to equatorial sundials, which allows the sundial to tell the time of year. On any given day, the shadow of the nodus moves on a circle on the equatorial plane, and the radius of the circle measures the declination of the sun. The ends of the gnomon bar may be used as the nodus, or some feature along its length. An ancient variant of the equatorial sundial has only a nodus (no style) and the concentric circular hour-lines are arranged to resemble a spider-web. =Horizontal sundials= Horizontal sundial in Minnesota. June 17, 2007 at 12:21. 44¬∞51‚Ä≤39.3‚Ä≥N, 93¬∞36‚Ä≤58.4‚Ä≥W In the horizontal sundial (also called a garden sundial), the plane that receives the shadow is aligned horizontally, rather than being perpendicular to the style as in the equatorial dial. Hence, the line of shadow does not rotate uniformly on the dial face; rather, the hour lines are spaced according to the rule. : \\\\tan H_H = \\\\sin L \\\\tan(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t) Or in other terms: : \\\\ H_H = \\\\tan^{-1}[\\\\sin L \\\\times \\\\tan(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t)] where L is the sundial's geographical latitude (and the angle the gnomon makes with the dial plate), H_H is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points towards true North) on the plane, and t is the number of hours before or after noon. For example, the angle H_H of the 3pm hour-line would equal the arctangent of sin L, since tan 45¬∞ = 1. When L equals 90¬∞ (at the North Pole), the horizontal sundial becomes an equatorial sundial; the style points straight up (vertically), and the horizontal plane is aligned with the equatorial plane; the hour-line formula becomes H_H = 15¬∞ √ó t, as for an equatorial dial. A horizontal sundial at the Earth's equator, where L equals 0¬∞, would require a (raised) horizontal style and would be an example of a polar sundial (see below). Crude sundial near Johnson Space Center Detail of horizontal sundial outside Kew Palace in London, United Kingdom The chief advantages of the horizontal sundial are that it is easy to read, and the sunlight lights the face throughout the year. All the hour-lines intersect at the point where the gnomon's style crosses the horizontal plane. Since the style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, the style points true North and its angle with the horizontal equals the sundial's geographical latitude L. A sundial designed for one latitude can be adjusted for use at another latitude by tilting its base upwards or downwards by an angle equal to the difference in latitude. For example, a sundial designed for a latitude of 40¬∞ can be used at a latitude of 45¬∞, if the sundial plane is tilted upwards by 5¬∞, thus aligning the style with the Earth's rotational axis. Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. Some mass-produced garden sundials fail to correctly calculate the hourlines and so can never be corrected. A local standard time zone is nominally 15 degrees wide, but may be modified to follow geographic or political boundaries. A sundial can be rotated around its style (which must remain pointed at the celestial pole) to adjust to the local time zone. In most cases, a rotation in the range of 7.5 degrees east to 23 degrees west suffices. This will introduce error in sundials that do not have equal hour angles. To correct for daylight saving time, a face needs two sets of numerals or a correction table. An informal standard is to have numerals in hot colors for summer, and in cool colors for winter. Since the hour angles are not evenly spaced, the equation of time corrections cannot be made via rotating the dial plate about the gnomon axis. These types of dials usually have an equation of time correction tabulation engraved on their pedestals or close by. Horizontal dials are commonly seen in gardens, churchyards and in public areas. =Vertical sundials= Two vertical dials at Houghton Hall Norfolk UK . The left and right dials face South and East, respectively. Both styles are parallel, their angle to the horizontal equaling the latitude. The East-facing dial is a polar dial with parallel hour-lines, the dial-face being parallel to the style. In the common vertical dial, the shadow-receiving plane is aligned vertically; as usual, the gnomon's style is aligned with the Earth's axis of rotation. As in the horizontal dial, the line of shadow does not move uniformly on the face; the sundial is not equiangular. If the face of the vertical dial points directly south, the angle of the hour-lines is instead described by the formula : \\\\tan H_V = \\\\cos L \\\\tan(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t) where L is the sundial's geographical latitude, H_V is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points due north) on the plane, and t is the number of hours before or after noon. For example, the angle H_V of the 3pm hour-line would equal the arctangent of cos L, since tan 45¬∞ = 1. The shadow moves counter-clockwise on a south-facing vertical dial, whereas it runs clockwise on horizontal and equatorial north-facing dials. Dials with faces perpendicular to the ground and which face directly South, North, East, or West are called vertical direct dials. It is widely believed, and stated in respectable publications, that a vertical dial cannot receive more than twelve hours of sunlight a day, no matter how many hours of daylight there are. However, there is an exception. Vertical sundials in the tropics which face the nearer pole (e.g. north facing in the zone between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer) can actually receive sunlight for more than 12 hours from sunrise to sunset for a short period around the time of the summer solstice. For example, at latitude 20 degrees North, on June 21, the sun shines on a north-facing vertical wall for 13 hours, 21 minutes. Vertical sundials which do not face directly South (in the northern hemisphere) may receive significantly less than twelve hours of sunlight per day, depending on the direction they do face, and on the time of year. For example, a vertical dial that faces due East can tell time only in the morning hours; in the afternoon, the sun does not shine on its face. Vertical dials that face due East or West are polar dials, which will be described below. Vertical dials that face North are uncommon, because they tell time only during the spring and summer, and do not show the midday hours except in tropical latitudes (and even there, only around midsummer). For non- direct vertical dials‚Äîthose that face in non-cardinal directions‚Äîthe mathematics of arranging the style and the hour-lines becomes more complicated; it may be easier to mark the hour lines by observation, but the placement of the style, at least, must be calculated first; such dials are said to be declining dials. \\"Double\\" sundials in Nov√© Mƒõsto nad Metuj√≠, Czech Republic; the observer is facing almost due north. Vertical dials are commonly mounted on the walls of buildings, such as town-halls, cupolas and church- towers, where they are easy to see from far away. In some cases, vertical dials are placed on all four sides of a rectangular tower, providing the time throughout the day. The face may be painted on the wall, or displayed in inlaid stone; the gnomon is often a single metal bar, or a tripod of metal bars for rigidity. If the wall of the building faces toward the South, but does not face due South, the gnomon will not lie along the noon line, and the hour lines must be corrected. Since the gnomon's style must be parallel to the Earth's axis, it always \\"points\\" true North and its angle with the horizontal will equal the sundial's geographical latitude; on a direct south dial, its angle with the vertical face of the dial will equal the colatitude, or 90¬∞ minus the latitude. =Polar dials= Melbourne Planetarium In polar dials, the shadow-receiving plane is aligned parallel to the gnomon-style. Thus, the shadow slides sideways over the surface, moving perpendicularly to itself as the Sun rotates about the style. As with the gnomon, the hour-lines are all aligned with the Earth's rotational axis. When the Sun's rays are nearly parallel to the plane, the shadow moves very quickly and the hour lines are spaced far apart. The direct East- and West-facing dials are examples of a polar dial. However, the face of a polar dial need not be vertical; it need only be parallel to the gnomon. Thus, a plane inclined at the angle of latitude (relative to horizontal) under the similarly inclined gnomon will be a polar dial. The perpendicular spacing X of the hour-lines in the plane is described by the formula : X = H \\\\tan(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t) where H is the height of the style above the plane, and t is the time (in hours) before or after the center-time for the polar dial. The center time is the time when the style's shadow falls directly down on the plane; for an East-facing dial, the center time will be 6am, for a West-facing dial, this will be 6pm, and for the inclined dial described above, it will be noon. When t approaches ¬±6 hours away from the center time, the spacing X diverges to +‚àû; this occurs when the Sun's rays become parallel to the plane. =Vertical declining dials= South- Southwest, Southwest, and West-Southwest, the hour lines are asymmetrical about noon, with the morning hour-lines ever more widely spaced. Two sundials, a large and a small one, at Fatih Mosque, Istanbul dating back to the late 16th century. It is on the southwest facade with an azimuth angle of 52¬∞ N. A declining dial is any non-horizontal, planar dial that does not face in a cardinal direction, such as (true) North, South, East or West. As usual, the gnomon's style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, but the hour- lines are not symmetrical about the noon hour-line. For a vertical dial, the angle H_\\\\text{VD} between the noon hour-line and another hour-line is given by the formula below. Note that H_\\\\text{VD} is defined positive in the clockwise sense w.r.t. the upper vertical hour angle; and that its conversion to the equivalent solar hour requires careful consideration of which quadrant of the sundial that it belongs in. : \\\\tan H_\\\\text{VD} = \\\\frac{\\\\cos L}{\\\\cos D \\\\cot(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t) - s_o \\\\sin L \\\\sin D } where L is the sundial's geographical latitude; t is the time before or after noon; D is the angle of declination from true south, defined as positive when east of south; and s_o is a switch integer for the dial orientation. A partly south-facing dial has an s_o value of + 1; those partly north-facing, a value of -1. When such a dial faces South ( D = 0^{\\\\circ} ), this formula reduces to the formula given above for vertical south-facing dials, i.e. : \\\\tan H_\\\\text{V} = \\\\cos L \\\\tan(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t) When a sundial is not aligned with a cardinal direction, the substyle of its gnomon is not aligned with the noon hour-line. The angle B between the substyle and the noon hour-line is given by the formula : \\\\tan B = \\\\sin D \\\\cot L If a vertical sundial faces true South or North ( D = 0^{\\\\circ} or D = 180^{\\\\circ} , respectively), the angle B = 0^{\\\\circ} and the substyle is aligned with the noon hour-line. The height of the gnomon, that is the angle the style makes to the plate, G , is given by : : \\\\sin G = \\\\cos D \\\\cos L =Reclining dials= Vertical reclining dial in the Southern Hemisphere, facing due north, with hyperbolic declination lines and hour lines. Ordinary vertical sundial at this latitude (between tropics) could not produce a declination line for the summer solstice. This particular sundial is located at the Valongo Observatory of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The sundials described above have gnomons that are aligned with the Earth's rotational axis and cast their shadow onto a plane. If the plane is neither vertical nor horizontal nor equatorial, the sundial is said to be reclining or inclining.Rohr (1965), pp. 70‚Äì81; Waugh (1973), pp. 100‚Äì107; Mayall and Mayall (1994), pp. 59‚Äì60, 117‚Äì122, 144‚Äì145. Such a sundial might be located on a South-facing roof, for example. The hour-lines for such a sundial can be calculated by slightly correcting the horizontal formula aboveRohr (1965), p. 77; Waugh (1973), pp. 101‚Äì103; : \\\\tan H_{RV} = \\\\cos(L + R) \\\\tan(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t) where R is the desired angle of reclining relative to the local vertical, L is the sundial's geographical latitude, H_{RV} is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points due north) on the plane, and t is the number of hours before or after noon. For example, the angle H_{RV} of the 3pm hour-line would equal the arctangent of cos(L + R), since tan 45¬∞ = 1. When R equals 0¬∞ (in other words, a South-facing vertical dial), we obtain the vertical dial formula above. Some authors use a more specific nomenclature to describe the orientation of the shadow-receiving plane. If the plane's face points downwards towards the ground, it is said to be proclining or inclining, whereas a dial is said to be reclining when the dial face is pointing away from the ground. Many authors also often refer to reclined, proclined and inclined sundials in general as inclined sundials. It is also common in the latter case to measure the angle of inclination relative to the horizontal plane on the sun side of the dial. In such texts, since I = 90¬∞ + R, the hour angle formula will often be seen written as : : \\\\tan H_{RV} = \\\\sin(L + I) \\\\tan(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t) The angle between the gnomon style and the dial plate, B, in this type of sundial is : : B = 90^{\\\\circ} - (L + R) Or : : B = 180^{\\\\circ} - (L + I) =Declining-reclining dials/ Declining-inclining dials= Some sundials both decline and recline, in that their shadow- receiving plane is not oriented with a cardinal direction (such as true North or true South) and is neither horizontal nor vertical nor equatorial. For example, such a sundial might be found on a roof that was not oriented in a cardinal direction. The formulae describing the spacing of the hour-lines on such dials are rather more complicated than those for simpler dials. There are various solution approaches, including some using the methods of rotation matrices, and some making a 3D model of the reclined-declined plane and its vertical declined counterpart plane, extracting the geometrical relationships between the hour angle components on both these planes and then reducing the trigonometric algebra. One system of formulas for Reclining-Declining sundials: (as stated by Fennewick) The angle H_\\\\text{RD} between the noon hour-line and another hour-line is given by the formula below. Note that H_\\\\text{RD} advances counterclockwise with respect to the zero hour angle for those dials that are partly south-facing and clockwise for those that are north-facing. : \\\\tan H_\\\\text{RD} = \\\\frac{\\\\cos R \\\\cos L - \\\\sin R \\\\sin L \\\\cos D - s_o \\\\sin R \\\\sin D \\\\cot(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t)}{\\\\cos D \\\\cot(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t) - s_o \\\\sin D \\\\sin L } within the parameter ranges : D < D_c and -90^{\\\\circ} < R < (90^{\\\\circ} - L) . Or, if preferring to use inclination angle, I , rather than the reclination, R , where I = (90^{\\\\circ} + R) : : \\\\tan H_\\\\text{RD} = \\\\frac{\\\\sin I \\\\cos L + \\\\cos I \\\\sin L \\\\cos D + s_o \\\\cos I \\\\sin D \\\\cot(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t)}{\\\\cos D \\\\cot(15^{\\\\circ} \\\\times t) - s_o \\\\sin D \\\\sin L } within the parameter ranges : D < D_c and 0^{\\\\circ} < I < (180^{\\\\circ} - L) . Here L is the sundial's geographical latitude; s_o is the orientation switch integer; t is the time in hours before or after noon; and R and D are the angles of reclination and declination, respectively. Note that R is measured with reference to the vertical. It is positive when the dial leans back towards the horizon behind the dial and negative when the dial leans forward to the horizon on the Sun's side. Declination angle D is defined as positive when moving east of true south. Dials facing fully or partly south have s_o = +1, while those partly or fully north-facing have an s_o value of -1. Since the above expression gives the hour angle as an arctan function, due consideration must be given to which quadrant of the sundial each hour belongs to before assigning the correct hour angle. Unlike the simpler vertical declining sundial, this type of dial does not always show hour angles on its sunside face for all declinations between east and west. When a northern hemisphere partly south-facing dial reclines back (i.e. away from the Sun) from the vertical, the gnomon will become co-planar with the dial plate at declinations less than due east or due west. Likewise for southern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing. Were these dials reclining forward, the range of declination would actually exceed due east and due west. In a similar way, northern hemisphere dials that are partly north- facing and southern hemisphere dials that are south-facing, and which lean forward toward their upward pointing gnomons, will have a similar restriction on the range of declination that is possible for a given reclination value. The critical declination D_c is a geometrical constraint which depends on the value of both the dial's reclination and its latitude : : \\\\cos D_c = \\\\tan R \\\\tan L = - \\\\tan L \\\\cot I As with the vertical declined dial, the gnomon's substyle is not aligned with the noon hour-line. The general formula for the angle B , between the substyle and the noon-line is given by : : \\\\tan B = \\\\frac {\\\\sin D}{\\\\sin R \\\\cos D + \\\\cos R \\\\tan L} = \\\\frac {\\\\sin D}{\\\\cos I \\\\cos D - \\\\sin I \\\\tan L} The angle G , between the style and the plate is given by : : \\\\sin G = \\\\cos L \\\\cos D \\\\cos R - \\\\sin L \\\\sin R = - \\\\cos L \\\\cos D \\\\sin I + \\\\sin L \\\\cos I Note that for G = 0^{\\\\circ}, i.e. when the gnomon is coplanar with the dial plate, we have : : \\\\cos D = \\\\tan L \\\\tan R = - \\\\tan L \\\\cot I i.e. when D = D_c , the critical declination value. Empirical method Because of the complexity of the above calculations, using them for the practical purpose of designing a dial of this type is difficult and prone to error. It has been suggested that it is better to locate the hour lines empirically, marking the positions of the shadow of a style on a real sundial at hourly intervals as shown by a clock and adding/deducting that day's equation of time adjustment. See Empirical hour-line marking, above. =Spherical sundials= Equatorial bow sundial in Hasselt, Flanders in Belgium . The rays pass through the narrow slot, forming a uniformly rotating sheet of light that falls on the circular bow. The hour-lines are equally spaced; in this image, the local solar time is roughly 15:00 hours (3 p.m.). On September 10, a small ball, welded into the slot casts a shadow on centre of the hour band. The surface receiving the shadow need not be a plane, but can have any shape, provided that the sundial maker is willing to mark the hour-lines. If the style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, a spherical shape is convenient since the hour-lines are equally spaced, as they are on the equatorial dial above; the sundial is equiangular. This is the principle behind the armillary sphere and the equatorial bow sundial. However, some equiangular sundials‚Äîsuch as the Lambert dial described below‚Äîare based on other principles. In the equatorial bow sundial, the gnomon is a bar, slot or stretched wire parallel to the celestial axis. The face is a semicircle, corresponding to the equator of the sphere, with markings on the inner surface. This pattern, built a couple of meters wide out of temperature- invariant steel invar, was used to keep the trains running on time in France before World War I. Among the most precise sundials ever made are two equatorial bows constructed of marble found in Yantra mandir. This collection of sundials and other astronomical instruments was built by Maharaja Jai Singh II at his then-new capital of Jaipur, India between 1727 and 1733. The larger equatorial bow is called the Samrat Yantra (The Supreme Instrument); standing at 27 meters, its shadow moves visibly at 1 mm per second, or roughly a hand's breadth (6 cm) every minute. =Cylindrical, conical, and other non-planar sundials= leftuprightthumb170pxPrecision sundial in B√ºtgenbach, Belgium. (Precision=¬±30seconds) [http://toolserver.org/~para/GeoCommons/earth.php?latdegdec=50.4231&londegdec;=6.2017&scale;=10000&&commons;=1/ (Google Earth)] Other non-planar surfaces may be used to receive the shadow of the gnomon. As an elegant alternative, the style (which could be created by a hole or slit in the circumference) may be located on the circumference of a cylinder or sphere, rather than at its central axis of symmetry. In that case, the hour lines are again spaced equally, but at twice the usual angle, due to the geometrical inscribed angle theorem. This is the basis of some modern sundials, but it was also used in ancient times; In another variation of the polar-axis-aligned cylindrical, a cylindrical dial could be rendered as a helical ribbon-like surface, with a thin gnomon located either along its center or at its periphery. Movable-gnomon sundials Sundials can be designed with a gnomon that is placed in a different position each day throughout the year. In other words, the position of the gnomon relative to the centre of the hour lines varies. The gnomon need not be aligned with the celestial poles and may even be perfectly vertical (the analemmatic dial). These dials, when combined with fixed-gnomon sundials, allow the user to determine true North with no other aid; the two sundials are correctly aligned if and only if they both show the same time. =Universal equinoctial ring dial= Commons annotations for labels. A universal equinoctial ring dial (sometimes called a ring dial for brevity, although the term is ambiguous), is a portable version of an armillary sundial, or was inspired by the mariner's astrolabe.Swanick, Lois Ann. An Analysis Of Navigational Instruments In The Age Of Exploration: 15th Century To Mid-17th Century, MA Thesis, Texas A&M; University, December 2005 It was likely invented by William Oughtred around 1600 and became common throughout Europe. In its simplest form, the style is a thin slit that allows the Sun's rays to fall on the hour-lines of an equatorial ring. As usual, the style is aligned with the Earth's axis; to do this, the user may orient the dial towards true North and suspend the ring dial vertically from the appropriate point on the meridian ring. Such dials may be made self-aligning with the addition of a more complicated central bar, instead of a simple slit-style. These bars are sometimes an addition to a set of Gemma's rings. This bar could pivot about its end points and held a perforated slider that was positioned to the month and day according to a scale scribed on the bar. The time was determined by rotating the bar towards the Sun so that the light shining through the hole fell on the equatorial ring. This forced the user to rotate the instrument, which had the effect of aligning the instrument's vertical ring with the meridian. When not in use, the equatorial and meridian rings can be folded together into a small disk. In 1610, Edward Wright created the sea ring, which mounted a universal ring dial over a magnetic compass. This permitted mariners to determine the time and magnetic variation in a single step.May, William Edward, A History of Marine Navigation, G. T. Foulis & Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, =Analemmatic sundials= meridian line in the garden of the abbey of Herkenrode in Hasselt (Flanders in Belgium) Analemmatic sundials are a type of horizontal sundial that has a vertical gnomon and hour markers positioned in an elliptical pattern. There are no hour lines on the dial and the time of day is read on the ellipse. The gnomon is not fixed and must change position daily to accurately indicate time of day. Analemmatic sundials are sometimes designed with a human as the gnomon. Human gnomon analemmatic sundials are not practical at lower latitudes where a human shadow is quite short during the summer months. A 66 inch tall person casts a 4-inch shadow at 27 deg latitude on the summer solstice.Analemmatic sundials: How to build one and why they work by C.J. Budd and C.J. Sangwin =Foster-Lambert dials= The Foster- Lambert dial is another movable-gnomon sundial. In contrast to the elliptical analemmatic dial, the Lambert dial is circular with evenly spaced hour lines, making it an equiangular sundial, similar to the equatorial, spherical, cylindrical and conical dials described above. The gnomon of a Foster-Lambert dial is neither vertical nor aligned with the Earth's rotational axis; rather, it is tilted northwards by an angle Œ± = 45¬∞ - (Œ¶/2), where Œ¶ is the geographical latitude. Thus, a Foster-Lambert dial located at latitude 40¬∞ would have a gnomon tilted away from vertical by 25¬∞ in a northerly direction. To read the correct time, the gnomon must also be moved northwards by a distance : Y = R \\\\tan \\\\alpha \\\\tan \\\\delta \\\\, where R is the radius of the Foster-Lambert dial and Œ¥ again indicates the Sun's declination for that time of year. Altitude-based sundials Altitude dials measure the height of the Sun in the sky, rather than directly measuring its hour-angle about the Earth's axis. They are not oriented towards true North, but rather towards the Sun and generally held vertically. The Sun's elevation is indicated by the position of a nodus, either the shadow-tip of a gnomon, or a spot of light. In altitude dials, the time is read from where the nodus falls on a set of hour- curves that vary with the time of year. Many such altitude-dials' construction is calculation-intensive, as also the case with many azimuth dials. But the capuchin dials (described below) are constructed and used graphically. Altitude dials' disadvantages: Since the Sun's altitude is the same at times equally spaced about noon (e.g., 9am and 3pm), the user had to know whether it was morning or afternoon. At, say, 3:00 pm, that isn't a problem. But when the dial indicates a time 15 minutes from noon, the user likely won't have a way of distinguishing 11:45 from 12:15. Additionally, altitude dials are less accurate near noon, because the sun's altitude isn't changing rapidly then. Many of these dials are portable and simple to use. As is often the case with other sundials, many altitude dials are designed for only one latitude. But the capuchin dial (described below) has a version that's adjustable for latitude. The book on sundials by Mayall & Mayall describes the Universal Capuchin sundial. =Human shadows= The length of a human shadow (or of any vertical object) can be used to measure the sun's elevation and, thence, the time.Rohr (1965), p. 15; Waugh (1973), pp. 1‚Äì3. The Venerable Bede gave a table for estimating the time from the length of one's shadow in feet, on the assumption that a monk's height is six times the length of his foot. Such shadow lengths will vary with the geographical latitude and with the time of year. For example, the shadow length at noon is short in summer months, and long in winter months. Chaucer evokes this method a few times in his Canterbury Tales, as in his Parson's Tale. An equivalent type of sundial using a vertical rod of fixed length is known as a backstaff dial. =Shepherd's dial ‚Äì timesticks= 19th-century Tibetan Shepherd's Timestick A shepherd's dial ‚Äì also known as a shepherd's column dial, pillar dial, cylinder dial or chilindre ‚Äì is a portable cylindrical sundial with a knife-like gnomon that juts out perpendicularly.Rohr (1965), pp. 109‚Äì111; Waugh (1973), pp. 150‚Äì154; Mayall and Mayall, pp. 162‚Äì166. It is normally dangled from a rope or string so the cylinder is vertical. The gnomon can be twisted to be above a month or day indication on the face of the cylinder. This corrects the sundial for the equation of time. The entire sundial is then twisted on its string so that the gnomon aims toward the Sun, while the cylinder remains vertical. The tip of the shadow indicates the time on the cylinder. The hour curves inscribed on the cylinder permit one to read the time. Shepherd's dials are sometimes hollow, so that the gnomon can fold within when not in use. The shepherd's dial is evoked in Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3 (Act 2, Scene 5, Lines 21-29), among other works of literature. The cylindrical shepherd's dial can be unrolled into a flat plate. In one simple version,Waugh (1973), pp. 166‚Äì167. the front and back of the plate each have three columns, corresponding to pairs of months with roughly the same solar declination (June‚ÄìJuly, May‚ÄìAugust, April‚ÄìSeptember, March‚ÄìOctober, February‚ÄìNovember, and January‚ÄìDecember). The top of each column has a hole for inserting the shadow- casting gnomon, a peg. Often only two times are marked on the column below, one for noon and the other for mid-morning/mid-afternoon. Timesticks, clock spear, or shepherds' time stick, are based on the same principles as dials. The time stick is carved with eight vertical time scales for a different period of the year, each bearing a time scale calculated according to the relative amount of daylight during the different months of the year. Any reading depends not only on the time of day but also on the latitude and time of year. A peg gnomon is inserted at the top in the appropriate hole or face for the season of the year, and turned to the Sun so that the shadow falls directly down the scale. Its end displays the time. =Ring dials= In a ring dial (also known as an Aquitaine or a perforated ring dial), the ring is hung vertically and oriented sideways towards the sun.Rohr (1965), p. 111; Waugh (1973), pp. 158‚Äì160; Mayall and Mayall (1994), pp. 159‚Äì162. A beam of light passes through a small hole in the ring and falls on hour-curves that are inscribed on the inside of the ring. To adjust for the equation of time, the hole is usually on a loose ring within the ring so that the hole can be adjusted to reflect the current month. =Card dials (Capuchin dials)= Card dials are another form of altitude dial.Rohr (1965), p. 110; Waugh (1973), pp. 161‚Äì165; Mayall and Mayall (1994), p. 166‚Äì185. A card is aligned edge-on with the sun and tilted so that a ray of light passes through an aperture onto a specified spot, thus determining the sun's altitude. A weighted string hangs vertically downwards from a hole in the card, and carries a bead or knot. The position of the bead on the hour-lines of the card gives the time. In more sophisticated versions such as the Capuchin dial, there is only one set of hour-lines, i.e., the hour lines do not vary with the seasons. Instead, the position of the hole from which the weighted string hangs is varied according to the season. The Capuchin sundials are constructed and used graphically, as opposed the direct hour-angle measurements of horizontal or equatorial dials; or the calculated hour angle lines of some altitude and azimuth dials. In addition to the ordinary Capuchin dial, there is a universal Capuchin dial, adjustable for latitude. =Navicula= Navicula de Venetiis on display at Mus√©e d'histoire des sciences de la Ville de Gen√®ve. A navicula de Venetiis or \\"little ship of Venice\\" was an altitude dial used to tell time and which was shaped like a little ship. The cursor (with a plumb line attached) was slid up/down the mast to the correct latitude. The user then sighted the Sun through the pair of sighting holes at either end of the \\"ship's deck\\". The plumb line then marked what hour of the day it was. Nodus-based sundials Krak√≥w. The shadow of the cross-shaped nodus moves along a hyperbola which shows the time of the year, indicated here by the zodiac figures. It is 1:50 p.m. on 16 July, 25 days after the summer solstice. Another type of sundial follows the motion of a single point of light or shadow, which may be called the nodus. For example, the sundial may follow the sharp tip of a gnomon's shadow, e.g., the shadow-tip of a vertical obelisk (e.g., the Solarium Augusti) or the tip of the horizontal marker in a shepherd's dial. Alternatively, sunlight may be allowed to pass through a small hole or reflected from a small (e.g., coin-sized) circular mirror, forming a small spot of light whose position may be followed. In such cases, the rays of light trace out a cone over the course of a day; when the rays fall on a surface, the path followed is the intersection of the cone with that surface. Most commonly, the receiving surface is a geometrical plane, so that the path of the shadow-tip or light-spot (called declination line) traces out a conic section such as a hyperbola or an ellipse. The collection of hyperbolae was called a pelekonon (axe) by the Greeks, because it resembles a double-bladed ax, narrow in the center (near the noonline) and flaring out at the ends (early morning and late evening hours). Declination lines at solstices and equinox for sundials, located at different latitudes There is a simple verification of hyperbolic declination lines on a sundial: the distance from the origin to the equinox line should be equal to harmonic mean of distances from the origin to summer and winter solstice lines. Nodus-based sundials may use a small hole or mirror to isolate a single ray of light; the former are sometimes called aperture dials. The oldest example is perhaps the antiborean sundial (antiboreum), a spherical nodus-based sundial that faces true North; a ray of sunlight enters from the South through a small hole located at the sphere's pole and falls on the hour and date lines inscribed within the sphere, which resemble lines of longitude and latitude, respectively, on a globe. =Reflection sundials= Isaac Newton developed a convenient and inexpensive sundial, in which a small mirror is placed on the sill of a south- facing window.Waugh (1973), pp. 116‚Äì121. The mirror acts like a nodus, casting a single spot of light on the ceiling. Depending on the geographical latitude and time of year, the light-spot follows a conic section, such as the hyperbolae of the pelikonon. If the mirror is parallel to the Earth's equator, and the ceiling is horizontal, then the resulting angles are those of a conventional horizontal sundial. Using the ceiling as a sundial surface exploits unused space, and the dial may be large enough to be very accurate. Multiple dials Sundials are sometimes combined into multiple dials. If two or more dials that operate on different principles ‚Äî such as an analemmatic dial and a horizontal or vertical dial ‚Äî are combined, the resulting multiple dial becomes self-aligning, most of the time. Both dials need to output both time and declination. In other words, the direction of true North need not be determined; the dials are oriented correctly when they read the same time and declination. However, the most common forms combine dials are based on the same principle and the analemmatic does not normally output the declination of the sun, thus are not self-aligning. =Diptych (tablet) sundial= Diptych sundial in the form of a lute, c. 1612. The gnomons-style is a string stretched between a horizontal and vertical face. This sundial also has a small nodus (a bead on the string) that tells time on the hyperbolic pelikinon, just above the date on the vertical face. The diptych consisted of two small flat faces, joined by a hinge.Rohr (1965), p. 112; Waugh (1973), pp. 154‚Äì155; Mayall and Mayall, pp. 23‚Äì24. Diptychs usually folded into little flat boxes suitable for a pocket. The gnomon was a string between the two faces. When the string was tight, the two faces formed both a vertical and horizontal sundial. These were made of white ivory, inlaid with black lacquer markings. The gnomons were black braided silk, linen or hemp string. With a knot or bead on the string as a nodus, and the correct markings, a diptych (really any sundial large enough) can keep a calendar well-enough to plant crops. A common error describes the diptych dial as self-aligning. This is not correct for diptych dials consisting of a horizontal and vertical dial using a string gnomon between faces, no matter the orientation of the dial faces. Since the string gnomon is continuous, the shadows must meet at the hinge; hence, any orientation of the dial will show the same time on both dials.Waugh (1973), p. 155. =Multiface dials= A common type of multiple dial has sundials on every face of a Platonic solid (regular polyhedron), usually a cube.Rohr (1965),, p. 118; Waugh (1973), pp. 155‚Äì156; Mayall and Mayall, p. 59. Extremely ornate sundials can be composed in this way, by applying a sundial to every surface of a solid object. In some cases, the sundials are formed as hollows in a solid object, e.g., a cylindrical hollow aligned with the Earth's rotational axis (in which the edges play the role of styles) or a spherical hollow in the ancient tradition of the hemisphaerium or the antiboreum. (See the History section above.) In some cases, these multiface dials are small enough to sit on a desk, whereas in others, they are large stone monuments. A Polyhedral's dial faces can be designed to give the time for different time-zones simultaneously. Examples include the Scottish sundial of the 17th and 18th century, which was often an extremely complex shape of polyhedral, and even convex, faces. =Prismatic dials= Prismatic dials are a special case of polar dials, in which the sharp edges of a prism of a concave polygon serve as the styles and the sides of the prism receive the shadow. Examples include a three-dimensional cross or star of David on gravestones. Unusual sundials =Benoy dial= Benoy Sun Clock showing 6:00 p.m. The Benoy dial was invented by Walter Gordon Benoy of Collingham, Nottinghamshire, England. Whereas a gnomon casts a sheet of shadow, his invention creates an equivalent sheet of light by allowing the Sun's rays through a thin slit, reflecting them from a long, slim mirror (usually half- cylindrical), or focusing them through a cylindrical lens. Examples of Benoy dials can be found in the United Kingdom at:List correct as of British Sundial Register 2000. *Carnfunnock Country Park, Antrim Northern Ireland *Upton Hall, British Horological Institute, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire *Within the collections of St Edmundsbury Heritage Service, Bury St Edmunds *Longleat, Wiltshire * Jodrell Bank Science Centre * Birmingham Botanical Gardens * Science Museum, London (inventory number 1975-318) =Bifilar sundial= Stainless steel bifilar sundial in Italy Invented by the German mathematician Hugo Michnik in 1922, the bifilar sundial has two non-intersecting threads parallel to the dial. Usually the second thread is orthogonal to the first. The intersection of the two threads' shadows gives the local solar time. =Digital sundial= A digital sundial indicates the current time with numerals formed by the sunlight striking it. Sundials of this type are installed in the Deutsches Museum in Munich and in the Sundial Park in Genk (Belgium), and a small version is available commercially. There is a patent for this type of sundial.Digital sundial =Globe dial= The globe dial is a sphere aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, and equipped with a spherical vane. Similar to sundials with a fixed axial style, a globe dial determines the time from the Sun's azimuthal angle in its apparent rotation about the earth. This angle can be determined by rotating the vane to give the smallest shadow. =Noon marks= Noon mark from the Greenwich Royal Observatory. The analemma is the narrow figure-8 shape, which plots the equation of time (in degrees, not time, 1¬∞=4 minutes) versus the altitude of the Sun at noon at the sundial's location. The altitude is measured vertically, the equation of time horizontally. The simplest sundials do not give the hours, but rather note the exact moment of 12:00 noon. In centuries past, such dials were used to correct mechanical clocks, which were sometimes so inaccurate as to lose or gain significant time in a single day. In some U.S. colonial-era houses, a noon- mark can often be found carved into a floor or windowsill. Such marks indicate local noon, and provide a simple and accurate time reference for households that do not possess accurate clocks. In modern times, in some Asian countries, post offices set their clocks from a precision noon-mark. These in turn provide the times for the rest of the society. The typical noon-mark sundial was a lens set above an analemmatic plate. The plate has an engraved figure- eight shape, which corresponds to plotting the equation of time (described above) versus the solar declination. When the edge of the Sun's image touches the part of the shape for the current month, this indicates that it is 12:00 noon. =Sundial cannon= A sundial cannon, sometimes called a 'meridian cannon', is a specialized sundial that is designed to create an 'audible noonmark', by automatically igniting a quantity of gunpowder at noon. These were novelties rather than precision sundials, sometimes installed in parks in Europe mainly in the late 18th or early 19th century. They typically consist of a horizontal sundial, which has in addition to a gnomon a suitably mounted lens, set to focus the rays of the sun at exactly noon on the firing pan of a miniature cannon loaded with gunpowder (but no ball). To function properly the position and angle of the lens must be adjusted seasonally. Meridian lines A horizontal line aligned on a meridian with a gnomon facing the noon-sun is termed a meridian line and does not indicate the time, but instead the day of the year. Historically they were used to accurately determine the length of the solar year. Examples are the Bianchini meridian line in Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome, and the Cassini line in San Petronio Basilica at Bologna. Sundial mottoes The association of sundials with time has inspired their designers over the centuries to display mottoes as part of the design. Often these cast the device in the role of memento mori, inviting the observer to reflect on the transience of the world and the inevitability of death. \\"Do not kill time, for it will surely kill thee.\\" Other mottoes are more whimsical: \\"I count only the sunny hours,\\" and \\"I am a sundial and I make a botch / of what is done far better by a watch.\\" Collections of sundial mottoes have often been published through the centuries. Use as a compass If a horizontal-plate sundial is made for the latitude in which it is being used, and if it is mounted with its plate horizontal and its gnomon pointing to the celestial pole that is above the horizon, then it shows the correct time in apparent solar time. Conversely, if the directions of the cardinal points are initially unknown, but the sundial is aligned so it shows the correct apparent solar time as calculated from the reading of a clock, its gnomon shows the direction of True North or South, allowing the sundial to be used as a compass. The sundial can be placed on a horizontal surface, and rotated about a vertical axis until it shows the correct time. The gnomon will then be pointing to the North, in the northern hemisphere, or to the South in the southern hemisphere. This method is much more accurate than using a watch as a compass (see Cardinal direction#Watch face) and can be used in places where the magnetic declination is large, making a magnetic compass unreliable. An alternative method uses two sundials of different designs. (See #Multiple dials, above.) The dials are attached to and aligned with each other, and are oriented so they show the same time.

He is perhaps best known today among mathematicians for Mersenne prime numbers, those which can be written in the form for some integer . He also developed Mersenne's laws, which describe the harmonics of a vibrating string (such as may be found on guitars and pianos), and his seminal work on music theory, Harmonie universelle, for which he is referred to as the \\"father of acoustics\\".Simmons, George F. (1992/2007). Calculus Gems: Brief Lives and Memorable Mathematics, p. 94. MAA. . Mersenne, an ordained Catholic priest, had many contacts in the scientific world and has been called \\"the center of the world of science and mathematics during the first half of the 1600s\\" and, because of his ability to make connections between people and ideas, \\"the post-box of Europe\\". He was also a member of the Minim religious order and wrote and lectured on theology and philosophy. Life Mersenne was born of Jeanne Mouli√®re, wife of Julien Mersenne, peasants who lived near Oiz√©, County of Maine (present-day Sarthe, France). He was educated at Le Mans and at the Jesuit College of La Fl√®che. On 17 July 1611, he joined the Minim Friars and, after studying theology and Hebrew in Paris, was ordained a priest in 1613. Between 1614 and 1618, he taught theology and philosophy at Nevers, but he returned to Paris and settled at the convent of L'Annonciade in 1620. There he studied mathematics and music and met with other kindred spirits such as Ren√© Descartes, √âtienne Pascal, Pierre Petit, Gilles de Roberval, Thomas Hobbes, and Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc. He corresponded with Giovanni Doni, Jacques Alexandre Le Tenneur, Constantijn Huygens, Galileo Galilei, and other scholars in Italy, England and the Dutch Republic. He was a staunch defender of Galileo, assisting him in translations of some of his mechanical works. For four years, Mersenne devoted himself entirely to philosophic and theological writing, and published Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim (Celebrated Questions on the Book of Genesis) (1623); L'Impiet√© des d√©istes (The Impiety of the Deists) (1624); La V√©rit√© des sciences (Truth of the Sciences Against the Sceptics, 1624). It is sometimes incorrectly stated that he was a Jesuit. He was educated by Jesuits, but he never joined the Society of Jesus. He taught theology and philosophy at Nevers and Paris. In 1635 he set up the informal Acad√©mie Parisienne (Academia Parisiensis), which had nearly 140 correspondents, including astronomers and philosophers as well as mathematicians, and was the precursor of the Acad√©mie des sciences established by Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1666. He was not afraid to cause disputes among his learned friends in order to compare their views, notable among which were disputes between Descartes and Pierre de Fermat and Jean de Beaugrand. Peter L. Bernstein, in his book Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk, wrote, \\"The Acad√©mie des Sciences in Paris and the Royal Society in London, which were founded about twenty years after Mersenne's death, were direct descendants of Mersenne's activities.\\"Bernstein 1996, p. 59. In 1635 Mersenne met with Tommaso Campanella but concluded that he could \\"teach nothing in the sciences ... but still he has a good memory and a fertile imagination.\\" Mersenne asked if Descartes wanted Campanella to come to Holland to meet him, but Descartes declined. He visited Italy fifteen times, in 1640, 1641 and 1645. In 1643‚Äì1644 Mersenne also corresponded with the German Socinian Marcin Ruar concerning the Copernican ideas of Pierre Gassendi, finding Ruar already a supporter of Gassendi's position.Murr, Sylvia, ed. (1997). Gassendi et l'Europe (in French). Paris: Vrin. . Among his correspondents were Descartes, Galileo, Roberval, Pascal, Beeckman and other scientists. He died September 1 through complications arising from a lung abscess. Works =Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim (1623)= Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim was written as a commentary on the Book of Genesis and comprises uneven sections headed by verses from the first three chapters of that book. At first sight the book appears to be a collection of treatises on various miscellaneous topics. However Robert Lenoble has shown that the principle of unity in the work is a polemic against magical and divinatory arts, cabalism, and animistic and pantheistic philosophies. He mentions Martin Del Rio's Investigations into Magic and criticises Marsilio Ficino for claiming power for images and characters. He condemns astral magic and astrology and the anima mundi, a concept popular amongst Renaissance neo-platonists. Whilst allowing for a mystical interpretation of the Cabala, he wholeheartedly condemned its magical application, particularly angelology. He also criticises Pico della Mirandola, Cornelius Agrippa, Francesco Giorgio and Robert Fludd, his main target. Fludd responded with Sophia cum moria certamen (1626), wherein he admits his involvement with the Rosicrucians. The anonymous Summum bonum (1629), another critique of Mersenne, is an openly Rosicrucian text. The cabalist Jacques Gaffarel joined Fludd's side, while Pierre Gassendi defended Mersenne. =L'Harmonie universelle (1636)= L'Harmonie universelle is perhaps Mersenne's most influential work. It is one of the earliest comprehensive works on music theory, touching on a wide range of musical concepts, and especially the mathematical relationships involved in music. The work contains the earliest formulation of what has become known as Mersenne's laws, which describe the frequency of oscillation of a stretched string. This frequency is: # Inversely proportional to the length of the string (this was known to the ancients; it is usually credited to Pythagoras) # Proportional to the square root of the stretching force, and # Inversely proportional to the square root of the mass per unit length. The formula for the lowest frequency is : f=\\\\frac{1}{2L}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{F}{\\\\mu}}, where f is the frequency [Hz], L is the length [m], F is the force [N] and Œº is the mass per unit length [kg/m]. In this book, Mersenne also introduced several innovative concepts that can be considered the basis of modern reflecting telescopes: * Much earlier than Laurent Cassegrain, he found the fundamental arrangement of the two-mirror telescope combination, a concave primary mirror associated with a convex secondary mirror, and discovered the telephoto effect that is critical in reflecting telescopes, although he was far from having understood all the implications of that discovery. * Mersenne invented the afocal telescope and the beam compressor that is useful in many multiple-mirror telescope designs.. * He recognized also that he could correct the spherical aberration of the telescope by using aspherical mirrors and that in the particular case of the afocal arrangement he could do this correction by using two parabolic mirrors, though a hyperboloid is required. Because of criticism that he encountered, especially from Descartes, Mersenne made no attempt to build a telescope of his own. =Other= Mersenne is also remembered today thanks to his association with the Mersenne primes. The Mersenne Twister, named for Mersenne primes, is frequently used in computer engineering and in related fields such as cryptography. However, Mersenne was not primarily a mathematician; he wrote about music theory and other subjects. He edited works of Euclid, Apollonius, Archimedes, and other Greek mathematicians. But perhaps his most important contribution to the advance of learning was his extensive correspondence (in Latin) with mathematicians and other scientists in many countries. At a time when the scientific journal had not yet come into being, Mersenne was the centre of a network for exchange of information. It has been argued that Mersenne used his lack of mathematical specialty, his ties to the print world, his legal acumen, and his friendship with the French mathematician and philosopher Ren√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1650) to manifest his international network of mathematicians. Mersenne's philosophical works are characterized by wide scholarship and the narrowest theological orthodoxy. His greatest service to philosophy was his enthusiastic defence of Descartes, whose agent he was in Paris and whom he visited in exile in the Netherlands. He submitted to various eminent Parisian thinkers a manuscript copy of the Meditations on First Philosophy, and defended its orthodoxy against numerous clerical critics. In later life, he gave up speculative thought and turned to scientific research, especially in mathematics, physics and astronomy. In this connection, his best known work is Trait√© de l'harmonie universelle (also referred to as Harmonie universelle) of 1636, dealing with the theory of music and musical instruments. It is regarded as a source of information on 17th-century music, especially French music and musicians, to rival even the works of Pietro Cerone. One of his many contributions to musical tuning theory was the suggestion of : \\\\sqrt[4]{\\\\frac{2}{3-\\\\sqrt{2}}} as the ratio for an equally- tempered semitone (\\\\sqrt[12]{2}). It was more accurate (0.44 cents sharp) than Vincenzo Galilei's 18/17 (1.05 cents flat), and could be constructed using straightedge and compass. Mersenne's description in the 1636 Harmonie universelle of the first absolute determination of the frequency of an audible tone (at 84 Hz) implies that he had already demonstrated that the absolute- frequency ratio of two vibrating strings, radiating a musical tone and its octave, is 1 : 2\\\\. The perceived harmony (consonance) of two such notes would be explained if the ratio of the air oscillation frequencies is also 1 : 2, which in turn is consistent with the source-air-motion-frequency-equivalence hypothesis. He also performed extensive experiments to determine the acceleration of falling objects by comparing them with the swing of pendulums, reported in his Cogitata Physico-Mathematica in 1644. He was the first to measure the length of the seconds pendulum, that is a pendulum whose swing takes one second, and the first to observe that a pendulum's swings are not isochronous as Galileo thought, but that large swings take longer than small swings. Battles with occult and mystical thinkers Two German books which circulated around Europe in 1614-15, Fama fraternitatis and Confessio Fraternitatis, claimed to be manifestos of a highly select, secret society of alchemists and sages called the Brotherhood of Rosicrucians. The books were hoaxes, but were obviously written by a small group who were reasonably knowledgeable about the sciences of the day, and their main theme was to promote educational reform (they were anti-Aristotelian). However, these books also promoted an occult view of science containing elements of Paracelsian philosophy, neo-Platonism, Cabalism and Hermeticism. In effect, they sought to establish a new form of scientific religion with some pre-Christian elements. Mersenne led the fight against acceptance of these ideas, particularly those of Rosicrucian promoter Robert Fludd, who had a lifelong battle of words with Johannes Kepler. The Rosicrucian ideas were defended by many prominent men of learning, and some members of the European scholarly community boosted their own prestige by claiming to be among the selected members of the Brotherhood. However, it is now generally agreed among historians that there is no evidence that the order of Rosicrucians ever existed.Debus, Allen G. The Chemical Philosophy. During the mid-1630s Mersenne gave up the search for physical causes in the Aristotelian sense (rejecting the idea of ‚Äúessences‚Äù, which were still favoured by the scholastic philosophers) and taught that true physics could only be a descriptive science of motions (M√©canisme), which was the direction set by Galileo Galilei. Mersenne had been a regular correspondent with Galileo and had extended the work on vibrating strings originally developed by his father, Vincenzo Galilei.Heilbron J. L.

Definition Since 1983, the metre has been defined as \\"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of of a second\\". A millimetre, of a metre, is therefore the distance travelled by light in of a second. Informal terminology A common shortening of millimetre in spoken English is \\"mil\\".

The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the third-highest office of the Church of England (after the monarch as Supreme Governor and the Archbishop of Canterbury), and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title \\"minster\\" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum. The minster was completed in 1472 after several centuries of building. It is devoted to Saint Peter, and has a very wide Decorated Gothic nave and chapter house, a Perpendicular Gothic quire and east end and Early English North and South transepts. The nave contains the West Window, constructed in 1338, and over the Lady Chapel in the east end is the Great East Window (finished in 1408), the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the world. In the north transept is the Five Sisters Window, each lancet being over high. The south transept contains a rose window, while the West Window contains a heart-shaped design colloquially known as The Heart of Yorkshire. History A bishop of York was summoned to the Council of Arles in 314 indicating the presence of a Christian community in York at this time; however, archaeological evidence of Christianity in Roman York is limited. The first recorded church on the site was a wooden structure built hurriedly in 627 to provide a place to baptise Edwin, King of Northumbria. Moves toward a more substantial building began in the decade of the 630s. A stone structure was completed in 637 by Oswald and was dedicated to Saint Peter. The church soon fell into disrepair and was dilapidated by 670 when Saint Wilfrid ascended to the See of York. He repaired and renewed the structure. The attached school and library were established and by the 8th century were some of the most substantial in Northern Europe.The most renowned product of the school was Alcuin. In 741, the church was destroyed in a fire. It was rebuilt as a more impressive structure containing thirty altars. The church and the entire area then passed through the hands of numerous invaders, and its history is obscure until the 10th century. There were a series of Benedictine archbishops, including Saint Oswald of Worcester, Wulfstan and Ealdred, who travelled to Westminster to crown William in 1066. Ealdred died in 1069 and was buried in the church. The church was damaged in 1069 during William the Conqueror's harrying of the North, but the first Norman archbishop, Thomas of Bayeux, arriving in 1070, organised repairs. The Danes destroyed the church in 1075, but it was again rebuilt from 1080. Built in the Norman style, it was 364.173 ft (111 m) long and rendered in white and red lines. The new structure was damaged by fire in 1137 but was soon repaired. The choir and crypt were remodelled in 1154, and a new chapel was built, all in the Norman style. The Gothic style in cathedrals had arrived in the mid 12th century. Walter de Gray was made archbishop in 1215 and ordered the construction of a Gothic structure to compare to Canterbury; building began in 1220. The north and south transepts were the first new structures; completed in the 1250s, both were built in the Early English Gothic style but had markedly different wall elevations. A substantial central tower was also completed, with a wooden spire. Building continued into the 15th century. The Chapter House was begun in the 1260s and was completed before 1296. The wide nave was constructed from the 1280s on the Norman foundations. The outer roof was completed in the 1330s, but the vaulting was not finished until 1360. Construction then moved on to the eastern arm and chapels, with the last Norman structure, the choir, being demolished in the 1390s. Work here finished around 1405. In 1407 the central tower collapsed; the piers were then reinforced, and a new tower was built from 1420. The western towers were added between 1433 and 1472. The cathedral was declared complete and consecrated in 1472. The nave of York Minster The English Reformation led to the looting of much of the cathedral's treasures and the loss of much of the church lands. Under Elizabeth I there was a concerted effort to remove all traces of Roman Catholicism from the cathedral; there was much destruction of tombs, windows and altars. In the English Civil War the city was besieged and fell to the forces of Cromwell in 1644, but Thomas Fairfax prevented any further damage to the cathedral. Jonathan Martin Following the easing of religious tensions there was some work to restore the cathedral. From 1730 to 1736 the whole floor of the minster was relaid in patterned marble and from 1802 there was a major restoration. However, on 2 February 1829, an arson attack by Jonathan Martin inflicted heavy damage on the east arm. An accidental fire in 1840 left the nave, south west tower and south aisle roofless and blackened shells. The cathedral slumped deeply into debt and in the 1850s services were suspended. From 1858 Augustus Duncombe worked successfully to revive the cathedral. In 1866, there were six residentiary canonries: of which one was the Chancellor's, one the Sub-Dean's, and another annexed to the Archdeaconry of York.The Clergy List for 1866 (London: George Cox, 1866) p. 261 During the 20th century there was more concerted preservation work, especially following a 1967 survey that revealed the building, in particular the central tower, was close to collapse. ¬£2,000,000 was raised and spent by 1972 to reinforce and strengthen the building foundations and roof. During the excavations that were carried out, remains of the north corner of the Roman Principia (headquarters of the Roman fort, Eboracum) were found under the south transept. This area, as well as remains of the Norman cathedral, re-opened to the public in spring 2013 as part of the new exhibition exploring the history of the building of York Minster. =1984 fire= On 9 July 1984, York Minster suffered a serious fire in its south transept during the early morning hours. Firefighters made a decision to deliberately collapse the roof of the South Transept by pouring tens of thousands of gallons of water onto it, in order to save the rest of the building from destruction. A total of 114 firefighters from across North Yorkshire responded to the fire and contained it, while York Minster's staff and clergy rushed to preserve historical objects in the building. The glass of the South Transept rose window was shattered by the heat but the lead held it together, allowing it to be taken down for restoration. A subsequent investigation found an 80% chance that the fire was caused by a lightning strike to a metal electrical box atop the roof, a 10% chance that the fire was caused by arson, and a 10% chance that the fire was caused by an electrical fault. Some traditionalist Anglicans suggested the fire was a sign of divine displeasure at the recent consecration as Bishop of Durham of David Jenkins, whose views they considered heterodox. A repair and restoration project was completed in 1988 at a cost of ¬£2.25 million, and included new roof bosses to designs which had won a competition put on by BBC Television's Blue Peter programme for children. The roof trusses were rebuilt in oak, but some were coated with fire-retardant plaster. =2007‚Äì2018 renovation= In 2007 renovation began on the east front, including the Great East Window, at an estimated cost of ¬£23 million. The 311 glass panels from the Great East Window were removed in 2008 for conservation. The project was completed in 2018. =Schools= There have been choir schools associated with the Minster since the 7th century. A 'song school' was founded in 627 by Paulinus of York, the first Archbishop of York. Buildings used by the current school have been awarded listed status, among them the school house built 1830‚Äì33, two houses dating back to 1837, and a Georgian building of 1755. Architecture of the present building York Minster is the second-largest Gothic cathedral of Northern Europe and clearly charts the development of English Gothic architecture from Early English through to the Perpendicular Period. The present building was begun in about 1230 and completed in 1472. York is the largest cathedral completed during the Gothic period of architecture, Cologne Cathedral only being completed in 1880, after being left uncompleted for 350 years. It has a cruciform plan with an octagonal chapter house attached to the north transept, a central tower and two towers at the west front. The stone used for the building is magnesian limestone, a creamy-white coloured rock that was quarried in nearby Tadcaster. The Minster is long and the central tower has a height of . The choir has an interior height of . The north and south transepts were the first parts of the new church to be built. They have simple lancet windows, including the Five Sisters in the north transept. These are five lancets, each tall and five feet wide and glazed with grey (grisaille) glass,Sara N. James, Art in England: The Saxons to the Tudors: 600‚Äì1600 (Oxbow books, 2016) page 105 rather than narrative scenes or symbolic motifs that are usually seen in medieval stained-glass windows. In the south transept is a rose window whose glass dates from about 1500 and commemorates the union of the royal houses of York and Lancaster. The roofs of the transepts are of wood; that of the south transept was burnt in the fire of 1984 and was replaced in the restoration work which was completed in 1988. New designs were used for the bosses, five of which were designed by winners of a competition organised by the BBC's Blue Peter television programme. Work began on the chapter house and its vestibule that links it to the north transept after the transepts were completed. The style of the chapter house is of the early Decorated Period where geometric patterns were used in the tracery of the windows, which were wider than those of early styles. However, the work was completed before the appearance of the ogee curve, an S-shaped double curve which was extensively used at the end of this period. The windows cover almost all of the upper wall space, filling the chapter house with light. The chapter house is octagonal, as is the case in many cathedrals, but is notable in that it has no central column supporting the roof. The wooden roof, which was of an innovative design, is light enough to be able to be supported by the buttressed walls. The chapter house has many sculptured heads above the canopies, representing some of the finest Gothic sculpture in the country. There are human heads, no two alike, and some pulling faces; angels; animals and grotesques. Unique to the transepts and chapter house is the use of Purbeck marble to adorn the piers, adding to the richness of decoration. The nave was built between 1291 and and is also in the decorated Gothic style. It is the widest Gothic nave in England and has a wooden roof (painted so as to appear like stone) and the aisles have vaulted stone roofs. At its west end is the Great West Window, known as the 'Heart of Yorkshire', second-largest among the church's 128 windows. This window was designed and built along with the rest of the west front by the master mason Ivo de Raghton in 1338‚Äì39. The tracery is in the Flamboyant or Curvilinear Decorated style of English Gothic architecture.York Minster site: the Great West Window ‚Äì Fact Sheet 7 Because of deterioration of stone mullions, the tracery was replaced in the late 1980s with an exact copy. The east end of the Minster was built between 1361 and 1405 in the Perpendicular Gothic style. Despite the change in style, noticeable in details such as the tracery and capitals, the eastern arm preserves the pattern of the nave. The east end contains a four-bay choir; a second set of transepts, projecting only above half-height; and the Lady Chapel. The transepts are in line with the high altar and serve to throw light onto it. Behind the high altar is the Great East Window, the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the world, which is currently undergoing a massive conservation project, due to be completed in 2015‚Äì16. Below the Great East Window currently sits the Orb, a stainless steel dome which opened at the end of October 2012, containing five of the conserved panels from the window, one of which is changed each month. The Orb enables visitors to see the work of renowned medieval artist, John Thornton, up close, revealing the remarkable detail in each panel. The sparsely decorated Central Tower was built between 1407 and 1472 and is also in the Perpendicular style. Below this, separating the choir from the crossing and nave is the striking 15th-century choir screen. It contains sculptures of the kings of England from William the Conqueror to Henry VI with stone and gilded canopies set against a red background. Above the screen is the organ, which dates from 1832. The West Towers, in contrast with the Central Tower, are heavily decorated and are topped with battlements and eight pinnacles each, again in the Perpendicular style. In 2003, English Heritage made publicly available a monograph on the architectural history of York Minster. The book charts the construction and development of the minster based on the architectural recording of the building from the 1970s.

The glass was painted, fired, then joined together with lead strips (came) into the windows. The tall and wide Great East Window was created by John Thornton in the early 15th century; he was paid ¬£66 for the work. This is the largest expanse of medieval stained glass in the country, according to the Minster. Another important window is the tall Five Sisters window. Because of the extended time periods during which the glass was installed, different types of glazing and painting techniques are visible in the different windows. Approximately two million individual pieces of glass make up the cathedral's stained-glass windows. The windows were removed in 1916 because of the fear of bombing during the First World War and the \\"Five Sisters Window\\" was restored in 1925 with ¬£3,500 raised by Almyra Gray and Helen Little. The glass was removed again during the Second World War. In 2008 a conservation project of the Great East Window commenced, involving the removal, repainting and re-leading of each individual panel. While the window was in storage in the minster's stonemasons' yard, a fire broke out in some adjoining offices, due to an electrical fault, on 30 December 2009. The window's 311 panes, stored in a neighbouring room, were undamaged and were successfully moved to safety. In September 2015, the first phase of the renovation project of the East Front of the Minster was completed. The final phase of the ¬£11 million restoration of the 311 panels was completed in September 2017 and they were re-installed between November 2017 and January 2018. In total, the work on the Great East Window had taken 92,400 hours of labour, including the time required to add protective UV coating on the glass. =Towers and bells= The two west towers of the minster hold bells, clock chimes and a concert carillon. The north-west tower contains Great Peter (216 cwt or 10.8 tons) and the six clock bells (the largest weighing just over 60 cwt or 3 tons). The south-west tower holds 14 bells (tenor 59 cwt or 3 tons) hung and rung for change ringing and 22 carillon bells (tenor 23 cwt or 1.2 tons) which are played from a baton keyboard in the ringing chamber (all together 35 bells.) Low Petergate with the Minster towers in the background The clock bells ring every quarter of an hour during the daytime and Great Peter strikes the hour. The change ringing bells fell silent in October 2016, following the controversial termination of the ringers' volunteer agreements by the dean and chapter. The pause in ringing included the Christmas period of 2016, reported as the first time in over 600 years that the Minster's bells were not heard on Christmas Day. After a year with no change ringing, a new band was appointed and ringing resumed. York Minster became the first cathedral in England to have a carillon of bells with the arrival of a further twenty-four small bells on 4 April 2008. These are added to the existing \\"Nelson Chime\\" which is chimed to announce Evensong around 5.00 pm each day, giving a carillon of 35 bells in total (three chromatic octaves). The new bells were cast at the Loughborough Bell Foundry of John Taylor & Co, where all of the existing minster bells were cast. The new carillon is a gift to the minster. It will be the first new carillon in the British Isles for 40 years and first hand played carillon in an English cathedral. Before Evensong each evening, hymn tunes are played on a baton keyboard connected with the bells, but occasionally anything from Beethoven to the Beatles may be heard. =Shrines= When Thomas Becket was murdered and subsequently enshrined at Canterbury, York found itself with a rival major draw for pilgrims. More specifically, pilgrims spent money and would leave gifts for the support of the cathedral. Hence Walter de Gray, supported by the King, petitioned the Pope. On 18 March 1226, Pope Honorius issued a letter to the effect that the name of William (Fitzherbert), formerly Archbishop of York, was \\"inscribed in the catalogue of the Saints of the Church Militant.\\" Thus there was now St William of York (whose name is perhaps more often associated with the adjacent St William's College). York had its saint but it took until 1279, when William de Wickwane (William de Wykewayne) was elected archbishop, for the remains of the canonised William to be transferred to a shrine prepared for them behind the high altar.Purey-Cust, A. P. The Very Reverend Dean York Minster (1897) Isbister & Co This was placed on a platform raised upon the arches of the crypt removed to this position for that purpose. On 29 December King Edward I himself, together with the bishops who were present, carried on their shoulder the chest or feretory containing the relics to their new resting-place and Anthony Beck, consecrated the same day as Bishop of Durham, paid all the expenses. The tomb of Walter de Gray was erected in the south transept. His remains were interred on \\"the vigil of Pentecost, 1255\\" under his effigy \\"in full canonicals\\" carved in Purbeck marble under a canopy resting on ten light pillars. It was subsequently somewhat hidden behind a screen of ironwork erected by Archbishop William Markham in the early 19th century.

This organ was reconstructed in 1859 by William Hill and Sons. The case remained intact, but the organ was mechanically new, retaining the largest pipes of the former instrument. In 1903, J. W. Walker and Sons built a new instrument in the same case. They retained several registers from the previous instrument. Some work was undertaken in 1918 by Harrison & Harrison when the Tuba Mirabilis was added and the Great chorus revised. The same firm rebuilt this Walker-Harrison instrument in 1931 when a new console and electro-pneumatic action were added together with four new stops. The smaller solo tubas were enclosed in the solo box. In 1960, J. W. Walker & Sons restored the actions, lowered wind pressures and introduced mutations and higher chorus work in the spirit of the neo- classical movement. They cleaned the organ in 1982. The fire of 1984 affected the organ but not irreparably; the damage hastened the time for a major restoration, which was begun in 1991 and finished two years later by Principal Pipe Organs of York, under the direction of their founder, Geoffrey Coffin, who had at one time been assistant organist at the Minster. In 2018, a ¬£2 million project to refurbish the current organ was announced. The project will take two years to complete and will see nearly all of its 5,403 pipes removed and taken to organ specialists Harrison and Harrison in Durham.

The current Organist and Director of Music of the Minster is Robert Sharpe. There is also an Assistant Director of Music, Ben Morris. Among the notable organists of York Minster are four members of the Camidge family, who served as the cathedral's organists for over 100 years, and a number of composers including John Naylor, T. Tertius Noble, Edward Bairstow, Francis Jackson, and Philip Moore.

The clock is a memorial to the airmen operating from bases in Yorkshire, County Durham and Northumberland who were killed in action during the Second World War. Illuminations The West Door, illuminated in December 2005 In November 2002, York Minster was illuminated in colour, devised by York-born Mark Brayshaw, for the first time in its history. The occasion was televised live on the BBC1 Look North programme. Similar illuminations have been projected over the Christmas period in subsequent years. York Minster was also artistically illuminated on 5 November 2005, celebrating the 400th anniversary of the foiling of York-born Guy Fawkes' gunpowder plot. This was done by Patrice Warrener using his unique \\"chromolithe\\" technique with which he 'paints' with light, picking out sculpted architectural details. In October 2010, York Minster's south transept was selected for \\"Rose\\", a son et lumiere created by international artists Ross Ashton and Karen Monid which lit up the entire exterior of the south transept of the minster and illuminated the Rose Window. There were also satellite illuminate events in Dean's Park. York Mystery Plays In 2000, the Dean and Chapter allowed the York Mystery Plays to be performed for the first time inside the Minster, directed by Greg Doran.Archive of Mystery Plays at National Centre for Early Music. The Plays returned to the Minster for a second time in 2016, directed by Phillip Breen with Philip McGinley performing the role of Jesus.

It is one of the finest examples of Norman architecture in Britain, and has probably the largest Romanesque crossing tower in Europe. Tewkesbury had been a centre for worship since the 7th century, becoming a priory in the 10th. The present building was started in the early 12th century. It was unsuccessfully used as a sanctuary in the Wars of the Roses. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries it became the parish church for the town. George Gilbert Scott led Restoration in the late 19th century. The church and churchyard within the abbey precincts includes tombs and memorials to many of the aristocracy of the area. Services have been high church but now include Parish Eucharist, choral Mass and Evensong. These are accompanied by one of the church's three organs and choirs. There is a ring of twelve bells, hung for change ringing. History Oddo and Doddo, brothers and Dukes of Mercia, Saxon founders of Tewkesbury Abbey. Latin titulus above: Oddo : Doddo duc(es) duas Marciorum et primi fundatores Teokburie (\\"Oddo & Doddo two Earls of the Marches and first founders of Tewkesbury\\"). Each knight is in armour and bears in his hand a model of a church. Both are supporting a shield (affixed to a pomegranate tree) bearing the attributed arms of themselves and of the Abbey Gules, a cross raguly or.Otherwise: Gules, a cross engrailed or Tewkesbury Abbey Founders Book, folio 8 verso, Bodleian Library, Oxford The tall Norman arch of the facade is unique in England The Chronicle of Tewkesbury records that the first Christian worship was brought to the area by Theoc, a missionary from Northumbria, who built his cell in the mid-7th century near a gravel spit where the Severn and Avon rivers join together. The cell was succeeded by a monastery in 715, but nothing remaining of it has been identified. In the 10th century the religious foundation at Tewkesbury became a priory subordinate to the Benedictine Cranborne Abbey in Dorset. In 1087, William the Conqueror gave the manor of Tewkesbury to his cousin, Robert Fitzhamon, who, with Giraldus, Abbot of Cranborne, founded the present abbey in 1092. Building of the present Abbey church did not start until 1102, employing Caen stone imported from Normandy and floated up the Severn. Robert Fitzhamon was wounded at Falaise in Normandy in 1105 and died two years later, but his son-in-law, Robert FitzRoy, the natural son of Henry I who was made Earl of Gloucester, continued to fund the building work. The Abbey's greatest single later patron was Lady Eleanor le Despenser, last of the De Clare heirs of FitzRoy. In the High Middle Ages, Tewkesbury became one of the richest abbeys of England. After the Battle of Tewkesbury in the Wars of the Roses on 4 May 1471, some of the defeated Lancastrians sought sanctuary in the abbey. The victorious Yorkists, led by King Edward IV, forced their way into the abbey; the resulting bloodshed caused the building to be closed for a month until it could be purified and re-consecrated. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the last abbot, John Wakeman, surrendered the abbey to the commissioners of King Henry VIII on 9 January 1539. Perhaps because of his cooperation with the proceedings, he was awarded an annuity of 400 marks and was ordained as the first Bishop of Gloucester in September 1541. Meanwhile, the people of Tewkesbury saved the abbey from destruction. Insisting that it was their parish church which they had the right to keep, they bought it from the Crown for the value of its bells and lead roof which would have been salvaged and melted down, leaving the structure a roofless ruin. The price came to ¬£453. The bells merited their own free-standing belltower, an unusual feature in English sites. After the Dissolution, the bell-tower was used as the gaol for the borough until it was demolished in the late 18th century. The central stone tower was originally topped with a wooden spire, which collapsed in 1559 and was never rebuilt. Restoration undertaken in the late 19th century under Sir George Gilbert Scott was reopened on 23 September 1879. Work continued under the direction of his son John Oldrid Scott until 1910 and included the rood screen of 1892. Flood waters from the nearby River Severn reached inside the Abbey during severe floods in 1760, and again on 23 July 2007. =Construction time-line= Arms of Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester, Founders Book of Tewkesbury Abbey, c. 1525 * 23 October 1121 ‚Äì the choir consecrated * 1150 ‚Äì tower and nave completed * 1178 ‚Äì large fire necessitated some rebuilding * ~1235 ‚Äì Chapel of St Nicholas built * ~1300 ‚Äì Chapel of St. James built * 1321‚Äì1335 ‚Äì choir rebuilt with radiating chantry chapels * 1349‚Äì59 ‚Äì tower and nave vaults rebuilt; the lierne vaults of the nave replacing wooden roofing * 1400‚Äì1410 ‚Äì cloisters rebuilt * 1438 ‚Äì Chapel of Isabel (Countess of Warwick) built * 1471 ‚Äì Battle of Tewkesbury; bloodshed within church so great that it is closed for purification The building The nave of Tewkesbury Abbey Garter banner of the late Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay in Tewkesbury Abbey The church itself is one of the finest Norman buildings in England.

Fourteen of England's cathedrals are of smaller dimensions, while only Westminster Abbey contains more medieval church monuments. Notable monuments Notable church monuments surviving in Tewkesbury Abbey include: * 1107 ‚Äì when the abbey's founder Robert Fitzhamon died in 1107, he was buried in the chapter house while his son-in-law Robert FitzRoy, Earl of Gloucester (an illegitimate son of King Henry I), continued building the abbey * 1375 ‚Äì Edward Despenser, Lord of the Manor of Tewkesbury, is remembered today chiefly for the effigy on his monument, which shows him in full colour kneeling on top of the canopy of his chantry, facing toward the high altar * 1395 ‚Äì Robert Fitzhamon's remains were moved into a new chapel built as his tomb * 1471 ‚Äì a brass plate on the floor in the centre of the sanctuary marks the grave of Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, the son of King Henry VI and end of the Lancastrian line, who was killed in the Battle of Tewkesbury ‚Äì the only Prince of Wales ever to die in battle. He was aged only 17 at his death. * 1478 ‚Äì the bones of George, Duke of Clarence (brother of Edward IV and Richard III), and his wife Isabel (daughter of \\"Warwick, the Kingmaker\\") are housed behind a glass window in a wall of their inaccessible burial vault behind the high altar * 1539 ‚Äì the cadaver monument which Abbot Wakeman had erected for himself is only a cenotaph because he was not buried there * Also buried in the abbey are several members of the Despenser, de Clare and Beauchamp families, all of whom were generous benefactors of the abbey. Such members include Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick, and his wife, Cecily Neville, Duchess of Warwick, sister of \\"Warwick, the Kingmaker\\".

The bells at the Abbey were overhauled in 1962. The ring is now made up of twelve bells, hung for change ringing, cast in 1962, by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. The inscriptions of the old 5th and 10th bells are copied in facsimile onto the new bells. The bells have modern cast iron headstocks and all run on self-aligning ball bearings. They are hung in the north-east corner of the tower, and the ringing chamber is partitioned off from the rest of the tower. A semitone bell was added (Flat 6th) also cast by Taylor of Loughborough in 1991, this is numbered 5a making the total 13 available to campanologists. The Old Clock Bells are the old 6th (Abraham Rudhall II, 1725), the old 7th (Abraham Rudhall I, 1696), the old 8th (Abraham Rudhall I, 1696) and the old 11th (Abraham Rudhall I, 1717). In St Dunstan's Chapel, at the east end of the Abbey, is a small disused bell inscribed T. MEARS FECT. 1837. The Abbey bells are rung from 10:15am to 11:00am every Sunday except the first Sunday of the month (a quarter peal). There is also ringing for Evensong from 4:00pm to 5:00pm, except on the third Sunday (a quarter peal) and most fifth Sundays. Practice takes place each Thursday from 7:30pm to 9:00pm. Churchyard The churchyard contains war graves of two World War II Royal Air Force personnel. Abbey precincts The market town of Tewkesbury developed to the north of the abbey precincts, of which vestiges remain in the layout of the streets and a few buildings: the Abbot's gatehouse, the Almonry barn, the Abbey Mill, Abbey House, the present vicarage and some half-timbered dwellings in Church Street. The Abbey now sits partly isolated in lawns, like a cathedral in its cathedral close, for the area surrounding the Abbey is protected from development by the Abbey Lawn Trust, originally funded by a United States benefactor in 1962..

Choirs The Abbey possesses, in effect, two choirs. The Abbey Choir sings at Sunday services, with children (boys and girls) and adults in the morning, and adults in the evening. Schola Cantorum is a professional choir of men and boys based at Dean Close Preparatory School and sings at weekday Evensongs as well as occasional masses and concerts. The Abbey School Tewkesbury, which educated, trained and provided choristers to sing the service of Evensong from its foundation in 1973 by Miles Amherst, closed in 2006; the choir was then re-housed at Dean Close School, Cheltenham, and renamed the Tewkesbury Abbey Schola Cantorum. Worship Vault detail For the most part, worship at the Abbey has been emphatically High Anglican. However, in more recent times there has been an acknowledgement of the value of less solemn worship, and this is reflected in the two congregational services offered on Sunday mornings. The first of these (at 9.15am) is a Parish Eucharist, with modern language and an informal atmosphere; a parish breakfast is typically served after this service. The main Sung Eucharist at 11am is solemn and formal, including a choral Mass; traditional language is used throughout, and most parts of the service are indeed sung, including the Collect and Gospel reading. Choral Evensong is sung on Sunday evenings, and also on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday during the week. A said Eucharist also takes place every day of the week, at varying times, and alternating between traditional and modern language. Each summer since 1969 (with the exception of 2007 when the town was hit by floods) the Abbey has played host to Musica Deo Sacra, a festival combining music and liturgy. Photography in the Abbey is restricted.Note: Photography is permitted in the Abbey but requires purchase of a day permit. Photography is not permitted, however, during services or within the sanctuary of the altar and is not permitted for publication or commercial gain without written permission of the vicar or churchwardens.

For example, the standard notebook and school exercise book of the ancient world was a diptych consisting of a pair of such plates that contained a recessed space filled with wax. Writing was accomplished by scratching the wax surface with a stylus. When the notes were no longer needed, the wax could be slightly heated and then smoothed to allow reuse. Ordinary versions had wooden frames, but more luxurious diptychs were crafted with more expensive materials. Art Diptych with the Coronation of the Virgin and the Last Judgment, Metropolitan Museum of Art As an art term a diptych is an artwork consisting of two pieces or panels, that together create a singular art piece these can be attached together or presented adjoining each other. In medieval times, panels were often hinged so that they could be closed and the artworks protected. In Late Antiquity, ivory notebook diptychs with covers carved in low relief on the outer faces were a significant art-form: the \\"consular diptych\\" was made to celebrate an individual's becoming Roman consul, when they seem to have been made in sets and distributed by the new consul to friends and followers. Others may have been made to celebrate a wedding, or, perhaps like the Poet and Muse diptych at Monza, simply commissioned for private use. Some of the most important surviving works of the Late Roman Empire are diptychs, of which some dozens survive, preserved in some instances by being reversed and re-used as book covers. The largest surviving Byzantine ivory panel (428 mm √ó 143 mm), is a leaf from a diptych in the Justinian court manner of c. 525‚Äì50, which features an archangel. ‚Ä¢ From the Middle Ages many panel paintings took the diptych form, as small portable works for personal use; Eastern Orthodox ones may be called \\"travelling icons\\". Although the tryptych form was more common, there were also ivory diptychs with religious scenes carved in relief, a form found first in Byzantine art before becoming very popular in the Gothic period in the West, where they were mainly produced in Paris. These suited the mobile lives of medieval elites. The ivories tended to have scenes in several registers (vertical layers) crowded with small figures. The paintings generally had single subjects on a panel, the two matching, though by the 15th century one panel (usually the left one) might contain a portrait head of the owner or commissioner, with the Virgin or another religious subject on the other side. The outsides, which often received considerable wear from travelling, might have simpler decorative designs, including the coat of arms of the owner. Large altarpieces tended to be made in triptych form, with two outer panels that could be closed across the main central representation. They are one type of the multi-panel forms of painting known as polyptychs. The diptych was a common format in Early Netherlandish painting and depicted subjects ranging from secular portraiture to religious personages and stories. Often a portrait and a Madonna and Child had a leaf each. It was especially popular in the 15th and 16th centuries. Painters such as Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling and Hugo van der Goes used the form. Some modern artists have used the term in the title of works consisting of two paintings never actually connected, but intended to be hung close together as a pair, such as Andy Warhol‚Äôs Marilyn Diptych (1962)Marilyn Diptych (1962) Tate Collection Online which is a modern pop culture icon. \\"Diptych\\" is also often used in reference to films or pieces of literature that form a complementary pair. When taken together, they are viewed as illuminating each other and comprising a distinct work of art from the individual parts. An example is the pair of Alan Ayckbourn plays, House and Garden. Ecclesiastical Deesis, 17th-century icon. Left to right: Archangel Michael, Theotokos, John the Baptist, Archangel Gabriel (Historical Museum in Sanok, Poland). It is in this form that the mention of \\"diptychs\\" in early Christian literature is found. The term refers to official lists of the living and departed that are commemorated by the local church. The living would be inscribed on one wing of the diptych, and the departed on the other. The inscribing of a bishop's name in the diptychs means that the local church considers itself to be in communion with him, the removal of a bishop's name would indicate breaking communion with him. The names in the diptychs would be read publicly by the deacon during the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist), and by the priest during the Liturgy of Preparation. Diptychs were also used to inscribe the names of the saints. Although the wax tablets themselves are no longer used, the term is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches to describe the contents of the diptychs, with all the same connotations. Ethiopian Orthodox wooden diptych of St. Mary and the infant Jesus with archangels above them. St. George appears on a white horse on the left. (Late 16th-early 17th century) Diptych sundial Diptych sundial in the form of a lute, circa 1612. A face was on the inside of each leaf. One leaf formed a vertical sundial, the other a horizontal sundial. The shadow caster, or gnomon was a string between them, and calibrated as to how far they should open, as the angle is critical. Such a sundial can be adjusted to any latitude by tilting it so its gnomon is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation. A common error states that if both dials show the same time, the instrument is oriented correctly and faces north (in the northern hemisphere). A Diptych made as stated as a combined vertical and horizontal sundial with a string gnomon will show the same time on both dials regardless of orientation. This property of self alignment is only true for diptychs historically in the case for a combination of an analemmatic and a vertical sundial. A double dial on a flat plate consisting of a horizontal and an analemmatic dial will also be aligned properly if both dials show the same time. Some diptychs had rough calendars, in the form of pelekinons calibrated to a nodus in the form of a bead or knot on the string. These are accurate to about a week, which was good enough to time planting of crops.

The black line indicates Stanley's route. Lake Victoria (; ; also Ukerewe) is one of the African Great Lakes. The lake was named after Queen Victoria by the explorer John Hanning Speke, in his reports‚Äîthe first Briton to document it. Speke accomplished this in 1858, while on an expedition with Richard Francis Burton to locate the source of the Nile River. This expedition was financially sponsored by the Royal Geographic Society. With a surface area of approximately , Lake Victoria is Africa's largest lake by area, the world's largest tropical lake, and the world's second-largest fresh water lake by surface area after Lake Superior in North America. In terms of volume, Lake Victoria is the world's ninth-largest continental lake, containing about of water. Lake Victoria occupies a shallow depression in Africa. The lake has a maximum depth of between and an average depth of .United Nations, Development and Harmonisation of Environmental Laws Volume 1: Report on the Legal and Institutional Issues in the Lake Victoria Basin, United Nations, 1999, page 17 Its catchment area covers . The lake has a shoreline of when digitized at the 1:25,000 level, with islands constituting 3.7% of this length. The lake's area is divided among three countries: Kenya occupies 6% (), Uganda 45% (), and Tanzania 49% ().J. Prado, R.J. Beare, J. Siwo Mbuga & L.E. Oluka, 1991.

Rome, Food and Agricultural Organization. The lake includes many species of fish that inhabit nowhere else, especially cichlids. Invasive fish, such as the Nile perch, have driven many endemic species to extinction. Geology Topographical map of Lake Victoria Geologically, Lake Victoria is relatively young at about 400,000 years old. It formed when westward-flowing rivers were dammed by an upthrown crustal block. During its geological history, Lake Victoria went through changes ranging from its present shallow depression, through to what may have been a series of much smaller lakes. Geological cores taken from its bottom show Lake Victoria has dried up completely at least three times since it formed. These drying cycles are probably related to past ice ages, which were times when precipitation declined globally. Lake Victoria last dried out about 17,300 years ago, and it refilled 14,700 years ago as the African humid period began. Hydrology and limnology Lake Victoria receives 80 percent of its water from direct rainfall. Average evaporation on the lake is between per year, almost double the precipitation of riparian areas. Lake Victoria receives its water additionally from rivers, and thousands of small streams. The Kagera River is the largest river flowing into this lake, with its mouth on the lake's western shore. Lake Victoria is drained solely by the Nile River near Jinja, Uganda, on the lake's northern shore. In the Kenya sector, the main influent rivers are the Sio, Nzoia, Yala, Nyando, Sondu Miriu, Mogusi, and Migori. Lake Victoria and the Great Rift Valley The only outflow from Lake Victoria is the Nile River, which exits the lake near Jinja, Uganda. In terms of contributed water, this makes Lake Victoria the principal source of the longest branch of the Nile. However, the most distal source of the Nile Basin, and therefore the ultimate source of the Nile, is more often considered to be one of the tributary rivers of the Kagera River (the exact tributary remains undetermined), and which originates in either Rwanda or Burundi. The uppermost section of the Nile is generally known as the Victoria Nile until it reaches Lake Albert. Although it is a part of the same river system known as the White Nile and is occasionally referred to as such, strictly speaking this name does not apply until after the river crosses the Uganda border into South Sudan to the north. The lake exhibits eutrophic conditions. In 1990‚Äì1991, oxygen concentrations in the mixed layer were higher than in 1960‚Äì1961, with nearly continuous oxygen supersaturation in surface waters. Oxygen concentrations in hypolimnetic waters (i.e. the layer of water that lies below the thermocline, is noncirculating, and remains perpetually cold) were lower in 1990‚Äì1991 for a longer period than in 1960‚Äì1961, with values of less than 1 mg per litre (< 0.4 gr/cu ft) occurring in water as shallow as compared with a shallowest occurrence of greater than in 1961. The changes in oxygenation are considered consistent with measurements of higher algal biomass and productivity. These changes have arisen for multiple reasons: successive burning within its basin, soot and ash from which has been deposited over the lake's wide area; from increased nutrient inflows via rivers, and from increased pollution associated with settlement along its shores.  Bathymetry  Lake Victoria bathymetric model The lake is considered a shallow lake considering its large geographic area with a maximum depth of approximately and an average depth of . A 2016 project digitized ten-thousand points and created the first true bathymetric map of the lake. The deepest part of the lake is offset to the east of the lake near Kenya and the lake is generally shallower in the west along the Ugandan shoreline and the south along the Tanzanian shoreline. Native wildlife =Mammals= Many mammal species live in the region of Lake Victoria, and some of these are closely associated with the lake itself and the nearby wetlands. Among these are the hippopotamus, African clawless otter, spotted-necked otter, marsh mongoose, sitatunga, bohor reedbuck, defassa waterbuck, cane rats, and giant otter shrew.Kingdon, J. (1997). The Kingdon Guide to African Mammals. Academic Press Limited, London. . =Reptiles= Lake Victoria and its wetlands has a large population of Nile crocodiles, as well as African helmeted turtles, variable mud turtles, and Williams' mud turtle.Spawls, Howell, Drewes, and Ashe (2002). A Field Guide to the Reptiles of East Africa. Academic Press, London. . The Williams' mud turtle is restricted to Lake Victoria and other lakes, rivers, and swamps in the upper Nile basin. =Cichlid fish= Unlike many other Lake Victoria cichlids, Haplochromis nyererei remains common. Compared to several other cichlids, its eyes are particularly sensitive to light, especially red, which is less affected by the decrease in water clarity caused by eutrophication than short wavelength colors Lake Victoria formerly was very rich in fish, including many endemics, but a high percentage of these became extinct during the last 50 years. The main group in Lake Victoria is the haplochromine cichlids (Haplochromis sensu lato) with more than 500 species, almost all endemic,DeWeerdt, S. (28 February 2004). Dark secret of the lake. New Scientist. Retrieved 26 March 2017. and including an estimated 300 that still are undescribed.Sayer, C.A., L. M√°iz-Tom√©, and W.R.T. Darwall (2018). Freshwater biodiversity in the Lake Victoria Basin: Guidance for species conservation, site protection, climate resilience and sustainable livelihoods. Cambridge, UK and Gland, Switzerland: IUCN. This is far more species of fish than any other lake in the world, except Lake Malawi. These are the result of a rapid adaptive radiation in the last circa 15,000 years. Their extraordinary diversity and speed of evolution have been the subjects for many scientists studying the forces that drive the richness of life everywhere. The Victoria haplochromines are part of an older group of more than 700 closely related species, also including those of several smaller lakes in the region, notably Kyoga, Edward‚ÄìGeorge, Albert, and Kivu. Most of these lakes are relatively shallow (like Victoria) and part of the present-day upper Nile basin. The exception is Lake Kivu, which is part of the present-day Congo River basin, but is believed to have been connected to Lakes Edward and Victoria by rivers until the uplifting of parts of the East African Rift. This deep lake may have functioned as an \\"evolutionary reservoir\\" for this haplochromine group in periods where other shallower lakes in the region dried out, as happened to Lake Victoria about 15,000 years ago. In recent history only Lake Kyoga was easily accessible to Victoria cichlids, as further downstream movement by the Victoria Nile (to Lake Albert) is prevented by a series of waterfalls, notably Murchison. In contrast, the Owen Falls (now flooded by a dam) between Victoria and Kyoga were essentially a series of rapids that did not effectively block fish movements between the two lakes.McClanahan, T. and T.P. Young (1996). East African Ecosystems and Their Conservation. pp. 201‚Äì06. Haplochromis thereuterion survives in low numbers. Initially feared extinct, when rediscovered it had changed habitat (from near surface to rocky outcrops) and feeding behavior (from surface insects to insect larvae)Steeves, G: \\"'Haplochromis' thereuterion\\". Cichlid-Forum. Retrieved 28 March 2017. The Victoria haplochromines are distinctly sexually dimorphic (males relatively brightly colored; females dull), and their ecology is extremely diverse, falling into at least 16 groups, including detritivores, zooplanktivores, insectivores, prawn-eaters, molluscivores and piscivores. As a result of predation by the introduced Nile perch, eutrophication and other changes to the ecosystem, it is estimated that at least 200 species (about 40 percent) of Lake Victoria haplochromines have become extinct, including more than 100 undescribed species. Initially it was feared that this number was even higher, by some estimates 65 percent of the total species, but several species that were feared extinct have been rediscovered after the Nile perch started to decline in the 1990s.IUCN Red Lists: Geographic Patterns. Eastern Africa. Retrieved 25 March 2017. Several of the remaining species are seriously threatened and additional extinctions are possible.Fiedler, P.L. and P M. Kareiva, editors (1998). Conservation Biology: For the Coming Decade. 2nd edition. pp. 209‚Äì10. Some species have survived in nearby small satellite lakes, have survived in refugias among rocks or papyrus sedges (protecting them from the Nile perch), or have adapted to the human-induced changes in the lake itself. Such adaptions include a larger gill area (adaption for oxygen- poor water), changes in the feeding apparatus, changes to the eyes (giving them a better sight in turbid water) and smaller head/larger caudal peduncle (allowing faster swimming). The piscivorous (affected by both predation and competition from Nile perch), molluscivorous and insectivorous haplochromines were particularly hard hit with many extinctions. Others have become extinct in their pure form, but survive as hybrids between close relatives (especially among the detritivores). The zooplanktivores have been least affected and in the late 1990s had reached densities similar to, or above, the densities before the drastic declines, although consisting of fewer species and often switching their diet towards macroinvertebrates. Some of the threatened Lake Victoria cichlid species have captive \\"insurance\\" populations in zoos, public aquaria and among private aquarists, and a few species are extinct in the wild (only survive in captivity).Yirka, B.

Before the mass extinction that has occurred among the lake's cichlids in the last 50 years, about 90 percent of the native fish species in the lake were haplochromines. Disregarding the haplochromines, the only native Victoria cichlids are two critically endangered tilapia, the Singida tilapia or ngege (Oreochromis esculentus) and Victoria tilapia (O. variabilis). In 1927-1928 Michael Graham conducted the first ever systematic Fisheries Survey of Lake Victoria. In his official report of the expedition, Graham wrote that \\"The ngege or satu Tilapia esculenta, is the most important food fish of the lake, whether for native or non-native consumption. No other fish equals it in the quality of the flesh. It is convenient size for trade, travels well and is found in much greater numbers than other important fish, such as semutundu (Luganda), Bagrus sp.\\".Graham M. (1929.) The Victoria Nyanza and Its Fisheries: A Report on the Fish Survey of Lake Victoria 1927‚Äì1928 and Appendices. London: Crown Agents for the Colonies. 256pp. Furthermore, Graham noted that the introduction of the European flax gill net of 5 inch mesh had undoubtedly caused a diminution in the number of ngege in those parts of the Kavirondo Gulf, the northern shore of the lake, the Sesse Islands and Smith's Sound which are conveniently situated close to markets. Survey catches in 1927-28 included several Haplochromis species that are now thought to be extinct, including: Haplochromis flavipinnis, Haplochromis gowersii, Haplochromis longirostris, Haplochromis macrognathus, Haplochromis michaeli, Haplochromis nigrescens, Haplochromis prognathus. As well as being due to the introduction of Nile Perch, the extinction of cichlids in the genus Haplochromis has also been blamed on the lake's eutrophication. The fertility of tropical waters depends on the rate at which nutrients can be brought into solution. The influent rivers of Lake Victoria provide few nutrients to the lake in relation to its size. Because of this, most of Lake Victoria's nutrients are thought to be locked up in lake-bottom deposits. By itself, this vegetative matter decays slowly. Animal flesh decays considerably faster, however, so the fertility of the lake is dependent on the rate at which these nutrients can be taken up by fish and other organisms. There is little doubt that Haplochromis played an important role in returning detritus and plankton back into solution. With some 80 percent of Haplochromis species feeding off detritus, and equally capable of feeding off one another, they represented a tight, internal recycling system, moving nutrients and biomass both vertically and horizontally through the water column, and even out of the lake via predation by humans and terrestrial animals. The removal of Haplochromis, however, may have contributed to the increasing frequency of algal blooms, which may in turn be responsible for mass fish kills. =Other fish= The non-cichlid native fish include African tetras (Brycinus), cyprinids (Enteromius, Garra, Labeo, Labeobarbus, Rastrineobola and Xenobarbus), airbreathing catfish (Clariallabes, Clarias and Xenoclarias), bagrid catfish (Bagrus), loach catfish (Amphilius and Zaireichthys), silver butter catfish (Schilbe intermedius), Synodontis squeaker catfish, Nothobranchius killifish, poeciliids (Aplocheilichthys and Micropanchax), the spiny eel Mastacembelus frenatus, elephantfish (Gnathonemus, Hippopotamyrus, Marcusenius, Mormyrus, Petrocephalus, and Pollimyrus), the climbing gourami Ctenopoma muriei and marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus).FishBase: Fish Species in Victoria. Retrieved 25 March 2017. At a genus level, most of these are widespread in Africa, but the very rare Xenobarbus and Xenoclarias are endemic to the lake, and the common Rastrineobola is near-endemic. =Crustaceans= Four species of freshwater crabs are known from Lake Victoria: Potamonautes niloticus is widespread in the lake and P. emini has been recorded from the vicinity of Bukoba in Tanzania, but both are also found elsewhere in Africa.Cumberlidge, N. (2009). \\"Freshwater Crabs and Shrimps (Crustacea: Decapoda) of the Nile Basin\\". Chapter 27, pp. 547‚Äì61 in : Dumony, H.J. (editor). The Nile. Origin, Environments, Limnology and Human Use. Monographiae Biologicae, Vol. 89. Springer, New York. . The last were first scientifically described in 2017 and very little is known about them: P. entebbe is only known from near Entebbe (the only known specimen was collected in 1955 and it is unknown if it was in or near the lake) and P. busungwe only at Busungwe Island in the northwestern part of the lake. The latter likely is the smallest African freshwater crab with a carapace width up to about , although P. kantsyore of Kagera River, and Platythelphusa maculata and P. polita of Lake Tanganyika are almost as small. The only shrimp/prawn is Caridina nilotica, which is common and widespread in Lake Victoria. =Molluscs= Lake Victoria is home to 28 species of freshwater snails (e.g., Bellamya, Biomphalaria, Bulinus, Cleopatra, Gabbiella, and Melanoides), including 12 endemic species/subspecies.Brown, D. (1994). Freshwater snails of Africa and their medical importance. 2nd edition. There are 17 species of bivalves (Corbicula, Coelatura, Sphaerium, and Byssanodonta), including 6 endemic species/subspecies. It is likely that undescribed species of snails remain. Conversely, genetic studies indicate that some morphologically distinctive populations, traditionally regarded as separate species, may only be variants of single species. Two of the snail genera, Biomphalaria and Bulinus, are intermediate hosts of the parasite bilharzia (schistosomiasis). Human infections by this parasite are common at Lake Victoria. This may increase as a result of the spread of the invasive water hyacinth (an optimum snail habitat), and the loss of many snail-eating cichlids in the lake. Fisheries Fishers and their boats on the shore of Lake Victoria Lake Victoria supports Africa's largest inland fishery (as of 1997). Initially the fishery involved native species, especially tilapia and haplochromine cichlids, but also catfish (Bagrus, Clarias, Synodontis and silver butter catfish), elephantfish, ningu (Labeo victorianus) and marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus).Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization (2016). Some of these, including tilapia and ningu (Labeo victorianus), had already declined in the first half of the 20th century due to overfishing. To boost fishing, several species of non-native tilapia and Nile perch were introduced to the lake in the 1950s. Nevertheless, the natives continued to dominate fisheries until the 1970s where their decline meant that there was a strong shift towards the non-native Nile tilapia (now 7 percent of catches), non-native Nile perch (60 percent) and the native Lake Victoria sardine (30 percent). Because of its small size, the abundant open-water Lake Victoria sardine only supported minor fisheries until the decline of other natives. At the peak in the early 1990s, of Nile perch were landed annually in Lake Victoria, but this has declined significantly in later years. Environmental issues A number of environmental issues are associated with Lake Victoria and the complete disappearance of many endemic cichlid species has been called the \\"most dramatic example of human-caused extinctions within an ecosystem\\". =Invasive fish= Starting in the 1950s, several species have been introduced to Lake Victoria where they have become invasive and a prime reason for the extinction of many endemic haplochromine cichlids. Among the introductions are several tilapias: redbreast (Coptodon rendalli), redbelly (C. zillii), Nile (Oreochromis niloticus) and blue-spotted tilapias (O. leucostictus).Pringle, R.M. (2005). The Origins of the Nile Perch in Lake Victoria. BioScience 55 (9): 780-787. Although these have contributed to the extinction of native fish by causing significant changes to the ecosystem, outcompeted natives and (in the case of the Nile tilapia) possibly hybridized with the highly threatened native tilapias, the most infamous introduction was the large and highly predatory Nile perch (Lates niloticus). The Nile perch was introduced to Lake Victoria for fishing, and can reach up to and . As early as the 1920s, it was proposed to introduce a large pelagic predator such as the Nile perch to improve the fisheries in the lake. At the same time it was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done. These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia O. esculentus, as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as \\"trash fish\\" or even vermin by the British colonial authorities. In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of doing it. The first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the British Colonial rule) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954. This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself. Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria. As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962‚Äì63. The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking. Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstantial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954‚Äì55 under the directive of senior officials. UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists. The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970. Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s. Due to the presence of the Nile perch, the natural balance of the lake's ecosystem has been disrupted. The food chain is being altered and in some cases, broken by the indiscriminate eating habits of the Nile perch. The subsequent decrease in the number of algae-eating fish allows the algae to grow at an alarming rate, thereby choking the lake. The increasing amounts of algae, in turn, increase the amount of detritus (dead plant material) that falls to the deeper portions of the lake before decomposing. As a by-product of this the oxygen levels in the deeper layer of water are being depleted. Without oxygen, any aerobic life (such as fish) cannot exist in the deeper parts of the lake, forcing all life to exist within a narrow range of depth. In this way, the Nile perch has degraded the diverse and thriving ecosystem that was once Lake Victoria. The abundance of aquatic life is not the only dependent of the lake: more than thirty million people in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda rely on the lake for its natural resources. Hundreds of endemic species that evolved under the special conditions offered by the protection of Lake Victoria have been lost due to extinction, and several more are still threatened. Their loss is devastating for the lake, the fields of ecology, genetics and evolution biology, and more evidently, for the local fisheries. Local fisheries once depended on catching the lungfish, tilapia, carp and catfish that comprise the local diet. Today, the composition and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible. Extensive fish kills, Nile perch, loss of habitat and overfishing have caused many fisheries to collapse and many protein sources to be unavailable at the market for local consumption. Few fisheries, though, have been able to make the switch to catching the Nile perch, since that requires a significant amount of capital resources. =Water hyacinth invasion= hyacinth-choked lakeshore at Ndere Island, Lake Victoria, Kenya. The water hyacinth has become a major invasive plant species in Lake Victoria. The release of large amounts of untreated wastewater (sewage) and agricultural and industrial runoff directly into Lake Victoria over the past 30 years has greatly increased the nutrient levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the lake \\"triggering massive growth of exotic water hyacinth, which colonised the lake in the late 1990s\\".Luilo, G.B. (August 01, 2008). Lake Victoria water resources management challenges and prospects: a need for equitable and sustainable institutional and regulatory frameworks African Journal of Aquatic Science 33, 2, 105‚Äì13. This invasive weed creates anoxic (total depletion of oxygen levels) conditions in the lake inhibiting decomposing plant material, raising toxicity and disease levels to both fish and people. At the same time, the plant's mat or \\"web\\" creates a barrier for boats and ferries to maneuver, impedes access to the shoreline, interferes with hydroelectric power generation, and blocks the intake of water for industries.Kateregga, E., & Sterner, T. (January 01, 2009). \\"Lake Victoria Fish Stocks and the Effects of Water Hyacinth\\". Journal of Environment & Development, 18, 1, 62‚Äì78.Mailu, A.M., G.R.S. Ochiel, W. Gitonga and S.W. Njoka. 1998. Water Hyacinth: An Environmental Disaster in the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria and its Control, pp. 101‚Äì05.Albright, T.P., Moorhouse, T.G., & McNabb, T.J. (January 1, 2004). \\"The Rise and Fall of Water Hyacinth in Lake Victoria and the Kagera River Basin, 1989-2001\\". Journal of Aquatic Plant Management, 42, 73‚Äì84. On the other hand, water hyacinth mats can potentially have a positive effect on fish life in that they create a barrier to overfishing and allow for fish growth, there has even been the reappearance of some fish species thought to have been extinct in recent years. The overall effects of the water hyacinth, however, are still unknown.J√§ger, J., Bohunovsky, L., Radosh, L., & Sustainability Project. (2008). Our planet: How much more can earth take?. London: Haus. Growth of the water hyacinth in Lake Victoria has been tracked since 1993, reaching its maxima biomass in 1997 and then declining again by the end of 2001. Greater growth was observed in the northern part of the lake, in relatively protected areas, which may be linked to current and weather patterns and could also be due to the climate and water conditions, which are more suitable to the plants growth (as there are large urban areas to the north end of the lake, in Uganda). The invasive weed was first attempted to be controlled by hand, removed manually from the lake; however, re-growth occurred quickly. Public awareness exercises were also conducted. More recently, measures have been used such as the introduction of natural insect predators, including two different water hyacinth weevils and large harvesting and chopping boats, which seem to be much more effective in eliminating the water hyacinth.Ochiel, G.S., A.M. Mailu, W. Gitonga and S.W. Njoka. 1999. Biological Control of Water Hyacinth on Lake Victoria, Kenya, pp. 115‚Äì18.Mallya, G.A. 1999. Water hyacinth control in Tanzania, pp. 25‚Äì29.United Nations Environment Programme & Belgium. (2006). Africa's lakes: Atlas of our changing environment. Nairobi, Kenya: UNEP. A green power plant that uses harvested water hyacinth (but also can use other degradable waste) was constructed in Kisumu County in 2013. In addition to the biogas it produces, its by-product can be used as fertilizer. Other factors which may have contributed to the decline of the water hyacinth in Lake Victoria include varying weather patterns, such as El Ni√±o during the last few months of 1997 and first six months of 1998 bringing with it higher levels of water in the lake and thus dislodging the plants. Heavy winds and rains along with their subsequent waves may have also damaged the plants during this same time frame. The plants may not have been destroyed, instead merely moved to another location. Additionally, the water quality, nutrient supply, temperature, and other environmental factors could have played a role. Overall, the timing of the decline could be linked to all of these factors and perhaps together, in combination, they were more effective than any one deterrent would have been by itself. The water hyacinth is in remission and this trend could be permanent if control efforts are continued.Crisman, T.L., Chapman, Lauren J., Chapman, Colin A., & Kaufman, Les S. (2003). Conservation, ecology, and management of African fresh waters. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. = Pollution = Population density around Lake Victoria Pollution of Lake Victoria is mainly due to discharge of raw sewage into the lake, dumping of domestic and industrial waste, and fertiliser and chemicals from farms. The Lake Victoria basin, while generally rural, has many major centres of population. Its shores are dotted with key cities and towns, including Kisumu, Kisii, and Homa Bay in Kenya; Kampala, Jinja and Entebbe in Uganda; and Bukoba, Mwanza, and Musoma in Tanzania. These cities and towns are also home to many factories that discharge some chemicals directly into the lake or its influent rivers. The set up of small beaches and local authorities around the lake lack proper sewage treatment facilities allowing pollutants to find their way into the water. Large parts of these urban areas also discharge untreated (raw) sewage into the river, increasing its eutrophication that in turn is helping to increase the invasive water hyacinth. Increased logging and act of deforestation has led to environmental degradation around the region reducing the absorption of polluting chemicals and deteriorating the water quality. = Environmental data = As of 2016, an environmental data repository exists for Lake Victoria. The repository contains shoreline, bathymetry, pollution, temperature, wind vector, and other important data for both the lake and the wider Basin.  History and exploration  Bismarck Rock The first recorded information about Lake Victoria comes from Arab traders plying the inland routes in search of gold, ivory, other precious commodities, and slaves. The lake as it is visible from the shores of the Speke Resort in Kampala, Uganda The lake existed and was known to many Africans in the catchment area long before it was sighted by a European in 1858 when the British explorer John Hanning Speke reached its southern shore while on his journey with Richard Francis Burton to explore central Africa and locate the Great Lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \\"vast expanse of open water\\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after Queen Victoria. Burton, who had been recovering from illness at the time and resting further south on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to have been the true source of the Nile River, which Burton regarded as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which not only sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community of the day, but also much interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery. In the late 1860s, the famous British explorer and missionary David Livingstone failed in his attempt to verify Speke's discovery, instead pushing too far west and entering the River Congo system instead. Ultimately, the Welsh-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley, on an expedition funded by the New York Herald newspaper, confirmed the truth of Speke's discovery, circumnavigating the lake and reporting the great outflow at Ripon Falls on the lake's northern shore. Nalubaale Dam The Nalubaale Hydroelectric Power Station in Njeru, Uganda. The only outflow for Lake Victoria is at Jinja, Uganda, where it forms the Victoria Nile. The water since at least 12,000 years ago drained across a natural rock weir. In 1952, engineers acting for the government of British Uganda blasted out the weir and reservoir to replace it with an artificial barrage to control the level of the lake and reduce the gradual erosion of the rock weir. A standard for mimicking the old rate of outflow called the \\"agreed curve\\" was established, setting the maximum flow rate at 300 to 1,700 cubic metres per second (392‚Äì2,224 cu yd/sec) depending on the lake's water level. In 2002, Uganda completed a second hydroelectric complex in the area, the Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station, with World Bank assistance. By 2006, the water levels in Lake Victoria had reached an 80-year low, and Daniel Kull, an independent hydrologist living in Nairobi, Kenya, calculated that Uganda was releasing about twice as much water as is allowed under the agreement, and was primarily responsible for recent drops in the lake's level.  Water use  Many towns and cities are reliant on Victoria for their water supplies, for farming and other uses. = Lamadi water scheme = The Lamadi water scheme is a water and sanitation project that serves Mwanza and the satellite towns of Lamadi, Misungwi, Magu, Bukoba, and Musoma on the bank of Lake Victoria. European Investment Bank started the project in 2013 with the aim of protecting the environmental health of the lake, through improved water and sanitation to the towns whose pollution is part of the degradation of the lake. The project aims to provide safe drinking water for an estimated one million people and improved sanitation for 100 000 people. Sediment and suspended solids are filtered out using sand, which acts like a sieve. The water is then ready to be chlorinated or treated in another way. The sand filtration helps reduce water-borne diseases and is based on the use of the local environment. Transport Since the 1900s, Lake Victoria ferries have been an important means of transport between Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. The main ports on the lake are Kisumu, Mwanza, Bukoba, Entebbe, Port Bell, and Jinja. Until 1963, the fastest and newest ferry, MV Victoria, was designated a Royal Mail Ship. In 1966, train ferry services between Kenya and Tanzania were established with the introduction of and . The ferry MV Bukoba sank in the lake on 21 May 1996 with a loss of between 800 and 1,000 lives, making it one of Africa's worst maritime disasters. Another tragedy occurred recently on 20 September 2018 that involved the passagers ferry MV Nyerere from Tanzania that caused the deaths of over 200 people.

Founded in the 7th century, it was reorganised in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries; major restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s. It is one of the largest examples of Perpendicular Gothic architecture in the West Country. The medieval abbey church served as a sometime cathedral of a bishop. After long contention between churchmen in Bath and Wells the seat of the Diocese of Bath and Wells was later consolidated at Wells Cathedral. The Benedictine community was dissolved in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The church is cruciform in plan and able to seat 1,200. An active place of worship, it also hosts civic ceremonies, concerts and lectures. There is a heritage museum in the cellars. The abbey is a Grade I listed building, particularly noted for its fan vaulting. It contains war memorials for the local population and monuments to several notable people, in the form of wall and floor plaques and commemorative stained glass. The church has two organs and a peal of ten bells. The west front includes sculptures of angels climbing to heaven on two stone ladders, representing Jacob's Ladder. History =Early history= In 675 AD, Osric, King of the Hwicce, granted the Abbess Berta 100 hides near Bath for the establishment of a convent. This religious house became a monastery under the patronage of the Bishop of Worcester. King Offa of Mercia successfully wrested \\"that most famous monastery at Bath\\" from the bishop in 781. William of Malmesbury tells that Offa rebuilt the monastic church, which may have occupied the site of an earlier pagan temple, to such a standard that King Eadwig was moved to describe it as being \\"marvellously built\\"; little is known about the architecture of this first building on the site. Monasticism in England had declined by that time, but Eadwig's brother Edgar (who was crowned \\"King of the English\\" at the abbey in 973) began its revival on his accession to the throne in 959. He encouraged monks to adopt the Rule of Saint Benedict, which was introduced at Bath under Abbot √Ülfheah (St. Alphege), who also repaired the church.Hasted, Edward. \\"The archbishops: From 988 to 1161.\\" The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 12.

British History Online website Retrieved 19 April 2020. =Norman Conquest to the Dissolution= On the west front, angels climb Jacob's Ladder Bath was ravaged in the power struggle between the sons of William the Conqueror following his death in 1087. The victor, William II Rufus, granted the city to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath. Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king, as well as the city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the city or whether he was given it as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had recently lost its abbot, √Ülfsige, and according to Domesday Book was the owner of large estates in and near the city; it was likely the abbey's wealth that attracted John to take over the monastery. By acquiring Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the city. In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey, probably in an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues. William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns. When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter, turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons at Wells who had previously served the diocese. John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath, which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray's rebellions. Permission was given to move the see of Somerset from Wells‚Äîa comparatively small settlement‚Äîto the then walled city of Bath. When this was effected in 1090, John became the first Bishop of Bath, and St Peter's was raised to cathedral status. As the roles of bishop and abbot had been combined, the monastery became a priory, run by its prior. With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status, it was felt that a larger, more up-to-date building was required. John of Tours planned a new cathedral on a grand scale, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, but only the ambulatory was complete when he died in December 1122. He was buried in the cathedral. The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was Adelard of Bath; after his various travels he was back in the monastery by 1106. The half-finished cathedral was devastated by fire in 1137, but work continued under Godfrey, the new bishop, until about 1156; the completed building was approximately long. It was consecrated while Robert of Bath was bishop. The specific date is not known; however, it was between 1148 and 1161. In 1197, Reginald Fitz Jocelin's successor, Savaric FitzGeldewin, with the approval of Pope Celestine III, officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey, but the monks there would not accept their new Bishop of Glastonbury and the title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219. Savaric's successor, Jocelin of Wells, again moved the bishop's seat to Bath Abbey, with the title Bishop of Bath. Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells. There were 40 monks on the roll in 1206. Joint cathedral status was awarded by Pope Innocent IV to Bath and Wells in 1245. Roger of Salisbury was appointed the first Bishop of Bath and Wells, having been Bishop of Bath for a year previously. Later bishops preferred Wells, the canons of which had successfully petitioned various popes down the years for Wells to regain cathedral status. Bath Cathedral gradually fell into disrepair. In 1485 the priory had 22 monks. When Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells (1495‚Äì1503), visited Bath in 1499 he was shocked to find this famous church in ruins. He also described lax discipline, idleness and a group of monks \\"all too eager to succumb to the temptations of the flesh\\". King took a year to consider what action to take, before writing to the Prior of Bath in October 1500 to explain that a large amount of the priory income would be dedicated to rebuilding the cathedral. There are several stories that, on a visit to Bath, King had a dream in which he \\"saw the Heavenly Host on high with angels ascending and descending by ladder\\" which is now represented on the west front of the cathedral. However, this interpretation, which first appeared in the writings of John Harington, around 100 years after it was supposed to have happened, has been challenged. Robert and William Vertue, the king's masons were commissioned, promising to build the finest vault in England, promising \\"there shall be none so goodely neither in England nor France\\". Their design incorporated the surviving Norman crossing wall and arches. They appointed Thomas Lynne to supervise work on site and work probably began the following spring. Oliver King planned a smaller church, covering the area of the Norman nave only. He did not live to see the result, but the restoration of the cathedral was completed just a few years before the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. =Reformation and subsequent decline= The abbey in 1875 Prior Holloway surrendered Bath Priory to the crown in January 1539. It was sold to Humphry Colles of Taunton. The abbey was stripped of its co- cathedral status in the aftermath of the Dissolution when the cathedral was consolidated in Wells. The church was stripped of lead, iron and glass and left to decay. Colles sold it to Matthew Colthurst of Wardour Castle in 1543. His son Edmund Colthurst gave the roofless remains of the building to the corporation of Bath in 1572. The corporation had difficulty finding private funds for its restoration. In 1574, Queen Elizabeth I promoted the restoration of the church, to serve as the grand parish church of Bath. She ordered that a national fund should be set up to finance the work, and in 1583 decreed that it should become the parish church of Bath. James Montague, the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608 to 1616, paid ¬£1,000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction; according to the inscription on his tomb, this was prompted after seeking shelter in the roofless nave during a thunderstorm. He is buried in an alabaster tomb in the north aisle. =Modern renaissance= Bath Abbey c. 1900 During the 1820s and 1830s buildings, including houses, shops and taverns which were very close to or actually touching the walls of the abbey were demolished and the interior remodelled by George Phillips Manners who was the Bath City Architect. Manners erected flying buttresses to the exterior of the nave and added pinnacles to the turrets. Major restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation of fan vaulting in the nave, which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design. Oliver King had arranged for the vaulting of the choir, to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to continue into the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, probably for reasons of cost. In addition a stone screen between the choir and nave was removed. Scott's work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front. Gilbert-Scott also designed the finely-carved pews in the nave, and are among the finest examples of Church seating from the period, and have been described as \\"one of the most magnificent and extensive suites of Victorian church seating in the country\\". Work carried out in the 20th and 21st centuries included full cleaning of the stonework and the reconstruction of the pipe organ by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn. The stonework of the west front had been subject to natural erosion therefore a process of lime-based conservation was carried out during the 1990s by Nimbus Conservation under the guidance of Professor Robert Baker who had previously worked on the west front of Wells Cathedral. Some of the damage to sculptures had been made worse by the use of Portland cement by previous work carried out in the Victorian era. A statue of St Phillip was beyond repair and was removed and replaced with a modern statue by Laurence Tindall. Architecture Bath Abbey, vaults The Abbey is built of Bath stone, which gives the exterior its yellow colour, and is not a typical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture; the low aisles and nave arcades and the very tall clerestory present the opposite balance to that which was usual in perpendicular churches. As this building was to serve as a monastic church, it was built to a cruciform plan, which had become relatively rare in parish churches of the time. The interior contains fine fan vaulting by Robert and William Vertue, who designed similar vaulting for the Henry VII chapel, at Westminster Abbey. The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80% of the wall space, giving the interior an impression of lightness, and reflecting the different attitudes towards churchmanship shown by the clergy of the time and those of the 12th century. The walls and roofs are supported by buttresses and surmounted by battlements, pinnacles and pierced parapets, many of which were added by George Manners during his 1830s restorations. The 16th-century West Door The nave, which has five bays, is long and wide to the pillars and rises to , with the whole church being long and wide. The west front, which was originally constructed in 1520, has a large arched window and detailed carvings. Above the window are carvings of angels and to either side long stone ladders with angels climbing up them. Apart from the story mentioned above connecting it with Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells (1495‚Äì1503), this is a direct reference to the dream of the prophet Jacob mentioned in the Bible and commonly called Jacob's Ladder. Below the window a battlemented parapet supports a statue and beneath this, on either side of the door, are statues of St Peter and St Paul. Restoration work in the late 20th century involved cleaning with electronically controlled intermittent water sprays and ammonium carbonate poultices. One of the figures which had lost its head and shoulders was replaced. The sculptures on the West front have been interpreted as representing \\"spiritual ascent through the virtue of humility and descent through the vice of pride\\" and Christ as the Man of Sorrow and the Antichrist. During the 1990s a major restoration and cleaning work were carried out on the exterior stonework, returning it to the yellow colour hidden under centuries of dirt. =Windows= The stained glass and altar at the eastern end of the nave The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80 per cent of the wall space. The east end has a square-framed window of seven lights. It includes a depiction of the nativity made by Clayton and Bell in 1872, and was presented to the church by the Bath Literary Club. The window of the Four Evangelists over the northwest door is a memorial to Charles Empson, who died in 1861. In 2010 a stained glass window was uncovered in the abbey vaults. The design around the window is by William Burges. =Tower= The two-stage central tower is not square but oblong in plan. It has two bell openings on each side and four polygonal turret pinnacles. The tower is high, and is accessed by a staircase of 212 steps. Tower as seen from Roman Baths Bells In 1700 the old ring of six bells was replaced by a new ring of eight. All but the tenor still survive. In 1770 two lighter bells were added to create the first ring of ten bells in the diocese. The tenor was recast in 1870. The abbey's tower is now home to a ring of ten bells, which are‚Äîunusually‚Äîhung so that the order of the bells from highest to lowest runs anti-clockwise around the ringing chamber. The tenor weighs 33 cwt (3,721 lb or 1,688 kg). Bath is a noted centre of change ringing in the West Country. =Interior= The interior fan vaulting ceiling, originally installed by Robert and William Vertue, was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott between 1864 and 1874. The fan vaulting provides structural stability by distributing the weight of the roof down ribs that transfer the force into the supporting columns via the flying buttresses. Gilbert Scott's work in the 1870s included the installation of large gas chandeliers made by the Coventry metalworker Francis Skidmore. They were converted to electricity in 1979. Other new features included a new pulpit and seating. A marble altarpiece from General George Wade in the sanctuary was removed and replaced with a decorative reredos. The finely-carved pews are also by Gilbert Scott, and are considered to be some of the finest examples of church seating designed by the great architect. They are unique to the abbey, and were modelled on 16th century pews found in other Somerset churches. The abbey is unique in possessing a near-complete set of Gilbert Scott furnishings. The Victorian society has emphasised the importance of Gilbert Scott's work here, stating that \\"removing them would have 'an extremely detrimental effect on the historical significance of this important religious building\\". In the 1920s Thomas Graham Jackson redesigned the Norman Chapel into a War Memorial Chapel, now Gethsemane Chapel, and added a cloister. New quire screens were installed in 2004, partly to improve the acoustics, topped with 12 carved angels playing musical instruments. A tiled floor dating from the late 13th to early 14th centuries was discovered in August 2018. Work to rebury coffins which had previously been under the abbey and stabilise the floor included the digging of a trench in which the tiles were uncovered. Monuments Senator William Bingham, who died in Bath Within the abbey are 617 wall memorials and 847 floor stones. They include those dedicated to Beau Nash, Admiral Arthur Phillip (first Governor of the colony of New South Wales, which became part of Australia after federation in 1901), James Montague (Bishop of Bath and Wells), Lady Waller (wife of William Waller, a Roundhead military leader in the English Civil War), Elizabeth Grieve (wife of James Grieve, physician to Elizabeth, Empress of Russia), Sir William Baker, John Sibthorp, Richard Hussey Bickerton, William Hoare, Richard Bickerton and US Senator William Bingham. Many of the monuments in the churchyard were carved between 1770 and 1860 by Reeves of Bath. War memorials include those commemorating the First Anglo-Afghan War (1841‚Äì42), the First World War (1914‚Äì18), and the Second World War (1939‚Äì45). The most recent memorial was installed in 1958 to commemorate Isaac Pitman, the developer of Pitman shorthand, who died in 1897. Main organ The first mention of an organ in the abbey dates to 1634, but nothing is known of that instrument. The first properly recorded organ in Bath Abbey was built by Abraham Jordan in 1708. It was modified in 1718 and 1739 by Jordan's son. The specification recorded in 1800 was one of twenty stops spread over three manuals. The compasses of the manuals were extended, one and a half octaves of pedals were added and the instrument renovated in 1802 by John Holland; further repairs were effected by Flight & Robson in 1826. This instrument was removed first to the Bishop's Palace at Wells in 1836, then to St Mary's Church, Yatton, where it was subsequently rebuilt and extensively modified. The organ in the north transept, rebuilt in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau The abbey's next organ was built in 1836 by John Smith of Bristol, to a specification of thirty stops over three manuals and pedals. This instrument was rebuilt on a new gallery in the North Transept by William Hill & Son of London in 1868, to a specification of forty stops spread over four manuals and pedals, although the Solo department, which would have brought the total to well over forty, was not completed. It was mostly removed to the Church of St Peter & St Paul, Cromer in 1896, the remainder being kept for incorporation in the new abbey organ. A new organ was supplied to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals, and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South crossing arches, with the console standing on the floor next to the north-west pier of the crossing. New cases were to be provided to designs by Brian Oliver of Bath, but were never executed. Norman & Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal. It was again rebuilt by them in 1930, and then by Hill, Norman and Beard in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58. In 1972 this was increased to a total of 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the tonal scheme's lack of coherence‚Äîthe 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972‚Äîand with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again. The organ was totally reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, retaining the existing instrument as far as was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals, and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than the sides of the case. New 75 per cent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in Saxmundham, Suffolk, was provided to allow sound egress from the bottom of the case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has tracker key action on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout. Continuo organ Bath Abbey and the Roman baths A four-stop continuo organ was built for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, contained in a case of dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three pitches: A=440 Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415 Hz and A=465 Hz. It is also possible to tune at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed. Choir The abbey has sections for boys, girls, men and children (the Melody Makers). As well as singing at the abbey, they also tour to cathedrals in the UK and Europe. The choir has broadcast Choral Evensong on BBC Radio 3, and has made several recordings. It performed at the Three Tenors concert for the opening of the Thermae Bath Spa. The abbey is also used as a venue for visiting choirs and, from its inception in 1947, the City of Bath Bach Choir. The choirs of Bath Abbey sung the 2015 Christmas Service live on BBC One. They are led by the directors of music and assisted by the organists. The current Director of Music is Huw Williams who took the role in 2017. He replaced Shean Bowers who stood in the interim after the departure of the long serving Peter King who served from 1986 to 2016. Heritage Vaults Museum The Bath Abbey Heritage Vaults Museum was located in the restored 18th-century cellars, and featured artefacts and exhibits about the abbey's history. Displays included the different buildings on the site and their uses, the abbey's impact on the community, the construction, architecture and sculptures of the buildings, artefacts and sculptures, and the role of the abbey in present times. The museum opened in 1994, but has now been closed.

It forms part of a World Heritage Site. It is the cathedral of the Archbishop of Canterbury, currently Justin Welby, leader of the Church of England and symbolic leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion. Its formal title is the Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Christ at Canterbury. Founded in 597, the cathedral was completely rebuilt between 1070 and 1077. The east end was greatly enlarged at the beginning of the 12th century and largely rebuilt in the Gothic style following a fire in 1174, with significant eastward extensions to accommodate the flow of pilgrims visiting the shrine of Thomas Becket, the archbishop who was murdered in the cathedral in 1170. The Norman nave and transepts survived until the late 14th century when they were demolished to make way for the present structures. Before the English Reformation the cathedral was part of a Benedictine monastic community known as Christ Church, Canterbury, as well as being the seat of the archbishop. History =Roman= Christianity had started to become powerful in the Roman Empire around the 3rd century. Following the conversion of Augustine of Hippo in the 4th century, the influence of Christianity grew steadily. The cathedral's first bishop was Augustine of Canterbury, previously abbot of St Andrew's Benedictine Abbey in Rome; when other dioceses were founded in England he was made archbishop. He was sent by Pope Gregory I in 596 as a missionary to the Anglo-Saxons. Augustine founded the cathedral in 597 and dedicated it to Jesus Christ, the Holy Saviour. Augustine also founded the Abbey of St Peter and Paul outside the city walls. This was later rededicated to St Augustine himself and was for many centuries the burial place of the successive archbishops. The abbey is part of the World Heritage Site of Canterbury, along with the cathedral and the ancient Church of St Martin. =Anglo-Saxon= Bede recorded that Augustine reused a former Roman church. The oldest remains found during excavations beneath the present nave in 1993 were, however, parts of the foundations of an Anglo-Saxon building, which had been constructed across a Roman road. They indicate that the original church consisted of a nave, possibly with a narthex, and side-chapels to the north and south. A smaller subsidiary building was found to the south-west of these foundations. During the 9th or 10th century this church was replaced by a larger structure () with a squared west end. It appears to have had a square central tower. The 11th-century chronicler Eadmer, who had known the Saxon cathedral as a boy, wrote that, in its arrangement, it resembled St Peter's in Rome, indicating that it was of basilican form, with an eastern apse. During the reforms of Dunstan, archbishop from 960 until his death in 988, a Benedictine abbey named Christ Church Priory was added to the cathedral. But the formal establishment as a monastery seems to date only to and the community only became fully monastic from Lanfranc's time onwards (with monastic constitutions addressed by him to Prior Henry). Dunstan was buried on the south side of the high altar. The cathedral was badly damaged during Danish raids on Canterbury in 1011. The Archbishop, √Ülfheah, was taken hostage by the raiders and eventually killed at Greenwich on 19 April 1012, the first of Canterbury's five martyred archbishops. After this a western apse was added as an oratory of Saint Mary, probably during the archbishopric of Lyfing (1013‚Äì1020) or Aethelnoth (1020‚Äì1038). The 1993 excavations revealed that the new western apse was polygonal, and flanked by hexagonal towers, forming a westwork. It housed the archbishop's throne, with the altar of St Mary just to the east. At about the same time that the westwork was built, the arcade walls were strengthened and towers added to the eastern corners of the church. =Norman= The cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1067, a year after the Norman Conquest. Rebuilding began in 1070 under the first Norman archbishop, Lanfranc (1070‚Äì1077). He cleared the ruins and reconstructed the cathedral to a design based closely on that of the Abbey of Saint-√âtienne in Caen, where he had previously been abbot, using stone brought from France. The new church, its central axis about 5m south of that of its predecessor, was a cruciform building, with an aisled nave of nine bays, a pair of towers at the west end, aisleless transepts with apsidal chapels, a low crossing tower, and a short quire ending in three apses. It was dedicated in 1077. The Norman cathedral, after its expansion by Ernulf and Conrad. Under Lanfranc's successor Anselm, who was twice exiled from England, the responsibility for the rebuilding or improvement of the cathedral's fabric was largely left in the hands of the priors. Following the election of Prior Ernulf in 1096, Lanfranc's inadequate east end was demolished, and replaced with an eastern arm 198 feet long, doubling the length of the cathedral. It was raised above a large and elaborately decorated crypt. Ernulf was succeeded in 1107 by Conrad, who completed the work by 1126. The new quire took the form of a complete church in itself, with its own transepts; the east end was semicircular in plan, with three chapels opening off an ambulatory. A free-standing campanile was built on a mound in the cathedral precinct in about 1160. As with many Gothic church buildings, the interior of the quire was richly embellished. William of Malmesbury wrote: \\"Nothing like it could be seen in England either for the light of its glass windows, the gleaming of its marble pavements, or the many- coloured paintings which led the eyes to the paneled ceiling above.\\" Though named after the 6th-century founding archbishop, the Chair of St Augustine, the ceremonial enthronement chair of the Archbishop of Canterbury, may date from the Norman period. Its first recorded use is in 1205. =Plantagenet period= Martyrdom of Thomas Becket Image of Thomas Becket from a stained glass window quire A pivotal moment in the history of the cathedral was the murder of the archbishop, Thomas Becket, in the north-west transept (also known as the Martyrdom) on Tuesday 29 December 1170, by knights of King Henry II. The king had frequent conflicts with the strong-willed Becket and is said to have exclaimed in frustration, \\"Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?\\" Four knights took it literally and murdered Becket in his own cathedral. After the Anglo-Saxon √Ülfheah, Becket was the second Archbishop of Canterbury to be murdered. The posthumous veneration of Becket transformed the cathedral into a place of pilgrimage, necessitating both expansion of the building and an increase in wealth, via revenues from pilgrims, in order to make expansion possible. Rebuilding of the quire Tomb of the Black Prince In September 1174 the quire was severely damaged by fire, necessitating a major reconstruction, the progress of which was recorded in detail by a monk named Gervase. The crypt survived the fire intact, and it was found possible to retain the outer walls of the quire, which were increased in height by in the course of the rebuilding, but with the round-headed form of their windows left unchanged. Everything else was replaced in the new Gothic style, with pointed arches, rib vaulting, and flying buttresses. The limestone used was imported from Caen in Normandy, and Purbeck marble was used for the shafting. The quire was back in use by 1180 and in that year the remains of Dunstan and √Ülfheah were moved there from the crypt. The master-mason appointed to rebuild the quire was a Frenchman, William of Sens. Following his injury in a fall from the scaffolding in 1179 he was replaced by one of his former assistants, known as \\"William the Englishman\\". Trinity Chapel and Shrine of Thomas Becket Stained glass in the Trinity Chapel Becket's crown at the far east side of the cathedral In 1180‚Äì4, in place of the old, square-ended, eastern chapel, the present Trinity Chapel was constructed, a broad extension with an ambulatory, designed to house the shrine of St Thomas Becket. A further chapel, circular in plan, was added beyond that, which housed further relics of Becket, widely believed to have included the top of his skull, struck off in the course of his assassination. This latter chapel became known as the \\"Corona\\" or \\"Becket's Crown\\". These new parts east of the quire transepts were raised on a higher crypt than Ernulf's quire, necessitating flights of steps between the two levels. Work on the chapel was completed in 1184, but Becket's remains were not moved from his tomb in the crypt until 1220. Further significant interments in the Trinity Chapel included those of Edward Plantagenet (The \\"Black Prince\\") and King Henry IV. The shrine in the Trinity Chapel was placed directly above Becket's original tomb in the crypt. A marble plinth, raised on columns, supported what an early visitor, Walter of Coventry, described as \\"a coffin wonderfully wrought of gold and silver, and marvellously adorned with precious gems\\". Other accounts make clear that the gold was laid over a wooden chest, which in turn contained an iron-bound box holding Becket's remains. Further votive treasures were added to the adornments of the chest over the years, while others were placed on pedestals or beams nearby, or attached to hanging drapery. For much of the time, the chest (or \\"feretory\\") was kept concealed by a wooden cover, which would be theatrically raised by ropes once a crowd of pilgrims had gathered. The Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus, who visited in 1512‚Äì1514, recorded that, once the cover was raised, \\"the Prior ... pointed out each jewel, telling its name in French, its value, and the name of its donor; for the principal of them were offerings sent by sovereign princes.\\" The income from pilgrims (such as those portrayed in Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales) who visited Becket's shrine, which was regarded as a place of healing, largely paid for the subsequent rebuilding of the cathedral and its associated buildings. This revenue included the profits from the sale of pilgrim badges depicting Becket, his martyrdom, or his shrine. The shrine was removed in 1538. King Henry VIII summoned the dead saint to court to face charges of treason. Having failed to appear, he was found guilty in his absence and the treasures of his shrine were confiscated, carried away in two coffers and 26 carts. Monastic buildings Cloisters A bird's-eye view of the cathedral and its monastic buildings, made in about 1165 and known as the \\"waterworks plan\\" is preserved in the Eadwine Psalter in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. It shows that Canterbury employed the same general principles of arrangement common to all Benedictine monasteries, although, unusually, the cloister and monastic buildings were to the north, rather than the south of the church. There was a separate chapter-house which still exists, said to be \\"the largest of its kind in all of England\\". Stained glass here depicts the history of Canterbury. The stained glass windows in the chapter-house The buildings formed separate groups around the church. Adjoining it, on the north side, stood the cloister and the buildings devoted to the monastic life. To the east and west of these were those devoted to the exercise of hospitality. To the north, a large open court divided the monastic buildings from menial ones, such as the stables, granaries, barn, bakehouse, brewhouse, and laundries, inhabited by the lay servants of the establishment. At the greatest possible distance from the church, beyond the precinct of the monastery, was the eleemosynary department. The almonry for the relief of the poor, with a great hall annexed, formed the paupers' hospitium. Perpendicular vaulting in the nave and transepts The group of buildings devoted to monastic life included two cloisters. The great cloister was surrounded by the buildings essentially connected with the daily life of the monks: the church to the south, with the refectory placed as always on the side opposite, the dormitory, raised on a vaulted undercroft, and the chapter-house adjacent, and the lodgings of the cellarer, responsible for providing both monks and guests with food, to the west. A passage under the dormitory led eastwards to the smaller or infirmary cloister, appropriated to sick and infirm monks. The hall and chapel of the infirmary extended east of this cloister, resembling in form and arrangement the nave and chancel of an aisled church. Beneath the dormitory, overlooking the green court or herbarium, lay the \\"pisalis\\" or \\"calefactory\\", the common room of the monks. At its northeast corner access was given from the dormitory to the necessarium, a building in the form of a Norman hall, long by broad, containing 55 seats. It was constructed with careful regard to hygiene, with a stream of water running through it from end to end. A second smaller dormitory for the conventual officers ran from east to west. Close to the refectory, but outside the cloisters, were the domestic offices connected with it: to the north, the kitchen, square, with a pyramidal roof, and the kitchen court; to the west, the butteries, pantries, etc. The infirmary had a small kitchen of its own. Opposite the refectory door in the cloister were two lavatories, where the monks washed before and after eating. View from the northwest circa 1890‚Äì1900. The buildings devoted to hospitality were divided into three groups. The prior's group were \\"entered at the south-east angle of the green court, placed near the most sacred part of the cathedral, as befitting the distinguished ecclesiastics or nobility who were assigned to him.\\" The cellarer's buildings, where middle-class visitors were entertained, stood near the west end of the nave. The inferior pilgrims and paupers were relegated to the north hall or almonry, just within the gate. Priors of Christ Church Priory included John of Sittingbourne (elected 1222, previously a monk of the priory) and William Chillenden, (elected 1264, previously monk and treasurer of the priory).Priors of Canterbury , Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (northern and southern provinces; 1971), pp. 8‚Äì12 The monastery was granted the right to elect their own prior if the seat was vacant by the pope, and ‚Äì from Gregory IX onwards ‚Äì the right to a free election (though with the archbishop overseeing their choice). Monks of the priory have included √Üthelric I, √Üthelric II, Walter d'Eynsham, Reginald fitz Jocelin (admitted as a confrater shortly before his death), Nigel de Longchamps and Ernulf. The monks often put forward candidates for Archbishop of Canterbury, either from among their number or outside, since the archbishop was nominally their abbot, but this could lead to clashes with the king or pope should they put forward a different man ‚Äì examples are the elections of Baldwin of Forde and Thomas Cobham. Quire screen 14th and 15th centuries Early in the 14th century, Prior Eastry erected a stone quire screen and rebuilt the chapter house, and his successor, Prior Oxenden inserted a large five-light window into St Anselm's chapel. The cathedral was seriously damaged by an earthquake of 1382, losing its bells and campanile. From the late 14th century the nave and transepts were rebuilt, on the Norman foundations in the Perpendicular style under the direction of the noted master mason Henry Yevele. In contrast to the contemporary rebuilding of the nave at Winchester, where much of the existing fabric was retained and remodeled, the piers were entirely removed, and replaced with less bulky Gothic ones, and the old aisle walls were completely taken down except for a low \\"plinth\\" left on the south side. More Norman fabric was retained in the transepts, especially in the east walls, and the old apsidal chapels were not replaced until the mid-15th century. The arches of the new nave arcade were exceptionally high in proportion to the clerestory. The new transepts, aisles, and nave were roofed with lierne vaults, enriched with bosses. Most of the work was done during the priorate of Thomas Chillenden (1391‚Äì1411): Chillenden also built a new quire screen at the east end of the nave, into which Eastry's existing screen was incorporated. The Norman stone floor of the nave, however, survived until its replacement in 1786. Perpendicular style nave Canterbury Cathedral, fan vaulting of the crossing From 1396 the cloisters were repaired and remodeled by Yevele's pupil Stephen Lote who added the lierne vaulting. It was during this period that the wagon-vaulting of the chapter house was created. A shortage of money and the priority given to the rebuilding of the cloisters and chapterhouse meant that the rebuilding of the west towers was neglected. The south-west tower was not replaced until 1458, and the Norman north-west tower survived until 1834 when it was replaced by a replica of its Perpendicular companion. In about 1430 the south transept apse was removed to make way for a chapel, founded by Lady Margaret Holland and dedicated to St Michael and All Angels. The north transept apse was replaced by a Lady Chapel, built-in 1448‚Äì1455. The crossing tower was begun in 1433, although preparations had already been made during Chillenden's priorate when the piers had been reinforced. Further strengthening was found necessary around the beginning of the 16th century when buttressing arches were added under the southern and western tower arches. The tower is often known as the \\"Angel Steeple\\", after a gilded angel that once stood on one of its pinnacles. =Modern period= The decorative font in the nave The Reformation, Dissolution and Puritanism The cathedral ceased to be an abbey during the Dissolution of the Monasteries when all religious houses were suppressed. Canterbury surrendered in March 1539, and reverted to its previous status of 'a college of secular canons'. According to the cathedral's own website, it had been a Benedictine monastery since the 900s. The New Foundation came into being on 8 April 1541.Barrie Dobson, \\"Canterbury in the Later Middle Ages, 1220‚Äì1540\\", in A History of Canterbury Cathedral, OUP 1995, p. 153. The shrine to St Thomas Becket was destroyed on the orders of Henry VIII and the relics lost. In 1642‚Äì1643, during the English Civil War, Puritan iconoclasts caused significant damage during their \\"cleansing\\" of the cathedral. Included in that campaign was the destruction of the statue of Christ in the Christ Church Gate and the demolition of the wooden gates by a group led by Richard Culmer. The statue would not be replaced until 1990 but the gates were restored in 1660 and a great deal of other repair work started at that time; that would continue until 1704. Furnishings In 1688, the joiner Roger Davis, citizen of London, removed the 13th century misericords and replaced them with two rows of his own work on each side of the quire. Some of Davis's misericords have a distinctly medieval flavour and he may have copied some of the original designs. When Sir George Gilbert Scott carried out renovations in the 19th century, he replaced the front row of Davis' misericords, with new ones of his own design, which seem to include many copies of those at Gloucester Cathedral, Worcester Cathedral and New College, Oxford. Norman north west tower prior to rebuilding, (coloured engraving) Statues on the West Front Most of the statues that currently adorn the west front of the cathedral were installed in the 1860s when the South Porch was being renovated. At that time, the niches were vacant and the Dean of the cathedral thought that the appearance of the cathedral would be improved if they were filled. The Victorian sculptor Theodore Pfyffers was commissioned to create the statues and most of them were installed by the end of the 1860s. There are currently 53 statues representing various figures who have been influential in the life of the cathedral and the English church such as clergy, members of the royal family, saints, and theologians. Archbishops of Canterbury from Augustine of Canterbury and Lanfranc, to Thomas Cranmer and William Laud are represented. Kings and Queens from √Üthelberht and Bertha of Kent, to Victoria and Elizabeth II are included. 18th century to the present The Christchurch Gate with the new (1990) statue of Christ; the original was destroyed in 1643 The original towers of Christ Church Gate were removed in 1803 and were replaced in 1937. The statue of Christ was replaced in 1990 with a bronze sculpture of Christ by Klaus Ringwald. The original Norman northwest tower, which had a lead spire until 1705, was demolished in 1834 owing to structural concerns. It was replaced with a Perpendicular-style twin of the southwest tower (designed by Thomas Mapilton), now known as the \\"Arundel Tower\\", providing a more symmetrical appearance for the cathedral. This was the last major structural alteration to the cathedral to be made. In 1866, there were six residentiary canonries, of which one was annexed to the Archdeaconry of Canterbury and another to that of Maidstone.The Clergy List for 1866 (London: George Cox, 1866) p. 261 In September 1872, a large portion of the Trinity Chapel roof was completely destroyed by fire. There was no significant damage to the stonework or interior and the damage was quickly repaired. The cathedral did not sustain serious damage during either World War During the bombing raids of the Second World War its library was destroyed, but the cathedral did not sustain extensive bomb damage; the local Fire Wardens doused any flames on the wooden roof. In 1986, a new Martyrdom Altar was installed in the northwest transept, on the spot where Thomas Becket was slain, the first new altar in the cathedral for 448 years. Mounted on the wall above it, there is a metal sculpture by Truro sculptor Giles Blomfield depicting a cross flanked by two bloodstained swords which, together with the shadows they cast, represent the four knights who killed Becket. A stone plaque also commemorates Pope John Paul II's visit to the United Kingdom in 1982. In 2015, Sarah Mullally and Rachel Treweek became the first women to be ordained as bishops in the cathedral, as Bishop of Crediton and Bishop of Gloucester respectively.First female diocesan bishop in C of E consecrated . Anglicannews.org. Retrieved on 23 July 2015. The cathedral is the Regimental Church of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment. The cathedral is also used as one of the venues for the graduation ceremonies of the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University. Conservation Much of the stonework at Canterbury Cathedral is damaged and crumbling, the roofs are leaking and much of the stained glass is badly corroded. The last quinquennial structural review revealed that a combination of centuries of weathering, pollution and constant use had taken its toll on the ancient building and some serious problems were in need of urgent action. The single biggest challenge is the roof. The cathedral is covered by a huge expanse of lead and whilst the majority of the wooden framework remains sound, much of the lead itself needs replacing. In addition, a large amount of concrete encasing the bottom of the roof beams needs to be removed and replaced with traditional wooden footers. Conservation of the external masonry, particularly on the northern side of the building, is equally important. The cathedral is in part built of Caen stone. Detailed archaeological studies are undertaken to identify exactly which stones need to be replaced or repaired. In addition, specialist cleaning techniques are used to remove accumulated chemical deposits which are very damaging to the building. As regards the interior, priorities include decoration of the vaults of the Trinity Chapel, major improvements to the Treasury building which contains, amongst other things, the choir practice rooms, and conservation work in several other chapels. One of the many stained-glass windows at Canterbury Cathedral The earliest coloured glass windows in the cathedral date from the late 12th century, whilst others are as new as the four Ervin Boss√°nyi windows in the south-east transept (1957). Many have already been conserved and protected by the team of stained glass conservators led by Leonie Seliger. However, much conservation work remains to be done, notably on the Oculus window in the south-east transept ‚Äì a late 12th-century round window. During the autumn of 2008, a major restoration of the lead roof over the transept was completed at a cost of approximately ¬£500,000. In 2018, the lead roof of the nave was replaced. The extensive restoration of the cathedral that was underway in mid-2018 was part of a 2016-2021 schedule that also includes improved landscaping and accessibility, new visitor facilities and a general external restoration. The so-called Canterbury Journey project was expected to cost nearly ¬£25 million; the funding included a ¬£13.8 million Heritage Lottery grant, ¬£10.9 million from by the Canterbury Cathedral Trust and ¬£250,000 from the Friends of the Cathedral. Foundation The Foundation is the authorised staffing establishment of the cathedral, few of whom are clergy. The head of the cathedral is the Dean, currently Robert Willis, who is assisted by a chapter of 30 canons, four of whom are residentiary, the others being honorary appointments of senior clergy in the diocese. There are also a number of lay canons who all together form the greater chapter which has the legal responsibility both for the cathedral itself and also for the formal election of an archbishop when there is a vacancy-in-see. By English law and custom, they may only elect the person who has been nominated by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister. The Foundation also includes the choristers, lay clerks, organists, King's Scholars, the Six Preachers and a range of other officers; some of these posts are moribund, such as that of the cathedral barber. The cathedral has a workforce of over 300 (many of whom work part-time), and approximately 800 volunteers. =Dean and Chapter= As of 2 October 2020: *Dean ‚Äî Robert Willis (since 1 July 2001) *Archdeacon of Canterbury and Canon Residentiary ‚Äî Jo Kelly-Moore (Archdeacon and Canon since 22 January 2017 collation) *Canon Librarian ‚Äî Tim Naish (since 22 April 2018) *Canon Missioner ‚Äî Emma Pennington (since 16 March 2019) *Canon Treasurer (Diocesan Canon) ‚Äî Andrew Dodd (since 27 September 2020 installation) & The Cathedral uses \\"Vice Dean\\" not of one particular appointee, but to refer to the Canon in Residence for each month. Minor canons: *Precentor ‚Äî Max Kramer (since 10 June 2017)Canterbury Cathedral ‚Äî Senior Positions (Accessed 5 January 2018) =Finance= Canterbury Cathedral receives no government or state funding and only occasional grants from English Heritage. It is not funded by the Church of England. The Church Commissioners pay the salary of the dean and two of the residentiary canons only. The cathedral is therefore largely self-funded. Around ¬£18,000 is spent each day (2017) on running costs. In order to meet these costs the cathedral has to rely on income from entry fees paid by visitors and a number of commercial operations such as property rental, the Cathedral Shop, as well as the Cathedral Lodge Hotel and Conference Centre. Appeal The \\"Save Canterbury Cathedral\\" appeal was launched in October 2006 to protect and enhance the cathedral's future as a centre of worship, heritage and culture. The aim was to raise ¬£50 million; by the end of 2010 the appeal had raised ¬£11.5 million, and as at May 2014 over ¬£20 million had been raised. The core part of the fundraising programme is focused on the cathedral's fabric. The major conservation-restoration projects already identified will cost ¬£30 million. Fabric conservation is the most urgent element of the campaign. The appeal ‚Äì the third of its kind following major fundraising drives at Canterbury in the 1950s and 1970s ‚Äì was launched to fund these projects. Fundraising for the appeal will take place over a number of years both nationally and internationally, stressing the cathedral's role as the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion and as a World Heritage Site. An integrated conservation programme that addresses the priority areas has been drawn up by the cathedral's Surveyor to the Fabric, John Burton. Major repair and conservation projects to be funded by the appeal include roofs of the nave, aisles, and North West and South East Transepts; stone carvings, pinnacles and stone facings of the Bell Harry Tower; work on the North side of the Corona Chapel; conservation of the Christ Church Gate entry to the Precincts; conservation of stained glass and surrounding stonework throughout the cathedral; and preservation of the collection of historic books and manuscripts. In addition, there are plans to refurbish the cathedral pipe organ and renovations to the Choir House have already been completed, providing better facilities for choristers. Improvements are planned to the fabric of the library buildings and to the cathedral's audio-visual and lighting systems which will significantly benefit visitors including the disabled, visually impaired and hard of hearing. The appeal also aims to develop the outmoded workshop area and stained glass studio, in order to ensure the survival of Canterbury as a centre of excellence for vital craft skills and to promote a sustainable maintenance base for work on the cathedral which can be viewed by the public. The fundraising group is the Canterbury Cathedral Trust, an independent, registered charity (1112590) seeking funds to provide conservation, craftsmanship, music and education. Since mid-2017, the Chief Executive has been Sarah Frankland. The Trust was able to obtain the ¬£24.7m needed for The Canterbury Journey multi-year restoration programme which should be completed in 2021. In 2016/17 the Trust received ¬£3.66m in donations and an additional ¬£1.61m had been pledged for future projects. The next plan was to raise funds to restore and improve the Quire organ by 2020. In 2017, the cathedral was planning to have the new Welcome Centre open in 2019, with exhibition spaces and viewing gallery. Music =Organ= The organ at Canterbury is of four manuals and is in both south and the north quire aisles, as well as a nave division. It was built in 1886 by Henry Willis and subsequently rebuilt by the same firm in the mid-20th century. It was rebuilt by N. P. Mander in 1978 and reduced to three manuals at about that time. The organ has now been fully restored and greatly enlarged, including reinstating the fourth manual, by Harrison and Harrison with work finishing in February 2020. https://www.npor.org.uk/NPORView.html?RI=K01569 =Organists= Organists and assistant organists at Canterbury Cathedral have included composers Clement Charlton Palmer, Gerald Hocken Knight and Philip Moore and musical directors Allan Wicks and Stephen Darlington. The current organist and master of the choristers is David Flood and his assistant organist, who is also director of the girls' choir, is David Newsholme. In September 2015, Adrian Bawtree was appointed second assistant organist, a position that replaced the organ scholarship. =Choirs= There has been a choral tradition at Canterbury Cathedral for 1400 years. The cathedral choir consists of 25 boy choristers and 12 lay clerks. The boys are aged eight to thirteen. They receive scholarships and attend St Edmund's School, Canterbury.Canterbury Cathedral Choir , retrieved 1 March 2013. There are seven choral services a week with Choral Evensong at 5:30 pm on Monday-Friday, with the boys alone on Thursday and men on Wednesday. On Saturday and Sunday, there is evensong at 3:15 pm and Eucharist on Sunday at 11 am. There are numerous extra services, especially at Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost. The Girls' Choir of Canterbury Cathedral was founded in 2014 and their first performance at Evensong, in January, was attended by more than 600 people and widely covered by the international press. They gave their first concert in December of that year. They typically perform at Evensong twice every month, often with the lay clerks of the cathedral choir. The girls are aged 12 to 18. They attend local schools in Canterbury and some further afield.Canterbury Cathedral Girls' Choir , retrieved 9 December 2014 Bells Great Dunstan. The cathedral has a total of 21 bells in the three towers: The South West Tower (Oxford Tower) contains the cathedral's main ring of bells, hung for change ringing in the English style. There are fourteen bells ‚Äì a ring of twelve with two semitones, which allow for ringing on ten, eight or six bells while still remaining in tune. All of the bells were cast in 1981 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry from seven bells of the old peal of twelve with new metal added and rehung in a new frame. The length (draught) of the ropes was increased by lowering the floor of the ringing chamber to the level of the south aisle vault at the same time, also allowing for the new bells to be set lower in the belfry than the old, with the intention of reducing stress on the Medieval structure. The heaviest bell (tenor) of this ring weighs . The ringers practise on Thursday at 7:15 pm. The North West Tower (Arundel Tower) contains the cathedral's clock chime. The five-quarter chimes were taken from the old peal of twelve in the Oxford Tower (where the clock was originally), and hung from beams in the Arundel Tower. The chimes are struck on the eighth Gregorian tone, which is also used at Merton College, Oxford. The hour is struck on Great Dunstan, the largest bell in Kent at , which is also swung on Sunday mornings for Matins. In 1316 Prior Henry of Eastry gave a large bell dedicated to Saint Thomas, which weighed . Later, in 1343, Prior Hathbrand gave bells dedicated to Jesus and St Dunstan. At this time the bells in campanile were rehung and their names recorded as \\"Jesus\\", \\"Dunstan\\", \\"Mary\\", \\"Crundale\\", \\"Elphy\\" (√Ülfheah) and \\"Thomas\\". In the great earthquake of 1382 the campanile fell, destroying the first three named bells. Following its reconstruction, the other three bells were rehung, together with two others, of whose casting no record remains. The oldest bell in the cathedral is Bell Harry (approximately ), which hangs in a cage on the top of the central tower to which the bell lends its name. This bell was cast by Joseph Hatch in 1635, and is struck at 8 am and 9 pm every day to announce the opening and closing of the cathedral, and also occasionally for services as a Sanctus bell. The cathedral also has custody of the bell of HMS Canterbury, a World War I-era light cruiser, hung near the Buffs Chapel in the southwest transept. Library The cathedral library has a collection of about 30,000 books and pamphlets printed before the 20th century and about 20,000 later books and serials. Many of the earlier books were acquired as part of donated collections. It is rich in church history, older theology, British history (including local history), travel, science and medicine, and the anti-slavery movement. The library's holdings are included in the online catalogue of the library of the University of Kent. two leaves from the Lyghfield Bible In July 2018, the cathedral purchased at auction a medieval Trussel Bible for ¬£100,000. This bible, subsequently renamed the \\"Lyghfield Bible\\", after the monk William Lighfyld, had previously been at Canterbury, being removed following the Dissolution.

Saxo Grammaticus (c. 1160 ‚Äì c. 1220), also known as Saxo cognomine Longus, was a Danish historian, theologian and author. He is thought to have been a clerk or secretary to Absalon, Archbishop of Lund, the main advisor to Valdemar I of Denmark. He is the author of the Gesta Danorum, the first full history of Denmark, from which the legend of Amleth would come to inspire the story of Hamlet by Shakespeare.  Life  The Jutland Chronicle gives evidence that Saxo was born in Zealand (). It is unlikely he was born before 1150 and it is supposed that his death could have occurred around 1220. His name Saxo was a common name in medieval Denmark. The name Grammaticus (\\"the learned\\") was first given to him in the Jutland Chronicle and the Sj√¶lland Chronicle makes reference to Saxo cognomine Longus (\\"with the byname 'the tall'\\"). He lived in a period of warfare and Danish expansion, led by Archbishop Absalon and the Valdemars. The Danes were also being threatened by the Wends who were making raids across the border and by sea. Valdemar I had also just won a civil war and later Valdemar II led an expedition across the Elbe to invade Holstein. Sven Aggesen, a Danish nobleman and author of a slightly earlier history of Denmark than Saxo's, describes his contemporary, Saxo, as his contubernalis, meaning tent-comrade. This gives evidence that Saxo and Sven might have soldiered in the Hird or royal guard since Sven used the word contubernium in reference to them. There is also a Saxo to be found on a list of clergy at Lund, where there was a Sven recorded as Archdeacon. Likewise there is Dean Saxo who died in 1190; however the date does not match what is known about Saxo. Both arguments, for a secular or religious Saxo, would confirm that he was well educated, as clergy he would have received training in Latin and sons of great men were often sent to Paris. Saxo comes from a warrior family and writes that he is himself committed to being a soldier. He tells us that he follows \\"the ancient right of hereditary service,\\" and that his father and grandfather \\"were recognized frequenters of your renowned sire's (Valdemar I) war camp.\\" Saxo's education and ability support the idea that he was educated outside Denmark. Some suggest the title \\"Grammaticus\\" refers not to his education but rather his elaborate Latin style. We know from his writing that he was in the retinue and received the patronage of Absalon, Archbishop of Lund, who was the foremost adviser to King Valdemar I. In his will Absalon forgives his clerk Saxo a small debt of two and a half marks of silver and tells him to return two borrowed books to the monastery of Sor√∏. The legacy of Saxo Grammaticus is the sixteen-book heroic history of the Danes called Gesta Danorum.  Gesta Danorum  In the preface to the work, Saxo writes that his patron Absalon (c. 1128 ‚Äì 21 March 1201), Archbishop of Lund had encouraged him to write a heroic history of the Danes. The history is thought to have been started about 1185, after Sven Aggesen wrote his history. The goal of Gesta Danorum was as Saxo writes \\"to glorify our fatherland,\\" which he accomplishes on the model of the Aeneid by Vergil. Saxo also may have owed much to Plato, Cicero and also to more contemporary writers like Geoffrey of Monmouth. Saxo's history of the Danes was compiled from sources that are of questionable historical value but were to him the only ones extant. He drew on oral tales of the Icelanders, ancient volumes, letters carved on rocks and stone, and the statements of his patron Absalon concerning the history of which the Archbishop had been a part. Saxo's work was not strictly a history or a simple record of old tales, rather it was, in the parlance of Friis-Jensen, \\"a product of Saxo's own mind and times,\\"; Westergaard writes that Saxo combines the history and mythology of the heroic age of Denmark and reworks it into his own story that exemplifies the past of the Danes. The history is composed of sixteen books and extends from the time of the founders of the Danish people, Dan I of Denmark and Angul into about the year 1187. The first four are concerned with the history of the Danes before Christ, the next four with the history after Christ, books 9‚Äì12 Christian Denmark and 13‚Äì16 promote Lund and the exploits early before and during Saxo's own lifetime. It is assumed that the last eight books were written first, as Saxo drew heavily on the work of Absalon (who died in 1201, before the work was completed) for evidence of the age of Saint Canute and Valdemar I. The first eight volumes share a likeness with the works of Saxo's contemporary Snorri Sturluson. They deal with mythical elements such as giants and the Scandinavian pantheon of gods. Saxo tells of Dan the first king of Denmark who had a brother named Angul who gave his name to the Angles. He also tells the stories of various other Danish heroes, many who interact with the Scandinavian gods. Saxo's \\"heathen\\" gods however were not always good characters. They were sometimes treacherous such as in the story of Harald, legendary king of the Danes, who was taught the ways of warfare by Odin and then was betrayed and killed by the god who then brought him to Valhalla. Saxo's world is seen to have had very warlike values. He glorifies the heroes that made their names in battle far more than those who made peace. His view of the period of peace under King Frode was very low and was only satisfied when King Knut brought back the ancestral customs. Saxo's chronology of kings extends up to Saint Canute and his son Valdemar I. Saxo finished the history with the Preface, which he wrote last, in c. 1216 under the patronage of Anders Sunesen who replaced Absalon as Archbishop of Lund. Saxo included in the preface warm appreciation of both Archbishops and of the reigning King Valdemar II.  Historical contribution  Of particular interest for Shakespeare scholars is the story of Amleth, the first instance of the playwright's Hamlet. Saxo based the story on an oral tale of a son taking revenge for his murdered father. Christiern Pedersen, a Canon of Lund, collaborated with Jodocus Badius Ascensius, a fellow enthusiast, to print the work of Saxo Grammaticus early in the sixteenth century. This was the first major step toward securing the historical significance of Gesta Danorum. Starting from that point, the knowledge of it began to spread within the academic community. Oliver Elton, who was the first to translate the first nine books of Gesta Danorum into English, wrote that Saxo was the first writer produced by Denmark. Saxo's skill as a Latinist was praised by Erasmus, who wondered how \\"a Dane of that age got so great power of eloquence\\". Later R. W. Chambers would call Saxo's writings \\"difficult and bombastic, but always amusing Latin\\".Quoted in C. Tolkien ed, J. R. R. Tolkien: Beowulf (2015), p.154 There have been many attempts to understand the type of Latin language used by Saxo, and to juxtapose it in history, to provide more information on where he was educated. Some have considered his Latin to have more in common with legal than ecclesiastical training, and his poetry is thought to have traces of parallelism. Although Saxo is commonly viewed by modern Danes as their \\"first national historian\\", two other coherent accounts of Danish history by Danish authors predate Gesta Danorum. They are Chronicon Roskildense (English: Roskilde Chronicle), a small work written in Latin, completed in c. 1143, spanning from the introduction of Christianity in Denmark to the author's own time. The next to be published was Brevis historia regum Dacie, written by Sven Aggesen (b. c. 1140‚Äì1150 ‚Äì death unknown), thought to have been finished in 1186 or 1187 (the last event described happened in 1185), covering the years 300‚Äì1185.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 1.Inge Skovgaard-Petersen, in Knut Helle, ed. The Cambridge History of Scandinavia, vol. I, p. 355. Saxo's works were received enthusiastically by the Renaissance era scholars, who were curious about the pre-Christian history and legends. Saxo's portrayals of history have been seen to differ greatly from those of his contemporaries, especially Norwegian and Icelandic, including portrayals of various historical characters as either heroes or villains. There are also differences between Saxo's work and that of the fellow Danish historian Sven Aggesen from the same era. These differences have to do with Saxo's elaboration and euhemerism in his descriptions of mainly Scandinavian history and mythology, Saxo's account on the tale of Thyri, for instance, is considered to be far more fantastic than the same tale presented by Sven. Saxo's work has been criticized for this reason. Kurt Johannesson's studies expanded greatly on the comprehension of Gesta Danorum, deviating from the approach that focuses mostly in mythology, and allowing the development of a wider understanding of Saxo's works. Recently some scholars, such as Sigurd Kv√¶rndrup, inspired by Johannesson's study of the four Cardinal Virtues in Gesta Danorum, have studied other elaborations and schemes in the writings of Saxo. Some of them have concluded that Saxo, instead of simply distorting alleged true Nordic and Baltic traditions and/or beliefs, was creating something new, attuned to the approaching 13th century Danish race to strengthen institutions and engage in the Northern Crusades. Importantly, after the death in 1202 of his patron Absalon, Saxo Grammaticus appears to have changed his agenda. What eventually came to be the first nine books of Gesta Danorum, were actually written after the death of Absalon, and they focus largely on mythology, for which Saxo has been criticized for. The contrast to the seven books written during the lifetime of Absalon is \\"enormous\\", leading the main core of scholars to divide the two parts into mythical (books I‚ÄìIX) and historical (books X‚ÄìXVI), the last of the historical books being based on Absalon's memories. Therefore, we prefer to support the composition order of Gesta Danorum as X‚ÄìXVI, followed by I‚ÄìIX, and ending with the preface, says historian Andr√© Muceniecks from the Department of History at University of S√£o Paulo in Brazil.\\"The ‚ÄòThematic of the Counselor‚Äô in the Gesta Danorum and the Strengthening of the danish Hegemony in the medieval Baltic Area.\\" An abstract of a study by Andr√© Muceniecks.

It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time. It was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti- art expressions of masculine anger, energy, and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics with \\"confrontational, politically- charged lyrics.\\"Campbell, Michael. Popular Music in America: The Beat Goes On. Nelson Education, 2012. p. 360 Hardcore sprouted underground scenes across the United States in the early 1980s, particularly in Washington, D.C., New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Boston‚Äîas well as in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Hardcore has spawned the straight edge movement and its associated submovements, hardline and youth crew. Hardcore was heavily involved in the rise of the independent record labels in the 1980s and with the DIY ethics in underground music scenes. It has also influenced various music genres that have experienced widespread commercial success, including alternative rock and thrash metal. While traditional hardcore has never experienced mainstream commercial success, some of its early pioneers have garnered appreciation over time. Black Flag's Damaged, Minutemen's Double Nickels on the Dime and H√ºsker D√º's New Day Rising were included in Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003 and Dead Kennedys have seen one of their albums reach gold status over a period of 25 years. In 2011, Rolling Stone writer David Fricke placed Greg Ginn of Black Flag 99th place in his 100 Greatest Guitarists list. Although the music genre started in English-speaking western countries, notable hardcore scenes have existed in Italy and Japan.

An article in Drowned in Sound argues that 1980s-era \\"hardcore is the true spirit of punk\\", because \\"after all the poseurs and fashionistas fucked off to the next trend of skinny pink ties with New Romantic haircuts, singing wimpy lyrics\\", the punk scene consisted only of people \\"completely dedicated to the DIY ethics\\". Like the Oi! subgenre of the UK, hardcore punk can be considered an internal music reaction. Hardcore has been called a \\"...faster, meaner genre\\" of punk that was also a \\"stern refutation\\" of punk rock; a \\"rebellion against a rebellion\\". Blush states that even though punk rock had an \\"unruly edge\\", \\"Reagan-era kids demanded something even more primal and immediate, with speed and aggression as the starting point.\\" According to one writer, \\"distressed by the 'art'ificiality of much post-punk and the emasculated sellouts of new wave, hardcore sought to strengthen its core punk principles.\\" Lacking the art-school grace of post-punk, hardcore punk \\"favor[ed] low key visual aesthetic over extravagance and breaking with original punk rock song patterns.\\" Hardcore \\"disavows ‚Ä¶ synthetic technological effects [and] the recording industry.\\"Malory, Curry and Pena, Milagros.

Music writer Barney Hoskyns compared punk rock with hardcore and stated that hardcore was \\"younger, faster and angrier, full of the pent up rage of dysfunctional Orange County adolescents\\" who were sick of their life in a \\"bland Republican\\" area.

Steven Blush states that Minor Threat's Ian MacKaye \\"set in motion a die-hard mindset that begat almost everything we now call Hardcore\\" with his \\"virulent anti-[music] industry, anti-star, pro- scene exhortations.\\" One of the important philosophies in the hardcore scene is authenticity. The pejorative term \\"poseur\\" is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values and philosophy. Joe Keithley, the vocalist of D.O.A., said in an interview: \\"For every person sporting an anarchy symbol without understanding it there's an older punk who thinks they're a poseur.\\" =Musical elements= In the vein of earlier punk rock, most hardcore punk bands have followed the traditional singer/guitar/bass/drum format. The songwriting has more emphasis on rhythm rather than melody. Blush writes \\"The Sex Pistols were still rock'n'roll...like the craziest version of Chuck Berry. Hardcore was a radical departure from that. It wasn't verse- chorus rock. It dispelled any notion of what songwriting is supposed to be. It's its own form.\\" According to AllMusic, the overall blueprint for hardcore was playing louder, harder and faster.

Noisey magazine describes one hardcore band as \\"an all- encompassing, full-volume assault\\" in which \\"[e]very instrument sounds like it's competing for the most power and highest volume.\\" Scott Wilson states that the hardcore of the Bad Brains emphasized two elements: \\"off-the-charts\\" loudness which reached a level of threatening, powerful \\"uncompromising noise\\" and rhythm, in place of the typically focused-on elements in mainstream rock music, harmony and pitch (i.e., melody).Wilson, Scott A. Music at the Extremes: Essays on Sounds Outside the Mainstream. McFarland, 2015. p. 40 Hardcore vocalists often shout, scream or chant along with the music, using \\"vocal intensity\\" and an abrasive tone. The shouting of hardcore vocalists is often accompanied by audience members who are singing along, making the hardcore vocalist like the \\"leader of a mob\\".

Hardcore lyrics expressed the \\"frustration and political disillusionment\\" of youth who were against 1980s-era affluence, consumerism, greed, Reagan politics and authority. The polarizing socio-political messages in hardcore lyrics (and outrageous on-stage behaviour) meant that the genre garnered no mainstream popularity. In hardcore, guitarists frequently play fast power chords with a heavily distorted and amplified tone, creating what has been called a \\"buzzsaw\\" sound.Steven Blush. American Hardcore: A Tribal Tradition. Feral House, 2001. p. 151 Guitar parts can sometimes be complex, technically versatile, and rhythmically challenging. Hardcore guitarists use some approaches that are similar to their thrash counterparts: \\"...very high output pickups\\", \\"lots of upper midrange\\", \\"a full, bass-heavy\\" tone and the use of both guitar amp distortion and a \\"Tube Screamer or similar overdrive pedal\\", but without speaker distortion. Guitar melody lines usually use the same minor scales used by vocalists (although some solos use pentatonic scales). Hardcore guitarists sometimes play solos, octave leads and grooves, as well as tapping into the various feedback and harmonic noises available to them. There are generally fewer guitar solos in hardcore than in mainstream rock, because solos were viewed as representing the \\"excess and superficiality\\" of mainstream commercial rock. Hardcore bassists use varied rhythms in their basslines, ranging from longer held notes (whole notes and half notes) to quarter notes, to rapid eighth note or sixteenth note runs. To play rapid bass lines that would be hard to play with the fingers, some bassists use a pick. Some bassists play fuzz bass by overdriving their bass tone. Hardcore drumming, with the drummer hitting them aggressively, has been called the \\"engine\\" and most essential element of the genre's aggressive sound of \\"unrelenting anger\\". Two other key elements for hardcore drummers are playing \\"tight\\" with the other musicians, especially the bassist (this does not mean metronomic time; indeed coordinated tempo shifts are used in many important hardcore albums) and the drummer should have listened to a lot of hardcore, so that she or he can understand the \\"raw emotions\\" it expresses. Lucky Lehrer, the drummer and co-founder of the Circle Jerks in 1979, was an early developer of hardcore drumming; he has been called the \\"Godfather of hardcore drumming\\" and Flipside zine calls him the best punk drummer. According to Tobias Hurwitz, '[h]ardcore drumming falls somewhere between the straight-ahead rock styles of old-school punk and the frantic, warp-speed bashing of thrash.\\" Some hardcore punk drummers play fast D beat one moment and then drop tempo into elaborate musical breakdowns in the next. Drummers typically play eighth notes on the cymbals, because at the tempos used in hardcore it would be difficult to play a smaller subdivision of the beat. =Dancing= The early 1980s hardcore punk scene developed slam dancing (also called moshing), a style of dance in which participants push or slam into each other, and stage diving. Moshing works as a vehicle for expressing anger by \\"represent[ing] a way of playing at violence or roughness that allowed participants to mark their difference from the banal niceties of middle-class culture.\\" Moshing is in another way a \\"parody of violence,\\"Palmer, Craig T. (Spring 2005). \\"Mummers and Moshers: Two Rituals of Trust in Changing Social Environments.\\" Retrieved 2014-11-29 that nevertheless leaves participants bruised and sometimes bleeding. The term mosh came into use in the early 1980s American hardcore scene in Washington, D.C. A performance by Fear on the 1981 Halloween episode of Saturday Night Live was cut short when moshers, including John Belushi and members of a few hardcore punk bands, invaded the stage, damaged studio equipment and used profanity. Those band members included John Joseph and Harley Flanagan of Cro-Mags and John Brannon of Negative Approach and Ian Mackaye of Minor Threat. Other early examples of American hardcore dancing can be seen in the documentaries Another State of Mind, Urban Struggle, The Decline of Western Civilization, American Hardcore, and 30 Years of Northwest Punk. =Fashion= Mike Watt, formerly the bassist for the Minutemen in a 2013 show. Many North American hardcore punk fans adopted a dressed-down style of T-shirts, jeans, combat boots or sneakers and crewcut-style haircuts. Women in the hardcore scene typically wore army pants, band T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts. Brockmeier, Siri C., ‚ÄúNot Just Boys‚Äô Fun?‚Äù: The Gendered Experience of American Hardcore, MA Thesis in American Studies Department of Literature, Area Studies and European Languages ILOS (Universitet I Oslo, 2009) p. 12 The clothing style was a reflection of hardcore ideology, which included dissatisfaction with suburban America and the hypocrisy of American culture. It was essentially deconstruction of American fashion staples‚Äîripped jeans, holey T-shirts, torn stockings for women, and work boots. The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers (elaborate hairdos, torn clothes, patches, safety pins, studs, spikes, etc.). Siri C. Brockmeier writes that \\"hardcore kids do not look like punks\\", since hardcore scene members wore basic clothing and short haircuts, in contrast to the \\"embellished leather jackets and pants\\" worn in the punk scene. p. 11 Lauraine Leblanc, however, claims that the standard hardcore punk clothing and styles included torn jeans, leather jackets, spiked armbands, dog collars, mohawk hairstyles, DIY ornamentation of clothes with studs, painted band names, political statements, and patches.Leblanc, Lauraine, Pretty in Punk: Girls' Gender Resistance in a Boys' Subculture. (Rutgers University Press, 1999), p. 52 Tiffini A. Travis and Perry Hardy describe the look that was common in the San Francisco hardcore scene as consisting of biker-style leather jackets, chains, studded wristbands, multiple piercings, painted or tattooed statements (e.g., an anarchy symbol) and hairstyles ranging from military-style haircuts dyed black or blonde to mohawks and shaved heads.Travis, Tiffini A. and Perry Hardy, Skinheads: A Guide to an American Subculture (ABC-CLIO, 2012), p. 123 (section entitled \\"From San Francisco Hardcore Punks to Skinheads\\") Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris wrote: \\"the ... punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But we had nothing to do with that. Black Flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who worked at the gas station or sub. shop.\\" Henry Rollins stated that for him, getting dressed up meant putting on a black shirt and some dark pants; taking an interest in fashion as being a distraction. Jimmy Gestapo from Murphy's Law describes his own transition from dressing in a punk style (spiked hair and a bondage belt) to adopting a hardcore style (shaved head and boots) as being based on needing more functional clothing. =Politics= Hardcore punk lyrics often express anti-establishment, anti-militarist, anti-authoritarian, anti-violence, and pro-environmentalist sentiments, in addition to other typically left-wing, anarchist, or egalitarian political views. During the 1980s, the subculture often rejected what was perceived to be \\"yuppie\\" materialism and interventionist American foreign policy. Numerous hardcore punk bands have taken far left political stances such as anarchism or other varieties of socialism and in the 1980s expressed opposition to political leaders such as then US president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Reagan's economic policies, sometimes dubbed Reaganomics, and social conservatism were common subjects for criticism by hardcore bands of the time. Jimmy Gestapo of Murphy's Law, however, endorsed Reagan and even went as far to call then former-president Jimmy Carter a \\"pussy\\" in a 1986 New York Magazine cover story. Shortly after Reagan's death in 2004, the Maximumrocknroll radio show aired an episode composed of anti-Reagan songs by early hardcore punk bands. Certain hardcore punk bands have conveyed messages sometimes deemed \\"politically incorrect\\" by placing offensive content in their lyrics and relying on stage antics to shock listeners and people in their audience. Boston band the F.U.'s generated controversy with their 1983 album, \\"My America\\", whose lyrics contained what appeared to be conservative and patriotic views. Its messages were sometimes taken literally, when they were actually intended as a parody of conservative bands. Another act from Massachusetts, Vile, were known to insult women, minorities and gay people in their lyrics and would even go as far as putting their albums on the windshields of people's cars. On the other hand, Tim Yohannan and the influential punk rock fanzine Maximumrocknroll were criticized by some punks for acting as the \\"politically correct scene police\\", having what was perceived to be \\"a very narrow definition of what fits into Punk\\", apparently being \\"authoritarian and trying to dominate the scene\\" with their views. During the 2001‚Äì2009 United States presidency of George W. Bush, it was not uncommon for hardcore bands to express anti-Bush messages. During the 2004 United States presidential election, several hardcore punk artists and bands were involved with the anti-Bush political activist group PunkVoter. A minority of hardcore musicians have expressed right wing views, such as the band Antiseen, whose guitarist Joe Young ran for public office as a North Carolina Libertarian. Former Misfits singer Michale Graves appeared on an episode of The Daily Show, voicing support for George W. Bush, on behalf of the Conservative Punk website. Etymology Hardcore historian Steven Blush states that the Vancouver-based band D.O.A.'s 1981 album, Hardcore '81 \\"was where the genre got its name.\\" This album also helped to make people aware of the term \\"hardcore\\". Konstantin Butz states that while the origin of the expression \\"hardcore\\" \\"cannot be ascribed to a specific place or time\\", the term is \\"usually associated with the further evolution of California's L.A. Punk Rock scene\\", which included young skateboarders.Butz, Konstantin. Grinding California: Culture and Corporeality in American Skate Punk. Verlag, 2014. p. 79 A September 1981 article by Tim Sommer shows the author applying the term to the \\"15 or so\\" punk bands gigging around the city at that time, which he considered a belated development relative to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington D.C.Tim Sommer Sounds 10 October 1981 Blush said that the term \\"hardcore\\" is also a reference to the sense of being \\"fed up\\" with the existing punk and new wave music. p. 9 Blush also states that the term refers to \\"an extreme: the absolute most Punk.\\"Steven Blush. American Hardcore: a Tribal History. Feral House, 2001. p. 18 Kelefa Sanneh states that the term \\"hardcore\\" referred to an attitude of \\"turning inwards\\" towards the scene and \\"ignoring broader society\\", all with the goal of achieving a sense of \\"shared purpose\\" and being part of a community. Sanneh cites Agnostic Front's band member selection approach as an example of hardcore's emphasis on \\"scene citizenship\\"; prospective members of the band were chosen based on being part of the local hardcore scene and being regularly in the moshing pit at shows, rather than based on a musical audition. History =Late 1970s and early 1980s= United States =Los Angeles= Michael Azerrad states that \\"[by] 1979 the original punk scene [in Southern California] had almost completely died out.\\" \\"They were replaced by a bunch of toughs coming in from outlying suburbs who were only beginning to discover punk's speed, power and aggression\\";\\"dispensing with all pretension, these kids boiled the music down to its essence, then revved up the tempos...and called the result \\"hardcore\\", creating a music that was \\"younger, faster and angrier, [and] full of...pent-up rage...\\" Hardcore historian Steven Blush states that for West coasters, the first hardcore record was Out of Vogue by the Santa Ana band Middle Class.Steven Blush. American Hardcore: A Tribal Tradition. Feral House, 2001. p. 19 The band pioneered a shouted, fast version of punk rock which would shape the hardcore sound that would soon emerge. In terms of impact upon the hardcore scene, Black Flag has been deemed the most influential group. Michael Azerrad, author of Our Band Could Be Your Life, calls Black Flag the \\"godfathers\\" of hardcore punk and states that even \\"...more than the flagship band of American hardcore\\", they were \\"...required listening for anyone who was interested in underground music.\\" Blush states that Black Flag defined American hardcore in the same way that the Sex Pistols defined punk. Formed in Hermosa Beach, California by guitarist and primary songwriter Greg Ginn, they played their first show in December 1977. Originally called Panic, they changed their name to Black Flag in 1978. By 1979, Black Flag were joined by another South Bay hardcore band, the Minutemen, who they shared a practice space with until both bands were evicted, as well as the Circle Jerks (which featured Black Flag's original singer, Keith Morris).Steven Blush. American Hardcore: a Tribal History. Feral House, 2010. p. 61 From Hollywood, two other bands playing hardcore punk, Fear and the Germs, were featured with Black Flag and the Circle Jerks in Penelope Spheeris' 1981 documentary The Decline of Western Civilization. By the time the film was released, other hardcore bands from Los Angeles County were also making a name for themselves including Bad Religion, Descendents, Red Kross, Rhino 39, Suicidal Tendencies, Wasted Youth, Youth Brigade, and Youth Gone Mad.Steven Blush. American Hardcore: a Tribal History. Feral House, 2010. p. 82-91, 108- Neighboring Orange County had the Adolescents, Agent Orange, China White, Shattered Faith, and T.S.O.L., while north of Los Angeles, around Oxnard, California, a hardcore scene known as \\"nardcore\\" developed with bands like Agression, Ill Repute, Dr. Know, and Rich Kids on LSD.Steven Blush. American Hardcore: a Tribal History. Feral House, 2010. p. 95-107 Whilst popular traditional punk bands such as the Ramones, the Clash, and Sex Pistols were signed to major record labels, the hardcore punk bands were generally not. Black Flag, however, was briefly signed to MCA subsidiary Unicorn Records, but were dropped because an executive considered their music to be \\"anti-parent\\". Instead of trying to be courted by the major labels, hardcore bands started their own independent record labels and distributed their records themselves. Ginn started SST Records, which released Black Flag's debut EP Nervous Breakdown in 1979. SST went on to release a number of albums by other hardcore artists, and was described by Azerrad as \\"easily the most influential and popular underground indie of the Eighties.\\" SST was followed by a number of other successful artist-run labels‚Äîincluding BYO Records (started by Shawn and Mark Stern of Youth Brigade), Epitaph Records (started by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion), New Alliance Records (started by the Minutemen's D. Boon and Mike Watt), as well as fan-run labels like Frontier Records and Slash Records. Bands also funded and organized their own tours. Black Flag's tours in 1980 and 1981 brought them in contact with developing hardcore scenes in many parts of North America, and blazed trails that were followed by other touring bands. Concerts in the early Los Angeles hardcore scene increasingly became sites of violent battles between police and concertgoers. Another source of violence in LA was tension created by what one writer calls the invasion of \\"antagonistic suburban poseurs\\" into hardcore venues.\\"Fantagraphics Books ‚Äì Los Bros. Hernandez\\". Fantagraphics.com. Retrieved 7 February 2012. Violence at hardcore concerts was portrayed in episodes of the popular television shows CHiPs and Quincy, M.E.. In the pre- Internet era, fanzines, commonly called zines, enabled hardcore scene members to learn about bands, clubs, and record labels. Zines typically included reviews of shows and records, interviews with bands, letters, ads for records and labels, and were DIY products, \\"proudly amateur, usually handmade. A zine called We Got Power described the Los Angeles scene from 1981 to 1984, and it included show reviews and band interviews with groups including D.O.A., the Misfits, Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies and the Circle Jerks. =San Francisco= Jello Biafra performing with the Dead Kennedys Shortly after Black Flag debuted in Los Angeles, Dead Kennedys were formed in San Francisco. While the band's early releases were played in a style closer to traditional punk rock, In God We Trust, Inc. (1981) marked a shift into hardcore. Similar to Black Flag and Youth Brigade, Dead Kennedys released their albums on their own label, which in DK's case was Alternative Tentacles. While not as large as the scene in Los Angeles, the hardcore scene of the early 1980s included a number of noteworthy bands originating from the San Francisco Bay Area, including Bl'ast, Crucifix, The Faction, Fang, Flipper, and Whipping Boy.Steven Blush. American Hardcore: a Tribal History. Feral House, 2010. p. 122-131 Additionally, during this time, seminal Texas-based bands Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, the Dicks, MDC, Rhythm Pigs, and Verbal Abuse all relocated to San Francisco.Steven Blush. American Hardcore: a Tribal History. Feral House, 2010. p. 126 The scene was helped in particular by the San Francisco club Mabuhay Gardens, whose promoter, Dirk Dirksen, became known as \\"The Pope of Punk\\". Another important local institution was Tim Yohannan's fanzine, Maximumrocknroll, as well as his show on Berkeley, California public radio station KPFA Maximum RocknRoll Radio Show, which played the younger Northern California bands. One of those bands was Tales of Terror from Sacramento. Many, including Mark Arm, cite Tales of Terror as a key inspiration for the then-burgeoning grunge scene. =Washington, D.C.= The first hardcore punk band to form on the east coast of the United States was Washington, D.C.'s Bad Brains. Initially formed in 1977 as a jazz fusion ensemble called Mind Power, and consisting of all African-American members, their early foray into hardcore featured some of the fastest tempos in rock music. The band released its debut single, \\"Pay to Cum\\", in 1980, and were influential in establishing the D.C. hardcore scene. Hardcore historian Steven Blush calls the single the first East coast hardcore record.Steven Blush. American Hardcore: A Tribal Tradition.\\" Feral House, 2001. p. 19 Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, influenced by Bad Brains, formed the band Teen Idles in 1979. The group broke up in 1980, and MacKaye and Nelson went on to form Minor Threat, who became a big influence on the hardcore punk genre. The band used faster rhythms and more aggressive, less melodic riffs than was common at the time. Minor Threat popularized the straight edge movement with its song \\"Straight Edge\\", which spoke out against alcohol, drugs and promiscuity. MacKaye and Nelson ran their own record label, Dischord Records, which released records by D.C. hardcore bands including: the Faith, Iron Cross, Scream, State of Alert, Government Issue, Void, and DC's Youth Brigade. The Flex Your Head compilation was a seminal document of the early 1980s DC hardcore scene. The record label was run out of the Dischord House, a Washington, D.C. punk house. Henry Rollins, who would come to prominence as lead singer of the California-based Black Flag, as well as his own later Rollins Band, grew up in Washington D.C., singing for State of Alert, and was influenced by the music of Bad Brains and the bands of his childhood friend Ian MacKaye.Azerrad, Michael. Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981‚Äì1991. Little Brown and Company, 2001. . =Boston= Seminal Boston area hardcore bands included the F.U.'s, the Freeze, Gang Green, Jerry's Kids, Siege, DYS, Negative FX, and SS Decontrol. Members of the latter three bands were influenced by D.C.'s straight edge scene, and were part of \\"the Boston Crew\\", a mostly straight edge group of friends known to physically fight people who used alcohol or drugs. Members of the Boston Crew would later go on to form the band Slapshot, and also included future Mighty Mighty Bosstones singer Dicky Barrett, who was then a member of the band Impact Unit, and drew the artwork for the DYS album Brotherhood. In 1982, Modern Method Records released This Is Boston, Not L.A., a compilation album of the Boston hardcore scene. In addition to Modern Method was Taang! Records, who released material by a number of the aforementioned Boston hardcore bands. Further outside of Boston were Western Massachusetts bands Deep Wound (which featured future Dinosaur Jr. members J Mascis and Lou Barlow) and the Outpatients, both of whom would come to Boston to play shows. From New Hampshire was G.G. Allin, a solo singer who contrary to straight edge used copious drugs and eventually died of a heroin overdose. Allin's stage show included defecating on stage and then throwing his feces at the audience. =New York= Facade of the music club CBGB in New York CityThe New York City hardcore scene emerged in 1981 when Bad Brains moved to the city from Washington, D.C. Starting in 1981, there was an influx of new hardcore bands in the city including Agnostic Front, Beastie Boys, Cro-Mags, The Mob, Murphy's Law, Reagan Youth, and Warzone. A number of other bands associated with New York hardcore scene came from New Jersey, including Misfits, Adrenalin OD and Hogan's Heroes.1948‚Äì1999 Muze, Inc. Hogan's Heroes Section 207. Steven Blush calls the Misfits \\"crucial to the rise of hardcore.\\"Steven Blush. American Hardcore: A Tribal Tradition. Feral House, 2001. p. 195 New York hardcore had more emphasis on rhythm, in part due to the use of palm-muted guitar chords, an approach called the NY hardcore \\"chug\\". The New York scene was known for its tough ethos, its \\"thuggery\\", and club shows that were a chaotic \\"proving ground\\" or even a \\"battleground\\". The early 1980s, the New York hardcore scene centered around squats and clubhouses. After these were closed down, the scene was emanating in a small after-hours bar, A7, on the lower east side of Manhattan, and later around the famous bar CBGB. For several years, CBGB held weekly hardcore matinees on Sundays. The matinees stopped in 1990 when violence led Kristal to ban hardcore shows at the club.Jeffrey Wengrofsky, \\"Punk Rock Fight Club\\" Trebuchet Magazine, https://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/punk-rock-fight-club/ Agnostic Front performing. Early radio support in New York's surrounding tri- state area came from Pat Duncan, who had hosted live punk and hardcore bands weekly on WFMU since 1979. Bridgeport, Connecticut's WPKN had a radio show featuring hardcore called Capital Radio, hosted by Brad Morrison, beginning in February 1979 and continuing weekly until late 1983. In New York City, Tim Sommer hosted Noise The Show on WNYU. By 1984, the Ramones, one of the original New York punk bands, were experimenting with hardcore, with two songs, \\"Wart Hog\\" and \\"Endless Vacation\\" on their album Too Tough To Die. =Other American regions= Minneapolis hardcore consisted of bands such as H√ºsker D√º and the Replacements, while Chicago had Articles of Faith, Big Black and Naked Raygun. The Detroit area was home to Crucifucks, Degenerates, the Meatmen, Negative Approach, Spite and Violent Apathy. From Ohio was Maumee's Necros and Dayton's Toxic Reasons. The zine Touch and Go covered this Midwest hardcore scene from 1979 to 1983. JFA and Meat Puppets were both from Phoenix, Arizona;, 7 Seconds were from Reno, Nevada; and Butthole Surfers, Big Boys, the Dicks, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles (D.R.I.), Really Red, Verbal Abuse and MDC were from Texas. Portland, Oregon hardcore punk bands included Poison Idea and Final Warning, while north of there, Washington state included the Acc√ºsed, Melvins, the Fartz, and 10 Minute Warning (the latter two included future Guns N' Roses member Duff McKagan). Other prominent hardcore bands from this time that came from areas without large scenes include Raleigh, North Carolina's Corrosion of Conformity. Canada D.O.A. formed in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1978 and were one of the first bands to refer to its style as \\"hardcore\\", with the release of their album Hardcore '81. Other early hardcore bands from British Columbia included Dayglo Abortions, the Subhumans and the Skulls. Nomeansno is a hardcore band originally from Victoria, British Columbia and now located in Vancouver. SNFU formed in Edmonton in 1981 and also later relocated to Vancouver. Bunchofuckingoofs, from the Kensington Market neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, formed in November 1983 as a response to \\"a local war with glue huffing Nazi skinheads.\\" In Montreal, The Asexuals helped fertilize a scene that became a necessary tour stop for punk and hardcore bands headed to the Northeast. United Kingdom The UK anarcho-punk and D-beat band Antisect playing in Brighton in 1985. In the United Kingdom a fertile hardcore scene took root early on. Referred to under a number of names including \\"U.K. Hardcore\\", \\"UK 82\\", \\"second wave punk\\",Glasper 2004, p. 8-9 \\"real punk\\",Liner notes, Discharge, Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing, Castle, 2003 and \\"No Future punk\\",Glasper 2004, p. 384. it took the previous punk sound and added the incessant, heavy drumbeats and heavily distorted guitar sound of new wave of British heavy metal bands, especially Mot√∂rhead.Glasper 2004, p. 47 Formed in 1977 in Stoke-on-Trent, Discharge played a large role in influencing other European hardcore bands. AllMusic calls the band's sound a \\"high-speed noise overload\\" characterized by \\"ferocious noise blasts.\\" Their style of hardcore punk was coined as D-beat, a term referring to a distinctive drum beat that a number of 1980s imitators of Discharge are associated with.\\"I just wanna be remembered for coming up with that f-ckin' D-beat in the first place! And inspiring all those f-ckin' great Discore bands around the world!\\" ‚Äì Terry \\"Tez\\" Roberts, Glasper 2004, p. 175. Another UK band, the Varukers, were one of the original D-beat bands,Glasper 2004, p. 65. Scottish band the Exploited were also influential, with the term \\"UK 82\\" (used to refer to UK hardcore in the early 1980s) being taken from one of their songs. They contrasted with early American hardcore bands by placing an emphasis on appearance. Frontman Walter \\"Wattie\\" Buchan had a giant red mohawk and the band continued to wear swastikas, an approach influenced by the wearing of this symbol by 1970s punks such as Sid Vicious. Because of this, the Exploited were labeled by others in the scene as \\"cartoon punks\\".Glasper 2004, p. 360 Other influential UK hardcore bands from this period included Anti-Establishment, Antisect, Broken Bones, Chaos UK, Charged GBH, Conflict, Dogsflesh, English Dogs, and grindcore innovators Napalm Death. Other countries There was a dynamic Italian hardcore punk scene in the 1980s. Inspired by UK bands such as Crass and Discharge, many Italian groups had lyrics that were anti-war and anti-NATO. Groups included Wretched, Raw Power, and Negazione. The Last White Christmas festival, held in Pisa on Dec. 4, 1983, was an important concert for Italian groups. Sweden developed several influential hardcore bands, including Anti Cimex, Disfear, and Mob 47. Finland produced some influential hardcore bands, including Terveet K√§det, one of the first hardcore groups to emerge in the country. In Eastern Europe notable hardcore bands included Hungaria's Galloping Coroners from 1975, Yugoslavia's 1980s-era Niet from Ljubljana, and KBO! A Japanese hardcore scene arose to protest the social and economic changes sweeping the country in the late 1970s and during the 1980s. The band SS is regarded as the first, forming in 1977. Bands such as the Stalin and GISM soon followed, both forming in 1980. Other notable Japanese hardcore bands include: Balzac, Disclose (a D-beat band), Garlic Boys, Gauze, SOB, and the Star Club. =Mid to late 1980s= Genre changes Corrosion of Conformity playing in Denver in 1986 The Replacements The mid-1980s were a time of transition for the hardcore scene, with a number of influential bands from earlier in the decade changing their sound or breaking up. Starting with their 1984 album My War, which coincided with the band members growing their hair long, Black Flag were criticized for having ‚Äúgone heavy metal‚Äù. The albums second side was called a road map for sludge metal, as well as being influenced by doom metal bands. Black Flag's eventual breakup in 1986, would coincide with the breakup of one of the other most influential hardcore bands, the Dead Kennedys. By 1985, Boston bands SS Decontrol and DYS became metal bands, while The F.U.'s did the same, but changed their name to \\"Straw Dogs\\".Steven Blush. American Hardcore: a Tribal History. Feral House, 2010. p. 190-191 By the end of the year, both SSD and DYS had broken up. Other bands in the mid-80s that went from being strictly hardcore to adding more metal riffs, developed an even heavier sound, with Corrosion of Conformity, Cro-Mags, and D.R.I., becoming known as crossover thrash bands. Bad Religion briefly broke up in 1984, after making the progressive rock album Into the Unknown. They returned to their roots on the 1985 Back to the Known EP, and then began their embrace of more melodic straightforward punk rock, starting with 1988's Suffer. In 1986, Los Angeles's Youth Brigade changed their name to \\"The Brigade\\", and changed their sound to a style that The Los Angeles Times compared to mainstream bands like U2, R.E.M., and Big Country. They would breakup the next year. Bands such as Minutemen, Meat Puppets, H√ºsker D√º, and the Replacements, changed their style becoming alternative rock. T.S.O.L, who had already embraced goth rock, became a hard rock band with 1986's Revenge, being compared to Poison and Faster Pussycat, and going on tour with Guns N' Roses. Red Kross's second album, 1987's Neurotica, was described as a blend of pop rock and art rock. The Beastie Boys gained fame by playing hip hop, and Bad Brains incorporated more reggae into their music, such as in their 1989 album Quickness. Youth crew During the later 1980s, a new group of bands emerged influenced by straight edge, known as the youth crew movement. Extending on original straight edge bands groundwork of lyrically expressing views against drugs, alcohol and promiscuous sex, youth crew also focused on issues such as vegetarianism or veganism. The movement consisted of bands such as Bold, Gorilla Biscuits, and Youth of Today in the New York area, Chain of Strength and Inside Out in Southern California, and a scene in Durham, England heavily inspired by the sound of U.S. youth crew and straight edge bands. Members of the Durham scene would eventually form the band the Voorhees. Youth of Today at a 2010 show. =1990s and 2000s= In the beginning of the 1990s, a variety of different styles of hardcore bands arose, such as melodic hardcore (Avail, Lifetime, Kid Dynamite), emo (Endpoint), D-beat (Aus Rotten), powerviolence (Charles Bronson, Dropdead, Rorschach), thrashcore (Voorhees), mathcore (Converge), screamo (Heroin, Portraits of Past) and rapcore (Biohazard). While the 1990s had many different sounds and styles emerging, the genre primarily branched into two directions; new school metallic hardcore (also referred as metalcore), which incorporated aspects of thrash metal and death metal for a heavier and more technical sound, and old school, reminiscent of the classic beginnings of hardcore punk. \\"New school\\" bands such as Earth Crisis, Snapcase, Strife, Hatebreed, 108, Integrity and Damnation A.D. dominated the scene in the early 1990s, but towards the end of the decade, a new-found interest in \\"old school\\" had developed, represented by bands like Battery, Ten Yard Fight, In My Eyes, Good Clean Fun, H2O and Better Than a Thousand.SAVEYOURSCENE.COM. Interviews: Good Clean Fun.. Retrieved 2009-08-30.Insound. MP3: Ten Yard Fight, \\"Hardcore Pride\\".. Retrieved 2009-08-30. A Swedish hardcore scene also emerged in the 1990s, with bands such as Refused and Raised Fist. Straight edge and hardline During this time, a more militant subculture of straight edge called hardline emerged. In the late 90s, Elgin James, a musician involved in the militant faction of the Boston straight edge scene, helped found the organization Friends Stand United. By the early 2000s, there were FSU chapters in Philadelphia, Chicago, Arizona, Los Angeles, Seattle, upstate New York and New Jersey, and they were considered to have about 200 members. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, eventually classified FSU as a street gang, which used violent methods and repeatedly assault people at hardcore shows and on Boston streets. In conjunction with the gang activities, James eventually did time in jail for extortion. In addition to James' band Righteous Jams, straight edge hardcore bands from this era also included fellow Boston area bands Bane, Embrace Today, Have Heart, In My Eyes, Ten Yard Fight, Verse, and Youth Attack. Outside of Boston were straight edge scenes in Southern California with bands such as Chain of Strength, Inside Out, Over My Dead Body, Strife, Throwdown, and Unbroken, Seattle with Champion, Trial, and Undertow, while Arma Angelus, Harm's Way, all came from Chicago. Other bands across the world included Abhinanda, Allegiance, Battery, Bishop, Casey Jones, Clear, Count Me Out, Down to Nothing, Final Exit, The Geeks, Indecision, Liferuiner, Mouthpiece, Rambo, Separation, Snapcase, Step Forward, Vitamin X, Wisdom in Chains, and xCrosscheckx, as well as bands that combined straight edge with animal rights like Earth Crisis, ACxDC, Asunto, Chokehold, First Blood, Good Clean Fun, Most Precious Blood, One King Down, Point of No Return, Raid, and Vegan Reich. Further bands meshed straight edge with additional causes such as Christian hardcore bands Call to Preserve, The Red Baron, xLooking Forwardx, Jewish band Sons of Abraham, queercore band Limp Wrist, right-wing anti- immigrant band One Life Crew, and anti-capitalism bands Manliftingbanner and Refused. Mainstream success During this era in mainstream music, punk rock became a mainstream success in 1994 with popular bands like Green Day, The Offspring, and Rancid. While typically playing pop punk, Green Day's 1997 album Nimrod contained two songs (\\"Platypus [I Hate You]\\" and \\"Take Back\\") that were described as hardcore, while The Offspring frontman Dexter Holland started Nitro Records, a label which released music from a number of hardcore bands including AFI, A Wilhelm Scream, Crime in Stereo, Ensign, The Letters Organize, No Trigger, and T.S.O.L.. Meanwhile, Rancid would record a hardcore album with 2000's Rancid. Singer Nuno Pereira performing at A Wilhelm Scream show The same year punk became popular again in 1994, Sick of It All released the major label album Scratch the Surface. According to lead singer Lou Koller, people were thinking they would go from a hardcore band to sounding like Green Day, so they intentionally made an album heavier than anything they'd done before. The album became a surprise success, with the single \\"Step Down\\" becoming a staple on MTV, thanks to a tongue-in-cheek music video featuring a roving reporter ‚Äúexposing‚Äù the world of hardcore, and showing how to do various hardcore dance moves. With the increased popularity of punk rock in the mid-1990s and the 2000s, additional hardcore bands signed with major record labels. The next was New York's H2O, who released its album Go (2001) for MCA. Despite an extensive tour and an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, the album was not commercially successful, and when the label folded, the band and the label parted ways. In 2002, AFI signed to DreamWorks Records but changed their sound considerably for its successful major label debut Sing the Sorrow. Chicago's Rise Against were signed by Geffen Records, and three of its releases on the label were certified platinum by the RIAA. Like AFI, Rise Against gradually diminished hardcore elements from their music, culminating with 2008's Appeal to Reason, which lacked the intensity found in their earlier albums. Notable independent label Bridge 9 Records saw several of their artists rise to prominence, including Defeater, Verse and Have Heart, who had a Billboard chart entry with their second album, 'Songs To Scream At The Sun'. In an AllMusic review, Greg Prato wrote about the label's band Energy that \\"While you wouldn't go quite as far as calling Energy \\"a hardcore Boy band,\\" the group's leanings toward the mainstream are undeniable throughout Invasions of the Mind\\". United Kingdom band Gallows were signed to Warner Bros. Records for ¬£1 million. Their major label debut Grey Britain was described as being even more aggressive than their previous material, and the band was subsequently dropped from the label. The success of the band led to other British hardcore acts of the time gain notability like The Ghost of a Thousand and Heights. Los Angeles band the Bronx briefly appeared on Island Def Jam Music Group for the release of their 2006 self-titled album, which was named one of the top 40 albums of the year by Spin magazine. They appeared in the Darby Crash biopic What We Do Is Secret, playing members of Black Flag. In 2007, Toronto's Fucked Up appeared on MTV Live Canada, where they were introduced as \\"Effed Up\\". During the performance of its song \\"Baiting the Public\\", the majority of the audience was moshing, which caused $2000 in damages to the set. Fucked Up went on to win the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for the album The Chemistry of Common Life. Australian hardcore also took off during this time with bands like Break Even and 50 Lions (formed in 2005), and Iron Mind (formed in 2006). The genre was played on the national Triple J network on the short.fast.loud program. Australian labels that released hardcore music include Broken Hive Records, Resist Records and UNFD Records. =2010s= Partly due to developments in digital communications, there has been a rise in interaction between hardcore scenes in different places and subgenres, particularly in Europe. In September 2017, Bandcamp Daily wrote that Fluff Fest, which has been held in Czechia since 2000 and features an international lineup of independent bands ranging in style from crust punk to screamo, \\"has established itself as the main DIY hardcore punk event in Europe\\". Code Orange formed in Pittsburgh in 2008, their 2014 sophomore album I Am King reached number 96 on the Billboard 200, and its follow up, 2017's Forever peaked and number 62. Baltimore hardcore band Turnstile, who formed in 2010, signed Roadrunner Records in 2017 and released their sophomore album Time & Space in 2018, which reached number one on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. Kentucky hardcore band Knocked Loose formed in 2013 and released their debut album Laugh Tracks in 2016, which peaked at number 163 on the Billboard 200. Its follow up A Different Shade of Blue was released in 2019 and peaked at number 26. Other bands like Varials, SeeYouSpaceCowboy, Vein and Wristmeetrazor also gained popularity during this period. In the mid‚Äì2010s a number of British hardcore punk bands began being represented as members of a new musical movement dubbed the New Wave of British Hardcore (often abbreviated to NWOBHC), a term coined by Adam Malik from The Essence Records. Bands who are a part of the movement generally take influence from '80s Boston and New York hardcore bands. Bands associated with the movement include Arms Race, Violent Reaction, Big Cheese, Higher Power, Perspex Flesh, Mob Rules, the Flex and Blind Authority. Some bands such as Rapture, Violent Reaction and Payday are straight edge. In 2019, Boston hardcore band Have Heart reunited for performances in four different locations after a ten-year breakup. One of these performances was outside the Worcester Palladium, which drew around 10,000 attendees, making the most attended hardcore show that wasn't a festival. Hardcore in the late-2010s saw a significant growth of the scene, to involve bands taking influence from style generally disassociated with it, such as industrial, heavy metal, post-punk and nu metal. Around this time, mainstream rappers began to associate themselves with the hardcore scene. Playboi Carti included a performance from a hardcore show as the front cover for his 2018 album Die Lit, Denzel Curry collaborated with Bad Brains and Fucked Up in 2019 and rap groups Suicideboys and City Morgue were joined on tour by hardcore bands Turnstile and Trash Talk. Rappers Wicca Phase Springs Eternal and Ghostemane even began playing music by performing in hardcore bands. In September 2019, rap group Injury Reserve released a collaborative track with Code Orange and JPEGMafia. The Kominas at a Chicago show in 2007. In recent years, Muslim hardcore bands have emerged in the US, Canada, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The development of Muslim hardcore has been traced to the impact of a 2010 film Taqwacore, a documentary about the Muslim hardcore scene. Bands include the Kominas from Boston, the all-girl Secret Trial Five from Toronto, Al Thawra (The Power) from Chicago \\"and even a few bands out in Pakistan and Indonesia.\\"Sanjiv Bhattacharya. \\"How Islamic punk went from fiction to reality.\\" The Guardian, Thursday 4 August 2011. Available online at: Accessed on July 28, 2014. Influence Hardcore punk has spawned a number of subgenres, fusion genres and derivative forms. Its subgenres include D-beat, emo, melodic hardcore and thrashcore. Important fusion genres include crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, and metalcore, all of which fuse hardcore punk with extreme metal. Key derivatives include and skate punk, and hardcore punk has also influenced a number of heavy metal sub genres. Metallica and Slayer, pioneers of the heavy metal subgenre thrash metal, were influenced by a number of hardcore bands. Metallica's cover album Garage Inc. included covers of two Discharge and three Misfits songs, while Slayer's cover album Undisputed Attitude consisted of covers of predominately hardcore punk bands. The Washington state band Melvins, aside from their influence on grunge, helped create what would be known as sludge metal, which is also a combination between Black Sabbath-style music and hardcore punk. This genre developed during the early 1990s, in the Southern United States (particularly in the New Orleans metal scene). Some of the pioneering bands of sludge metal were: Eyehategod, Crowbar, Down, Buzzov*en, Acid Bath and Corrosion of Conformity. Later, bands such as Isis and Neurosis, with similar influences, created a style that relies mostly on ambience and atmosphere that would eventually be named atmospheric sludge metal or post-metal. =Fusion and subgenres= D-beat D-beat (also known as discore or k√§ngpunk) is a hardcore punk subgenre, developed in the early 1980s by imitators of the band Discharge, after whom the genre is named, as well as a drum beat characteristic of this subgenre. The bands Discharge and the Varukers are pioneers of the D-beat genre. Robbie Mackey of Pitchfork Media described D-beat as \\"hardcore drumming set against breakneck riffage and unintelligible howls about anarchy, working-stiffs-as-rats, and banding together to, you know, fight.\\" Guy Picciotto of Rites of Spring and Fugazi Emo and post- hardcore The 1980s saw the development of post-hardcore, which took the hardcore style in a more complex and dynamic direction, with a focus on singing rather than screaming. The post-hardcore style first took shape in Chicago, with bands such as Big Black, the Effigies and Naked Raygun. It later developed in Washington, DC within the community of bands on Ian MacKaye's Dischord Records, with bands such as Fugazi, the Nation of Ulysses, and Jawbox. The style has extended until the late 2000s. The mid-80s Washington, D.C. post-hardcore scene would also see the birth of emo. Guy Picciotto formed Rites of Spring in 1984, breaking free of hardcore's self-imposed boundaries in favor of melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and deeply personal, impassioned lyrics dealing with nostalgia, romantic bitterness, and poetic desperation.Greenwald, p. 12-13. Other D.C. bands such as Gray Matter, Beefeater, Fire Party, Dag Nasty, also became connected to this movement.Greenwald, p. 14. The style was dubbed \\"emo\\", \\"emo-core\\", or \\"post- harDCore\\" (in reference to one of the names given to the Washington, D.C. hardcore sceneGrubbs, p. 14.). Thrashcore and powerviolence Often confused with crossover thrash and sometimes thrash metal, is thrashcore. Thrashcore (also known as fastcore) is a subgenre of hardcore punk that emerged in the early 1980s.Felix von Havoc. Maximumrocknroll. Issue 219 It is essentially sped-up hardcore punk, with bands often using blast beats. Just as hardcore punk groups distinguished themselves from their punk rock predecessors by their greater intensity and aggression, thrashcore groups (often identified simply as \\"thrash\\") sought to play at breakneck tempos that would radicalize the innovations of hardcore. Early American thrashcore groups included Cryptic Slaughter (Santa Monica), D.R.I. (Houston), Septic Death (Boise) and Siege (Weymouth, Massachusetts). Thrashcore spun off into powerviolence, another raw and dissonant subgenre of hardcore punk. Other notable powerviolence bands include Man is the Bastard and Spazz. Grindcore Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that began the early to mid-1980s. Grindcore music relies on heavy metal instrumentation and eventually changed into a genre similar to death metal. Grindcore vocals, according to AllMusic, range \\"from high-pitched shrieks to low, throat- shredding growls and barks\\". Grindcore also features blast beats; according to Adam MacGregor of Dusted, \\"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\\" The band Napalm Death invented the grindcore genre; their debut album Scum was described by AllMusic as \\"perhaps the most representative example of\\" grindcore. Heavy hardcore Heavy hardcore is a style of hardcore punk which has deep, hoarse vocals, down-tuned electric guitars, blast beats, and slow breakdowns. More heavy metal-influenced than traditional hardcore punk, Strife, Shai Hulud, Madball and Hatebreed all are heavy hardcore bands. Metalcore Metalcore is a fusion genre that merges hardcore punk with extreme metal. Metalcore has screaming, growling, heavy guitar riffs, breakdowns, and double bass drumming. Heavy metal-hardcore punk hybrids arose in the mid-1980s and would also radicalize the innovations of hardcore as the two genres and their ideologies intertwined noticeably, resulting in two main genres one being metalcore. The term has been used to refer to bands that were not purely hardcore nor purely metal such as Earth Crisis, Integrity and Hogan's Heroes.1948‚Äì1999 Muze, Inc. Hogan's Heroes. Pop Artists Beginning with Hod, Phonolog, 1999, p. 1. No. 7-278B Section 207. During the 2000s there was a metalcore explosionKerrang, 10 metalcore/deathcore bands you probably don‚Äôt remember and bands like Bullet for My Valentine, Killswitch Engage, Atreyu, Shadows Fall, and As I Lay Dying all had some popularity. Grunge In the mid-1980s, northern West Coast bands such as Melvins, Flipper and Green River developed a sludgy, \\"aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore,\\" creating an alternative rock subgenre known as grunge. Grunge evolved from the local Seattle punk rock scene, and it was inspired by bands such as the Fartz, 10 Minute Warning and the Acc√ºsed.Pray, D., Helvey-Pray Productions (1996). Hype! Republic Pictures. Grunge fuses elements of hardcore and heavy metal, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Grunge's key guitar influences included Black Flag and the Melvins.Prown, Pete and Newquist, Harvey P. Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists. Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997. p. 242-243 Black Flag's 1984 record My War, on which the band combined heavy metal with their traditional sound, made a strong impact in Seattle.Azerrad, Michael.

In 1997, P√§√§bo and colleagues reported their successful sequencing of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), originating from a specimen found in Feldhofer grotto in the Neander valley. In August 2002, P√§√§bo's department published findings about the \\"language gene\\", FOXP2, which is lacking or damaged in some individuals with language disabilities. In 2006, P√§√§bo announced a plan to reconstruct the entire genome of Neanderthals. In 2007, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of the year. In February 2009, at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Chicago, it was announced that the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology had completed the first draft version of the Neanderthal genome.Callaway, Ewen (12 February 2009) First draft of Neanderthal genome is unveiled New Scientist, Life, Retrieved 13 February 2015 Over 3 billion base pairs were sequenced in collaboration with the 454 Life Sciences Corporation. This project, led by P√§√§bo, will shed new light on the recent evolutionary history of modern humans. In March 2010, P√§√§bo and his coworkers published a report about the DNA analysis of a finger bone found in the Denisova Cave in Siberia; the results suggest that the bone belonged to an extinct member of the genus Homo that had not yet been recognized, the Denisova hominin. In May 2010, P√§√§bo and his colleagues published a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome in the journal Science.. He and his team also concluded that there was probably interbreeding between Neanderthals and Eurasian (but not Sub-Saharan African) humans. There is growing support in the scientific community for this theory of admixture between archaic and anatomically-modern humans, though some archaeologists remain skeptical about this conclusion. In 2014, he published the book Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes where he in the mixed form of a memoir and popular science tells the story of the research effort to map the Neanderthal genome combined with thought on human evolution.Peter Forbes (20 February 2014) Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes by Svante P√§√§bo ‚Äì reviewSimon Underdown (3 April 2014) Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes, by Svante P√§√§bo Times Higher Education.

In the latter period he was a paid commissioner of Sweden in the Netherlands and he played a dubious but key role in Peter Minuit's expedition that led to the Swedish colonizing of New Sweden. In 1645 he was appointed for a third time as a manager of the WIC, being one of the main investors from the beginning.

For years Blommaert was involved in the copper trade and industry. In 1627 he had an argument about a cargo of 34 Swedish guns.Klein, P.W. (1963) De Trippen in de 17e eeuw, p. 279.

Burgh.http://www.nationaalarchief.nl/transcripties/blommaert_index.html In company with Godyn, a fellow-director, he bargained with the natives for a tract of land reaching from Cape Henlopen to the mouth of the Delaware River.http://www.hetverhalenarchief.nl/image/59 This was in 1629, three years before the charter of Maryland, and is the oldest deed for land in the state of Delaware. The purchase was ratified in 1630 by Peter Minuit and his council at Fort Amsterdam.The First Settlers ( Delaware Living History) http://www.delawareliving.com/history.html A company was formed to colonize the tract that included Blommaert, Godyn, Kiliaen van Rensselaer (Patroon of Rensselaerswyck), Joannes de Laet (the geographer), and David Pietersen de Vries. A ship of eighteen guns was fitted out to bring over the colonists and subsequently defend the coast, with incidental whale-fishing to help defray expenses. A colony of more than thirty souls was planted on Lewes creek, a little north of Cape Henlopen, and its governorship was entrusted to Gillis Hosset. This settlement antedated by several years any in Pennsylvania, and the colony at Lewes practically laid the foundation and defined the singularly limited area of the state of Delaware, the major part of which was included in the purchase. A palisaded fort was built, with the \\"red lion, rampant,\\" of Holland affixed to its gate, and the country was named Swaanendael or Zwaanendael Colony, while the water was called Godyn's Bay now known as Delaware Bay. The estate was further extended, on May 5, 1630, by the purchase of a tract twelve miles square on the coast of Cape May opposite, and the transaction was duly attested at Fort Amsterdam. The existence of the little colony was short, for the Indians came down upon it in revenge for an arbitrary act on the part of Hosset, and it was destroyed, not a soul escaping to tell the tale. According to acknowledged precedent, occupancy of the wilderness served to perfect title; but before the Dutch could reoccupy the desolated site at Lewes, the English were practically in possession.Isaack de Rasieres to Samuel Blommaert 1628 (Caleb Johnson.

Soon after he left, Blommaert started to send letters to the chancellor to advise him. In 1636, Blommaert became the consul for Sweden in Amsterdam.Klein, P.W. (1963) De Trippen in de 17e eeuw, p. 374. Blommaert tried to attract workers and experts from Aachen.J. R√∂melingh (1986) Een rondgang langs de Zweedse archieven, p. 247, 158, 247, 267 He secretly assisted with the fitting out of the first Swedish expedition with Fogel Grip and Kalmar Nyckel to New Sweden in 1637 and engaged Peter Minuit to command it. When two expeditions turned out to be unprofitable for Blommaert, he withdrew. In those years, Blommaert was too heavily interested in seizing Spanish ships, which sailed from the Caribbean loaded with silver, to make the New Sweden colonization more successful. Blommaert's thirty-eight letters to the Swedish chancellor Count Axel Oxenstierna, from 1635 to 1641 are of great importance to the history of New Sweden. These letters were published in Repertorium Veterrimarum Societatum Litterariarum 1870‚Äì1879 of the Utrecht Historical Society and in Bijdragen en Mededeelingen (1908).Journal-Title Abbreviations in Old Journals in the Repertorium Veterrimarum Societatum Litterariarum 1870‚Äì1879 References Primary Source * Jameson, J.F. editor.

Bashkirtseff lived and worked in Paris for many years, and died at age 25. Life and painting career Church of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, where Maria was christened Mary's father, Konstantin Pavlovich Maria Bashkyrtseva in Ukrainian folk costumes The house of Bashkirtseffs in Gavrontsi,Ukraine Bashkirtseff was born Maria Konstantinovna Bashkirtseva in Gavrontsi near Poltava (now Ukraine) to a wealthy noble family, but her parents separated when she was quite young. As a result, she grew up mostly abroad, traveling with her mother throughout most of Europe, with longer spells in Germany and on the Riviera, until the family settled in Paris. Educated privately and with early musical talent, she lost her chance at a career as a singer when illness destroyed her voice. She then determined to become an artist, and she studied painting in France at the Robert-Fleury studio and at the Acad√©mie Julian. The Acad√©mie, as one of the few establishments that accepted female students, attracted young women from all over Europe and the United States. Fellow students at the Acad√©mie included Anna Bili≈Ñska-Bohdanowiczowa and especially Louise Breslau, whom Bashkirtseff viewed as her only real rival. Bashkirtseff would go on to produce a remarkable, if fairly conventional, body of work in her short lifetime, exhibiting at the Paris Salon as early as 1880 and every year thereafter until her death (except 1883). In 1884, she exhibited a portrait of Paris slum children entitled The Meeting and a pastel portrait of her cousin, for which she received an honorable mention. Bashkirtseff's best-known works are The Meeting (now in the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris) and her 1881 In the Studio, a portrait of her fellow artists at work. Although a large number of Bashkirtseff's works were destroyed by the Nazis during World War II, at least 60 survive. In 2000, a U.S. touring exhibition entitled \\"Overcoming All the Obstacles: The Women of Academy Julian\\" featured works by Bashkirtseff and her schoolmates. In the Studio by Marie Bashkirtseff (1881), who portrays herself as the central figure seated in the foreground As a painter, Bashkirtseff took her cue from her friend Jules Bastien-Lepage's admiration for realism and naturalism. Where Bastien-Lepage had found his inspiration in nature, Bashkirtseff turned to the urban scene, writing, \\"I say nothing of the fields because Bastien-Lepage reigns over them as a sovereign; but the streets, however, have not yet had their... Bastien.\\" By unlucky chance, both artists succumbed prematurely to chronic illness in the same year, and the later pages of Bashkirtseff's journal record her visits to the dying painter. Dying of tuberculosis at the age of 25, Bashkirtseff lived just long enough to emerge as an intellectual in Paris in the 1880s. She wrote several articles for Hubertine Auclert's feminist newspaper La Citoyenne in 1881 under the nom de plume \\"Pauline Orrel.\\" One of her most-quoted sayings is \\"Let us love dogs, let us love only dogs! Men and cats are unworthy creatures.\\" Bashkirtseff died in Paris in 1884, and she is buried in Cimeti√®re de Passy, Paris. Her great friend Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch was present at her deathbed. Her monument is a full-sized artist's studio that has been declared a historic monument by the government of France. Marie Bashkirtseff was included in the 2018 exhibit Women in Paris 1850-1900 The diary From approximately the age of 13, Bashkirtseff kept a journal, and it is probably for this that she is most famous today. It has been called \\"a strikingly modern psychological self- portrait of a young, gifted mind,\\" and her urgent prose, which occasionally breaks out into dialogue, remains extremely readable. She was multilingual and despite her self-involvement, was a keen observer with an acute ear for hypocrisy, so that her journal also offers a near-novelistic account of the late nineteenth century European bourgeoisie. A consistent theme throughout her journal is her deep desire to achieve fame, inflected by her increasing fear that her intermittent illnesses might turn out to be tuberculosis. In a prefatory section written toward the end of her life, in which she recounts her family history, she writes, \\"If I do not die young I hope to live as great artist; but if I die young, I intend to have my journal, which cannot fail to be interesting, published.\\" Similarly: \\"When I am dead, my life, which appears to me a remarkable one, will be read. (The only thing wanting is that it should have been different).\\" In effect, the first half of Bashkirtseff's journal is a coming-of-age story while the second is an account of heroic suffering. Bashkirtseff's journal was first published in 1887, and was only the second diary by a woman published in France to that date. It was an immediate success, not least because its cosmopolitan confessional style was a marked departure from the contemplative, mystical diaries of the writer Eug√©nie de Gu√©rin that had been published in 1862. An English translation appeared two years later under the title Marie Bashkirtseff: The Journal of a Young Artist 1860‚Äì1884. Translated by Mary J. Serrano, it was heavily abridged and bowdlerized, her relatives seeing to it that a good deal of material they considered unflattering to the family was removed. Self-portrait with a Palette, 1880 Marie Bashkirtseff - portrait of Mme X British Prime Minister William Gladstone referred to her journal as \\"a book without a parallel\\", and another early admirer was George Bernard Shaw. The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read the original French version over eight days in June 1890.Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.219-20. It remained popular, eventually spinning off both plays and movies based on her life story, including The Affairs of Maupassant, directed by Henry Koster and released in the United States in 1938. Her diary was cited as an inspiration by the American writer Mary MacLane, whose own shockingly confessional diary was written a bare generation later, and it was mentioned as a model by later writers who became known for their diaries, including Pierre Lou√øs, Katherine Mansfield, and Anais Nin. Her letters, consisting of her correspondence with the writer Guy de Maupassant (which she had begun under an assumed name) were first published in 1891. Until recently the accepted date of Bashkirtseff's birth was 11 November [23 November New Style], 1860. After the discovery of the original manuscript of Bashkirtseff's journal in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, however, it was found that her journal had been abridged and censored by her family in its first editions. Her date of birth (1858 not 1860) was falsified by her mother to make Bashkirtseff appear even more precocious. An unabridged edition of the complete journal, based on the original manuscript, has been published in French in 16 volumes, and excerpts from the years 1873‚Äì1876 have been translated into English under the title I Am the Most Interesting Book of All (see editions listed below).Marie Bashkirtseff's grave, Passy Cemetery, Paris Image:Bashkirtseva Autumn.jpgAutumn, 1883 Image:Bashkirtseff - The Meeting.jpgThe Meeting, 1884 Image:Marie Bashkirtseff - Der Regenschirm - 1883.jpegThe Umbrella, 1883 Image:Marie Bashkirtseff 2.jpgSpring, ca. 1884 Editions of the diary *The Journal of Marie Bashkirtseff: I Am the Most Interesting Book of All (Volume I) and Lust for Glory (Volume II).

Early life Natalia, or Natasha to her friends,Crawford and Crawford, p. 7 was the youngest of three daughters of a Moscow lawyer, Sergei Alexandrovich Sheremetevsky. She was born at a rented summer dacha at Perovo, on the outskirts of Moscow. Sheremetevsky employed 11 other lawyers, and was a member of the minor nobility, but had no title and was essentially a professional middle-class man.Crawford and Crawford, p. 36 He was a sometime deputy in the Moscow City Duma, and a trustee of the Arbat City School. In the first year of her life, Natalia and her family lived in a rented apartment near the Moscow Kremlin on Ilinka. Their landlord, wealthy industrialist Aleksey Khludov, was also Natalia's godfather. From 1881 to 1893, the family lived at 7 Serebriany Lane, a single-storied wooden house owned by Sheremetevsky. From 1893, the family lived in a succession of rented apartments until Natalia left home on her marriage. She was educated at a private school, and by a French governess employed by her father.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 36‚Äì37 First marriage In 1902, she married Sergei Mamontov (1 October 1877, Moscow ‚Äì 30 December 1939, Tallinn),Crawford and Crawford, p. 403 a nephew of Savva Mamontov. Sergei was a rehearsal accompanist for Savva Mamontov's Opera Company, which was renamed Association of Russian Opera after Savva's bankruptcy in 1899, and later at the Bolshoi Theatre. Through her first husband's connections, Natalia became friendly with noted musicians such as Sergei Rachmaninoff and Feodor Chaliapin.Crawford and Crawford, p. 35 The couple moved into 13 Mansurovsky Lane, a new apartment building near the fashionable Prechistenka street, and had a daughter, Natalia or \\"Tata\\" to the family, on 2 June 1903. Sergei had a stammer and was of a retiring disposition, but Natalia was keen to socialise. Finding him socially dull, she began to go out unaccompanied by her husband.Crawford and Crawford, p. 38 Russian divorce law followed the teachings of the Orthodox Church, and in practice divorce was only possible in cases of adultery where the husband was the guilty party.Crawford and Crawford, p. 33 In 1905, Sergei agreed to a divorce and to act in the proceedings as if he was the unfaithful partner. Now free from her first husband, Natalia married her lover, cavalry officer Vladimir Vladimirovich Wulfert ().Crawford and Crawford, p. 40 Second marriage Natalia between Wulfert (left) and Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia (right) Natalia and Wulfert had known each other as children, but only fell in love after re- meeting in Moscow when Wulfert was on leave.Crawford and Crawford, p. 39 He was an army officer serving in The Dowager Empress's Life Guard Cuirassier Regiment, known as the Blue Cuirassiers from the colour of their uniforms, stationed at Gatchina near Saint Petersburg.Crawford and Crawford, p. 41 Natalia and Wulfert set up home at 7 Baggout Street, Gatchina.Crawford and Crawford, p. 42 In early December 1907, Natalia was introduced to one of her husband's fellow officers in the Blue Cuirassiers: Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia, the brother of Tsar Nicholas II.Crawford and Crawford, p. 16 The following month, they met again at the Regimental Winter Ball.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 44‚Äì45 From then on, they began to see each other regularly,Crawford and Crawford, p. 46 though Michael was always careful to include Wulfert in his letters and invitations, at least until October 1908,Crawford and Crawford, p. 55 and use the formal form of \\"you\\" (vy) rather than the familiar one (ty).Crawford and Crawford, p. 49 Rumours of their affair spread through the regiment,Crawford and Crawford, p. 59 and Wulfert grew resentful. Michael began sending her secret letters to a separate postal address, now writing to her in familiar terms,Crawford and Crawford, p. 63 and Wulfert grew physically violent, as Natalia refused to share his bed.Crawford and Crawford, p. 66 In July 1909, privately in a letter, she accused her husband of rape.Letter from Natalia to Wulfert, 17 July 1909, State Archive of the Russian Federation, 622/23, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 66 She packed luggage, and with their daughter, an elderly female cousin, and two maids, she left Wulfert for a break abroad in Switzerland. Both Michael and Wulfert turned up at the train station to see her off, and Wulfert created a scene by loudly accusing her of ruining him. Through Baron Frederiks, the court minister, Michael tried to buy off Wulfert by offering him a post in Moscow as aide-de-camp to Prince Odoevsky-Maslov at the Kremlin.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 69‚Äì70 Wulfert threatened to commit suicide if Natalia did not return to him,Crawford and Crawford, p. 71 and then challenged Michael to a duel.Crawford and Crawford, p. 74 Nicholas II intervened, and transferred Michael from the Blue Cuirassiers to the Chernigov Hussars at Orel, from Saint Petersburg. In August 1909, Michael went to Denmark with his mother, and arranged for Natalia to meet him there. They were reunited in a hotel in Copenhagen, unbeknownst to his mother,Crawford and Crawford, p. 79 and consummated their relationship for the first time.Letter from Michael to Natalia, 29 October 1909, State Archive of the Russian Federation, 622/12, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, pp. 77, 89 Royal mistress Natalia and Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich with their son Wulfert accepted the Kremlin post, at an enlarged salary, and as Natalia's residence permit was tied to her husband's she also returned to Moscow to live temporarily at a hotel opposite the Kremlin.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 81‚Äì84 By November, she was living in an 8-room apartment at 36 Petersburg Road, paid for by Michael,Crawford and Crawford, pp. 85‚Äì87 where he visited her about 3 times a month from Orel.Letter from Michael to Nicholas II, 3 December 1909, State Archive of the Russian Federation, 601/1301, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 91 Wulfert was still demanding that Natalia return to him, as well as threatening to shoot her.Crawford and Crawford, p. 90 Against the wishes of Michael and Natalia, Nicholas II insisted that she remain in Moscow, and refused to vary the conditions of her residence permit.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 90‚Äì95 By December 1909, Natalia was pregnant. Fearful that her husband would try to claim the child and take it away from her, her desire for a divorce grew stronger.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 94‚Äì96 Eventually, after prolonged negotiations and a hefty pay-off, Wulfert agreed to a divorce on the pretence that he had been unfaithful.Crawford and Crawford, p. 97 Natalia's divorce petition was submitted to the Moscow Ecclesiastical Consistory Court on 19 February 1910, but by July 1910 it had not been granted. When she gave birth to a son on 24 July 1910, the child was legally Wulfert's. The boy was named George in honour of Michael's late brother.Crawford and Crawford, p. 104 It was said that Wulfert was bought off with a bribe of 200,000 roubles,Letter from Michael Bakhrushin to Pauline Gray, 17 December 1973, Leeds Russian Archive, MS 1363/136, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 107 and the date of their divorce was back-dated, so that George was recognised as Natalia's illegitimate son, though inheriting her noble status, rather than the legitimate child of Wulfert's.Crawford and Crawford, p. 107 In May 1911, Nicholas II granted Natalia the surname \\"Brasova\\" and the right to live at Michael's estate at Brasovo, from his posting at Orel. Michael, Natalia and her two children moved there immediately.Crawford and Crawford, p. 111 By the end of the year, Michael was posted to a command in Saint Petersburg, and they moved to the capital. He officially lived in regimental quarters while paying for a 28-room apartment at 16 Liteyny Prospekt for her.Crawford and Crawford, p. 118 She felt trapped in the apartment, feared that her letters were opened, and was ostracised by society.Crawford and Crawford, p. 119 After a few months, Michael moved her to a villa at 24 Nikolaevskaya, Gatchina, nearer to his base at the Gatchina Palace. Third marriage Knebworth House Just as they had done for the previous two years, in summer 1912, Michael and Natalia holidayed in Western Europe. After shaking off agents of Nicholas II's secret police, the Okhrana, Michael and Natalia married in Vienna on 16 October 1912 in a Serbian Orthodox Church.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 125‚Äì126 They had successfully planned the wedding without either Nicholas II's or the Okhrana's knowledge.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 126‚Äì128 On their eventual arrival in Cannes, after a few days travelling through Venice and Milan, Natalia's two children joined them from Russia.Crawford and Crawford, p. 128 The Grand Duke wrote to his brother, the Tsar, to inform him of the marriage, but because Natalia was divorced and not of royal blood the Tsar refused to approve it.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 129‚Äì131 Michael was perceived by the court as being \\"under the hypnotic influence of a malicious vamp\\".Memorandum in the State Archive of the Russian Federation, 601/1301 f. 175‚Äì6, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 133 Nicholas II said Natalia was \\"such a cunning, wicked beast that it's disgusting even to talk about her\\".Letter from Nicholas II to Empress Marie, 21 November 1912, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 133 Michael was removed from the imperial succession, and exiled from Russia in disgrace. Though members of society felt some sympathy for Michael, thinking his punishment severe, there was little sympathy for Natalia.Crawford and Crawford, p. 137 Despite marrying a Grand Duke, she was not entitled to be known as \\"Grand Duchess\\", and instead used the style \\"Madame or Countess Brasova\\".Crawford and Crawford, pp. 151‚Äì152, 410 (note 17), and 213 Until September 1913, they stayed in hotels throughout Europe, without any decrease in their standard of living. They met Michael's sister Grand Duchess Xenia and cousin Grand Duke Andrew,Crawford and Crawford, pp. 138‚Äì145 and in July 1913, they saw Michael's mother in London who told Natalia \\"a few home truths\\" according to Xenia's diary.Quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 146 From September 1913, they leased an English country house, Knebworth, north of London.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 148‚Äì149 Natalia acted as hostess for any of their guests, which included her friend Chaliapin, the Ballets Russes, and the artist Serge Sudeikin.Crawford and Crawford, p. 154 As a divorc√©e, however, Natalia was often excluded from invitations to social events elsewhere; the divorced were not received at court and could not enter the Royal Enclosure at Ascot.Crawford and Crawford, p. 155 War Natalia and Grand Duke Michael Upon the outbreak of World War I, Michael requested Nicholas II's permission to return home and to the army, with the understanding his wife and children could accompany him. Nicholas agreed and the family returned to the house on Nikolaevskaya street; Natalia was still not permitted to live in any of the imperial palaces.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 159‚Äì161 Michael was appointed to the rank of major-general, and given command of the Savage Division (–î–∏–∫–∞—è –î–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è) formed from Chechens and Daghestani. The post was perceived as a relatively low position in the Army, and was believed to be Nicholas II's punishment for Michael's marriage.Crawford and Crawford, p. 162 As was expected of women in the imperial family, Natalia founded two hospitals, one at Gatchina and one at Saint Petersburg, in properties owned by Michael.Crawford and Crawford, p. 166 In January 1915, her sister Olga died in Moscow, and she went there for the funeral. At her hotel in Moscow, she was visited by Michael's cousin, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, who professed himself in love with her.Crawford and Crawford, p. 173‚Äì175 Dmitri had a reputation as a rake,Crawford and Crawford, p. 168 and Natalia, though flattered, turned him down and told her husband of the encounter.Crawford and Crawford, p. 174‚Äì175 Just eight weeks later, her eldest sister Vera also died.Crawford and Crawford, p. 181 In March 1915, Nicholas II agreed to legitimise George, and grant him the style of Count Brasov, although George still held no claim to the throne.Crawford and Crawford, p. 182 Natalia's social circle expanded as more people began to accept her.Crawford and Crawford, p. 183 As the war began to go badly for the Russians, Natalia was dismayed by the change in Michael's appearance as he abandoned his smart uniforms and decorations and wore a plain uniform with his muddy boots.Crawford and Crawford, p. 189 Michael was \\"deeply upset\\" by Natalia's criticisms of his decision to be in the frontline of the war.Letter from Michael to Natalia, 10 June 1915, State Archive of the Russian Federation, 622/20, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 189 He wrote to her, \\"the present time is so hard for Russia that my conscience could not allow me not to join the frontline service ‚Äì and I am convinced that having done that, I also brought you some good in terms of public opinion, which, unfortunately, we can't totally ignore.\\"Letter from Michael to Natalia, 20 June 1915, State Archive of the Russian Federation, 622/20, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 191 Natalia's social circle widened to include deputies in the Duma, and she was perceived as a liberal who supported a constitutional monarchy rather than the Tsar's autocracy.Crawford and Crawford, p. 215 The Tsarina, Alexandra, even feared that Natalia was conspiring to make Michael Emperor.Alexandra's diary, 21 February 1917, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 220 The Tsarina and Dowager Empress still would not accept Natalia. A portrait of her in a Kiev hospital she had funded with her own money was hidden by hospital staff for a visit by the Dowager Empress,Crawford and Crawford, p. 222 and Alexandra had an exhibition of photographs of Michael and Natalia cleared by the imperial police.Crawford and Crawford, p. 223 Natalia was depressed by the snubs, and by her separation from Michael, who was still at the front.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 231‚Äì233 In September 1916, they reunited at Mogilev, and spent time at Brasovo and Gatchina for the next six weeks, until Michael fell ill with stomach ulcers. They moved to the Crimea for Michael's recuperation.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 234‚Äì235 Christmas 1916 was spent at Brasovo as a family, where Natalia's daughter was \\"thrilled to the core\\" to hear that Dimitri had helped murder Rasputin, Tsarina Alexandra's self-styled spiritual mentor.Natalia Mamontova's Memoirs Stepdaughter to Imperial Russia (London: 1940), p. 90, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 245 Revolution After the February Revolution in 1917, Nicholas abdicated in Michael's favour, but Michael refused to accept the throne until ratified by the will of the people. By naming Michael as his successor, Nicholas effectively reversed the long-standing law that morganatically married dynasts forfeited rights of succession, but his actions were ultimately irrelevant. Power lay with the revolutionaries, not with the Tsar, whether it was Nicholas or Michael.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 315‚Äì319 Michael and his family were placed under house arrest in Gatchina.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 327‚Äì330 In September 1917, the house arrest was lifted.Crawford and Crawford, p. 332 At the end of the following month the Prime Minister, Alexander Kerensky, was deposed in the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks seized power. With a permit to travel issued by Peter Polotsov, a former army colleague of Michael's who held a command in Saint Petersburg, the family planned to move to the greater safety of Finland.Crawford and Crawford, p. 334 Valuables were packed and the children were moved to an estate south of Gatchina owned by Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, the brother of one of Natalia's closest friends (Nadine Vonlyarlarskaya) and the father of the famous writer, Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov. The Bolsheviks discovered their plan, however, and their escape was blocked.Crawford and Crawford, p. 335 The children returned to Gatchina, and they were once again under house arrest.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 335‚Äì336 Natalia managed to gain access to her safety deposit box, by claiming that she needed to examine some papers at the bank, and thus retrieved as much of her jewellery as she could conceal without arousing suspicion.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 336‚Äì337 The house arrest was lifted in November, but on 7 March 1918 Michael and Nicholas Johnson‚Äîwho had been his secretary since December 1912Crawford and Crawford, p. 141‚Äîwere re-arrested on the orders of Moisei Uritsky, the Head of the Petrograd secret police. They were imprisoned at Bolshevik headquarters in the Smolny Institute.Crawford and Crawford, p. 339 Natalia visited Michael the next two days, 8 and 9 March 1918, with their friend Princess Putyatina. On 9 March, she barged her way into Lenin's office, which was in the same building, to remonstrate with him.Poutiatine, Princesse Olga (November 1923), \\"Les Derniers Jours du Grand-Duc Michel Alexandrovich\\", Revue de Deux Mondes, Paris, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 339 In the evening, the Council of the People's Commissars decided to send Michael and Johnson into internal exile. On 11 March, they were sent a thousand miles eastwards to the remote city of Perm.Crawford and Crawford, p. 340 Concerned for her entire family's safety, Natalia made plans for the children to be taken abroad. With the help of the Danish embassy, which was next-door to Princess Puyatina's apartment, George was smuggled out of the country to Denmark by his nanny, Miss Neame.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 344-345 The Danes extended diplomatic protection to the villa in Gatchina by pretending to rent it and flying the Danish flag over the house. Natalia wanted to join Michael in Perm, and after repeated pleading received a travel permit to join him.Crawford and Crawford, p. 346 They spent about a week together, until an army of disgruntled Czechs advanced on Perm.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 347‚Äì348 The Bolsheviks had attempted to ship prisoners-of-war from Austria‚ÄìHungary out of Russia, ethnic Czech troops amongst them. The Czechs, however, were not going home to fight once more for the Austrian empire, but to fight for a separate independent homeland. The Germans demanded that the Bolsheviks disarm the Czechs, with the result that the Czech forces joined with the White Army, fighting against the Bolsheviks.Massie, p. 13 With the approach of the Czechs, Michael and Natalia feared that she would become trapped in Perm, possibly in a dangerous situation, and so on 18 May she left for Moscow.Crawford and Crawford, p. 348 In Moscow, Natalia continued to badger Bolshevik Commissars, including Lenin, Trotsky and Sverdlov, for Michael's release, but to no avail.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 348‚Äì349 In June 1918, her husband and Johnson were shot by their captors on the outskirts of Perm. To cover their tracks, the Perm authorities distributed a concocted story that Michael was abducted by unidentified men and had disappeared.Crawford and Crawford, p. 361 Natalia went to Uritsky in a quest for an explanation, but Uritsky ordered her arrest and incarceration.Crawford and Crawford, p. 364 The Soviet disinformation about Michael's disappearance led to unfounded rumours that he had escaped and was leading a successful counter-revolution. Natalia heard the rumours in prison, and chose to believe them.Crawford and Crawford, p. 365 Ten weeks after her imprisonment, in early September, Natalia pretended that she had developed tuberculosis, and was moved to a nursing home. Once there, she escaped and took refuge in the apartment above her brother-in-law's with family friend Princess Vyazemskaya.Crawford and Crawford, p. 372 Uritsky had been murdered in late August, and the Bolsheviks were terrorising Petrograd in what was later called the Red Terror. Natalia's daughter, \\"Tata\\", was arrested and imprisoned, but released after a few days when it became apparent she had no knowledge of her mother's whereabouts.Crawford and Crawford, p. 371 With no money or food, \\"Tata\\" made her way to her uncle's apartment, and so was fortuitously re-united with her mother.Natalia Mamontova's Memoirs, pp. 158‚Äì160, quoted in Crawford and Crawford, p. 371 Exile The Germans believed the widespread rumours that Michael was still alive, and plotted to rescue Natalia from Russia in an attempt to gain influence with Michael.Crawford and Crawford, p. 374 Through the German-controlled Ukrainian consulate, Natalia and her daughter were provided with false passports. Natalia's daughter used her own name, while Natalia's passport was in the name of a nun called Frau Tania Klenow.Crawford and Crawford, p. 375 They travelled separately to Kiev, with Natalia disguised as a nun. They were still in Kiev when the war ended with Germany's defeat on 11 November 1918.Crawford and Crawford, p. 377 German authority began to collapse. Natalia and her daughter, along with Princess Vyazemskaya and Natalia's widowed brother-in-law Aleksei Matveev, who had both made it to Kiev as well, fled to Odessa in the hope they could escape by sea. Two British naval vessels at the port, HMS Nereide and HMS Skirmisher, provided them with sanctuary. Aboard HMS Nereide they were evacuated to Constantinople.Crawford and Crawford, p. 378 By way of HMS Agamemnon to Malta, merchant ship to Marseilles, and rail to Paris, Natalia arrived in England. Johnson's widowed mother had leased a house, Snape in Wadhurst, Sussex, for Michael's family, and all the furniture and furnishings stored at Paddockhurst were moved in. George arrived from Copenhagen with his nanny in spring 1919,Crawford and Crawford, p. 381 and was sent to an English boarding school. Natalia's daughter, Natalia Mamontova, was enrolled at a convent school in France. For funds, Natalia used money in Michael's bank accounts in Paris and Copenhagen, and started selling her jewellery.Crawford and Crawford, p. 382 She met Michael's mother, the Dowager Empress Marie, who had also escaped Russia, in London, and their meeting this time was courteous.Crawford and Crawford, p. 383 Conflicting rumours about Michael's fate and whereabouts continued without any solid news.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 383‚Äì384 In 1920, \\"Tata\\" was sent to Cheltenham Ladies' College and George was enrolled at Harrow School. Natalia moved out of Snape as the lease ended, and moved to Percy Lodge near Richmond, Surrey. On 12 August 1921, 18-year-old Natalia Mamontova married future BBC broadcaster Val Gielgud, against her mother's wishes and without her foreknowledge.Crawford and Crawford, p. 385 Natalia Mamontova was on school break and returned home as if nothing had happened. When Natalia found out, she ordered her daughter out of her house. Natalia left Percy Lodge and moved into an apartment in Kensington.Crawford and Crawford, p. 386 The Gielguds divorced in 1923, and Natalia Mamontova married composer and music critic Cecil Gray.Crawford and Crawford, p. 392 By 1924, there was still no sign of Michael, and Natalia had him declared legally dead on 5 July 1924. She inherited his estate in Britain, which was valued at a mere ¬£95.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 386‚Äì387 The following month, Michael's cousin, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich, declared himself Emperor on the basis that he had inherited the throne at the moment of the previous Emperor's death, despite the abolition of the Russian monarchy by the communists.Crawford and Crawford, p. 387 In 1928, he gave Natalia the title of Princess, followed in 1935 by the style \\"Her Serene Highness Princess Romanovskaya-Brasova\\". He made George a Prince. Cyril's claim to the throne was met with opposition from within the Romanov family because at his birth his mother was a Lutheran and not a member of the Russian Orthodox Church.Crawford and Crawford, p. 389; Massie, p. 265 Furthermore, Cyril had married Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who was a divorc√©e and his first cousin, without the Emperor's consent.Crawford and Crawford, p. 389; Massie, p. 266 The House law that determined the Russian line of succession excluded princes born to non-Orthodox mothers, and princes who married without the Tsar's consent.Crawford and Crawford, p. 389; Massie, pp. 265‚Äì266 The Russian Orthodox Church did not recognise Victoria's divorce from her first husband as valid, and did not permit marriage between first cousins. Cyril's title, and by extension Natalia's and George's, were only recognised by Cyril's supporters.Crawford and Crawford, p. 389 Decline Her grave in cimeti√®re de Passy in Paris. To save money, in 1927 Natalia moved to Paris where living costs were less than in London.Crawford and Crawford, p. 390 George joined her in France, but he was killed after a car accident in 1931. She was at his bedside when he died, though he had not regained consciousness after the crash. She was emotionally devastated.Crawford and Crawford, p. 391 Natalia's granddaughter, Pauline Gray, was born in 1929, but the Grays' marriage also ended in divorce. Natalia Mamontova's third and last marriage was to naval officer Michael Majolier, with whom she had a second daughter, Alexandra, born in 1934. Natalia continued attempts to recover Michael's assets. The Polish government had seized Michael's Polish estate, and Natalia sued them for its return or compensation. By the Peace of Riga, the Poles were entitled to any imperial property in the former Russian Poland, but Natalia pointed out that Michael was already dead before the Peace, and so any of Michael's property in Poland was legally hers, as a commoner. In 1937, the court ruled against her. In 1938, she did receive a pay-out from the German courts, when the Tsar's estate in Germany was shared between all his heirs, but hyper-inflation had reduced its value.Crawford and Crawford, p. 393 She continued to sell anything she could in a desperate attempt to raise cash.Crawford and Crawford, pp. 393‚Äì394 During World War II, Natalia and her daughter were separated as Natalia lived in Paris, and her daughter was in Britain. They were unable to communicate with each other until after the war, by which time Natalia was penniless and lived as a refugee in an attic box- room.Crawford and Crawford, p. 394 On 23 January 1952, she died of cancer at the La√´nnec charity hospital in Paris in complete poverty, and was buried in Passy Cemetery (Section 9, near the intersection with the outer wall and Section 8) in Paris beside her son George, Count Brasov.Crawford and Crawford, p. 395 Notes References * Crawford, Rosemary; Crawford, Donald (1997), Michael and Natasha: The Life and Love of the Last Tsar of Russia, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, * Massie, Robert K.

Note the DE-9 connector, cryptic mode switch, contrast and brightness controls at front, and the V-Size and V-Hold knobs at rear, which allow the control of the scaling and signal to CRT refresh-rate synchronization respectively. Various computer display standards or display modes have been used in the history of the personal computer. They are often a combination of aspect ratio (specified as width-to-height ratio), display resolution (specified as the width and height in pixels), color depth (measured in bits per pixel), and refresh rate (expressed in hertz). Associated with the screen resolution and refresh rate is a display adapter. Earlier display adapters were simple frame-buffers, but later display standards also specified a more extensive set of display functions and software controlled interface. Beyond display modes, the VESA industry organization has defined several standards related to power management and device identification, while ergonomics standards are set by the TCO. Standards A number of common resolutions have been used with computers descended from the original IBM PC. Some of these are now supported by other families of personal computers. These are de facto standards, usually originated by one manufacturer and reverse-engineered by others, though the VESA group has co-ordinated the efforts of several leading video display adapter manufacturers. Video standards associated with IBM-PC-descended personal computers are shown in the diagram and table below, alongside those of early Macintosh and other makes for comparison. (From the early 1990s onwards, most manufacturers moved over to PC display standards thanks to widely available and affordable hardware). Comparison of video resolutions. The curved lines show the thresholds for resolutions with at least 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 million pixels. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" +Table of computer display standards - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !Video standard !Full name !Description !data-sort-type=\\"number\\"Display resolution (pixels) !Width (px) !Height (px) !Area (px) !Aspect ratio !Color depth (2^bpp colors) - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !QQVGA Quarter Quarter Video Graphics Array Used on some portable devices, and is a common alternative resolution to QCIF for webcams and other online video streams in low-bandwidth situations, and on video modes of early and later low-end digital cameras. 160√ó120 (19k) 160 120 19,200 4:3 - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !UNNAMED UNNAMED A common size for LCDs manufactured for small consumer electronics, basic mobile phones and feature phones, typically in a 1.7\\" to 1.9\\" diagonal size. This LCD is often used in portrait (128√ó160) orientation. The unusual 5:4 aspect ratio makes the display slightly different from QQVGA dimensions. 160√ó128 (20k) 160 128 20,480 5:4 - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !UNNAMED UNNAMED A shared size for older portable video game systems.

Colour depth ranged from 4 colours (2 bpp) with the original Game Boy, through 16‚Äì32 colours (4‚Äì5 bpp) with the Atari Lynx and Game Gear, to a maximum of 56 colours (equivalent of 6 bpp) from a wider palette with the Game Boy Color.

First appeared as a VESA mode (134h=256 color, 135h=Hi-Color) that primarily allowed 80x30 character text with graphics, and should not be confused with CGA (320x200); QVGA is normally used when describing screens on portable devices (PDAs, pocket media players, feature phones, smartphones, etc.). No set colour depth or refresh rate is associated with this standard or those that follow, as it is dependent both on the manufacturing quality of the screen and the capabilities of the attached display driver hardware, and almost always incorporates an LCD panel with no visible line-scanning. However, it would typically be in the 8-to-12 bpp (256‚Äì4096 colours) through 18 bpp (262,144 colours) range. 320√ó240 (77k) 320 240 76,800 4:3 - style=\\"vertical- align: top;\\" !WQVGA later models (TT, later models (TT, later models (TT, Wide Quarter Video Graphics Array Effectively 1/16 the total resolution (1/4 in each dimension) of \\"Full HD\\", but with the height aligned to an 8-pixel \\"macroblock\\" boundary.

They used televisions for display output and had a typical usable screen resolution from 102‚Äì320 pixels wide and usually 192‚Äì256 lines high, in non-interlaced (NI) mode for a more stable image (displaying a full image on each 1/50th / 1/60th-second field, instead of splitting it across each frame). The limited resolution led to displays with a characteristic wide overscan border around the active area. Some more powerful machines were able to display higher horizontal resolutions‚Äîeither in text-mode alone or in low- colour bitmap graphics, and typically by halving the width of each pixel, rather than physically expanding the display area‚Äîbut were still confined in the vertical dimension by the relatively slow horizontal scanning rate of a domestic TV set. These same standards‚Äîalbeit with progressively greater colour depth and upstream graphical processing ability‚Äîwould see extended use and popularity in TV-connected game consoles right through to the end of the 20th century. 140√ó192 NI (low-end), 320√ó200 NI (typical), 640√ó256 NI (high-end)  4:3 (non-square pixels) 1‚Äì4 bpp typical, 2 or 3 bpp common. - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" !ST Low/Med Resolution Atari ST (etc.) Colour, Broadcast-standard Atari ST line.

High resolution monochrome mode using a custom non-interlaced monitor with the slightly lower vertical resolution (in order to be an integer multiple of low and medium resolution and thus utilize the same amount of RAM for the framebuffer) allowing a \\"flicker free\\" 71.25 Hz refresh rate, higher even than the highest refresh rate provided by VGA. All machines in the ST series could also use colour or monochrome VGA monitors with a proper cable or physical adapter, and all but the TT could display 640x400 at 71.25 Hz on VGA monitors. 640√ó400  256,000 4:3 (or 16:10 with square pixels) 1 bpp for ST, on the Falcon: 1-8 bpp grayscale on the ST monochrome monitor, and 8 bpp colour on VGA/multisync monitors. - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" !TT High Resolution Atari TT (etc.) Monochrome, proprietary standard Atari TT line.

They used NTSC or PAL-compliant televisions and monochrome, composite video or RGB-component monitors. The interlaced (i or I) mode produced visible flickering of finer details, eventually fixable by use of scan doubler devices and VGA monitors. 720√ó480i/576i maximum. Typically 640√ó400i/512i or 640√ó200/256 NI, and 320√ó200/256 NI for games.  4:3 (non-square pixels) Up to 6 bpp for Amiga (8 bpp with later models), typically 2‚Äì4 bpp for most hi-res applications (saving memory and processing time), 4‚Äì5 bpp for games and \\"fake\\" 12/18 bpp for static images (HAM mode). Up to 15 bpp for Archimedes and Falcon (12 bpp for TT), but typically 4 bpp in use. - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" !Mac Mono 9\\" Original Apple Macintosh display The single fixed-screen mode used in first-generation (128k and 512k) Apple Mac computers, launched in 1984, with a monochrome 9\\" CRT integrated into the body of the computer. Used to display one of the first mass-market full-time GUIs, and one of the earliest non-interlaced default displays with more than 256 lines of vertical resolution. (Early models used a 384√ó256 screen; both standards are cut down from the 720√ó364 of the preceding Lisa model) 512√ó342 (175k)  175,104 Very nearly 3:2 (to within 0.2%); 256:171 exact. Displayed with square pixels on a moderately wide-screen monitor (equivalent to 16:10.67 in modern terms). 1 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" !Mac Colour Apple Mac II and later models The second-generation Macintosh, launched in 1987, came with colour (and greyscale) capability as standard, at two levels, depending on monitor size‚Äî512√ó384 (1/4 of the later XGA standard) on a 12\\" (4:3) colour or greyscale (monochrome) monitor; 640√ó480 with a larger (13\\" or 14\\") high- resolution monitor (superficially similar to VGA, but at a higher 67 Hz refresh rate)‚Äîwith 8-bit colour/256 grey shades at the lower resolution, and either 4-bit or 8-bit colour (16/256 grey) in high resolution depending on installed memory (256 or 512 kB), all out of a full 24-bit master palette. The result was equivalent to VGA or even PGC‚Äîbut with a wide palette‚Äîat a point simultaneous with the IBM launch of VGA. Later, larger monitors (15\\" and 16\\") allowed use of an SVGA-like binary-half-megapixel 832√ó624 resolution (at 75 Hz) that was eventually used as the default setting for the original, late-1990s iMac. Even larger 17\\" and 19\\" monitors could attain higher resolutions still, when connected to a suitably capable computer, but apart from the 1152√ó870 \\"XGA+\\" mode discussed further below, Mac resolutions beyond 832√ó624 tended to fall into line with PC standards, using what were essentially rebadged PC monitors with a different cable connection. Mac models after the II (Power Mac, Quadra, etc.) also allowed at first 16-bit High Colour (65,536, or \\"Thousands of\\" colours), and then 24-bit True Colour (16.7M, or \\"Millions of\\" colours), but much like PC standards beyond XGA, the increase in colour depth past 8 bpp was not strictly tied to changing resolution standards. 512√ó384 (197k), 640√ó480 (307k), 832√ó624 (519k)  4:3 4 bpp, 8 bpp, and later 16/24 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" !PowerBook internal panel PowerBook, early generations The first PowerBook, released in 1991, replaced the original Mac Portable (basically an original Mac with an LCD, keyboard and trackball in a lunchbox-style shell), and introduced a new 640√ó400 greyscale screen. This was joined in 1993 with the PowerBook 165c, which kept the same resolution but added colour capability similar to that of Mac II (256 colours from a palette of 16.7 million). 640√ó400 (256k)  256,000 16:10 / 8:5 (square pixels) 8 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !MDA Monochrome Display Adapter The original standard on IBM PCs and IBM PC XTs with 4 kB video RAM. Introduced in 1981 by IBM. Supports text mode only. 720√ó350 (252k)  252,000 72:35 (effectively 4:3 (non-square pixels) on CRTs but could be a variety of aspects on LCDs) 1 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !CGA Color Graphics Adapter Introduced in 1981 by IBM, as the first colour display standard for the IBM PC. The standard CGA graphics cards were equipped with 16 kB video RAM. 640√ó200 (128k) 320√ó200 (64k) 160√ó200 (32k)  16:5 16:10/8:5 4:5 (effectively 4:3 on CRTs; various aspects on LCDs) 1 bpp 2 bpp 4 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !Hercules A monochrome display capable of sharp text and graphics for its time. Very popular with the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet application, which was one of PC's first killer apps. Introduced in 1982. 720√ó348 (251k)  250,560 60:29 (effectively 4:3) 1 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" !Orchid Graphics Adapter A monochrome display that expanded Monochrome Display Adapter's capabilities with graphics. Introduced in 1982. 720√ó350  252,000 60:29 (effectively 4:3) 1 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !EGA Enhanced Graphics Adapter Introduced in 1984 by IBM. A resolution of 640√ó350 pixels of 16 different colours in 4 bits per pixel (bpp), selectable from a 64-colour palette in 2 bits per each of red-green-blue (RGB) unit. Other commonly used modes were the existing CGA 320√ó200 and 640√ó200 resolutions in 4 bpp, with a fixed palette corresponding to the 16 colours available in CGA text mode, allowing an EGA card to be used in full colour with an unmodified CGA monitor by setting the correct DIP switch options; plus full EGA resolution (and CGA hi-res) in monochrome, if installed memory was insufficient for full colour at above 320√ó200. 640√ó350 (224k), 640√ó200 (128k), 320√ó200 (64k)  64:35, 16:5 and 16:10/8:5 (all effectively 4:3) 4 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !Professional Graphics Controller With on-board 2D and 3D acceleration introduced in 1984 for the 8-bit PC-bus, intended for CAD applications, a triple-board display adapter with built-in processor, and displaying high-resolution, full-colour graphics at a 60 Hz frame rate. 640√ó480 (307k)  307,200 4:3 8 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !MCGA Multi-Color Graphics Array Introduced by IBM on ISA-based PS/2 models in 1987, with reduced cost compared to VGA. MCGA had a 320√ó200 256-colour (from a 262,144 colour palette) mode, and a 640√ó480 mode only in monochrome due to 64k video memory, compared to the 256k memory of VGA. 320√ó200 (64k) 640√ó480 (307k)  16:10 (effectively 4:3) 4:3 (square pixels) 8 bpp 1 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" !VGA Video Graphics Array Introduced on MCA-based PS/2 models in 1987, it replaced the digital TTL signaling of EGA and earlier standards with analog RGBHV signaling, using the synonymous VGA connector. As with EGA, the VGA standard actually encompasses a set of different resolutions; 640√ó480 is sometimes referred to as \\"VGA resolution\\" today, however as per the original standard this mode actually only supports 16 colours (4 bpp) at 60 Hz. Other common display modes also defined as VGA include 320√ó200 at 256 colours (8 bpp) (standard VGA resolution for DOS games that stems from halving the pixel rate of 640√ó400, but doubling color depth) and a text mode with 720√ó400 pixels; these modes run at 70 Hz and use non- square pixels, so 4:3 aspect correction is required for correct display. Furthermore, VGA displays and adapters are generally capable of Mode X graphics, an undocumented mode to allow increased non-standard resolutions, most commonly 320√ó240 (with 8 bpp and square pixels) at 60 Hz. VGA, like the majority of the following standards, was capable of displaying most standard modes featured by IBM-compatible PCs‚ÄîCGA, EGA, MDA and MCGA‚Äîbut typically not Hercules or PGA/PGC. 640√ó480 (307k) (hi-res graphics and LCD text) 720√ó400 (CRT text; 288k equivalent) 320√ó200 (64k), 320√ó240 (75k)  4:3 9:5 (non-square PAR 4:3) 16:10 (non-square PAR 4:3) 4 bpp 4 bpp 8 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" !8514 Precursor to XGA and released shortly after VGA in 1987. 8514/A cards displayed interlaced video at 43.5 Hz in a 1024√ó768 resolution, and at 640√ó480, 60 Hz non-interlaced, both with up to 256 colours. The high-resolution mode introduced by 8514/A became a de facto general standard in a succession of computing and digital-media fields for more than two decades, arguably more so than SVGA, with successive IBM and clone videocards and CRT monitors (a multisync monitor's grade being broadly determinable by whether it could display 1024√ó768 at all, or show it interlaced, non-interlaced, or \\"flicker-free\\"), LCD panels (the standard resolution for 14\\" and 15\\" 4:3 desktop monitors, and a whole generation of 11‚Äì15\\" laptops), early plasma and HD ready LCD televisions (albeit at a stretched 16:9 aspect ratio, showing down-scaled material), professional video projectors, and most recently, tablet computers. 1024√ó768 (786k), 640√ó480 (307k)  4:3 8 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" !SVGA Super Video Graphics Array An extension to VGA defined by VESA for IBM PC-compatible computers in 1989 meant to take advantage of video cards that exceeded the minimum 256 kB defined in the VGA standard. For instance, one of the early supported modes was 800√ó600 in 16 colours at a slightly lower 56 Hz refresh rate, leading to 800√ó600 sometimes being referred to as \\"SVGA resolution\\" today. Over the course of the early-to-mid-1990s, \\"SVGA\\" became a quasi- standard term in PC games, typically referring to a 640√ó480 resolution using 256 colours (8 bpp) at 60 Hz refresh rate. Many other higher and lower modes were standardized in the VESA BIOS Extensions, leading to the establishment of \\"SVGA\\" and \\"VESA\\" as catch-all terms encompassing output modes that surpassed the original VGA specifications. 800√ó600 (480k) 640√ó480 (307k)  480,000 4:3 4 bpp 8 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" !XGA Extended Graphics Array An IBM display standard introduced in 1990. XGA built on 8514/A's existing 1024√ó768 mode and added support for \\"high colour\\" (65,536 colours, 16 bpp) at 640√ó480. The second revision (\\"XGA-2\\") was a more thorough upgrade, offering higher refresh rates (75 Hz and up, non-interlaced, up to at least 1024√ó768), improved performance, and a fully programmable display engine capable of almost any resolution within its physical limits. For example, 1280√ó1024 (5:4) or 1360√ó1024 (4:3) in 16 colours at 60 Hz, 1056√ó400 [14h] Text Mode (132√ó50 characters); 800√ó600 in 256 or 64k colours; and even as high as 1600√ó1200 (at a reduced 50 Hz scan rate) with a high-quality multisync monitor (or an otherwise non-standard 960√ó720 at 60 Hz on a lower-end one capable of high refresh rates at 800√ó600, but only interlaced mode at 1024√ó768). However, the extended modes required custom drivers, and so only the basic options (1024√ó768√ó8 I, 640√ó480√ó16 NI, high-res text) were commonly used outside Windows and other hardware-abstracting graphical environments. 1024√ó768 (786k) 640√ó480 (307k), 1056√ó400 (text, 422k equivalent)  4:3 4:3, 66:25 (effectively 4:3) 8 bpp 16 bpp - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\" !XGA+ Extended Graphics Array Plus Although not an official name, this term is now used to refer to 1152√ó864, which is the largest 4:3 array yielding less than a binary megapixel (2^20, 1048576 pixels, 1048 decimal kilopixels), thus allowing the greatest \\"normal\\" resolution at common colour depths with a standard amount of video memory (128 kB, 512 kB, 1 MB, 2 MB, etc.).

E.g. QVGA, a term for a 320√ó240 resolution, half the width and height of VGA, hence the quarter total resolution. The \\"Q\\" prefix usually indicates \\"Quad\\" (4 times as many, not 1/4 times as many) in higher resolutions, and sometimes \\"q\\" is used instead of \\"Q\\" to specify quarter (by analogy with SI prefixes m/M), but this usage is not consistent. ;Wide (W) :The base resolution increased by increasing the width and keeping the height constant, for square or near-square pixels on a widescreen display, usually with an aspect ratio of either 16:9 (adding an extra 1/3rd width vs a standard 4:3 display) or 16:10 (adding an extra 1/5th). However, it is sometimes used to denote a resolution that would have roughly the same total pixel count as this, but in a different aspect and sharing neither the horizontal OR vertical resolution‚Äîtypically for a 16:10 resolution which is narrower but taller than the 16:9 option, and therefore larger in both dimensions than the base standard (e.g., compare 1366√ó768 and 1280√ó800, both commonly labelled as \\"WXGA\\", vs the base 1024√ó768 \\"XGA\\"). ;Quad(ruple) (Q) :Four times as many pixels compared to the base resolution, i.e. twice the horizontal and vertical resolution respectively. ;Hex(adecatuple) (H) :Sixteen times as many pixels compared to the base resolution, i.e. four times the horizontal and vertical resolutions respectively. ;Super (S), eXtended (X), Plus (+) and/or Ultra (U) :Vaguer terms denoting successive incremental steps up the resolution ladder from some comparative, more established base, usually somewhat less severe a jump than quartering or Quadrupling‚Äîtypically less than doubling, and sometimes not even as much of a change as making a \\"wide\\" version; for example SVGA (800√ó600 vs 640√ó480), SXGA (1280√ó1024 vs 1024√ó768), SXGA+ (1400√ó1050 vs 1280√ó1024) and UXGA (1600√ó1200 vs 1024√ó768 - or more fittingly, vs the 1280√ó1024 of SXGA, the conceptual \\"next step down\\" at the time of UXGA's inception, or the 1400√ó1050 of SXGA+). Given the use of \\"X\\" in \\"XGA\\", it is not often used as an additional modifier (e.g. there is no such thing as XVGA except as an alternative designation for SXGA) unless its meaning would be unambiguous. These prefixes are also often combined, as in WQXGA or WHUXGA, with levels of stacking not hindered by the same consideration towards readability as the decline of the added \\"X\\" - especially as there is not even a defined hierarchy or value for S/X/U/+ modifiers.

The term can now refer either to the computer display standard, the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector, or the 640√ó480 resolution characteristic of the VGA hardware. VGA was the last IBM graphics standard to which the majority of PC clone manufacturers conformed, making it the lowest common denominator that virtually all post-1990 PC graphics hardware can be expected to implement. IBM intended to supersede VGA with the Extended Graphics Array (XGA) standard, but failed. Instead, VGA was adapted into many extended forms by third parties, collectively known as Super VGA, then gave way to custom graphics processing units which, in addition to their proprietary interfaces and capabilities, continue to implement common VGA graphics modes and interfaces to the present day. The VGA analog interface standard has been extended to support high- definition video, up to resolutions of at least 1080p.  Hardware design  IBM PS/55 alt=left Unlike the graphics adapters that preceded it (MDA, CGA, EGA and many third-party options) there was initially no discrete VGA card released by IBM. The first commercial implementation of VGA was a built-in component of the IBM PS/2, in which it was accompanied by 256KB of video RAM, and a new DE-15 connector replacing the DE-9 used by previous graphics adapters. IBM later released the standalone IBM PS/2 Display Adapter, which utilized the VGA but could be added to machines that did not have it built in. The VGA was a single chip implementing the entirety of a video display controller, rather than the many discrete components and ICs of the graphics adapters that had preceded it. The term \\"array\\" rather than \\"adapter\\" in the name denoted that it was not a complete independent expansion device, but a single component that could be integrated into a system. The VGA required only video memory, timing crystals and an external RAMDAC, and its small part count allowed IBM to include it directly on the PS/2 motherboard, in contrast to prior IBM PC modelsPC, PC/XT, and PC ATwhich required a separate display adapter installed in a slot in order to connect a monitor. Capabilities left The VGA supports all graphics modes supported by the MDA, CGA and EGA cards, as well as multiple new modes. =Standard graphics modes= *640√ó480 in 16 colors or monochrome *640√ó350 or 640√ó200 in 16 colors or monochrome (EGA compatibility) *320√ó200 in 256 colors (Mode 13h) *320√ó200 in 4 or 16 colors (CGA compatibility) The 640√ó480 16-color and 320√ó200 256-color modes had fully redefinable palettes, with each entry selected from an 18-bit (262,144-color) gamut. The other modes defaulted to standard EGA or CGA compatible palettes and instructions, but still permitted remapping of the palette with VGA- specific commands.  640x480  As the VGA began to be cloned in great quantities by manufacturers who added ever-increasing capabilities, its 640x480, 16-color mode became the de-facto lowest common denominator of graphics cards. By the mid 90s, a 640x480x16 graphics mode using the VGA memory and register specifications was expected by operating systems such as Windows 95 and OS/2 Warp 3.0, which provided no support for lower resolutions or bit depths, or support for other memory or register layouts without additional drivers. Well into the 2000s, even after the VESA standard for graphics cards became commonplace, the \\"VGA\\" graphics mode remained a fallback option for PC operating systems. =Other modes= Nonstandard display modes can be implemented, with horizontal resolutions of: *512 to 800 pixels wide, in 16 colors *256 to 400 pixels wide, in 256 colors And heights of: *200, or 350 to 410 lines (including 400-line) at 70 Hz refresh rate, or *224 to 256, or 448 to 512 lines (including 240 or 480-line) at 60 Hz refresh rate *512 to 600 lines at reduced vertical refresh rates (down to 50 Hz, and including e.g. 528, 544, 552, 560, 576-line), depending on individual monitor compatibility. For example, high resolution modes with square pixels are available at 768√ó576 or 704√ó528 in 16 colors, or medium-low resolution at 320√ó240 with 256 colors. Alternatively, extended resolution is available with \\"fat\\" pixels and 256 colors using, e.g. 400√ó600 (50 Hz) or 360√ó480 (60 Hz), and \\"thin\\" pixels, 16 colors and the 70 Hz refresh rate with e.g. 736√ó410 mode. \\"Narrow\\" modes such as 256√ó224 tend to preserve the same pixel ratio as in e.g. 320√ó240 mode unless the monitor is adjusted to stretch the image out to fill the screen, as they are derived simply by masking down the wider mode instead of altering pixel or line timings, but can be useful for reducing memory requirements and pixel addressing calculations for arcade game conversions or console emulators. =Standard text modes= VGA also implements several text modes: *80√ó25, rendered with a 9√ó16 pixel font, with an effective resolution of 720√ó400 *40√ó25, with a 9x16 font, with an effective resolution of 360√ó400 *80√ó43 or 80√ó50, with an 8√ó8 font grid, with an effective resolution of 640√ó344 or 640√ó400 pixels. As with the pixel-based graphics modes, additional text modes are possible by programming the VGA correctly, with an overall maximum of about 100√ó80 cells and an active area spanning about 88√ó64 cells. One variant that is sometimes seen is 80√ó30 or 80√ó60, using an 8√ó16 or 8√ó8 font and an effective 640√ó480 pixel display, which trades use of the more flickery 60 Hz mode for an additional 5 or 10 lines of text and square character blocks (or, at 80√ó30, square half-blocks). Technical details Unlike the cards that preceded it, which used binary TTL signals to interface with a monitor (or composite, in the case of the CGA,) the VGA introduced a video interface using pure analog RGB signals, 0.7 volts peak-to-peak max. In conjunction with an 18-bit RAMDAC this permitted a color gamut of 262,144 colors. The original VGA specifications are as follows: *Selectable 25.175 MHz or 28.322 MHz master pixel clock *Maximum of 640 horizontal pixelsPS/2 Video Subsystem Technical Reference Manual 1992 *Maximum of 480 lines *Refresh rates at up to 70 Hz *Vertical blank interrupt (Not all clone cards support this.) *Planar mode: up to 16 colors (4 bit planes) *Packed-pixel mode: 256 colors (Mode 13h) *Hardware smooth scrolling support *No Blitter Supports fast data transfers via \\"VGA latch\\" registers *Barrel shifter *Split screen support =Signal timings= The intended standard value for the horizontal frequency of VGA's 640x480 mode is exactly double the value used in the NTSC-M video system, as this made it much easier to offer optional TV-out solutions or external VGA-to-TV converter boxes at the time of VGA's development. It is also at least nominally twice that of CGA, which also supported composite monitors. All derived VGA timings (i.e. those which use the master 25.175 and 28.322 MHz crystals and, to a lesser extent, the nominal 31.469 kHz line rate) can be varied by software that bypasses the VGA firmware interface and communicates directly with the VGA hardware, as many MS-DOS based games did. However, only the standard modes, or modes that at least use almost exactly the same H-sync and V-sync timings as one of the standard modes, can be expected to work with the original late-1980s and early-1990s VGA monitors. The use of other timings may in fact damage such monitors and thus was usually avoided by software publishers. Third-party \\"multisync\\" CRT monitors were more flexible, and in combination with \\"super EGA\\", VGA, and later SVGA graphics cards using extended modes, could display a much wider range of resolutions and refresh rates at arbitrary sync frequencies and pixel clock rates. For the most common VGA mode (640√ó480, 60 Hz, non-interlaced), the horizontal timings are:HP D1194A Super VGA Display & HP D1195A Erognomic Super VGA Display Installation Guide, Hewlett Packard =Typical uses of selected modes= 640√ó400 @ 70 Hz is traditionally the video mode used for booting VGA- compatible x86 personal computers 090425 epanorama.net that show a graphical boot screen, while text-mode boot uses 720√ó400 @ 70 Hz. This convention has been eroded in recent years, however, with POST and BIOS screens moving to higher resolutions, taking advantage of EDID data to match the resolution to a connected monitor. 640√ó480 @ 60 Hz is the default Windows graphics mode (usually with 16 colors), up to Windows 2000. It remains an option in XP and later versions via the boot menu \\"low resolution video\\" option and per- application compatibility mode settings, despite Windows now defaulting to 1024x768 and generally not allowing any resolution below 800x600 to be set. The need for such a low-quality, universally compatible fallback has diminished since the turn of the millennium, as VGA-signalling-standard screens or adaptors unable to show anything beyond the original resolutions have become increasingly rare. 320√ó200 @ 70 Hz was the most common mode for VGA-era PC games. Connector left VGA BNC connectors The standard VGA monitor interface is a 15-pin D-subminiature connector in the \\"E\\" shell, variously referred to as \\"HD-15\\", \\"DE-15\\" and \\"DB-15.\\" Because VGA uses low- voltage analog signals, signal degradation becomes a factor with low-quality or overly long cables. Solutions include shielded cables, cables that include a separate internal coaxial cable for each color signal, and \\"broken out\\" cables utilizing a separate coaxial cable with a BNC connector for each color signal. BNC breakout cables typically use five connectors, one each for Red, Green, Blue, Horizontal Sync, and Vertical Sync, and do not include the other signal lines of the VGA interface. With BNC, the coaxial wires are fully shielded end-to-end and through the interconnect so that no crosstalk or external interference is possible. Color palette leftExamples of VGA images in 640√ó480 with 16 colors and 320√ó200 with 256 colours (bottom). Dithering is used to mask color limitations. The VGA color system uses register-based palettes to map colors in various bit depths to its 18-bit output gamut. It is backward compatible with the EGA and CGA adapters, but supports extra bit depth for the palette when in these modes. For instance, when in EGA 16-color modes, VGA offers 16 palette registers, and in 256-color modes, it offers 256 registers. Each palette register contain a 3√ó6 bit RGB value, selecting a color from the 18-bit gamut of the DAC. These color registers are initialized to default values IBM expected to be most useful for each mode. For instance, EGA 16-color modes initialize to the default CGA 16-color palette, and the 256-color mode initializes to a palette consisting of 16 CGA colors, 16 grey shades, and then 216 colors chosen by IBM to fit expected use cases. After initialization they can be redefined at any time without altering the contents of video RAM, permitting palette cycling. In the 256-color modes, the DAC is set to combine four 2-bit color values, one from each plane, into an 8-bit-value representing an index into the 256-color palette. The CPU interface combines the 4 planes in the same way, a feature called \\"chain-4,\\" so that each the pixel appears to the CPU as a packed 8-bit value representing the palette index.Uphoff, Matthias (1990). Die Programmierung der EGA/VGA Grafikkarte; ; this whole section was learned from this book Use The video memory of the VGA is mapped to the PC's memory via a window in the range between segments 0xA0000 and 0xBFFFF in the PC's real mode address space (A000:0000 and B000:FFFF in segment:offset notation). Typically, these starting segments are: * 0xA0000 for EGA/VGA graphics modes (64 KB) * 0xB0000 for monochrome text mode (32 KB) * 0xB8000 for color text mode and CGA-compatible graphics modes (32 KB) Due to the use of different address mappings for different modes, it is possible to have a monochrome adapter (i.e. MDA or Hercules) and a color adapter such as the VGA, EGA, or CGA installed in the same machine. At the beginning of the 1980s, this was typically used to display Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets in high-resolution text on a monochrome display and associated graphics on a low-resolution CGA display simultaneously. Many programmers also used such a setup with the monochrome card displaying debugging information while a program ran in graphics mode on the other card. Several debuggers, like Borland's Turbo Debugger, D86 and Microsoft's CodeView could work in a dual monitor setup. Either Turbo Debugger or CodeView could be used to debug Windows. There were also DOS device drivers such as \`ox.sys\`, which implemented a serial interface simulation on the monochrome display and, for example, allowed the user to receive crash messages from debugging versions of Windows without using an actual serial terminal. It is also possible to use the \\"MODE MONO\\" command at the DOS prompt to redirect the output to the monochrome display. When a monochrome adapter was not present, it was possible to use the 0xB000‚Äì0xB7FF address space as additional memory for other programs. = Programming = \\"Unchaining\\" the 256 KB VGA memory into four separate \\"planes\\" makes VGA's 256 KB of RAM available in 256-color modes. There is a trade-off for extra complexity and performance loss in some types of graphics operations, but this is mitigated by other operations becoming faster in certain situations: *Single-color polygon filling could be accelerated due to the ability to set four pixels with a single write to the hardware. *The video adapter could assist in copying video RAM regions, which was sometimes faster than doing this with the relatively slow CPU-to-VGA interface. *The use of multiple video pages in hardware allowed double buffering, triple buffering or split screens, which, while available in VGA's 320√ó200 16-color mode, was not possible using stock Mode 13h. *Most particularly, several higher, arbitrary-resolution display modes were possible, all the way up to the programmable limit of 800√ó600 with 16 colors (or 400√ó600 with 256 colors), as well as other custom modes using unusual combinations of horizontal and vertical pixel counts in either color mode. Software such as Fractint, Xlib and ColoRIX also supported tweaked 256-color modes on standard adaptors using freely-combinable widths of 256, 320, and 360 pixels and heights of 200, 240 and 256 (or 400, 480 and 512) lines, extending still further to 384 or 400 pixel columns and 576 or 600 (or 288, 300). However, 320√ó240 was the best known and most frequently used, as it offered a standard 40-column resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio with square pixels. \\"320√ó240√ó8\\" resolution was commonly called Mode X, the name used by Michael Abrash when he presented the resolution in Dr. Dobb's Journal. The highest resolution modes were only used in special, opt-in cases rather than as standard, especially where high line counts were involved. Standard VGA monitors had a fixed line scan (H-scan) rate\\"multisync\\" monitors being, at the time, expensive exoticaand so the vertical/frame (V-scan) refresh rate had to be reduced in order to accommodate them, which increased visible flicker and thus eye strain. For example, the highest 800√ó600 mode, being otherwise based on the matching SVGA resolution (with 628 total lines), reduced the refresh rate from 60 Hz to about 50 Hz (and 832√ó624, the theoretical maximum resolution achievable with 256kb at 16 colors, would have reduced it to about 48 Hz, barely higher than the rate at which XGA monitors employed a double- frequency interlacing technique to mitigate full-frame flicker). These modes were also outright incompatible with some monitors, producing display problems such as picture detail disappearing into overscan (especially in the horizontal dimension), vertical roll, poor horizontal sync or even a complete lack of picture depending on the exact mode attempted. Due to these potential issues, most VGA tweaks used in commercial products were limited to more standards-compliant, \\"monitor-safe\\" combinations, such as 320√ó240 (square pixels, three video pages, 60 Hz), 320√ó400 (double resolution, two video pages, 70 Hz), and 360√ó480 (highest resolution compatible with both standard VGA monitors and cards, one video page, 60 Hz) in 256 colors, or double the H-rez in 16-color mode.

National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC The Sulu Archipelago islands are within the Mindanao island group, consisting of the provinces of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. The archipelago is not, as is often supposed, the remains of a land bridge between Borneo and the Philippines. Rather, it is the exposed edge of small submarine ridges produced by tectonic tilting of the sea bottom. Basilan, Jolo, Tawitawi and other islands in the group are extinct volcanic cones rising from the southernmost ridge. Tawi- Tawi, the southernmost island of the group, has a serpentine basement-complex core with a limestone covering. This island chain is an important migration route for birds. The largest municipalities in the area are on the island of Jolo. The larger island of Palawan to its north, the coastal regions of the westward-extending Zamboanga Peninsula of Mindanao, and the north-eastern part of the island of Borneo were formerly parts of the thalassocratic Sultanate of Sulu. The archipelago is the home of the indigenous Tausug people; various group of Samal (or Sama) people including the semi-nomadic Badjaw; the land- based Sama; the related Yakan people; and the Jama Mapun people. The Tausug language is spoken widely in the Sulu Archipelago as both first and second languages throughout these islands. The Yakan language is spoken mainly in Basilan Island.

The Sulu Archipelago was once part of Majapahit Empire and mentioned in the Old Javanese eulogy of Nagarakretagama by the name \\"Solot\\". After that, it became part of the Bruneian Empire before gaining its own independence on 1578. The region then became part of the independent Sultanate of Sulu, founded in 1405. The arrival of Western powers later became a conflict when the Spanish start to impose the rule of Spanish East Indies over the Sulu Archipelago. Spanish military expeditions against the sultanate were launched over the centuries of the colonial Philippines period (1565‚Äì1946). The Moro Rebellion (1899‚Äì1913) independence movement continued the Islamic Moro conflict, against the United States occupation in areas of the Moro people in the archipelago and southwestern Philippines. =1405‚Äì1844: Sulu Sultanate and Spanish East Indies= Pre-1636 Sultanate of Sulu trade range. The Sulu Archipelago was part of the Islamic Sultanate of Sulu, founded in 1405 by Shari‚Äôful Hashem Syed Abu Bak‚Äôr. The sultanate also included portions of Borneo, Mindanao, Palawan, and other islands in the region. From the first Spanish encounters with Jolo island, the Spanish‚ÄìMoro conflict met firm and organised resistance from the Sultanate of Sulu. Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi had established a colony in Cebu in May 1565, however the initial focus of the Spanish conquest to establish the Spanish East Indies was northwards. In June 1578 Francisco de Sande, Governor-General of the Spanish East Indies, dispatched captain Esteban Rodr√≠guez de Figueroa and the Jesuit priest Juan del Campo and the coadjutor Gaspar G√≥mez to Jolo, resulting in a negotiated compromise where the Sulu sultan paid a regular tribute in pearls. The following year, Figueroa was awarded the sole right to colonise Mindanao. In 1587, during a campaign against Borneo launched by Sande, Figueroa attacked and burned down Jolo. The Spaniards left Jolo after a few days. The Joloanos resolved to resist Spanish intrusions. In response to attacks, Joloanos raided Spanish settlements and reducciones. In 1593, the first permanent Roman Catholic mission was established on the Zamboanga Peninsula, and three years later, the Spanish Army launched another attack on Jolo, which was repelled by the army of Rajah Bongsu. In November 1593, the Spanish Empire sent Juan Ronquillo to Tampakan to thwart the slave raiders. The following year, the Spanish Army troops relocated to Caldera Bay (Recodo), Mindanao. In 1598, another expedition was launched against Jolo, but was repelled by the Joloanos. In late 1600, Captain Juan Gallinato with a group of about 200 Spanish soldiers attacked Jolo but were unsuccessful. By 1601, after three months of heavy fighting, the Spanish troops retreated. In 1628, a larger raiding force of about 200 Spanish army officers and 1,600 soldiers was organised to attack Jolo to defeat the Moslem slave raiders and traders, but the Spanish again failed to take Jolo. Again on 17 March 1630, a large Spanish force of 2,500 soldiers attacked Jolo but to no avail. When its commander Lorenzo de Olazo was wounded, the Spaniards retreated. The Sultanate of Sulu range in 1636 with the arrival of Spain. On 4 January 1638, de Corcuera led a naval and military expedition of about 80 ships and 2,000 troops to attack Jolo, but Sultan Wasit put up stiff resistance. However, Sultan Wasit's kuta army suffered a serious epidemic of tropical disease and he and his chieftains sought refuge in the Dungun area of Tawi-Tawi. The Spanish Army easily occupied Jolo, and a small garrison was left there to control the area. The garrison was withered away by frequent raids launched by Sultan Wasit, and by 1645, this garrison had been wasted away. This was the first time that Jolo had been occupied by the Spaniards for an appreciable length of time. From 1663 to 1718, an interregnum of peace occurred because the Spanish troops were ordered to abandon the Zamboanga Peninsula, and forts south of thatand regroup in Manila to prepare for the impending attack of Koxingawhich never happened. Hostilities resumed in the 18th century, triggered by the 1718 decision by governor Gen Juan Antonio dela Torre Bustamante to reconstruct the fort Real Fuerza de San Jos√© in Bagumbayan, Zamboanga. The fort was completed in 1719, renamed Real Fuerza del Pilar de Zaragosa (Fort Pilar is its popular name today), and inaugurated on 16 April. Three years later in 1722, the Spaniards launched another expedition against Jolo led by Andr√©s Garc√≠a; this expedition failed. In 1731, General Ignacio Iriberri lead a force of 1000 to Jolo and captured it after a lengthy siege, but the Spaniards again left after a few days. In 1755, a force of 1,900 Spanish soldiers led by the captains Sime√≥n Valdez and Pedro Gastambide was sent to Jolo in revenge for the raids by Sultan Muiz ud-Din, but the Spaniards were defeated. In 1775, after a Moro raid on Zamboanga, Captain Vargas led a punitive expedition against Jolo, but his force was repulsed. The Sulu areas in 1764 with the arrival of France. In the second half of the 18th century, Great Britain became a new player in the archipelago After occupying Manila from 1762‚Äì64, during the Seven Years' War between Spain, Great Britain and other European powers, the British Army withdrew to the south and established trading alliances between the Sulu Sultanate and the British East India Company. Spanish attacks on Jolo were now directed at weakening British trading interests in the south. In 1784, Aguilar conducted a series of unsuccessful assaults against Jolo and in 1796, Spanish admiral Jos√© Alava was sent from Madrid with a powerful naval fleet to stop the slave-raiding attacks from the Sulu Sea. The British presence was signalled when in 1798, the British Royal Navy, which had established a base in Sulu, bombarded Fort Pilar in Zamboanga. In 1803, Lord Richard Wellesley, the Governor-General of India, ordered Robert J. Fraquhar to transfer trading and military operations to Balambangan island near Borneo. By 1895, the Great Britain had withdrawn its army and navy from the Sulu Sea. In 1815, the galleon trade across the Pacific Ocean between the Philippines and Mexico ended, since Mexico had declared its independence in 1810, and an extended war of independence was in progress. Most of the other Spanish-ruled areas of the Americas had also rebelled against their colonial masters. In 1821, the Philippine Islands were administered directly from Madrid, rather than via the Viceroy of Mexico, since Mexico and its southern neighbours had won their independence from Spain. The Spanish Empire sought to end the \\"Moro threat\\". In 1824, the Marina Sutil, a light and manoeuvrable naval force under Capitan Alonso Morgado was sent to confront the slave raiders in the Sulu Sea. =1844‚Äì1898: Spanish occupation= The Sulu Archipelago during the Spanish occupation. In 1844, Governor General Narciso Claveria led yet another expedition against Jolo and in 1848, Claveria with powerful gunboats Magallanes, El Cano, and Reina de Castilla brought from Europe supervised the attack on the Balangingi stronghold in Tungkil. The raid resulted in the capture of many Sama Balangingi and the exile of many to the tobacco fields of Cagayan Valley. The leader of the Sama, Paglima Taupan, was not captured. With the fall of the Balangingi, a powerful ally of the Sulu Sultanate was decimated, beginning the decline of the sultanate's maritime sea power. In 1850, Governor General Juan Urbiztondo continued with Claveria's campaign and annihilated the remaining Balangingi strongholds at Tungkil. A raid on Jolo that year was a failure. On 28 February 1851, Urbiztondo launched another campaign against Jolo, razed the whole town and confiscated 112 pieces of artillery. The Spanish troops later withdrew. Also in 1851 a peace treaty was signed between the Sulu Sultanate and the Spanish, though the terms were understood differently by each party. In 1876, the Spanish launched a campaign to occupy Jolo. Spurred by their need to curb slave raiding, and concerned about other European colonial efforts in the region, the Spanish made a final bid to consolidate their rule in their southern frontier. The British had established trading centres in Jolo by the 19th century and the French were offering to purchase Basilan Island from the Spanish government. On 21 February 1876, the Spaniards assembled the largest contingent against Jolo, consisting of 9,000 soldiers in 11 transports, 11 gunboats, and 11 steamboats. Headed by Admiral Jose Malcampo, they captured Jolo and established a Spanish settlement. Moro pirates of Balanguingui in 1848. Captain Pascual Cervera was appointed to set up a garrison and serve as military governor; he served from March 1876 to December 1876 followed by Jose Paulin (December 1876 ‚Äì April 1877), Carlos Martinez (Sept 1877 ‚Äì Feb 1880), Rafael de Rivera (1880‚Äì81), Isidro G. Soto (1881‚Äì82), Eduardo Bremon, (1882), Julian Parrrado (1882‚Äì84), Francisco Castilla (1884‚Äì86), Juan Arolas (1886‚Äì93), Caesar Mattos (1893), Venancio Hernandez (1893‚Äì96), and Luis Huerta (1896‚Äì99). The Spaniards were never secured in Jolo, and by 1878 they had fortified the town with a perimeter wall and tower gates, built inner forts called Puerta Blockaus, Puerta Espa√±a, and Puerta Alfonso XII, and two outer fortifications named Princesa de Asturias and Torre de la Reina when Sultanate of Sulu formally recognised Spanish sovereignty in middle of 19th century, but these areas remained partially ruled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations and garrisons and pockets of civilian settlements. Troops, including a cavalry unit with its own lieutenant commander, were garrisoned within the protective walls. In 1880 Colonel Rafael Gonzales de Rivera, who was appointed by the Governor General, dispatched the 6th Regiment to Siasi and Bongao Islands. The Spaniards' stronghold was sporadically attacked. On 22 July 1883, it was reported that three unnamed men had succeeded in penetrating Jolo's town plaza and killed three Spaniards. The word ‚ÄúAjuramentado‚Äù was coined by the Spanish colonel Juan Arolas after witnessing several such raids while serving with the Jolo garrison. =1898‚Äì1946: American occupation= The American occupation steps over the Sulu Archipelago in 1899. The situation until the end of World War II. The situation until the independence of the Philippines. In 1898, the war between Spain and America broke out. Commodore George Dewey of the US Navy defeated the Spanish fleet in the Battle of Manila Bay, following which the American army occupied Manila. The United States took possession of the Philippines under international law after the 1898 Treaty of Paris ended the war. The Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War followed in 1898 for three months, during which the American military fought and defeated the Philippine forces under Emilio Aguinaldo for control of the Philippines. After the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, the Moro Rebellion (1899‚Äì1913) independence movement continued the Spanish‚ÄìMoro conflict, now against the United States occupation of the Philippines. The Sulu Archipelago was considered part of Islamic Moroland by the movement. World War II In December 1941, Japan attacked the United States in the Philippines and at Pearl Harbor, and the United States declared war on Japan as part of World War II. Japan conquered the Philippines in 1942, in the Philippines Campaign (1941‚Äì42). In 1944 the Allies' Philippines Campaign (1944‚Äì45) against the Japanese occupation began with the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Allied forces eventually drove the Japanese from the islands. =1946‚Äìpresent: Philippine Independence= On 4 July 1946, the Philippines became an independent nation. The fortifications of Jolo remained in good state during the American occupation when its walls, gates, and the buildings within it were photographed. Early 20th century photographs of Jolo show a well-ordered town, neatly laid out in a grid of streets and blocks‚Äîcharacteristics of Spanish urbanism applied with a military rigidity. In the postwar years the walls degraded. Jolo suffered major destruction due to bombardment and fire during the military operations against the Moro Islamic independence forces in Jolo in 1973. , short stretches of degraded perimeter wall still exist, but are covered by buildings or are partially demolished to less than in height. Autonomy The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) areas in green. The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) is the current political entity that the Sulu Archipelago islands are within. Bangsamoro, officially known as the Autonomous Government of Bangsamoro (Filipino: Nagsasariling Pamahalan ng Bangsamoro), is a proposed autonomous political entity within the Philippines. The proposal is part of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro, a preliminary peace agreement signed between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Philippine government.

The special attribute of this parser is that any LR(k) grammar with k>1 can be transformed into an LR(1) grammar. However, back-substitutions are required to reduce k and as back- substitutions increase, the grammar can quickly become large, repetitive and hard to understand. LR(k) can handle all deterministic context-free languages. In the past this LR(k) parser has been avoided because of its huge memory requirements in favor of less powerful alternatives such as the LALR and the LL(1) parser. Recently, however, a \\"minimal LR(1) parser\\" whose space requirements are close to LALR parsers, is being offered by several parser generators. Like most parsers, the LR(1) parser is automatically generated by compiler compilers like GNU Bison, MSTA, Menhir, HYACC,.  History  In 1965 Donald Knuth invented the LR(k) parser (Left to right, Rightmost derivation parser) a type of shift-reduce parser, as a generalization of existing precedence parsers. This parser has the potential of recognizing all deterministic context-free languages and can produce both left and right derivations of statements encountered in the input file. Knuth proved that it reaches its maximum language recognition power for k=1 and provided a method for transforming LR(k), k > 1 grammars into LR(1) grammars. Canonical LR(1) parsers have the practical disadvantage of having enormous memory requirements for their internal parser-table representation. In 1969, Frank DeRemer suggested two simplified versions of the LR parser called LALR and SLR. These parsers require much less memory than Canonical LR(1) parsers, but have slightly less language-recognition power. LALR(1) parsers have been the most common implementations of the LR Parser. However, a new type of LR(1) parser, some people call a \\"Minimal LR(1) parser\\" was introduced in 1977 by David Pager who showed that LR(1) parsers can be created whose memory requirements rival those of LALR(1) parsers. Recently, some parser generators are offering Minimal LR(1) parsers, which not only solve the memory requirement problem, but also the mysterious-conflict-problem inherent in LALR(1) parser generators. In addition, Minimal LR(1) parsers can use shift-reduce actions, which makes them faster than Canonical LR(1) parsers.  Overview  The LR(1) parser is a deterministic automaton and as such its operation is based on static state transition tables. These codify the grammar of the language it recognizes and are typically called \\"parsing tables\\". The parsing tables of the LR(1) parser are parameterized with a lookahead terminal. Simple parsing tables, like those used by the LR(0) parser represent grammar rules of the form : A1 ‚Üí A, B which means that if we go from state A to state B then we will go to state A1 . After parameterizing such a rule with a lookahead we have: : A1 ‚Üí A, B, a which means that the transition will now be performed only if the lookahead terminal is a. This allows for richer languages where a simple rule can have different meanings depending on the lookahead context. For example, in a LR(1) grammar, all of the following rules transition to a different state in spite of being based on the same state sequence. : A1 ‚Üí A, B, a : A2 ‚Üí A, B, b : A3 ‚Üí A, B, c : A4 ‚Üí A, B, d The same would not be true if a lookahead terminal was not being taken into account. Parsing errors can be identified without the parser having to read the whole input by declaring some rules as errors. For example, : E1 ‚Üí B, C, d can be declared an error, causing the parser to stop. This means that the lookahead information can also be used to catch errors, as in the following example: : A1 ‚Üí A, B, a : A1 ‚Üí A, B, b : A1 ‚Üí A, B, c : E1 ‚Üí A, B, d In this case A, B will be reduced to A1 when the lookahead is a, b or c and an error will be reported when the lookahead is d. The lookahead can also be helpful in deciding when to reduce a rule. The lookahead can help avoid reducing a specific rule if the lookahead is not valid, which would probably mean that the current state should be combined with the following instead of the previous state. That means in the following example * State sequence: A, B, C * Rules: :: A1 ‚Üí A, B :: A2 ‚Üí B, C the state sequence can be reduced to : A, A2 instead of : A1, C if the lookahead after the parser went to state B wasn't acceptable, i.e. no transition rule existed. States can be produced directly from a terminal as in : X ‚Üí y which allows for state sequences to appear. LR(1) parsers have the requirement that each rule should be expressed in a complete LR(1) manner, i.e. a sequence of two states with a specific lookahead. That makes simple rules such as : X ‚Üí y requiring a great many artificial rules that essentially enumerate the combinations of all the possible states and lookahead terminals that can follow. A similar problem appears for implementing non-lookahead rules such as : A1 ‚Üí A, B where all the possible lookaheads must be enumerated. That is the reason why LR(1) parsers cannot be practically implemented without significant memory optimizations.  Constructing LR(1) parsing tables  LR(1) parsing tables are constructed in the same way as LR(0) parsing tables with the modification that each Item contains a lookahead terminal. This means, contrary to LR(0) parsers, a different action may be executed, if the item to process is followed by a different terminal. = Parser items = Starting from the production rules of a language, at first the item sets for this language have to be determined. In plain words, an item set is the list of production rules, which the currently processed symbol might be part of. An item set has a one-to-one correspondence to a parser state, while the items within the set, together with the next symbol, are used to decide which state transitions and parser action are to be applied. Each item contains a marker, to note at which point the currently processed symbol appears in the rule the item represents. For LR(1) parsers, each item is specific to a lookahead terminal, thus the lookahead terminal has also been noted inside each item. For example, assume a language consisting of the terminal symbols 'n', '+', '(', ')', the nonterminals 'E', 'T', the starting rule 'S' and the following production rules: : S ‚Üí E : E ‚Üí T : E ‚Üí ( E ) : T ‚Üí n : T ‚Üí + T : T ‚Üí T + n Items sets will be generated by analog to the procedure for LR(0) parsers. The item set 0 which represents the initial state will be created from the starting rule: : [S ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ E, $] The dot '‚Ä¢' denotes the marker of the current parsing position within this rule. The expected lookahead terminal to apply this rule is noted after the comma. The '$' sign is used to denote 'end of input' is expected, as is the case for the starting rule. This is not the complete item set 0, though. Each item set must be 'closed', which means all production rules for each nonterminal following a '‚Ä¢' have to be recursively included into the item set until all of those nonterminals are dealt with. The resulting item set is called the closure of the item set we began with. For LR(1) for each production rule an item has to be included for each possible lookahead terminal following the rule. For more complex languages this usually results in very large item sets, which is the reason for the large memory requirements of LR(1) parsers. In our example, the starting symbol requires the nonterminal 'E' which in turn requires 'T', thus all production rules will appear in item set 0. At first, we ignore the problem of finding the lookaheads and just look at the case of an LR(0), whose items do not contain lookahead terminals. So the item set 0 (without lookaheads) will look like this: : [S ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ E] : [E ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T] : [E ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ ( E )] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ n] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ + T] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T + n] = FIRST and FOLLOW sets = To determine lookahead terminals, so-called FIRST and FOLLOW sets are used. FIRST(A) is the set of terminals which can appear as the first element of any chain of rules matching nonterminal A. FOLLOW(I) of an Item I [A ‚Üí Œ± ‚Ä¢ B Œ≤, x] is the set of terminals that can appear immediately after nonterminal B, where Œ±, Œ≤ are arbitrary symbol strings, and x is an arbitrary lookahead terminal. FOLLOW(k,B) of an item set k and a nonterminal B is the union of the follow sets of all items in k where '‚Ä¢' is followed by B. The FIRST sets can be determined directly from the closures of all nonterminals in the language, while the FOLLOW sets are determined from the items under usage of the FIRST sets. In our example, as one can verify from the full list of item sets below, the first sets are: : FIRST(S) = { n, '+', '(' } : FIRST(E) = { n, '+', '(' } : FIRST(T) = { n, '+' } = Determining lookahead terminals = Within item set 0 the follow sets can be found to be: : FOLLOW(0,S) = { $ } : FOLLOW(0,E) = { $, ')'} : FOLLOW(0,T) = { $, '+', ')' } From this the full item set 0 for an LR(1) parser can be created, by creating for each item in the LR(0) item set one copy for each terminal in the follow set of the LHS nonterminal. Each element of the follow set may be a valid lookahead terminal: : [S ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ E, $] : [E ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T, $] : [E ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T, )] : [E ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ ( E ), $] : [E ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ ( E ), )] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ n, $] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ n, +] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ n, )] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ + T, $] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ + T, +] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ + T, )] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T + n, $] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T + n, +] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T + n, )] = Creating new item sets = The rest of the item sets can be created by the following algorithm : 1. For each terminal and nonterminal symbol A appearing after a '‚Ä¢' in each already existing item set k, create a new item set m by adding to m all the rules of k where '‚Ä¢' is followed by A, but only if m will not be the same as an already existing item set after step 3. : 2. shift all the '‚Ä¢'s for each rule in the new item set one symbol to the right : 3. create the closure of the new item set : 4. Repeat from step 1 for all newly created item sets, until no more new sets appear In the example we get 5 more sets from item set 0, item set 1 for nonterminal E, item set 2 for nonterminal T, item set 3 for terminal n, item set 4 for terminal '+' and item set 5 for '('. Item set 1 (E): : [S ‚Üí E ‚Ä¢, $] Item set 2 (T): : [E ‚Üí T ‚Ä¢, $] : [T ‚Üí T ‚Ä¢ + n, $] : [T ‚Üí T ‚Ä¢ + n, +] : ¬∑ : ¬∑ : ¬∑ Item set 3 (n): : [T ‚Üí n ‚Ä¢, $] : [T ‚Üí n ‚Ä¢, +] : [T ‚Üí n ‚Ä¢, )] Item set 4 ('+'): : [T ‚Üí + ‚Ä¢ T, $] : [T ‚Üí + ‚Ä¢ T, +] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ n, $] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ n, +] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ + T, $] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ + T, +] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T + n, $] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T + n, +] : ¬∑ : ¬∑ : ¬∑ Item set 5 ('('): : [E ‚Üí ( ‚Ä¢ E ), $] : [E ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T, )] : [E ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ ( E ), )] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ n, )] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ n, +] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ + T, )] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ + T, +] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T + n, )] : [T ‚Üí ‚Ä¢ T + n, +] : ¬∑ : ¬∑ : ¬∑ From item sets 2, 4 and 5 several more item sets will be produced. The complete list is quite long and thus will not be stated here. Detailed LR(k) treatment of this grammar can e.g. be found in . = Goto = The lookahead of an LR(1) item is used directly only when considering reduce actions (i.e., when the ‚Ä¢ marker is at the right end). The core of an LR(1) item [S ‚Üí a A ‚Ä¢ B e, c] is the LR(0) item S ‚Üí a A ‚Ä¢ B e. Different LR(1) items may share the same core. For example, in item set 2 : [E ‚Üí T ‚Ä¢, $] : [T ‚Üí T ‚Ä¢ + n, $] : [T ‚Üí T ‚Ä¢ + n, +] the parser is required to perform the reduction [E ‚Üí T] if the next symbol is '$', but to do a shift if the next symbol is '+'. Note that a LR(0) parser would not be able to make this decision, as it only considers the core of the items, and would thus report a shift/reduce conflict. A state containing [A ‚Üí Œ± ‚Ä¢ X Œ≤, a] will move to a state containing [A ‚Üí Œ± X ‚Ä¢ Œ≤, a] with label X. Every state has transitions according to Goto. = Shift actions = If [A ‚Üí Œ± ‚Ä¢ b Œ≤, a] is in state Ik and Ik moves to state Im with label b, then we add the action : action[Ik, b] = \\"shift m\\" = Reduce actions = If [A‚ÜíŒ± ‚Ä¢, a] is in state Ik, then we add the action : action[Ik, a] = \\"reduce A ‚Üí Œ±\\"  References   External links  * Practical LR(k) Parser Construction HTML page, David Tribble * First & Follow Sets Construction in Python (Narayana Chikkam) Category:Parsing algorithms ","title":"Canonical LR parser"},{"id":"73062","text":"In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, illithids (commonly known as mind flayers) are monstrous humanoid aberrations with psionic powers.

Monster Manual (Wizards of the Coast, 2014) Typical physical characteristics Illithids have a humanoid body with an octopus-like head. They have four tentacles around a lamprey-like mouth, and require the brains of sentient creatures as part of their diet. An illithid who snares a living creature in all four of its tentacles can extract and devour its living brain. Their eyes are pale white, and they can see perfectly well in both darkness and light. Their sense of hearing is slightly poorer than a human's; they have difficulty distinguishing between several sounds mixed together, yet they are good at discerning from what direction sounds came from. Their skin is purplish blue to gray-green and covered in mucus, and is very sensitive to sunlight. They loathe sunlight, though it does not actually harm them. One of their most feared powers is the dreaded Mind Blast, where the illithid emits a cone- shaped psionic shock wave with its mind in order to incapacitate any creature for a short amount of time. Illithids also have other psionic powers, generally telepathic in nature, although their exact effects have varied over editions. Other powers include a defensive psionic shield and powers of psionic domination for controlling the minds of others. =Biology= Illithids are hermaphroditic creatures who each spawn a mass of larvae two or three times in their life. The larvae resemble miniature illithid heads or four-tentacled tadpoles. Larvae are left to develop in the pool of the Elder Brain. The ones that survive after 10 years are inserted into the brain of a sapient creature. Hosts are determined in a very specific manner. Hosts generally are humanoid creatures that are between 5 feet 4 inches and 6 feet 2 inches. The most desirable of races for hosts are Humans, Drow, Elves, Githzerai, Githyanki , Grimlocks, Gnolls, Goblinoids, and Orcs. Upon being implanted (through the ear canal), the larva then grows and consumes the host's brain, absorbing the host's physical form entirely and becoming sapient itself, a physically mature (but mentally young) Illithid. This process is called ceremorphosis. Illithids often experiment with non-humanoid hosts, but ceremorphosis involving other creatures usually fails, killing both host and larva. The transformation between the host (almost always a human or similar humanoid, such as an elf or dwarf) takes about a week, unless detected and removed within about thirty minutes of injection into the incapacitated host. When an Illithid undergoes ceremorphosis, it can occasionally take on some elements of the absorbed host creature's former mind, such as mannerisms. This typically manifests as a minor personality feature, such as a nervous habit or reaction (e.g., nail-biting or tapping one's foot), although the process that determines the type and number of traits so inherited appears to be stochastic. Some adult Illithids have even been known to hum a tune that its host knew in life. Usually, when a mind flayer inherits a trait like this, it keeps it a closely guarded secret, because, were its peers to learn of it, the Illithid in question would most likely be killed. This is due to an Illithid legend of a being called the \\"Adversary\\". The legend holds that, eventually, an Illithid larva that undergoes ceremorphosis will take on the host's personality and memory in its entirety. This Adversary would, mind and soul, still be the host, but with all the inherent abilities of an Illithid. Occasionally, ceremorphosis can partially fail. Sometimes the larva does not contain enough chemicals to complete the process, sometimes there is psionic interference. Whatever the reason, it has happened that ceremorphosis has ended after the internal restructuring, resulting in a human body with an Illithid's brain, personality and digestive tract. These unfortunates must still consume brains, typically by cutting open heads (as they lack the requisite tentacles). These beings are often used as spies, where they easily blend in with their respective host types. Illithid society also maintains a long-standing taboo related to deviations to or failures of the ceremorphosis process and hunt and destroy such exceptions. Occasionally mind flayer communities are attacked (often by vengeful Githyanki and Githzerai) and their inhabitants must flee. This leaves the larvae unattended. Bereft of exterior nourishment, they begin to consume one another. The survivor will eventually leave the pool in search of food (brains). This unmorphed larvae is known as Neothelids. If the Neothelid consumes an intelligent creature it will awaken to sapience and psionic abilities and grow to immense size, while retaining its memories of savage survival. In Complete Psionic, it was revealed that Illithids have a step between larva and Neothelid called a Larval Flayer, which looks like an overgrown tadpole. The existence of these beasts is a guarded secret among Illithids, and it is considered impolite to speak of them. Variants =Alhoon= Alhoons (also called illithiliches) are illithids that choose to focus on developing arcane abilities in addition to their psionic ones, and have grown powerful enough in magic to become undead liches. Alhoons are generally pariahs in illithid society because they go against most illithids' eventual goal; to merge with the Elder Brain, both physically and psionically. Alhoons, on the other hand, are more concerned with their own personal survival. When discovered near illithid communities Alhoons are mercilessly hunted down. The alhoon first appeared in second edition AD&D; for the Forgotten Realms setting in the Menzoberranzan boxed set, in the booklet \\"Book One: The City\\" (1992),Greenwood, Ed, Douglas Niles, and R. A. Salvatore. Menzoberranzan (TSR, 1992) and reprinted in Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Three (1996).Pickens, Jon, ed.

Monstrous Compendium: Monsters of Faer√ªn (Wizards of the Coast, 2001) and Lords of Madness (2005). =Ulitharid= Ulitharids are created from tadpoles much like standard illithids; fewer than 0.1% become ulitharids, and it is impossible to determine whether a tadpole will become an ulitharid until ceremorphosis is complete. Superior in nearly all ways to a regular mind flayer, ulitharids possess two extra tentacles, which are twice as long as the others, and an extreme arrogance, even by the standards of their own kind. Only the Elder Brain holds more sway within an illithid community. =Vampiric illithids= The origins of these unique undead mind flayers are unclear. All that is known of these creatures is that they cannot create spawn, need both fresh blood and fresh brains to survive, are more feral than typical illithids, and are barely intelligent. One possible origin is given in the Ravenloft adventure Thoughts of Darkness, in which a vampiress collaborates with the illithids in using the Apparatus to create the first vampiric illithid, a being never conceived of before.Thoughts of Darkness These creatures are hated and feared by typical illithids. =Yaggol= The yaggol are a variant presented in the Dragonlance campaign setting.Cook, David. Time of the Dragon (TSR, 1989)Heard, Bruce A, et al. Monstrous Compendium 4: Dragonlance Appendix (TSR, 1989) The Yaggol are a race from the Emerald Sea of Neron, a dark, steamy jungle in southern Taladas. The history of their civilization stretches back to the end of the first age of Krynn. Their empire was thriving at the same time the High Ogres of Ansalon founded their own empire. Enslaving the Cha'asii elves, the yaggol ruled over the continent with a nightmarish will but this all came to end when the cha'asii learned how to defeat the mind powers of the yaggol. A great war was fought, and the empire crumbled as both sides nearly wiped each other out. All that remained of this once aberrant race were seven obsidian temples in The Valley of Akh-Tazi. After the shattering of the empire, an uneasy truce was struck, only broken by skirmishes and murder. The cha'asii went their separate ways; establishing villages like Ke-Cha-Yat where they could live in peace from the yaggol. This would all change with the coming of Gloomwing, a former orthlox Black Dragon that joined with the Brethren, the cult followers of Maladar an- Desh, Lord of Wizards. =Related creatures= Brain Golem: An eight-foot-tall humanoid-shaped construct made entirely of brain tissue, these creations exist only to serve an elder brain and its illithid community.

Illithocyte: Illithid tadpoles that survived the fall of a mind flayer empire, they evolved into a new life form and now crawl about in groups seeking psychic radiation on which to feed. Kezreth: A living troop transport and battle platform created from the severed head of a shamed illithid. They serve in this capacity in the hope of redeeming themselves and being allowed to return to the elder brain. Mind Worm: Created by illithids to serve as assassins and bounty hunters, these powerful psionic creatures resemble smaller purple worms. They can attack from far distances with their probe worms. Mindwitness: Inserting an illithid tadpole into a beholder results in these abominations, which are used as guards and sentries. Mozgriken: An illithid tadpole inserted into a svirfneblin gnome while subjected to a dangerous psionic ritual creates a mozgriken. These three-tentacled ceremorphs are despised by all, but their aptitude for stealth and psionic powers of stealth and shape control make them useful spies for the illithids. Neothelid: If an illithid tadpole survives but fails to undergo ceremorphosis, it will eventually grow into an incredibly powerful worm-like creature with illithid tentacles at the forefront of its body and immense mental powers. Nerve Swimmers: Derived from immature illithid tadpoles, these entities are living instruments of torture and interrogation. Nyraala Golem: A flailing, slimy, tentacled construct capable of launching surprise attacks. They often serve as guards, and are prized because their creation does not involve petitioning the elder brain to surrender part of its mass. Octopin: A six-tentacled, purple-skinned monstrosity with a single eye created by mind flayers. Oortlings: These docile humanoids with enlarged brains were bred by illithids as food. Seugathi: Seugathi are spawned by the hundreds by a single neothelid that has performed rituals to impregnate itself. Tzakandi: Illithid tadpoles inserted into lizardfolk create tzakandi, which the mind flayers use as slave labourers and personal guards. Uchuulon: A chuul implanted with an illithid tadpole becomes an uchuulon. Also known as slime chuuls, illithids use them as hunters and guardians. Urophion: Inserting an illithid tadpole into a roper results in these miserable creatures, which are used as guards and sentries. Ustilagor: Mind flayers farm these larval intellect devourers for food and sentries. Vampire Squid: Servitor creatures created by illithids to extend their reach below the surface of Underdark waters. They have a maw of sharp teeth which can be turned inside out and function as defensive spikes.Baur, Wolfgang. \\"The Dragon's Bestiary: Monsters of the Underdark.\\" Dragon #227 (TSR, 1996) Voidmind Creatures: A voidmind creature is an ordinary creature (such as a normal human or human-like creature or animal) whose mind has been nearly devoured by a mind flayer, but enough has been left intact for basic motor function. Further psionic rituals give these near dead creatures a semblance of life. The resulting creatures act as minions and spies for the Illithids. (From Dragon #150 : Monsters Associated With Illithids: Amorphs, Gelatinous cube, Gray ooze, Lurker above, Mimic, Ochre jelly, Pudding, deadly; Roper, Scum creeper, Slithering tracker, Trapper, Crystal ooze, Mustard jelly, Fungi, Ascomoid, Basidirond, Fungus, violet, Gas spore, Mold, brown; Mold, yellow; Obliviax, Phycomid, Shrieker, Ustilagor, Zygom, Illithidae, Carrion crawler, Cessirid, Embrac, Illithid, Kigrid Saltor ) =Symbionts= Illithids often create symbionts, a kind of living item eventually adapted for the Eberron campaign setting. Illithids use these symbionts for themselves and their slaves. These symbionts help their general offensive and defensive capabilities. Known illithid symbionts include the mnemonicus, wriggler, and carapace symbionts. History The origins of the illithids has been described in several conflicting stories offered in various D&D; products, in past editions and in the current version of the game, which can be taken as successive retcons. The 2nd Edition book The Illithiad suggests they may be from the Far Realm, an incomprehensible plane completely alien to the known multiverse. There is no mention of time travel in this theory. Instead, they emerged somewhere countless thousands of years ago, beyond the histories of many mortal races, and spread from one world to another, and another, and so on. It is explicitly stated in this book that the illithids appear in some of the most ancient histories of the most ancient races, even those that have no mention of other races. The 3.5 Edition D&D; supplement Lords of Madness provides that the Illithid were a star-faring people who existed at the end of time. Facing annihilation, the Illithid traveled to the past, arriving roughly 2000 years before the present in any given D&D; campaign. The 4th Edition preview Wizards Presents Worlds and Monsters supports the claim that mind flayers originate from the Far Realm. In these two differing versions of the story, much of the variance hinges upon a fictional text called The Sargonne Prophecies. The Illithiad described the Prophecies as misnamed, and that much of it sounds more like ancient myth than prophecy. Lords of Madness takes the name more literally, and states that The Sargonne Prophecies are in fact prophecy‚Äîor, perhaps more accurately, a history of the future. Yet another version came from The Astromundi Cluster, a Spelljammer boxed set produced before The Illithiad. This version holds that the illithids are descended from the outcasts of an ancient human society that ruled the now-shattered world called Astromundi. The outcast humans eventually mutated, deep underground, into the mind flayers. (This boxed set also introduced the entity known as Lugribossk, who was depicted as a god of the Astromundi flayers then, but was later retconned into a proxy of the god Ilsensine.) In the retconned history of the illithids found in either The Illithiad or Lords of Madness, the emergence of illithids in Astromundi becomes a freak occurrence due to the intervention of Ilsensine through its proxy, since the illithids of Astromundi have their own histories as emerging solely upon that world. However and whenever it occurred, when the illithids arrived in the Material Plane of the far past, they immediately began to build an empire by enslaving many sentient creatures. They were very successful, and soon their worlds-spanning empire became the largest one the multiverse had ever seen. They had the power‚Äîin terms of psychic potency and the manpower of countless slaves‚Äîto fashion artificial worlds. One such world was this empire's capital, called Penumbra, a diskworld built around a star, which was a thousand years in the making. Such was their might that the Blood War paused as the demons and devils considered a truce to deal with the illithid empire. Eventually, the primary slave race of the illithids developed resistance to the mental powers of their masters, and revolted. Led by the warrior Gith, the rebellion spread to all the illithids' worlds, and the empire collapsed. The illithid race itself seemed doomed. Gith was betrayed by one of her own generals, Zerthimon, who believed she had grown tyrannical and over- aggressive. Civil war erupted, and the race factionalised into the githyanki and the githzerai (and in the Spelljammer campaign setting the Pirates of Gith). This disruption allowed the illithids to retreat to underground strongholds where they still dwell. Dungeon #100 claims the original home of the gith forerunners was a world known as Pharagos. Currently it is described as, \\"an unremarkable Material-Plane world, a far cry from the hotbed of magical activity and divine intervention that is the Forgotten Realms campaign or the World of Greyhawk.\\" Beneath the Wasting Desert on that world, however, is the petrified corpse of the long-dead patron deity of the ancestors of the gith races. As is recounted in most 1st and 2nd edition sources, the ancestors of the gith forerunners were a human civilization before being modified by countless generations of illithid breeding and profane science. The background material of the Chainmail gameTweet, Jonathan, Rob Heinsoo, and Chris Pramas. Chainmail Miniatures Game: Blood and Darkness ‚Äì Set 2 Guidebook. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, 2002 places the gith forerunners in a subterranean empire called Zarum in Western Oerik, where they dominated many other races from their capital city of Anithor. These gith seem to have been divided into a rigid caste system, their lives ruled by ancient ritual. The ruins of Zarum overflow with sacred spaces and temples, though the names of the ancient gith gods are unknown today. The period of Zarum's height is not entirely clear, but grey elf sages speculate it was approximately 2,000 years before the Demon Wars that ravaged Western Oerik, or 3,000 years before the present. At some point, the illithids invaded Zarum from a neighboring plane of existence. Though the gith fought fiercely, they were no match for the psionic might of the mind flayers, and soon they were enslaved. The River of Angry Souls is a remnant of one of the terrible battles between the illithids and the soon-to- be enslaved gith. Many were brought to the Outer Planes and elsewhere to serve as illithid slaves. Other cities in Zarum were transformed into work pits where illithid overseers forced their slaves to toil for countless generations. After Gith's rebellion, she led her people to the Astral Plane. While a few subject races and surviving illithids remained on Oerth, the gith forerunners have departed the world, seemingly for good. If they retain any interest in the ruins of Zarum, it is well concealed. A portion of the ruins of Anithor were eventually colonized by the drow of House Kilsek, who named their new settlement Kalan-G'eld. Activities Currently, the illithids are in a period of intense study and experimentation, gathering knowledge of all sorts that will enable them to eventually reconquer the universe and hold it for good. They frequently meddle in the politics of other races through subtle psychic manipulation of key figures, not to cause chaos but so as to better understand the dynamics of civilization. They regularly probe the minds of surface dwellers so as to gather intelligence and learn about new advances in magic and technology. They also do a good deal of research themselves, mainly focused on developing new psychic powers. Illithids regularly conduct raids on all sentient settlements to acquire new thralls, because their existing stock of sentient thralls do not breed fast enough to satisfy their food and labor needs. Typically, a group of mind flayers will teleport to the settlement and swiftly incapacitate them with their psychic powers. The captives will then be marched all the way to the illithids' underground settlement by specially trained and conditioned thralls. Great care is taken to cover their tracks. Society An illithid city is ruled by a creature called an Elder Brain which lives in a pool of cerebral fluid in the city's center. When an illithid dies its brain is extracted and taken to the pool. Illithids believe that when they die their personality is incorporated into the Elder Brain, but this is not the case. When the brain of an illithid is added to the Elder Brain, the memories, thoughts and experiences are consumed and added to the sum of the whole, but all else is lost. This fact is a closely guarded secret of the Elder Brains, since all illithid aspire to a form of immortality through this merging process. An extremely ancient Elder Brain is called a God-Brain because its psionic powers are almost limitless. Since the Elder Brain contains the essence of every illithid that died in its community, it functions in part as a vast library of knowledge that a mind flayer can call upon with a simple telepathic call. The Elder Brain in turn can communicate telepathically with anyone in its community, issuing orders and ensuring everyone conforms. Illithids generally frown upon magic, preferring their natural psionic ability. Psionic potential is an integral part of the illithid identity, and the Elder Brain cannot absorb the magical powers of an illithid mage when it dies. They tolerate a limited study of wizardry, if only to better understand the powers employed by their enemies. However, an illithid who goes too far and neglects his psionic development in favor of wizardry risks becoming an outcast. Denied the possibility of ever merging with the Elder Brain, such outcasts often seek their own immortality through undeath, becoming alhoons. Illithids typically communicate through psychic means. They project thoughts and feelings to each other in a way non-illithids can scarcely comprehend. When they do feel the need to write, they do so in \\"qualith.\\" Instead of typical alphabet-based writing, illithids write in qualith by making marks consisting of four broken lines. They use each tentacle to feel the breaks in the lines, making it basically similar to braille. However, qualith is extremely complex, as each line modifies the preceding lines through explaining abstract concepts associated with the above words in ways no human can understand; only by understanding all four lines simultaneously can the meaning be understood properly. Religion Traditionally illithids revere a perverse deity named Ilsensine. In 2nd edition, they have a second deity named Maanzecorian, who is later killed by Tenebrous (Orcus) in the Planescape adventure module Dead Gods. Although Ilsensine is the illithid patron deity, few mind flayers actively worship it, thinking themselves the most powerful creatures in the universe. Relations with other races Illithids seek to rebuild their former empire wherein all other species were their slaves, so they view any sentient creature as worthy only of being their slaves or their food. They are pragmatic, however, and will trade with other races, such as dark elves and gray dwarves, who are too strong to be conquered. They also trade with the Neogi in order to obtain slaves. Their archenemies are the githyanki and the githzerai, descendants of the rebellious slaves who destroyed their empire millennia ago. Hunting and slaying illithids whenever they can is an integral part of their cultures. Illithids fear the undead because these creatures, even the sentient ones, are immune to telepathic detection and manipulation, and have no brains to consume. Confronting such mindless creatures can even be traumatizing to some of them. According to the Lords of Madness history, Illithids are one of the few races respected by the aboleths. This is because the aboleths remember the origin of almost every other race, through their hereditary memory. However, illithids, as far the aboleths can remember, just appeared without preamble, which scares them. In various campaign settings =In Eberron= In Eberron, the illithid come from Xoriat, the plane of Madness. They were created by the Daelkyr in their invasion plans. It is not known if they have elder brains, but their continued existence implies that they can breed on their own. The mind flayers of Eberron are resistant to damage from all weapons except those made out of byeshk, a new exotic material in the Eberron setting. =In Greyhawk= Illithids typically dwell in dim, underground settlements, usually in the Underdark. Perhaps the best-known illithid settlement on Oerth is the city of Dra-Mur-Shou, located within several miles of the Vault of the Drow. A number of illithids also make their home in the drow city of Erelhei-Cinlu, due to the presence of a well-known mind flayer research center. Greyspace Illithids also have a strong presence in Greyspace and spheres beyond. The primary spelljamming ship used by illithids is the nautiloid, a 35-ton craft resembling a nautilus. Nautiloids are 125' to 180' long, including the tentacle-like piercing ram. The ship's coiled shell provides the comfort of enclosed space and protects the illithids from the rays of solar bodies. Less common illithid vessels such as the 25-ton squid ship, the 70-ton octopus, and the 100-ton cuttle command also resemble the cephalopods after which they are named. In Greyspace, the largest illithid settlements are the city of Sharpbeak on Celene and the settlement of Skullbringer in the Grinder. Worlds ruled by illithids in other spheres include Falx, Ssirik Akuar, Penumbra, and Glyth. =In Ravenloft= Illithids are the rulers of a domain in the Ravenloft campaign setting called Bluetspur, where their God-Brain is the darklord. How and why this particular Illithid elder-brain became a darklord has never been revealed in any official Ravenloft products. =In Spelljammer= According to Ken Rolston, the beholder and the mind flayer \\"win starring roles as intergalactic menaces\\" in Spelljammer, describing the mind flayers as \\"evil, brain-sucking horrors who have polished up their social skills sufficiently to present a dubiously neutral facade to trading partners as they secretly scheme toward the day when all intelligent races will be their vassals and brain-food\\". Mind Flayers are one of the primary factions in the Spelljammer campaign setting. While less prominent than the neogi, illithids are in complete control of Glyth, a Realmspace planet, and have been for millennia. Illithids' primary ship type is the nautiloid, a 35-ton craft resembling a nautilus. Nautiloids are 125', or 180' long including the tentacle-like piercing ram. The ships' coiled shell provides the comfort of enclosed space and protects the illithids from solar radiation. Less common illithid vessels such as the 25-ton squidship, the 70-ton octopus, and the 100-ton cuttle command also resemble the cephalopods after which they are named. In the Spelljammer setting, the illithids are the creators of the oortlings, a humanoid race of high intelligence and enlarged size. Bred as food, the oortlings are completely docile and have little motivation and almost no instinct for self-preservation. Critical reception The mind flayer was ranked fourth among the ten best mid-level monsters by the authors of Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies. They referred to this unique creation of the D&D; game as the \\"quintessential evil genius\\" and the \\"perfect evil overlord\\". The Stranger writer Cienna Madrid described the Mind Flayer as one of D&D;'s \\"ghastly fiends\\". Rob Bricken from io9 named the mind flayer as the 9th most memorable D&D; monster. SyFy Wire in 2018 called it one of \\"The 9 Scariest, Most Unforgettable Monsters From Dungeons & Dragons\\", saying that \\"Mind flayers are another classic monster like the beholder.\\" Screen Rant compiled a list of the game's \\"10 Most Powerful (And 10 Weakest) Monsters, Ranked\\" in 2018, calling the elder brain one of the strongest, saying that the 5th edition version \\"still represents a grave threat to most adventuring parties, thanks to its range of powerful enchantment spells and psionic attacks, but it isn't quite the epic level threat that it once was.\\" In other media Mind flayers appear in other role-playing games, including Angband, Bloodborne, Demon's Souls, Final Fantasy, NetHack, Lost Kingdoms, Kingdom of Loathing and Lost Souls, and the one-player gamebook RPG series Fighting Fantasy includes a creature similar to the illithid, the Brain Slayer. Ulchalothe in Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II is the guardian of the Brazier of Eternal Flame. There are illithid settlements of varying size in the games Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark, Baldur's Gate II and Icewind Dale II. The villain in the Neverwinter Nights premium module 'Kingmaker' is also an Illithid. In Planescape: Torment, the player character may uncover a history of the illithids as they relate to the githzerai and the githyanki through studying the rings of the Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon in Dak'kon's possession. In episode 30 of the webcomic \\"Order of the Stick\\" (written by Rich Burlew), the party bard Elan encounters an illithid in its lair. The illithid opts not to consume Elan's brain due to the bard's stupidity, and so they start playing Scrabble instead. Episode 31 makes a reference to the illithid's preferred diet. Episode 32 makes a fourth-wall reference to the fact that the illithid isn't open source material. In the Final Fantasy series, players encounter an enemy called the Mindflayer, a cave-dwelling magic user that has the head of a squid, wears a flowing robe, and wields a staff. When the first game for the NES was brought to North America it was referred to as a Sorcerer.Final Fantasy Compendium Although the Mindflayer's name and appearance have been kept the same, the \\"Beholder\\" was changed to Evil Eye. The Netflix series Stranger Things, following the eighth episode of the second season, used the name \\"Mind Flayer\\" to refer to the main antagonist of the series due to their similar natures.

The Church of the SubGenius is a parody religion that satirizes better-known belief systems. It teaches a complex philosophy that focuses on J. R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs, purportedly a salesman from the 1950s, who is revered as a prophet by the Church. SubGenius leaders have developed detailed narratives about Dobbs and his relationship to various gods and conspiracies. Their central deity, Jehovah 1, is accompanied by other gods drawn from ancient myth and popular fiction. SubGenius literature describes a grand conspiracy that seeks to brainwash the world and oppress Dobbs's followers. In its narratives, the Church presents a blend of cultural references in an elaborate remix of the sources. Ivan Stang, who co- founded the Church in the 1970s, serves as its leader and publicist. He has imitated actions of other religious leaders, using the tactic of culture jamming in an attempt to undermine better-known faiths. Church leaders instruct their followers to avoid mainstream commercialism and the belief in absolute truths. The group holds that the quality of \\"Slack\\" is of utmost importance, but it is never clearly defined. The number of followers is unknown, although the Church's message has been welcomed by college students and artists in the United States. The group is often compared to Discordianism. Journalists often consider the Church an elaborate joke, but some academics have defended it as a real system of deeply held beliefs. Origins The Church of the SubGenius was founded by Ivan Stang (born Douglas St Clair Smith) and Philo Drummond (born Steve Wilcox) as the SubGenius Foundation. Dr. X (born Monte Dhooge) was also present at the group's inception. The organization's first recorded activity was the publication of a photocopied document, Sub Genius Pamphlet #1, disseminated in Dallas, Texas in 1979. The document announced the impending end of the world and the possible deaths of its readers. It criticized Christian conceptions of God and New Age perceptions of spirituality. Church leaders maintain that a man named J. R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs founded the group in 1953. SubGenius members constructed an elaborate account of Dobbs's life, which commentators describe as fictional. They assert that he telepathically contacted Drummond in 1972, before meeting him in person the next year, and that Drummond persuaded Stang to join shortly afterward. Stang has called himself Dobbs's \\"sacred scribe\\" and a \\"professional maven of weirdness\\". Beliefs =Deities= The Church of the SubGenius's ostensible beliefs defy categorization or a simple narrative, often striking outsiders as bizarre and convoluted. The group has an intricate mythology involving gods, aliens, and mutants, which observers usually consider satire of other religions. Its primary deity, generally known as Jehovah 1, is an extraterrestrial who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television. Jehovah 1 gave him supernatural knowledge of the past and future, in addition to incredible power. Dobbs then posed deep questions to the alien, receiving mysterious answers. Some of their discussion centered on a powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world. Jehovah 1 and his spouse Eris, regarded by the Church as \\"relatively evil\\", are classified as \\"rebel gods\\". SubGenius leaders note that Jehovah 1 is wrathful, a quality expressed by his \\"stark fist of removal\\". The Church teaches that they are part of the Elder Gods, who are committed to human pain, but that Jehovah 1 is \\"relatively good\\" in comparison. Yog- Sothoth, a character from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, is the Elder Gods' leader. In her 2010 study of the Church of the SubGenius, religious scholar Carole Cusack of the University of Sydney states that Lovecraft's work is a \\"model for the Church of the SubGenius's approach to scripture\\", in that aspects of his fiction were treated as real by some within paganism, just as the Church appropriates aspects of popular culture in its spirituality. =J. R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs= Fictional character Ward Cleaver (right), to whom Dobbs' appearance is often compared. SubGenius leaders teach that Dobbs's nature is ineffable and consequently stylize his name with quotation marks. They call him a \\"World Avatar\\" and hold that he has died and been reborn many times. The Church's primary symbol is an icon of his face in which he smokes a pipe. Stang has said the image was taken from Yellow Pages clip art, and it has been likened to Ward Cleaver, Mark Trail, or a 1950s-era salesman. The Church's canon contains references to aspects of United States culture in that decade; religious scholar Danielle Kirby of RMIT University argues that this type of reference \\"simultaneously critiques and subverts\\" the American dream. In the Church's mythology, Jehovah 1 intended Dobbs to lead a powerful conspiracy and brainwash individuals to make them work for a living. Dobbs refused; instead, he infiltrated the group and organized a counter-movement. Church leaders teach that he was a very intelligent child and, as he grew older, studied several religious traditions, including Sufism, Rosicrucianism, and the Fourth Way. Another key event in his life occurred when he traveled to Tibet, where he learned vital truths about topics including Yetis; the Church teaches that SubGenius members are descended from them. The only relative of Dobbs the Church identifies is his mother, Jane McBride Dobbs‚ÄîChurch leaders cite his lack of resemblance to his mother's husband as the reason for not revealing his father. Dobbs is married to a woman named Connie; SubGenius leaders identify the couple as archetypes of the genders in a belief that resembles Hindu doctrines about Shiva and Parvati. Church literature has variously described Dobbs's occupation as \\"drilling equipment\\" or fluoride sales, and accounts of his life generally emphasize his good fortune rather than intelligence. SubGenius leaders believe he is capable of time travel, and that this results in occasional changes to doctrine (the \\"Sacred Doctrine of Erasability\\"). Consequently, members attempt to follow Dobbs by eschewing unchangeable plans. =Conspiracy and \\"Slack\\"= The Church of the SubGenius's literature incorporates many aspects of conspiracy theories, teaching that there is a grand conspiracy at the root of all lesser ones. It says that there are many UFOs, most of which are used by the conspiracy leaders to monitor humans, though a few contain extraterrestrials. In the Church's view, this conspiracy uses a fa√ßade of empowering messages but manipulates people so that they become indoctrinated into its service. The Church calls these individuals \\"pinks\\" and states that they are blissfully unaware of the organization's power and control. SubGenius leaders teach that most cultural and religious mores are the conspiracy's propaganda. They maintain that their followers, but not the pinks, are capable of developing an imagination; the Church teaches that Dobbs has empowered its members to see through these illusions. Owing to their descent from Yetis, the Church's followers have a capacity for deep understanding that the pinks lack. Cultural studies scholar Solomon Davidoff states that the Church develops a \\"satiric commentary\\" on religion, morality, and conspiracies. SubGenius members believe that those in the service of the conspiracy seek to bar them from \\"Slack\\", a quality promoted by the Church. Its teachings center on \\"Slack\\" (always capitalized), which is never concisely defined, though Dobbs is said to embody it. Church members seek to acquire Slack and believe it will allow them the free, comfortable life (without hard work or responsibility) they claim as an entitlement. Sex and the avoidance of work are taught as two key ways to gain Slack. Davidoff believes that Slack is \\"the ability to effortlessly achieve your goals\\". Cusack states that the Church's description of Slack as ineffable recalls the way that Tao is described, and Kirby calls Slack a \\"unique magical system\\". Members R. Crumb, a cartoonist who helped publicize the Church. The Church of the SubGenius's founders were based in Dallas when they distributed their first document. The SubGenius Foundation moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1999. In 2009, Stang claimed the Church had 40,000 members, but the actual number may have been much lower. As of 2012, becoming a minister in the Church consists of paying a $35 fee; Stang has estimated that there are 10,000 ministers and that the Church's annual income has reached $100,000. In October 2017, The Church moved to Glen Rose, Texas. Most SubGenius members are male, and, according to Stang, many are social outcasts. He maintains that those who do not fit into society will ultimately triumph over those who do. The Church has experienced success \\"converting\\" college students, particularly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has also gained popularity in several American cities, including San Francisco, Little Rock, and Cleveland. A few Church members have voiced concerns and/or amusement about new members who took the Church too seriously, fearing that they acted like serious cult followers, the very concept the SubGenius parodies. Stang has expressed concern that the Church's doctrines could exacerbate preexisting psychoses of mentally ill devotees, although he believes that the Church genuinely helps many adherents. Notable associates of the Church include Mark Mothersbaugh, Mojo Nixon, Paul Mavrides, Paul Reubens, members of Negativland, David Byrne, and R. Crumb. Crumb provided early publicity for the church by reprinting Sub Genius Pamphlet #1 in his comics anthology Weirdo. References to the Church are present in several works of art, including the Internet-based collaborative fiction Ong's Hat, the comic book The Middleman, the band Sublime's album 40oz. to Freedom, and the television program Pee-wee's Playhouse. =Instructions= Church leaders have issued specific instructions to their followers; Robert Latham of the University of California, Riverside, calls their ideology \\"anarcholibertarian\\". Five specific commands particularly embody the group's values: *Shun regular employment and stop working. This encapsulates the Church's view that to repent is to \\"SLACK OFF\\", as opposed to working for a living. SubGenius leaders say it is permissible for members to collect public assistance in lieu of maintaining employment. *Purchase products sold by the Church, which its leaders say Dobbs founded to gain wealth. Unlike most religious groups, the Church proudly admits it is for- profit (presumably mocking religious groups that seem to have ulterior financial motives). Cusack sees the instruction to buy as an ironic parody of the \\"greed is good\\" mentality of the 1980s, and Kirby notes that although the group emphasizes \\"the consumption of popular cultural artefacts\\", this consumption is \\"simultaneously de-emphasized by the processes of remix\\". *Rebel against \\"law and order\\". Specifically, the Church condemns security cameras and encourages computer hacking. Cusack notes that this instruction recalls Robert Anton Wilson's critique of law and order. *Rid the world of everyone who did not descend from Yetis. SubGenius leaders teach that Dobbs hopes to rid the Earth of 90% of humanity, making the Earth \\"clear\\". The group praises drug abuse and abortion as effective methods of culling unneeded individuals. *Exploit fear, specifically that of people who are part of the conspiracy. Church leaders teach conspiracy members fear SubGenius devotees. Events =Devivals= Klaatu, a character from the 1951 American science fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still, who is celebrated by the Church of the SubGenius. Local groups of members of the Church of the SubGenius are known as \\"clenches\\". They host periodic events known as \\"devivals\\", which include sermons, music, and other art forms. The term is used by both the Church of the Subgenius and Discordianism for a gathering or festival of followers. The name is a pun on Christian revivals. At devivals, leaders take comical names and give angry rants. Many take place at bars or similar venues. Cusack compares the style of the services to Pentecostal revivalism; David Giffels of the Akron Beacon Journal calls them \\"campy preaching sessions\\". Cusack posits that these events are examples of Peter Lamborn Wilson's concept of Temporary Autonomous Zones, spaces in which the ordinary constraints of social control are suspended. On one occasion, the presence of a Church leader's wife at a SubGenius meeting that included public nudity and a goat costume contributed to her losing custody of her children in a court case. But the publicity surrounding the event was a boon to the Church's recruitment efforts. The Church also celebrates several holidays in honor of characters from fiction and popular culture, such as Monty Python, Dracula, and Klaatu. The Association for Consciousness Exploration and pagan groups have occasionally assisted the Church in its events. Some SubGenius members put little emphasis on meetings, citing the Church's focus on individualism, though the Book of the SubGenius discusses community. SubGenius devivals are not regularly scheduled, but are recorded on the SubGenius website. Devivals have been held in multiple U.S. states, as well as China, the Netherlands, and Germany. The Church has also held Devivals at non-SubGenius events, such as Burning Man and the Starwood Festival. Rev. Ivan Stang of the Church of the SubGenius at The Cyclone of Slack The Cyclone of Slack was a devival in Portland, Oregon, in October 2009 put on by the Church of the Subgenius and the organizers of Esozone. One of its more bizarre moments was when the alcohol and fire-and-brimstone sermon-fueled crowd in front of the stage began to sit down in twos and threes when the Duke of Uke began to play his ukulele. The \\"Go Fuck Yourself\\" devival was held in Astoria, New York, in October 2010 by the Church of the Subgenius at the Wonderland Collective. =X-Day= In early SubGenius literature, July 5, 1998, was introduced as a significant date, later becoming known as \\"X-Day\\". The Church held that Dobbs identified the date's significance in the 1950s, claiming that the world was to experience a massive change on that date when Xists, beings from Planet X, would arrive on Earth. SubGenius leaders said their paying members would be transported onto spaceships for union with goddesses as the world was destroyed, though a few posited that they would be sent to a joyful hell. In anticipation of the event, X-Day \\"drills\\" were held in 1996 and 1997. In July 1998, the Church held a large devival at a \\"clothing-optional\\" campground in Sherman, New York, attended by about 400 members. The event was ostensibly to celebrate the coming of aliens. When their appearance was not detected using the technology available at the time, Stang speculated that they might arrive in 8661, an inversion of 1998; this has been interpreted as a satire of the way that religious groups have revised prophecies after their failures. Some critics have dismissed the event as a prank or \\"performance art\\". Another theory is that The Conspiracy has lied about what year the present year actually is (just as they have lied about everything else), so that the liberation date would seem to pass without fulfillment and cause followers to lose faith. As a precaution, SubGenius members continue to gather for X-Day every July 5. At these events, the non-appearance of the aliens is celebrated. Cusack calls the productions carnivalesque or an echo of ancient Greek satyr plays. Publishing = Online = The Church of the SubGenius established a website in May 1993, and its members were very active on Usenet in the 1990s. = Print = Although it has gained a significant online presence, it was successful before the advent of Internet communities. The Church was a pioneer in the religious use of zines; Cusack notes that its use of the medium can be seen as a rejection of the alienation of labor practices. The SubGenius Foundation has published several official teachings, as well as non-doctrinal works by Stang. The Book of the SubGenius, which discusses Slack at length, was published by Simon & Schuster and sold 30,000 copies in its first five years in print. Kirby calls it a \\"call to arms for the forces of absurdity\\". Its juxtaposition, visual style, and content mirror the group as a whole. It draws themes from fiction as well as established and new religions, parodying a number of topics, including the Church of the SubGenius itself. A number of SubGenius members have written stories to build their mythology, which have been compiled and published. Their core texts are disordered, presented in the style of a collage. Kirby notes that the group's texts are a bricolage of cultural artifacts remixed into a new creation. In this process, Kirby argues, they interweave and juxtapose a variety of concepts, which she calls a \\"web of references\\". = Video = The group has also been promoted by a video Stang produced in 1992. = Radio = The Church of the SubGenius hosts several radio shows throughout the world, including broadcasters in Atlanta, Ohio, Maryland, and California. Several radio stations in the United States and two in Canada broadcast The Hour of Slack, the Church‚Äôs most popular audio production. = Podcast = The Hour of Slack can also be heard in podcast form. Analysis and commentary =Comparative religion= The Church's teachings are often perceived as satirizing Christianity and Scientology, earning them a reputation as a parody religion. Church leaders have said that Dobbs met L. Ron Hubbard, and SubGenius narratives echo extraterrestrial themes found in Scientology. Cusack notes Jehovah 1 bears noticeable similarities to Xenu, a powerful alien found in some Scientologist writings. The Church's rhetoric has also been seen as a satirical imitation of the televangelism of the 1980s. Cusack sees the Church's faux commercialism as culture jamming targeting prosperity theology, calling it \\"a strikingly original innovation in contemporary religion\\". Religious scholar Thomas Alberts of the University of London views the Church as attempting to \\"subvert the idea of authenticity in religion\\" by mirroring other religions to create a sense of both similarity and alterity. Cusack compares the Church of the SubGenius to the Ranters, a radical 17th-century pantheist movement in England that made statements that shocked many hearers, attacking traditional notions of religious orthodoxy and political authority. In her view, this demonstrates that the Church of the SubGenius has \\"legitimate pedigree in the history of Western religion\\". The American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight likens the Church to the Moorish Orthodox Church of America, a 20th-century American syncretic religious movement, citing their shared emphasis on freedom. There are a number of similarities between the Church of the SubGenius and Discordianism. Eris, the goddess of chaos worshiped by adherents of the latter, is believed by members of the Church of the SubGenius to be Jehovah 1's wife and an ally to humans. Like Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius rejects absolute truth and embraces contradictions and paradoxes. Religious scholar David Chidester of the University of Cape Town views the Church as a \\"Discordian offshoot\\", and Kirby sees it as \\"a child of the Discordians\\". Both groups were heavily influenced by the writings of Robert Anton Wilson, whom SubGenius members call \\"Pope Bob\\". Kirby states that the two groups have elements of bricolage and absurdity in common, but the Church of the SubGenius more explicitly remixes pop culture. =Categorization= Scholars often have difficulty defining the Church. Most commentators have placed the Church in the category of \\"joke religions\\", which is usually seen as pejorative. Kirby sees this categorization as partially accurate because irony is an essential aspect of the faith. Other terms used to describe the Church include \\"faux cult\\", \\"[postmodern] cult\\", \\"satirical pseudoreligion\\", \\"sophisticated joke religion\\", \\"anti-religion religion\\", and \\"high parody of cultdom\\". Members of the Church, however, have consistently maintained that they practice a religion. Stang has described the group as both \\"satire and a real stupid religion\\", and contends that it is more honest about its nature than are other religions. Cusack states that the Church \\"must be accorded the status of a functional equivalent of religion, at the very least, if not 'authentic' religion\\". She sees it as \\"arguably a legitimate path to liberation\\", citing its culture jamming and activism against commercialism. Kirby posits that the Church is a religion masquerading as a joke, rather than the reverse: in her view, it is a spiritual manifestation of a cultural shift toward irony. Alberts believes there is broad agreement that the Church is fundamentally a different type of group than religions that date to antiquity; he prefers to use the term \\"fake religion\\" to describe it. He sees it, along with Discordianism, as part of a group of \\"popular movements that look and feel like religion, but whose apparent excess, irreverence and arbitrariness seem to mock religion\\". Knight characterizes the Church as \\"at once a postmodern spoof of religion and a viable system in its own right\\". =Appraisal= Kirby argues that the Church forms a counterpart to Jean Baudrillard's concept of hyperreality, arguing, \\"they create, rather than consume, popular culture in the practice of their spirituality\\". She calls their remixing of popular culture sources an \\"explicitly creative process\\", maintaining that it prompts the reader to adopt some of the group's views by forcing \\"the individual to reconsider normative methods of approaching the content\\". She states that the group attempts to \\"strip references of their original meaning without necessarily losing their status as icons\\". Kirby also sees the Church's goal as deconstructing \\"normative modes of thought and behavior\\" in American culture; she believes that it attempts to fight culturally ingrained thought patterns by shocking people. She argues that traditional approaches to religion cast seriousness as a measure of devotion, an approach she believes has failed in contemporary society. She feels that irony is a common value that most religions have ignored. By embracing the quality, she maintains, the Church of the SubGenius offers a more accessible worldview than many groups. Literature scholar Paul Mann of Pomona College is critical of the Church of the SubGenius. He notes that the Church purports to present the truth through absurdity and faults it for insufficiently examining the concept of truth itself. In addition, he believes that the group undermines its attempts to take a radical perspective with its \\"hysterical, literal, fantastic embrace\\" of criticism. Anarchist writer Bob Black, a former member, has criticized the Church, alleging that it has become conformist and submissive to authority. He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cultlike behavior also appeared in the newspaper Bedfordshire on Sunday after a spate of SubGenius-themed vandalism struck the English town of Bedford.

Much of its architecture dates from Norman times. It ceased to be an abbey following its dissolution in the 16th century and became a cathedral in 1877. Although legally a cathedral church, it differs in certain particulars from most other cathedrals in England: it is also used as a parish church, of which the dean is rector with the same powers, responsibilities and duties as that of any other parish. At 85 metres long, it has the longest nave of any cathedral in England. Probably founded in the 8th century, the present building is Norman or Romanesque architecture of the 11th century, with Gothic and 19th-century additions. Britain's first Christian martyr According to Bede, whose account of the saint's life is the most elaborate, Alban lived in Verulamium, some time during the 3rd or 4th centuries. At that time Christians began to suffer \\"cruel persecution.\\" The legend proceeds with Alban meeting a Christian priest (known as Amphibalus) fleeing from \\"persecutors,\\" and sheltering him in his house for a number of days. Alban was so impressed with the priest's faith and piety that he soon converted to Christianity. Eventually Roman soldiers came to seize the priest, but Alban put on his cloak and presented himself to the soldiers in place of his guest. Alban was brought before a judge and was sentenced to beheading. As he was led to execution, he came to a fast flowing river, commonly believed to be the River Ver), crossed it and went about 500 paces to a gently sloping hill overlooking a beautiful plain When he reached the summit he began to thirst and prayed that God would give him drink, whereupon water sprang up at his feet. It was at this place that his head was struck off. Immediately after one of the executioners delivered the fatal stroke, his eyes fell out and dropped to the ground alongside Alban's head. Later versions of the tale say that Alban's head rolled downhill and that a well gushed up where it stopped. St Albans Cathedral stands near the supposed site of Alban's martyrdom, and references to the spontaneous well are extant in local place names. The nearby river was called Halywell (Middle English for 'Holy Well') in the medieval era, and the road up to Holmhurst Hill on which the Abbey now stands is now called Holywell Hill but has been called Halliwell Street and other variations at least since the 13th century. The remains of a well structure have been found at the bottom of Holywell Hill. However, this well is thought to date from no earlier than the 19th century. The date of Alban's execution has never been firmly established. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle lists the year 283, but Bede places it in 305. Original sources and modern historians such as William Hugh Clifford Frend and Charles Thomas indicate the period of 251‚Äì259 (under the persecutors Decius or Valerian) as more likely. The tomb of St Amphibalus is in the cathedral. History of the abbey and cathedral Remains of the cathedral's cloisters. A memoria over the execution point holding the remains of Alban existed at the site from the mid-4th century (possibly earlier); Bede mentions a church and Gildas a shrine. Bishop Germanus of Auxerre visited in 429. The style of this structure is unknown; the 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris (see below) claimed that the Saxons destroyed the building in 586. =Saxon buildings= Offa II of Mercia, is said to have founded a double monastery at St Albans in 793. It followed the Benedictine rule. The Abbey was built on Holmhurst Hill ‚Äî now Holywell Hill ‚Äî across the River Ver from the ruins of Verulamium. Again there is no information to the form of the first abbey. The Abbey was probably sacked by the Danes around 890 and, despite Paris's claims, the office of abbot remained empty from around 920 until the 970s when the efforts of Dunstan reached the town. There was an intention to rebuild the Abbey in 1005 when Abbot Ealdred was licensed to remove building material from Verulamium. With the town resting on clay and chalk the only tough stone is flint. This was used with a lime mortar and then either plastered over or left bare. With the great quantities of brick, tile and other stone in Verulamium, the Roman site became a prime source of building material for the Abbey and other projects in the area. Sections demanding worked stone used Lincolnshire limestone (Barnack stone) from Verulamium; later worked stones include Totternhoe freestone from Bedfordshire, Purbeck marble, and different limestones (Ancaster, Chilmark, Clipsham, etc.). Renewed Viking raids from 1016 stalled the Saxon efforts and very little from the Saxon abbey was incorporated in the later forms. The nave. The north wall (left) features a mix of Norman arches dating back to 1077 and arches in the Early English style of 1200.St Albans Cathedral, Jarrold Publishing, , p. 9 =Norman abbey= Much of the current layout and proportions of the structure date from the first Norman abbot, Paul of Caen (1077‚Äì1093). The 14th abbot, he was appointed by his uncle, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc. Building work started in the year of Abbot Paul's arrival. The design and construction was overseen by the Norman Robert the Mason. The plan has very limited Anglo-Saxon elements and is clearly influenced by the French work at Cluny, Bernay and Caen, and shares a similar floor plan to Saint-√âtienne and Lanfranc's Canterbury ‚Äî although the poorer quality building material was a new challenge for Robert and he clearly borrowed some Roman techniques, which were learned while gathering material in Verulamium. To take maximum use of the hilltop the Abbey was oriented to the south-east. The cruciform abbey was the largest built in England at that time, it had a chancel of four bays, a transept containing seven apses, and a nave of ten bays ‚Äî fifteen bays long overall. Robert gave particular attention to solid foundations, running a continuous wall of layered bricks, flints and mortar below and pushing the foundations down to twelve feet to hit bedrock. Below the crossing tower special large stones were used. The tower was a particular triumph ‚Äî it is the only 11th-century great crossing tower still standing in England. Robert began with special thick supporting walls and four massive brick piers. The four- level tower tapers at each stage with clasping buttresses on the three lower levels and circular buttresses on the fourth stage. The entire structure masses 5,000 tons and is 144 feet high. The tower was probably topped with a Norman pyramidal roof; the current roof is flat. The original ringing chamber had five bells ‚Äî two paid for by the Abbot, two by a wealthy townsman, and one donated by the rector of Hoddesdon. None of these bells has survived. There was a widespread belief that the Abbey had two additional, smaller towers at the west end. No remains have been found. The monastic abbey was completed in 1089 but not consecrated until Holy Innocents' Day, 1115, (28 Dec) by the Archbishop of Rouen. King Henry I attended as did many bishops and nobles. A nunnery (Sopwell Priory) was founded nearby in 1140. Internally the Abbey was bare of sculpture, almost stark. The plaster walls were coloured and patterned in parts, with extensive tapestries adding colour. Sculptural decoration was added, mainly ornaments, as it became more fashionable in the 12th century ‚Äî especially after the Gothic style arrived in England around 1170. In the current structure the original Norman arches survive principally under the central tower and on the north side of the nave. The arches in the rest of the building are Gothic, following medieval rebuilding and extensions, and Victorian era restoration. The Abbey was extended in the 1190s by Abbot John de Cella (also known as John of Wallingford) (1195‚Äì1214); as the number of monks grew from fifty to over a hundred, the Abbey church was extended westwards with three bays added to the nave. The severe Norman west front was also rebuilt by Hugh de Goldclif ‚Äî although how is uncertain; it was very costly but its 'rapid' weathering and later alterations have erased all but fragments. A more prominent shrine and altar to Saint Amphibalus were also added. The work was very slow under de Cella and was not completed until the time of Abbot William de Trumpington (1214‚Äì35). The low Norman tower roof was demolished and a new, much higher, broached spire was raised, sheathed in lead. The St Albans Psalter (ca. 1130‚Äì45) is the best known of a number of important Romanesque illuminated manuscripts produced in the Abbey scriptorium. Later, Matthew Paris, a monk at St Albans from 1217 until his death in 1259, was important both as a chronicler and an artist. Eighteen of his manuscripts survive and are a rich source of contemporary information for historians. Nicholas Breakspear was born near St Albans and applied to be admitted to the Abbey as a novice, but he was turned down. He eventually managed to be accepted into an abbey in France. In 1154 he was elected Pope Adrian IV, the only English Pope there has ever been. The head of the Abbey was confirmed as the premier abbot in England also in 1154. The Abbey had a number of daughter houses, ranging from Tynemouth Priory in the north to Binham Priory near the Norfolk coast.Mee, Arthur Mee.

Painting: Joan Freeman An earthquake shook the Abbey in 1250 and damaged the eastern end of the church. In 1257 the dangerously cracked sections were knocked down ‚Äî three apses and two bays. The thick Presbytery wall supporting the tower was left. The rebuilding and updating was completed during the rule of Abbot Roger de Norton (1263‚Äì90). On 10 October 1323 two piers on the south side of the nave collapsed dragging down much of the roof and wrecking five bays. Mason Henry Wy undertook the rebuilding, matching the Early English style of the rest of the bays but adding distinctly 14th-century detailing and ornaments. The shrine to St Amphibalus had also been damaged and it was remade. St Albans School. Ruins of Richard Lee's house at Sopwell Priory Richard of Wallingford, abbot from 1297 to 1336 and a mathematician and astronomer, designed a celebrated clock, which was completed by William of Walsham after his death, but apparently destroyed during the reformation. A new gateway, now called the Abbey Gateway, was built to the Abbey grounds in 1365, which was the only part of the monastery buildings (besides the church) to survive the dissolution, later being used as a prison and now (since 1871) part of St Albans School. The other monastic buildings were located to the south of the gateway and church. In the 15th century a large west window of nine main lights and a deep traced head was commissioned by John of Wheathampstead. The spire was reduced to a 'Hertfordshire spike', the roof pitch greatly reduced and battlements liberally added. Further new windows, at ¬£50 each, were put in the transepts by Abbot Wallingford (also known as William of Wallingford), who also had a new high altar screen made. =Dissolution and after= After the death of Abbot Ramryge in 1521 the Abbey fell into debt and slow decay under three weak abbots. At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and its surrender on 5 December 1539 the income was ¬£2,100 annually. The abbot and remaining forty monks were pensioned off and then the buildings were looted. All gold, silver and gilt objects were carted away with all other valuables; stonework was broken and defaced and graves opened to burn the contents. The Abbey became part of the diocese of Lincoln in 1542 and was moved to the diocese of London in 1550. The buildings suffered ‚Äî neglect, second-rate repairs, even active damage. Richard Lee purchased all the buildings, except the church and chapel and some other Crown premises, in 1550. Lee then began the systematic demolition for building material to improve Lee Hall at Sopwell. In 1551, with the stone removed, Lee returned the land to the abbot. The area was named Abbey Ruins for the next 200 years or so. In 1553 the Lady chapel was used as a school, the Great Gatehouse as a town jail, some other buildings passed to the Crown, and the Abbey Church was sold to the town for ¬£400 in 1553 by King Edward VI to be the church of the parish. The cost of upkeep fell upon the town, although in 1596 and at irregular intervals later the Archdeacon was allowed to collect money for repairs by Brief in the diocese. After James I visited in 1612 he authorised another Brief, which collected around ¬£2,000 ‚Äî most of which went on roof repairs. The English Civil War slashed the monies spent on repairs, while the Abbey Church was used to hold prisoners of war and suffered from their vandalism, as well as that of their guards. Most of the metal objects that had survived the Dissolution were also removed and other ornamental parts were damaged in Puritan sternness. Another round of fund-raising in 1681‚Äì84 was again spent on the roof, repairing the Presbytery vault. A royal grant from William III and Mary II in 1689 went on general maintenance, 'repairs' to conceal some of the then considered unfashionable Gothic features, and on new internal fittings. There was a second royal grant from William in 1698. By the end of the 17th century the dilapidation was sufficient for a number of writers to comment upon it. In 1703, from 26 November to 1 December, the Great Storm raged across southern England; the Abbey lost the south transept window which was replaced in wood at a cost of ¬£40. The window was clear glass with five lights and three transoms in an early Gothic Revival style by John Hawgood. Other windows, although not damaged in the storm, were a constant drain on the Abbey budget in the 18th century. A brief written in 1723‚Äì24, seeking ¬£5,775, notes a great crack in the south wall, that the north wall was eighteen inches from vertical, and that the roof timbers were decayed to the point of danger. The money raised was spent on the nave roof over ten bays. Another brief was not issued until 1764. Again the roof was rotting, as was the south transept window, walls were cracked or shattered in part and the south wall had subsided and now leant outwards. Despite a target of ¬£2,500 a mere ¬£600 was raised. In the 1770s the Abbey came close to demolition; the expense of repairs meant a scheme to destroy the Abbey and erect a smaller church almost succeeded. A storm in 1797 caused some subsidence, cracking open graves, scattering pavement tiles, flooding the church interior and leaving a few more arches off-vertical. =19th century= Victorian replacements (1884‚Äì89) of the originals, destroyed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when the screen itself was also damaged.The Cathedral Church of Saint Albans, Thomas Perkins, 205, p.21 Statues of St Alban and St Amphibalus stand on either side of the altar. This century was marked with a number of repair schemes. The Abbey received some money from the 1818 \\"Million Act\\", and in 1820, ¬£450 was raised to buy an organ ‚Äî a second-hand example made in 1670. The major efforts to revive the Abbey Church came under four men ‚Äî L. N. Cottingham, H. J. B. Nicholson (Rector), and, especially, George Gilbert Scott and Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe. In February 1832 a portion of the clerestory wall fell through the roof of the south aisle, leaving a hole almost thirty feet long. With the need for serious repair work evident, the architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham was called in to survey the building. His Survey was presented in 1832 and was worrying reading: everywhere mortar was in a wretched condition and wooden beams were rotting and twisting. Cottingham recommended new beams throughout the roof and a new steeper pitch, removal of the spire and new timbers in the tower, new paving, ironwork to hold the west transept wall up, a new stone south transept window, new buttresses, a new drainage system for the roof, new ironwork on almost all the windows, and on and on. He estimated a cost of ¬£14,000. A public subscription of ¬£4,000 was raised, of which ¬£1,700 vanished in expenses. With the limited funds the clerestory wall was rebuilt, the nave roof re-leaded, the tower spike removed, some forty blocked windows reopened and glazed, and the south window remade in stone. Henry Nicholson, rector from 1835 to 1866, was also active in repairing the Abbey Church ‚Äî as far as he could, and in uncovering lost or neglected Gothic features. In 1856 repair efforts began again; ¬£4,000 was raised and slow moves started to gain the Abbey the status of cathedral. George Gilbert Scott was appointed the project architect and oversaw a number of works from 1860 until his death in 1878. The choir Scott began by having the medieval floor restored, necessitating the removal of tons of earth, and fixing the north aisle roof. From 1872 to 1877 the restored floors were re-tiled in matching stone and copies of old tile designs. A further 2,000 tons of earth were shifted in 1863 during work on the foundation and a new drainage system. In 1870 the tower piers were found to be badly weakened with many cracks and cavities. Huge timbers were inserted and the arches filled with brick as an emergency measure. Repair work took until May 1871 and cost over ¬£2,000. The south wall of the nave was now far from straight; Scott reinforced the north wall and put in scaffolding to take the weight of the roof off the wall, then had it jacked straight in under three hours. The wall was then buttressed with five huge new masses and set right. Scott was lauded as \\"saviour of the Abbey.\\" From 1870 to 1875 around ¬£20,000 was spent on the Abbey. In 1845 St Albans was transferred from the Diocese of Lincoln to the Diocese of Rochester. Then, in 1875, the Bishopric of St Albans Act was passed and on 30 April 1877 the See of St Albans was created, which comprises about 300 churches in the counties of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. Thomas Legh Claughton, then Bishop of Rochester, elected to take the northern division of his old diocese and on 12 June 1877 was enthroned first Bishop of St Albans, a position he held until 1890. He is buried in the churchyard on the north side of the nave. George Gilbert Scott was working on the nave roof, vaulting and west bay when he died on 27 March 1878. His plans were partially completed by his son, John Oldrid Scott, but the remaining work fell into the hands of Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe, whose efforts have attracted much controversy ‚Äî Nikolaus Pevsner calling him a \\"pompous, righteous bully.\\" However, he donated much of the immense sum of ¬£130,000 the work cost. Whereas Scott's work had clearly been in sympathy with the existing building, Grimthorpe's plans reflected the Victorian ideal. Indeed, he spent considerable time dismissing and criticising the work of Scott and the efforts of his son. Grimthorpe first reinstated the original pitch of the roof, although the battlements added for the lower roof were retained. Completed in 1879, the roof was leaded, following on Scott's desires. 1805 engraving of the west front of the Abbey showing the lost Wheathampstead window. His second major project was the most controversial. The west front, with the great Wheathampstead window, was cracked and leaning, and Grimthorpe, never more than an amateur architect, designed the new front himself ‚Äî attacked as dense, misproportioned and unsympathetic: \\"His impoverishment as a designer ... [is] evident\\"; \\"this man, so practical and ingenious, was utterly devoid of taste ... his great qualities were marred by arrogance ... and a lack of historic sense\\". Counter proposals were deliberately substituted by Grimthorpe for poorly drawn versions and Grimthorpe's design was accepted. During building it was considerably reworked in order to fit the actual frontage and is not improved by the poor quality sculpture. Work began in 1880 and was completed in April 1883, having cost ¬£20,000. The Lady Chapel at the east end of the cathedral Grimthorpe was noted for his aversion to the Perpendicular ‚Äî to the extent that he would have sections he disliked demolished as \\"too rotten\\" rather than remade. In his reconstruction, especially of windows, he commonly mixed architectural styles carelessly (see the south aisle, the south choir screen and vaulting). He spent ¬£50,000 remaking the nave. Elsewhere he completely rebuilt the south wall cloisters, with new heavy buttresses, and removed the arcading of the east cloisters during rebuilding the south transept walls. In the south transept he completely remade the south face, completed in 1885, including the huge lancet window group ‚Äî his proudest achievement ‚Äî and the flanking turrets; a weighty new tiled roof was also made. In the north transept Grimthorpe had the Perpendicular window demolished and his design inserted ‚Äî a rose window of circles, cusped circles and lozenges arrayed in five rings around the central light, sixty-four lights in total, each circle with a different glazing pattern. Grimthorpe continued through the Presbytery in his own style, adapting the antechapel for Consistory Courts, and into the Lady Chapel. After a pointed lawsuit with Henry Hucks Gibbs, 1st Baron Aldenham, over who should direct the restoration, Grimthorpe had the vault remade and reproportioned in stone, made the floor in black and white marble (1893), and had new Victorian arcading and sculpture put below the canopy work. Externally the buttresses were expanded to support the new roof, and the walls were refaced. As early as 1897, Grimthorpe was having to return to previously renovated sections to make repairs. His use of over-strong cement led to cracking, while his fondness for ironwork in windows led to corrosion and damage to the surrounding stone. Grimthorpe died in 1905 and was interred in the churchyard. He left a bequest for continuing work on the buildings. During this century the name St Albans Abbey was given to one of the town's two railway stations. =20th century= John Oldrid Scott (died 1913) (George Gilbert Scott's son), despite frequent clashes with Grimthorpe, had continued working within the cathedral. Scott was a steadfast supporter of the Gothic revival and designed the tomb of the first bishop; he had a new bishop's throne built (1903), together with commemorative stalls for Festing (a bishop) and two archdeacons, and new choir stalls. He also repositioned and rebuilt the organ (1907). Further work was interrupted by the war. A number of memorials to the war were added to the cathedral, notably the painting The Passing of Eleanor by Frank Salisbury (stolen 1973) and the reglazing of the main west window, dedicated in 1925. Following the Enabling Act of 1919, control of the buildings passed to a Parochial Church Council (replaced by the Cathedral Council in 1968), who appointed the woodwork specialist John Rogers as Architect and Surveyor of the Fabric. He uncovered extensive death watch beetle damage in the presbytery vault and oversaw the repair (1930‚Äì31). He had four tons of rubbish removed from the crossing tower and the main timbers reinforced (1931‚Äì32), and invested in the extensive use of insecticide throughout the wood structures. In 1934, the eight bells were overhauled and four new bells added to be used in the celebration of George V's silver jubilee. The shrine of St Alban. Cecil Brown was architect and surveyor from 1939 to 1962. At first he merely oversaw the lowering of the bells for the war and established a fire watch, with the pump in the slype. After the war, in the 1950s, the organ was removed, rebuilt and reinstalled and new pews added. His major work was on the crossing tower. Grimthorpe's cement was found to be damaging the Roman bricks: every brick in the tower was replaced as needed and reset in proper mortar by one man, Walter Barrett. The tower ceiling was renovated as were the nave murals. Brown established the Muniments Room to gather and hold all the church documents. In 1972, to encourage a closer link between celebrant and congregation in the nave, the massive nine-ton pulpit along with the choir stalls and permanent pews was dismantled and removed. The altar space was enlarged and improved. New 'lighter' wood (limed oak) choir stalls were put in, and chairs replaced the pews. A new wooden pulpit was acquired from a Norfolk church and installed in 1974. External floodlighting was added in 1975. A major survey in 1974 revealed new leaks, decay and other deterioration, and a ten-year restoration plan was agreed. Again the roofing required much work. The nave and clerestory roofs were repaired in four stages with new leading. The nave project was completed in 1984 at a total cost of ¬£1.75 million. The clerestory windows were repaired with the corroded iron replaced with delta bronze and other Grimthorpe work on the clerestory was replaced. Seventy-two new heads for the corbel table were made. Grimthorpe's west front was cracking, again due to the use originally of too strong a mortar, and was repaired. A new visitors' centre was proposed in 1970. Planning permission was sought in 1973; there was a public inquiry and approval was granted in 1977. Constructed to the south side of the cathedral, close to the site of the original chapter house of the Abbey, the new 'Chapter House' cost around ¬£1 million and was officially opened on 8 June 1982 by Queen Elizabeth. The main building material was 500,000 replica Roman bricks. Other late 20th-century works include the restoration of Alban's shrine, with a new embroidered canopy, and the stained glass designed by Alan Younger for Grimthorpe's north transept rose window,Alan Younger : Obituary in The Daily Telegraph, 2004-06-08 unveiled in 1989 by Diana, Princess of Wales. In 2015 seven new painted stone statues by Rory Young were installed in the medieval niches in the nave screen. This was a rare occurrence as the last painted figures placed in a church screen were put there before the Reformation and the English civil war. Modern times The bishop of St Albans is Alan Smith, installed in September 2009. Jonathan Smith is Archdeacon of St Albans, installed in October 2008. On 2 July 2004, Jeffrey John became the ninth dean of the cathedral. Robert Runcie, later Archbishop of Canterbury, was Bishop of St Albans from 1970 to 1980 and returned to live in the city after his retirement; he is commemorated by a gargoyle on the cathedral as well as being buried in the graveyard. Colin Slee, former dean of Southwark Cathedral, was sub-dean at St Albans under Runcie and the then dean, Peter Moore. The bishop's residence, Abbey Gate House, is in Abbey Mill Lane, St Albans, as is the house of the bishop of Hertford. Eric James, Chaplain Extraordinary to the Queen, was canon at St Albans for many years.

The earliest known name of an organist at St Albans is Adam from the early 13th century. Robert Fayrfax, the prominent English Renaissance composer, is recorded as being organist from 1498 to 1502, and was buried there following his death some 20 years later. Since 1820 the post of organist and master of the music has been held by a number of well- known musicians, including Peter Hurford, Stephen Darlington and Barry Rose. The current master of the music, since 1998, is Andrew Lucas.Andrew Lucas (St Albans Bach Choir) The assistant master of music at the cathedral is sometimes also the master of music at St Albans School ‚Äî for example, Simon Lindley and Andrew Parnell. Since 1963 the cathedral has been home to the St Albans International Organ Festival, founded by Peter Hurford, and winners of which include Dame Gillian Weir, Thomas Trotter and Naji Hakim. = Bells = In total, there are 23 bells housed in the tower. The main ring of 12 bells (with a sharp 2nd) was cast in 2010 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. These replaced the previous ring, 8 of which still remain in the tower and are used for the clock chime and carillon; the carillon plays a different tune every day of the week. In the 17th century the cathedral housed a ring of 5 bells, until they were recast and augmented to 6 in 1699. In 1731 the bells were augmented to a ring of 8 by adding two new bells. Finally, in 2010 the 13 new bells were cast, and were rung for the first time at Easter 2011. The oldest bell in the tower was cast in c.1290 and is still used today as the sanctus bell.

R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs J. R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs is the figurehead of the parody religion The Church of the SubGenius. His image is derived from a piece of 1950s clip art. According to SubGenius dogma, \\"Bob\\" was a drilling equipment salesman who, in 1953, saw a vision of the god JHVH-1 on a television set he had built. The vision inspired him to write the \\"PreScriptures\\" (as described in the Book of the SubGenius) and found the Church. The theology holds that \\"Bob\\" is the greatest salesman who ever lived, and has cheated death a number of times. He is also revered for his great follies and believed to be a savior of \\"Slack\\". He was assassinated in San Francisco in 1984, though the Church claims that he has come back from the dead several times since then. The quotation marks in \\"Bob's\\" name are always included when spelling his name, according to the Church. Personal history According to Revelation X; The \\"Bob\\" Apocryphon, \\"Bob\\" was born in Dallas, Texas, to Xinucha-Chi-Xan M. Dobbs (a pharmacist) and Jane McBride Dobbs. At an early age, he possessed a talent for making large amounts of money by playing the stock market over the telephone. He married his wife Connie in Las Vegas in 1955 and worked as a photographer's model while inventing and patenting novelty gag items. In 1957, he worked weekends doing Evangelical Christian preaching \\"strictly for the money\\". Robert Anton Wilson's short story \\"The Horror on Howth Hill\\" involves a conversation between Dobbs and the mad scientist De Selby. Connie Dobbs Connie Dobbs, the Blessed Anti-Virgin Constance \\"Connie\\" Marsh Dobbs, the wife of \\"Bob\\", has become nearly as legendary in SubGenius circles as \\"Bob\\". Although \\"Bob\\" has been married to other women, spirits, deities, and inanimate objects, Connie is described in the SubGenius documentary Arise! as \\"his first, and still his primary wife.\\" Connie is the patron of SubGenius women, and she is seen as a vision of true liberation for women. She refuses to submit to anyone (especially \\"Bob\\"), and she is just as free-wheeling and promiscuous as her husband, although she has a more level head on her shoulders when it comes to domestic issues. Dobbstown According to Church lore, \\"Bob\\" travelled to Sarawak, Malaysia, and founded his headquarters, a secret enclave there, called Dobbstown, where he often stays. Images of \\"Bob\\" This 1956 image bears similarity to the one created later depicting Dobbs. \\"Bobs image first appeared in the original SubGenius publication, SubGenius Pamphlet #1 (a.k.a. \\"The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die\\") (1979). Since his initial appearance, his face has appeared in numerous places around the world, and it has made cameo appearances on everything from graffiti art on highway overpasses and as part of the graphical character set of the Atari ST operating system, to musical albums by many underground bands (and several popular mainstream rock bands, ranging from Devo to Sublime) and the occasional film (The Wizard of Speed and Time), TV show (Pee-wee's Playhouse) and cartoon (SpongeBob SquarePants). There are also two German comics with \\"Bob\\" (\\"Future Subjunkies\\" and \\"Space Bastards\\", both by Gerhard Seyfried and Ziska Riemann). The Church of the SubGenius maintains the trademark and copyright on \\"Bobs image, though it has tried to avoid taking legal action unless absolutely necessary. \\"Bobs image is commonly seen on the Usenet newsgroup alt.binaries.slack, where he appears regularly in images by many artists. Proper etiquette on the newsgroup dictates that credit be given where it is due, and acknowledgement of the ownership of \\"Bobs image by the Church is accepted by the regular newsgroup participants. J.R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs served as the inspiration for the character of Professor Utonium in the cartoon The Powerpuff Girls. The DC Comics character Doc Magnus also bears a strong visual resemblance to \\"Bob.\\" Sacred Ikon Around 2002, the Church adopted a new symbol called the \\"Sacred Ikon\\", which is a stylized cross consisting of three bars and a pipe, placed in a pattern that matches the eyes, nose, mouth, and pipe of \\"Bobs image.

Founded in 1876 as a co-educational school, it was originally the first college started by members of the Church of the Brethren as a center for vocational learning for those who could not afford formal education. Today, Juniata has about 1,600 students from 42 states and territories and 45 countries. History Martin Grove BrumbaughThe Huntingdon Normal School was established by a spry young Huntingdon physician, Dr. Andrew B. Brumbaugh, and his two cousins, Henry and John Brumbaugh. Henry provided a second-story room over his local print shop for classes, while John lodged and fed the college's first teacher, Jacob M. Zuck. Andrew was to \\"provide students and furniture\\". Juniata's first classes were held on April 17, 1876 with Zuck teaching Rebecca Cornelius, Maggie D. Miller, and Gaius M. Brumbaugh, the only son of Andrew Brumbaugh. In 1877, the school changed its name to \\"Brethren Normal School.\\" At this time Zuck also discussed adding a \\"Scientific Course\\" and issuing \\"Certificates of Graduation\\". In 1879, classes moved into Founder's Hall, the school's first permanent building on the present-day campus then only known as \\"The Building\\". On May 11 of same year, Jacob Zuck died from pneumonia at age 32 when he insisted on sleeping in the then unfinished Founders Hall without a heater. James Quinter was than chosen to lead the school as the school's first president. The college was renamed \\"Juniata College\\" in 1894 for the nearby Juniata River, one of the principal tributaries of the Susquehanna River, due to a ruling at the Brethren Church's Annual Meeting against using the term \\"Brethren\\" in naming a school. The name Juniata College was made the schools legal name in 1896. In 1895, Dr. Martin Grove Brumbaugh, an 1881 graduate from Brethren Normal (Huntingdon Normal), took over the active presidency of Juniata until 1910. During and after his tenure, Brumbaugh remained intimately connected to the college and reacquired the college's presidency in 1924, after having served as governor of Pennsylvania from 1915 to 1919 and as commissioner of education to Puerto Rico in 1900. M. G. Brumbaugh died unexpectedly in 1930 while on vacation in Pinehurst, North Carolina and was succeeded in his presidency by a former pupil at Juniata, Dr. Charles Calvert Ellis. =Presidents= * James Quinter (1879‚Äì1888) * H.B.

Two new buildings since 2000 include the von Liebig Center for Science and the Suzanne von Liebig Theatre. Founders Hall, the first building on campus, has also been renovated recently. Construction was finished in the summer of 2009 and uses underground geothermal energy to heat and cool the building. This building is recognized as a LEED Gold building. Nathan Hall The newest building project on campus is Nathan Hall, a dormitory named in honor of longtime Juniata employee, Hilda Nathan. Hilda worked in the treasurer's office from 1946 to 1976. The new residence hall, which opened to students for the fall 2014 semester, offers significant improvements in the areas of accessibility, community and sustainability. Nathan Hall has an elevator and is designed for accessibility throughout the building. The space also is designed to foster community with features such as informal gathering spaces and lounges within the building and outside.Carnegie Hall The dorm also was constructed using \\"green\\" technologies such as geothermal heating, energy-efficient lighting, plantings and green spaces. The building also offers a bike shelter to encourage less driving. Other off-campus sites include the Baker Peace Chapel (designed by Maya Lin) and the \\"cliffs,\\" which has views of the Juniata River. The college also owns the Raystown Field Station, a 365-acre (1.48 km2) reserve on Raystown Lake, which includes an LEED Gold building and two lodges for semester-long residential programs, often focused on environmental topics. Carnegie Hall was completed in 1907, paid for in part by a grant from U.S. Steel magnate Andrew Carnegie and served as a library for Juniata until 1963, when the college's current L.A. Beeghly Library was completed. The Museum houses a permanent collection, which includes works from the Hudson River School, American portrait miniatures, as well as Old Master paintings and prints. The Museum hosts regional, national, and international exhibitions. Academics =Program of emphasis= Juniata College features a \\"Program of Emphasis\\" rather than the common Academic major. Within a certain course framework, students choose and create their own Program of Emphasis and graduate with a degree in it. There are designated Programs of Emphasis that follow a set of courses (e.g. Environmental Science, Communication and Anthropology, etc.) or students may create their own with the approval of two faculty advisors. =Areas of study= Juniata is a liberal arts institution. It has programs in a variety of areas, from the natural sciences to the arts, social sciences, and humanities. Many students who enter Juniata for the strong science programs, however, find that they enjoy world culture, international programs, peace studies, politics, or a variety of other disciplines. This varied combination allows students to explore different facets of the world. The school has a 79% graduation rate; of those, 96% do so within four years. Juniata also has a 95% acceptance rate to all postgraduate programs, including medical, podiatric, dental, occupational therapy, physical therapy, chiropractic, and law schools. Since 2003, Juniata has produced eight Academic All-Americans, five American Physiological Society Undergraduate Research Fellows, 20 Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholars, 19 Fulbright Scholars, 14 Goldwater Fellows, one Pickering Fellow, eight St. Andrew's Society Scholars, and one Davies-Jackson Scholar. Juniata also perennially places at least one student as a Harvard Summer Research Scholar. Nearly forty-five percent of Juniata students design their own program of emphasis, and Juniata offers study-abroad opportunities in 22 countries on 6 continents. =Rankings= Juniata College ranks 82 in National Liberal Arts Colleges and 61 in Best Value Schools by U.S.News, ranks 36th in the 2014 Washington Monthly Best Bang for the Buck. Juniata College has also been selected by the 2015 Princeton Review as one of the Best 379 Colleges, and has been mentioned in the following publications: Loren Pope's Colleges That Change Lives; Kaplan, Inc.'s Insider's Guide to the 328 Most Interesting Colleges; Peterson's Competitive Colleges; Miriam Weinstein's Making A Difference College Guide: Outstanding Colleges to Help You Make a Better World; Barron's Best Buys in College Education; Leland Miles' Provoking Thought: What Colleges Should Do for Students; Elle Girl Magazine: Top 50 colleges that Dare to be Different; Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges; Don Asher's Cool Colleges, and the Fiske Guide to Colleges. Athletics Memorial Gymnasium inside the Kennedy Sports & Recreation Center Juniata is a Division III collegiate sports institution. It is well known for its volleyball program (Men's and Women's) and is also a charter member of the Landmark Conference. Juniata athletes compete in the Landmark Conference except for volleyball and football. The Juniata Men's Volleyball Team competes in the Continental Volleyball Conference (formerly it competed in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association winning several titles under, both, Division I and Division III sanctioning). The Juniata Eagles Football Squad is a member of the Centennial Conference. Juniata had a school record of five Academic All-Americans in 2004‚Äì2005 academic year and 55 All-American honors since 1998. In addition, \\"College Hill\\" sports 2 National Championships in Women's Volleyball (2004 & 2006). Men's Volleyball boasts one EIVA Championship as an NCAA Division I exception (1992) and 6 National Championships as a Division III powerhouse (1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 & 2009). The Goal Post Trophy goes to the winner of the annual football game with rival Susquehanna University. It is a section of the goal post that was torn down after the 1952 Juniata-Susquehanna game. The visiting Indians (now Eagles) upset the Crusaders in Selinsgrove, and Juniata fans tore down the goal post after the game. At roughly 5 feet tall, it is one of the tallest trophies in college football. Student life =Annual events= Juniata College has a tradition of campus-wide events dating back to its founding days. *Lobsterfest, Established: 1988  Lobsterfest is held at the end of the first week of classes and welcomes students back to campus after summer break. Lobsterfest is a picnic that features lobsters as the main course and live entertainment. In addition, the Student Organization Fair is held during Lobsterfest and gives new students the opportunity to see and sign up for campus clubs. Storming of the Arch 2014 *Storming of the Arch, Established: Mid-1940s  Storming of the Arch takes place on the second Thursday of fall semester and is optional for any new freshmen. Freshmen gather on the center of the campus quad with the intention of charging the Cloister Arch and making it through to the other side, a mission complicated by a group of upperclassmen - \\"defenders\\" of the Arch. Freshmen charge the Arch until they are all knocked down or someone gets through the gauntlet of upperclassmen. To date, only one student has made it through the Arch, a 2018 graduate, Blair Altland. Storming of the Arch was canceled in the mid-1990s due to the number of students being injured but was reinstated by several officers of the Men's rugby team who reorganized it as a charity event. *Mountain Day, Established: 1896  Mountain Day is the oldest tradition at Juniata and occurs on an unannounced fall day. The specific date of Mountain Day is not known to students nor faculty until the morning of the event; however, its possible date is a constant source of campus speculation. On Mountain day, all classes are canceled and both students and faculty are shuttled to Raystown Lake, a popular destination in the area. The day includes a picnic lunch, nature walks, crafts, music, swimming, boating, and a class vs. class tug-of-war.President Troha on a Slip n' Slide during Mountain Day 2014 *Homecoming Weekend, Established: 1923  Homecoming features alumni reunion activities, sporting events, and a class spirit competition. A unique aspect of Juniata's Homecoming celebration is the presentation of the Community Contribution Awards during half-time of the football game rather than having a Homecoming king and queen. The award recognizes students who have made outstanding community service contributions, both on-campus and in their local communities. *Family Weekend, Established: 1936  Usually occurring on a weekend in September, Family Weekend is a chance for students' parents and families to visit the campus. The weekend is filled with activities such as picnics, sporting events, cultural events, tours, etc. *Mr. Juniata Pageant, Established: 1997  Sponsored by Circle K, the Mr. Juniata Pageant is a tongue-in-cheek spoof of beauty pageants with men from each class competing for the coveted Mr. Juniata crown. The categories include take-offs of formal wear, talent-showing, and interviews.Mr. Juniata Pageant 2014 *Madrigal dinner, Established: 1970  Madrigal Dinner is one of the most popular traditions, with 600‚Äì700 students attending, and occurs on the last Saturday of fall semester. This holiday tradition starts with a meal served to the students by the faculty and staff of their choosing. After dinner, guests are entertained with performances by members of the campus community and the group participates in a holiday carol sing. This sing-along culminates with the singing of \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\" with various sections of the dining hall acting out the different parts of the song. Tickets for the sections are sold first-come, first-served and students camp out during the week(s) prior in order to acquire their desired section (the \\"Five Golden Rings\\" section is very popular). The Madrigal \\"line\\" is typically an elaborate tent city on the lawn around the campus center. It is tradition for some to play pranks on the \\"line.\\" These pranks in past years have included: blowing air horns throughout the night, water balloons, flooding the lawn where the tents are located, playing recorded animal sounds, and gluing tent zippers shut. *Pig Roast, Established: 1986  Pigroast is an annual barbecue held at Raystown Lake and is sponsored by the Men's rugby team with the support of the Women's Rugby team. This barbecue also serves as an opportunity for the men's rugby club to play a match against the alumni who return for the event.

The Place du Tertre is a square in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, France.

Place du Tertre was the heart of the prestigious Benedictine Montmartre Abbey, established in 1133 by King Louis VI. Montmartre Abbey thrived through the centuries and until the French revolution under the patronage of the Kings of France. Place du Tertre was opened to the public in 1635 as Montmartre village central square. From the end of the 18th century until World War One, the whole Montmartre Boheme could been seen here: painters, songwriters and poets. With its many artists setting up their easels each day for the tourists, the Place du Tertre is a reminder of the time when Montmartre was the mecca of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century, many painters including Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, and Maurice Utrillo were living there, some at the nearby Le Bateau-Lavoir.

He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best- known works are his Pavane,Faure, Gabriel. (1913). 'Gabriel Faure plays Pavane, Op. 50, 1913 Welte Mignon recording.'. YouTube. Requiem, Sicilienne, nocturnes for piano and the songs \\"Apr√®s un r√™ve\\" and \\"Clair de lune\\". Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Faur√© composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more harmonically and melodically complex style. Faur√© was born into a cultured but not especially musical family. His talent became clear when he was a small boy. At the age of nine, he was sent to the Ecole Niedermeyer music college in Paris, where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster. The Ecole Neidermeyer's pedagogy differed greatly from that of the Paris Conservatoire. Among his teachers was Camille Saint- Sa√´ns, who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, Faur√© earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the √âglise de la Madeleine and director of the Paris Conservatoire, he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, Faur√© was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed by the president of the French Republic. Outside France, Faur√©'s music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime. Faur√©'s music has been described as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Faur√©'s death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with the charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned. Biography =Early years= Faur√© was born in Pamiers, Ari√®ge, in the south of France, the fifth son and youngest of six children of Toussaint-Honor√© Faur√© (1810‚Äì85) and Marie-Antoinette-H√©l√®ne Lal√®ne-Laprade (1809‚Äì87).Duchen, p. 13 According to the biographer Jean-Michel Nectoux, the Faur√© family dates to the 13th century in that part of France.Nectoux (1991), p. 3 The family had at one time been substantial landowners, but by the 19th century its means had become reduced. The composer's paternal grandfather, Gabriel, was a butcher whose son became a schoolmaster.Duchen, p. 12 In 1829 Faur√©'s parents married. His mother was the daughter of a minor member of the nobility. He was the only one of the six children to display musical talent; his four brothers pursued careers in journalism, politics, the army and the civil service, and his sister had a traditional life as the wife of a public servant. The young Faur√© was sent to live with a foster mother until he was four years old.Nectoux (1991), p. 4 When his father was appointed director of the √âcole Normale d'Instituteurs, a teacher training college, at Montgauzy, near Foix, in 1849, Faur√© returned to live with his family.Duchen, p. 2 There was a chapel attached to the school, which Faur√© recalled in the last year of his life: Faur√© as a student, 1864 An old blind woman, who came to listen and give the boy advice, told his father of Faur√©'s gift for music. In 1853 Simon-Lucien Dufaur de Saubiac, of the National Assembly, heard Faur√© play and advised Toussaint-Honor√© to send him to the √âcole de Musique Classique et Religieuse (School of Classical and Religious Music), better known as the √âcole Niedermeyer de Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer was setting up in Paris.Nectoux (1991), p. 5 After reflecting for a year, Faur√©'s father agreed and took the nine-year-old boy to Paris in October 1854.Nectoux, Jean-Michel. \\"Faur√©, Gabriel (Urbain)\\", Grove Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 21 August 2010 Helped by a scholarship from the bishop of his home diocese, Faur√© boarded at the school for 11 years.Nectoux, p. 6 Niedermeyer, whose goal was to produce qualified organists and choirmasters, focused on church music. Faur√©'s tutors were Cl√©ment Loret for organ, Louis Dietsch for harmony, Xavier Wackenthaler for counterpoint and fugue, and Niedermeyer for piano, plainsong and composition. When Niedermeyer died in March 1861, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns took charge of piano studies and introduced contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner.Jones, p. 16 Faur√© recalled in old age, \\"After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our [program] of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life.\\"Faur√© in 1922, quoted in Nectoux (1984), pp. 1‚Äì2 Saint-Sa√´ns took great pleasure in his pupil's progress, which he helped whenever he could; Nectoux comments that at each step in Faur√©'s career \\"Saint-Sa√´ns's shadow can effectively be taken for granted.\\"Nectoux (1984), p. 2 The close friendship between them lasted until Saint-Sa√´ns died sixty years later.Copland, Aaron. \\"Gabriel Faur√©, a Neglected Master\\", The Musical Quarterly, October 1924, pp. 573‚Äì586 Faur√© won many prizes while at the school, including a premier prix in composition for the Cantique de Jean Racine, Op. 11, the earliest of his choral works to enter the regular repertory. He left the school in July 1865, as a Laureat in organ, piano, harmony and composition, with a Ma√Ætre de chapelle diploma.Nectoux (1991), p. 502; and Jones, p. 20 =Organist and composer= On leaving the √âcole Niedermeyer, Faur√© was appointed organist at the Church of Saint- Sauveur, at Rennes in Brittany. He took up the post in January 1866.Nectoux (1991), p. 12 During his four years at Rennes he supplemented his income by taking private pupils, giving \\"countless piano lessons\\".Nectoux (1991), p. 508 At Saint-Sa√´ns's regular prompting he continued to compose, but none of his works from this period survive.Nectoux (1991), p. 15 He was bored at Rennes and had an uneasy relationship with the parish priest, who correctly doubted Faur√©'s religious conviction. Faur√© was regularly seen stealing out during the sermon for a cigarette, and in early 1870, when he turned up to play at Mass one Sunday still in his evening clothes, having been out all night at a ball, he was asked to resign.Jones, p. 21 Almost immediately, with the discreet aid of Saint-Sa√´ns, he secured the post of assistant organist at the church of Notre-Dame de Clignancourt, in the north of Paris.Duchen, p. 28 He remained there for only a few months. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he volunteered for military service. He took part in the action to raise the Siege of Paris, and saw action at Le Bourget, Champigny and Cr√©teil.Nectoux (1991), p. 503 He was awarded a Croix de Guerre.Duchen, p. 31 Staff and students of the √âcole Niedermeyer, 1871. Faur√© in front row second from left; Andr√© Messager in middle row second from right After France's defeat by Prussia, there was a brief, bloody conflict within Paris from March to May 1871 during the Commune. Faur√© escaped to Rambouillet where one of his brothers lived, and then travelled to Switzerland, where he took up a teaching post at the √âcole Niedermeyer, which had temporarily relocated there to avoid the violence in Paris. His first pupil at the school was Andr√© Messager, who became a lifelong friend and occasional collaborator.Jones, p. 27 Faur√©'s compositions from this period did not overtly reflect the turmoil and bloodshed. Some of his colleagues, including Saint-Sa√´ns, Gounod and Franck, produced elegies and patriotic odes. Faur√© did not, but according to his biographer Jessica Duchen, his music acquired \\"a new sombreness, a dark-hued sense of tragedy ... evident mainly in his songs of this period including L'Absent, Seule! and La Chanson du p√™cheur.\\"Duchen, p. 32 When Faur√© returned to Paris in October 1871, he was appointed choirmaster at the √âglise Saint- Sulpice under the composer and organist Charles-Marie Widor. In the course of his duties, he wrote several canticles and motets, few of which have survived.Nectoux, p. 18 During some services, Widor and Faur√© improvised simultaneously at the church's two organs, trying to catch each other out with sudden changes of key. Faur√© regularly attended Saint-Sa√´ns's musical salons and those of Pauline Viardot, to whom Saint-Sa√´ns introduced him. Faur√© was a founding member of the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique, formed in February 1871 under the joint chairmanship of Romain Bussine and Saint-Sa√´ns, to promote new French music.Vallas, p. 135 Other members included Georges Bizet, Emmanuel Chabrier, Vincent d'Indy, Henri Duparc, C√©sar Franck, √âdouard Lalo and Jules Massenet.Jones, p. 28 and Grove Faur√© became secretary of the society in 1874. Many of his works were first presented at the society's concerts.Jones, p. 28 Faur√© in 1875 In 1874 Faur√© moved from Saint-Sulpice to the √âglise de la Madeleine, acting as deputy for the principal organist, Saint-Sa√´ns, during the latter's many absences on tour.Jones, p. 29 Some admirers of Faur√©'s music have expressed regret that although he played the organ professionally for four decades, he left no solo compositions for the instrument.See, for example, Henderson, A. M. \\"Memories of Some Distinguished French Organists ‚Äì Faur√©\\", The Musical Times, September 1937, pp. 817‚Äì819 and Orrey, Leslie. \\"Gabriel Faur√©, 1845‚Äì1924\\", The Musical Times, May 1945, pp. 137‚Äì139 He was renowned for his improvisations,Henderson, A. M. \\"Memories of Some Distinguished French Organists ‚Äì Faur√©\\", The Musical Times, September 1937, pp. 817‚Äì819 and Saint-Sa√´ns said of him that he was \\"a first class organist when he wanted to be\\".Nectoux (1991), p. 41 Faur√© preferred the piano to the organ, which he played only because it gave him a regular income. Duchen speculates that he positively disliked the organ, possibly because \\"for a composer of such delicacy of nuance, and such sensuality, the organ was simply not subtle enough.\\"Duchen, p. 17 The year 1877 was significant for Faur√©, both professionally and personally.Jones, p. 33 In January his first violin sonata was performed at a Soci√©t√© Nationale concert with great success, marking a turning-point in his composing career at the age of 31. Nectoux counts the work as the composer's first great masterpiece.Nectoux (1991), p. 80 In March, Saint-Sa√´ns retired from the Madeleine, succeeded as organist by Th√©odore Dubois, his choirmaster; Faur√© was appointed to take over from Dubois. In July Faur√© became engaged to Pauline Viardot's daughter Marianne, with whom he was deeply in love. To his great sorrow, she broke off the engagement in November 1877, for reasons that are not clear.Jones, p. 50 To distract Faur√©, Saint- Sa√´ns took him to Weimar and introduced him to Franz Liszt. This visit gave Faur√© a liking for foreign travel, which he indulged for the rest of his life. From 1878, he and Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw Das Rheingold and Die Walk√ºre at the Cologne Opera; the complete Ring cycle at the Hofoper in Munich and at Her Majesty's Theatre in London; and Die Meistersinger in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw Parsifal.Jones, p. 51 They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent Souvenirs de Bayreuth. This short, up-tempo piano work for four hands sends up themes from The Ring.Wagstaff, John and Andrew Lamb. \\"Messager, Andr√©\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 14 August 2010 Faur√© admired Wagner and had a detailed knowledge of his music,Nectoux (1991), p. 39 but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence. =Middle years= Painting of Gabriel Faur√© by John Singer Sargent, 1889 In 1883 Faur√© married Marie Fremiet, the daughter of a leading sculptor, Emmanuel Fremiet.Jones, p. 52 The marriage was affectionate, but Marie became resentful of Faur√©'s frequent absences, his dislike of domestic life ‚Äì \\"horreur du domicile\\" ‚Äì and his love affairs, while she remained at home. Though Faur√© valued Marie as a friend and confidante, writing to her often ‚Äì sometimes daily ‚Äì when away from home, she did not share his passionate nature, which found fulfilment elsewhere.Duchen, p. 66 Faur√© and his wife had two sons. The first, born in 1883, Emmanuel Faur√©- Fremiet (Marie insisted on combining her family name with Faur√©'s), became a biologist of international reputation.Willmer, E. N. \\"Emmanuel Faur√©-Fremiet, 1883‚Äì1971\\", Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, Vol. 18 (November 1972), pp. 187‚Äì221 The second son, Philippe, born in 1889, became a writer; his works included histories, plays, and biographies of his father and grandfather.\\"Philippe Faur√©-Fremiet\\", WorldCat, accessed 2 April 2012 Contemporary accounts agree that Faur√© was extremely attractive to women; in Duchen's phrase, \\"his conquests were legion in the Paris salons.\\"Duchen, Jessica. \\"A still, small voice\\", The Guardian, 24 November 1995, p. A12 After a romantic attachment to the singer Emma Bardac from around 1892,Nectoux (1991), p. 181 followed by another to the composer Adela Maddison,Orledge, pp. 16‚Äì17 in 1900 Faur√© met the pianist Marguerite Hasselmans, the daughter of Alphonse Hasselmans. This led to a relationship which lasted for the rest of Faur√©'s life. He maintained her in a Paris apartment, and she acted openly as his companion.Nectoux (1991), pp. 282‚Äì285 Faur√© and Marie in 1889 To support his family, Faur√© spent most of his time in running the daily services at the Madeleine and giving piano and harmony lessons.Duchen, p. 69 His compositions earned him a negligible amount, because his publisher bought them outright, paying him an average of 60 francs for a song, and Faur√© received no royalties.Nectoux (1991), p. 26 During this period, he wrote several large- scale works, in addition to many piano pieces and songs, but he destroyed most of them after a few performances, only retaining a few movements in order to re-use motifs. Among the works surviving from this period is the Requiem, begun in 1887 and revised and expanded, over the years, until its final version dating from 1901.Oliver, pp. 215‚Äì217 After its first performance, in 1888, the priest in charge told the composer, \\"We don't need these novelties: the Madeleine's repertoire is quite rich enough.\\"Duchen, p. 80 As a young man Faur√© had been very cheerful; a friend wrote of his \\"youthful, even somewhat child-like, mirth.\\"Jones, p. 31 From his thirties he suffered bouts of depression, which he described as \\"spleen\\", possibly first caused by his broken engagement and his lack of success as a composer. In 1890 a prestigious and remunerative commission to write an opera with lyrics by Paul Verlaine was aborted by the poet's drunken inability to deliver a libretto. Faur√© was plunged into so deep a depression that his friends were seriously concerned about his health.Duchen, pp. 95‚Äì97 Winnaretta de Scey-Montb√©liard, always a good friend to Faur√©, invited him to Venice, where she had a palazzo on the Grand Canal.Orledge, p. 14 He recovered his spirits and began to compose again, writing the first of his five M√©lodies de Venise, to words by Verlaine, whose poetry he continued to admire despite the operatic debacle.Orledge, p. 15; and Duchen, pp. 98‚Äì99 Emma Bardac About this time, or shortly afterwards, Faur√©'s liaison with Emma Bardac began; in Duchen's words, \\"for the first time, in his late forties, he experienced a fulfilling, passionate relationship which extended over several years\\".Duchen, p. 105 His principal biographers all agree that this affair inspired a burst of creativity and a new originality in his music, exemplified in the song cycle La bonne chanson.Duchen, p. 105; Johnson, p. 253; Jones, p. 68; Nectoux, p. 185; and Orledge, p. 15 Faur√© wrote the Dolly Suite for piano duet between 1894 and 1897 and dedicated it to Bardac's daughter H√©l√®ne, known as \\"Dolly\\". Some people suspected that Faur√© was Dolly's father, but biographers including Nectoux and Duchen think it unlikely. Faur√©'s affair with Emma Bardac is thought to have begun after Dolly was born, though there is no conclusive evidence either way.Nectoux, p. 181; and Duchen, p. 108 During the 1890s Faur√©'s fortunes improved. When Ernest Guiraud, professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire, died in 1892, Saint-Sa√´ns encouraged Faur√© to apply for the vacant post. The faculty of the Conservatoire regarded Faur√© as dangerously modern, and its head, Ambroise Thomas, blocked the appointment, declaring, \\"Faur√©? Never! If he's appointed, I resign.\\"Nectoux (1991), p. 224 However, Faur√© was appointed to another of Guiraud's posts, inspector of the music conservatories in the French provinces.Orledge, p. 15 He disliked the prolonged travelling around the country that the work entailed, but the post gave him a steady income and enabled him to give up teaching amateur pupils.Jones, p. 65 Saint-Sa√´ns, Thomas, Massenet, Dubois In 1896 Ambroise Thomas died, and Th√©odore Dubois took over as head of the Conservatoire. Faur√© succeeded Dubois as chief organist of the Madeleine. Dubois' move had further repercussions: Massenet, professor of composition at the Conservatoire, had expected to succeed Thomas, but had overplayed his hand by insisting on being appointed for life.Jones, p. 78 He was turned down, and when Dubois was appointed instead, Massenet resigned his professorship in fury.Nectoux (1984), pp. 224‚Äì225 Faur√© was appointed in his place.Orledge, p. 16 He taught many young composers, including Maurice Ravel, Florent Schmitt, Charles Koechlin, Louis Aubert, Jean Roger-Ducasse, George Enescu, Paul Ladmirault, Alfredo Casella and Nadia Boulanger. In Faur√©'s view, his students needed a firm grounding in the basic skills, which he was happy to delegate to his capable assistant Andr√© Gedalge.Nectoux (1991), p. 246 His own part came in helping them make use of these skills in the way that suited each student's talents. Roger-Ducasse later wrote, \\"Taking up whatever the pupils were working on, he would evoke the rules of the form at hand ... and refer to examples, always drawn from the masters.\\"Nectoux (1991), p. 307 Ravel always remembered Faur√©'s open-mindedness as a teacher. Having received Ravel's String Quartet with less than his usual enthusiasm, Faur√© asked to see the manuscript again a few days later, saying, \\"I could have been wrong\\".Nichols, p. 103 The musicologist Henry Pruni√®res wrote, \\"What Faur√© developed among his pupils was taste, harmonic sensibility, the love of pure lines, of unexpected and colorful modulations; but he never gave them [recipes] for composing according to his style and that is why they all sought and found their own paths in many different, and often opposed, directions.\\"Pruni√®res, Henry, quoted in Copland. (Copland spells the given name as \\"Henri\\" and uses the older English term \\"receipts\\" for \\"recipes\\".) Faur√©'s works of the last years of the century include incidental music for the English premiere of Maurice Maeterlinck's Pell√©as et M√©lisande (1898) and Prom√©th√©e, a lyric tragedy composed for the amphitheatre at B√©ziers. Written for outdoor performance, the work is scored for huge instrumental and vocal forces. Its premiere in August 1900 was a great success, and it was revived at B√©ziers the following year and in Paris in 1907. A version with orchestration for normal opera house-sized forces was given at the Paris Op√©ra in May 1917 and received more than forty performances in Paris thereafter. From 1903 to 1921, Faur√© regularly wrote music criticism for Le Figaro, a role in which he was not at ease. Nectoux writes that Faur√©'s natural kindness and broad-mindedness predisposed him to emphasise the positive aspects of a work. =Head of Paris Conservatoire= Maurice Ravel In 1905 a scandal erupted in French musical circles over the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome. Faur√©'s pupil Ravel had been eliminated prematurely in his sixth attempt for this award, and many believed that reactionary elements within the Conservatoire had played a part in it.Orledge, p. 21 Dubois, who became the subject of much censure, brought forward his retirement and stepped down at once.Nectoux, p. 267 Appointed in his place, and with the support of the French government, Faur√© radically changed the administration and curriculum. He appointed independent external judges to decide on admissions, examinations and competitions, a move which enraged faculty members who had given preferential treatment to their private pupils; feeling themselves deprived of a considerable extra income, many of them resigned.Woldu, Gail Hilson. \\"Gabriel Faur√©, directeur du Conservatoire: les r√©formes de 1905\\", Revue de Musicologie, T. 70e, No. 2e (1984), pp. 199‚Äì228, Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Musicologie. French text. Faur√© was dubbed \\"Robespierre\\" by disaffected members of the old guard as he modernised and broadened the range of music taught at the Conservatoire. As Nectoux puts it, \\"where Auber, Hal√©vy and especially Meyerbeer had reigned supreme ... it was now possible to sing an aria by Rameau or even some Wagner ‚Äì up to now a forbidden name within the Conservatoire's walls\\".Nectoux (1991), p. 269 The curriculum was broadened to range from Renaissance polyphony to the works of Debussy. Faur√©'s new position left him better off financially. However, while he also became much more widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling to earn a living as an organist and piano teacher.Jones, p. 110 As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition.Nectoux (1991), p. 270 His works from this period include his lyric opera, P√©n√©lope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'√àve, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9‚Äì11; Barcarolles Nos. 7‚Äì11, written between 1906 and 1914). Faur√© at the turn of the century Faur√© was elected to the Institut de France in 1909, after his father-in-law and Saint-Sa√´ns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor.Jones, p. 133 In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Soci√©t√© musicale ind√©pendante. While Faur√© accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Faur√© developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.Landormy, Paul and M. D. Herter. \\"Gabriel Faur√© (1845‚Äì1924)\\", The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 17, No. 3 (July 1931), pp. 293‚Äì301 The turn of the 20th century saw a rise in the popularity of Faur√©'s music in Britain, and to a lesser extent in Germany, Spain and Russia.Nectoux (1991), p. 278 He visited England frequently, and an invitation to play at Buckingham Palace in 1908 opened many other doors in London and beyond.Nectoux (1991), p. 283 He was in London for the premiere of Elgar's First Symphony in 1908 and dined with the composer.Moore, p. 547 Elgar later wrote to their mutual friend Frank Schuster that Faur√© \\"was such a real gentleman ‚Äì the highest kind of Frenchman and I admired him greatly.\\" Elgar tried to get Faur√©'s Requiem put on at the Three Choirs Festival, but it did not finally have its English premiere until 1937, nearly fifty years after its first performance in France.Anderson, p. 156 Composers from other countries also loved and admired Faur√©. In the 1880s Tchaikovsky had thought him \\"adorable\\";Anderson, Robert. \\"Review: Insights\\", The Musical Times, February 1985, pp. 93‚Äì94 Alb√©niz and Faur√© were friends and correspondents until the former's early death in 1909;Jones, p. 10 Richard Strauss sought his advice;Jones, pp. 124‚Äì125 and in Faur√©'s last years, the young American Aaron Copland was a devoted admirer. The outbreak of the First World War almost stranded Faur√© in Germany, where he had gone for his annual composing retreat. He managed to get from Germany into Switzerland, and thence to Paris.Jones, pp. 160‚Äì161 He remained in France for the duration of the war. When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Sa√´ns tried to organise a boycott of German music, Faur√© and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with Saint-Sa√´ns. Faur√© did not recognise nationalism in music, seeing in his art \\"a language belonging to a country so far above all others that it is dragged down when it has to express feelings or individual traits that belong to any particular nation.\\"Caballero, Carlo. \\"Review: Gabriel Faur√©: A Musical Life\\", 19th-Century Music, Vol. 16, No. 1 (Summer, 1992), pp. 85‚Äì92 Nonetheless, he was aware that his own music was respected rather than loved in Germany. In January 1905, visiting Frankfurt and Cologne for concerts of his music, he had written, \\"The criticisms of my music have been that it's a bit cold and too well brought up! There's no question about it, French and German are two different things.\\"Nectoux (1991), p. 277 =Last years and legacy= In 1920, at the age of 75, Faur√© retired from the Conservatoire because of his increasing deafness and frailty. In that year he received the Grand-Croix of the L√©gion d'honneur, an honour rare for a musician. In 1922 the president of the republic, Alexandre Millerand, led a public tribute to Faur√©, a national hommage, described in The Musical Times as \\"a splendid celebration at the Sorbonne, in which the most illustrious French artists participated, [which] brought him great joy. It was a poignant spectacle, indeed: that of a man present at a concert of his own works and able to hear not a single note. He sat gazing before him pensively, and, in spite of everything, grateful and content.\\" President Millerand are in the box between the statues Faur√© suffered from poor health in his later years, brought on in part by heavy smoking. Despite this, he remained available to young composers, including members of Les Six, most of whom were devoted to him. Nectoux writes, \\"In old age he attained a kind of serenity, without losing any of his remarkable spiritual vitality, but rather removed from the sensualism and the passion of the works he wrote between 1875 and 1895.\\" In his last months, Faur√© struggled to complete his String Quartet. Twenty years earlier he had been the dedicatee of Ravel's String Quartet. Ravel and others urged Faur√© to compose one of his own. He refused for many years, on the grounds that it was too difficult. When he finally decided to write it, he did so in trepidation, telling his wife, \\"I've started a Quartet for strings, without piano. This is a genre which Beethoven in particular made famous, and causes all those who are not Beethoven to be terrified of it.\\"Jones, p. 202 He worked on the piece for a year, finishing it on 11 September 1924, less than two months before he died, working long hours towards the end to complete it.Perreau, p. 3 The quartet was premiered after his death;Jones, p. 192 he declined an offer to have it performed privately for him in his last days, as his hearing had deteriorated to the point where musical sounds were horribly distorted in his ear.Nectoux, p. 292 Faur√© died in Paris from pneumonia on 4 November 1924 at the age of 79. He was given a state funeral at the √âglise de la Madeleine and is buried in the Passy Cemetery in Paris.Duchen, p. 212 After Faur√©'s death, the Conservatoire abandoned his radicalism and became resistant to new trends in music, with Faur√©'s own harmonic practice being held up as the farthest limit of modernity, beyond which students should not go. His successor, Henri Rabaud, director of the Conservatoire from 1922 to 1941, declared \\"modernism is the enemy\\".Nichols, Roger. \\"Henri Rabaud\\", BBC Music, accessed 1 April 2012 The generation of students born between the wars rejected this outdated premise, turning for inspiration to Bart√≥k, the Second Viennese School, and the latest works of Stravinsky.Nectoux (1991), p. 469 In a centenary tribute in 1945, the musicologist Leslie Orrey wrote in The Musical Times, \\"'More profound than Saint-Sa√´ns, more varied than Lalo, more spontaneous than d'Indy, more classic than Debussy, Gabriel Faur√© is the master par excellence of French music, 'the perfect mirror of our musical genius.' Perhaps, when English musicians get to know his work better, these words of Roger-Ducasse will seem, not over-praise, but no more than his due.\\" Orrey, Leslie.\\"Gabriel Faur√©, 1845‚Äì1924\\", The Musical Times, May 1945, pp. 137‚Äì139 Music Manuscript page of the Requiem Aaron Copland wrote that although Faur√©'s works can be divided into the usual \\"early\\", \\"middle\\" and \\"late\\" periods, there is no such radical difference between his first and last manners as is evident with many other composers. Copland found premonitions of late Faur√© in even the earliest works, and traces of the early Faur√© in the works of his old age: \\"The themes, harmonies, form, have remained essentially the same, but with each new work they have all become more fresh, more personal, more profound.\\" When Faur√© was born, Berlioz and Chopin were still composing; the latter was among Faur√©'s early influences.Orledge, p. 59; and Nectoux (1991), p. 48 In his later years Faur√© developed compositional techniques that foreshadowed the atonal music of Schoenberg,Nectoux (1991), p. 415 and, later still, drew discreetly on the techniques of jazz.Nectoux (1991), p. 401 Duchen writes that early works such as the Cantique de Jean Racine are in the tradition of French nineteenth- century romanticism, yet his late works are as modern as any of the works of his pupils.Duchen, p. 6 Influences on Faur√©, particularly in his early work, included not only Chopin but Mozart and Schumann. The authors of The Record Guide (1955), Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, wrote that Faur√© learnt restraint and beauty of surface from Mozart, tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin, \\"and from Schumann, the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound, and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated.\\"Sackville-West, pp. 263‚Äì264 His work was based on the strong understanding of harmonic structures that he gained at the √âcole Niedermeyer from Niedermeyer's successor Gustave Lef√®vre. Lef√®vre wrote the book Trait√© d'harmonie (Paris, 1889), in which he sets out a harmonic theory that differs significantly from the classical theory of Rameau, no longer outlawing certain chords as \\"dissonant\\". By using unresolved mild discords and colouristic effects, Faur√© anticipated the techniques of Impressionist composers. In contrast with his harmonic and melodic style, which pushed the bounds for his time, Faur√©'s rhythmic motives tended to be subtle and repetitive, with little to break the flow of the line, although he used discreet syncopations, similar to those found in Brahms's works. Copland referred to him as \\"the Brahms of France\\". The music critic Jerry Dubins suggests that Faur√© \\"represents the link between the late German Romanticism of Brahms ... and the French Impressionism of Debussy.\\"Dubins, Jerry. \\"Review\\", Fanfare, May 2006, pp. 245‚Äì246 To Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, Faur√©'s later works do not display the easy charm of his earlier music: \\"the luscious romantic harmony which had always been firmly supported by a single tonality, later gave way to a severely monochrome style, full of enharmonic shifts, and creating the impression of several tonal centres simultaneously employed.\\"Sackville-West, p. 264 =Vocal music= Faur√© is regarded as one of the masters of the French art song, or m√©lodie. Ravel wrote in 1922 that Faur√© had saved French music from the dominance of the German Lied.Ravel, p. 23 Two years later the critic Samuel Langford wrote of Faur√©, \\"More surely almost than any writer in the world he commanded the faculty to create a song all of a piece, and with a sustained intensity of mood which made it like a single thought\\".\\"Gabriel Faur√©\\", The Manchester Guardian, 5 November 1924, p. 16 In a 2011 article the pianist and writer Roy Howat and the musicologist Emily Kilpatrick wrote: In Copland's view, the early songs, written in the 1860s and 1870s under the influence of Gounod, except for isolated songs such as \\"Apr√®s un r√™ve\\" or \\"Au bord de l'eau\\", show little sign of the artist to come. With the second volume of the sixty collected songs written during the next two decades, Copland judged, came the first mature examples of \\"the real Faur√©\\". He instanced \\"Les berceaux\\", \\"Les roses d'Ispahan\\" and especially \\"Clair de lune\\" as \\"so beautiful, so perfect, that they have even penetrated to America\\", and drew attention to less well known m√©lodies such as \\"Le secret\\", \\"Nocturne\\", and \\"Les pr√©sents\\". Faur√© also composed a number of song cycles. Cinq m√©lodies \\"de Venise\\", Op. 58 (1891), was described by Faur√© as a novel kind of song suite, in its use of musical themes recurring over the cycle. For the later cycle La bonne chanson, Op. 61 (1894), there were five such themes, according to Faur√©.Orledge, pp. 78‚Äì81 He also wrote that La bonne chanson was his most spontaneous composition, with Emma Bardac singing back to him each day's newly written material. The Requiem, Op. 48, was not composed to the memory of a specific person but, in Faur√©'s words, \\"for the pleasure of it.\\" It was first performed in 1888. It has been described as \\"a lullaby of death\\" because of its predominantly gentle tone.Payne, Anthony, \\"Sweet lullaby of death\\", The Independent, 5 April 1997 Faur√© omitted the Dies irae, though reference to the day of judgment appears in the Libera me, which, like Verdi, he added to the normal liturgical text.Rosen, pp. 60‚Äì74 Faur√© revised the Requiem over the years, and a number of different performing versions are now in use, from the earliest, for small forces, to the final revision with full orchestra.Orledge, Robert \\"Faur√© Revised\\", The Musical Times, May 1980, p. 327 Faur√©'s operas have not found a place in the regular repertoire. Prom√©th√©e is the more neglected of the two, with only a handful of performances in more than a century.Duchen, p. 197 Copland considered P√©n√©lope (1913) a fascinating work, and one of the best operas written since Wagner; he noted, however, that the music is, as a whole, \\"distinctly non-theatrical.\\" The work uses leitmotifs, and the two main roles call for voices of heroic quality, but these are the only ways in which the work is Wagnerian. In Faur√©'s late style, \\"tonality is stretched hard, without breaking.\\"Murray, p. 120 On the rare occasions when the piece has been staged, critical opinion has generally praised the musical quality of the score, but has varied as to the dramatic effectiveness of the work. When the opera was first presented in London in 1970, in a student production by the Royal Academy of Music, Peter Heyworth wrote, \\"A score that offers rich rewards to an attentive ear can none the less fail to cut much ice in the theatre. ... Most of the music is too recessive to be theatrically effective.\\"Heyworth, Peter. \\"Neglected Penelope\\", The Observer, 29 November 1970, p. 78 However, after a 2006 production at the Wexford Festival, Ian Fox wrote, \\"Faur√©'s P√©n√©lope is a true rarity, and, although some lovely music was anticipated, it was a surprise how sure the composer's theatrical touch was.\\"Fox, Ian. \\"Opera in Review\\", Opera Canada, January 2006, pp. 45‚Äì47 =Piano works= Faur√©'s major sets of piano works are thirteen nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses- caprices. These sets were composed across the decades of his career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B major, Th√®me et variations in C major, and Huit pi√®ces br√®ves. For piano duet, Faur√© composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil Andr√© Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth.Duchen, pp. 222‚Äì224 The piano works often use arpeggiated figures, with the melody interspersed between the two hands, and include finger substitutions natural for organists. These aspects make them daunting for some pianists. Even a virtuoso like Liszt said that he found Faur√©'s music hard to play. The early piano works are clearly influenced by Chopin.Nectoux (1991), p. 49 An even greater influence was Schumann, whose piano music Faur√© loved more than any other.Nectoux (1991), p. 43 In Copland's view, it was with the sixth Nocturne that Faur√© fully emerged from any predecessor's shadow. The pianist Alfred Cortot said, \\"There are few pages in all music comparable to these.\\" The critic Bryce Morrison has noted that pianists frequently prefer to play the charming earlier piano works, such as the Impromptu No. 2, rather than the later piano works, which express \\"such private passion and isolation, such alternating anger and resignation\\" that listeners are left uneasy.Morrison, p. 7 In his piano music, as in most of his works, Faur√© shunned virtuosity in favour of the classical lucidity often associated with the French. He was unimpressed by purely virtuoso pianists, saying, \\"the greater they are, the worse they play me.\\"Nectoux (1991), p. 379 =Orchestral and chamber works= Faur√© was not greatly interested in orchestration, and on occasion asked his former students such as Jean Roger- Ducasse and Charles Koechlin to orchestrate his concert and theatre works. In Nectoux's words, Faur√©'s generally sober orchestral style reflects \\"a definite aesthetic attitude ... The idea of timbre was not a determining one in Faur√©'s musical thinking\\".Nectoux (1991), p. 259 He was not attracted by flamboyant combinations of tone-colours, which he thought either self-indulgent or a disguise for lack of real musical invention. He told his students that it should be possible to produce an orchestration without resorting to glockenspiels, celestas, xylophones, bells or electrical instruments.Duchen, p. 132 Debussy admired the spareness of Faur√©'s orchestration, finding in it the transparency he strove for in his own 1913 ballet Jeux; Poulenc, by contrast, described Faur√©'s orchestration as \\"a leaden overcoat ... instrumental mud\\".Nectoux (1991), p. 258 Faur√©'s best-known orchestral works are the suites Masques et bergamasques (based on music for a dramatic entertainment, or divertissement comique), which he orchestrated himself,Duchen, p. 196 Dolly, orchestrated by Henri Rabaud,Duchen, p. 226 and Pell√©as et M√©lisande which draws on incidental music for Maeterlinck's play; the stage version was orchestrated by Koechlin, but Faur√© himself reworked the orchestration for the published suite. In the chamber repertoire, his two piano quartets, in C minor and G minor, particularly the former, are among Faur√©'s better-known works.Sackville-West, p. 265 His other chamber music includes two piano quintets, two cello sonatas, two violin sonatas, a piano trio and a string quartet. Copland (writing in 1924 before the string quartet was finished) held the second quintet to be Faur√©'s masterpiece: \\"... a pure well of spirituality ... extremely classic, as far removed as possible from the romantic temperament.\\" Other critics have taken a less favourable view: The Record Guide commented, \\"The ceaseless flow and restricted colour scheme of Faur√©'s last manner, as exemplified in this Quintet, need very careful management, if they are not to become tedious.\\" Faur√©'s last work, the String Quartet, has been described by critics in Gramophone magazine as an intimate meditation on the last things,Nichols, Roger. \\"Faur√© and Ravel\\", Gramophone, August 2000, p. 69 and \\"an extraordinary work by any standards, ethereal and other-worldly with themes that seem constantly to be drawn skywards.\\"Cowan, Rob. \\"Debussy, Faur√©, Ravel\\", Gramophone, December 2008, p. 97 =Recordings= Faur√© made piano rolls of his music for several companies between 1905 and 1913. Well over a hundred recordings of Faur√©'s music were made between 1898 and 1905, mostly of songs, with a few short chamber works, by performers including the singers Jean Not√© and Pol Plan√ßon and players such as Jacques Thibaud and Alfred Cortot.Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music, accessed 3 May 2012 By the 1920s a range of Faur√©'s more popular songs were on record, including \\"Apr√®s un r√™ve\\" sung by Olga Haley,\\"Vocalion\\", The Gramophone, April 1925, p. 63 and \\"Automne\\" and \\"Clair de lune\\" sung by Ninon Vallin.\\"Ninon Vallin\\", The Gramophone, November 1929, p. 19 In the 1930s better-known performers recorded Faur√© pieces, including Georges Thill (\\"En pri√®re\\"),\\"Georges Thill\\", The Gramophone, December 1937, p. 18 and Jacques Thibaud and Alfred Cortot (Violin Sonata No. 1 and Berceuse).\\"Review\\", The Gramophone, July 1932, p. 11; and \\"Chamber Music\\", The Gramophone, December 1932, p. 19 The Sicilienne from Pell√©as et M√©lisande was recorded in 1938.Anderson, W R. \\"Second Reviews\\", The Gramophone, July 1938, p. 24 By the 1940s there were a few more Faur√© works in the catalogues. A survey by John Culshaw in December 1945 singled out recordings of piano works played by Kathleen Long (including the Nocturne No. 6, Barcarolle No. 2, the Th√®me et Variations, Op. 73, and the Ballade Op. 19 in its orchestral version conducted by Boyd Neel), the Requiem conducted by Ernest Bourmauck, and seven songs sung by Maggie Teyte.Culshaw, John. \\"The Return of Faur√©\\", The Gramophone, December 1945, p. 15 Faur√©'s music began to appear more frequently in the record companies' releases in the 1950s.

The critic Robert Orledge writes, \\"His genius was one of synthesis: he reconciled such opposing elements as modality and tonality, anguish and serenity, seduction and force within a single non- eclectic style, as in the Pell√©as et M√©lisande suite, his symphonic masterpiece. The quality of constant renewal within an apparently limited range ... is a remarkable facet of his genius, and the spare, elliptical style of his single String Quartet suggests that his intensely self-disciplined style was still developing at the time of his death\\".Orledge, Robert. \\"Faur√©, Gabriel (Urbain)\\", The Oxford Companion to Music, Oxford Music Online, accessed 26 September 2010 Notes and references = Notes = = References = Sources          * External links * Gabriel Faur√© MIDI files ‚Äì Kunst der Fuge site  * Free scores at the Mutopia Project * Oeuvres compl√®tes pour orgue / J.S.

He is considered to be the father of modern Dispensationalism and Futurism. Pre-tribulation rapture theology was popularized extensively in the 1830s by John Nelson Darby and the Plymouth Brethren, and further popularized in the United States in the early 20th century by the wide circulation of the Scofield Reference Bible.The Scofield Bible: Its History and Impact on the Evangelical Church, Magnum & Sweetnam. Pages 188-195, 218. He produced translations of the Bible in German \\"Elberfelder Bibel\\", French \\"Pau\\" Bible, Dutch New Testament, and English (finished posthumously) based on the Hebrew and Greek texts called The Holy Scriptures: A New Translation from the Original Languages by J. N. Darby. It has furthermore been translated into other languages in whole or part. Biography =Early years= John Nelson Darby was born in Westminster, London, and christened at St. Margaret's on 3 March 1801. He was the youngest of the six sons of John Darby and Anne Vaughan. The Darbys were an Anglo-Irish landowning family seated at Leap Castle, King's County, Ireland, (present-day County Offaly). He was the nephew of Admiral Henry D'Esterre Darby and his middle name was given in recognition of his godfather and family friend, Lord Nelson. Darby was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Dublin where he graduated Classical Gold Medallist in 1819. Darby embraced Christianity during his studies, although there is no evidence that he formally studied theology. He joined an inn of court, but felt that being a lawyer was inconsistent with his religious belief. The future Bishop of Meath and evangelical Joseph Singer tutored him at Trinity. He, therefore, chose ordination as an Anglican clergyman in Ireland, \\"lest he should sell his talents to defeat justice.\\" In 1825, Darby was ordained deacon of the established Church of Ireland and the following year as priest. =Middle years= Gravestone of John Nelson Darby in Wimborne Road Cemetery, in Bournemouth, England. Darby became a curate in the Church of Ireland parish of Delgany, County Wicklow, and distinguished himself by persuading Roman Catholic peasants in the Calary district within this parish to abandon the Catholic Church. The well-known gospel tract \\"How the Lost Sheep was Saved\\" gives his personal account of a visit he paid to a dying shepherd boy in this area, painting a vivid picture of what his work among the poor people involved. He later claimed to have won hundreds of converts to the Church of Ireland. However, the conversions ended when William Magee, the Anglican Archbishop of Dublin, ruled that converts were obliged to swear allegiance to George IV as rightful king of Ireland. Darby resigned his curacy in protest. Soon afterwards, in October 1827, he fell from a horse and was seriously injured. He later stated that it was during this time that he began to believe that the \\"kingdom\\" described in the Book of Isaiah and elsewhere in the Old Testament was entirely different from the Christian church. Over the next five years, he developed the principles of his mature theology ‚Äî most notably his conviction that the very notion of a clergyman was a sin against the Holy Spirit, because it limited the recognition that the Holy Spirit could speak through any member of the Church. During this time (1827-28) he joined an interdenominational meeting of believers (including Anthony Norris Groves, Edward Cronin, J. G. Bellett, and Francis Hutchinson) who met to \\"break bread\\" together in Dublin as a symbol of their unity in Christ. By 1832, this group had grown and began to identify themselves as a distinct Christian assembly. As they traveled and began new assemblies in Ireland and England, they formed the movement now known as the Plymouth Brethren. It is believed that John Nelson Darby left the Church of Ireland around 1831.The year in which Darby left the Church of Ireland, a branch of the Anglican Church, is not certain but a consensus of opinion is that it was possibly around 1831. Searches for formal documentation of his resignation have been made in the Church of Ireland archives, but nothing has been found. He participated in the 1831‚Äì33 Powerscourt Conference, an annual meeting of Bible students organized by his friend,It is widely believed that Darby and Lady Powerscourt were romantically attached but friends persuaded him that any marriage may prove a distraction. the wealthy widow Lady Powerscourt. At the conference Darby publicly described his ecclesiological and eschatological views, including the pre-tribulation rapture. p. 82 For about 40 years William Kelly (1821‚Äì1906) was his chief interpreter and continued to be a staunch supporter until his own death. Kelly in his work John Nelson Darby as I knew him stated that \\"a saint more true to Christ's name and word I never knew or heard of\\". Darby defended Calvinist p. 46 doctrines when they came under attack from within the Church in which he once served. His biographer Goddard Goddard, \\"The Contribution of Darby,\\" p. 86 states, \\"Darby indicates his approval of the doctrine of the Anglican Church as expressed in Article XVII of the Thirty-Nine Articles\\" on the subject of election and predestination. Darby said: =Later years= Darby traveled widely in Europe and Britain in the 1830s and 1840s, and established many Brethren assemblies. He gave 11 significant lectures in Geneva in 1840 on the hope of the church (L'attente actuelle de l'√©glise). These established his reputation as a leading interpreter of biblical prophecy. America did not embrace Darby's ecclesiology like it did his eschatology which is still being propagated (in various forms) at such places as Dallas Theological Seminary and by authors and preachers such as Hal Lindsey and Tim LaHaye. In 1848, Darby became involved in a complex dispute over the proper method for maintaining shared standards of discipline in different assemblies that resulted in a split between Open Brethren, which maintained a congregational form of government and Exclusive Brethren. After that time, he was recognized as the dominant figure among the Exclusives, who also came to be known as \\"Darbyite\\" Brethren. He made at least 5 missionary journeys to North America between 1862 and 1877. He worked mostly in New England, Ontario, and the Great Lakes region, but took one extended journey from Toronto to Sydney by way of San Francisco, Hawaii, and New Zealand. A Geographical Index of his letters is currently available and lists where he traveled. He used his classical skills to translate the Bible from Hebrew and Greek texts into several languages. In English he wrote a Synopsis of the Bible and many other scholarly religious articles. He wrote hymns and poems, the most famous being, \\"The Man of Sorrows\\", (not to be confused with \\"Man of Sorrows, What a name\\" by Philip Bliss (1838-1876)). The Man of Sorrows He was also a Bible commentator. His writings were collected in his lifetime and published from January 1866 as \\"The Collected Writings of J. N. Darby\\"; there were 32 volumes published ‚Äì two per year 1866‚Äì81 and two more soon after.{Dates of J.N.Darby's Collected Writings, Published by Bible and Gospel Trust 2013} He translated the Bible with the help of various brethren in different countries into German, French and English.{Dates of J. N. Darby's Collected Writings, page 4 & 5, Published by Bible and Gospel Trust 2013} He declined, however, to contribute to the compilation of the Revised Version of the King James Bible even though the revisers consulted Darby's work.John Nelson Darby Biography He died 1882 in Sundridge House, Bournemouth and is buried in Bournemouth, Dorset, England. Darby is noted in the theological world as the father of \\"dispensationalism\\", whose eschatology was adopted and later made popular in the United States by Cyrus Scofield's Scofield Reference Bible. Charles Henry Mackintosh, 1820‚Äì1896, with his popular style spread Darby's teachings to humbler elements in society and may be regarded as the journalist of the Brethren Movement. Mackintosh popularised Darby more than any other Brethren author. In the early twentieth century, the Brethren's teachings, through Margaret E. Barber, greatly influenced the Little Flock or Church Assembly Hall of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee. Darby has been credited with originating the pre- tribulational rapture theory wherein Christ will suddenly remove His bride, the Church, from this world to its heavenly destiny before the judgments of the tribulation. Thus the prophetic program resumes with Israel's earthly destiny. Dispensationalist beliefs about the fate of the Jews and the re- establishment of the Kingdom of Israel put dispensationalists at the forefront of Christian Zionism, because \\"God is able to graft them in again,\\"Romans 11:23 and they believe that in His grace he will do so according to their understanding of Old Testament prophecy. They believe that, while the ways of God may change, His purposes to bless Israel will never be forgotten, just as He has shown unmerited favour to the Church, He will do so to a remnant of Israel to fulfill all the promises made to the genetic seed of Abraham. In 1829 he predicted the rebirth of a nation Israel over 100 years before it happened, just by reading the Bible (pgs. 141-160. Prophetic No. 1 Vol. 2. J. N. Darby. Stow Hill Bible & Tract Depot. Kingston-On-Thames 1829) Criticism Charles Haddon Spurgeon, Pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle and contemporary of Darby, published criticism of Darby and Brethrenism. His main criticism was that Darby and the Plymouth Brethren rejected the vicarious purpose of Christ's obedience as well as imputed righteousness. He viewed these of such importance and so central to the Gospel that it led him to publish this statement about the rest of their belief in the Sword and Trowel. James Grant wrote: \\"With the deadly heresies entertained and taught by the Plymouth Brethren, in relation to some of the most momentous of all the doctrines of the Gospel, and to which I have adverted at some length, I feel assured that my readers will not be surprised at any other views, however unscriptural and pernicious they may be, which the Darbyites have embraced and zealously seek to propagate\\"  Works  * The Holy Bible a new translation by J.N.

His most significant work was for the Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, where he was crucial in the creation and evolution of famous animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Droopy, Screwy Squirrel, George and Junior, and Chilly Willy. Gary Morris described Avery's innovative approach: > Above all, [Avery] steered the Warner Bros. house style away from Disney- > esque sentimentality and made cartoons that appealed equally to adults, who > appreciated Avery's speed, sarcasm, and irony, and to kids, who liked the > nonstop action. Disney's \\"cute and cuddly\\" creatures, under Avery's > guidance, were transformed into unflappable wits like Bugs Bunny, endearing > buffoons like Porky Pig, or dazzling crazies like Daffy Duck. Even the > classic fairy tale, a market that Disney had cornered, was appropriated by > Avery, who made innocent heroines like Red Riding Hood into sexy jazz babes, > more than a match for any Wolf. Avery also endeared himself to intellectuals > by constantly breaking through the artifice of the cartoon, having > characters leap out of the end credits, loudly object to the plot of the > cartoon they were starring in, or speak directly to the audience. Avery's style of directing encouraged animators to stretch the boundaries of the medium to do things in a cartoon that could not be done in the world of a live-action film. An often-quoted line about Avery's cartoons was, \\"In a cartoon, you can do anything.\\"Adamson, Joe, Tex Avery: King of Cartoons, New York: Da Capo Press, 1975. He also performed a great deal of voice work in his cartoons, usually throwaway bits. He also occasionally filled in for Bill Thompson as Droopy. Early years Avery was born to George Walton Avery (1867‚Äì1935) and Mary Augusta \\"Jessie\\" (n√©e Bean; 1886‚Äì1931) in Taylor, Texas. His father was born in Alabama and his mother was born in Chickasaw County, Mississippi. Avery, nicknamed \\"Tex\\", \\"Fred\\", and \\"Texas\\", was born and raised in Taylor, Texas, a small town in the vicinity of Austin. Avery graduated in 1926 from North Dallas High School.Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages A popular catchphrase at his school was \\"What's up, doc?\\", which he would later utilize for Bugs Bunny in the 1940s. Interested in becoming a newspaper cartoonist, he took a three-month summer course at the Chicago Art Institute but left after a month. Animation career On January 1, 1928, Avery arrived in Los Angeles. He spent the following months working in menial jobs. According to animation historian Michael Barrier, these jobs included working in a warehouse, working on the docks at night, loading fruits and vegetables, and painting cars. He began his animation career when hired by the short-lived Winkler studio (named after producer Margaret J. Winkler). He was only an inker, inking cels for animated short films in the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit series. Avery then moved to a new studio, Universal Studio Cartoons (later known as Walter Lantz Productions). He was again employed as an inker but moved rapidly up the studio's hierarchy. By 1930, Avery had been promoted to the position of animator. Avery continued working at the Walter Lantz Studio into the early 1930s. He worked on most of the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons from 1931 to 1935. He is shown as 'animator' on the original title card credits on the Oswald cartoons. He later claimed to have directed two cartoons during this time. =Accident to eye= During some office horseplay at the Lantz studio, a thumbtack or paper clip flew into Avery's left eye and caused him to lose his sight in that eye. Some speculate it was his lack of depth perception that gave him his unique look at animation and bizarre directorial style, but it did not stop his creative career. The incident is described in some detail by Barrier, based in part on old interviews with Avery. Part of the typical crude horseplay at the Universal studio was using a rubber band or a paper spitball to target the back of a colleague's head. They would shout \\"Bull's eye\\" after every successful shot. An animator called Charles Hastings decided to take the game one step further, by using a wire paper clip instead. Avery heard one of his colleagues telling him to look out. He reacted by turning around. Instead of the back of his head, the paper clip hit Avery in his left eye. He instantly lost the use of his eye. =From inker to storyboards= As an animator, Avery worked under director Bill Nolan. Nolan reportedly delegated work to Avery, whenever Avery had to animate a sequence. Nolan's instructions for a scene involving Oswald being chased by bees were reportedly simple. He would describe in which direction Oswald was running (\\"right to left\\") and for how many feet. The rest of the details were left up to Avery. Avery started handing out work to other animators working under Nolan. Avery wanted still greater control over the creative process and served as a de facto director for a couple of films. Based on Avery's recollections, there is a description of how this happened. He was submitting sight gags for use in the short films. Some of them were used in the actual films, and some funny ones were left out. He wanted to somehow get all his gags in the finished film. So he asked Nolan to let him create the entire storyboard for a film. Nolan instructed Avery to not only draw the storyboard but to work on the timing and the layout on his own. Avery completed two films using this process. An older Avery recalled that both films \\"were terrible\\", though they got accepted for release. Avery was reportedly displeased with his salary and had started giving up on his work. After about six weeks of substandard work, his superiors let him go. In April 1935, Avery lost his job at the Universal studio. = \\"Termite Terrace\\" = Later in 1935, Avery applied for a job at Leon Schlesinger Productions (the company later known as Warner Bros. Cartoons). Avery reportedly managed to convince producer Leon Schlesinger that he was an experienced director, a false claim. In Avery's own words: By 1935, when Avery was hired, the Schlesinger studio had only two full-time, regular film directors: Friz Freleng and Jack King. Avery became the third regular director. The staff of the Schlesinger studio had become too large to be housed in a single building, at the Warner Bros. backlot in Sunset Boulevard. The new Avery unit of the studio was granted their own building, a five-room bungalow. The unit staff dubbed their quarters \\"Termite Terrace\\", due to its significant termite population.International Aminated Film Society \\"Termite Terrace\\" later became the nickname for the entire Schlesinger/Warners studio, primarily because Avery and his unit were the ones who defined what became known as \\"the Warner Bros. cartoon.\\" Avery was granted exclusive use of four animators: Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, Sid Sutherland and Virgil Ross. The first animated short film produced by this unit was Gold Diggers of '49 (1935), the third Looney Tunes film starring Beans. Beans was also featured in the film's title card, signifying that he was the intended protagonist. The film had a Western setting and cast Beans as a gold miner. Also featured in the film was a redesigned Porky Pig, making his second appearance. The Avery unit was assigned to work primarily on the black-and-white Looney Tunes instead of the Technicolor Merrie Melodies. Avery stopped using Beans following Gold Diggers of '49, but continued using Porky as a star character. According to Michael Barrier, Beans was more of a straight man. However, Porky had to be redesigned again. The early Porky was decidedly \\"piglike\\" in appearance. In Michael Barrier's description: Porky was very fat, had small eyes, a large snout, and pronounced jowls. He was like a porcine version of Roscoe Arbuckle. Starting with Porky the Rainmaker (1936), his fourth animated short starring Porky, Avery introduced a cuter version of Porky. The new design gave Porky more prominent eyes and a smaller snout. The jowls were replaced by chubby cheeks. Porky's body now had a rounder shape; its defining trait was not fatness but softness. Barrier notes that the new design by Avery departed from the \\"Disneyish\\" realism in the previous drawing style. Porky became a less- realistic pig and looked more like a cartoon character. According to Martha Sigall, Avery was one of the few directors to visit the ink and paint department - she avers that he liked to see how his cartoons were turning out. He would answer questions and be always in good humor. When some of the artists humorously criticized the wild action in his animated shorts, Avery would take time to explain his rationale.Sigall (2005), p. 48-49 He recalled that while working at Warner Bros., the animators had a great deal of liberty, and were subject to very little censorship of their work.Cohen (2004), p. 37 =Creation of Looney Tunes stars= Avery, with the assistance of Clampett, Jones, and the new associate director Frank Tashlin, laid the foundation for a style of animation that dethroned The Walt Disney Studio as the leader in animated short films, and created a legion of cartoon characters still known today. Avery, in particular, was deeply involved. He crafted gags for the shorts, periodically provided voices for them (including his trademark belly laugh), and held such control over the timing of the shorts that he would add or cut frames out of the final negative if he felt a gag's timing was not quite right. Porky's Duck Hunt introduced the character of Daffy Duck, who possessed a new form of \\"lunacy\\" and zaniness that had not been seen before in animated cartoons. Daffy was an almost completely out-of-control \\"darn fool duck\\" who frequently bounced around the film frame in double-speed, screaming \\"Hoo-hoo! hoo-hoo\\" in a high-pitched, sped-up voice provided by the voice artist Mel Blanc, who, with this cartoon, also took over providing the voice of Porky Pig. Avery directed two more Daffy Duck cartoons: Daffy Duck & Egghead and Daffy Duck in Hollywood. Egghead was a character inspired by comedian Joe Penner which would evolve into Elmer Fudd and first appeared in Avery's Egghead Rides Again. Ben Hardaway, Cal Dalton and Chuck Jones directed a series of shorts which featured a Daffy Duck-like rabbit, created by Ben \\"Bugs\\" Hardaway. As is the case with most directors, each puts his own personal stamp on the characters, stories and overall feel of a short. So each of these cartoons treated the rabbit differently. The next to try out the rabbit, known around Termite Terrace as \\"Bugs's bunny\\" (named after Hardaway), was Avery. Since the recycling of storylines among the directors was commonplace, \\"A Wild Hare\\" was a double throwback. Avery had directed the '37 short, \\"Porky's Duck Hunt\\" featuring Porky Pig which introduced \\"Daffy Duck.\\" Hardaway remade this as \\"Porky's Hare Hunt\\" introducing the rabbit. So Avery went back to the \\"hunter and prey\\" framework, and incorporating Jones' \\"Elmer's Candid Camera\\", gag for gag, and altering the design of Elmer Fudd. Polishing the timing, and expanding the Groucho Marx smart-aleck attitude already present in \\"Porky's Hare Hunt\\", making Bugs a kind of Brooklyn-esque super-cool rabbit who was always in control of the situation and who ran rings around his opponents. Avery has stated that it was very common to refer to folks in Texas as \\"doc\\", much like \\"pal\\", \\"dude\\" or \\"bud\\". In A Wild Hare, Bugs adopts this colloquialism when he casually walks up to Elmer, who is \\"hunting wabbits\\" and while carefully inspecting a rabbit hole, shotgun in hand, the first words out of Bugs's mouth is a coolly calm, \\"What's up, doc?\\" Audiences reacted riotously to the juxtaposition of Bugs's nonchalance and the potentially dangerous situation, and \\"What's up, doc?\\" instantly became the rabbit's catchphrase. Avery ended up directing only four Bugs Bunny cartoons: A Wild Hare, Tortoise Beats Hare, All This and Rabbit Stew, and The Heckling Hare. During this period, he also directed a number of one-shot shorts, including travelogue parodies (The Isle of Pingo Pongo), fractured fairy-tales (The Bear's Tale), Hollywood caricature films (Hollywood Steps Out), and cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny clones (The Crack-Pot Quail). Avery's tenure at the Schlesinger studio ended in late 1941 when he and the producer quarreled over the ending to The Heckling Hare. In Avery's original version, Bugs and the hunting dog were to fall off a cliff three times, milking the gag to its comic extreme. According to a DVD commentary for the cartoon, the historian and animator Greg Ford explained that the problem Schlesinger had with the ending was that, just before falling off the third time, Bugs and the dog were to turn to the screen, with Bugs saying \\"Hold on to your hats, folks, here we go again!\\", a punchline to a potentially risqu√© joke of the day. The Hollywood Reporter reported on the quarrel on April 2, 1941. Avery was slapped with a four-week, unpaid suspension.Cohen (2004), p. 39 =Speaking of Animals= While at Schlesinger, Avery created a concept of animating lip movement to live-action footage of animals. Schlesinger was not interested in Avery's idea, so Avery approached Jerry Fairbanks, a friend of his who produced the Unusual Occupations series of short subjects for Paramount Pictures. Fairbanks liked the idea and the Speaking of Animals series of shorts was launched. When Avery left the Schlesinger studio in mid-1941, he went straight to Paramount to work on the first three shorts in the series before joining Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. The series continued without him, lasting seven years.Sigall (2005), p. 48-49 = Avery at MGM = Jerky Turkey (1945) On September 2, 1941, the Reporter announced that Avery had signed a five-year contract with Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, where he was to form his own animation unit and direct shorts in Technicolor.Cohen (2004), p. 39 By 1942, Avery was in the employ of MGM, working in their cartoon division under the supervision of Fred Quimby. Avery felt that Schlesinger had stifled him. When asked if he missed the Looney Tunes characters, he responded: \\"Sometimes, but I don't miss anything else. MGM is a heck of a better place to work, in every way, and the people here are just as great.\\"Sigall (2005), p. 48-49 At MGM, Avery's creativity reached its peak. His cartoons became known for their sheer lunacy, breakneck pace, and a penchant for playing with the medium of animation and film in general that few other directors dared to approach. MGM also offered him larger budgets and a higher quality production level than the Warners studio; plus, his unit was filled with talented ex-Disney artists such as Preston Blair and Ed Love. These changes were evident in Avery's first short released by MGM, The Blitz Wolf, an Adolf Hitler parody of the \\"Three Little Pigs\\" story which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) in 1942. Avery's cartoons at MGM somewhat felt like Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons done during that same period at Warner Bros., two cartoon series that Avery himself had worked on back then, albeit the Warners' series gained more popularity than Avery's MGM cartoons. Avery's best known MGM character debuted in Dumb-Hounded (1943). Droopy (originally \\"Happy Hound\\") was a small, calm, slow-moving and slow-talking dog who always won out in the end, whatever difficulties he was presented with. He also created a series of risqu√© cartoons, beginning with Red Hot Riding Hood (also 1943), featuring a sexy female star who never had a set name but has been unofficially referred to as \\"Red\\" by fans. Her visual design and voice varied somewhat between shorts. Other Avery characters at MGM included Screwy Squirrel and the Of Mice and Men-inspired duo of George and Junior. Other MGM cartoons directed by Avery include Bad Luck Blackie, Cellbound, Magical Maestro, Lucky Ducky, Ventriloquist Cat and King-Size Canary. Avery began his stint at MGM working with lush colors and realistic backgrounds, but he slowly abandoned this style for a more frenetic, less realistic approach. The newer, more stylized look reflected the influence of the up-and-coming UPA studio, the need to cut costs as budgets grew higher, and Avery's own desire to leave reality behind and make cartoons that were not tied to the real world of live-action. During this period, he made a series of films which explored the technology of the future: The House of Tomorrow, The Car of Tomorrow, The Farm of Tomorrow and TV of Tomorrow (spoofing common live-action promotional shorts of the time). He also introduced a slow-talking wolf character, who was the prototype for MGM associates Hanna-Barbera's Huckleberry Hound character, right down to the voice by Daws Butler. Avery took a year's sabbatical from MGM beginning in 1950 (to recover from overwork), during which time Dick Lundy, recently arrived from the Walter Lantz studio, took over his unit and made one Droopy cartoon, as well as a string of shorts featuring Barney Bear. Avery returned to MGM in October 1951 and began working again. Avery's last two original cartoons for MGM were Deputy Droopy and Cellbound, completed in 1953 and released in 1955. They were co-directed by the Avery unit animator Michael Lah. Lah began directing a handful of CinemaScope Droopy shorts on his own. A burnt-out Avery left MGM in 1953 to return to the Walter Lantz studio. =Post-MGM work= Avery's return to the Lantz studio did not last long. He directed four cartoons in 1954‚Äì1955: the shorts Crazy Mixed Up Pup, Sh-h-h-h- h-h, I'm Cold and The Legend of Rockabye Point, in which he defined the character of Chilly Willy the penguin. Although The Legend of Rockabye Point and Crazy Mixed Up Pup were nominated for Academy Awards, Avery left Lantz over a salary dispute, effectively ending his career in theatrical animation. Avery left three new Chilly Willy storyboards which would later be made into cartoons by Alex Lovy. He turned to animated television commercials, including the Raid ones of the 1960s and 1970s, in which cartoon insects, confronted by the bug killer, screamed \\"RAID!\\" and died flamboyantly, and Frito-Lay's controversial mascot, the Frito Bandito. Avery also produced ads for Kool-Aid fruit drinks starring the Looney Tunes characters he had once helped create during his Termite Terrace days. During the 1960s and 1970s, Avery became increasingly reserved and depressed due to the suicide of his son and the break-up of his marriage, although he continued to draw respect from his peers. His final employer was Hanna-Barbera Productions, where he wrote gags for Saturday morning cartoons such as the Droopy-esque Kwicky Koala. Personal life Two days after being fired from Universal in Spring 1935, Avery married his girlfriend, Patricia. She was also employed at Universal Studios, as an inker. The newlyweds spent a long honeymoon in Oregon, but had to return to Los Angeles when they ran out of money. Death On Tuesday, August 26, 1980, Avery died of lung cancer at St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank, California at age 72. He is buried in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery. Legacy Avery's influence can be seen in modern cartoons such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Ren & Stimpy Show, Animaniacs, and SpongeBob SquarePants. An Avery-esque cowboy character bore his name in the otherwise unrelated series The Wacky World of Tex Avery. Avery's work has been featured on shows such as The Tex Avery Show and Cartoon Alley. Many references related to Tex Avery have appeared in various animated television series or animated films. One reference appeared in the basketball-themed film Space Jam. In this film, Lola Bunny demonstrates her basketball skills and then the film makes use of the \\"Tex Avery-style\\" gag concerning the libido of males: Bugs Bunny, who was smitten by her, floats up into the air and then crashes back down onto the floor. The scene is reminiscent of \\"Wolfie\\" from Red Hot Riding Hood (1943), a character defined by his lust for females. This effect serves to reduce Bugs and his fellow characters to stereotypical \\"guys\\". In the mid-1990s, Dark Horse Comics released a trio of three-issue miniseries that were openly labeled tributes to Avery's MGM cartoons, Wolf & Red, Droopy and Screwy Squirrel, which other characters make appearances in the comics such as George and Junior, Spike, and the one-shot characters. Tex Avery, unlike most Warner Bros. directors, kept many original title frames of his cartoons, several otherwise lost due to Blue Ribbon Reissues. Rare prints and art containing original titles and unedited animation from Avery's MGM and Warner Bros. cartoons are now usually sold on eBay or in the collections of animators and cartoon enthusiasts. In 2008, France issued three postage stamps honoring Tex Avery for his 100th birthday, depicting Droopy, the redheaded showgirl, and the wolf.Stamps issued by France on March 3, 2008, memorializing Tex Avery's creative work, series FRO20-08, Universal Postal Union data base. All of his MGM shorts were released in a North American MGM/UA laserdisc set called The Compleat Tex Avery. While two cartoons on the set were edited versions, these being the blackface gags in Droopy's Good Deed and Garden Gopher, others, including the controversial Uncle Tom's Caba√±a and Half-Pint Pygmy were included intact (although these were removed from the Region 2 DVD release, now out of print). Several of his cartoons were released on VHS, in four volumes of Tex Avery's Screwball Classics, two VHS Droopy collections, and various inclusions on MGM animation collection releases, with many gags edited out for television showings left in. Avery's Droopy cartoons are available on the DVD set Tex Avery's Droopy: The Complete Theatrical Collection. The seven Droopy cartoons produced in CinemaScope were included here in their original widescreen versions (albeit letter-boxed), instead of the pan and scan versions regularly broadcast on television. Also, some of his works could be found on home video releases (from VHS to Blu-ray) of Warner Bros.' Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes shorts, and the same is true of his few Lantz Studio cartoons included in the DVD set The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection. In February 2020, Warner Archive released Tex Avery Screwball Classics Volume 1 on Blu-ray containing 19 of his MGM cartoons. The shorts are not presented in chronological order, because according to Jerry Beck, most of MGM's pre-1951 cartoons had their original negatives destroyed in a 1965 vault fire- causing massive difficulties in terms of restoration. However, using the best surviving archival elements, all 19 shorts on the set have been digitally restored in HD and are presented completely uncut.https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tex-avery-talk-with- jerry-beck/id310063354?i=1000465417564 In March 2020 Warner Archive announced they were working on Tex Avery Screwball Classics Volume 2 and will be released on a yet to be determined date.https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/happy-11th-birthday-to- us/id310063354?i=1000469759300 Anime director Masaaki Yuasa has mentioned Tex Avery's work as one of his main influences.

(More generally, residues can be calculated for any function f\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{a_k\\\\\\\\}_k \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} that is holomorphic except at the discrete points {ak}k, even if some of them are essential singularities.) Residues can be computed quite easily and, once known, allow the determination of general contour integrals via the residue theorem.  Definition  The residue of a meromorphic function f at an isolated singularity a, often denoted \\\\operatorname{Res}(f,a) or \\\\operatorname{Res}_a(f), is the unique value R such that f(z)- R/(z-a) has an analytic antiderivative in a punctured disk 0<\\\\vert z-a\\\\vert<\\\\delta. Alternatively, residues can be calculated by finding Laurent series expansions, and one can define the residue as the coefficient a‚àí1 of a Laurent series. The definition of a residue can be generalized to arbitrary Riemann surfaces. Suppose \\\\omega is a 1-form on a Riemann surface. Let \\\\omega be meromorphic at some point x, so that we may write \\\\omega in local coordinates as f(z) \\\\; dz. Then the residue of \\\\omega at x is defined to be the residue of f(z) at the point corresponding to x.  Examples  = Residue of a monomial = Computing the residue of a monomial :\\\\oint_C z^k \\\\, dz makes most residue computations easy to do. Since path integral computations are homotopy invariant, we will let C be the circle with radius 1. Then, using the change of coordinates z \\\\to e^{i\\\\theta} we find that : dz \\\\to d(e^{i\\\\theta}) = ie^{i\\\\theta} \\\\, d\\\\theta hence our integral now reads as : \\\\oint_C z^k dz = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} i e^{i(k+1)\\\\theta} \\\\, d\\\\theta = \\\\begin{cases} 2\\\\pi i & \\\\text{if } k = -1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise}. \\\\end{cases} = Application of monomial residue = As an example, consider the contour integral :\\\\oint_C {e^z \\\\over z^5}\\\\,dz where C is some simple closed curve about 0. Let us evaluate this integral using a standard convergence result about integration by series. We can substitute the Taylor series for e^z into the integrand. The integral then becomes :\\\\oint_C {1 \\\\over z^5}\\\\left(1+z+{z^2 \\\\over 2!} + {z^3\\\\over 3!} + {z^4 \\\\over 4!} + {z^5 \\\\over 5!} + {z^6 \\\\over 6!} + \\\\cdots\\\\right)\\\\,dz. Let us bring the 1/z5 factor into the series. The contour integral of the series then writes : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\oint_C \\\\left({1 \\\\over z^5}+{z \\\\over z^5}+{z^2 \\\\over 2!\\\\;z^5} + {z^3\\\\over 3!\\\\;z^5} + {z^4 \\\\over 4!\\\\;z^5} + {z^5 \\\\over 5!\\\\;z^5} + {z^6 \\\\over 6!\\\\;z^5} + \\\\cdots\\\\right)\\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] = {} & \\\\oint_C \\\\left({1 \\\\over\\\\;z^5}+{1 \\\\over\\\\;z^4}+{1 \\\\over 2!\\\\;z^3} + {1\\\\over 3!\\\\;z^2} + {1 \\\\over 4!\\\\;z} + {1\\\\over\\\\;5!} + {z \\\\over 6!} + \\\\cdots\\\\right)\\\\,dz. \\\\end{align} Since the series converges uniformly on the support of the integration path, we are allowed to exchange integration and summation. The series of the path integrals then collapses to a much simpler form because of the previous computation. So now the integral around C of every other term not in the form cz‚àí1 is zero, and the integral is reduced to : \\\\oint_C {1 \\\\over 4!\\\\;z} \\\\,dz= {1 \\\\over 4!} \\\\oint_C{1 \\\\over z}\\\\,dz={1 \\\\over 4!}(2\\\\pi i) = {\\\\pi i \\\\over 12}. The value 1/4! is the residue of ez/z5 at z = 0, and is denoted : \\\\operatorname{Res}_0 {e^z \\\\over z^5}, \\\\text{ or } \\\\operatorname{Res}_{z=0} {e^z \\\\over z^5}, \\\\text{ or } \\\\operatorname{Res}(f,0) \\\\text{ for } f={e^z \\\\over z^5}.  Calculating residues  Suppose a punctured disk D = {z : 0 < z ‚àí c < R} in the complex plane is given and f is a holomorphic function defined (at least) on D. The residue Res(f, c) of f at c is the coefficient a‚àí1 of in the Laurent series expansion of f around c. Various methods exist for calculating this value, and the choice of which method to use depends on the function in question, and on the nature of the singularity. According to the residue theorem, we have: : \\\\operatorname{Res}(f,c) = {1 \\\\over 2\\\\pi i} \\\\oint_\\\\gamma f(z)\\\\,dz where Œ≥ traces out a circle around c in a counterclockwise manner. We may choose the path Œ≥ to be a circle of radius Œµ around c, where Œµ is as small as we desire. This may be used for calculation in cases where the integral can be calculated directly, but it is usually the case that residues are used to simplify calculation of integrals, and not the other way around. =Removable singularities= If the function f can be continued to a holomorphic function on the whole disk y-c, then Res(f, c) = 0\\\\. The converse is not generally true. =Simple poles= At a simple pole c, the residue of f is given by: :\\\\operatorname{Res}(f,c)=\\\\lim_{z\\\\to c}(z-c)f(z). It may be that the function f can be expressed as a quotient of two functions, f(z)=\\\\frac{g(z)}{h(z)}, where g and h are holomorphic functions in a neighbourhood of c, with h(c) = 0 and h'(c) ‚â† 0\\\\. In such a case, L'H√¥pital's rule can be used to simplify the above formula to: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Res}(f,c) & =\\\\lim_{z\\\\to c}(z-c)f(z) = \\\\lim_{z\\\\to c}\\\\frac{z g(z) - cg(z)}{h(z)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] & = \\\\lim_{z\\\\to c}\\\\frac{g(z) + z g'(z) - cg'(z)}{h'(z)} = \\\\frac{g(c)}{h'(c)}. \\\\end{align} =Limit formula for higher-order poles= More generally, if c is a pole of order n, then the residue of f around z = c can be found by the formula: : \\\\operatorname{Res}(f,c) = \\\\frac{1}{(n-1)!} \\\\lim_{z \\\\to c} \\\\frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}} \\\\left( (z-c)^n f(z) \\\\right). This formula can be very useful in determining the residues for low-order poles. For higher-order poles, the calculations can become unmanageable, and series expansion is usually easier. For essential singularities, no such simple formula exists, and residues must usually be taken directly from series expansions. =Residue at infinity= In general, the residue at infinity is given by: : \\\\operatorname{Res}(f(z), \\\\infty) = -\\\\operatorname{Res}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{z^2} f\\\\left(\\\\frac 1 z \\\\right), 0\\\\right). If the following condition is met: : \\\\lim_{z \\\\to \\\\infty} f(z) = 0, then the residue at infinity can be computed using the following formula: : \\\\operatorname{Res}(f, \\\\infty) = -\\\\lim_{z \\\\to \\\\infty} z \\\\cdot f(z). If instead : \\\\lim_{z \\\\to \\\\infty} f(z) = c eq 0, then the residue at infinity is : \\\\operatorname{Res}(f, \\\\infty) = \\\\lim_{z \\\\to \\\\infty} z^2 \\\\cdot f'(z). = Series methods = If parts or all of a function can be expanded into a Taylor series or Laurent series, which may be possible if the parts or the whole of the function has a standard series expansion, then calculating the residue is significantly simpler than by other methods. and : u(1/V(z)) = \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sqrt{1 + 4z}}{2z} + \\\\frac{1 + 2z + \\\\sqrt{1 + 4z}}{2z^2}. The first term contributes 1 to the residue, and the second term contributes 2 since it is asymptotic to 1/z^2 + 2/z. Note that, with the corresponding stronger symmetric assumptions on \\\\textstyle u(z) and \\\\textstyle v(z), it also follows : \\\\operatorname{Res}_0 \\\\left(u(1/V)\\\\right) = \\\\operatorname{Res}_0\\\\left(v(1/U)\\\\right), where \\\\textstyle U(z) is a local inverse of \\\\textstyle u(z) at 0\\\\. }} See also * The residue theorem relates a contour integral around some of a function's poles to the sum of their residuals * Cauchy's integral formula * Cauchy's integral theorem * Mittag-Leffler's theorem * Methods of contour integration * Morera's theorem * Partial fractions in complex analysis References   External links   Category:Meromorphic functions ","title":"Residue (complex analysis)"},{"id":"73105","text":"Irish Lissarulla hurling sliotar A club hurling match in play, after the helmet regulation Hurling (, ') is an outdoor team game of ancient Gaelic Irish origin. One of Ireland's native Gaelic games, it shares a number of features with Gaelic football, such as the field and goals, the number of players, and much terminology. There is a similar game for women called camogie ('). It shares a common Gaelic root with the sport of shinty ('), which is played predominantly in Scotland. The objective of the game is for players to use a wooden (ash) stick called a hurl (in Irish a ', pronounced or ) to hit a small ball called a ' between the opponents' goalposts either over the crossbar for one point, or under the crossbar into a net guarded by a goalkeeper for one goal, which is equivalent to three points. The ' can be caught in the hand and carried for not more than four steps, struck in the air, or struck on the ground with the hurl. It can be kicked, or slapped with an open hand (the hand pass) for short-range passing. A player who wants to carry the ball for more than four steps has to bounce or balance the ' on the end of the stick, and the ball can only be handled twice while in his possession. Provided that a player has at least one foot on the ground, a player may make a shoulder to shoulder charge on an opponent who is in possession of the ball or is playing the ball or when both players are moving in the direction of the ball to play it. No protective padding is worn by players. A plastic protective helmet with a faceguard is mandatory for all age groups, including senior level, as of 2010. The game has been described as \\"a bastion of humility\\", with player names absent from jerseys and a player's number decided by his position on the field. Hurling is administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). It is played throughout the world, and is popular among members of the Irish diaspora in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and South Korea. In many parts of Ireland, however, hurling is a fixture of life. It has featured regularly in art forms such as film, music and literature. The final of the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship was listed in second place by CNN in its \\"10 sporting events you have to see live\\", after the Olympic Games and ahead of both the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship. After covering the 1959 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final between Kilkenny and Waterford for BBC Television, English commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme was moved to describe hurling as his second favourite sport in the world after his first love, football. Alex Ferguson used footage of an All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final in an attempt to motivate his players during his time as manager of Premier League football club Manchester United; the players winced at the standard of physicality and intensity in which the hurlers were engaged. In 2007, Forbes magazine described the media attention and population multiplication of Thurles town ahead of one of the game's annual provincial hurling finals as being \\"the rough equivalent of 30 million Americans watching a regional lacrosse game\\". UNESCO lists hurling as an element of Intangible cultural heritage. Statistics * A team comprises 15 players, or \\"hurlers\\" * The hurl is generally in length * The ball, known as a sliotar, has a cork centre and a leather cover; it is between in diameter, and weighs between * The goalkeeper's hurl usually has a bas (the flattened, curved end) twice the size of other players' hurleys to provide some advantage against the fast moving sliotar * A good strike with a hurl can propel the ball over in speed and in distance. * A ball hit over the bar is worth one point. A ball that is hit under the bar is called a goal and is worth three points. * As of 2010, all players must wear helmets. Rules =Playing field= A standard hurling pitch A hurling pitch is similar in some respects to a rugby pitch but larger. The grass pitch is rectangular, stretching long and wide. There are H-shaped goalposts at each end, formed by two posts, which are usually high, set apart, and connected above the ground by a crossbar. A net extending behind the goal is attached to the crossbar and lower goal posts. The same pitch is used for Gaelic football; the GAA, which organises both sports, decided this to facilitate dual usage. Lines are marked at distances of 14 yards, 21 yards and 65 yards (45 yards for Gaelic football) from each end-line. Shorter pitches and smaller goals are used by youth teams. =Teams= Standard hurling positions Teams consist of fifteen players: a goalkeeper, three full backs, three half backs, two midfielders, three half forwards and three full forwards (see diagram). The panel is made up of 24‚Äì30 players and five substitutions are allowed per game. An exception can now be made in the case of a blood substitute being necessary. =Helmets= 165x165px From 1 January 2010, the wearing of helmets with faceguards became compulsory for hurlers at all levels. This saw senior players follow the regulations already introduced in 2009 at minor and under 21 grades. The GAA hopes to significantly reduce the number of injuries by introducing the compulsory wearing of helmets with full faceguards, both in training and matches. Hurlers of all ages, including those at nursery clubs when holding a hurley in their hand, must wear a helmet and faceguard at all times. Match officials will be obliged to stop play if any player at any level appears on the field of play without the necessary standard of equipment. =Duration, extra time, replays= Senior inter-county matches last 70 minutes (35 minutes per half). All other matches last 60 minutes (30 minutes per half). For teams under-13 and lower, games may be shortened to 50 minutes. Timekeeping is at the discretion of the referee who adds on stoppage time at the end of each half. There are various solutions for knockout games that end in a draw, such as a replay, or what the rules refer to as \\"Winner on the Day\\" measures such as extra time (20 minutes), further extra time (10 more minutes), or a shoot- out. The application and details of these measures vary according to the importance of the match and the difficulty of scheduling possible replays, and can change from year to year. The general trend is that the GAA have been trying to reduce the need for replays, to ease scheduling. =Technical fouls= The following are considered technical fouls (\\"fouling the ball\\"): * Picking the ball directly off the ground (instead it must be flicked up with the hurley) * Throwing the ball (instead it must be \\"hand-passed\\": slapped with the open hand) * Going more than four steps with the ball in the hand (it may be carried indefinitely on the hurley) * Catching the ball three times in a row without it touching the ground (touching the hurley does not count) * Putting the ball from one hand to the other * Hand-passing a goal * \\"Chopping\\" slashing downwards on another player's hurl. =Scoring= Goalposts and scoring system used in hurling Scoring is achieved by sending the sliotar between the opposition's goal posts. The posts, which are at each end of the field, are H posts as in rugby football but with a net under the crossbar as in football. The posts are 6.4 m apart and the crossbar is 2.44 m above the ground. If the ball goes over the crossbar, a point is scored and a white flag is raised by an umpire. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a goal, worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised by an umpire. A goal must be scored by either a striking motion or by directly soloing the ball into the net. The goal is guarded by a goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format {goal total} ‚Äì {point total}. For example, the 1997 All-Ireland final finished: Clare 0‚Äì20 Tipperary 2‚Äì13. Thus Clare won by \\"twenty points to nineteen\\" (20 to 19). 2‚Äì0 would be referred to as \\"two goals\\", never \\"two zero\\". Likewise, 0‚Äì10 would be referred to as \\"ten points\\", never \\"zero ten\\". 0‚Äì0 is said \\"no score\\". An example of a typical GAA scoreboard =Tackling= Players may be tackled but not struck by a one handed slash of the stick; exceptions are two-handed jabs and strikes. Jersey-pulling, wrestling, pushing and tripping are all forbidden. There are several forms of acceptable tackling, the most popular being: * the \\"block\\", where one player attempts to smother an opposing player's strike by trapping the ball between his hurley and the opponent's swinging hurl * the \\"hook\\", where a player approaches another player from a rear angle and attempts to catch the opponent's hurley with his own at the top of the swing * the \\"side pull\\", where two players running together for the sliotar will collide at the shoulders and swing together to win the tackle and \\"pull\\" (name given to swing the hurley) with extreme force =Restarting play= Player taking a penalty puck from the 20-metre line. * The match begins with the referee throwing the sliotar in between the four midfielders on the halfway line * After an attacker has scored or put the ball wide of the goals, the goalkeeper may take a \\"puckout\\" from the hand at the edge of the small square. All players must be beyond the 20 m line. * After a defender has put the ball wide of the goals, an attacker may take a \\"65\\" from the 65 m line level with where the ball went wide. It must be taken by lifting and striking. However, the ball must not be taken into the hand but struck whilst the ball is lifted. * After a player has put the ball over the sideline, the other team may take a 'sideline cut' at the point where the ball left the pitch. It must be taken from the ground. * After a player has committed a foul, the other team may take a 'free' at the point where the foul was committed. It must be taken by lifting and striking in the same style as the \\"65\\". * After a defender has committed a foul inside the square (large rectangle), the other team may take a \\"penalty\\" from the ground from behind the 20 m line. Only the goalkeeper may guard the goals. It must be taken by lifting and striking and the sliotar must be struck on or behind the 20m line (The penalty rule was amended in 2015 due to safety concerns. Before this the ball merely had to start at the 20m line but could be struck beyond it. To balance this advantage the two additional defenders previously allowed on the line have been removed). * If many players are struggling for the ball and no side is able to capitalize or gain control of it the referee may choose to throw the ball in between two opposing players. This is also known as a \\"throw in\\". =Officials= A hurling match is watched over by eight officials: * The referee (on field) * Two linesmen (sideline) * Sideline official/standby linesman (inter-county games only) * Four umpires (two at each end) *Hawkeye Video technology for some scoring situations in Croke Park and Semple Stadium (inter-county games only) The referee is responsible for starting and stopping play, recording the score, awarding frees, noting infractions, and issuing yellow (caution) and red (order off) penalty cards to players after offences. A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a dismissal. Linesmen are responsible for indicating the direction of line balls to the referee and also for conferring with the referee. The fourth official is responsible for overseeing substitutions, and also indicating the amount of stoppage time (signalled to him by the referee) and the players substituted using an electronic board. The umpires are responsible for judging the scoring. They indicate to the referee whether a shot was: wide (spread both arms), a 65 m puck (raise one arm), a point (wave white flag), or a goal (wave green flag). Contrary to popular belief within the association, all officials are not obliged to indicate \\"any misdemeanours\\" to the referee, but are in fact permitted to inform the referee only of violent conduct they have witnessed which has occurred without the referee's knowledge. A linesman or umpire is not permitted to inform the referee of technical fouls such as a \\"third time in the hand\\", where a player catches the ball for a third time in succession after soloing or an illegal pick up of the ball. Such decisions can only be made at the discretion of the referee. Risks Blunt injury to the larynx is an infrequent consequence of contact sports despite protective equipment and stringent rules. Hurling, one of the two national sporting games of Ireland, is seen as one of the fastest field sports on earth and only played with a facemask and helmet as protection, making injury an unavoidable feature of the game. History A hurling stick and ball feature on this gallowglasses gravestone, circa 15-16th century. A graph demonstrating hurling scoring since 1910 Graph of hurling and Gaelic football ratio of points to goals from 1910 to 2015 Hurling is older than the recorded history of Ireland. It is thought to predate Christianity, having come to Ireland with the Celts. The earliest written references to the sport in Brehon law date from the fifth century. Seamus King's book A History of Hurling references oral history going back as far as 1200 BCE of the game being played in Tara, County Meath. Hurling is related to the games of shinty that is played primarily in Scotland, cammag on the Isle of Man and bando which was played formerly in England and Wales. The tale of the T√°in B√≥ Cuailgne (drawing on earlier legends) describes the hero C√∫chulainn playing hurling at Emain Macha. Similar tales are told about Fionn Mac Cumhail and the Fianna, his legendary warrior band. Recorded references to hurling appear in many places such as the fourteenth century Statutes of Kilkenny and a fifteenth- century grave slab survives in Inishowen, County Donegal. Hurling was said to be played in ancient times by teams representing neighbouring villages. Villages would play games involving hundreds of players, which would last several hours or even days. The eighteenth century is frequently referred to as \\"The Golden Age of Hurling\\". This was when members of the Anglo-Irish landed gentry kept teams of players on their estates and challenged each other's teams to matches for the amusement of their tenants. One of the first modern attempts to standardise the game with a formal, written set of rules came with the foundation of the Irish Hurling Union at Trinity College Dublin in 1879. It aimed \\"to draw up a code of rules for all clubs in the union and to foster that manly and noble game of hurling in this, its native country\\". The founding of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884 in Hayes Hotel, Thurles, Co Tipperary, ended decline by organising the game around a common set of written rules. In 1891 the first All-Ireland hurling final was played with Kerry winning the championship. However, the twentieth century saw Cork, Kilkenny and Tipperary dominate hurling with each of these counties winning more than 20 All-Ireland titles each. Wexford, Waterford, Clare, Limerick, Offaly, Antrim, Dublin, and Galway were also strong hurling counties during the twentieth century. As hurling entered the new millennium, it has remained Ireland's second most popular sport. An extended qualifier system resulted in a longer All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. Pay-for-play remains controversial and the Gaelic Players Association continues to grow in strength. The inauguration of the Christy Ring Cup and Nicky Rackard Cup gave new championships and an opportunity to play in Croke Park to the weaker county teams. Further dissemination of the championship structure was completed in 2009 with the addition of the Lory Meagher Cup to make it a four tier championship. =Hurling at the Olympic Games= Hurling was an unofficial sport at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States. In the final, Fenian F.C. (Chicago) USA beat Innisfails (St. Louis). This was the only time hurling was in the Olympics. International Although many hurling clubs exist worldwide, only Ireland has a national team (although it includes only players from weaker counties in order to ensure matches are competitive). It and the Scotland shinty team have played for many years with modified match rules (as with International Rules Football). The match is the only such international competition. However, competition at club level has been going on around the world since the late nineteenth century thanks to emigration from Ireland, and the strength of the game has ebbed and flowed along with emigration trends. Nowadays, growth in hurling is noted in Continental Europe, Australia, and North America. =Argentina= Irish immigrants began arriving in Argentina in the nineteenth century. The earliest reference to hurling in Argentina dates from the late 1880s in Mercedes, Buenos Aires. However, the game was not actively promoted until 1900, when it came to the attention of author and newspaperman William Bulfin. Under Bulfin's patronage, the Argentine Hurling Club was formed on 15 July 1900, leading to teams being established in different neighborhoods of Buenos Aires and the surrounding farming communities. Games of hurling were played every weekend until 1914 and received frequent coverage from Argentina's Spanish language newspapers, such as La Naci√≥n. After the outbreak of World War I, it became almost impossible to obtain hurleys from Ireland. An attempt was made to use native Argentine mountain ash, but it proved too heavy and lacking in pliability. Although the game was revived after the end of the war, the golden age of Argentine hurling had passed. World War II finally brought the era to its close. In the aftermath of the Second World War, immigration from Ireland slowed to a trickle. In addition, native born Irish-Argentines assimilated into the local community. The last time that hurling was played in Argentina was in 1980, when the Aer Lingus Hurling Club conducted a three-week tour of the country and played matches at several locations. Since 2009, with the realization of several Summers Camps and the visit of the All Stars in December, hurling returned to be a frequent activity at the Hurling Club, where many boys and young men have since been trained and taught to play. Even the Hurling Club are invited to participate Hurling Festival is organized within The Gathering events organized by Aer Lingus. This team will be present in September 2013 in the city of Galway. The team consists of 21 players from Hockey and Rugby teams. Many have contributed to the return of hurling as an activity in the club. As an example we can name Alejandro Yoyo Wade, Johnny Wade, Barbie, Cecilia and Irene Scally, David Ganly, Dickie Mac Allister, Eduardo Cabrera Punter, Hernan Magrini Scally. Several Irish have participated in many opportunities to work with the skills and education: Jonathan Lynch, Kevin O'Connors and Michael Connery, who currently works with the team's training to participate in the Aer Lingus International Hurling Festival. =Australia= The earliest reference to hurling in Australia is related in the book \\"Sketches of Garryowen.\\" On 12 July 1844, a match took place at Batman's Hill in Melbourne as a counterpoint to a march by the Orange Order. Reportedly, the hurling match attracted a crowd of five hundred Irish immigrants, while the Orange march shivered out of existence. Several hurling clubs existed in Victoria in the 1870s including Melbourne, Collingwood, Upper Yarra, Richmond and Geelong. In 1885, a game between two Sydney based teams took place before a crowd of over ten thousand spectators. Reportedly, the contest was greatly enjoyed despite the fact that one newspaper dubbed the game \\"Two Degrees Safer Than War.\\" Arden Street Oval in North Melbourne was used by Irish immigrants during the 1920s. The game in Australasia is administered by Australasia GAA. =Great Britain= Hurling was brought to Great Britain in the 19th century. The game is administered by British GAA. Warwickshire and Lancashire compete at inter-county level in the Lory Meagher Cup, competing against other counties in Ireland. London is the only non-Irish team to have won the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (having captured the title in 1901), and after winning the 2012 Christy Ring Cup gained the right to contest the Liam MacCarthy Cup in 2013. The first ever hurling game played in the Scottish Highlands was played at Easter 2012 between CLG Micheal Breathnach and Fir Uladh, an Ulster select of Gaeiligoiri, as part of the Iomain Cholmcille festival, na Breathnaich coming out victorious. Wales has its own club, St. Colmilles in Cardiff.https://web.archive.org/web/20110813041427/http://cardiffgaa.org.uk/ =South Africa= Soldiers who served in the Irish Brigade during the Anglo- Boer War are believed to have played the game on the veldt. Immigrants from County Wicklow who had arrived to work in the explosives factory in Umbogintwini, KwaZulu-Natal formed a team c. 1915‚Äì16. A major burst of immigration in the 1920s led to the foundation of the Transvaal Hurling Association in Johannesburg in 1928. Games were traditionally played in a pitch on the site of the modern day Johannesburg Central Railway Station every Easter Sunday after Mass. In 1932, a South African hurling team sailed to Ireland to compete in the Tailteann Games, where they carried a banner donated by a convent of Irish nuns in Cape Town. On their arrival, they were personally received by the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) at the time, √âamon de Valera. South African hurling continued to prosper until the outbreak of the Second World War, which caused immigration from Ireland to cease and made it impossible to import equipment. Games of hurling and Gaelic football were occasionally sponsored by the Christian Brothers schools in Boksburg and Pretoria well into the 1950s. Both games have all but ceased to be played. =North America= U.S. president Barack Obama accepting a hurley from Taoiseach Enda Kenny Litherman's collaboration beer label References to hurling on the North American continent date from the 1780s in modern-day Canada concerning immigrants from County Waterford and County Kilkenny, and also, in New York City. After the end of the American Revolution, references to hurling cease in American newspapers until the aftermath of the Great Famine when Irish people moved to America in huge numbers, bringing the game with them. Newspaper reports from the 1850s refer to occasional matches played in San Francisco, Hoboken and New York City. The first game of hurling played under GAA rules outside Ireland was played on Boston Common in June 1886. In 1888, there was an American tour by fifty Gaelic athletes from Ireland, known as the 'American Invasion'. This created enough interest among Irish Americans to lay the groundwork for the North American GAA. By the end of 1889, almost a dozen GAA clubs existed in America, many of them in and around New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Later, clubs were formed in Boston, Cleveland, and many other centers of Irish America. Concord, New Hampshire has its state's only hurling team, New Hampshire Wolves, sponsored by Litherman's Limited Craft Brewery. In 1910, twenty-two hurlers, composed of an equal number from Chicago and New York, conducted a tour of Ireland, where they played against the County teams from Kilkenny, Tipperary, Limerick, Dublin and Wexford.Traditionally, hurling was a game played by Irish immigrants and discarded by their children. Many American hurling teams took to raising money to import players directly from Ireland. In recent years, this has changed considerably with the advent of the Internet and increased travel. The Barley House Wolves hurling team from New Hampshire was formed when U.S. soldiers returning from Iraq saw a hurling game on the television in Shannon Airport as their plane refuelled. Outside of the traditional North American GAA cities of New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, clubs are springing up in other places where they consist of predominantly American-born players who bring a new dimension to the game and actively seek to promote it as a mainstream sport, especially Joe Maher, a leading expert at the sport in Boston. Currently, the Milwaukee Hurling Club, with 300 members, is the largest Hurling club in the world outside Ireland, which is made of all Americans and very few Irish immigrants. The St. Louis Gaelic Athletic Club was established in 2002 and has expanded its organization to an eight team hurling league in the spring and six team Gaelic football league in the fall. They also have a 30-member camogie league. Saint Louis has won two National Championships in Jr C Hurling (2004 and 2011), as well as two National Championships in Jr D Gaelic Football (2005, and 2013). The Indianapolis Hurling Club began in 2002, then reformed in 2005. In 2008, the Indy Hurling Club won the Junior C National Championship. In 2011, Indy had 7 club teams and sent a Junior B, Junior C and Camogie team to nationals. Hurling continues to grow in popularity with teams now in Charleston, SC, Orlando, FL, Tampa, FL, Augusta, GA, Greenville, SC, Indianapolis, IN, Worcester, MA, Corvallis, OR, Akron, OH, Akron, OH,https://www.facebook.com/Hurling/ Raleigh, NC, Concord, NH, Portland, Maine, Providence, RI, Twin Cities, MN, Madison, WI, Milwaukee, WI,https://hurling.net/ Washington, DC, Hampton Roads, VA, Rochester NY, Nashville, TN, Richmond, VA, and Hartford, Connecticut. The GAA have also begun to invest in American college students with university teams springing up at University of Connecticut, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Purdue University, Indiana University, University of Montana and other schools. On 31 January 2009, the first ever US collegiate hurling match was held between UC Berkeley and Stanford University, organized by the newly formed California Collegiate Gaelic Athletic Association. UC Berkeley won the challenge match by one point, while Stanford won the next two CCGAA matches to win the first collegiate cup competition in the U.S. On Memorial Day Weekend of 2011, the first ever National Collegiate GAA championship was played. The Indiana University Hurling Club won all matches of the tournament, and won by four points in the championship final to be crowned the first ever U.S. National Collegiate Champions.

The cemetery was opened in November 1876, and is located north of Moore Park, a neighbourhood of Toronto. The cemetery has kilometres of drives and walking paths, interspersed with fountains, statues, botanical gardens, and rare and distinct trees, originally laid out by German-born landscape architect Henry Adolph Engelhardt, inspired by the European and American garden cemeteries of the 19th century, and with influences from Mount Auburn Cemetery in Boston.https://www.mountpleasantgroup.com/General- Information/Our%20Monthly%20Story/story-archives/mount-pleasant- cemetery/Mount%20Pleasant%20Cemetery.aspx As the final resting place of more than 168,000 persons, Mount Pleasant Cemetery contains remarkable architecture amongst its many monuments. The cemetery was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2000. History In the early 19th century, the only authorized cemeteries within the town of York (predecessor to present-day Toronto) were limited to the members of either the Roman Catholic Church or the Church of England. Deceased citizens who did not belong to either of these Christian denominations had no choice but to find burial arrangements outside of the city. Notably, those of Jewish faith who wanted a Jewish burial had to resort to cemeteries beyond Ontario (Montreal and Buffalo) until Pape Avenue Cemetery was opened outside of Toronto in 1849. A photograph of the cemetery's public vault, 1891. In response to a petition to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada, which included ‚Äú...it has become desirable that a Plot be obtained for the purpose of a General Burying Ground, as well for Strangers as for the Inhabitants of the Town, of whatever sect or denomination they may be‚Äù, a statute named An act to authorize certain persons therein named, and their successors, to hold certain lands for the purpose therein mentioned was passed and received Royal Assent in 1826: Acts of U.C. 7 Geo. IV, c. 21.Early Canadiana Online The land that came to be known as the ‚ÄúPotters Field‚ÄùFind A Grave was acquired and started operation as a cemetery soon afterwards. Over time additional cemetery lands were added to what became the Toronto General Burying Ground. In 1873, a new cemetery available to all citizens was established. The new cemetery was situated on an farm on Lot 19 Concession 3 (also referred to as Yonge Street Farm) once owned by the Cawthra family and likely by William Cawthra, on the far outskirts of the city. Mount Pleasant Cemetery formally opened on 4 November 1876 with more than of carriage drives along rolling hills and ponds. Mount Pleasant Road was later constructed to pass through the centre of the cemetery and is named after this cemetery. The cemetery also has remains and a number of stone markers that were moved from the Potter's Field. The urban expansion of Toronto eventually led to Mount Pleasant being situated in the centre of the city. A number of Canadian servicemen who died during the World Wars were interred at the cemetery. The cemetery contains 231 Commonwealth War Graves, comprising 126 burials in World War I and 105 in World War II. 188 are of the Canadian, and 43 the British, armed forces. CWGC Cemetery Report. The Visitation Centre was completed in 2009. In the autumn of 2009, the cemetery opened Mount Pleasant Visitation Centre. The new building is approximately and is built on the property grounds. It was built with the intention to provide visitation space and chapel services.http://www.visitationcentre.ca/MP_new-visit.html Accessed October 2nd, 2009 The cemetery began planning the building as early as 2004, but disputeshttp://canlii.ca/t/1qss1 Humphrey Funeral Home v. Toronto (City), 2007 with the City of Toronto government, local ratepayer associations, and the Ontario Municipal Board all delayed the project. Changes were made as a result of this process, most notably vehicle access is now through the cemetery grounds only (near the cemetery offices), not directly from Moore Avenue. http://www.visitationcentre.ca/MP_design.html Accessed October 2nd, 2009 http://www.moorepark.org/ Accessed October 2nd, 2009  Press  Despite the cemetery having been created as a public trust by Special Act of the Ontario legislature in 1826, Mount Pleasant Group began to assert publicly that it had been converted in 1871 into a corporation subject to the Corporations Act. Community activist Margot Boyd and others argued that its status as a public trust remained unchanged. With donations from the community, Boyd engaged the McCarthy Tetrault law firm in 2009 to review the statutes pertaining to Mount Pleasant Group. An 18-page letter sent to Premier Dalton McGuinty stated: ‚ÄúLegally, this trust might be characterized in several ways, but an accurate description of the trust in question is a ‚Äòpublic trust.‚Äô ‚Äù Local politicians MPP Glenn Murray and Toronto Councillor Josh Matlow both agreed at the time.https://streeter.ca/toronto/news/some-fights- never-die/ As early as 2006, Mount Pleasant Group began describing itself as a commercial privately owned entity, and refused to disclose its financial records, giving rise to allegations that it was engaged in the stealth privatization of a public asset. In 2012 Mount Pleasant Group commenced a public relations campaign against Boyd and others in an attempt to deflect criticism, and to discredit its detractors by labelling them NIMBYs.https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/grave-concerns-is-mount-pleasant- cemetery-group-ontarios-lost-crown-corporation https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/books-staying-closed-on-mount-pleasant- cemeteries In December 2012, Boyd and lawyer and community activist Pamela Taylor organized a public trustee election in accordance with the requirements of the 1849 Special Act.https://www.toronto.com/news-story/1487568-neighbours- fuel-controversy-at-mount-pleasant-cemetery-by-electing-their-own-trustee/ In 2013, over the objections of local residents, Mount Pleasant Group installed a new crematorium.

Camogie is played by 100,000 women in Ireland and worldwide, largely among Irish communities. A variant of the game of hurling (which is played by men only) adapted to suit women, it is organised by the Dublin-based Camogie Association or An Cumann Cam√≥ga√≠ochta. The annual All Ireland Camogie Championship has a record attendance of 33,154,2007 All Ireland final reports in Irish Examiner, Irish Independent, Irish Times and Gorey Guardian while average attendances in recent years are in the region of 15,000 to 18,000. The final is broadcast live, with a TV audience of as many as over 300,000 being claimed. UNESCO lists Camogie as an element of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The game is referenced in Waiting for Godot by Irish playwright Samuel Beckett. Game & rules Goalposts and scoring system used in camogie The game consists of two thirty-minute halves. There is a half-time interval of 10 minutes. In event of extra time, halves must consist of 10 minutes each. Each team has 15 players on the field. Within the 15 players the team must consist of one goalkeeper, three full back players, three half back players, two centre-field players, three half forward players and three full forward players. There is a minimum requirement of 12 players on the pitch at all times. The rules are almost identical to hurling, with a few exceptions. *Goalkeepers wear the same colours as outfield players. This is because no special rules apply to the goalkeeper and so there is no need for officials to differentiate between goalkeeper and outfielders. *A camogie player can handpass any score from play (handpassing a goal is forbidden in hurling since 1980). *Camogie games last 60 minutes, two 30-minute halves (senior inter-county hurling games last 70, which is two 35-minute halves). Ties are resolved by multiple 2√ó10-minute sudden death extra time periods; in these, the first team to score wins. *Dropping the camogie stick to handpass the ball is permitted. *A smaller sliotar (ball) is used in camogie ‚Äì commonly known as a size 4 sliotar ‚Äì whereas hurlers play with a size 5 sliotar. *If a defending player hits the sliotar wide, a 45-metre puck is awarded to the opposition (in hurling, it is a 65-metre puck). *After a score, the goalkeeper pucks out from the 13-metre line (in hurling, he must puck from the end line). *The metal band on the camogie stick must be covered with tape (not necessary in hurling). *Side-to- side charges are forbidden (permitted in hurling). *Two points are awarded for a score direct from a sideline cut (since March 2012). Camogie players must wear skirts or skorts rather than shorts. Partly due to these differences, some argue that Camogie lacks the physical drama found in hurling. Under the original 1903 rules both the match and the field were shorter than their hurling equivalents. Matches were 40 minutes, increased to 50 minutes in 1934, and playing fields 125‚Äì130 yards (114-119m) long and 65‚Äì70 yards (59-64m) wide. From 1929 until 1979 a second crossbar, a \\"points bar\\" was also used, meaning that a point would not be allowed if it travelled over this bar, a somewhat contentious rule through the 75 years it was in use. Teams were regulated at 12 a side, using an elliptical formation, although it was more a \\"squeezed lemon\\" formation with the three midfield players grouped more closely together than their counterpart on the half back and half-forward lines. In 1999 camogie moved to the GAA field-size and 15-a-side, adopting the standard GAA butterfly formation. =Field and equipment= The field is not of a fixed size, but must be between 130m long by 80m wide, and 145m long by 90m wide. =Goals and scoring= H-shaped goals are used. A team achieves a score by making the ball go between the posts. If the ball goes over the bar for a \\"point\\", the team earns one point. If the ball goes under the bar for a \\"goal\\", the team earns three points. History =Foundation= The name was invented by Tadhg Ua Donnchadha (T√≥rna) at meetings in 1903 in advance of the first matches in 1904. It is derived from stick used in the game. Men play hurling using a curved stick called a cam√°n in Irish. Women in the early camogie games used a shorter stick described by the diminutive form cam√≥g. The suffix -a√≠ocht (originally \\"uidheacht\\") was added to both words to give names for the sports: cam√°na√≠ocht (which became iom√°na√≠ocht) and cam√≥ga√≠ocht. When the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded in 1884 the English-origin name \\"hurling\\" was given to the men's game. When an organisation for women was set up in 1904, it was decided to anglicise the Irish name cam√≥ga√≠ocht to camogie. The experimental rules were drawn up for the female game by M√°ire N√≠ Chinn√©ide, Se√°n (Sceilg) √ì Ceallaigh, Tadhg √ì Donnchadha and S√©amus √ì Braon√°in. The Official Launch of Camogie took place with the first public match between Craobh an Ch√©itinnigh (Keatings branch of the Gaelic League) and C√∫chulainns on 17 July at a Feis in Navan. The sport's governing body, the Camogie Association or An Cumann Cam√≥ga√≠ochta was founded in 1905 and re- constituted in 1911, 1923 and 1939. Until June 2010 it was known as Cumann Cam√≥ga√≠ochta na nGael. M√°ire N√≠ Chinn√©ide and C√°it N√≠ Dhonnchadha, two prominent Irish-language enthusiasts and cultural nationalists, were credited with having created the sport, with the assistance of N√≠ Dhonnchadha's scholarly brother Tadhg √ì Donnchadha, who drew up its rules. Thus, although camogie was founded by women, and independently run (although closely linked to the GAA), there was, from the outset, a small yet powerful male presence within its administrative ranks. It was no surprise that camogie emanated from the Gaelic League, nor that it would be dependent upon the structures and networks provided by that organisation during the initial expansion of the sport. Of all the cultural nationalist organisations for adults that emerged during the fin de si√®cle, the Gaelic League was the only one to accept female and male members on an equal footing.R√≠ona Nic Cong√°il ‚Äú'Looking on for centuries from the side-line': Gaelic Feminism and the rise of Camogie\\", √âire- Ireland (Spring / Summer 2013): 168‚Äì192.Gaelic Feminism and the rise of Camogie A camogie team pictured in Waterford in October 1915 =Leagues= An Cumann Cam√≥ga√≠ochta has a similar structure to the Gaelic Athletic Association, with an Annual Congress every spring which decides on policy and major issues such as rule changes, and an executive council, the √Ård Ch√≥mhairle which deals with short-term issues and governance. The game is administered from a headquarters in Croke Park in Dublin. Each of 28 county boards takes control of its own affairs (all of the Irish counties except Fermanagh, Leitrim and Sligo), with the number of clubs ranging from 58 in Cork to one in Leitrim. There are four provincial councils and affiliates in Asia, Australia, Britain, Europe, New York, New Zealand and North America. =Clubs= There are 537 camogie clubs, of which 513 (95.5%) are based on the island of Ireland, 47 in Connacht (8.8%), 195 in Leinster (36.4%), 160 in Munster (29.8%), and 110 in Ulster (20.5%). * Antrim 22 * Armagh 18 * Carlow 6 * Cavan 9 * Clare 26 * Cork 58 * Derry 23 * Donegal 3 * Down 21 * Dublin 39 * Europe 4 * Fermanagh 0 * Galway 34 * Kerry 3 * Kildare 19 * Kilkenny 33 * Laois 7 * Leitrim 1 * Limerick 25 * London 7 * Longford 1 * Louth 6 * Mayo 3 * Meath 14 * Monaghan 4 * New South Wales 5 * United States 7 * Offaly 12 * Roscommon 7 * Sligo 2 * Tipperary 32 * Tyrone 10 * Waterford 16 * W.

The All-Ireland Final is held every year in Croke Park during September, usually on the week between the hurling final and Gaelic football final, and attracts attendances of up to 33,000. The senior camogie championship finals tends to be less eventful than their counterparts in the men's sport of hurling. There are lower score tallies and seldom is there a goal. Only fourteen points were scored by the winning team in the 2018 senior final, and most points in the game followed the awarding of frees. Ten points was sufficient to determine the winner of the 2017 senior final. * The All Ireland Club Championship is staged at Senior, Intermediate and Junior level, usually reaching the final stages in November‚ÄìDecember or the following March. * Eleven teams will contest the second-tier Jack McGrath Cup in 2018 (All Ireland intermediate championship): Antrim, Carlow, Derry, Down, Kildare, Laois, and Westmeath, and the second teams of Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, and Tipperary. * Seven teams contested the third-tier Kay Mills Cup (All Ireland junior or 'Premier Junior\\" championship) in 2018: Armagh, Kerry, Roscommon, and the second teams of Clare, Dublin, Limerick, and Offaly. * Six teams contest the fourth-tier Nancy Murray Cup (or Junior A championship), Carlow, Cavan, Monaghan, Tyrone, Westmeath, and the second team of Offaly. * Three teams contest the fifth-tier M√°ire N√≠ Chinn√©ide Cup, (or Junior B championship), Wicklow, and the second teams of Kildare and Meath. * London competed in the ((National Camogie League)) in The 2010 season although not in 2011. * Although six counties do not compete at adult level: Donegal, Fermanagh, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo and Sligo do not compete at adult level, clubs from Fermanagh, Kerry and Mayo have won honours and Donegal have contested divisional finals at under-14 Feile na nGael level. Both Louth (in 1934 and 1936) and Mayo (in 1959) have contested the All Ireland senior final in the past. *There are age-graded All Ireland championships at Minor A, Minor B, and Minor C, and Under-16 A, B and C level. =National League= The National League is staged during the winter-spring months, with four divisions of team graded by ability. =Provincial championships= Provincial championships take place at all levels, independent of the All Ireland series which has been run on an open draw basis since 1973. =International and inter-provincial= Ireland plays a camogie-shinty international against Scotland each year. The Gael Linn Cup is an inter-provincial competition played at senior and junior level. The sport is closely associated with the Celtic Congress. Two former Camogie Association presidents M√°ire N√≠ Chinn√©ide and Agnes O'Farrelly were also presidents of Celtic Congress and exhibition matches have been held at the Celtic Congress since 1938. The first such exhibition match, on the Isle of Man in 1938, marked the first appearance of Kathleen Cody, who became one of the stars of the 1940s. =Inter- collegiate= The Ashbourne and Purcell Cups and Father Meachair seven-a-side are the principal inter-collegiate competitions. =Schools= There is also a programme of provincial and All Ireland championships at secondary schools senior and junior levels, differentiated by the years of secondary school cycle, with years 4‚Äì6 competing in the senior competition, and years 1‚Äì3 competing at junior level. Cumann na mBunscoil organises competitions at primary school level. =F√©ile na nGael= Camogie competitions for club teams featuring under-14 players are played in four divisions as part of the annual F√©ile na nGael festival. The county that is selected for a particular year, all their clubs host teams from all around the country representing their county. Host clubs get families to take in two or three children for a couple of days. Records Cork have won the most Camogie All-Ireland titles with 28, the last being in 2018. Cork have won the most National Camogie League titles with 16. Awards Camogie All Stars Awards are awarded annually to the elite players who have performed best in each of the 15 positions on a traditional camogie team. Player of the year and other achievement awards have also been awarded to leading players for several decades. =Team of the Century= Picked in 2004 #Eileen Duffy-O'Mahony (Dublin) #Liz Neary (Kilkenny) #Marie Costine-O'Donovan (Cork) #Mary Sinnott-Dinan (Wexford) #Bridie Martin-McGarry (Kilkenny) #Sandie Fitzgibbon (Cork) #Margaret O'Leary- Leacy (Wexford) #Mair√©ad McAtamney-Magill (Antrim) # Linda Mellerick (Cork) # Sophie Brack (Dublin) #Kathleen Mills-Hill (Dublin) #Joni Traynor (Kilkenny) #√öna O'Connor (Dublin) #Pat Moloney-Lenihan (Cork) #Deirdre Hughes (Tipperary) #Angela Downey-Browne (Kilkenny) See also * Ashbourne Cup * Camogie All Stars Awards * Poc Fada * Women's shinty References External links * Official Camogie Association Website Category:Gaelic games Category:Sports originating in Ireland Category:Team sports ","title":"Camogie"},{"id":"73110","text":"Benedict X (died 1073/1080) was born Giovanni, a son of Guido (the youngest son of Alberic III, Count of Tusculum), a brother of the notorious Pope Benedict IX (deposed in 1048), a member of the dominant political dynasty in the region at that time. He reportedly later was given the nickname of Mincius (thin) due to his ignorance. Biography Giovanni was named Cardinal Bishop of Velletri by Pope Leo IX in 1050. He was highly esteemed, however, by those who wanted to reform the Church, and was one of five men proposed by Cardinal Frederick of Lorraine when consulted during the summer of 1057 concerning a possible successor to Pope Victor II, whom Frederick himself succeeded as Pope Stephen IX. Upon Pope Stephen's death the following year, Giovanni was elected pope on 4 April 1058, his election having been arranged by his family. This was in violation, however, of a decree by the late pope that no election was to be held until the return of Cardinal Hildebrand from a mission to Germany. Hildebrand (later Pope Gregory VII) had been sent by the late Pope Stephen to the court of Empress Agnes, who had questioned the validity of Stephen's own election. As a result, a number of cardinals alleged that the election was irregular. These cardinals were soon forced to flee Rome. When Hildebrand heard of Benedict's election during his return journey to Rome, he decided to oppose it. He went to Florence where he obtained the support of the Duke of Lorraine and Tuscany for the election of Gerhard of Burgundy, Archbishop of Florence, as pope instead. Support for this was given by Empress Agnes. Those cardinals who had opposed Benedict's election met at Siena in December 1058, and elected Gerhard, who then took the name of Nicholas II. Nicholas then proceeded towards Rome, along the way holding a synod at Sutri, where he pronounced Benedict deposed and excommunicated. The supporters of Nicholas then gained control of Rome, and forced Benedict to flee to the castle of Count Gerard of Galeria. Having arrived in Rome, Nicholas was crowned as pope on 24 January 1059. He then proceeded to wage war against Benedict and his supporters, with the assistance of Norman forces based in southern Italy, after he agreed to recognize Count Richard of Aversa as ruler of Capua. An initial battle was fought in Campagna in early 1059, which was not wholly successful for Nicholas; but later that same year, his forces conquered Praeneste, Tusculum and Numentanum, and then attacked Gal√©ria, forcing Benedict to surrender and to renounce the papacy in the Fall of that year. Benedict was allowed to go free, and he retired to one of his family's estates in the city. Pope Nicholas, however, deemed his submission inadequate and had him publicly tried in 1060, with Hildebrand serving as his prosecutor. Despite pleading that he had been forced to assume the papal crown, he was convicted that April and stripped of all his titles. He was further sentenced to confinement in the hospital attached to the Basilica of Sant'Agnese fuori le mura, where he died, still a prisoner, sometime between 1073 and 1080. He was likely buried in the adjoining church. The most important consequence of these events was the adoption of new regulations for papal elections, laid out at a synod called by Pope Nicholas in the Lateran Palace on Easter 1059. These took away the role of the Roman citizenry in the election of future popes, limiting the vote to the College of Cardinals. Additionally, the ancient title which Benedict had held of Bishop of Velletri was combined with the see of the Bishop of Ostia. (Ostia and Velletri would be separated in 1914.)

Their lineup has seen many changes over the years. To date, they have released ten studio albums. History =Early= Candice was a Rainbow fan, and first encountered Ritchie Blackmore to ask him for an autograph in 1989, while she was working for a local New York radio station. The two started living together in 1991, and discovered they both had a passionate interest in Renaissance music. During the reformed Rainbow's recording of the album Stranger in Us All in 1995, on which Night contributed some of the lyrics and backing harmony vocals, the duo were already gearing up their debut album. In 1997, the project started as being a pun of their own names, which would consist of themselves plus session musicians. =1997 to 2005= Live in Heidelberg, Germany 2002 Their debut album Shadow of the Moon was a musical success and featured Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull on flute for the song \\"Play Minstrel Play\\". In subsequent albums, particularly Fires at Midnight, there was an increased incorporation of rock guitar into the music, whilst maintaining a folk rock direction. Over time, Night has increasingly participated instrumentally as well as singing the vocals, and is competent in a wide variety of Renaissance instruments. The group performs at Renaissance fairs and Renaissance festivals, as well as in stand-alone concert tours in appropriate venues including 'castle tours' of Europe, where they perform in historic surroundings for an audience dressed largely in period costume. The duo has been successful enough to inspire a number of international tribute bands including: Renaissance Night, the Italian Morning Star and the Midnight. They have also performed the music for MagiQuest, a live simulation game. =2006‚Äìpresent= Candice Night at the House of Blues, Chicago, in 2009 In 2006, Night performed a duet with Andi Deris on Helloween's \\"Light the Universe\\", which was released as a single in certain countries and is available on their album Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy, released in the same year. On June 27, 2008, the duo released its seventh studio album called Secret Voyage, a mix of medieval-sounding tracks and some contemporary ones. In addition to some covers of some traditional folk music (‚ÄúLocked Within the Crystal Ball\\" is from the fourteenth century) and some originals, Blackmore's Night also performed a cover of a Rainbow song (‚ÄúRainbow Eyes‚Äù) and an Elvis Presley cover (\\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\"). A new album titled Autumn Sky was released at the end of 2010 in Europe and in 2011 in the U.S. This was followed by Dancer and the Moon, in 2013, an album featuring covers of songs by Randy Newman (\\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\\"), Uriah Heep (\\"Lady in Black\\") and another Rainbow song (‚ÄúTemple Of The King‚Äù, originally from the album Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow). Their latest album, All Our Yesterdays, was released on September 18, 2015. The band are said to be working on material for a new album with a possible 2020 release date.

Two highly acclaimed volumes of poetry were published during his lifetime, and in 1958 he was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. Siegel's philosophic works include Self and World: An Explanation of Aesthetic Realism and Definitions, and Comment: Being a Description of the World. His teaching of Aesthetic Realism spanned almost four decades and included thousands of extemporaneous lectures on poetry, the arts and sciences, religion, economics, and national ethics, as well as lessons to individuals and general classes which showed that questions of everyday life are aesthetic and ethical. His lecture on the poetry of William Carlos Williams, which Williams attended, is published in The Williams-Siegel Documentary and his lectures on Henry James's The Turn of the Screw were edited into a critical consideration titled James and the Children. Siegel's philosophy, and his statement, \\"The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites\\", has influenced artists, scientists, and educators. Life Born in Dvinsk, Latvia, Siegel emigrated to the United States in 1905 with his parents, Mendel and Sarah (Einhorn) Siegel. The family settled in Baltimore, Maryland, where Siegel attended Baltimore City College and joined the speech and debate team now referred to as the Bancroft/Carrollton-Wight Literary Societies. He contributed to the senior publication The Green Bag and graduated in 1919. In 1922, together with V.F. Calverton [George Goetz], he co-founded The Modern Quarterly, a magazine in which his earliest essays appeared, including \\"The Scientific Criticism\\" (Vol. I, No. 1, March 1923) and \\"The Equality of Man\\" (Vol. I, No. 3, December 1923). In 1925, his \\"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\\" was selected from four thousand anonymously submitted poemsEditors' Note, The Nation Vol. 120, No. 3110, page 148 (February 11, 1925): \\"there were 4,000 manuscripts submitted to the poetry contest.\\" as the winner of The Nation's esteemed poetry prize.Mark Van Doren in Prize Poems, 1913-1929 page 19 (NY: Charles Boni, 1930): \\"The Nation prize ... was always a spectacle to be looked forward to, and the fame which came to certain poems like Stephen Vincent Benet's \\"King David\\" and Eli Siegel's \\"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\\" was an interesting index of the importance attributed by the lay public to poetry.\\" The magazine's editors described it as \\"the most passionate and interesting poem which came in‚Äîa poem recording through magnificent rhythms a profound and important and beautiful vision of the earth on which afternoons and men have always existed.\\"Editors Oswald Garrison Villard, Lewis S. Gannett, Arthur Warner, Joseph Wood Krutch, Freda Kirchwey, and Mark Van Doren, The Nation Vol. 120, No. 3110, page 136 (February 11, 1925).Alexander Laing in \\"The Nation and its Poets,\\" page 212. The Nation, Vol. 201, No. 8 (September 20, 1965): \\"This year they chose 'Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana' because it seemed to them 'the most passionate and interesting poem that came in.'\\" The poem begins: ::Quiet and green was the grass of the field, ::The sky was whole in brightness, ::And O, a bird was flying, high, there in the sky, ::So gently, so carelessly and fairly. \\"Hot Afternoons\\" was controversial and caused an \\"editorial uproar across the country\\". The author's innovative technique in this long, free-verse poem tended to polarize commentators, with much of the polemic taking the form of parody.Deborah A. Straub in Contemporary Authors: \\"Siegel immediately became the focus of a literary controversy. His innovative technique and unorthodox approach to his material tended to polarize reviewers' reactions to the poem; as [Michael] Kernan remarked [in the Washington Post, 8/16/78], \\"some critics loved it, others were outraged.\\"Alexander Laing in \\"The Nation and its Poets,\\" page 212. The Nation, Vol. 201, No. 8 (September 20, 1965): \\"The vigor of The Nation's influence was demonstrated in an immediate editorial uproar across the country ... Much of it assumed the form of raucous parody ... This is notable because the award to Siegel helped to dramatize, for a large audience, a transition in the perception of literary values which at this midpoint of the 1920s was already evident, although still arcane. If The Nation's choice, 'Hot Afternoons,' is thought of as nothing more than a catalyst, the magazine's willingness to stand up for the unorthodox in poetry was symbolically important.\\" \\"In Hot Afternoons\\", Siegel later explained, \\"I tried to take many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and to show, in a beautiful way, that they aren't so separate and that they do have a great deal to do with one another.\\"Deborah A. Straub, Contemporary Authors: \\"Siegel composed \\"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\\" with this principle in mind, taking \\"many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and [showing], in a beautiful way, that they aren't so separate and that they do have a great deal to do with each other.\\"Corbett & Boldt: Modern American Poetry, page 144. The Macmillan Company, 1965: \\"Siegel's poetry reveals a view of reality in which 'the very self of a thing is its relation, its having-to- do-with other things.'\\" Siegel continued writing poetry throughout his life but devoted the majority of his time over the next decades to developing the philosophy he later called Aesthetic Realism. After moving to New York City, he became a member of the Greenwich Village poets, famous for his dramatic readings of \\"Hot Afternoons\\" and other poems. His two-word poem, One Question, won recognition in 1925 as the shortest poem in the English language.Baltimore Sun, April 25, 2002 It appeared in the Literary Review of the New York Evening Post : For several years in the 1930s Siegel served as master of ceremonies for regular poetry readings that were well known for combining poetry and jazz.J. Dosbriora Irwin, \\"Village Portraits\\", in Greenwich Village Weekly News May 1933, Number 33, page 3: \\"Someone told me, a few days ago, that, to-date, Eli Siegel was the most popular man on what may be termed the left wing of the Village. This is no doubt true, but Eli Siegel, as I know him, is not a politician ... He is too utterly true and too sincere to lobby, handshake or praise. Eli Siegel has another mission in life than to be popular amongst men. That mission is to be true to himself, to his soul, to his work. Hence he gains respect, which is ever so much more important than popularity. I do not mean by this that Eli Siegel shuts himself into an Ivory Tower ... no ... not exactly. He has actually many friends and his friendship is just the human exchange to give and take that real friendship should be. But because he is a little finer, a little more idealistic, more sincere than most, and because work means to him a little more, one classes him amidst the rather superior beings one is privileged to meet here and there through life, and that one can, perhaps like or love, despise or envy, but always must respect. ... Also, he composes the delicate or violent, the sentimental or humorous poems he recites evenings, and prepares the highly documented literary lectures he delivers at the Sam Johnson. For Eli Siegel is a past master at entertaining, at holding the interest of an audience, also at gathering about him men and women of talent and at encouraging them in the field of their particular endeavours. Despite the genius of his profound mind, Eli Siegel is not egoistic, but sensitive to all beauty, appreciative of all artistic expressions. He was also a regular reviewer for Scribner's magazine and the New York Evening Post Literary Review. In 1938, Siegel began teaching poetry classes with the view that \\"what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life\\". In 1941, students in these classes asked him to give individual lessons in which they might learn about their own lives. These were the first Aesthetic Realism lessons.Deborah A. Straub in Contemporary Authors: \\"Siegel continued to be preoccupied with studying and teaching the new philosophy of life and art he had begun to develop in the 1920s and 1930s. Known first as Aesthetic Analysis and later as Aesthetic Realism, this philosophy sprang from Siegel's belief that \\"what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life...\\" In 1944, Siegel married Martha Baird (University of Iowa), who had begun studying in his classes the year before. Baird would later become Secretary of the Society for Aesthetic Realism, and also a musicologist and poet in her own right. In 1946, at Steinway Hall in New York City, Siegel began giving weekly lectures in which he presented the philosophy he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism) \\"a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier\\".Donald Kirkley in \\"Poet Outlines a Philosophy,\\" Baltimore Sun, August 2, 1946: \\"More than 160 persons ... attended the introductory talk. Subsequent lectures will be given weekly at Steinway Hall. Tonight's theme was \\"Self and World.\\" In it, Mr. Siegel affirmed his belief that \\"aesthetic analysis can be of help to everybody.\\" It is, he said, 'a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.'\\" From 1941 to 1978, he gave many thousand lectures on poetry, history, economics‚Äîa wide variety of the arts and sciences. And he gave thousands of individual Aesthetic Realism lessons to men, women, and children. In these lessons the way of seeing the world based on aesthetics‚Äîwhich is Aesthetic Realism‚Äîwas taught. In 1951, William Carlos Williams read Siegel's \\"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana\\" again, and wrote to Martha Baird: \\"Everything we most are compelled to do is in that one poem.\\" Siegel, he wrote, \\"belongs in the very first rank of our living artists\\".William Carlos Williams, Something to Say, ed J. E. B. Breslin pages 249, 251 (New Directions, 1985): \\"I can't tell you how important Siegel's work is in the light of my present understanding of the modern poem. He belongs in the very first rank of our living artists....Everything we most are compelled to do is in that one poem.\\" The prize poem became the title poem of Siegel's first volume, Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana: Poems, nominated for a National Book Award in 1958.URL: A decade later, his second volume, Hail, American Development, also met with critical acclaim. \\"I think it's about time Eli Siegel was moved up into the ranks of our acknowledged Leading Poets\\", wrote Kenneth Rexroth in the New York Times.Kenneth Rexroth reviewing Hail, American Development, (March 23, 1969) Walter Leuba described Siegel's poems as \\"alive in a burning honesty and directness\\" and yet, having \\"exquisite emotional tact\\". He pointed to these lines from \\"Dear Birds, Tell This to Mothers\\":Walter Leuba in New Mexico Quarterly, Vol. XXVII, No. 3, Autumn, 1957 (University of New Mexico): \\"[H]e never once betrayed a false attitude. Alive in a burning honesty and directness, he had none to betray....He is at every step the poet and his directness and mastery of technical devices allow him frequent perfections. He is not mannered and he does not write for effect. Everything he writes is emotionally honest and therefore of interest...[T]he number of consummate poems and passages is extraordinary. Everywhere there is an exquisite emotional tact: \\"Find the lost lines in/The writing that is your child, mothers. . . .\\" At the age of 76 Siegel had an operation for a benign prostatic condition. He called it \\"the operation so disastrous to me\\". As a result, he lost the use of his feet and was unable to sleep. According to Ellen Reiss, Aesthetic Realism Chairman of Education, the operation was \\"the cause of his dying 5-1/2 months later\\".Ellen Reiss, \\"Always:Love of Reality,\\" The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known, #1626 (3 November 2004) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro1626.html. Aesthetic Realism The basis of Aesthetic Realism is the principle, \\"The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.\\" In the book Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There, six working artists explain this principle in life and their own craft. Reviewing them, the Library Journal tells us: \\"Heraclitus, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and even Martin Buber have posited contraries and polarities in their philosophies. Siegel, however, seems to be the first to demonstrate that 'all beauty is the making one of the permanent opposites in reality'.\\" (September 1, 1969) The ethics Siegel taught‚Äî\\"the art of enjoying justice\\"‚Äîincludes this definition of good will: \\"The desire to have something else stronger and more beautiful, for this desire makes oneself stronger and more beautiful.\\" Good will is necessary, he stated, for a person to like him‚Äì or herself: \\"This desire is the fundamental thing in human consciousness.\\" (The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known, issue no. 121) The Aesthetic Realism Foundation continues to teach the philosophy that Siegel founded. The Aesthetic Realism Online Library publishes poems, essays, definitions, lectures, and reviews by Eli Siegel.

Huntington Cairns, Secretary of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., described Siegel's place in the understanding of aesthetics‚Äîthe branch of philosophy which studies beauty‚Äîas follows: > I believe that Eli Siegel was a genius. He did for aesthetics what Spinoza > did for ethics. Donald Kirkley wrote in the Baltimore Sun (1944) reporting on Siegel's reaction to his 1925 national fame, > Baltimore friends close to him at the time will testify to a certain > integrity and steadfastness of purpose which distinguished Mr. Siegel ... He > refused to exploit a flood of publicity which was enough to float any man to > financial comfort ... And William Carlos Williams also wrote, > Only today do I realize how important that poem [Hot Afternoons Have Been in > Montana] is in the history of our development as a cultural entity. In 2002 the city of Baltimore placed a plaque in Druid Hill Park to commemorate the centennial of Eli Siegel's birth. That same year Representative Elijah E. Cummings read a tribute to Siegel in the United States House of Representatives. Epitaph The following are lines from Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana, one of the poems which Selden Rodman commented \\"say more (and more movingly) about here and now than any contemporary poems I have read\\".

As a student of G. W. F. Hegel, Bauer was a radical Rationalist in philosophy, politics and Biblical criticism. Bauer investigated the sources of the New Testament and, beginning with Hegel's Hellenophile orientation, concluded that early Christianity owed more to ancient Greek philosophy (Stoicism) than to Judaism.see Bauer's work \\"Christus und die Caesaren\\" (English: Christ and the Caesars) Bruno Bauer is also known by his association and sharp break with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and by his later association with Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche. Starting in 1840, he began a series of works arguing that Jesus was a 2nd-century fusion of Jewish, Greek, and Roman theology.Durant, Will. Caesar and Christ. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972  Biography  Bauer was the son of a painter in a porcelain factory and his wife at Eisenberg in Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He studied at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin from spring 1828 to spring 1832. He became associated with the so-called Right Hegelians under Philip Marheineke, who engaged Bauer years later to edit the second edition of Hegel's Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion 1818‚Äì1832. This was to become one of Bauer's best-known works‚Äîa three-volume, critical edition. In 1834 he began to teach in Berlin as a licentiate of theology, and in 1839 was transferred to the University of Bonn. In 1838 he published his Kritische Darstellung der Religion des Alten Testaments (Critical Exhibition of the Religion of the Old Testament) in two volumes. This work showed Bauer was faithful to the Hegelian Rationalist theology that interpreted all miracles in Naturalistic terms. Consistent with his Hegelian Rationalism, Bauer continued in 1840 with, Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte des Johannes (Critique of the Evangelical History of John). In 1841 Bauer continued his Rationalist theme with, Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker (Critique of the Evangelical History of the Synoptics). At no time in his writing was Bauer ever an orthodox Christian. From his earliest days of academic scholarship under Hegel, Bauer maintained a firm criticism of Immanuel Kant and a firm fealty to both Hegel's dialectic and his Rationalist Theology. Accused of being a so-called \\"Right Hegelian\\" (cf. David Strauss, In Defense of My 'Life of Jesus' Against the Hegelians, 1838), he was later accused of being a \\"Left Hegelian\\" because of his association, or rather his early leadership, of the Young Hegelians. Yet the labels of 'Left' and 'Right' were only placed on Bruno Bauer by others; never by himself. Bauer considered himself simply a Hegelian. From 1839 to 1841, Bauer was a teacher, mentor and close friend of Karl Marx, but in 1841 they came to a break. Marx, with Friedrich Engels, had formulated a socialist and communistic programme that Bruno Bauer firmly rejected. Marx and Engels in turn expressed their break with Bauer in two books: The Holy Family (1845) and The German Ideology (1846). The Prussian Minister of Education, Altenstein, sent Bauer to the University of Bonn, to protect his Rationalist Theology from the critique of the Berlin orthodox, as well as to win over Bonn University to Hegelianism. Bauer, however, created many enemies at pietist-dominated Bonn university, where he openly taught Rationalism in his new position as professor of theology. Bauer attested in letters during this time that he tried to provoke a scandal, to force the government either to give complete freedom of science and teaching to its university professors, or to openly express its anti-enlightenment position by removing him from his post. The pro-Hegelian minister Altenstein had died and been replaced by the anti- Hegelian Eichhorn. The government officials asked for advice from the theology departments of its universities. Except for the Hegelian Marheineke, most said that a professor of Protestant theology should not be allowed to teach \\"atheism\\" to his student priests. As Bauer was unwilling to compromise his Rationalism, the Prussian government in 1842 revoked his teaching license. After the setbacks of the revolutions of 1848, Bauer left the city. He lived an ascetic and stoic life in the countryside of Rixdorf near Berlin. Bauer continued to write, including more than nine theological tomes, in twelve lengthy volumes. His lengthy volumes varied between theology, modern history and politics. He published them at his own expense while working at his family's tobacco shop. Between 1843 and 1845 Bauer published Geschichte der Politik, Kultur und Aufkl√§rung des 18ten Jahrhunderts (History of Politics, Culture and Enlightenment in the 18th Century, in 4 volumes). In 1847 Bauer published Geschichte der franz√∂sischen Revolution (History of the French Revolution, in 3 volumes). Between 1850 and 1852 Bauer published Kritik der Evangelien und Geschichte ihres Ursprungs (A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin), as well as Kritik der paulinischen Briefe (Critique of the Pauline Epistles). In these works Bauer led the academic movement to subject the Bible to historical and literary criticism. In 1877 Bauer published Christus und die Caesaren (Christ and the Caesars), and in 1882 he published Disraelis romantischer und Bismarcks socialistischer Imperialismus (Disraeli's Romantic and Bismarck's Socialist Imperialism). Bauer's final book on theology, Christ and the Caesars (1877), was his crowning effort to justify Hegel's position that Christian theology owed at least as much to Greco-Roman classical philosophy as it owed to Judaism. Bruno Bauer died at Rixdorf in 1882. His younger brother, Edgar, was a German left-wing journalist who had supported his brother's fights and was sent to prison for his political positions. He later became a police spy in London for the Danish government, reporting about Karl Marx, among others.  Conflict with David Strauss  Shortly after the death of Hegel, another writer, David Strauss, who had been a reader of Hegel's writings, arrived in Berlin (1831). As a student of Friedrich Schleiermacher he wrote a controversial book which is now famous, entitled, The Life of Jesus Critically Examined, usually referred to as The Life of Jesus (1835). In this book David Strauss announced his own landmark theory of 'demythologization' as an approach to the Gospels, but he also attempted to use Hegel's name and fame in his book as a marketing ploy. In the year of its publication, Strauss' book raised a storm of controversy. The Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm IV tightened control of the Prussian University system, favoring his ultra-conservative approach to the Bible. He objected to the writing of David Strauss, and he also mistakenly believed that the Hegelian school in general was its source. Bauer, at 26 years of age, was chosen by the Hegelians to refute David Strauss in the Hegelian Journal f√ºr wissenschaftliche Kritik (Journal of Philosophical Criticism). Bauer ably showed that Strauss misrepresented Hegel, and that Strauss' position differed significantly from Hegel's. Bauer also demonstrated that David Strauss' so- called dialectic was taken from Schleiermacher (who had been antagonistic toward Hegel). Although Strauss' book had sold well throughout Europe, in 1838 Strauss published a rebuttal to Bruno Bauer in a booklet entitled, In Defense of my Life of Jesus against the Hegelians. In that book Strauss admitted publicly that his position had not been inspired by Hegel's philosophy after all, nor by Hegel's theological position (which advocated a dialectical Trinity). Strauss divorced himself from the Hegelians with this booklet, and never joined their ranks again. However, in this final exchange with the Hegelians, he criticised the Hegelian school in a way that has become unforgettable. In that booklet David Strauss invented terms still in use today: a Right Hegelian would uncritically defend all positions of orthodox Christian theology, he said, while a Left Hegelian takes a liberal and progressive approach to Scripture. A \\"Centrist Hegelian\\" would take the middle road and try to honor both: whatever was rational in theological thinking as well as free scientific thought. The Prussian monarch, objecting to these debates, banned many Hegelians from teaching in Universities, including Bruno Bauer. For the rest of his life, Bauer continued to be bitter towards Strauss. When Bauer was middle-aged, a youthful Friedrich Nietzsche came to visit him , seeking advice from a well-known author. Bauer encouraged Nietzsche to criticize Strauss, and in that early period, that is what young Nietzsche did. Nietzsche in turn mentions later that Bauer was \\"my entire reading public\\".Nietzsche, Friedrich, Genealogy of Morals and Ecce Homo, Ecce Homo, page 278 (Random House: Vintage Books Edition, 1989, Walter Kaufmann, ed.)  Views on Christian origins  Bauer wrote criticism of the New Testament. David Strauss, in his Life of Jesus, had accounted for the Gospel narratives as half-conscious products of the mythic instinct in the early Christian communities. Bauer ridiculed Strauss's notion that a community could produce a connected narrative. Rather, only a single writer could be responsible for the first Gospel. His own contention, embodying a theory of Christian Gottlob Wilke (Der Urevangelist, 1838), was that the original narrative was the Gospel of Mark. For Bauer, the Gospel of Mark was completed in the reign (117‚Äì138) of Hadrian (where its prototype, the 'Ur-Marcus,' identifiable within the Gospel of Mark by a critical analysis, was begun around the time of Josephus and the Roman‚ÄìJewish Wars). Bauer, like other advocates of this 'Marcan Hypothesis', affirmed that all the other Gospel narratives used the Gospel of Mark as their model within their writing communities. In 1906 Albert Schweitzer wrote that Bauer \\"originally sought to defend the honor of Jesus by rescuing his reputation from the inane parody of a biography that the Christian apologists had forged.\\" However, he eventually came to the belief that it was a complete fiction and \\"regarded the Gospel of Mark not only as the first narrator, but even as the creator of the gospel history, thus making the latter a fiction and Christianity the invention of a single original evangelist\\" (Otto Pfleiderer). Although Bauer investigated the 'Ur-Marcus', it was his remarks on the current version of the Gospel of Mark that captured popular attention. In particular, some key themes in the Gospel of Mark appeared to be literary. The Messianic Secret theme, in which Jesus continually performed wonders and then continually told the viewers not to tell anybody that he did this, seemed to Bauer to be an example of fiction. If the Messianic Secret is a fiction, Bauer wrote, the redactor who added that theme was probably the final redactor of our current version of the Gospel of Mark. In 1901, Wilhelm Wrede would make his lasting fame by repeating many of Bauer's ideas in his book, The Messianic Secret. Also, for some influential theologians in the T√ºbingen School, several Pauline epistles were regarded as forgeries of the 2nd century. Bauer radicalised that position by suggesting that all Pauline epistles were forgeries written in the West in antagonism to the Paul of The Acts. Bauer observed a preponderance of the Greco-Roman element over the Jewish element in Christian writings, and he added a wealth of historical background to support his theory. However, modern scholars such as E. P. Sanders and John P. Meier have disputed the theory and attempted to demonstrate a mainly Jewish historical background. Other authors, such as Rudolf Bultmann, tended to agree that a Greco-Roman element was dominant. According to Bauer, the writer of Mark's gospel was \\"an Italian, at home both in Rome and Alexandria\\"; Matthew's gospel was written by \\"a Roman, nourished by the spirit of Seneca\\"; and Christianity is essentially \\"Stoicism triumphant in a Jewish garb.\\" What Bauer added was a deep review of European literature in the 1st century. In his estimation, many key themes of the New Testament, especially those that are opposed to themes in the Old Testament, can be found with relative ease in Greco-Roman literature that flourished during the 1st century. Such a position was also maintained by some Jewish scholars. Bauer's final book, Christ and the Caesars (1877) offers a penetrating analysis that shows common keywords in the words of 1st-century writers like Seneca the Stoic and New Testament texts. While that had been perceived even in ancient times, the ancient explanation was that Seneca 'must have been' a secret Christian. Bauer was perhaps the first to attempt to demonstrate carefully that some New Testament writers freely borrowed from Seneca the Stoic. One modern explanation is that common cultures share common thought forms and common patterns of speech, and similarities do not necessarily indicate borrowing. In Christ and the Caesars, Bauer argued that Judaism entered Rome during the era of the Maccabees and increased in population and influence in Rome since then. He cited literature from the 1st century to strengthen his case that Jewish influence in Rome was far greater than historians had yet reported. The imperial throne was influenced by the Jewish religious genius, he said, citing Herod's relation with the Caesar family, as well as the famous relationship between Josephus and the Flavians, Vespasian and Titus, and also one of the poems of Horace. According to Bauer, Julius Caesar sought to interpret his own life as an Oriental miracle story, and Augustus Caesar completed that job by commissioning Virgil to write his Aeneid, making Caesar into the Son of Venus and a relative of the Trojans, thereby justifying the Roman conquest of Greece and insinuating Rome into a much older history. By contrast, said Bauer, Vespasian was far more fortunate since he had Josephus himself to link his reign with an Oriental miracle. Josephus had prophesied that Vespasian would become Emperor of Rome and thus ruler of the world. That actually happened and so the Roman conquest of Judea was justified and insinuated Rome into an even older history. According to Albert Schweitzer, Bauer's criticisms of the New Testament provided the most interesting questions about the historical Jesus that he had seen.Schweitzer, Albert, The Quest of the Historical Jesus ‚Äì 1906 ‚Äì Adam and Charles Black, on p.159, Schweitzer explicitly states, \\"Bauer's 'Criticism of the Gospel History' is worth a good dozen Lives of Jesus, because his work, as we are only now coming to recognise, after half a century, is the ablest and most complete collection of the difficulties of the Life of Jesus which is anywhere to be found.\\" The second-last chapter of his Quest suggests that Schweitzer's own theology was partly based on Bauer's writings. The title of that chapter is \\"Thoroughgoing Skepticism and Eschatology\\" in which Schweitzer clashes head-on with Wilhelm Wrede, who had recently (in 1905) proposed the theory of a Messianic Secret. Wrede's theory claimed that Jesus' continual commands to his followers to \\"say nothing to anybody\\" after each miracle was performed could be explained only as a literary invention of this Gospel writer. (That is, Wrede was the thoroughgoing skeptic, and Schweitzer was the thoroughgoing eschatologist.) Schweitzer began by showing that Wrede had merely copied the idea from Bauer. Then, 40 listed another forty brilliant criticisms from Bauer (pp. 334‚Äì335) and disagreed with some of them (such as the so-called Messianic Secret) and considered others indispensable for any modern theology of the Gospel. That line of criticism has value in emphasizing the importance of studying the influence of environment in the formation of the Christian Scriptures. Bauer was a man of restless creativity, interdisciplinary activity and independent judgment. Many reviewers have charged that Bauer's judgment was ill-balanced. Because of the controversial nature of his work as a social theorist, theologian and historian, Bauer was banned from public teaching by a Prussian monarch. After many years of similar censorship, Bauer came to resign himself to his place as a freelance critic, rather than an official teacher. Douglas Moggach published The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer in 2003. It is the most comprehensive overview of Bauer's life and works in English to date. Bauer's biography has now obtained more kindly reviews, even by opponents. In his own day, his opponents often respected him since he was not afraid of taking a line on principle. One point that is often raised regard is his line that was displeasing to his liberal friends on the Jewish question (Die Judenfrage, 1843). Bauers later article, \\"Jews abroad\\" (Das Judentum in der Fremde) in \\"Staats- und Gesellschaftslexicon\\", was even more radical and extensive by mixing arguments of racism, religion and \\"v√∂lkisch\\" ideology. The topic of Bauer's personal religious views or lack thereof is a continuing debate in contemporary scholarship about Bauer. One modern writer, Paul Trejo (2002), has made the case that Bauer remained a radical theologian who criticized specific types of Christianity and that Bauer maintained a Hegelian interpretation of Christianity throughout his life. According to Trejo, Bauer's book Christianity Exposed (1843) was very mild by setting only one sect of Christian against another. Trejo thought Bauer's Trumpet of the Last Judgment against Hegel the Atheist and Antichrist to have been a comedy, actually a prank, in which Bauer pretended to be a right-wing cleric who was attacking Hegel. When many right-wing readers publicly praised the book, Bauer revealed himself as the actual author and had a good laugh. The Trumpet, written by Bauer and published anonymously, was of inspiration to Gianfranco Sanguinetti for his 1975 pamphlet Veritable Report on the Last Chances to Save Capitalism in Italy, a Situationist prank that caused him to leave Italy by political pressure.Bauer citation, report of scandal. Antisemitism Beginning in 1848, critics accused Bauer of promoting a virulent antisemitism in print within reactionary circles.Moggach, Douglas, The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003) p. 17 Bauer's view of Jews and Judaism is considered by some to have been absolutely negative, both when considering the past and when contemplating the present.Katz, Jacob, From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700‚Äì1933 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980) p. 214 In 1843, Bauer wrote The Jewish Question, which was responded to in a pamphlet written by Karl Marx, entitled, \\"On the Jewish Question\\". According to Marx, Bauer argued that the Jews were responsible for their own misfortunes in European society since they had \\"made their nest in the pores and interstices of bourgeois society\\".Poliakov, Leon, The History of Anti-Semitism, Volume III: From Voltaire to Wagner (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2003) p. 420 Jacob Katz contextualizes Bauer's antisemitism with his passionate anti- Christianity, the latter of which caused Bauer to lose his professorship. Although, according to Katz, Bauer was \\"equally impatient with Christianity and Judaism\\",Katz, Jacob. From prejudice to destruction: anti-Semitism, 1700‚Äì1933. page 169 Bauer would frequently diverge from a review or opinion piece on a Jewish writer or thinker into a general consideration of \\"the Jew as a type\\", grasping at whatever negative characteristics he could find.Katz, Jacob. From prejudice to destruction: anti-Semitism, 1700‚Äì1933. page 214-5 Political ideology The first English-language rendering of Bruno Bauer's career was published in March, 2003 by Douglas Moggach, a professor at the University of Ottawa. His book is entitled, The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer. Professor Moggach develops a republican interpretation of Bruno Bauer, in which Bauer is portrayed as reaching atheist conclusions because of his political commitments to free self-consciousness and autonomy, and his criticisms of the Restoration union of church and state. Other scholars continue to dispute that portrait. Bauer's personality was complex. During his career and even after he died he was difficult to classify. The left-wing tried to define him as one of their own. The right-wing tried to define him as one of their own. He was praised by the right-Hegelians, and he was praised by the left-Hegelians. Bauer had studied directly under Hegel. Hegel had awarded an academic prize to Bauer when Bauer was about 20 years old. Hegel died when Bruno Bauer was 22 years old. Perhaps this affected Bauer's personality strongly; he may have seen himself as sitting very close to the highest academic post in Prussia and possibly he imagined that he would one day have that post. When Hegel unexpectedly died in 1831, possibly of cholera, Bruno Bauer's official connections were drastically reduced. Bauer had very few powerful friends during the academic fallout after Hegel's death. After the publication of his 'The Trumpet' (1841) he was considered as an important representative of the radicals. The struggle with David Strauss and especially with the Prussian monarchy had set Bruno Bauer back quite a bit. This also affected Bauer's personality. Bauer went underground and began to write Hegelian newspapers here and there. In this journey he met some socialists, including Karl Marx, his former student, and Marx' new friends, Friedrich Engels and Arnold Ruge. They were all left-wing radicals. Bauer was not a left-wing radical, but he was happy to be their leader if it could lead them back to a Hegelian understanding of the dialectic. Another member of those Young Hegelians, Max Stirner, became Bauer's lifelong friend. Although Bauer was not a radical egoist, he preferred the writings of Stirner to the writings of Marx, Engels and Ruge. Shortly after, Marx and Engels broke sharply with Bruno Bauer and attacked him specifically in a critique of one of his works, \\"On the Jewish Question.\\" The two new works by Marx and Engels that were critical of several Young Hegelians, including Bauer, were The Holy Family, and The German Ideology. Bruno Bauer met with Marx again in London in the mid-1850s, while visiting his exiled brother Edgar there. According to Marx's correspondence with Engels, Bauer presented him with a copy of Hegel's Science of Logic. Marx referred to this volume while completing his drafts of 'Capital'. Bauer had already turned away from the socialism and communism of Marx and Engels, so he was immune to the barbs they wrote in The Holy Family or Critique of Critical Criticism. Against Bruno Bauer and Company by his pupils, Marx and Engels. Nevertheless, he had fallen quite far ‚Äì from a favorite son of Hegel himself down to an enemy of both the right-wing and the left-wing as well. He found very few friends in this intellectual position aside from Max Stirner. According to some sources he contemplated suicide.http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/index.htm According to other sources, his enemies only wished that he contemplated suicide. Suppressed and condemned by both the right-wing and the left-wing, the once-influential Bruno Bauer finally settled into his family's tobacco shop to earn his living, though he continued to write. He never married, but he wrote books for the rest of his life.  Revival  Bauer's scholarship was buried by German academia, and he remained a pariah, until Albert Kalthoff rescued his works from neglect and obscurity. Kalthoff revived Bauer's Christ Myth thesis in his Das Christus-Problem. Grundlinien zu einer Sozialtheologie (The Problem of Christ: Principles of a Social Theology, 1902) and Die Entstehung des Christentums, Neue Beitr√§ge zum Christusproblem (The Rise of Christianity, 1904). Albert Schweitzer a historian of theology, who presented an important critical review of the history of the search for Jesus's life in Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung (The Quest of the Historical Jesus, 1906), highly praised Bauer's early work. Arthur Drews noted Bauer's views in his own work The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present, \\"Christianity is the product of the intimidated class of Romans who needed a straw of hope and faith in their struggle against the egoism of Caesars. It's absurd to suppose it to be originating from Hierosolyma [Jerusalem]. The origin of the Gospel literature is then reexamined. Originally, it's just a demonstration of the new principle of freedom, in rebellion against the law-dominated world, represented by Judaism. The Gospels demonstrate various steps in the evolution of this esteem. The main factor of influence was of the Roman empire, whose oppression forced the community to look for hope in a kingdom of heavens and exterminating the kingdom of Rome to make it possible. ...Absolutely no such thing as a historical Jesus of Galilee is needed to explain the genesis of Mark's gospel.\\" Modern scholar Robert M. Price wrote: > Reading the prescient Bruno Bauer one has the eerie feeling that a century > of New Testament scholarship may find itself ending up where it began. For > instance, the work of Burton Mack, Vernon Robbins, and others makes a > powerful case for understanding the gospels as Cynic-Stoic in tone.... > Robert M.

Argument against the existence of Jesus  Bauer became the first author to systematically argue that Jesus did not exist.Robert E. Van Voorst Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. pages 7-11Beilby, James K. and Eddy, Paul Rhodes. \\"The Quest for the Historical Jesus\\", in James K. Beilby and Paul Rhodes Eddy (eds.). The Historical Jesus: Five Views. Intervarsity, 2009, p. 16. * See Strauss, David. \\"The Life of Jesus Critically Examined, Calvin Blanchard, 1860. Beginning in 1841, in his Criticism of the Gospel History of the Synoptics, Bauer argued that the Biblical Jesus was primarily a literary figure. However, he left open the question of whether a historical Jesus existed at all until his 1851 work, Criticism of the Gospels and History of their Origin and then in 1877 proposed his theory for the true origin of Jesus in Christ and the Caesars. Bauer's 1842 work, Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker und des Johannes (3 vol) argued that the gospels were purely literary, with no historically authentic material. While not yet rejecting the historicity of Jesus, Bauer denied the historicity of a supernatural Christ (viz. Jesus‚Äîa natural human). Bauer wrote, \\"Everything that the historical Christ is, everything that is said of Him, everything that is known of Him, belongs to the world of imagination, that is, of the imagination of the Christian community, and therefore has nothing to do with any man who belongs to the real world.\\" (see David Strauss (1808‚Äì1874) who pioneered the search for the \\"Historical Jesus\\" by also rejecting the supernatural events of \\"The Christ\\", in his 1835 work, Life of Jesus). In his Criticism of the Pauline Epistles (1850‚Äì1852) and in A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin (1850‚Äì1851), Bauer argued that Jesus had not existed.Schweitzer, Albert. The Quest of the Historical Jesus. Fortress, 2001; first published 1913, pp. 124‚Äì128, 139‚Äì141. Schweitzer notes, \\"At the end of his study of the Gospels, Bauer is inclined to make the decision of the question whether there ever was a historic Jesus depend on the result of a further investigation which he proposed to make into the Pauline Epistles. It was not until ten years later (1850‚Äì1851) that he accomplished this task, (Kritik der Paidinischen Briefe. (Criticism of the Pauline Epistles.) Berlin, 1850-1852.) and applied the result in his new edition of the \\"Criticism of the Gospel History.\\" (Kritik der Evangelien und Geschichte ihres Ursprungs. (Criticism of the Gospels and History of their Origin.) 2 vols., Berlin, 1850‚Äì1851.) The result is negative: there never was any historical Jesus.\\" In Christ and the Caesars (1877) he suggested that Christianity was a synthesis of the Stoicism of Seneca the Younger and of the Jewish theology of Philo as developed by pro-Roman Jews such as Josephus.Moggach, Douglas. The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer. Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 184. *Also see Engels, Frederick. \\"Bruno Bauer and Early Christianity\\", Der Sozialdemokrat, May 1882. Bauer's work was heavily criticized at the time; in 1839 he was removed from his position at the University of Bonn, and his work did not have much impact on future myth theorists.In Search of Jesus: Insider and Outsider Images by Clinton Bennett (Dec 1, 2001) Continuum page 204 Christ myth theory proponents still assert the threefold argument originally asserted by Bauer: * that the New Testament has no historical value. * that there are no non-Christian references to Jesus Christ dating back to the first century. * that Christianity had pagan or mythical roots.

The term can be applied in two ways: * Seigniorage derived from specie (metal coins) is a tax added to the total cost of a coin (metal content and production costs) that a customer of the mint had to pay, and which was sent to the sovereign of the political region. * Seigniorage derived from notes is more indirect; it is the difference between interest earned on securities acquired in exchange for banknotes and the cost of producing and distributing the notes. \\"Monetary seigniorage\\" is where sovereign-issued securities are exchanged for newly- printed banknotes by a central bank, allowing the sovereign to \\"borrow\\" without needing to repay. Monetary seigniorage is sovereign revenue obtained through routine debt monetization, including expansion of the money supply during GDP growth and meeting yearly inflation targets. Seigniorage can be a convenient source of revenue for a government. By providing the government with increased purchasing power at the expense of public purchasing power, it imposes what is metaphorically known as an inflation tax on the public. Examples Seigniorage is the positive return, or carry, on issued notes and coins (money in circulation). Demurrage, the opposite, is the cost of holding currency. An example of an exchange of gold for \\"paper\\" where no seigniorage occurs is when a person has one ounce of gold, trades it for a government- issued gold certificate (providing for redemption in one ounce of gold), keeps that certificate for a year, and redeems it in gold. That person began with and ends up with exactly one ounce of gold. In another scenario, instead of issuing gold certificates a government converts gold into non-gold standard based currency at the market rate by printing paper notes. A person exchanges one ounce of gold for its value in currency, keeps the currency for one year, and exchanges it for an amount of gold at the new market value. If the value of the currency relative to gold has changed in the interim, the second exchange will yield more (or less) than one ounce of gold (assuming that the value, or purchasing power, of one ounce of gold remains constant through the year). If the value of the currency relative to gold has decreased, the person receives less than one ounce of gold and seigniorage occurred. If the value of the currency relative to gold has increased, the person receives more than one ounce of gold; seigniorage did not occur. Ordinary seigniorage Ordinarily, seigniorage is an interest-free loan (of gold, for example) to the issuer of the coin or banknote. When the currency is worn out the issuer buys it back at face value, balancing the revenue received when it was put into circulation without any additional amount for the interest value of what the issuer received. Historically, seigniorage was the profit resulting from producing coins. Silver and gold were mixed with base metals to make durable coins. The British pound sterling was 92.5 percent silver; the base metal added (and the pure silver retained by the government mint) was, less costs, the profit ‚Äì the seigniorage. Before 1933, United States gold coins were 90 percent gold and 10 percent copper. To make up for the lack of gold, the coins were over-weighted. A one-ounce Gold American Eagle will have as much of the alloy as needed to contain a total of one ounce of gold (which will be over one ounce). Seigniorage is earned by selling the coins above the melt value in exchange for guaranteeing the weight of the coin. Under the rules governing the monetary operations of major central banks (including the Federal Reserve), seigniorage on banknotes is the interest payments received by central banks on the total amount of currency issued. This usually takes the form of interest payments on treasury bonds purchased by central banks, putting more dollars into circulation. If the currency is collected, or is otherwise taken permanently out of circulation, the currency is never returned to the central bank; the issuer of the currency keeps the seigniorage profit by not having to buy back worn-out currency at face value. =Solvency constraints of central banks= The solvency constraint of a standard central bank requires that the present discounted value of its net non-monetary liabilities (separate from monetary liabilities accrued through seigniorage attempts) be zero or negative in the long run. Its monetary liabilities are liabilities in name only, since they are irredeemable. The holder of base money cannot insist on the redemption of a given amount into anything other than the same amount of itself, unless the holder of the base money is another central bank reclaiming the value of its original interest-free loan. Seigniorage as a tax Economists regard seigniorage as a form of inflation tax, returning resources to the currency issuer. Issuing new currency, rather than collecting taxes paid with existing money, is considered a tax on holders of existing currency. Inflation of the money supply causes a general rise in prices, due to the currency's reduced purchasing power. This is a reason offered in support of free banking, a gold or silver standard, or (at a minimum) the reduction of political control of central banks, which could then ensure currency stability by controlling monetary expansion (limiting inflation). Hard-money advocates argue that central banks have failed to attain a stable currency. Orthodox economists counter that deflation is difficult to control once it sets in, and its effects are more damaging than modest, consistent inflation. Banks (or governments) relying heavily on seigniorage and fractional reserve sources of revenue may find them counterproductive.Tara McIndoe-Calder, Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe: Money Demand, Seigniorage and Aid shocks, Central Bank of Ireland; University of Dublin - Institute for International Integration Studies, May 1, 2009 Rational expectations of inflation take into account a bank's seigniorage strategy, and inflationary expectations can maintain high inflation. Instead of accruing seigniorage from fiat money and credit, most governments opt to raise revenue primarily through formal taxation and other means Contemporary use The 50 State Quarters series of quarters (25-cent coins) began in 1999. The U.S. government thought that many people, collecting each new quarter as it rolled out of the United States Mint, would remove the coins from circulation.United States Mint 50 State Quarters¬Æ Design Use Policy, Usmint.gov, Retrieved December 5, 2013 Each complete set of quarters (the 50 states, the five inhabited U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia) is worth $14.00. Since it costs the mint about five cents to produce one quarter, the government made a profit when someone collected a coin. The Treasury Department estimates that it earned about $6.3 billion in seigniorage from the quarters during the program. Some countries' national mints report the amount of seigniorage provided to their governments; the Royal Canadian Mint reported that in 2006 it generated $93 million in seigniorage for the government of Canada. The U.S. government, the largest beneficiary of seignorage, earned about $25 billion in 2000. For coins only, the U.S. Treasury received 45 cents per dollar issued in seigniorage for the 2011 fiscal year.United States Mint FY 2013 President‚Äôs Budget Submission United States Treasury Occasionally, central banks have issued limited quantities of higher-value banknotes in unusual denominations for collecting; the denomination will usually coincide with an anniversary of national significance. The potential seigniorage from such printings has been limited, since the unusual denomination makes the notes more difficult to circulate and only a relatively-small number of people collect higher-value notes. Over half of Zimbabwe's government revenue in 2008 was reportedly seigniorage. The country has experienced hyperinflation, with an annualized rate of about 24,000 percent in July 2008 (prices doubling every 46 days). International circulation The international circulation of banknotes is a profitable form of seignorage. Although the cost of printing banknotes is minimal, the foreign entity must provide goods and services at the note's face value. The banknote is retained as a store of value, since the entity values it more than the local currency. Foreign circulation generally involves large-value banknotes, and can be used for private transactions (some of which are illegal). American currency has been circulating globally for most of the 20th century, and the amount of currency in circulation increased several-fold during World War II. Large-scale printing of the United States one hundred-dollar bill began when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991; production quadrupled, with the first trillion-dollar printing of the bill. At the end of 2008, U.S. currency in public circulation amounted to $824 billion and 76 percent of the currency supply was in the form of $100 bills (twenty $100 bills per U.S. citizen). The amount of U.S. currency circulating abroad is controversial. According to Porter and Judson,Porter and Judson, 1996, R. D. Porter and R. A. Judson, The location of U.S. currency: How much is abroad? Federal Reserve Bulletin 82 (1996), pp. 883‚Äì903 53 to 67 percent was overseas during the mid-1990s. Feige estimates that about 40 percent is abroad. In a New York Federal Reserve publication, GoldbergGoldberg, 2010, L. S. Goldberg, Is the International Role of the Dollar Changing? Federal Reserve Bank Of New York, Current Issues in Economics and Finance, 16(1) (2010) pp. 1‚Äì7. writes that \\"about 65 percent ($580 billion) of all banknotes are in circulation outside of the country\\". These figures are largely contradicted by Federal Reserve Board of Governors Flow of Funds statistics, which indicate that $313 billion (36.7 percent) of U.S. currency was held abroad at the end of March 2009. Feige calculates that since 1964, \\"the cumulative seigniorage earnings accruing to the U.S. by virtue of the currency held by foreigners amounted to $167‚Äì$185 billion and over the past two decades seigniorage revenues from foreigners have averaged $6‚Äì$7 billion dollars per year\\". The American $100 bill has competition from the ‚Ç¨500 note, which facilitates the transport of larger amounts of money. One million dollars in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, and is difficult to carry this much money without a briefcase and physical security. The same amount in ‚Ç¨500 notes would weigh less than three pounds, which could be dispersed in clothing and luggage without attracting attention or alerting security devices. In illegal operations, transporting currency is logistically more difficult than transporting cocaine because of its size and weight, and the ease of transporting its banknotes makes the euro attractive to Latin American drug cartels. The Swiss 1,000-franc note, worth slightly more than $1,000, is probably the only other banknote in circulation outside its home country. However, it does not have a significant advantage over the ‚Ç¨500 note to the non-Swiss; there are 20 times as many ‚Ç¨500 notes in circulation, and they are more widely recognized. As a reserve currency, it makes up about 0.1% of the currency composition of official foreign-exchange reserves. Governments vary in their issuance of large banknotes; in August 2009, the number of Fr. 1,000 notes in circulation was over three times the population of Switzerland. For comparison, the number of circulating ¬£50 banknotes is slightly less than three times the population of the United Kingdom; the Fr. 1,000 franc note is worth about ¬£600. The British government has been wary of large banknotes since the counterfeiting Operation Bernhard during World War II, which caused the Bank of England to withdraw all notes larger than ¬£5 from circulation. The bank did not reintroduce other denominations until the early 1960s (¬£10), 1970 (¬£20) and March 20, 1981 (¬£50).

Chepang Then and Now: Life and Change Among the Chepang of Nepal. Blurb Books. Over the past two or three generations, the Chepang have begun to slowly shift from a semi-nomadic (slash-and-burn) lifestyle to a more settled way of life, relying increasingly upon the production of permanent fields of maize, millet and bananas. The severe topography, however, has made permanent farming difficult (and usually insufficient), and the forest has remained an important (although decreasingly so) source of food for the Chepang. Historically, the collection of wild yams and tubers, fish caught from nearby rivers, bats and wild birds, and periodically wild deer hunted from nearby forests, have supplemented their need for carbohydrates and protein. With increasing populations, lack of arable land and few irrigation options, malnutrition has been a historic problem for the Chepang despite forest supplements. The Chepang have often been characterized as the poorest of Nepal's poor. Forced teenage pregnancies are common. Chepang men and women are basically egalitarian and no social ranking exists as it does in caste Nepalese society. Many Chepang cannot read and write due to a lack of education beyond elementary school, and this illiteracy stands in contrast to the great gains Nepal has been making in reducing illiteracy.http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2015-12-20/children-in- chitwan-deprived-of-education-past-primary-level.html According to the 2001 Nepal Census, there are 52,237 Chepang in the country, of which 67.63% were Hindu, 23.38% were Buddhists, 7.74% were Christians, and 1.25% others. They are mostly located in Dhading District, Chitwan District, Gorkha District, Makwanpur District, and Tanahu District. Religion The Chepangs themselves follow Animism, although they are strongly influenced by both Hinduism and Buddhism, which came from the Tamangs just north of them. They observe all the Hindu festivals of Dashain, Tihar and Sakrantis besides their own tribal festival Nwagi or Chhonam, which is performed on a Tuesday during third week of Bhadra (some day in August and September). Chhonam is the auspicious day for eating a new crop. Before the celebration of this festival, eating certain agricultural products is prohibited. In the 5th National Gathering of Chepang, 2004, it was stated they practiced Prakriti (Nature), with ancestor worship as most important. They worship many deities including Bhumi, Aita Bare, Gaidu, Namrung etc. (earth deity) etc. They also observe other different festivals like, Maghe Sakranti, Saune Sakranti, Dashain, Tihar.http://nnem.org/?p=336 A significantly higher percentage of the Chepang are Christian than the national average.http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-01-02/the-chepang-people- of-chitwan-and-their-conversion-to-christianity.html Language The language is also known as Chepang but is called Chyo-bang by the people themselves. These people are also called \\"Praja\\" meaning \\"political subjects\\". The people speak 3 different dialects of this Tibeto-Burman language that is closely related to Raute and Raji, two undocumented languages spoken in western Nepal. Chepang language is one of the few languages which uses a duodecimal (base 12) counting system rather than the decimal (base 10). 2015 earthquake and political crisis Chepang are among the most vulnerable due to the combination of April 2015 Nepal earthquake and 2015 Nepal blockade. More than 50 per cent of the people killed were from marginalised communities ranked low in the Human Development Index (HDI). Chepang communities were already suffering from severe malnutrition before the blockade,http://nepalitimes.com/article/nation/April-25-earthquake-Tamang- epicentre,2407 along with the Tamang. Due to historic discrimination and neglect and remote communities, Chepang have suffered discrimination even at the hands of the Nepali Food Corporation in charge of emergency food distribution.http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2015-10-11/food-crisis- grips-chepang-villages.html It is said that Chepangs compulsorily eat rice during Dashain, where meat is often eaten by more wealthy groups, but they are unlikely to afford even rice this year (2015). Hence they are among the most vulnerable ethnic groups facing potential population bottleneck in the winter of 2015/16 despite their already small numbers.

The term may also be used to refer to juveniles of other organisms. A newborn is, in colloquial use, an infant who is only hours, days, or up to one month old. In medical contexts, newborn or neonate (from Latin, neonatus, newborn) refers to an infant in the first 28 days after birth; the term applies to premature, full term, and postmature infants; before birth, the term \\"fetus\\" is used. The term \\"infant\\" is typically applied to young children under one year of age; however, definitions may vary and may include children up to two years of age. When a human child learns to walk, the term \\"toddler\\" may be used instead. In British English, an infant school is for children aged between four and seven. As a legal term, \\"infancy\\" continues from birth until age 18. Physical characteristics of newborns Eight-month-old twin sisters (video) A very young baby moves around in a crib, 2009 Eight month-old infant; as a common feature eyes are usually large in relation to the face. A crying newborn, a few days after birth A newborn's shoulders and hips are wide, the abdomen protrudes slightly, and the arms and legs are relatively long with respect to the rest of their body. =Length= In first world nations, the average total body length of a newborn is , although premature newborns may be much smaller. The way to measure a baby's length is to lay the baby down and stretch a measuring tape from the top of the head to the bottom of the heel. =Weight= In developed countries, the average birth weight of a full-term newborn is approximately , and is typically in the range of . Over the first 5‚Äì7 days following birth, the body weight of a term neonate decreases by 3‚Äì7%, and is largely a result of the resorption and urination of the fluid that initially fills the lungs, in addition to a delay of often a few days before breastfeeding becomes effective. After the first week, healthy term neonates should gain 10‚Äì20 grams/day. =Head= A newborn's head is very large in proportion to the body, and the cranium is enormous relative to his or her face. While the adult human skull is about one seventh of the total body length, the newborn's is about ¬º. Normal head circumference for a full-term infant is 33‚Äì36 cm at birth. At birth, many regions of the newborn's skull have not yet been converted to bone, leaving \\"soft spots\\" known as fontanels. The two largest are the diamond-shaped anterior fontanel, located at the top front portion of the head, and the smaller triangular-shaped posterior fontanel, which lies at the back of the head. Later in the child's life, these bones will fuse together in a natural process. A protein called noggin is responsible for the delay in an infant's skull fusion. A newborn baby in Indonesia, with umbilical cord ready to be clamped During labour and birth, the infant's skull changes shape to fit through the birth canal, sometimes causing the child to be born with a misshapen or elongated head. It will usually return to normal on its own within a few days or weeks. Special exercises sometimes advised by physicians may assist the process. =Hair= Some newborns have a fine, downy body hair called lanugo. It may be particularly noticeable on the back, shoulders, forehead, ears and face of premature infants. Lanugo disappears within a few weeks. Infants may be born with full heads of hair; others, particularly caucasian infants, may have very fine hair or may even be bald. Amongst fair-skinned parents, this fine hair may be blonde, even if the parents are not. Infants hair color and texture change. Red can give way to blond. Curly can go straight and baby's thick, dark hair could make its reappearance a lot sparser and lighter. The scalp may also be temporarily bruised or swollen, especially in hairless newborns, and the area around the eyes may be puffy. =Skin= Immediately after birth, a newborn's skin is often grayish to dusky blue in color. As soon as the newborn begins to breathe, usually within a minute or two, the skin's color reaches its normal tone. Newborns are wet, covered in streaks of blood, and coated with a white substance known as vernix caseosa, which is hypothesised to act as an antibacterial barrier. The newborn may also have Mongolian spots, various other birthmarks, or peeling skin, particularly on the wrists, hands, ankles, and feet. =Genitals= A newborn's genitals are enlarged and reddened, with male infants having an unusually large scrotum. The breasts may also be enlarged, even in male infants. This is caused by naturally occurring maternal hormones and is a temporary condition. Females (and even males) may actually discharge milk from their nipples (sometimes called witch's milk), or a bloody or milky-like substance from the vagina. In either case, this is considered normal and will disappear with time. =Umbilical cord= The umbilical cord of a newborn is bluish-white in color. After birth, the umbilical cord is normally cut, leaving a 1‚Äì2 inch stub. The umbilical stub will dry out, shrivel, darken, and spontaneously fall off within about 3 weeks. This will later become a belly-button after it heals. Occasionally, hospitals may apply triple dye to the umbilical stub to prevent infection, which may temporarily color the stub and surrounding skin purple. The umbilical cord contains three vessels: two arteries and one vein. The two arteries carry blood from the baby to the placenta while one vein carries blood back to the baby.

A crying infant may be trying to express a variety of feelings including hunger, discomfort, overstimulation, boredom, wanting something, or loneliness. Breastfeeding is the recommended method of feeding by all major infant health organizations. If breastfeeding is not possible or desired, bottle feeding is done with expressed breast-milk or with infant formula. Infants are born with a sucking reflex allowing them to extract the milk from the nipples of the breasts or the nipple of the baby bottle, as well as an instinctive behavior known as rooting with which they seek out the nipple. Sometimes a wet nurse is hired to feed the infant, although this is rare, especially in developed countries. Adequate food consumption at an early age is vital for an infant's development. The foundations of optimum health, growth, and neurodevelopment across the lifespan are established in the first 1000 days of life. From birth to four months, infants should consume breast milk or an unmodified milk substitute. As an infant's diet matures, finger foods may be introduced as well as fruit, vegetables and small amounts of meat. As infants grow, food supplements are added. Many parents choose commercial, ready-made baby foods to supplement breast milk or formula for the child, while others adapt their usual meals for the dietary needs of their child. Whole cow's milk can be used at one year, but lower-fat milk is not recommended until the child is 2 to 3 years old. Weaning is the process through which breast milk is eliminated from the infant's diet through the introduction of solid foods in exchange for milk. Until they are toilet- trained, infants in industrialized countries wear diapers. The transition from diapers to training pants is an important transition in the development of an infant/baby to that of a toddler. Children need more sleep than adults‚Äîup to 18 hours for newborn babies, with a declining rate as the child ages. Until babies learn to walk, they are carried in the arms, held in slings or baby carriers, or transported in baby carriages or strollers. Most industrialized countries have laws requiring child safety seats for babies in motor vehicles. Response to sounds Baby standing in bed - 1983 Nine-month infant playing with plastic duck toys - 1970 Infants respond to the sound of snake hissing, angry voices of adults, the crackling sound of a fire, thunder, and the cries of other infants. They have a drop in heart rate, their eyes blinking, increased turning toward the speakers or parent, all of these indicating that they were paying more attention. This is believed to be an evolutionary response to danger. Babies' ability to accurately locate sounds is refined during their first year. Benefits of touch Studies have shown that infants who have been the recipients of positive touch experience more benefits as they develop emotionally and socially. Experiments have been done with infants up to four months of age using both positive touch (stroking or cuddling) and negative touch (poking, pinching or tickling). The infants who received the positive touch cried less often and also vocalized and smiled more than the infants who were touched negatively. Infants who were the recipients of negative touching have been linked with emotional and behavioral problems later in life. A lower amount of physical violence in adults has been discovered in cultures with greater levels of positive physical touching. Diseases The infant is undergoing many adaptations to extrauterine life, and its physiological systems, such as the immune system, are far from fully developed. Potential diseases of concern during the neonatal period include: * Neonatal jaundice * Infant respiratory distress syndrome * Neonatal lupus erythematosus * Neonatal conjunctivitis * Neonatal tetanus * Neonatal sepsis * Neonatal bowel obstruction * Benign neonatal seizures * Neonatal diabetes mellitus * Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia * Neonatal herpes simplex * Neonatal hemochromatosis * Neonatal meningitis * Neonatal hepatitis * Neonatal hypoglycemia Mortality An infant being immunized in Bangladesh Infant mortality is the death of an infant in the first year of life, often expressed as the number of deaths per 1000 live births (infant mortality rate). Major causes of infant mortality include dehydration, infection, congenital malformation and SIDS. This epidemiological indicator is recognized as a very important measure of the level of health care in a country because it is directly linked with the health status of infants, children, and pregnant women as well as access to medical care, socioeconomic conditions, and public health practices. There is a positive relationship between national wealth and good health. The rich and industrialized countries of the world, prominently Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, spend a large proportion of their wealthy budget on the health care system. As, a result, their health care systems are very sophisticated, with many physicians, nurses, and other health care experts servicing the population. Thus, infant mortality is low. On the other hand, a country such as Mexico, which spends disproportionately less of its budget on healthcare, suffers from high mortality rates. This is because the general population is likely to be less healthy. In the U.S., infant mortality rates are especially high in minority groups. For instance, non-Hispanic black women have an infant mortality rate of 13.63 per 1000 live births whereas in non-Hispanic white women it was much lower at a rate of 5.76 per 1000 live births. The average infant mortality rate in the U.S. is 6.8 per 1000 live births.

This copy, Copy AA, was printed and painted in 1826, is currently held by the Fitzwilliam Museum. Attachment theory is primarily an evolutionary and ethological theory whereby the infant or child seeks proximity to a specified attachment figure in situations of alarm or distress for the purpose of survival. \\"Until recently, scientific accounts ... of the infant's early social experiences converged on the view that the infant progresses from a primary relationship with one individual... to relationships with a growing number of people... This is an epigenetic, hierarchical view of social development. We have labeled this dominant view the continuous care and contact model (CCC...). The CCC model developed from the writings of Spitz..., Bowlby..., and Provence and Lipton... on institutionalized children and is represented in the psychological views of Bowlby...[and others]. Common to the different conceptual frameworks is the belief that parenting practices and the infant's capacity for social engagement are biologically based and conform to a prototypical form. Supporters of the CCC model generally recognize that the infant and caregiver are able to adjust to a range of conditions, but they consider the adjustments observed to reflect biological variation. However, more extreme views (e.g., maternal bonding) consider certain variants as non adaptive and as compromising the child's psychological development. Bowlby's concept of monotropism is an exemplar of the CCC perspective...\\". The forming of attachments is considered to be the foundation of the infant/child's capacity to form and conduct relationships throughout life. Attachment is not the same as love or affection although they often go together. Attachment and attachment behaviors tend to develop between the age of 6 months and 3 years. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment, which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships.Bretherton, I. and Munholland, K., A. Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited. Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications 1999 eds Cassidy, J. and Shaver, P., R. Guilford press There are a number of attachment 'styles' namely 'secure', 'anxious-ambivalent', 'anxious-avoidant', (all 'organized') and 'disorganized', some of which are more problematic than others. A lack of attachment or a seriously disrupted capacity for attachment could potentially amount to serious disorders. Infants develop distinct relationships to their mothers, fathers, siblings, and non-familial caregivers.Klitzing K von, Simoni H, Amsler F, Burgin D: The role of the father in early family interactions. Inf Mental Health J 1999; 20: 222‚Äì37.

Von Lingenthal received his early education at the famous public school of St. Afra in Meissen and later studied philosophy, history, mathematics and jurisprudence at the University of Leipzig. In 1792 he went to Wittenberg University as tutor to one of the counts of Lippe, and continued his legal studies. In 1794 he became Privatdozent, lecturing on Canon law, in 1798 extraordinary professor, and 1802 ordinary professor of feudal law. From that time to his death in 1843, with the exception of a short period in which public affairs occupied him, he poured out a succession of works covering the whole field of jurisprudence, and was a copious contributor to periodicals. In 1807 he received a call to Heidelberg, then beginning its period of splendour as a school of law. There, resisting many calls to G√∂ttingen, Berlin and other universities, he remained until his death. In 1820 he took his seat, as representative of his university, in the upper house of the newly constituted parliament of Baden. Though he himself prepared many reforms - notably in the harsh criminal code - he was, by instinct and conviction, conservative and totally opposed to the violent democratic spirit which dominated the second chamber, and brought it into conflict with the grand-duke and the German federal government. After the remodelling of the constitution in a \\"reactionary\\" sense, he was returned, in 1825, by the district of Heidelberg to the second chamber, of which he became the first vice-president, and in which he proved himself more \\"loyal\\" than the government itself. With the growth of parliamentary Liberalism, however, he grew disgusted with politics, from which he retired altogether in 1829. He then devoted himself wholly to juridical work and to the last days of his life toiled with the ardour of a young student.  Works and studies  The German universities then enjoyed, in regard to legal questions of international importance, a moral jurisdiction dating from the Middle Ages, and Zachariae was often consulted as to questions arising in Germany, France and England. Elaborate \\"opinions,\\" some of them forming veritable treatises - e.g. on Sir Augustus d'Este's claim to the dukedom of Sussex, Baron de Bode's claim as an English subject to a share in the French indemnity, the dispute as to the debts due to the elector of Hesse- Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), confiscated by Napoleon, and the constitutional position of the Mecklenburg landowners - were composed by Zachariae. Large fees which he received for these opinions and the great popularity of his lectures made him rich, and he was able to buy several estates; from one of which, Lingenthal, he took his title when, in 1842, he was ennobled by the grand-duke. He died on 27 March 1843. He had married in 1811, but his wife died four years later, leaving him a son, Karl Eduard. Zachariae's writings are many and multifarious. They deal with almost every branch of jurisprudence; they are philosophical, historical and practical, and relate to Roman, Canon, German, French and English law. The first book of much consequence which he published was Die Einheit des Staats und der Kirche mit R√ºcksicht auf die Deutsche Reichsverfassung (1797), a work on the relations of church and state, with special reference to the constitution of the empire, which displayed the writer's power of analysis and his skill in making a complicated set of facts appear to be deductions from a few principles. In 1805 appeared Versuch einer allgemeinen Hermeneutik des Rechts; and in 1806 Die Wissenschaft der Gesetzgebung, an attempt to find a new theoretical basis for society in place of the opportunist politics which had led to the cataclysm of the French Revolution. This basis he seemed to discover in something resembling Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism. Zachariae's last work of importance was Vierzig B√ºcher vom Staate (1839‚Äì1842), to which his admirers point as his enduring monument. It has been compared to Montesquieu's L'Esprit des lois, The Spirit of the Laws and covers no small part of the field of Buckle's first volume of the History of Civilization. But though it contains proof of vast erudition and many original ideas as to the future of the state and of law, it lacks logical sequence, and is, consequently, full of contradictions. Its fundamental theory is that the state had its origin, not in a contract (Rousseau-Kant), but in the consciousness of a legal duty. What Machiavelli was to the Italians and Montesquieu to the French, Zachariae aspired to become to the Germans; but he lacked their patriotic inspiration, and so failed to exercise any permanent influence on the constitutional law of his country. Among other important works of Zachariae are his Staatsrecht, and his treatise on the Code Napol√©on, Handbuch des Franz√∂sischen Civilrechts (1st print Heidelberg; 1808), of which several French editions were published, and which was translated into Italian. He strongly referred in his work to the importance of Roman Codification. Zachariae edited with Karl Joseph Mittermaier the Kritische Zeitschrift f√ºr Rechtswissenschaft und Gesetzgebung des Auslandes, and the introduction which he wrote illustrates his wide reading and his constant desire for new light upon old problems. Though Zachariae's works have been superseded, they were in their day epoch-making, and they have been superseded by books which, without them, could not have been written. For an account of Zachariae and his works, see Robert von Mohl, Geschichte u. Literatur der Staatswissenschaften (1855‚Äì58), and Charles Brocher, K. S.

His work is widely recognized as foundational to the New Thought spiritual movement.Pickren, W. E. and Rutherford, A. (2010). A History of Modern Psychology in Context. John Wiley and Sons. p. 93. Biography Born in the small town of Lebanon, New Hampshire, Quimby was one of seven children and the son of a blacksmith and his wife. As was customary for his social and economic class at that time, Quimby received little formal education. He suffered from tuberculosis in his youth, a disease that then had no cure, and was prescribed calomel by his doctor. The calomel was no cure, and began to rot his teeth. Quimby began experimenting with his own ideas for a cure. He found that intense excitement (such as galloping on his horse) alleviated his pain for brief periods of time, and he became interested in the mind's ability to affect the body. He claimed to have cured himself of TB by his methods.Wills, 1994, Certain Trumpets: The Nature of Leadership. New York: Simon & Schuster Mesmerism Quimby and Lucius Burkmar In 1836 Charles Poyen came to Belfast, Maine, from France on an extended lecture tour in New England about mesmerism, also widely known as hypnotism. He was a French mesmerist who followed in the tradition of Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis of Puys√©gur. Quimby was intensely curious and attended one of Poyen's lectures in 1838. He questioned Poyen about the nature of animal magnetism and its powers. Poyen admitted that with proper training, anyone could become adept at administering hypnotism. Quimby left his job as a watchmaker and followed Poyen's tour of New England for the next two years (1838‚Äì1840), studying to become proficient himself at applying mesmerism.Fuller, 1982, Mesmerism and the American Cure of Souls. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press Around this time Quimby encountered Lucius Burkmar, an uneducated youth who was particularly susceptible to hypnosis. Finding him useful to work with, Quimby and Burkmar developed a tour of their own. Quimby demonstrated mesmeric practice with Burkmar in front of large crowds.Dresser, A.G. (1899). The Philosophy of P.P. Quimby. Boston: George H. Ellis Co. Later Quimby and Burkmar stopped touring. Quimby claimed to heal people of ailments which doctors could not cure. Quimby told his patients that disease was caused by false beliefs, and that the cure was in the explanation of this. Personal life Quimby married and had a family. One of his sons was a follower and strong defender of him, working to differentiate his work from that of Mary Baker Eddy, a patient who later founded Christian Science. His son worked from his father's writings, which were mostly not released until the 1920s, after the son's death. Inventor By trade Quimby was a watch and clockmaker.Holmes, (1944), p.358; Albanese, (1986), p.497. He also invented items and held several patents for a variety of unrelated, larger mechanical devices.His patents included: :(a) US patent no.5650X, (held jointly with Job White: White & Quimby), dated 12 September 1829, for a \\"Circular Sawing Machine\\" ::(a later patent, lodged by Job White, US patent no.16157, dated 2 December 1856, for a \\"Method of Applying Steam to and of Cutting Scarfs from Wood\\" refers to this earlier patent); :(b) US patent no.9679X, (held by P. Quimby), dated 23 May 1836, for a \\"Permutation Lock\\"; and :(c) US patent no.7197, (held by P.P. Quimby), dated 19 March 1850, for a \\"Steering Apparatus‚Ä¶ a new and useful machine for Steering Ships and Steamboats\\".According to Clark (1982, p.104), a patent was issued to Quimby on 3 June 1829 for a \\"Chain Saw for Timber\\". But no record is available for a patent on this date from the US Patent Office. :(d) Phineas P. Quimby is listed as patentee for \\"US Patent: 8,232X: Sawing timber: Chain saw for sawing timber, wood, metal, marble, etc.\\", 3 June 1834.[http://www.datamp.org/patents/search/advance.php?pn=8232X&id;=35633&set;=1, Directory of American Tool and Machinery Patents, access-date=2018. Quote: \\"Most of the patents prior to 1836 were lost in the Dec. 1836 fire. Only about 2,000 of the almost 10,000 documents were recovered. Little is known about this patent.

Followers and patients =Notable followers= Among the people who claimed to be cured by Quimby were Julius Dresser and his wife Annetta Dresser, from what sickness it is unclear.Fuller, 1982, Mesmerism and the American Cure of Souls. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. Their son, Horatio Dresser, wrote extensively on Quimby's theories. He edited and collected many of Quimby's papers in his book Health and the Inner Life: An Analytical and Historical Study of Spiritual Healing and Theories (published before 1923; reissued as 2009 paperback by Forgotten Books). He also edited and published Quimby's papers in the book, The Collected Manuscripts of P.P. Quimby (1921; reprinted in 2008 paperback as The Quimby Manuscripts by Forgotten Books). Barry Morton, a scholar of faith healing, has said that Quimby's constant practice of his mind cure method led him to make important discoveries related to curing psychosomatic illnesses. Although Quimby did not publish his findings, he trained many others in his methods. In effect, he started a \\"gnostic\\" healing tradition. Some of his methods were adopted by John Alexander Dowie, who revolutionized Christian faith healing in the 1880s.\\"John Alexander Dowie and the Invention of Modern Faith Healing, 1882-1889,\\" (2015). https://www.academia.edu/12444505/John_Alexander_Dowie_and_the_Invention_of_Modern_Faith_Healing_1882-89 Warren Felt Evans was one of the first individuals who wrote seriously on the teachings of Phineas Quimby.See Teahan (March 1979). =Notable patients= Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, was a patient of Quimby's for a short time. Later, claims were made that she was at least partially inspired by Quimby in her theology. However, both Quimby's sonDresser, Horatio W., ed. The Quimby Manuscripts. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company Publishers, 1921. - p436. According to Quimby's son, Quote: ‚ÄúThe religion which [Mrs. Eddy] teaches certainly is hers, for which I cannot be too thankful; for I should be loath to go down to my grave feeling that my father was in any way connected with ‚ÄòChristian Science.‚Äô...In [Quimby‚Äôs method of] curing the sick, religion played no part. There were no prayers, there was no asking assistance from God or any other divinity. He cured by his wisdom.‚Äù and Christian ScientistsGottschalk, Stephen. The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1973 - p130. Quote: \\"Christian Science is a religious teaching and only incidentally a healing method. Quimbyism was a healing method and only incidentally a religious teaching. If one examines the religious implications or aspects of Quimby‚Äôs thought, it is clear that in these terms it has nothing whatever in common with Christian Science.‚Äù have pointed out major differences between Quimbyism and Christian Science. Biographer Gillian GillGill, Gillian. Mary Baker Eddy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Perseus Books, 1998, p159). Quote: ‚Äú[Julius] Dresser sees the healing power [of Quimby] as a kind of clairvoyance, an ability to enter into the sick person‚Äôs mind and read his or her thoughts; Dresser makes no suggestion that this type of healing involves tapping into a divine strength, as Mrs. Eddy would later claim for her Christian Science.‚Äù and othersKarl Holl, Der Szientismus, reprinted in Gesam- melte Aufs√§tze Zur Kirchengeschichte, III (1921-1928) Quote: \\"it was [Eddy's] earnest Puritan faith in God that separated her from Quimby from the beginning.\\" Norman Beasley writes that when Eddy had a relapse from Quimby's care, she left him \\"convinced, as she told him, that if she were to find a healing it would have to be in the Bible.\\" agreed, pointing out that because of its theism, Christian Science differs considerably from the teachings of Quimby, who did not base his work in religion.

The film is the 31st Disney animated feature film, and was the fourth produced during the Disney film era known as the Disney Renaissance. It was produced and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, and is based on the Arabic folktale of the same name from the One Thousand and One Nights. The voice cast features Scott Weinger, Robin Williams, Linda Larkin, Jonathan Freeman, Frank Welker, Gilbert Gottfried and Douglas Seale. The film follows Aladdin, an Arabian street urchin, who finds a magic lamp containing a genie. He disguises himself as a wealthy prince, and tries to impress the Sultan and his daughter. Lyricist Howard Ashman first pitched the idea, and the screenplay went through three drafts before then-Disney Studios president Jeffrey Katzenberg agreed to its production. The animators based their designs on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, and computers were used for both finishing the artwork and creating some animated elements. The musical score was written by Alan Menken and features six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Sir Tim Rice, who took over after Ashman's death. Aladdin was released on November 25, 1992, to critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1992 with an earn of over $504 million in worldwide box office revenue. Upon release, it became the first animated feature to reach the half-billion-dollar mark, and was the highest-grossing animated film of all time until it was surpassed by The Lion King. Aladdin garnered two Academy Awards, as well as other accolades for its soundtrack which had the first and only number from a Disney feature to earn a Grammy Award for Song of the Year for the film's theme song sung by Regina Belle. The film's home video VHS release also set a sales record and grossed about $500million in the United States. success led to various derived works and other material inspired by the film, including two direct-to-video sequels, The Return of Jafar (1994) and Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996); an animated television series of the same name; and a Broadway adaptation. A live-action film adaptation directed by Guy Ritchie was released on May 24, 2019.  Plot  Jafar, the Royal Vizier of the fictional city of Agrabah, placed near the Jordan River, and his parrot Iago seek a lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders. They are told that only one person is worthy to enter: \\"the diamond in the rough\\", whom Jafar later identifies as Aladdin, an Agrabah street urchin. Princess Jasmine of Agrabah, upset that the law requires her to marry a prince instead of one she loves, escapes the palace and meets Aladdin and his pet monkey, Abu. The palace guards capture Aladdin on Jafar's orders. Jasmine confronts Jafar to demand Aladdin's release, but he lies and says that Aladdin has been executed. Disguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu and brings them to the cave, ordering them to retrieve the lamp. After being told to touch nothing but the lamp, Aladdin finds a magic carpet inside and obtains the lamp. Forgetting the cave's rule, Abu grabs a jewel. Aladdin, Abu, and the carpet rush to escape the cave as it collapses. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, who throws both Aladdin and Abu back into the cave, though not before Abu steals the lamp back. Trapped, Aladdin rubs the lamp and meets the Genie who lives inside it. The Genie grants Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them all from the cave without using a wish. He uses his first wish to assume the identity of a prince to woo Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude. At Iago's suggestion, Jafar plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine. Aladdin, as \\"Prince Ali Ababwa\\", arrives in Agrabah with a large host, but Jasmine becomes angry when he discusses her fate with her father the Sultan and Jafar without her. As a means of apologizing, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a ride on the magic carpet. When she deduces his true identity, he convinces her that he only dresses as a peasant to escape the stresses of royal life. After Aladdin brings Jasmine home, the palace guards capture Aladdin on Jafar's behest and throw him into the sea. The Genie appears and saves him at the cost of his second wish. Aladdin returns to the palace and exposes Jafar's evil plot. Jafar flees after spotting the lamp and thus discovering Aladdin's true identity. Fearing that he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin breaks his promise and refuses to free the Genie. Iago steals the lamp, and Jafar becomes the Genie's new master. He uses his first two wishes to become Sultan and the world's most powerful sorcerer. He then exposes Aladdin's identity and exiles him, Abu, and the carpet to a frozen wasteland. They escape and return to the palace. Jasmine tries to help Aladdin steal the lamp back, but Jafar notices and overpowers the heroes with his magic. Aladdin taunts Jafar for being less powerful than the Genie, tricking Jafar into using his last wish to become an all-powerful genie himself. Now bound to his new lamp, Jafar ends up trapped inside it, taking Iago with him. With Agrabah returned to normal, the Genie banishes Jafar's lamp and advises Aladdin use his third wish to regain his royal title so the law will allow him to stay with Jasmine. Aladdin decides instead to keep his promise and frees the Genie. Realizing Aladdin and Jasmine's love, the Sultan changes the law to allow Jasmine to marry whom she chooses. The Genie leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together.  Cast  *Scott Weinger as Aladdin, a poverty-stricken but well-meaning Agrabah thief. For his audition, Weinger sent in a homemade audition tape as Aladdin with his mother playing the Genie, and after several callbacks found out six months later that he had been cast as the title character. Aladdin's supervising animator was Glen Keane. Brad Kane provides Aladdin's singing voice. *Robin Williams as Genie, a comedic jinnƒ´ with great power that can only be exercised when his master wishes it. Clements and Musker had written the role of the Genie for Robin Williams, and, when met with resistance, created a reel of a Williams stand-up to animation of the Genie. The directors asked Eric Goldberg, Genie's supervising animator, to animate the character over one of Williams's old stand-up comedy routines to pitch the idea to the actor. The resulting test, where Williams's stand-up about schizophrenia was translated into Genie growing another head to argue with himself, made Williams \\"laugh his ass off\\" and convinced him to sign on for the role. Williams's appearance in Aladdin marks the beginning of a transition in animation to celebrity voice actors, rather than specifically trained voice actors in animated films. *Linda Larkin as Jasmine, the princess of Agrabah, who is bored of life in the royal palace. Larkin was chosen for the role of Jasmine nine months after her audition, and had to adjust, or lower, her high-pitched voice to reach the voice the filmmakers were looking for in the character. Jasmine's supervising animator was Mark Henn. Lea Salonga provides Jasmine's singing voice. *Jonathan Freeman as Jafar, the power-hungry Grand vizier of Agrabah. Freeman was the first actor cast and spent one year and nine months recording his dialogue. He later readjusted his voice after Weinger and Larkin were cast as he felt \\"Jafar had to be seen as a real threat to Aladdin and Jasmine\\", as he was originally envisioned as an irritable character, but the directors decided that a calm villain would be scarier. Jafar's supervising animator was Andreas Deja, while Jafar's beggar and snake forms are animated by Kathy Zielinski. *Frank Welker as Abu, Aladdin's kleptomaniac pet monkey with a falsetto voice. Welker also voices Jasmine's tiger Rajah and the Cave of Wonders. Duncan Marjoribanks was the supervising animator for Abu, while Rajah was animated by Aaron Blaise. *Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's sardonic, hot-tempered parrot assistant. Will Finn was the supervising animator for Iago. *Douglas Seale as the Sultan, the dim-witted but friendly ruler of Agrabah, who desperately tries to find a suitor for his daughter Jasmine. The Sultan's supervising animator was David Pruiksma. *Jim Cummings as Razoul, the Captain of the Guards. He and the other guards were animated by Phil Young and Chris Wahl. *Charlie Adler as Gazeem, a thief that Jafar sends into the Cave of Wonders at the beginning of the film but is trapped inside for being unworthy. Gazeem was animated by T. Daniel Hofstedt. *Corey Burton as Prince Achmed, an arrogant prince whom Princess Jasmine rejects as a suitor.  Production  = Script and development = In 1988, lyricist Howard Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of Aladdin. Ashman had written a 40-page film treatment remaining faithful to the plot and characters of the original story, but envisioned as a campy 1930s-style musical with a Cab Calloway/Fats Waller-like Genie. Along with partner Alan Menken, Ashman conceived several songs and added Aladdin's friends named Babkak, Omar, and Kasim to the story. However, the studio was dismissive of Ashman's treatment and removed the project from development. Ashman and Menken were later recruited to compose songs for Beauty and the Beast. Linda Woolverton, who had also worked on Beauty and the Beast, used their treatment and developed a draft with inspired elements from The Thief of Bagdad such as a villain named Jaf'far, an aged sidekick retired human thief named Abu, and a human handmaiden for the princess. Then, directors Ron Clements and John Musker joined the production, picking Aladdin out of three projects offered, which also included an adaptation of Swan Lake and King of the Jungle‚Äîthat eventually became The Lion King. Before Ashman's death in March 1991, Ashman and Menken had composed \\"Prince Ali\\" and his last song, \\"Humiliate the Boy\\". Musker and Clements wrote a draft of the screenplay, and then delivered a story reel to studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg in April 1991. Katzenberg thought the script \\"didn't engage\\", and on a day known by the staff as \\"Black Friday,\\" demanded that the entire story be rewritten without rescheduling the film's November 25, 1992 release date. Among the changes Katzenberg requested from Clements and Musker were to not be dependent on Ashman's vision, and the removal of Aladdin's mother, remarking, \\"Eighty-six the mother. The mom's a zero.\\" Katzenberg also influenced in changing the plot element about Jasmine's marriage, which originally had her required by law to be married by sixteen, to remove the age‚Äîthe Sultan only says \\"your next birthday\\"‚Äîand make it more specific that her suitor needed to be a prince, which would also set up the ending where the Sultan, inspired by Aladdin's altruism, changes the law to make Jasmine able to marry anyone she deems worthy. Screenwriting duo Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were brought in to rework the story, and the changes they made included the removal of Aladdin's mother, the strengthening of the character of Princess Jasmine, and the deletion of several of the Ashman-Menken songs. Aladdin's personality was rewritten to be \\"a little rougher, like a young Harrison Ford,\\" and the parrot Iago, originally conceived as an uptight British archetype, was reworked into a comic role after the filmmakers saw Gilbert Gottfried in Beverly Hills Cop II, who was then cast for the role. By October 1991, Katzenberg was satisfied with the new version of Aladdin. As with Woolverton's screenplay, several characters and plot elements were based on the 1940 version of The Thief of Bagdad, though the location of the film was changed from Baghdad to the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah. = Design and animation = alt=A style guide, depicting above the characters, and below the geometrical shapes they follow. Notes on design, such as \\"High hip\\" for Jasmine and \\"Broad shoulders\\" for Jafar are scattered through the page. Atop the page is written \\"0514 ‚Äì Aladdin Style\\" The design for most characters was based on the work of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, which production designer Richard Vander Wende also considered appropriate to the theme, due to similarities to the flowing and swooping lines found in Arabic calligraphy. Jafar's design was not based on Hirschfeld's work because Jafar's supervising animator, Andreas Deja, wanted the character to be contrasting. Each character was animated alone, with the animators consulting each other to make scenes with interrelating characters. Since Aladdin's animator Glen Keane was working in the California branch of Walt Disney Feature Animation, and Jasmine's animator Mark Henn was in the Florida one at Disney-MGM Studios, they had to frequently phone, fax or send designs and discs to each other. The animators filmed monkeys at the San Francisco Zoo to study their movements for Abu's character. Iago's supervising animator Will Finn tried to incorporate some aspects of Gottfried's appearance into Iago's design, especially his semi-closed eyes and the always-appearing teeth. Some aspects of the Sultan were inspired by the Wizard of Oz, to create a bumbling authority figure. Andreas Deja, Jafar's supervising animator, tried to incorporate Jonathan Freeman's facial expressions and gesturing into the character. Animator Randy Cartwright described working on the Magic Carpet as challenging, since it is only a rectangular shape, that expresses itself through pantomime‚Äî\\"It's sort of like acting by origami\\". Cartwright kept folding a piece of cloth while animating to see how to position the Carpet. After the character animation was done, the carpet's surface design was applied digitally. Designed by a team led by supervising animator Glen Keane, Aladdin was initially going to be as young as thirteen, and was originally made to resemble actor Michael J. Fox. During production, it was decided that the design was too boyish and wasn't \\"appealing enough,\\" so the character was made eighteen and redesigned to add elements derived from actor Tom Cruise and Calvin Klein models. For the scenery design, various architectural elements seen in 19th-century orientalist paintings and photographs of the Arab world were used for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and '50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring was done with the computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality‚Äîthe protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave. Musker and Clements created the Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though Katzenberg suggested actors such as John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy, Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role. Williams came for voice recording sessions during breaks in the shooting of two other films he was starring in at the time, Hook and Toys. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams's dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams's recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match. The producers added many in-jokes and references to Disney's previous works in the film, such as a \\"cameo appearance\\" from directors Clements and Musker and drawing some characters based on Disney workers.Ron Clements, John Musker, Amy Pell.Aladdin audio commentary ‚Äì The Filmmaker's Beast, Sebastian from The Little Mermaid, and Pinocchio make brief appearances, and the wardrobe of the Genie at the end of the film‚ÄîGoofy hat, Hawaiian shirt, and sandals‚Äîare a reference to a short film that Robin Williams did for the Disney-MGM Studios tour in the late 1980s. = Robin Williams's conflicts with the studio = Initially, Robin Williams voiced Genie under the condition that his voice not be used for excessive marketing or merchandising. In gratitude for his success with Touchstone Pictures' Good Morning, Vietnam, Robin Williams voiced the Genie for SAG scale pay‚Äî$75,000‚Äîinstead of his asking fee of $8 million, on condition that his name or image not be used for marketing, and his (supporting) character not take more than 25% of space on advertising artwork, since Williams's film Toys was scheduled for release one month after Aladdins debut. For financial reasons, the studio went back on the deal on both counts, especially in poster art by having the Genie in 25% of the image, but having other major and supporting characters portrayed considerably smaller. The Disney Hyperion book Aladdin: The Making of an Animated Film listed both of Williams's characters \\"The Peddler\\" and \\"The Genie\\" ahead of main characters, but was forced to refer to him only as \\"the actor signed to play the Genie\\". Disney, while not using Williams's name in commercials as per the contract, used his voice for the Genie in the commercials and used the Genie character to sell toys and fast food tie-ins, without having to pay Williams additional money; Williams unhappily quipped at the time, \\"The only reason Mickey Mouse has three fingers is because he can't pick up a check.\\" Williams explained to New York magazine that his previous Mork & Mindy merchandising was different because, \\"the image is theirs. But the voice, that's me; I gave them myself. When it happened, I said, 'You know I don't do that.' And they [Disney] apologized; they said it was done by other people.\\" Disney attempted to assuage Williams by sending him a Pablo Picasso painting worth more than $1 million at the time, but this move failed to repair the damaged relationship, as the painting was a self-portrait of the artist as Vincent van Gogh which apparently really \\"clashed\\" with the Williams's wilder home decor. Williams refused to sign on for The Return of Jafar so it was Dan Castellaneta that voiced the Genie. When Jeffrey Katzenberg was replaced by Joe Roth as Walt Disney Studios chairman, Roth organized a public apology to Williams. Williams would, in turn, reprise the role in the 1996 direct-to-video sequel Aladdin and the King of Thieves. = Music = The third‚Äîafter The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast‚Äîand final Disney film score the duo would work on, Alan Menken and Howard Ashman began writing the Academy Award-winning score together, with Tim Rice taking over as lyricist after Ashman died of AIDS-related complications part way through the production of Aladdin in early 1991. Although fourteen songs were written for Aladdin, only seven are featured in the movie, three by Ashman, and four by Rice. Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is \\"consistently good, rivaling the best of Disney's other animated musicals from the '90s.\\" The DVD Special Edition released in 2004 includes four songs in early animation tests, and a music video of one, \\"Proud of Your Boy\\", performed by Clay Aiken, which also appears on the album Disneymania 3. The version of the song \\"A Whole New World\\" performed by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle, which plays over the end credits, is, , the only Disney song to win a Grammy Award for Song of the Year.  Themes  The filmmakers thought the moral message of the original tale was inappropriate, and decided to \\"put a spin on it\\" by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great solution, but eventually becoming a problem. Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be what the person is not‚Äîboth Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble pretending to be different people, and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine, who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is. Being \\"imprisoned\\" is also presented, a fate that occurs to most of the characters‚ÄîAladdin and Jasmine are limited by their lifestyles, Genie is attached to his lamp, and Jafar to the Sultan‚Äîand is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace, and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees. Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess, being rebellious against the royal life and the social structure.  Release  = Box office = A large promotion campaign preceded Aladdins debut in theaters, with the film's trailer being attached to most Disney VHS releases (including 101 Dalmatians in April 1992 and Beauty and the Beast in October), and numerous tie-ins and licensees being released. After a limited release on November 13, 1992, Aladdin debuted in 1,131 theaters on November 25, 1992, grossing $19.2 million in its opening weekend‚Äînumber two at the box office, behind Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. It took eight weeks for the film to reach number one at the US box office, breaking the record for the week between Christmas and New Year's Eve with $32.2 million. The film held the top spot five times during its 22-week run. Aladdin was the most successful film of 1992 grossing $217 million in the United States and over $504 million worldwide. It was the biggest gross for an animated film until The Lion King two years later, and was the first full-length animated film to gross $200 million in North America. Outside of North America, the film grossed $200 million in 1993, and $250 million by January 1994. By 2002, the film had grossed $287 million overseas and $504 million worldwide. Currently, it is the 35th-highest-grossing animated film and the third-highest-grossing traditionally animated feature worldwide, behind The Lion King and The Simpsons Movie. It sold an estimated 52,442,300 tickets in the United States, where its domestic gross is equivalent to $477,749,800 adjusted for inflation in 2018. = Home media = The film was first released in VHS on October 1, 1993, as part of the Walt Disney Classics line. In its first week of availability, Aladdin sold over 10.6 million copies, grossing about $265million in the United States. In less than three weeks, the VHS release of Aladdin sold over 16million units and grossed over $400million in the United States. By December 1993, it had topped 21million sales and grossed about $500million in the United States. By 1994, it went on to sell over 25 million units in total (a record only broken by the later release of The Lion King). This VHS edition entered moratorium on April 30, 1994. A THX-certified widescreen LaserDisc was issued on September 21, 1994, and a Spanish-dubbed VHS for the American market was released on April 14, 1995. In Japan, 2.2million home video units were sold by 1995. On October 5, 2004, Aladdin was rereleased onto VHS and for the first time released onto DVD, as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line. The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned-up animation, prepared for Aladdins planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003, and a second disc with bonus features. Accompanied by a $19 million marketing campaign, the DVD sold about 3 million units in its first month. The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008, along with its sequels. According to an insert in the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition release case, Aladdin was going to be released on Blu-ray Disc as a Diamond Edition in Spring 2013. Instead, Peter Pan was released on Blu-ray as a Diamond Edition on February 5, 2013 to celebrate its 60th anniversary. A non-Diamond Edition Blu-ray was released in a few select European countries in March 2013. The Belgian edition (released without advertisements, commercials or any kind of fanfare) comes as a single- disc version with its extras ported over from the Platinum Edition DVD. The same disc was released in the United Kingdom on April 14, 2013. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on a Diamond Edition Blu-ray on October 13, 2015. The film was released on Digital HD on September 29, 2015. Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Blu-ray Disc sales chart and debuted at number 2 at the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales behind the disaster film San Andreas. The film's Blu-ray release in the United States sold 1.81million units and grossed $39 million, . Aladdin was re-released on HD and 4K digital download on August 27, 2019, with a physical media re-release on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray on September 10, 2019, as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection.  Reception  = Critical reception = The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 95% of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 74 reviews, with an average rating of 8.15/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"A highly entertaining entry in Disney's renaissance era, Aladdin is beautifully drawn, with near-classic songs and a cast of scene-stealing characters.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \\"A+\\" grade. Most critics' praise went to Robin Williams's performance as Genie, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children \\"needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is\\", and Roger Ebert commenting that Williams and animation \\"were born for one another\\". Warner Bros. Cartoons director Chuck Jones even called the film \\"the funniest feature ever made.\\" Furthermore, English-Irish comedian Spike Milligan considered it to be the greatest film of all time. James Berardinelli gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the \\"crisp visuals and wonderful song-and-dance numbers.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the comedy made the film accessible to both children and adults, a vision shared with Desson Howe of The Washington Post, who also said \\"kids are still going to be entranced by the magic and adventure.\\" Brian Lowry of Variety praised the cast of characters, describing the expressive magic carpet as \\"its most remarkable accomplishment\\" and considered that \\"Aladdin overcomes most story flaws thanks to sheer technical virtuosity.\\" Some aspects of the film were widely criticized. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wrote a negative review, describing the film as racist, ridiculous, and a \\"narcissistic circus act\\" from Robin Williams. Roger Ebert, who generally praised the film in his review, considered the music inferior to its predecessors The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, and claimed Aladdin and Jasmine were \\"pale and routine.\\" He criticized what he saw as the film's use of ethnic stereotypes, writing: \\"Most of the Arab characters have exaggerated facial characteristics‚Äîhooked noses, glowering brows, thick lips‚Äîbut Aladdin and the princess look like white American teenagers.\\" = Accolades = Aladdin also received many award nominations, mostly for its music. It won two Academy Awards, Best Original Score and Best Original Song for \\"A Whole New World\\" and receiving nominations for Best Song (\\"Friend Like Me\\"), Best Sound Editing (Mark A. Mangini), and Best Sound (Terry Porter, Mel Metcalfe, David J. Hudson and Doc Kane). At the Golden Globes, Aladdin won Best Original Song (\\"A Whole New World\\") and Best Original Score, as well as a Special Achievement Award for Robin Williams, with a nomination for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy. Other awards included the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature, a MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance to Robin Williams, Saturn Awards for Best Fantasy Film, Performance by a Younger Actor to Scott Weinger and Supporting Actor to Robin Williams, the Best Animated Feature by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and four Grammy Awards, Best Soundtrack Album, and Song of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television for \\"A Whole New World\\". The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: 2004: AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs: * \\"Friend Like Me\\" ‚Äì Nominated * \\"A Whole New World\\" ‚Äì Nominated = Controversies = One of the verses of the opening song \\"Arabian Nights\\" was altered following complaints from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC). The lyrics were changed in July 1993 from \\"Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face\\" in the original release to \\"Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense,\\" with the change first appearing on the 1993 video release. The original lyric was intact on the initial CD soundtrack release, but the re-releases use the edited lyric. The Broadway adaptation also uses the edited line. The rerecording has the original voice on all other lines and then a noticeably deeper voice says the edited line. The subsequent line however, \\"It's barbaric, but hey, it's home,\\" was left intact. Entertainment Weekly ranked Aladdin in a list of the most controversial films in history, due to this incident. The number has been described in reviews as \\"simultaneously glamorizing and barbarizing the Arab world.\\" The ADC also complained about the portrayal of the lead characters Aladdin and Jasmine. They criticized the characters' anglicized features and Anglo-American accents, in contrast to the other characters in the film, which have foreign accents, grotesque facial features, and appear villainous or greedy. Concerns were also raised to another scene. When Aladdin is threatened by the tiger Rajah on the palace balcony, Aladdin quietly says a line that some people reported hearing as \\"Good teenagers, take off your clothes,\\" which they considered a subliminal reference to promiscuity. However, according to the commentary track on the 2004 DVD, while Musker and Clements did admit Scott Weinger ad-libbed during the scene, they claimed \\"we did not record that, we would not record that,\\" and said the line was \\"Good tiger, take off and go...\\" and the word \\"tiger\\" is overlapped by Rajah's snarl.Ron Clements and John Musker, \\"Filmmaker's Commentary\\". Aladdin: Platinum Edition DVD, Disc 1, Bonus Features, Backstage Disney, Walt Disney Home Entertainment. After the word tiger, a second voice can be heard which has been suggested was accidentally grafted onto the soundtrack. Because of the controversy, Disney removed the line on the DVD release.. The source compiles and cites four major newspaper references. Animation enthusiasts have noticed similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams's unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler (also known as The Princess and the Cobbler under Allied Filmmakers and Arabian Knight under Miramax Films). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes and background designs, and the antagonist Zig-Zag's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar. Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler initially began production much earlier in the 1960s, and was mired in difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work. The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the Cobbler being labeled a rip-off of Aladdin.  Live-action adaptations  = Live-action prequel spin-off = On July 15, 2015, the studio announced the development of a live-action comedy adventure prequel called Genies. The film was being written by Mark Swift and Damian Shannon, while Tripp Vinson was on board to produce via his Vinson Films banner. It was intended to serve as a lead to the live-action Aladdin film. On November 8, Disney revealed it had originally planned to use Robin Williams's unused lines from the 1991‚Äì92 recording sessions for the film, but his will prohibited the studio from using his likeness for 25 years after his 2014 death. = Live-action film = In October 2016, it was reported that Disney was developing a live-action adaptation of Aladdin with Guy Ritchie signed on to direct the film. John August is writing the script, which will reportedly retain the musical elements of the original film, while Dan Lin is attached as producer. Lin revealed that they were looking for a diverse cast. In April 2017, Will Smith entered talks to play the Genie. The following month, Jade Thirlwall entered talks to portray the role of Jasmine. Alan Menken said filming was slated to begin August 2017. Production had originally been scheduled to begin in July, but was delayed due to Disney having trouble finding the right people to play Aladdin and Jasmine. British actress Naomi Scott and Indian actress Tara Sutaria were being considered to play Jasmine. For the role of Aladdin, British actors Riz Ahmed and Dev Patel were initially considered, but it was later decided that a newcomer should be cast in the role. In July 2017, it was announced that Egyptian-Canadian actor Mena Massoud had been cast as Aladdin, Scott as Jasmine, and Smith as the Genie. At the 2017 D23 Expo, Menken announced that he would be co-writing new songs for the film with Academy Award winners Pasek and Paul while Vanessa Taylor would re- write the script. In August 2017, Marwan Kenzari, Nasim Pedrad, and Numan Acar joined the cast as Jafar, Dalia, and Hakim, respectively. The following month, Billy Magnussen and Navid Negahban were cast as Prince Anders and the Sultan, respectively. Filming began on September 6, 2017 at Longcross Studios and concluded on January 24, 2018. The film was released on May 24, 2019.
