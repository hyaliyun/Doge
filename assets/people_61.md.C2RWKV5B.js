Unlike most Ethical Hacking organizations, Project Insecurity takes the non- conventional approach of hiring former cyber-criminals in attempt to give them a chance at exhibiting reformed behavior. The Founder and CEO (Matthew Telfer) is also a former cyber-criminal himself. Some other notable members who have a history of malicious criminal activity include Dominik Penner from NullCrew and Kane Gamble from Crackas With Attitude, a group responsible for hacking the CIA, US Department of Justice, and the FBI. Matthew Telfer's stance on this is that those who have hacked maliciously have a deeper understanding of such concepts, and that their talent should not be put to waste. Project Insecurity have released a number of noteworthy security flaws since their formation in 2017. These flaws were disclosed to the affected software vendors in a responsible manner, and some examples of large sites that were vulnerable include Google, Twitter, PayPal, Bank of America, Kaspersky, AT&T;, Tesla, Verizon Media, and Sony, among many other websites. Project Insecurity are known by their company slogans, \\"Security is an illusion\\", and \\"We're in security to prevent insecurity  Formation  Project Insecurity first entered the public sphere in 2017 and shortly after, they became a registered Limited Company within the United Kingdom. During 2017 and 2018, Project Insecurity released a large number of Computer Exploits and Educational Tools and Resources  Timeline of Released Work  In a two-year period from 2017 until 2019, Project Insecurity released a large number of Private Exploits. When the organization originally surfaced, an assortment of security exploits were publicly disclosed; primarily exposing flaws in Content Management Systems and Forum Board Software. Some examples of these include XenForo, MyBB, phpBB, X-Cart, OsCommerce, concrete5, and Invision Power Board. Project Insecurity also released the exploit code for Hangzhou XiaongMai Technologies CCTV Cameras, demonstrating how it was possible for hackers to take control of over two million vulnerable devices and use them as part of a Botnet. These devices were believed to have been used to partially power the Mirai Botnet, resulting in what was (at the time) the most powerful Denial of Service attack in the history of the internet. In late 2017, Corben Leo of Project Insecurity published several exploits affecting the Pulse Connect Secure VPN client developed by Juniper Networks, this client is primarily used within intranet environments, but many sites used this and were affected, notably Twitter. Around this same time period, Project Insecurity released several exploits affecting popular plugins for WordPress and Joomla. In April 2018, Project Insecurity released two exploits affecting live chat systems used by various Internet Service Providers and Financial corporations around the world. Nuance Communications and LiveChat were the affected software vendors, both of which appeared to be vulnerable to bugs of a similar nature. These bugs allowed a malicious hacker to glean information on employees relating to the affected companies, such as the name, email, and employee ID of the chat agent, alongside other information such as the backend systems in use, allowing a malicious hacker to potentially gain a foothold within these networks. Some of the affected companies included Google, PayPal, Bank of America, Verizon, Sony, Tesla, Orange, Kaspersky, BitDefender, AT&T;, and many other large corporations . One of the founders of this exploit was Kane Gamble, who was convicted and given a two-year prison sentence shortly after these exploits were disclosed. Kane's sentencing was unrelated to any activities involving Project Insecurity and was instead due to his involvement with Crackas With Attitude, a group responsible for purportedly hacking the CIA, FBI and Department of Homeland Security. Prior to his sentencing, Kane Gamble had been attempting to show that he had reformed his character, not only working alongside Project Insecurity to help secure the above affected systems, but also by reporting vulnerabilities to companies such as T-Mobile USA of his own accord. In May 2018, Project Insecurity member Six gained access to an administrative portal for EE, the largest telecommunications provider in the UK. This allowed him to view more than two million lines of their source code, including private developer API keys and Amazon Web Services secret keys. In August 2018, Project Insecurity released a series of critical exploits for OpenEMR, the most popular Electronic Medical Record system in existence. There was over 25 vulnerabilities released in total, some of which would allow a malicious hacker to obtain full access to any machine running OpenEMR. This meant that such a flaw could be leveraged to expose the personal information of more than 100 million people worldwide, including 30-million US Citizens. This information was very sensitive in nature, and it included details about particular medical conditions that people are suffering from, alongside personally identifiable information such as their names, addresses, photographs, social security numbers, and more.https://www.open- emr.org/wiki/images/1/11/Openemr_insecurity.pdf Also released in August 2018, Project Insecurity published an \\"APT-Ready\\" flaw affecting almost every Internet service provider in Canada, along with many in the United States. Project Insecurity pointed out that such a flaw could have been used by a rogue government to possibly manipulate the 2019 Canadian General Elections, and stated that the vulnerability could have potentially revealed the personal details of almost 80% of Canada's entire population. This issue was made possible through a flaw in SOLEO IP-RELAY. Some of the affected sites included Bell Canada, SaskTel, Rogers Communications, Telus, Shaw Communications, EastLink, and a number of other websites.

The Stockton Ship Channel is long and about deep, allowing up to Panama Canal size ocean ships access to the Port of Stockton at the City of Stockton. The Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel is part of the vast Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta that has a connection to the Pacific Ocean. Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel is also called the lower San Joaquin River.usace.army.mil, Baldwin-Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel History At the time of the 1849 California Gold Rush ocean steamboats could travel up the San Joaquin River to Fresno. As San Joaquin Valley grew agriculturally and river water was used for crops, the river became shallow. With slower moving water, silt began to build up in the river and it became even shallower. By 1890 the city of Stockton had lost its importance as a seaport. By 1910 the city had created proposals to increase the depth of the lower river by dredging; however, the plans were delayed by World War I. In 1925 the city began a $1.3 million bond campaign dedicated to dredging the lower San Joaquin. Rose, p. 27 Stockton partnered with the federal and state governments in 1926 to form a $8.2 million fund to change the river to a new channel. In 1928 the river-channel project began. The river was both widened and deepened. To straighten the river, meanders and oxbow lakes were removed.Rose, p. 110 Major straightening cuts were built at Hog Island, Venice Island and Mandeville Island, along with five minor straightening cuts. The new deepwater channel was now long and had a depth of . As silt build-up still continues, major dredging was performed in both 1968 and 1982.Rose, p. 111 The Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel can handle fully loaded ocean vessels of up to and up to long. Environmental concern The slowing of the river-channel has unexpectedly caused low dissolved oxygen levels in the lower San Joaquin River water. The low dissolved oxygen has hurt the fish populations. The three causes are the straightening of the river, pollution from the harbors and cities, and poor tidal mixing.

Mummers' plays are folk plays performed by troupes of amateur actors, traditionally all male, known as mummers or guisers (also by local names such as rhymers, pace-eggers, soulers, tipteerers, wrenboys, and galoshins). It refers particularly to a play in which a number of characters are called on stage, two of whom engage in a combat, the loser being revived by a doctor character. This play is sometimes found associated with a sword dance though both also exist in Britain independently. Mumming spread from the British Isles to a number of former British colonies. It is sometimes performed in the street but more usually during visits to houses and pubs. It is generally performed seasonally or annually, often at Christmas, Easter or on Plough Monday, more rarely on Halloween or All Souls' Day, and often with a collection of money, in which the practice may be compared with other customs such as those of Halloween, Bonfire Night, wassailing, pace egging and first- footing at new year.Peter Thomas Millington, The Origins and Development of English Folk Plays, National Centre for English Cultural Tradition, University of Sheffield, 2002, pp. 22, 139 Although the term mummers has been in use since the Middle Ages, no scripts or details survive from that era and the term may have been used loosely to describe performers of several different kinds. The earliest evidence of mummers' plays as they are known today is from the mid- to late 18th century. Mummers' plays should not be confused with the earlier mystery plays. Etymology The word mummer is sometimes explained to derive from Middle English mum (\\"silent\\") or Greek mommo (\\"mask\\"), but is more likely to be associated with Early New High German mummer (\\"disguised person\\", attested in Johann Fischart) and vermummen (\\"to wrap up, to disguise, to mask one's face\\"),Br√ºder Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch, s.v. Mummen which itself is derived from or came to be associated with mummen (first attested already in Middle High German by a prohibition in M√ºhlhausen, Thuringia, 1351)Matthias Lexer, Mittelhochdeutsches W√∂rterbuch, s.v. mummen and mum(en)schanz, (Hans Sachs, Nuremberg, 16th century), these latter words originally referring to a game or throw (schanz) of dice.Br√ºder Grimm, Deutsches W√∂rterbuch, s.v. Mummenschanz Ingrid Brainard argues that the English word \\"mummer\\" is ultimately derived from the Greek name Momus, a god of mockery and scoff. Overview Mummers performing in Exeter, Devon in 1994 Mummers' and guisers' plays were formerly performed throughout much of English-speaking Great Britain and Ireland, spreading to other English-speaking parts of the world including Newfoundland and Saint Kitts and Nevis. There are a few surviving traditional teams of mummers in England and Ireland, but there have been many revivals of mumming, often associated nowadays with morris and sword dance groups. These performances are comparable in some respects with others throughout Europe. On 4 November 2017, following a similar announcement from the Lewes Bonfire Council, the Association of Mummers in England and Wales (AMEW) announced that Mummers would immediately cease the practice of \\"black- facing\\" or \\"blacking-up\\". Broadly comic performances, the most common type features a doctor who has a magic potion able to resuscitate the vanquished character. Early scholars of folk drama, influenced by James Frazer's The Golden Bough, tended to view these plays as descendants of pre-Christian fertility ritual, but modern researchers have subjected this interpretation to criticism. The Doctor brings St George back to life in a 2015 production by the St Albans Mummers. The characters may be introduced in a series of short speeches (usually in rhyming couplets) or they may introduce themselves in the course of the play's action. The principal characters, presented in a wide variety of manners, are a hero, most commonly Saint George, King George, or Prince George (but Robin Hood in the Cotswolds and Galoshin in Scotland), and his chief opponent (known as the Turkish Knight in southern England, but named Slasher elsewhere), and a quack Doctor who comes to restore the dead man to life. Other characters include: Old Father Christmas, who introduces some plays, the Fool and Beelzebub or Little Devil Doubt (who demands money from the audience). In Ynysmeudwy near Swansea groups of four boys dressed as Crwmpyn (hunchback) John, Indian Dark, Robin Hood and Doctor Brown took the play from house to house on Bonfire Night and were rewarded with money.Bryan Harris, article and collected text Despite the frequent presence of Saint George, the Dragon rarely appears although it is often mentioned. A dragon seems to have appeared in the Revesby Ploughboys' Play in 1779, along with a \\"wild worm\\" (possibly mechanical), but it had no words. In the few instances where the dragon appears and speaks its words can be traced back to a Cornish script published by William Sandys in 1833. Weston Mummers perform at the Packhorse Inn, Southstoke on Boxing Day, 2007. Mumming groups often wear face- obscuring hats or other kinds of headgear and masks, some mummers' faces are blackened or painted. In 1418 a law was passed forbidding \\"mumming, plays, interludes or any other disguisings with any feigned beards, painted visors, deformed or coloured visages in any wise, upon pain of imprisonment\\". Many mummers and guisers, however, have no facial disguise at all. Mumming was a way of raising money and the play was taken round the big houses. Most Southern English versions end with the entrance of \\"Little Johnny Jack his wife and family on his back\\". Johnny, traditionally played by the youngest mummer in the group, first asks for food and then more urgently for money. Johnny Jack's wife and family were either dolls in a model house or sometimes a picture.

These \\"revels\\" and \\"guisings\\" may have been an early form of masque and the early use of the term \\"mumming\\" appears to refer specifically to a performance of dicing with the host for costly jewels, after which the mummers would join the guests for dancing, an event recorded in 1377 when 130 men on horseback went \\"mumming\\" to the Prince of Wales, later Richard II.Chambers, E. K. The Elizabethan Stage. Vol. 1. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1951, pp. 150-1, quoted in History of the Masque GenreJohn Cutting, History and the Morris Dance (2005), page 81 According to German and Austrian sources dating from the 16th century, during carnival persons wearing masks used to make house-to-house visits offering a mum(en)schanz, a game of dice. This custom was practised by commoners as well as nobility. On Shrove Tuesday of 1557 Albert V, Duke of Bavaria went to visit the archbishop of Salzburg and played a game of dice with him. A similar incident, involving an Englishman, is attested for the French court by the German count and chronicler Froben Christoph von Zimmern: during carnival 1540, while the French king Francis I was residing at Angers, an Englishman (ain Engellender) wearing a mask and accompanied by other masked persons paid a visit to the king and offered him a momschanz (a game of dice).Zimmerische Chronik, vol. 3, p.264-265 While mum(en)schanz was played not only by masked persons, and not only during carnival, the German word mummenschanz nevertheless took on the meaning \\"costume, masquerade\\" and, by the 18th century, had lost its association with gambling and dice. Other than this association there is no clear evidence linking these late medieval and early modern customs with English mumming. Textual evidence An 1852 depiction of an English mummers play Although there are earlier hints (such as a fragmentary speech by St George from Exeter, Devon, which may date from 1737, although published in 1770), the earliest complete text of the \\"Doctor\\" play appears to be an undated chapbook of Alexander and the King of Egypt, published by John White (d. 1769) in Newcastle upon Tyne between 1746 and 1769. The fullest early version of a mummers' play text is probably the 1779 \\"Morrice Dancers'\\" play from Revesby, Lincolnshire. The full text (\\"A petygree of the Plouboys or modes dancers songs\\") is available online.The \\"Plouboys or modes dancers\\" at Revesby 1779Morrice Dancers at Revesby ‚Äî 1779 Although performed at Christmas, this text is a forerunner of the East Midlands Plough Monday (see below) plays. A text from Islip, Oxfordshire, dates back to 1780.The Islip Mummers' Play of 1780 A play text which had, until recently, been attributed to Mylor in Cornwall (much quoted in early studies of folk plays, such as The Mummers Play by R. J. E. Tiddy ‚Äì published posthumously in 1923 ‚Äì and The English Folk-Play (1933) by E. K. Chambers) has now been shown, by genealogical and other research, to have originated in Truro, Cornwall, around 1780.The Truro cordwainers' play: a \\"new\\" eighteenth-century Christmas play ‚Äî Research article at BNET.com A play from an unknown locality in Cheshire, close to the border with Wales, dates from before 1788.Cheshire Play ‚Äî Before 1788 Chapbook versions of The Christmas Rhime or The Mummer's Own Book were published in Belfast, c.1803-1818.Belfast Christmas Rhyme ‚Äî Smyth & Lyons (1803‚Äì1818) A mummers' play from Ballybrennan, County Wexford, Ireland, dating from around 1817‚Äì18, was published in 1863.Ballybrennan, Wexford play ‚Äî about 1823 It is from the 19th century that the bulk of recorded texts derive. Mumming, at any rate in the South of England, had its heyday at the end of the 19th century and the earliest years of the 20th century. Most traditional mummers groups (known as \\"sides\\") stopped with the onset of the First World War, but not before they had come to the attention of folklorists. In the second half of the 20th century many groups were revived, mostly by folk music and dance enthusiasts. The revived plays are frequently taken around inns and public houses around Christmas time and the begging done for some charity rather than for the mummers themselves. Local seasonal variants Antrobus Soul Cakers, in the mid-1970s, gathered round Dick, their Wild Horse Although the main season for mumming throughout Britain was around Christmas, some parts of England had plays performed around All Souls' Day (known as Souling or soul-caking) or Easter (Pace-egging or Peace-egging). In north- eastern England the plays are traditionally associated with Sword dances or Rapper dances. In some parts of Britain and Ireland the plays are traditionally performed on or near Plough Monday. These are therefore known as Plough plays and the performers as Plough-jags, Plough-jacks, Plough-bullocks, Plough-stots or Plough witches. The Plough plays of the East Midlands of England (principally Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire) feature several different stock characters (including a Recruiting Sergeant, Tom Fool, Dame Jane and the \\"Lady bright and gay\\"). Tradition has it that ploughboys would take their plays from house to house and perform in exchange for money or gifts, some teams pulling a plough and threatened to plough up people's front gardens or path if they did not pay up. Examples of the play have been found in Denmark since the late 1940s. =England= Around Sheffield and in nearby parts of northern Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire a dramatised version of the well-known Derby Ram folksong, known as the Derby Tup (another word for ram), has been performed, since at least 1895, by teams of boys. The brief play is usually introduced by two characters, an old man and an old woman (\\"Me and our owd lass\\"). The Tup was usually represented by a boy, bent over forwards, covered with a sack, and carrying a broomstick with a rough, wooden sheep's head attached. The Tup was killed by a Butcher, and sometimes another boy held a basin to catch the \\"blood\\". There is a Sheffield version where the Tup is killed and then brought back to life by the Doctor. This is the main play performed by the Northstow Mummers based in Cambridge. An Owd 'Oss play (Old Horse), another dramatised folksong in Yorkshire, was also known from roughly the same area, in the late 19thThe Old Horse, Sheffield District, Yorkshire, 1888 and early 20th centuries,The Old Horse: Christmas Play from Notts. [1902] around Christmas. The custom persisted until at least 1970, when it was performed in private houses and pubs in Dore on New Year's Day. A group of men accompanied a hobby horse (either a wooden head, with jaws operated by strings, or a real horse's skull, painted black and red, mounted on a wooden pole so that its snapping jaws could be operated by a man stooping under a cloth to represent the horse's body) and sang a version of The Old Horse or Poor Old Horse, which describes a decrepit horse that is close to death. =Ireland= All known Irish play scripts are in English though Irish custom and tradition have permeated mumming ceremony with famous characters from Irish history ‚Äì Colmcille, Brian Boru, Art MacMorrough, Owen Roe O'Neill, Sarsfield and Wolfe Tone. The mummers are sometimes referred to as wrenboys. The main characters are usually the Captain, Beelzebub, Saint Patrick, Prince George, Oliver Cromwell, The Doctor and Miss Funny. =Scotland= In 1831 Sir Walter Scott published a rhyme which had been used as a prelude to the Papa Stour Sword Dance, Shetland in around 1788.Scott's Papa Stour Sword Dance ‚Äî 1788 It features seven characters, Saint George, Saint James, Saint Dennis, Saint David, Saint Patrick, Saint Anthony and Saint Andrew, the Seven Champions of Christendom. All the characters are introduced in turn by the Master, St. George. There is no real interplay between the characters and no combat or cure, so it is more of a \\"calling-on song\\" than a play. Some of the characters dance solos as they are introduced, then all dance a longsword dance together, which climaxes with their swords being meshed together to form a \\"shield\\". They each dance with the shield upon their head, then it is laid on the floor and they withdraw their swords to finish the dance. St. George makes a short speech to end the performance. Emily Lyle captured the oral history of fourteen people from the lowlands of Scotland recounting their memories of the 'seasonal folk dramas' known as Galoshins. Building on Emily Lyle's outstanding work, Brian Hayward researched the geographical distribution of the play in Scotland, and published \\"Galoshins; the Scottish folk play\\" which includes several maps showing the locations where each version was performed. These are or were largely across the Central Belt of Scotland, with a strange and unexplained \\"outlier\\" at Ballater in Aberdeenshire. Inspired by both these writers, and by folk play workshops at the Scottish Storytelling Centre, the Meadows Mummers are an all-female troupe who perform at local festivals and have recently (September 2019) returned from performing at the Scots Music School in Barga, Italy. Details about this group can be found on (1) the Scottish Museums and Galleries website, under the sub-heading \\"theatre\\", as \\"Galoshins; tradition with a difference\\", and (2) in an article for Memoria Imateria, (issue 2) on Intangible Cultural Heritage, under the title \\"Rescuing Galoshins\\". =Isle of Man= First recorded in 1832, the Manx White Boys play features a song and a sword dance at its conclusion. Although the key traditional characters include St. George, St. Patrick and others, modern versions frequently adapt the play to contemporary political concerns. Characters featured since the 1990s include Sir MHK, Sir Banker, Expert and Estate Agent. A a book on the White Boys compiled and edited by Stephen Miller was published in 2010; \\"Who wants to see the White Boys act?\\" The Mumming Play in the Isle of Man: A Compendium of Sources. It continues to be performed on the Saturday before Christmas each year. =Philadelphia= In Philadelphia every New Year's Day there is a Mummers' Day Parade that showcases pageantry and creativity. This grand parade has history in the old world, and performances in Philadelphia began in the year 1900. The parade traces back to mid-17th-century roots, blending elements from Swedish, Finnish, Irish, English, German, and other European heritages, as well as African heritage. The parade is related to the Mummers Play tradition from Britain and Ireland. Revivals of this tradition are still celebrated annually in South Gloucestershire, England on Boxing Day along with other locations in England and in parts of Ireland on St. Stephen's Day and also in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador around Christmas. Other types of mummers Mummers on holiday Koleda in Belgorod Oblast, Russia, 2012 =Feast entertainers= Mumming was used as a means of entertaining at feasts and functions, particular mention is made of one feast where 150 torch bearers lead the same number of mummers in, who would do acrobatics in a variety of costumes, including animal costumes. =Social mumming= At certain feast days (e.g. saint's days), a lot of the populace would put on masks, and in practices that vary with geography, celebrate the day. One practice in example was for a group to visit a local manor, and 'sing out' the lord. If the lord couldn't match verse for verse the singing group (alternating verses), then that lord would have to provide amenities. The formation of roving mumming groups became a popular practice so common it became associated with criminal or lewd behaviour, as the use of masks allowed anonymity; in the time of Henry VIII, it was banned for a period. =Aristocratic mumming= On documents such as receipts and bills from the late medieval, come details of mumming parties organised by English monarchs, Henry VIII being known for taking his court mumming incognito. Later, Henry would ban social mumming, and bring the 'masque' form of entertainment to England. =Newfoundland mummers= \\"Mummering\\" is a Newfoundland custom that dates back to the time of the earliest settlers who came from England and Ireland. It shares common antecedents with the Mummers Play tradition, but in its current form is primarily a house-visiting tradition. Sometime during the Twelve Days of Christmas, usually on the night of the \\"Old Twelfth\\" (17 January; equivalent to 6 January in the old Julian calendar), people would disguise themselves with old articles of clothing and visit the homes of their friends and neighbours. They would at times cover their faces with a hood, scarf, mask or pillowcase to keep their identity hidden. In keeping with the theme of an inversion of rules, and of disguise, crossdressing was a common strategy, and men would sometimes dress as women and women as men. Travelling from house to house, some mummers would carry their own musical instruments to play, sing and dance in the houses they visited. The host and hostess of these 'mummers parties' would serve a small lunch which could consist of Christmas cake with a glass of syrup or blueberry or dogberry wine. Some mummers would drink a Christmas \\"grog\\" before they leave each house, a drink of an alcoholic beverage such as rum or whiskey. One important part of the custom was a guessing game to determine the identity of the visitors. As each mummer was identified, they would uncover their faces, but if their true identity is not guessed they did not have to unmask. The Mummers Festival takes place throughout December and includes workshops on how to make hobby horses and wren sticks.Newfoundland & Labrador ICH Update No 12 (Dec 2009)Mummers Festival website: Traditions =Philadelphia mummers= Mummers plays were performed in Philadelphia in the 18th century as part of a wide variety of working-class street celebrations around Christmas. By the early 19th century, it coalesced with two other New Year customs, shooting firearms, and the Pennsylvania German custom of \\"belsnickling\\" (adults in masks questioning children about whether they had been good during the previous year). Through the 19th century, large groups of disguised (often in blackface) working class young men roamed the streets on New Year's Day, organizing \\"riotous\\" processions, firing weapons into the air, and demanding free drinks in taverns, and generally challenging middle and upper-class notions of order and decorum. Unable to suppress the custom, by the 1880s the city government began to pursue a policy of co-option, requiring participants to join organized groups with designated leaders who had to apply for permits and were responsible for their groups actions. By 1900, these groups formed part of an organized, city-sanctioned parade with cash prizes for the best performances. About 15,000 mummers now perform in the parade each year. They are organized into four distinct types of troupes: Comics, Fancies, String Bands, and Fancy Brigades. All dress in elaborate costumes. There is a Mummers Museum dedicated to the history of Philadelphia Mummers. Mummers in fiction Thomas Hardy's novel The Return of the Native (1878) has a fictional depiction of a mummers' play on Edgon Heath. It was based on experience from his childhood. Leo Tolstoy's novel War and Peace (1869) has a depiction of mummers, including Nikolai Rostov, Natasha Rostova, and Sonya Rostova, making house-to-house visits. They are depicted as a boisterous crowd dancing and laughing in outrageous costumes where men are dressed as women and women are dressed as men. Ngaio Marsh's detective story Off with His Head (1957) is set around a particular version of the Guiser play / Sword Dance, the fictional \\"Dance of the Five Sons\\", performed on the \\"Sword Wednesday\\" of the Winter Solistice. The characters used in that dance are describes in great detail, in particular \\"The Fool\\", \\"The Hobbyhorse\\" and \\"The teaser\\" (called \\"Betty\\"). Music There are several traditional songs associated with mumming plays; the \\"calling-on\\" songs of sword dance teams are related: *\\"The Singing of the Travels\\" by the Symondsbury Mummers, appears on SayDisc CD-SDL425 English Customs and Traditions (1997) along with an extract from the Antrobus, Cheshire, Soulcakers' Play It also appears on the World Library of Folk and Primitive Music.

Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into nearby Lake Chelan via Prince Creek and Cascade Creek. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Finney Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Finney Peak can have snow on it from early-fall to late-spring, and can be very cold in the winter. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Fjeldstad was born in R√∏yken. He received his candidatus realium degree at the Royal Frederick University and became an assistant professor of geophysics in 1922 at the University Museum of Bergen. It was Fjeldstad that correctly assumed the existence of the Lomonosov Ridge, which divides the Arctic Ocean into two large ocean basins. To determine this, he used wave data collected by Harald Sverdrup. Fjeldstad continued studying waves for his doctoral degree in 1930, and he developed a general theory of how the ocean's internal waves behave (published as Interne Wellen, Internal Waves, 1933). In 1939 he became a lecturer at the University of Oslo, and he was a professor from 1947 to 1964. He died in Oslo.

It was listed as a Historic Monument in 1933. The church was built near the site of the former villa Clippiacum that belonged to King Dagobert I and that was the Meorvingian birthplace of the city. It is located on Rue du Planty, named after the 19th- century mayor of the city who restored the church. The building stands on a small hill on which a few vines are planted. History 1901 photograph by Eug√®ne Atget. St. Ouen died on that place in 686. Hilduin reported that a chapel was located there in 832. The chapel was built on the bank of the Seine and kept its relics; thus it became a pilgrimage site. In the 12th century, a Romanesque chapel was built on the same site. The choir and the capitals were sculpted with acanthus leaves between the 1140s and the 1160s. The keystone from the House of Cond√© was added in the 16th century, while the fa√ßade was ended during the reign of Henry IV. The portal was destroyed during the Wars of Religion and re-built in the 17th century. The 18th-century organ was vandalised in 2006.In 1976, the mayor undertook restoration works performed by architects Brasilier, Thyrault and Plankaert.

He became a major figure in the \\"rubble literature\\" period, and his famous novel Berlin Finale, published in 1947, was one of the first bestsellers of the German rebuilding period. Early life Heinz Rein worked as a bank clerk in the 1920s after completing a banking apprenticeship. He later worked as a sports journalist. Because of his political commitments, the National Socialist rulers imposed a writing ban on him in 1934; consequently, in 1935, Rein became unemployed Katrin Hillgruber: Im Schatten der Blockwalter, Rezension, in: Frankfurter Rundschau, 9. Mai 2015, S. 34 During the war, he was subject to compulsory service at the German National Railway and at times Rein was in Gestapo detention. After the war's end, he worked for the Cultural Advisory Board for Publishing at the East German Administration for Public Education until 1950. The Cultural Advisory Board was initially tasked with removing from circulation work of a fascist or militaristic nature, but evolved to enforce official communist party cultural policy.  Career  Rein wrote literary criticism that was published in 1947/48 in the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (GDR) magazine Einheit - Theoretical Monthly Journal for Socialism.Unter anderem ‚ÄûDie gro√üe Literatur des kleinen Mannes ‚Äì Der Fall Fallada‚Äú im Augustheft 1948.

In 1949, he published the anthology Unterm Notdach, Berlin Tales. In 1950, according to preliminary remarks on behalf of the chairman of the Cultural Advisory Board, Erich Weinert, an attempt was made to survey the narrative prose that appeared in Germany after the war and was published under the title The New Literature. In addition to his own contributions, the work contains two reviews of Berlin Finale, by Hans Mayer (pp. 315‚Äì319) and by Walter A. Berendsohn (pp. 319‚Äì324). Initiated by Johannes R. Becher,‚ÄûBedauerlich und sch√§dlich. Bemerkungen zu einer ‚ÄöNeuen Literatur‚Äò‚Äú, in: Berliner Zeitung, Nr. 83, 7.

He then lived as a freelance writer in the GDR. After breaking with them in the early 1950s, he moved to West Germany. There he lived in Baden-Baden until his death. His books on the end of the war and the immediate postwar period in Berlin, made him an East German representative of rubble literature (Tr√ºmmerliteratur). In the GDR, some of his books were printed with difficulty and with a delay. After moving to the West, he wrote mainly short stories, but also satires and cabaret texts. Fritz J. Raddatz wrote an afterword for the new edition of Berlin Finale in 2015. The novel appeared in a preprint from 6 October 1946 to 16 February 1947 in the Berliner Zeitung, and the book came out in 1947.

The English translation of E Walea is \\"relaxing at ease with the gentle voices of the birds\\".

Since early 2017, the U.S. and other Coalition partners have also targeted the Syrian government and its allies via airstrikes and aircraft shoot-downs. Map of the first round of U.S. and coalition strikes in Syria  2014 = September 2014: Airstrikes begin= Tomahawk cruise missile launching from to strike ISIL targets in Syria on 23 September On 22 September, Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby confirmed that the United States and other partner nations had undertaken strikes in Syria using fighters, bombers, and Tomahawk missiles in strikes authorized by President Barack Obama. Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were identified as countries conducting or supporting airstrikes the first night. The initial strikes were coordinated by United States Central Command and targeted about 20 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant targets, including headquarters buildings. Sources in Syria claimed that among the targets was also Brigade 93, a Syrian army base that the militants had recently captured and targets in the towns of Tabqa and Tell Abyad in Raqqa Province. The U.S. also targeted the al-Qaeda- affiliated al-Nusra Front and the Khorasan Group in the Aleppo and Idlib Governorates of Syria. F-22 Raptor stealth fighters were reported to be among the U.S. aircraft striking targets in Syria on the first night of the campaign, carrying out their first combat missions ever since entering service in 2005. At least 70 ISIL fighters, 50 fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda, and eight civilians were killed overnight by the airstrikes, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights while eight strikes were launched against the Khorasan group. Syrian military radar was \\"passive\\" during the first air strikes, with no attempt to counter US aircraft.

This was done in retaliation against ISIL's brutal murder of Muath al-Kasasbeh. On 6 February, a continued round of Coalition airstrikes at Raqqa killed over 30 ISIL militants. On 21 February, Syrian Kurds launched an offensive to retake ISIL-held territories in the Al-Hasakah Governorate, specifically in the Tell Hamis area, with support from U.S. airstrikes. At least 20 villages were liberated, and 12 militants were killed in the clashes. In response, on 23 February, ISIL abducted 150 Assyrian Christians from villages near Tell Tamer in northeastern Syria, after launching a large offensive in the region. As a result of ISIL's massive offensive in the west Al-Hasakah Governorate, the U.S.-led Coalition increased the number of airstrikes in the region to 10, on 24 February, in order to halt the ISIL advance. The airstrikes struck nine ISIL tactical units and destroyed two ISIL vehicles. On 26 February, the number of Assyrian Christians abducted by ISIL from villages in northeastern Syria from 23‚Äì25 February rose to at least 220, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a monitoring group based in Britain. On 27 February, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party and Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Kurdish fighters had recaptured the town of Tell Hamis, along with most of the villages occupied by ISIL in the region. At least 127 ISIL militants were killed in the clashes, along with 30 YPG and allied fighters. One Australian volunteer, who was fighting for the YPG, was also killed. Many of the remaining ISIL militants retreated to Tell Brak, which quickly came under assault from the YPG and allied Arab fighters. =March‚ÄìApril 2015: Battle of Sarrin and expanded Canadian and UK efforts= On 1 March 2015, YPG fighters, aided by U.S. airstrikes, were able to drive ISIL militants out of Tell Brak, reducing the ISIL occupation in the eastern Jazira Canton to the villages between Tell Brak and Tell Hamis. On 6 March, it was reported that Abu Humam al-Shami, al- Nusra's military chief, was killed in a U.S. airstrike targeting a meeting of top al-Nusra leaders, at the al-Nusra Front's new headquarters at Salqin. On 9 March, the U.S. carried out another airstrike on the al-Nusra Front, targeting a military camp near Atimah, close to the Turkish border in the Idlib Governorate. The airstrike left nine militants dead. On 24 March, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Canada would be looking to expand Operation Impact to include airstrikes against ISIL in Syria as well. On 26 March, the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence announced the deployment of around 75 military trainers and headquarter staff to Turkey and other nearby countries in the anti-ISIL coalition, to assist with the U.S.-led training programme in Syria. The programme was set to provide small arms, infantry tactics and medical training to Syrian moderate opposition forces for over three years. On 30 March, the House of Commons of Canada authorized the extended deployment of its military for one year and to conduct operations related to the war in Syria. On 8 April, Canada initiated airstrikes in Syria, with two CF-18 fighters bombing a former military installation of the Syrian government that was captured by ISIL, near its headquarters in Raqqa. =May 2015: Al-Amr special forces raid= On 15 May, after surveillance by British special forces confirmed the presence of a senior ISIL leader named Abu Sayyaf in al-Amr, 1st SFOD-Delta operators from the Joint Special Operations Command based in Iraq conducted an operation to capture him. The operation resulted in his death when he tried to engage U.S. forces in combat and the capture of his wife Umm Sayyaf. The operation also led to the freeing of a Yazidi woman who was held as a slave. About a dozen ISIL fighters were also killed in the raid, two U.S. officials said. The SOHR reported that an additional 19 ISIL fighters were killed in the U.S. airstrikes that accompanied the raid. One official said that ISIL Forces fired at the U.S. aircraft, and there was reportedly hand-to-hand combat during the raid. UH-60 Black Hawk and V-22 Osprey helicopters were used to conduct the raid, and Umm Sayyaf was held by U.S. forces in Iraq. CNN reported that a senior U.S. military official revealed that in May 2015, U.S. special operations forces came \\"tantalisingly close\\" to capturing or killing ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Raqqa, but failed to do so because classified information was leaked to the news media. Secretary of State John Kerry with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, before a bilateral meeting focused on Syria, 2015 Coalition air support was decisive in the YPG victory over ISIL in the May 2015 Western al-Hasakah offensive. =June‚ÄìJuly 2015= U.S. air support, particularly from the 9th Bomb Squadron, was decisive in the YPG victory over ISIL in the Second Battle of Sarrin. Coalition air support was also decisive in the YPG/FSA victory over ISIL in the Tell Abyad offensive. Following a 20 July suicide bombing in the ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province of Turkey, believed to have been carried out by ISIL militants, as well as an ISIL cross-border attack that killed a Turkish serviceman on 23 July, Turkish armour and aircraft struck ISIL targets in cross-border engagements in northern Syria. Turkey also agreed to let the United States use the USAF Incirlik Air Base for strikes against ISIL. =August‚ÄìOctober 2015: UK drone strike and Canada ceases airstrikes= On 21 August, three Islamic State fighters, two of United Kingdom nationality, were targeted and killed in Raqqa by a British Royal Air Force MQ-9 Reaper strike. Prime Minister David Cameron gave a statement to Parliament that one of the British nationals targeted had been plotting attacks in the UK. Another British national was killed in a separate air strike by U.S. forces in Raqqa on 24 August. Military situation in November 2015 In October 2015, 50 U.S. special forces operators were deployed to northern Syria to help train and coordinate anti-ISIL forces in the region. The introduction of Russian aircraft and ship based cruise missiles in support of the Syrian Government to Syrian airspace created new threats to the U.S.-led coalition. Discussions were held to deconflict Syrian airspace. On 10 October, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported claims that two U.S. F-16 jets had \\"violated Syrian airspace\\" and bombed two electricity power plants in al-Rudwaniya, east Aleppo, \\"in breach of international law\\". On 20 October, Canada's Prime Minister-elect Justin Trudeau informed Barack Obama by phone of Canada's intention to pull out of bombing raids in Syria. Canada would remain a coalition partner but will stop strikes. =November‚ÄìDecember 2015: French retaliation and the UK officially begins airstrikes= YPG fighters in November 2015 After deadly terror attacks in Paris conducted by jihadists, French President Francois Hollande sent France's only aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, with its 26 fighters to intensify air strikes. On 27 November, SANA claimed that the coalition targeted water pumping stations in al-Khafsah area, east of Aleppo, causing them to go out of service. According to Bellingcat's investigation, however, it was a Russian MoD bombing. On 2 December, the UK parliament voted 397‚Äì223 in favour of airstrikes in Syria. Within hours, RAF Tornado jets carried out their first air strikes, targeting the al-Omar oil fields near Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria, which were under ISIL control. On 6 December, a Syrian Arab Army base at Deir ez-Zor was struck, killing at least one Syrian Arab Army soldier, with reports circulating that as many as four were killed, 13 wounded and two tanks destroyed. Syria accused the U.S. of conducting the strike; however, U.S. officials denied this, stating instead that the bombing was a mistake by Russians. After the airstrikes, the SAA reported that ISIL forces began to attack the base.  2016  =March‚ÄìApril 2016: Continued special forces operations= On 4 March, a U.S.-led Coalition airstrike targeted Omar al- Shishani, ISIL's top field commander, who was travelling in a convoy near al- Shaddadi in northeastern Syria. The strike injured him, and there were reports that he died from his injuries. However, this proved to be incorrect and he was actually killed later in an airstrike in Iraq in July 2016. Also on 4 March, 100 ISIL militants assaulted Peshmerga lines in Syria; U.S. Navy SEAL Charles Keating IV helped the Peshmerga to repel the attack. As ISIL fighters sent a car bomb towards him, Keating led a team to counterattack with sniper and rocket fire. For his actions during the battle, he was posthumously awarded the Silver Star. On 24 March, U.S. special operations forces conducted an operation with the intent of capturing Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli in Syria. Al-Qaduli, then the 6th most wanted terrorist in the world and, according to analysts, the then-second-in-command of ISIL, acting as the group's finance minister and was involved in external plots; he also temporarily commanded ISIL after a commander was injured. U.S. Special forces inserted by helicopter and laid in wait to intercept his vehicle; the operators attempted to capture him but the situation escalated and, at the last moment, they decided to fire on the vehicle instead, killing al-Qaduli and 3 other militants. On 25 April, it was reported that U.S. President Barack Obama authorized the deployment of an additional 250 special operations soldiers to Syria. In the following weeks, they are to join the 50 that are already in the country; their main aim is to advise, assist and expand the ongoing effort to bring more Syrian Arab fighters into units the U.S. supports in northern Syria to combat ISIL. =May 2016= Secretary of State John Kerry with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir during a meeting on Syria in May 2016 In late May 2016, more than a dozen U.S. special forces troops were seen in the village of Fatisah, less than north of Raqqa. They were fighting near the front lines with the YPG and wearing both YPG and U.S. insignia on their military uniforms; the operators were helping call in fire support for local SDF forces and coordinating airstrikes from behind the front lines in their advance toward Raqqa. However, the Pentagon and White House insisted that the troops were not fighting ISIL on the front lines and were still participating in a non-combat mission known as \\"train, advise and assist.\\" Also in late May, a U.S. special forces operator was wounded north of Raqqa by indirect ISIL rocket or mortar fire. The Telegraph reported that British special forces had been operating on the frontline in Syria, particularly in May when they frequently crossed the border from Jordan to defend a New Syrian Army (NSA) rebel unit composed of former Syrian special forces as it defended the village of al-Tanf against ISIL attacks. They mostly helped the unit with logistics such as building defenses and making bunkers safe. The NSA captured the village that month and faced regular ISIL attacks; an ISIL SVBIED drove into the base and killed 11 members of the NSA and injuring 17 others. The wounded were CASEVAC'd by U.S. helicopters to Jordan; the suicide attack damaged the structure of the al-Tanf base; British troops crossed over from Jordan to help them to rebuild their defences. =June 2016: Kurdish offensive to take Manbij= On 1 June, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News that a \\"thousands\\"-strong SDF force consisting of Sunni Arab fighter and a small contingent of Kurdish fighters (mainly from the YPG) with assistance by U.S. special forces operators and fighter jets launched an operation to recapture the strategically important ISIL-held city of Manbij in northern Syria, from the border with Turkey; ISIL used the town to move supplies and foreign fighters into Syria from Turkey. In the 24 hours since the start of offensive, 18 U.S. airstrikes destroyed ISIL headquarters buildings, weapons caches, training areas, six bridges and an unknown number of ISIL fighters were killed; 15 civilians were also reported killed. USAFCENT CAOC at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar provides command and control of air power throughout Iraq and Syria. On 3 June, F/A-18 Hornets launched from conducted air strikes against ISIS targets in Syria from the eastern Mediterranean. It was the first time the U.S. Navy had conducted strike missions in the Middle East from the Mediterranean Sea since flying operations against the Iraqi military in 2003. By 9 June, the U.S. Central Command said the Coalition had conducted more than 105 strikes in support of the SDF's advance; French special forces were offering training and advice to SDF fighters in the area and on 15 June, British special forces were also reported to be operating in the area. Much of the SDF advance was made possible by Coalition air support, with airstrikes being directed by special forces personnel on the ground. On the same day, four U.S. special operations troops in northern Syria were \\"lightly\\" wounded by shrapnel when an Islamic State anti-tank missile fired at a nearby vehicle exploded, but they quickly returned to duty. On 16 June, supposedly as part of Russia's campaign to pressure the U.S. to agree to closer cooperation over Syria, Russian military aircraft bombed, with cluster bombs, a military outpost in al-Tanf in southeast Syria that was garrisoned by the New Syrian Army (NSA); U.S. and British special forces based in Jordan regularly worked with Syrian rebels at the al-Tanf outpost. The airstrike happened 24 hours after a detachment of 20 British special forces left the outpost. After the airstrike took place, U.S. commanders warned Russia that the garrison was part of the international coalition against ISIL and therefore should not be attacked, but 90 minutes later, nearby U.S. warplanes observed Russian jets dropping a second barrage of bombs on the outpost, killing four rebel soldiers. A U.S. spy plane overhead tried to contact the Russian pilots on emergency frequencies, but the Russians did not answer. U.S. officials demanded an explanation from Moscow, but they were told the Russian pilots struck the outpost because they \\"thought it was an ISIL base\\", Russian officials then said that Jordan had approved the strikes in advance, but Jordan denied this. Moscow also claimed its air command headquarters in Syria was unable to call off the strikes because the U.S. had not given them the precise position of the outpost. On 29 June, as part of the 2016 Abu Kamal offensive ‚Äî the offensive by the Pentagon-trained New Syrian Army and several hundred other rebels from different factions that aimed to capture Abu Kamal and sever ISIL's transit link between Syria and Iraq ‚Äî rebel forces entered the al-Hamdan air base ‚Äî northwest of the border town Abu Kamal following intense clashes. This followed significant advances into ISIL-held territory near the Abu Kamal border crossing, the NSA said it had captured a number of ISIL positions on the outskirts of Abu Kamal, but a raid on the town at dawn was reported to have been repelled by militants. Fighting continued around the town, as coalition airstrikes were carried out on ISIL hideouts; the NSA also said it was coordinating the assault with Iraqi government forces, who were advancing on the border from the other side. The NSA issued a statement saying \\"the NSA maintains control of the desert, the approaches to Abu Kamal, and maintains freedom of manoeuvre\\". later on that day, ISIL militants ambushed the rebels, inflicting heavy casualties and seizing weapons, according to a rebel source. ISIL retook the airbase from the NSA and continued to advance against the rebels, recapturing some of the outposts the NSA had captured south of the town; Coalition helicopters dropped in \\"foreign\\" airborne troops on the southern edge of Abu Kamal to help the rebels in their advance; coalition jets also carried out eight airstrikes on ISIL targets in the Abu Kamal area. A contributing reasons for the failure of the U.S.-backed rebel operation was the withdrawing of air support at a critical moment; the aircraft assigned to the operation were ordered in the middle of the operation to leave the area and instead fly to the outskirts of Fallujah, where a large convoy of ISIL fighters, which U.S. commanders considered a \\"strategic target\\", had been seen trying to escape across the desert after the city was recaptured by the Iraqi army. The convoy was eliminated by American and British planes along with gunships and aircraft from the Iraqi air force. =August 2016: Operation Euphrates Shield= On 7 August, as part of Operation Tidal Wave II, \\"multiple\\" coalition warplanes destroyed some 83 oil tankers used by the Islamic State near Abu Kamal. CNN reported that the Coalition carried out airstrikes in support of the Turkish intervention in Syria with Syrian opposition forces in August 2016, which seized the town of Jarabulus from ISIL and pushed south and west in an effort to clear the terror group from its border. U.S. special forces had initially intended to accompany the offensive but the U.S. was still working on approving the proposal when Turkish units pushed across the border. On 30 August, the New York Times reported that Abu Mohammad al-Adnani was killed while traveling in a vehicle by a U.S. drone strike in Al-Bab. CNN reported that al-Adnani was a key deputy to ISIL's leader, he also acted as the principal architect in ISIL's external operations and as the group's spokesman; he also coordinated the movements of their fighters - directly encouraging them to carryout lone-wolf attacks on civilians and military targets. The strike marked the highest-profile killing of an ISIL member thus far. =September‚ÄìOctober 2016: Coalition air raid on Deir ez-Zor= On 8 September, an airstrike allegedly carried out by the United States killed Abu Hajer al-Homsi (nom de guerre Abu Omar Saraqib), the top military commander of the renamed al-Nusra Front (Jabhat Fateh al-Sham) in the countryside of the Aleppo Governorate. Abu Hajer al-Homsi was one of the founding members of the al-Nusra Front and had taken part in the Iraq War against the U.S. when he was part of the processor organization al-Qaeda in Iraq. The Pentagon denied carrying out the strike and instead claimed Russia was responsible. On 16 September, CNN reported that up to 40 U.S. special forces operators were accompanying Turkish troops and vetted Syrian opposition forces as they cleared ISIL from northern Syria. The mission, called Operation Noble Lance, was authorised that week and was now underway. Officially, the U.S. personnel were to conduct the same type of \\"advising, assisting and training\\" missions that the U.S. had been providing to moderate opposition and local anti-ISIL forces. The Washington Post reported that the contingent of Special Operations forces (SOF) assisting the Turkish and Syrian rebel forces around the cities of Jarabulus and al-Rai were sent at the request of the Turkish government. On 17 September, two U.S. A-10s, two Danish F-16s, and a UK Reaper drone mistakenly bombed a Syrian Army-controlled base in the ISIL- besieged city of Deir ez-Zor. More than 62 Syrian soldiers were killed and at least 100 were wounded in the airstrike. ISIL forces attacked immediately after the Coalition airstrike and took the strategically important elevation near Deir ez-Zor airbase: Tharda (Thurda) mountain. According to Russian and Syrian government sources, SAA forces, supported by Russian and Syrian airstrikes, counterattacked and recaptured Tharda mountain by the end of the day, suffering additional losses, including one Syrian jet fighter. The USAF immediately issued an official explanation \\\\- it was a navigation\\\\intelligence mistake and bombing was stopped after Russian Air Force contact informed them about the SAA loses. The Danish Air Force confirmed that their two F-16 fighters participated in the airstrike, insisting that operations stopped the split-second they received the message from the Russians and explaining it as a mistake and was regretting the losses. Russian officials accused the U.S. in helping ISIL due to the air raid. Russia also called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council over the airstrike and the U.S. temporarily ceased airstrikes in the area. In response to the errant airstrike, the Syrian Armed Forces called it a \\"serious and blatant attack on Syria and its military\\". On 3 October, Ahmad Salama Mabruk, a senior al-Nusra Front and previously Egyptian Islamic Jihad commander, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Jisr al-Shughur. =November 2016= FSA loads a U.S.-made M2 Browning heavy machine gun in northern Aleppo, November 2016 On 18 November, a U.S. airstrike killed an Afghan al-Nusra Front commander, Abu Afghan al-Masri, in the town of Sarmada. On 24 November, the Washington Post reported that Senior Chief Petty Officer Scott C. Dayton of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 2 was killed by an IED near Ayn Issa - roughly 35 miles northwest of ISIL's self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa. It was the first time a U.S. service member was killed in Syria since a contingent of SOF was deployed there in October 2015. CNN reported that on 26 November, a U.S. drone strike in Raqqa killed Boubaker Hakim, a senior ISIL terrorist suspected of enabling the Sousse terrorist attack as he had connections to the Tunisian ISIL cell that carried out the attack and the Bardo National Museum attack. Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said, \\"His removal degrades ISIL's ability to conduct further attacks in the West and denies ISIL a veteran extremist with extensive ties.\\" Stars and Stripes reported that in November 2016, airmen from the 621st Contingency Response Wing with a contingent of civil engineers, intelligence personnel, and security forces were temporarily deployed to expand and modify the airstrip that the airmen had established earlier in 2016 at an airbase where they deployed to near Kobani, so it can be used to assist in the offensive to retake Raqqa. The airbase gave the U.S. an additional location for its aircraft to support the Coalition and other anti-ISIL forces, but it had been used by U.S. forces limitedly due to the condition of the runway which restricted what types of aircraft could land there. General Carlton Everhart II, commander of U.S. Air Mobility Command, said that the base enabled aircraft to deliver critical supplies, equipment and help position forces; he added that airmen from the 621st group have supported anti-ISIL coalition forces on the ground in Syria. =December 2016= On 4 December, it was reported that a U.S. airstrike in Raqqa killed three key ISIL leaders, two of whom (Salah Gourmat and Sammy Djedou) were involved in plotting the November 2015 Paris attacks. On 8 December, during the 4th Palmyra offensive, U.S.-led Coalition warplanes bombed an ISIL convoy near Palmyra in central Syria and destroyed 168 trucks carrying petroleum. On 10 December, it was reported that the U.S. was sending 200 more special operations personnel to Syria, joining the 300 U.S. special forces already in the country. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said the troops would include special forces trainers, advisers and bomb disposal teams and that they will \\"continue organising, training, equipping, and otherwise enabling capable, motivated, local forces\\" to take the fight to ISIL. In particular, the troops will assist SDF forces in the ongoing Raqqa offensive; France also continues to have special operations units in the country. The New York Times reported that on 15 December, Coalition warplanes destroyed 14 Syrian Army T-72 battle tanks, three artillery systems and a number of buildings and vehicles that ISIL militants were using at a military base in central Syria that they seized the previous weekend from Syrian troops and their Russian advisers. On 31 December, a Coalition airstrike in Raqqa killed Mahmud al-Isawi, al-Isawi was an ISIL member who supported the organization's media and intelligence structure in Fallujah before relocating to Raqqa. His role in the group was controlling the flow of instructions and finances between ISIL-held areas and ISIL leaders and provided support to propaganda and intelligence outlets; he was also known to have facilitated trans-regional travel with other ISIL external operations coordinators and had a close working and personal relationship with Abd al- Basit al-Iraqi, the emir of ISIL's Middle East attack network, according to the U.S. defense department.  2017  Joseph Dunford, Hulusi Akar and Valery Gerasimov discussing their nations‚Äô operations in northern Syria, March 2017 =January 2017= On 1 January 2017, a United States drone strike killed Abu Omar al-Turkistani, a Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and Turkistan Islamic Party military commander, and three other JFS members near the town of Sarmada in the northern Idlib Governorate. On 2 January, more than 25 JFS members were killed in an air raid by suspected U.S. warplanes. On 6 January, as part of the Raqqa offensive, SDF forces, supported by American special forces and international coalition aircraft, seized Qalaat Jaabar fortress after fierce fighting with ISIL jihadist fighters. On 8 January, coalition forces conducted a landing operation onto the road between the villages of Jazra and Kabr in the western Deir ez-Zor Governorate from four helicopters. The landing forces set up checkpoints on the road and raided a water plant in Kabr, where they killed and captured a number of ISIL fighters. After an hour and 15 minutes, the operation was complete and the forces withdrew. On 11 January, an air-to- surface missile launched from suspected U.S. aircraft hit a Jabhat Fatah al- Sham (JFS) convoy consisting of five vehicles and killed 14 JFS members. On 17 January, separate U.S. airstrikes in the Idlib Governorate killed Mohammad Habib Boussaboun al-Tunisi and Abd al-Jalil al-Muslimi, two Tunisian al-Qaeda external operations leaders. Also that day, it was reported that U.S. warplanes and combat advisers were supporting Turkish military units battling ISIL fighters in northern Syria, particularly at the Battle of al-Bab. On 19 January, U.S. airstrikes by B-52 strategic bombers struck the former Syrian Army Sheikh Suleiman military base near Darat Izza, in western Aleppo, which was used by Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement. The airstrike killed at least 110 JFS fighters and some al-Zenki fighters, including Abu Hasan al-Taftanaz, an al-Qaeda senior leader. Since 1 January 2017, more than 150 al-Qaeda members were killed by U.S. airstrikes in 2017. The Sheikh Suleiman base had been operated as a training camp by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and al-Zenki since 2013. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), between 22 September 2014 and 23 January 2017, U.S.-led Coalition airstrikes killed 7,043 people across Syria, of which: 5,768 dead were ISIL fighters, 304 al-Nusra Front militants and other rebels, 90 Syrian government soldiers and 881 civilians. = February 2017 = On 1 February, it was reported that the U.S.-led Coalition had conducted an airstrike on the Carlton Hotel in the city of Idlib, which local and NGO sources said was a Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) facility and which pro-government media said was used by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)'s former al-Nusra component for troop housing, and hosting meetings of prominent commanders. The Coalition denied responsibility, although an investigation of open source materials confirmed a strike had occurred and that a SARC facility was damaged. On 2 February, Sky News reported that Turkish aircraft killed 51 Islamic State fighters in the space of 24 hours in the areas of al-Bab, Tadef, Qabasin, and Bizaah. The airstrikes targeted buildings and vehicles resulting in 85 ISIL positions destroyed. According to Turkish military command, since the beginning of Operation Euphrates Shield, at least 1,775 ISIL militants had been \\"neutralised,\\" with more than 1,500 of those killed. On 3 February, U.S. airstrikes hit Jund al-Aqsa and Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) positions in Sarmin, near Idlib, and killed more than 12 militants. On the same day, the Royal Jordanian Air Force launched several airstrikes on ISIL outposts in southern Syria. On 4 February, a U.S. airstrike killed Abu Hani al-Masri, who was part of Ahrar al- Sham at the time of his death, but described by the Pentagon as a former al- Qaeda commander. It was reported that there was speculation that he was about to defect to Tahrir al-Sham before his death. On 26 February, in Al-Mastoumeh, Idlib, a U.S. drone strike killed Abu Khayr al-Masri, the deputy leader of al- Qaeda. He had been released and allowed into Syria as part of a prisoner swap between Iran and al-Qaeda in 2015. The U.S. airstrike also killed another Tahrir al-Sham militant, who was traveling in the same car. It was later revealed in May 2019 that the missile used in the airstrike was a Hellfire R9X, which has a kinetic warhead with pop-out blades, intended to reduce collateral damage. =March 2017: Regular U.S. forces arrive and the Battle of Tabqa= United States special operations forces near Manbij, acting as advisors to the Syrian Democratic Forces, March 2017 On 8 March, various news outlets reported that regular U.S. troops, part of an amphibious task force, left their ships in the Middle East and deployed to Syria to establish an outpost from which they can provide artillery support for U.S.-backed local forces who were preparing to assault Raqqa in a battle to liberate the city from ISIL control. The deployment marked a new escalation in the U.S.'s role in Syria and put more conventional U.S. troops on the ground, a role that, thus far, had primarily been filled by Special Operations units. The ground force was part of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit; 400 U.S. Marines from the Battalion Landing Team 1st Battalion, 4th Marines were tasked to crew an artillery battery of M777 howitzers whilst additional infantrymen from the unit will provide security. Resupplies were to be handled by a detachment of the expeditionary force's combat logistics element. A defense official with direct knowledge of the operation said the Marines were flown from Djibouti to Kuwait and then into Syria. By then, there were 900 U.S. soldiers and Marines deployed to Syria in total (500 special forces troops were already on the ground to train and support the SDF); under the existing limits put in place by the Obama administration, the formal troop cap for Syria is 503 personnel, but commanders have the authority to temporarily exceed that limit to meet military requirements. There were approximately 100 U.S. Army Rangers in Stryker vehicles and armored Humvees deployed in and around Manbij in northern Syria, U.S. officials said. Officially, they were deployed there to discourage Syrian, Russian, or Turkish troops from making any moves that could shift the focus away from an assault on ISIL militants, specifically preventing them from inadvertently coming under fire. The U.S. believed the pressure on ISIL in Raqqa was working - a U.S. official said that intelligence indicated some ISIL leadership and operatives were continuing to try to leave the city. He added that there was also U.S. intelligence indicating the city was laced with trenches, tunnels, roadside bombs and buildings wired to explode, which, if correct, indicated that the U.S. was able to gather intelligence from both overhead surveillance aircraft and people on the ground. However, the official also noted that \\"Raqqa will probably not be the final battle against ISIS\\" and added that the group still had some personnel dispersed in areas south and east of the city. According to the official, the U.S. estimated that ISIL could have had roughly as many as 4,000 fighters in Raqqa. An official told The Guardian that in addition, the U.S. was preparing to send hundreds of troops to Kuwait on stand-by to be ready to fight ISIL in Syria if needed and the number would be fewer than 1,000. The Independent reported that Colonel John Dorrian, a spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve, said the artillery unit and the Army Rangers would not have a front line role. U.S. Marines manning artillery in northern Syria, March 2017 On 16 March, a U.S. drone strike hit a mosque west of Aleppo and killed between 45 and 49 people, mostly civilians. The location was assessed by the U.S. military as a meeting place for al-Qaeda and claimed that the airstrike hit a target across the mosque and was not targeted at the mosque itself. Stars and Stripes reported that on 28 March, an airman assigned to the 21st Space Wing died in a non- combat incident (possibly of natural causes) in northern Syria. On 22 March, hundreds of SDF fighters, with an undisclosed number of U.S. Special Operations troops operating as their advisers, launched a large-scale heliborne assault on ISIL around the area of the Tabqa Dam. They were inserted on the southern bank of the Euphrates river behind ISIL's defenses to take them by surprise; Colonel Joe Scrocca, an OIR spokesman, said that as a result of the air insertion behind ISIL lines, the SOF-SDF force did not come under fire. The following day, there was heavy fighting in the area; Col. Scrocca added that the ground forces were supported by helicopter gunships, U.S. Marine 155mm artillery and U.S. airstrikes. Airwars reported that March 2017 saw the greatest number of munitions dropped during the war thus far - 3,878 munitions on ISIL targets in both Syria and Iraq, based on figures published by United States Air Forces Central Command - as well as the highest number of civilian deaths (between 477 and 1,216 non-combatants, 57% of which were in Syria) to date, likely caused by Coalition strikes, exceeding casualties caused by Russian strikes for the third consecutive month. Significant incidents that were attributed to Coalition strikes occurred in Tabqa and Kasrat al-Faraj during the Battle of Tabqa. The deadliest incident occurred in al-Mansoura, where local witnesses said at least 33 civilians were killed in a former school used to house displaced persons, although this was denied by the Coalition. =April 2017: Shayrat missile strike= U.S. Army Stryker vehicles drive through Qamishli onwards to the Syria-Turkey border after border clashes between the YPG and Turkey U.S. military transport helicopters fly over northeastern Syria On 6 April, U.S. special forces conducted a landing operation against ISIL west of Deir ez-Zor. Two Coalition helicopters airdropped soldiers in the area who then interdicted a car on route from Raqqa to Deir ez-Zor. During the operation, U.S. forces killed four ISIL commanders and extracted a Jordanian spy who had infiltrated ISIL and served as one of its leaders. CNN reported that the operation took place near Mayadin and that one of the ISIL commanders killed by U.S. forces was Abdurakhmon Uzbeki, a top facilitator and close associate of ISIL's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi; he was also connected to the 2017 New Year's nightclub bombing in Turkey. On 7 April, in response to chemical weapon attacks (most notably the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack) against Syrian civilians allegedly by the Syrian government, the U.S. launched missile strikes on the airfield from which the chemical weapon attacks were allegedly launched. This incident marked the first deliberate direct attack by the U.S. on the Assad government. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the attack as being based on false intelligence and against international law, suspended the Memorandum of Understanding on Prevention of Flight Safety Incidents that had been signed with the U.S., and called an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. On 8 April, ISIL militants attacked a U.S. garrison at al-Tanf in Southern Syria: the garrison's main gate was blown up with a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED), followed by a ground assault of about 20-30 ISIL militants, some of whom were wearing suicide vests. The U.S. Central Command said that the ‚Ä≥U.S. special operators‚Ä≥ at the base along with other coalition members and ‚Ä≥U.S.-backed Syrian fighters‚Ä≥, supported by multiple airstrikes, repelled the attack, with no American casualties. The Telegraph reported that during the battle, ISIL militants also ambushed a convoy of reinforcements from an allied rebel group who were trying to relieve the base. Protest against U.S. military actions in Syria, Minneapolis, April 2017 CNN reported that on 11 April, a misdirected U.S. airstrike near Tabqa, during the ongoing Raqqa offensive, killed 18 SDF soldiers. =May 2017= The BBC reported that on 9 May, a Royal Air Force drone strike stopped an ISIL-staged public killing. The hellfire missile killed an ISIL sniper positioned on a rooftop set to shoot civilians attempting to walk away. No civilians were harmed and other ISIL fighters fled on motorbikes. The Independent reported on 12 May that SDF forces had seized control of the Tabqa Dam after a deal struck by the SDF and around 70 ISIL militants; the deal included the dismantling of IEDs and booby traps, the surrender of heavy weaponry and withdrawal of remaining ISIL fighters from Tabqa city. On 18 May, the U.S. conducted airstrikes on a convoy of a pro-government militia during the 2017 Baghdad‚ÄìDamascus highway offensive. According to a U.S. defense official, before the strikes were conducted, government troops were warned they were getting too close to Coalition forces garrisoned at al-Tanf but did not respond. According to the U.S., four or five vehicles were destroyed, including a tank and two bulldozers. In contrast, the Syrian Army reported that two tanks were destroyed and a Shilka SPAAG was damaged. Eight soldiers were killed. =June 2017: Battle of Raqqa begins= United States Marine Corps howitzers provide fire support to the SDF during the Battle of Raqqa On 6 June, SDF ground troops backed by Coalition airstrikes launched the battle for Raqqa. USCENTCOM reported that 4,400 munitions were fired in support of operations in Raqqa, a dramatic increase from previous months. Also on 6 June, U.S. aircraft conducted airstrikes on over 60 troops, a tank, artillery, antiaircraft weapons, and armed technical vehicles from pro-government forces that had entered what the Coalition called the al-Tanf \\"deconfliction zone\\". On 8 June, a U.S. F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft shot down a drone and other aircraft destroyed two armed pick-up trucks belonging to pro-government forces that moved near U.S. backed fighters at al-Tanf. On 18 June, a U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Su-22 after it allegedly bombed an SDF position in Ja'Din, south of Tabqa. A statement by the Syrian Army claimed that the plane was on a mission to bomb ISIL militants. The same day, pro-government forces captured the village of Ja'Din following an SDF withdrawal. On 20 June, a U.S. F-15E shot down a pro-government Shahed 129 drone near al-Tanf after it \\"displayed hostile intent\\" and allegedly advanced towards Coalition forces. Across Iraq and Syria, Airwars tracked 223 reported Coalition airstrikes with civilian casualties during June 2017, likely killing a minimum of between 529 and 744 civilians (including at least 415 in Syria, mainly in Raqqa governorate, making it the second mostly deadly month for civilians since the strikes began in 2014. Significant reported incidents included 3 June in Raqqa (20 civilians), 5 June (hitting civilians fleeing conflict), and 8 June in Raqqa (including reported white phosphorus use and a mosque hit). =August 2017= On 21 August, U.S. forces in northern Syria were fired on by Turkish- backed Free Syrian Army units near Manbij, and returned fire in a short firefight. On 29 August, following the Qalamoun offensive, ISIL militants were surrounded by Lebanese, Hezbollah and Syrian forces on both sides of the Lebanon‚ÄìSyria border. They negotiated a safe-passage deal so that 670 ISIL fighters and their relatives would be taken from the border in vehicles to Abu Kamal. The U.S. military disapproved of the deal; Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition said the deal undermined efforts to fight the ISIL in Syria. U.S. aircraft carried out airstrikes, blocking the road the ISIL convoy was travelling on, before it reached ISIL-occupied territory in Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Dillon added that other U.S. airstrikes hit militants apparently attempting to join the stranded militants in the convoy. The Independent later reported that the convoy was trapped in between the towns of Humayma and al-Sukhnah. =September 2017= U.S. Green Berets during counter- ISIL operations in southern Syria, November 2017 On 3 September, the Independent reported that 400 ISIL militants and their families traveling in the convoy that was trapped by U.S. airstrikes in Syria in late August had abandoned their vehicles and began travelling on foot to the Iraqi border. =December 2017= CNN reported that on 12 December, Maghawir Al-Thawra fighters accompanied by U.S. advisers intercepted a convoy of about ten vehicles that was passing through the 55 km \\"de-confliction\\" zone surrounding the coalition base at al-Tanf; a firefight ensued, resulting in 21 ISIL fighters killed and a further 17 captured. CNN reported that on 13 December, two U.S. F-22A fighters intercepted two Russian Su-25 jets that crossed the \\"de-confliction line\\" multiple times. An Air Forces Central Command spokesman said that \\"The F-22s conducted multiple maneuvers to persuade the Su-25s to depart our de-conflicted airspace, including the release of chaff and flares in close proximity to the Russian aircraft and placing multiple calls on the emergency channel to convey to the Russian pilots that they needed to depart the area.\\" One U.S. defense official said that a Russian Su-35 fighter was also involved in the incident. On 22 December, Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said that Australia will end their air strikes against the Islamic State and recall its six Super Hornet aircraft. Payne added that other Australian operations in the region would continue, with 80 personnel who are part of the Special Operations Task Group in Iraq, including Australian special forces, continuing their deployment. 2018 =January 2018= Military Times reported on 12 January that Coalition aircraft carried out more than 90 airstrikes between January 4 and January 11 near the Iraq-Syria border. Military Times also reported that on 20 January, U.S. airstrikes targeting an ISIL headquarters and command and control center in the Middle Euphrates River Valley (MERV) near Al-Shaafah killed nearly 150 ISIL militants. According to a press release, SDF fighters provided target observation and intelligence on the target. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan criticized the United States' support for Kurdish YPG fighters in northern Syria. =February‚ÄìMarch 2018: The Khasham engagement= Kurdish YPG and YPJ fighters in February 2018 According to U.S. military officials, on 7 February, in deliberate air and artillery strikes, the U.S.-led coalition killed more than 100 pro-government fighters in the Euphrates River valley in Deir ez-Zor province after they launched an \\"unprovoked attack\\" against the Syrian Democratic Forces. Syrian state news corroborated the events, but insisted that the Kurdish forces were mixed in with ISIL forces; it also stated that ten Russian mercenaries were among those killed. CNN reported that on 30 March, Master Sergeant Jonathan J. Dunbar of Delta Force and Sergeant Matt Tonroe of the British Special Air Service were killed by an IED blast during a mission in Manbij, the objective of which was ‚Äî according to Pentagon spokesman Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway ‚Äî to \\"kill or capture a known ISIS member.\\" =April‚ÄìJune 2018= On 14 April, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S., France, and the United Kingdom had decided to carry out a series of military strikes against the Syrian government. The strikes came in the wake of the Douma chemical attack. On 1 May, the SDF, in coordination with the Iraqi Armed Forces, announced the resumption of their Deir ez-Zor offensive to capture the final ISIL enclaves near the Iraqi border and along the Euphrates. By 3 May, the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group had joined in support of the SDF's anti-ISIL operations. U.S. and Turkish forces conduct joint patrols on the outskirts of Manbij, Syria, 8 November 2018 =November 2018= On 1 November, the Coalition began a series of joint patrols with the Turkish Armed Forces along the frontlines of the Kurdish-controlled Manbij region and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army's territory. The move was seen as a part of a \\"roadmap\\" to ease tensions between the NATO ally and U.S. backed Kurdish forces. and reduce violence between Kurdish and Turkish-backed elements. On 21 November, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced the U.S. would set up new observation posts along the Turkish border in northern Syria in order to reduce skirmishes between Turkish forces and armed Kurdish militants in the region such as the border clashes in late October-early November. Mattis affirmed that it was a co-operational endeavor with Turkey and it will not require additional U.S. troops to be deployed to Syria. =December 2018: Announcement of U.S. withdrawal= Military situation in December 2018: CJTF-OIR airstrike on an ISIL fuel truck in al-Susah, 29 November 2018 President Donald Trump, declaring \\"we have won against ISIS,\\" unilaterally announced on 19 December 2018 that the remaining 2,000-2,500 U.S. troops in Syria would be withdrawn. Trump made the announcement on Twitter, overruling the recommendations of his military commanders and civilian advisors, with apparently no prior consultation with Congress. Although no timetable was provided, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders indicated that the withdrawal had already been ordered. Various sources indicated that Trump had directed that the withdrawal be completed within 30 days. However, Reuters was told by a U.S. official that the withdrawal was expected to take 60 to 100 days. Following Trump's surprise announcement, the Pentagon and State Department tried to change his mind, with several of his congressional and political allies expressing serious concerns about the sudden move, specifically that it would hand control of the region to Russia and Iran and abandon America's Kurdish allies. CNN reported on 24 December that during the weeks before Trump's withdrawal announcement, national security advisor John Bolton told senior officials to meet directly with anti-ISIL coalition partners to assure them that America would remain in Syria until Iran had left. One senior administration official commented that Trump's decision was \\"a complete reversal,\\" done \\"without deliberation,\\" reportedly leaving allies and partners \\"bewildered.\\" According to one CNN analysis, the announcement reportedly came as the Coalition had reason to believe ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his top commanders were possibly cornered in a small pocket of northern Syria, \\"in a Tora Bora situation\\" akin to the region where al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden escaped from American forces in 2001. On 27 December, administration officials stated that USCENTCOM's troop withdrawal plan entailed the withdrawal taking place over several months instead of weeks, falling in line with Trump's post-announcement comments that the pullout of U.S. troops would be \\"deliberate and orderly.\\" By the end of the month, it remained unclear whether anti-ISIL air operations would continue post-withdrawal. By 31 December, after U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham and a group of generals held a luncheon with the president over the withdrawal, Graham tweeted that Trump would seek a more gradual withdrawal over a course of several months; a slow down of the withdrawal was not officially confirmed by the administration at the time. In December 2018, US President Donald Trump announced that US troops involved in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS) in northeast Syria would be withdrawn imminently. Trump's surprise decision overturned Washington's policy in the Middle East. It fueled the ambitions and anxieties of local and regional actors vying over the future shape of Syria. Many experts proposed that President Trump could mitigate the damage of his withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Syria by using Special Activities Center. Many believe the president chose \\"to replace U.S. ground forces in Syria with personnel from the CIA's Special Activities Center\\" and that the process has been underway for months. Already experienced in operations in Syria, the CIA has numerous paramilitary officers who have the skills to operate independently in harms way. And while the CIA lacks the numbers to replace all 2,000 U.S. military personnel currently in Syria and work alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces (these CIA personnel are spread cross the world), but their model is based on fewer enablers and support. 2019 =January 2019= CJTF-OIR airstrike on an ISIL building in al-Shaafah, 4 January 2019 On 6 January 2019, U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton, while on a trip to Israel and Turkey, said that the pullout of U.S. troops from Syria depended on certain conditions, including the assurance that the remnants of ISIL forces are defeated and Kurds in northern Syria were safe from Turkish forces. However, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected the call to protect Kurdish troops, whom he regarded as terrorist groups. On 10 January, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. would withdraw its troops from Syria while continuing the battle against ISIL. He also stated that there would be no U.S. reconstruction aid for areas controlled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad until Iran and its \\"proxies\\" had left. On 11 January, Coalition spokesman Col. Sean Ryan confirmed the U.S. troop withdrawal process from Syria had begun. \\"Out of concern for operational security, we will not discuss specific timelines, locations or troops movements,\\" he said. The SOHR observed that the Coalition had started scaling down its presence at Rmeilan airfield in al-Hasakah. U.S. defense officials said it had begun the removal of equipment, but not yet troops, and that the total amount of U.S. soldiers in Syria may temporarily increase in order to provide security for the final pullout. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian welcomed what he believed was a slower, more effective withdrawal by the U.S. after pressure from its allies. On 15 January the Coalition released fresh numbers regarding their ongoing operations in both Syria and Iraq. Between 30 December 2018 and 6 January 2019, the Coalition conducted 575 air and artillery strikes against ISIL in Syria; the strikes destroyed 105 ISIL mortar and rocket artillery units, 50 IED manufacturing sites, 26 vehicles, 19 weapons caches, and two UAV systems. Between January 7‚Äì13, airstrikes in the MERV near the Iraqi border also killed around 200 militants including four senior commanders. On 29 January, with ISIL cornered in its final redoubt due to the Kurdish-led conquest against it in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan proclaimed at his first news conference as SecDef that the Coalition will liberate all of the Islamic State's remaining self-proclaimed caliphate in \\"two weeks\\". \\"I'd say 99.5 percent plus of‚Ä¶the ISIS-controlled territory has been returned to the Syrians. Within a couple of weeks it will be 100 percent,\\" Shanahan said. He added that the U.S. is still in the early stages of what he called a \\"deliberate, coordinated, disciplined withdrawal,\\" from Syria and that \\"very important dialogues going on in major capitals\\" about support to Syria once the U.S. leaves were ongoing. =February 2019: Battle of Baghuz= President Donald Trump reiterated his support for withdrawing American ground troops from both Syria and Afghanistan in a series of tweets on 1 February amid proliferating concerns among America's allies, politicians, analysts, and local activists over a feared power vacuum in Syria post-withdrawal. \\"I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan, the 'Endless Wars' of unlimited spending and death. During my campaign I said, very strongly, that these wars must finally end. We spend $50 Billion a year in Afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace after 18 long years,\\" Trump tweeted. The day prior, the U.S. Senate had issued a rebuke of the president cautioning against the \\"precipitous withdrawal\\" of military forces; furthermore the United States Intelligence Community contradicted the president on its perception of the global threat ISIL continued to pose during a Senate committee hearing. A draft Pentagon report emerged on 1 February warning that ISIL could regain territory in Syria within a year following a U.S. disengagement from Syria. On 5 February, CENTCOM commander General Joseph Votel noted during a Senate Armed Services Committee testimony that he had not been consulted prior to Trump's decision to withdraw American forces, reinforcing the notion that the U.S. withdrawal was ordered completely unilaterally from the White House without prior consultation with relevant military advisors and Defense Department personnel. On 6 February, President Trump, while at a summit of 79 foreign ministers and officials that assisted in the global coalition against ISIL, predicted a formal announcement of a final victory against ISIL as early as the following week. \\"Remnants - that's all they have, remnants - but remnants can be very dangerous,\\" Trump said in regards to ISIL. \\"Rest assured, we'll do what it takes to defeat every ounce and every last person within the ISIS madness\\". The Wall Street Journal, citing State Department officials, reported on 8 February that the U.S. pullout was expected to be complete by April, with the majority of ground troops expected to be already withdrawn by mid-March. A U.S. official confirmed to Reuters that the withdrawal included pulling troops from al-Tanf. An Operation Inherent Resolve summary on Coalition activity between 27 January and 9 February detailed air and artillery strikes conducted in Iraq and Syria. The Coalition conducted 176 strikes in Syria. Targets included: 146 ISIL tactical units, 131 supply routes, 53 fighting positions, 31 staging areas, 14 VBIEDs, 13 pieces of engineering equipment, 11 explosive belts, nine tankers for petroleum oil and lubricants, eight tactical vehicles, five command and control nodes, four buildings, three aircraft operations areas, three tunnels, two petroleum oil and lubricant storage facilities, two manufacturing facilities for IEDs, two artillery pieces, two weapons caches, and one armored vehicle. After the SDF's assault on Baghuz Fawqani began on 9 February, CENTCOM commander Joseph Votel told CNN on 11 February that ISIL losing physical territory does not mean the end of the organization. \\"Putting military pressure on [ISIL] is always better, it's always easier when you are there on the ground, but in this case our President has made a decision and we are going to execute that and so it's my responsibility as the CENTCOM commander working with my chain of command to look at how we do that,\\" adding that the completion of the U.S. pullout was \\"weeks away...but then again it will be driven by the situation on the ground\\". Trump tweeted late on 16 February urging European countries to repatriate the over 800 captured suspected ISIL members from Syria, warning the U.S. may be forced to release them otherwise. Kurdish prisons could not hold the ISIL members and all their families, totaling around 2,000 people, indefinitely. The Kurds called the situation a \\"time bomb\\". The U.S.-Kurdish demand to take responsibility got mixed responses from Europe. German foreign minister Heiko Maas said repatriation would be possible only if returning fighters could be immediately taken into custody, which would be \\"extremely difficult to achieve\\" without proper judicial information. France, whose citizens made up the majority of European ISIL recruits, said it would not act immediately on Trump's call but would take militants back \\"case by case,\\" and not categorically. Britain has said its fighters can return only if they seek consular help in Turkey, while acknowledging repatriation was a dilemma. Belgium‚Äôs justice minister Koen Geens called for a \\"European solution,\\" urging \\"calm reflection and a look at what would pose the least security risks.\\" The Hungarian foreign minister, P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥, said the issue was \\"one of the greatest challenges ahead of us for the upcoming months.\\" After announcing the U.S. would keep a \\"peacekeeping\\" force of around 200-400 troops in Syria ‚Äî instead of the initially planned total withdrawal ‚Äî on 22 February, senior Trump administration and defense officials stated the decision was an endorsement of a plan pressed by U.S. military leaders for some time, calling for an international force, preferably NATO or regional Arab allies, of 800 to 1,500 troops that would monitor a safe zone along Syria's border with Turkey. =March‚ÄìApril 2019= On 10 March, John Bolton stated that he was \\"optimistic\\" France and the UK would commit personnel to the planned observer force. He also reiterated the U.S. commitment to keep troops in Iraq. On 20 March, in response to new developments in the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, President Trump predicted that the remaining ISIL holdout would be cleared \\"by tonight\\" during a speech at the Lima Army Tank Plant in Lima, Ohio. \\"The caliphate is gone as of tonight,\\" he said, as he used maps depicting ISIL's territorial collapse since November 2016; later, the November 2016 map was shown to actually be a map from 2014 when ISIL was at its peak territorial size, before the Coalition's anti-ISIL operations. On 23 March, the U.S.-backed SDF announced victory in the battle of Baghuz, signifying the territorial collapse of ISIL in Syria, a critical milestone for the U.S.-led Syrian intervention. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy stated that the physical caliphate was defeated but ISIL was not and that there were over 10,000 completely unrepentant fighters left in Syria and Iraq. He expected the U.S. to be in Syria for the long haul with a very capable partner in the Syrian Democratic Forces. He said that the U.S. partnership with the SDF was a model to follow, like the partnership with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban and with the Kurdish Peshmerga in Iraq as the northern front against Saddam Hussein. U.S.-Turkish negotiations over joint troop patrols in a designated safe zone along the northern Turkish-Syrian border continued into late April as the UK and France rejected a plan to provide troops to a buffer zone between Rojava and Turkey, claiming their missions in Syria are only to fight ISIL. With their troop numbers set to be cut to 1,000 in upcoming months, the U.S. reportedly prefers a narrower strip of land to patrol than the approximately 20 miles that Turkey has proposed. The Turks would send their own troops into the buffer zone while only demanding U.S. logistical help and air cover. The Turkish proposal reportedly saw push back as the Americans prefer to avoid a situation that effectively pushes the Turkish border 20 miles into Syria, further increasing the chances of clashes with the Kurds instead of reducing it. =May 2019= The Syria Study Group, a U.S. Congressionally-appointed panel of experts tasked with assessing the situation in Syria, similar to the Iraq Study Group appointed in 2006, released an interim report on 1 May endorsing the view that instead of a draw down, the U.S. should reassert its presence in Syria, citing the prospect of a potential ISIL resurgence, Russian \\"prestige\\" after successfully propping up the Assad government, perceived Iranian entrenchment in the country, and al-Qaeda retaining control in the form of Hayat Tahrir al- Sham's dominance in northwestern Syria, a region U.S. warplanes rarely venture to due to the nearby presence of Russian air defenses deployed on behalf of the Syrian government. The report argued that the U.S. should step up attempts to isolate Assad and counter Iranian influence in the region; it also argued that the U.S. should take in more Syrian refugees, the admittance of which the Trump administration has reduced from thousands to just a few dozen in recent years. The report further underlined the differing views between the president and comparatively more hawkish Congress on what direction to take the U.S.'s commitments in the country. =June‚ÄìJuly 2019= AH-64 Apache on an escort mission in northeastern Syria, 22 June 2019 On 30 June 2019, in a rare operation against non-ISIL elements, the U.S. carried out a strike against an al-Qaeda in Syria (AQ-S) leadership meeting at a training facility west of Aleppo, which killed eight jihadists from the Guardians of Religion Organization, including six commanders: two Tunisians, two Algerians, an Egyptian and a Syrian. It was the first known coalition strike in western Syria since February 2017 due to the U.S. and Russia arranging an unofficial deconfliction boundary that largely bars any substantial U.S. forces from venturing into the region. The U.S. did not specify what assets were used in the strike. In July, U.S. special anti-ISIL envoy James Jeffrey continued to urge Britain, France and Germany to assist the U.S.'s ground mission in Syria. \\"We want ground troops from Germany to partly replace our soldiers\\" in the area as part of the anti-Islamic State coalition, Jeffrey told German media. During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Deputy Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Michael Mulroy stated that the SDF has over 2,000 foreign terrorist fighters in custody from over 50 countries‚Äîin which they spend quite a bit of time, effort and resources taking care of‚Äîand that the U.S. has pushed these countries to take back their citizens. The number of American nationals who joined ISIL on the battlefield is small compared to countries like France and the UK, where several hundred foreign fighters traveled from. =August 2019= On 7 August 2019, the U.S. and Turkey reached a framework deal to jointly implement a demilitarized buffer zone in the areas between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers‚Äîexcluding the Manbij area‚Äîin northern Syria. Terms of the deal include joint U.S.-Turkish ground patrols, the relocation of some Syrian refugees into the area, and the withdrawal of heavily armed YPG and YPJ forces and fortifications from the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border, leaving the areas under SDF military council rule instead. On 24 August, the SDF began dismantling border fortifications under the supervision of U.S. forces. On 27 August, YPG units began withdrawing from Tell Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. On 31 August, in a second attack against non-ISIL militants in western Syria since June 30, the U.S. carried out a series of airstrikes on a Rouse the Believers Operations Room meeting between Kafriya and Maarrat Misrin, killing over 40 Guardians of Religion militants, including several leaders. Local human rights NGOs reported that 29 civilians were killed in the attack, naming 22, of whom six were children.https://airwars.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/02/2019-Annual-Report-Web.pdf =October 2019: U.S. withdrawal from north Syria, return, & al-Baghdadi's death= Following a phone call between U.S. President Trump and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the White House released a statement on 6 October that Turkey would \\"soon\\" be carrying out a planned military offensive into Kurdish-administered northern Syria, so U.S. troops in northern Syria began to withdraw from the area to avoid interference with the offensive. The White House statement also passed responsibility for the area's captured ISIL fighters (held by Kurdish forces) to Turkey. This initial withdrawal involved around 50 troops from two towns along the Syrian border, Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. The sudden withdrawal proved controversial as U.S. Congress members of both parties sharply denounced the move, including Republican allies of Trump such as Senator Lindsey Graham and Mitch Mcconnell. They argued that the move betrayed the American-allied Kurds, and would only benefit ISIL, Turkey, Russia, Iran and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime. After the U.S. pullout, Turkey launched its ground offensive into Kurdish-controlled areas in northeast Syria on 9 October, spelling the collapse of the Turkey‚ÄìU.S. Northern Syria Buffer Zone agreement established in August 2019. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied that the U.S. had given a \\"green light\\" for Turkey to attack the Kurds. However, Pompeo defended the Turkish military action, stating that Turkey had a \\"legitimate security concern\\" with \\"a terrorist threat to their south\\". On 13 October, Defense Secretary Mark Esper stated that the entire contingent of nearly 1,000 U.S. troops would be withdrawn from northern Syria entirely, because the U.S. learned that Turkey will \\"likely intend to extend their attack further south than originally planned, and to the west\\". Hours later, the Kurdish forces, concluding that it would help save Kurdish lives, announced an alliance with the Syrian government and its Russian allies, in a united effort to repel the Turkish offensive. On 25 October, Mark Esper confirmed the U.S. had partially reversed its Syria pullout and that the U.S. had a new dedicated mission to guard and secure Syrian oil and gas fields and infrastructure, assisted by the deployment of mechanized infantry units. Though the deployment of mechanized units shifted the U.S.'s special forces- led Syria intervention to a more conventional military operation, therefore leaving a heavier U.S. footprint in Syria, Esper stressed that the U.S.'s \\"core mission\\" in Syria continued to be defeating ISIL. Death of al- Baghdadi A U.S. drone view of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's hideout in Barisha, Idlib before the U.S. special forces raid, 26 October 2019 On 26 October 2019, U.S. Joint Special Operations Command's (JSOC) 1st SFOD-D (Delta Force) conducted a high-profile raid into Idlib Governorate near the border with Turkey that resulted in the death of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. =November 2019= Observers raised concerns about the potential for deliberate or inadvertent altercations in north and east Syria, as U.S. forces were now operating in close proximity to Russian, Syrian, and Turkish-backed forces in accordance with an 22 October Russian-Turkish \\"safe zone\\" arrangement and a prior SDF-Syrian government deal. By November, there had been a steady flow of pictures and videos online showing U.S., Syrian, and Russian forces passing by each other in northern Syria. On 3 November, a U.S. convoy came within one kilometer of a Turkish-backed rebel artillery strike near Tell Tamer, with no U.S. personnel injured. On 7 November, the Pentagon reiterated that the U.S.'s only mission in Syria is to \\"defeat ISIS\\", and that securing Syrian oil fields is \\"a subordinate task to that mission\\" by denying ISIL any potential oil revenue. Though ISIL's territory and physical caliphate had been decimated, \\"We've not said that ISIS as an ideology and ISIS as an insurgency has been eliminated,\\" a Pentagon spokesman stated. The Pentagon also insisted that the revenue from the Syrian oil fields the U.S. is protecting will go to the SDF, not the U.S., despite President Trump raising the possibility in late October of American oil companies taking over the oilfields. On 19 November, a report by the Pentagon Inspector General, citing Defense Intelligence Agency assessments, starkly concluded that the U.S. pullout from most of northern Syria on 6 October and the subsequent 9 October Turkish ground offensive gave ISIL the \\"time and space\\" to regroup as a potent transnational terror threat. The report assessed that Turkey's incursion impacted the U.S.'s relationship with the Syrian Kurds, greatly shifted the balance of power in north Syria, and disrupted CJTF-OIR and SDF counter- terrorism operations to the point of giving ISIL ample room to quickly resurge. The report, like the Syria Study Group's May 2019 report, further underscored the differing attitudes of the Trump White House and the intelligence community on the state of the intervention. On 10 November, in regards to U.S. troop levels in Syria, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley stated that there will be fewer than 1,000 troops remaining \\"for sure\\" and estimated that number would be around 500 to 600; Defense Secretary Mark Esper echoed the 600 estimate three days later, adding that numbers could fluctuate depending on the situation on the ground and the possible increase of European presence in the country. On 23 November, General Kenneth McKenzie, USCENTCOM commander, stated that there were \\"about 500 U.S. personnel generally east of the Euphrates river east of Deir al Zor up to Hasaka\\" that were working closely with the SDF and were set to reconvene anti-ISIL operations in coming days and weeks. SDF-U.S. counterinsurgency coordination reportedly recommenced that same day. =December 2019= U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley testify to Congress about the Syria intervention, 11 December 2019 On 4 December, Mark Esper told Reuters that the U.S. had scaled down its presence in northeast Syria and consolidated its forces in the country to a flexible 600 troops, a 40 percent reduction in troop levels since Donald Trump's initial October order to withdraw 1,000; it was not clear if the 600 estimate included the ~200-250 troops at al-Tanf, which would raise the actual total estimate to around 800‚Äì850. Esper again suggested that U.S. troop numbers could further decline if more NATO allies volunteered personnel. Local sources reported that a team of 15 Egyptian and Saudi engineers and technicians arrived at the al-Omar oil field in Deir ez-Zor on 13 December, reportedly tasked by the U.S. with enhancing oil production at the field and training locals to observe oil productivity in the area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Russian and U.S. soldiers got into a \\"brawl\\" in Tell Tamer on 25 December, where a spontaneous meeting between Russian and American troops devolved into a fist fight, \\"due to their presence in the same area\\"; no one was reportedly hurt as the incident did not involve weapons. The U.S. troops were reportedly in the area with an interpreter to get to know the opinions of local residents. The Russian Ministry of Defense denied the claims, calling the SOHR report a \\"hoax\\".  2020  =January 2020= During Russian President Vladimir Putin visit to the Mariamite Cathedral of Damascus on 7 January 2020, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad mentioned in a video aired on Russia-1, the legend of Paul the Apostle who became a Christian at the gate of Damascus, and added jokingly: \\"If Trump arrives along this road, everything will become normal with him too\\", Putin later told Al-Assad to invite Trump to Damascus, while Al-Assad replied: \\"I am ready\\", then Putin said that he would convey the invitation. On 18 January, U.S. troops blocked a Russian convoy from entering Rmelan, where the U.S. is protecting oil fields under SDF control. Tension occurred between the two groups as U.S. soldiers asked the Russian soldiers to return to the Amuda district in northwest of Al-Hasakah Governorate. Tensions between Russian and American forces continued to grow as U.S. troops again blocked a Russian convoy from using a main road between two Kurdish-held towns on 21 January. On 23 January, in regards to ISIL activity in Iraq and northeastern Syria, ambassador James Jeffrey stated there was no uptick in violence following the U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January that killed an Iranian general.

She is an associate professor of statistics at the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus in the Department of Applied Mathematics. In 2018, Ho received the L'Or√©al-UNESCO International Rising Talent Award in recognition of her work toward developing a predictive model estimating the risk of breast cancer for Southeast Asian women.  Education  Ho attended Northumbria University from 2002 to 2005 and graduated with a Bachelor of Science with Honours (BSc(Hons)) degree in Mathematics. In 2005, she began her graduate studies in mathematics at Newcastle University. Ho's early interest in mathematics eventually inspired her to study statistics. Her doctoral advisor, biostatistician Robin Henderson, introduced her to the potential applications of mathematics and statistics in answering scientific questions. Ho conducted research on how to approach and account for incomplete data in longitudinal and survival studies. She completed her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 2009.  Career and research  Ho's first postdoctoral research experience was at the National Institute for Health Research, where she applied advanced mathematic methodology to child speech and development studies and trained health professionals in the use of statistical methods. In 2010, Ho returned to Newcastle University to conduct postdoctoral research in its School of Mathematics and Statistics. From January 2011 to April 2013, Ho worked as a medical and genetic statistician at the University of Cambridge Department of Public Health and Primary Care. = Predicting breast cancer risk = In May 2013, Ho left the United Kingdom and returned to Malaysia. A month later, in June 2013, she joined the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus as an assistant professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and was promoted to associate professor in 2017. Rather than the rare mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2, the relatively common and more subtle variations associated with breast cancer are of greater interest to Ho. While having only one of these variations typically results in little to no effect on an individual's health, inheriting a combination of these variations could be detrimental for breast cancer risk. Thus, the goal of Ho's current research is to determine which combination of variations associated with breast cancer risk will result in the greatest predicted breast cancer risk. Ho's research utilizes research led by her friend and colleague Teo Soo Hwang, the CEO of Cancer Research Malaysia, the largest breast cancer study in Malaysia. The motivation behind Ho's research is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of breast cancer screening in Malaysia, where the number of breast cancer cases are expected to increase by 50% in the next decade. By identifying women with a greater risk of developing breast cancer, Ho hopes to establish a more personalized, patient-centered breast cancer screening program. She was awarded the L'Or√©al- UNESCO Malaysia For Women in Science Fellowship for her work in 2017, and named a L'Or√©al-UNESCO International Rising Talent in 2018.

Early life  Mahomet was the son of Afghan Cameleer Gool Mahomet and his wife, French former prostitute, Desiree Ernestine Adrienne Lesire who, following her marriage and conversion to Islam changed her name to Miriam Bebe. He was the couples first child, born at Coolgardie, Western Australia on 16 September 1911, and his family moved around Australia for much of his childhood and early adulthood.  Career  In 1931 Mahomet stopped travelling as much as he had when his father leased, and later purchased, Mulgaria Station in South Australia and he worked there for many years; taking over the management of it following his fathers death in 1950. In 1947 Mahomet married Australian woman Iris in two ceremonies; first a Muslim-Afghan ritual at the Adelaide Mosque (where he was Mullah) and then, on the same day, a christian ceremony. Mahomet had an active Muslim faith for all of his life and, for many years he and his father Gool paid the rates and taxes for the impoverished Adelaide Mosque. In 1962 Mahomet sold the station and moved to Alice Springs in 1963, where he established the 'Mahomet Trucking Company' with his three sons. It was said that \\"trucks were the new camels\\" and Mahomet and his sons began freighting between Alice Springs and Adelaide and Alice Springs and Darwin. In Alice Springs Mahomet became a leader of the Islamic community in Alice Springs: a community made up primarily of descendants of the Afghan Cameleers. In 1975, following an unexpected phone call, Mahomet was asked to represent the Australian Government, then led by Gough Whitlam, on a trip to Saudi Arabia where he would present King Faisal with camels. Whitlam hoped that this gift would link these two countries in a 'cultural cousinship' and that this wealthy Arab nation would loan Australia money. Just before Mahomet's arrival in Saudi Arabia King Faisal was assassinated and had been replaced by King Khalid. On this trip Mahomet was able to make his first visit to Mecca. On his return from this trip Mahomet sold his trucking company and established the Alice Springs Camel Farm as camels were becoming a popular tourist attraction in Alice Springs. At this farm he would catch and break-in feral camels, make saddles and harnesses and teach camel-handling. One of his students was Robyn Davidson who intended (and succeeded) in completed a solo overland journey with camels across the Gibson Desert and to the Indian Ocean. Mahomet trained Davidson for more than a year and provided her with two of the camels (Kate and Zeleika) that would accompany her on the journey. During this journey Davidson said that she would often recall Mahomet's advice and warnings; especially when faced with the ferocity of in season wild camels eyeing her herd.  Death  Mahomet died on 17 July 1983, at the age of 72, at the Old Timers Home in Alice Springs. Following his death cards and telegrams of bereavement and sympathy arrived from all over the Muslim world. His name is displayed on the Cameleers Memorial in Alice Springs.

Since 2014 it has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The Sound of Barra is composed of 98.91% marine and inlet areas, 1.07% mudflats and other semi-submerged areas and 0.02% sea cliffs and islets. There are ten islands in the sound, with only Eriskay still being inhabited: * Calvay * Eriskay * Fiaraidh * Flodday * Fuday * Fuiay * Gighay * Hellisay * lingay * Orosay There is a ferry service across the sound from Ardmore () on Barra to Ceann a' Gh√†raidh on the island of Eriskay. In 2000 it was proposed that the Sound of Barra should become a SAC. A 12-week consultation process was undertaken by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) on behalf of the Scottish Government in the autumn of 2011 with two public meetings held in Castlebay on Barra and on Eriskay as well as inviting submissions by letter and e-mail. SAC status was confirmed on 3 December 2014. The primary reasons for its status as a SAC are the benefits to marine conservation of its sandbanks and reefs with their diverse flora and including maerl and other red algae, kelp communities and fauna such as barnacles and mussels and the presence of harbour seals also being a qualifying feature.

Early life He was born in Kojonup in Western Australia to Terrence and Mary Moir who were farmers and had three siblings, Margaret, Andrew and Catherine. He said he only learnt to read and write at age twelve but became an avid reader of all things scientific. Education On completion of high school, he studied biochemistry at the University of Western Australia with one of his microbiology lecturers being Nobel Prize winner Dr Barry Marshall, who discovered that H. pylori cause ulcers. He received his PHD in 1996 from the University of Melbourne, supervised by neuropathologist Dr Colin L. Masters. Career Moir immigrated to the United States in 1994 to work in Dr Rudolph Tanzi's laboratory at Harvard University as an Alzheimer‚Äôs biochemist. He had met Tanzi at a medical conference in Amsterdam. Moir was also able to purify and produce quantities of the molecule which the brain used to make the beta- amyloid. He concentrated initially in Tanzi's work on establishing what genes affected the risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. He continued working for Tanzi as a post-doctoral fellow and would eventually become an assistant professor in neurology at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital and his own laboratory at the institution. In 2007 he came across a research article about an antimicrobial peptide called LL37 that killed viruses, fungi and bacteria in the brain and which he thought could be a twin of the beta- amyloid, another antimicrobial. Tanzi's work at the time focused on genes that increased the risk of getting Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and the inbuilt ability of some to fight germs so Moir proposed that beta-amyloid might have an anti- microbial effect in Alzheimer's. The theory was that the beta-amyloid creates a plaque that captures the dangerous microbes and protects the brain but too much build-up of the plaque could become toxic and cause Alzheimer‚Äôs disease to develop. Tanzi encouraged Moir to continue research into the use of beta- amyloids to kill pathogens, funding it out of the former's research funding. He succeeded in this theory 2009 when he finally replicated the process in laboratory petrie dishes. The next step was to try the theory in Alzheimer and healthy brain tissue with good results and attempted to publish the results in Science and three other journals and was rejected but finally succeeded in 2010. In 2010 funding was given to fund himself, a doctoral student and $400 worth of mice. Testing proved the theory in live Alzheimer's mice and he then attempted to publish in six journals in 2014 but was rejected by peers. The paper would eventually be published in 2016 by the journal Science Translational Medicine. When the research article was published in 2016, it was regarded as one of the top five advances in Neurology for that year. In 2016, he attempted to gain funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to research whether herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), which causes cold sores and can reach the brain, that might promote both amyloid plaques and tau tangles but was rejected when the third funding reviewer criticized the proposed research as being a possible minor cause of Alzheimer's, Moir's lack of being a full professor and poor previous funding. He would later be funded by CureAlz and again attempted to publish in 2017 before finally being published in 2018. Moir struggled for many years to obtain funding for his research, like many in his field, as those reviewing funding applications and those vetting papers for possible publication, viewed alternative explanations for the cause of Alzheimer's Disease as wrong. In 2006 he received funding from the NIH/National Institute on Aging (NIA) for targeting cross-linked amyloid protein species as a therapy for Alzheimer's Disease. In 2010 further funding from NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) for the study of the Abeta protein of Alzheimer's Disease is an antimicrobial peptide and in 2019, again from the NIH/NIA for research into the Antimicrobial activities of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease brain. Attempting another request for a grant from the NIH in 2018 for further research into the herpes virus and Alzheimer's was rejected before money was found in early 2019. At the time of his death, he was still an Assistant Professor of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital. The Moir Lab focused on the biochemical and cellular mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and ageing. Marriage Moir was married twice. First to Elena Vaillancourt from whom he divorced in 2004, and secondly to Julie Alperen. Death Moir died in a hospice in Milton, Massachusetts from the effects of glioblastoma. Rob had three children; Alexander Moir, with his first wife Elena Vaillancourt, and Maxwell and Holly with his wife, Julie Alperen .

After the battle against the Greeks he was taken prisoner but was freed by Leone, who admired his bravery. Owing Leone his life, he is honour-bound to support his bid for Leone's hand. Leone asks Ruggiero, whom he still thinks is Erminio, whether it is true that Bradamante is in love with Ruggiero. Ruggiero confirms this is true. He secretly suffers from the conflict between his friendship with Leone and his love for Bradamante. The imperial apartment Bradamante asks Carlo Magno for help.

The opera concludes with Emperor Carlo blessing the union of the two couples, Ruggiero and Bradamante, Clotilde and Leone. Background Metastasio by Batoni Johann Adolph Hasse by Balthasar Denner Metastasio had previously written a first version of the libretto at the request of Empress Maria Theresa for the marriage of Marie Antoinette with the future Louis XVI on May 16, 1770. It was this wedding which inspired the theme of the opera, with its setting in Paris and its focus on courtly love. Metastasio did not feel able to discharge this commission well, and only reluctantly agreed to do so out of a sense of duty to the empress. After a while he stopped working on the text and the court had to abandon the planned performance. Nevertheless, Maria Theresa insisted that he complete the libretto. The following year, at the wedding of her son Ferdinand to Maria Beatrice d'Este, she ordered Metastasio to revise it for performance on October 16, 1771 in Milan. Her favorite composer Hasse, who had been associated with the imperial court for over thirty years, was commissioned to compose the music. Hasse was 71 years old and plagued by gout, so was hardly able to write. He had also abandoned writing theatre music three years before, to devote the rest of his life to church music. He was aware that musical tastes had changed and that his style was no longer what people wanted to hear. Nevertheless, he accepted the commission. Critical reception Metastasio's libretto did not prove a success. The subject of knightly combat was not in keeping with the taste of the time and the plot seemed somewhat old-fashioned with its similarities to his earlier libretti L'Olimpiade and Nitteti. Hasse's setting relied on extensive recitatives, which may not have helped, and his use of an expanded wind section and timpani to create a festive quality in the music was to no avail. Both for Metastasio and for Hasse Ruggiero was a disappointing end to their life's work. As part of the extensive wedding celebrations, Mozart's pastoral opera Ascanio in Alba was also being performed. The main roles in both works were taken by the soprano Antonia Maria Girelli Aguilar, the castrato Giovanni Manzuoli and the tenor Giuseppe Tibaldi. They were all among the greatest vocal virtuosi of their time, but were past their best. The stage sets were created by the brothers Bernardino, Fabrizio and Giovanni Antonio Galliari. Due to illness of Girelli, the opera was stopped after the fourth performance. The world premiere of Mozart's took place the day after the premiere of Il Ruggiero, on October 17, 1771, and it was a great success. Hasse is said to have remarked: \\"Questo ragazzo ci far√† dimenticar tutti\\" (\\"This boy will make us all forgotten.\\") The authenticity of this saying is questioned, but it is certain that Hasse admitted the failure of his opera, as can be seen from a letter dated October 30: \\"Il mio Ruggiero ebbe la prima sera tutte quelle fatalit√† che possono unirvi per far torto ad una produzione teatrale.\\" (On its first night, my Ruggiero suffered every misfortune that could combine to make a theater production fail.) After this failure Maria Theresa was kind to Hasse. In December she invited him to an audience with his daughter and gave him a generous gift. On January 20, 1772, there was a follow-up performance at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, for which Hasse slightly revised the score. The main difference was that the final scene was replaced by a ballet. Other settings The only other settings of Metastasio's libretto were by Antonio Gandini in 1820 and a version produced in Naples in 1838 with music by Samuel Holmes.

He was a patron to Frits Van den Berghe, Gustave De Smet and Ren√© Magritte, among others.  Biography  His father was a potato merchant and grocer. After his father's death, in 1897, Paul Verbauwen (1844-1926), one of the leaders of the Ghent Worker's Party, became his guardian. He began his primary education in an industrial school. When he was sixteen, he became friends with Hendrik de Man and they created a Socialist study circle together. In 1905, he became co-founder and secretary of the and published his first writings. Not long after, he suddenly renounced politics and opted for a career as a writer. He also worked as an actor. By 1907, together with and Octaaf Steghers (1889-1942), among others, he had created a literary magazine called Nieuw Leven. A frequent theme of his articles there involved what he felt was the miserable state of the theaters in Flanders. By 1909, this had led to the foundation of the Flemish Association for Theater and Performing Arts, with as its Artistic Director and Van Hecke as its Secretary. During this time, he settled in Sint-Martens- Latem, the site of an influential art colony. There, he became a sort of \\"spiritual director\\" for the artists who made up the Latem School of painting. Gustave De Smet, Frits Van den Berghe and Constant Permeke became his lifelong friends. P.G. van Hecke and Norine; by L√©on Spilliaert (1920) Throughout his career, he lost enthusiasm for projects when any conflicts developed. As a result, he abandoned Nieuw Leven in favor of the new cosmopolitan magazine De Boomgaard (The Orchard), where he wanted to re-establish the tradition of the pioneering Van Nu en Straks (Of Now and Later). In addition to himself, the editors there included Pieter Nicolaas van Eyck and Paul Kenis, among others. He then became interested in pursuing a journalistic career and moved to Antwerp to work on the De Nieuwe Gazet and the French-language magazine, La M√©tropole. There, he met Maria Barbery, who would become his first wife in 1912. The marriage became troubled almost immediately, but they were not officially divorced until 1921. He created another literary magazine in 1913, De Tijd (The Times) but, due to a combination of his losing interest and the beginning of World War I, it was short-lived. Shortly after the war began, he moved to Brussels, became involved in the Flemish Movement, and worked as a reporter for De Vlaamsche Post, a paper with German financial connections. In 1915, together with and , he took over the . This lasted only a short time when , to the dismay of his friends, he became Director of a small French theater called \\"La Bonbonni√®re\\". This also lasted for only a few months, until he met Honorine Deschrijver (known as \\"Norine\\") and they opened a couturier's shop together. For the first time, he was making a considerable amount of money, which resulted in the establishment of a publishing house, three magazines and an art gallery. =Post-war enterprises= The publishing house, established in 1920, was Het Roode Zeil (The Red Sail). Its first publication was a collection of poems by Karel van de Woestijne. Other notable publications included the surrealist novel, M√©lusine, by Franz Hellens and La Lumi√®re, a play by Georges Duhamel. An accompanying magazine was cancelled after nine issues, due to unprofitability. The gallery, S√©lection, was also established in 1920 and won the immediate support of his old friends from editing days. It closed two years later, but an associated magazine continued, sporadically, until 1933. A third magazine, Signaux de France et de Belgique, lasted for barely one year. P.G. van Hecke and Norine; by Frits Van den Berghe (1923) In 1928, he opened another art gallery in Brussels; L‚Äô√âpoque. Shortly after, another magazine, the monthly Vari√©t√©s, began publication. It was a richly illustrated magazine that catered to popular tastes and current styles; although it included works by such noted artists as James Ensor, Wassily Kandinsky, Giorgio de Chirico and Max Ernst, as well as Van Hecke's friends. At this time, he also developed an interest in Surrealism, which led him to provide support for Ren√© Magritte, Paul Delvaux and, years later, Marcel Mari√´n. The 1930s depression brought an end to many of these enterprises and he was forced to sell off his private collection to save Le Couturier Norine. In 1931, he already started working as a journalist again, for the Socialist newspaper, ' (Forward), where he created a \\"Spiritual Life\\" section. During World War II, he and the other editors fled to France. They returned after Belgium's capitulation to find the paper in German hands. During the remainder of the war, he supplemented his couturier's income by becoming an art dealer. In 1943, he joined with Ang√®le Manteau to set up and manage the French language division of her publishing house, √âditions Lumi√®re. He also edited her weekly magazine, Zondagspost and, in 1944, combined that with an editorial position at the French Socialist newspaper, Le Peuple. Most of this activity had ceased within two years of the war's end. During his tenure at Voorhuit, he had written some film criticism so, in 1947, his interests turned in that direction. That same year, in June, he organized the first \\"Mondial du Film et des Beaux-arts\\" festival in Brussels. The festival's second edition took place in Knokke in 1949, in conjunction with a modern art exhibit at the local casino. In 1950, he became Director-General of the Soci√©t√© des Cin√©mas Path√© and managed several movie theaters in Brussels, including the . For the next decade, he was largely involved with the festivals and exhibitions in Knokke. As the 1960s began, his health problems increased and he often considered withdrawing from public life. He died in 1967, at his home in Ixelles. Norine died ten years later. They had no children.

The Temple is part of The Enchantments, set within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. The Temple belongs to the Stuart Range which is a subset of the Cascade Range. The nearest higher peak is Enchantment Peak, to the west, and the nearest town is Leavenworth, to the northeast. The mountain hosts many granite spires with names like The High Priest, The Boxtop, Flake Tower, Comet Spire, Razorback Spire, The Meteor, The Professor, Lighthouse Tower, Black Pyramid, and the most recognizable Prusik Peak. The highest point of the mountain is called Mt. Temple. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Snow Creek which is a tributary of Icicle Creek. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

A note was found in the eye socket of the skull: > Skull of Havildar \\"Alum Bheg,\\" 46th Regt. Bengal N. Infantry who was blown > away from a gun, amongst several others of his Regt. He was a principal > leader in the mutiny of 1857 & of a most ruffianly disposition. He took > possession (at the head of a small party) of the road leading to the fort, > to which place all the Europeans were hurrying for safety. His party > surprised and killed Dr. Graham shooting him in his buggy by the side of his > daughter. His next victim was the Rev. Mr. Hunter, a missionary, who was > flying with his wife and daughters in the same direction. He murdered Mr > Hunter, and his wife and daughters after being brutally treated were > butchered by the road side. Alum Bheg was about 32 years of age; 5 feet 7 ¬Ω > inches high and by no means an ill looking native. The skull was brought > home by Captain (AR) Costello (late Capt. 7th Drag. Guards), who was on duty > when Alum Bheg was executed. The pub's owners had felt uneasy keeping the skull and sought the expertise of Wagner after hearing about his research on the British Empire. Wagner later reported \\"and so it was I found myself standing in a small train station in Essex with a human skull in my bag. Not just any other skull but one directly related to a part of history that I write about and that I teach my students every year\\". The Natural History Museum confirmed its likely authenticity and Wagner, with little evidence to go by, traced Bheg's history using letters written by the relatives and friends of Bheg's alleged victims. Wagner confirmed that Alum Bheg was present at the rebellion at Sialkot, British India, in July 1857, an event about which little has been written. The absence of Alum Bheg from historical records led Wagner to narrate an account of thousands of Indian soldiers like Bheg, who revolted in 1857. However, he says \\"truth is that the outbreak at Sialkot was a highly contingent and confused event, and one that in many ways differed from places [such as] Meerut, Delhi and elsewhere. At Sialkot there was ‚Ä¶ no lynching of isolated sahibs, no sexual attack on memsahibs and no mutilation of their corpses. Though many opportunities presented [themselves], sepoys did not take part in any such thing\\". The book includes a chapter on the colonial method of blowing from a cannon, a form of punishment designed to shatter bodies, making traditional funeral rites impossible for both Hindus and Muslims. There is also a chapter on the collection of skulls from other colonies. Wagner reported that his \\"research revealed several surprising discoveries, not least of which was that Alum Bheg was most likely innocent of the crimes for which he was executed\\". The book concludes with Wagner's wish for the skull to be repatriated back to India to be \\"buried in a respectful manner\\", preferably near the Ravi River, where Bheg was known to have been involved in the Battle of Trimmu Ghat. Reception Shaun Doherty of the Socialist Review described the book as \\"meticulously researched\\" and \\"well-documented\\" with a \\"gripping narrative that brings to life the human aspects of imperial domination\\". Historian Yasmin Khan reported that it \\"reads like a detective novel and yet is also an important contribution to understanding British rule and the extent of colonial violence\\".

The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Mixed traffic (M) engine, 2nd (2). A total of 38 WAM-2/3 locomotives were built by The Japanese Group (a consortium of Mitsubishi, Hitachi and Toshiba) between 1960 and 1964. They entered service in 1960. The WAM-2 served both passenger and freight trains for over 40 years. As of January 2020, All locomotives have been removed from service all were sadly scrapped. History These locomotives were built by a consortium of Mitsubishi, Hitachi and Toshiba (The Japanese Group, as attested by a plaque fixed on their sides) as a second option to the Europeans WAM-1. They were delivered in 1960 and were a bit lower powered than the WAM1 but had similar Bo-Bo wheel arrangement (4 wheels per bogie) with four Mitsubishi DC traction motors connected to the wheels permanently in parallel through a WN geared drive. The WAM2 had Ignitron rectifiers just like the WAM1 but some were later were refitted with Excitron rectifiers. Some even had the Mitsubishi logo painted on their sides. 38 of these were produced in two batches with the initial batch of 10 locos having air brakes for the loco and vacuum train brakes, and the second batch of 26 having only vacuum brakes. These have not been retrofitted with air train brakes. Like the WAM1 they were also used around the ER-SER-NER-NR circuit as it was the first AC electrified area and hauled ordinary passenger trains and freights only and sometimes ran all the way to New Delhi via Kanpur. They were also used double-headed for freight trains. They had Four traction motors permanently coupled in parallel are fed by ignitron rectifiers. Speed control is by a tap changer on the input transformer. Mitsubishi transformer, 20 taps. Oerlikon exhauster and compressor, Arno rotary converter. They were homed at Asansol Loco Shed of Eastern Railways. On February 1980, the WAM-2/3 classes got there speed upgraded from 100 Km/h to 120 Km/h by RDSO. This was done for haulage of the Howrah Rajdhani between Howrah and Ghazibad on the Eastern and Northern railway division respectively. When the Sealdah suburban system was electrified under AC, there was a shortage of AC EMU's and so on an interim basis some WAM-2 units were used on push pull rake with WAM2 in the middle was used as EMUs before supplies were received and ER also retrofitted DC EMU stock, though the latter largely operated in HWH division which required dual voltage capability. Circulars at that time said condemnation of over aged E locos should be done because the locos have achieved their codal life of 35 years. Since they had less than five years of codal life left, all WAM-2/3 locos were Vacuum Brake stock were never considered for up-gradation to Air Brake / Dual Brake . The lifespan of certain WAM-2/3 locos could certainly be extended another five years of revenue service since they were in great condition . Instead, orders were in place to rapidly decommission these locos. It happened in such a hurry that not a single WAM-2/WAM-3 locos could be preserved or plinthed in process  Sub Classes  = WAM-3 = The WAM3 class consisted of two modified WAM2 locomotives, #20333 and #20337 of the Asansol ASN shed of Eastern Railway. They were rebuilt with their Pantographs aligned the other way around (pointing outwards) and fitted with silicon diode rectifiers as permanent feature thereby increasing their performance and durability, but were identical to the WAM2 in every other respect. These two were used to haul (then) prestigious trains like the Kalka Mail and Toofan Express to Delhi, but were later relegated to passenger duties and shunting as WAM4s became common.

She collaborated and performed with Franz Liszt. After many successful appearances across Europe, she married a Weimar lawyer in 1888 and stopped performing. In 1900, she committed suicide. Biography Born in Williamson, New York, on 6 June 1864, Anna Loretta Harkness was introduced to the violin by her mother. When she was nine, she went to Europe where she studied under Arno Hilf in Leipzig and Henryk Wieniawski in Brussels. In 1875 she entered the Paris Conservatoire to study under Joseph Lambert Massart. She received a Guadagini violin inscribed with her name as the Conservoire's first prize in 1881 when she was just 17. Thereafter she toured throughout Europe, performing at London's Crystal Palace in 1882, in Leipzig in 1883 and in Berlin in 1884. It was around this time that on the advice of her agent she changed her name to Senkrah (Harkness written backwards). In 1885, she performed with Franz Liszt and associated with his pupils. When in Russia in 1886, she met Tchaikovsky. On 3 September 1900, after two years of marriage to a Weimar lawyer by the name of Hoffmann, she shot herself with a revolver, possibly as a result of a brain disorder.

Plot In the slums of Kampala, Uganda, a young girl runs away from home and ends up in a child trafficking ring led by a former Uganda People's Defence Force commando. One day, while collecting metal scraps, she is viciously assaulted by multi-millionaire Hirigi when she mistakenly takes the tire iron of his van. After enduring weeks of abuse and witnessing other children being murdered in cold blood, the girl takes matters into her own hands and kills the ring leader. Ten years later, the girl has grown up to become \\"Bad Black\\", leader of the biggest crime syndicate in Kampala. Meanwhile, Alan Ssali, an American doctor whose parents were U.S. Army commandos, is in Kampala giving aid to the people of the slums. He encounters Bad Black, who mistakes him for a commando due to his designer dog tags. After receiving Alan's business card, Bad Black sneaks into his hotel and steals his money and passport. When the police refuse to help him, Alan receives kung fu commando training from his young assistant \\"Wesley Snipes\\" before storming through the slums to look for Bad Black. Elsewhere, Bad Black seduces Hirigi to exact her revenge on him. One day, a drug deal between Bad Black and a rival syndicate is disrupted by Kampala Police forces. The gangsters frantically run away from the cops, only to be gunned down by Alan, who corners Bad Black and recovers his dog tags before handing her to the police. Her subordinates storm into the prison and spring her out, along with their captured comrades and other inmates. Bad Black, however, decides to stay in prison to ensure the safety of another female inmate, who is to be released in two days. On the day of that inmate's release, Bad Black is put on trial for extorting Hirigi. As Bad Black is about to prove her innocence, the film suddenly fast-forwards to a flashback, when her father Swaz robbed a bank to pay for her mother Flavia's medical expenses, but was killed in a gunfight with the police and Flavia died shortly after childbirth. Just as Bad Black tells the court of her reasons for living a life of crime, Flavia suddenly arrives and embraces her daughter, forcing the judge to adjourn the court. Three months later, Alan resumes his medical mission in Wakaliga, but with Bad Black as his nurse. Hirigi's wife suddenly appears and opens fire at the medical camp, killing Alan in the process.

The Blu-ray release features the option to watch Who Killed Captain Alex? with or without the VJ Emmie narration, plus subtitles in 40 languages, and welcome videos by Nabwana IGG for 14 countries. Much like Who Killed Captain Alex?, Bad Black was generally received well by critics and audiences alike.

They are a special kind of aeolianites. This term was coined by Charles William Helm, lead researcher in the excavation of these fossilized pieces and is a relatively new discovery within the 2019 year. Deliberate sand impression have been discovered made in former sand dunes and beach deposits that have now been fossilized into rock and re exposed through the process of erosion. They were first noticed in coasts in the region of South Africa, an area rich in early rock art. They are dated to the Middle-Late Pleistocene, approximately 158,000 to 70,000 years ago. The sand impressions are theorized to have shown indications of foraging or development of symbols and patterns as a means of communication or art. Such patterns that have been discovered include repetitive figures in the shapes of circles and stylistic techniques that display lines in zig-zags, parallel lines, and cross-hatches. Similar rock markings in the site provide evidence to the theory that the ammoglyphs were also made by humans. Aside from sand impressions, South Africa's coast has also been home to well-preserved archives that indicate evidence of early life, such as rock engravings and jewelry.  Fossilization Process  The multi-step process that allowed for the preservation of the sand impressions included multiple layers of sediment drying and hardening before it could be impacted by wind erosion or water. Engravings or prints were usually left on wet sand, and eventually covered by dry sediment and left untouched. As more sediment piles onto the imprints or engravings, over time, it becomes compressed and hardens into a rock-like substance. The natural process protects the impressions and allows them to remain preserved as fossils over time.  Discovered Ammoglyphs  The most prominent fossil currently being analyzed is a \\"circular feature with a central depression,\\" which also contains apparent knee prints aside the piece of rock that is engraved. To create this circular engraving, it is assumed that the materials used were similar to that of a compass today. While using a forked stick, the engraver held the stick in the middle and fully created the circle, which also serves as an explanation for the slight discontinuity of the connecting ends of the shape. An additional piece of evidence currently being considered as an ammoglyph is a rock fragment containing multiple levels of symmetry. Although symmetry does not frequently imply man-made etchings and engravings, the several levels within this one piece of rock insinuates human effects on the rock. On this stingray-shaped rock, the symmetrical shape and intersecting cross-etchings accompanied by additional lines and round piercings further supports the ideology that this rock had been etched by humans.  Challenges to Developing Research  Due to the upcoming prevalence of this research, a couple challenges have arisen to understanding and interpreting the cruciality of each ammoglyph discovered. Primarily, due to the nature of such indentations found within each fossil (i.e. patterns, lines, and grooves), researchers have found it increasingly difficult to identify whether the indentations were created by man or due to natural causes. When this issue arises, researchers and archaeologists alike are searching for what Helm refers to as a \\"hominin signature\\" within the patterns they found. In addition to the issue of distinguishing man-made etchings from natural markings, the rock surfaces on the beach where these fossils were found have also potentially been utilized for modern graffiti locations. Therefore, there is not only an arising issue of distinguishing man-made from natural impressions, but also modern and \\"ancient anthropogenic origin.\\" From such graffiti, it may be simple to distinguish hearts and other recently popular symbols, but the markings of more abstract forms become increasingly convoluted with those of ancient origin.

Hamilton and starring Gino Anthony Pesi, Brinna Kelly, Jason Stuart, and Jon Jacobs. The film was also released on Blu-ray on 19 November 2019. The plot centers on a taxi driver and his passenger who find themselves locked in an endless time loop trap so they have to repeat their journey over and over again. Plot A cab drives through the night road to pick up a passenger. The cab driver, Harris Caron, is listening to a radio show about time-traveling aliens who changed the nature of reality. A charming young passenger calling herself Penny climbs into a taxi cab and asks to go to the corner of River and Elm. The car moves along a deserted dark highway, and Harris and Penny have a mildly flirtatious conversation. Suddenly, she disappears from the back seat of the car, leaving no trace. Bewildered, Harris contacts dispatch. The Dispatcher says he doesn't know what to do about a vanishing passenger and that Harris should just reset his fare and return to the city. Harris resets the mileage counter, and the prior events occur again more or less as they had before, though without Penny giving her name. The car crashes, and the barrier between the seats breaks. Harris grabs Penny's hand and asks if she is all right, calling her Penny. Penny says he used her name this time though she hadn't given it and tells Harris to remember her this time before she disappears. Harris again resets the meter, and the events occur again, this time with Harris having vague recollections of prior details. He realizes he has picked up Penny before. Penny, relieved, tells him the ride has occurred at least a hundred times, with Harris never remembering anything, suggesting they are trapped in a time loop that always ends with Penny disappearing and repeating the events. Through subsequent trips, their conversation grows more intimate. Penny, despite making up many humorous stories about her career during past rides, explains she is really in horticulture, which fits her floral attire and accessories. Harris explains he is a taxi driver because his father was, though he hates the job and felt his father wasted his life doing the task and he is doing the same. Penny is sympathetic but says she sees nobility in taking people to their destinations. She also feels trapped by her unhappy arranged marriage. Harris had a girlfriend once he met via a taxi ride, but the relationship had ended badly. After yet another disappearance, Harris decides to look for Penny. He does not reset his meter and drives down a different road, despite voices whispering to him to turn back. He eventually reaches a bright light where a dark figure demands he turn around. Harris resets his meter. He is still visibly upset when he picks up Penny again, and she comforts him, leading to them becoming passionate. Afterward, Harris notices a scar on Penny's head from when she hit her head in the car crash. The scar is old and Harris realizes they are not in a time loop but that time is actually passing. Penny is unable to answer his questions, but tells him to not drink his water before she disappears again. Harris does not drink his water and picks up a new passenger, an elderly man who asks to go to River and Elm. As he drives, Harris' memory of his old girlfriend return. The girl he had picked up in his taxi cab was in fact Penny, and they had spent a romantic summer together before she left suddenly. Harris subsequently died in a car crash. Harris takes the old man to River and Elm, a desolate place, and the old man pays him with a gold coin, like many other similar gold coins Harris finds in his cab. The Dispatcher calls to check in and tells Harris to get back to his job. Harris asks what is his job. The Dispatcher explains that Harris is his ferryman, a punishment given to him after he and Penny's relationship. The Dispatcher is Death, and Penny, who is actually Persephone, is his wife. Death had taken away Harris' memory of Penny, and Penny had provided water to erase his memory of his job. Harris had been unaware of years passing, only aware of when he drove Penny, something that happened yearly as she returned to the underworld. Harris returns to his job and drives many different souls to the afterlife. Eventually, it is again time to pick up Penny. She apologizes for everything and implores him to drink the water again for his own sake, but Harris says he has found nobility in his task and that he is grateful for their brief time each year to be together. He drops her off, and they express their feelings for each other before he drives away. . Cast *Gino Anthony Pesi as Harris *Brinna Kelly as Penny *Jason Stuart as The Dispatcher *Jon Jacobs as Frail Man *Matt Fontana as Dewey Reception The film was praised by critics‚Äîon review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on seven reviews. Michaela Barton of VultureHound gave the film four stars out of five, stating \\"Like all great sci-fi mysteries, this feature has a classic twist, with a revelation that builds and is actually supported by small clues hidden within each repeating cycle. The construction of this plot is satisfying, intelligent and earned. As this month is Noir-vember, this indie-feature is a welcomed modern addition to the month.\\" Jeremy Dick of MovieWeb wrote \\"The pleasing visuals do a lot to enhance The Fare as well, blending black and white with color depending on the context of the scene. A lot of effort went into the cinematography, and aesthetically, this particularly made watching the movie a lot of fun. The noir look is also appropriate given the mystery elements of the thriller, and some twists along the way sort of call back to some of the greatest sci-fi classics from years past. It's an interesting way of paying homage to a style of filmmaking which seems to have gone by the wayside in recent years, giving The Fare a rather unique feel compared to other contemporary movies. Paired with a hooking storyline, the cinematography helps make the movie that much better.\\" Hayley Paskevich of Fleep Screen added \\"By taking its central premise out of the realm of pure sci-fi and infusing it with a dose of Greek mythology, The Fare skillfully manages to avoid the trappings of monotony, instead driving the plot in a surprising direction, giving it new depth. As simplistic as the film itself may be from a structural standpoint, Pesi and Kelly‚Äôs performances are genuinely compelling, making it easy to become invested in the relationship between their characters. Full of twists, turns, and lighthearted humour, The Fare is a mythos-steeped love story that‚Äôs ultimately worth the trip, proving that sometimes the journeys we‚Äôre destined to take together are more significant than the destination itself.\\" See also * List of films featuring time loops References External links  Category:2018 thriller films Category:American thriller films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2018 films ","title":"The Fare"},{"id":"62640861","text":"This page documents notable tornadoes and tornado outbreaks worldwide in 2020.

Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Chad in the Mb√©r√© River, following this river as it flows to the southwest. It continues in this direction, then gradually arcs to the southeast, utilising various rivers (such as the Ngou, Guirma, Kad√©√Ø, Boumba, Batouri and Nyoue), with some shorter overland stretches, before reaching the Sangha River. It then follows this river down the tripoint with the Republic of Congo. History 300pxthumbleftMaps of Cameroon 1901-1972 showing the changes to the border with CAR The border first emerged during the Scramble for Africa, a period of intense competition between European powers in the later 19th century for territory and influence in Africa. The process culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control of the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger), and also the lands explored by Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza for France in Central Africa (roughly equivalent to modern Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville). From these bases the French explored further into the interior, eventually linking the two areas following expeditions in April 1900 which met at Kouss√©ri in the far north of modern Cameroon. These newly conquered regions were initially ruled as military territories. By 1903 within the AEF, the areas that now make up Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville (then called Moyen-Congo, or Middle Congo) were united as French Congo (later split), with areas further north organised into Ubangi- Shari (modern CAR) and Chad military territory; the latter two areas were merged in 1906 as Ubangi-Shari-Chad, and then de-merged in 1914. The two regions were later organised into the federal colonies of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, abbreviated AOF) and French Equatorial Africa (Afrique √©quatoriale fran√ßaise, AEF). Germany had claimed Cameroon (Kamerun) in July 1884. France and Germany established the rough delimitation of their respective spheres of influence in the region in December 1885, with a more precise boundary agreed upon in 1894. A further delimitation occurred on 18 April 1908, which produced the modern Cameroon-CAR border. Following the Agadir Crisis of 1911, France and Germany signed the Treaty of Fez, in which Germany recognised French supremacy in Morocco in return for large territories in Central Africa. The latter were attached to their Cameroon colony as New Cameroon and included much of what is western CAR. When the First World War broke out in 1914, Britain and France invaded Cameroon and eventually defeated the Germans in 1916. Following the defeat of Germany in Europe in 1918-19 all of the areas ceded to Germany in 1911 were restored to France, thus finalising what are now the Cameroon's modern borders with Gabon, Congo-Brazzaville, CAR and Chad. On 22 June 1922 Cameroon became a League of Nations mandate, with the vast majority of the colony going to France, and smaller areas along the Nigerian border in the west to Britain. This mandate/trusteeship arrangement was affirmed by the UN in 1946. France gradually granted more political rights and representation for its African colonies, culminating in the granting of broad internal autonomy to each colony in 1958 within the framework of the French Community. Eventually, in January 1960 France granted Cameroon full independence, followed by Ubangi-Shari (as the Central African Republic) in August that year, and their mutual frontier became an international one between two independent states. Since 2003 the border has been crossed by thousands of Central African refugees fleeing the Central African Republic Bush War and later the Central African Republic Civil War.

In her childhood she was raised in two different households after her parents died and she was exposed to the Franciscan charism under her second spiritual director. In 1854 she was professed into the Franciscan Third Order and in 1877 founded her religious order. Velotti also experienced several visions in her life such as visions of Jesus Christ and Francis of Assisi. Her beatification cause launched in the 1920s and she became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis confirmed her heroic virtue and titled her as Venerable in 2016 while later approving a miracle attributed to her in 2019 which would enable for her beatification. It was scheduled to be held on 16 May 2020 but the coronavirus pandemic forced its postponement. The celebration was rescheduled and celebrated on 26 September 2020. Life Maria Velotti was born in Soccavo in Naples on 16 November 1826 to Francesco Velotti and Teresa Napoletano. Her baptism was celebrated on that same date in the Santi Pietro e Paolo church in Soccavo. Her parents died before she turned two circa 1828 and she was sent to live with her unmarried aunt Caterina (who lived in Sirico near Nola) who would over time come to mistreat and abuse her. Her half-brother Giovanni (from her father's first marriage) remained in Soccavo and a chance meeting between the two in adulthood revealed their familial connection. Her initial education came from the local parish priest since there were no public schools in the area at that time and in her childhood was sometimes referred to as \\"Mariella\\". Her aunt's abuse extended to her spiritual life and she would often be assigned to housework so that she could not reflect on God in silence; her housework often took over two hours. But her situation became untenable at home and her married (and childless) neighbors Lorenzo Sabatino and Giuseppa Tuzzolo took her in and raised her as their own. Velotti could barely read or write. In her adolescence her first spiritual director and confessor was the priest Domenico Piciocchi but a chance meeting put her in contact with her second confessor and spiritual director when she turned 23. The teen met the priest Filippo Antonio da Domicella (who happened to be visiting the church) and under him she fostered a desire to join the Franciscans. The priest oversaw her vesting in the habit in the San Giovanni Evangelista convent-church in Taurano on 2 February 1853 and oversaw her profession into the Third Order of Saint Francis on 22 February 1854. Velotti took her religious name in honor of Aloysius Gonzaga and Paschal Bayl√≥n. In 1853 she started to experience visions of Jesus Christ on the cross alongside the Blessed Mother and Francis of Assisi; she also experienced visions of demonic harassment that once left her immobile and bedridden. Velotti also used iron tools for self-mortification. Her order was established in 1877 (alongside the widow Eletta Albini who later became Sister Maria Francesca) and it was aimed at educating girls and to promote the role of women in Neapolitan life. Her intention was also to dedicate herself to various charitable initiatives throughout Naples. Permission for the order's founding came from both the Cardinal Archbishop of Naples Sisto Riario Sforza and the Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor Bernardino da Portogruaro. Her reputation for piousness and her visions extended to the surrounding regions and Sforza (before his death in 1877) visited Velotti several times in order to better acquaint himself with her and understand her ideas. Her third spiritual director (she was hesitant in having another director) was Michelangelo da Marigliano. In 1884 she relocated to Casoria to the motherhouse where she would live until her death and spent her last weeks in a wheelchair with paralysis. Her death came after suffering from ill health for a prolonged period; she died in the order's motherhouse on 3 September 1886 at 9:00am in Casoria. Her remains have been housed in the order's motherhouse since 26 December 1926. Beatification The informative process for her beatification opened on 26 September 1927 and concluded a decade later on 22 December 1936; theologians assessed her writings and confirmed on 3 December 1944 that her few writings were in line with doctrine and were not in contravention. The second process in Naples was launched decades later on 2 October 2000 and concluded on 14 March 2001 before the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated both processes on 14 December 2007 to enable further investigation. The Positio dossier (detailing her life and reputation for saintliness) was given to the C.C.S. in 2010 with historians on 12 April 2011 voicing their approval for the cause. Theologians also issued their approval on 28 October 2014 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 19 January 2016. Pope Francis acknowledged her heroic virtue on 21 January 2016 and titled Velotti as Venerable. Francis later confirmed a miracle attributed to her on 11 December 2019 which enabled for Velotti to be beatified in Naples on 16 May 2020. The date for her beatification was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic but rescheduled and celebrated in Naples on 26 September 2020. The current postulator for this cause is the Franciscan Giovangiuseppe Califano.

Already in 968, he led attacks on the Ikhshidids, capturing Damascus and Ramla and extracting pledges of tribute. Following the Fatimid conquest of Egypt and the overthrow of the Ikhshidids, in 971‚Äì974 al-A'sam led attacks against the Fatimid Caliphate, who began to expand into Syria. The Qarmatians repeatedly evicted the Fatimids from Syria and invaded Egypt itself twice, in 971 and 974, before being defeated at the gates of Cairo and driven back. Al-A'sam continued fighting against the Fatimids, now alongside the Turkish general Alptakin, until his death in March 977. In the next year, the Fatimids managed to overcome the allies, and concluded a treaty with the Qarmatians that signalled the end of their invasions of Syria. Family Al- Hasan al-A'sam was born at al-Ahsa Oasis, the capital of the Qarmatians of Bahrayn, in 891, to Ahmad, son of the founder of the Qarmatian state, Abi Sa'id al-Hasan al-Jannabi. Power was held collectively among the sons of Abi Sa'id, although the youngest, Abu Tahir Sulayman al-Jannabi, was the dominant figure until his death in 944. After Abu Tahir's death, his brothers continued to hold power collectively until the 970s, when they began to die. At this point, their sons (al-A'sam and his cousins) were admitted into the ruling council. This means that, although al-A'sam was the principal military leader of the Qarmatians in their expeditions abroad, in reality power still resided with his uncles, the last of whom, Abu Ya'qub Yusuf, died in 977. Attack on Ikhshidid Syria Ikhshidid gold dinar, minted in 968/9 in Ramla Al-A'sam first appears as a commander of the Qarmatian forces that captured Damascus and defeated the Ikhshidid governor, al-Hasan ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Tughj in battle before his capital, Ramla, on 28 October. The town was plundered for two days, but the locals managed to buy off the Qarmatians with 125,000 gold dinars. Hasan was obliged to agree to an annual tribute of 300,000 dinars to the Qarmatians to maintain control of Syria. Medieval Arab historians (followed by the modern historian Michael Jan de Goeje) consider these events to have been a co-ordinated, unified strategy as part of the Fatimid Caliphate's imminent conquest of Egypt. However, modern scholarship has revealed that the Qarmatians were neither loyal partisans of the Fatimids nor, as becomes evident from their behaviour once victorious, were they interested in conquest and conversion of the Syrian territories to their doctrine. Rather, the Qarmatians were principally interested in the extraction of tribute to sustain their resource-poor state. For this reason, the Qarmatians had for decades been raiding wealthier regions of the Islamic world. Indeed, al-A'sam apparently fell into disgrace after being accused of embezzling some of the booty amassed during this campaign. When the Qarmatian army again departed for Syria two months later, he was replaced by two of his cousins at the head of the expedition. Campaigns against the Fatimids Map of Early Islamic Syria and its provinces in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries The disgrace did not last long, as the conquest of Egypt by the Fatimid general Jawhar in 969 and the subsequent advance into Syria, which led to the defeat and capture of al- Hasan ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Tughj at the hands of the Fatimid general Ja'far ibn Fallah in April 970, changed the situation. The Fatimid takeover meant the end of the annual tribute promised by al-Hasan ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Tughj, and the Fatimids' declared intention to restore the safety of the Hajj routes threatened to put an end to the Qarmatians' extortion of the Hajj caravans as well. This led to a radical shift of the Qarmatians‚Äîfor which some sources consider al-A'sam to have been the principal instigator‚Äîagainst the Fatimids and a rapprochement with the Abbasids. Through the mediation of the Abbasid caliph al-Muti, the Qarmatians became the nucleus of a broad anti-Fatimid alliance, comprising not only the Qarmatians, but also the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul, Abu Taghlib, the Buyid ruler Izz al-Dawla, the Bedouin tribes of Banu Kilab and Banu Uqayl, and remnants of the Ikhshidid troops. The Qarmatian army moved to Kufa, Rahba, and Palmyra, gathering allies, arms and money at each stop along the way. As they approached Damascus, Ibn Fallah chose to confront the allies in open battle, but was defeated and killed. =Capture of Syria and first invasion of Egypt= On 25 August 971, the allies captured Damascus, with al-A'sam proclaiming the suzerainty of the Abbasid caliph over Syria and having the name of the Fatimid caliph, al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah, ritually cursed in the mosques. The Qarmatians now turned towards Ramla. Jawhar had sent reinforcements, freshly arrived from Ifriqiya, to the city, but their commander, Sa'adat ibn Hayyan, withdrew to Jaffa and adopted a passive stance. The Qarmatians were thus left free to sack Ramla on 5 September 971. Encouraged by his successes, al-A'sam proceeded to lay siege to Jaffa with part of their forces under Akhu Muslim, and led the remainder of his army into an invasion of Egypt. Egypt was left almost defenceless, while the Qarmatian army grew with the addition of the Banu Tayy Bedouin to it. Al-A'sam entered Egypt at Qulzum, a month after capturing Damascus. Instead of moving directly against the Egyptian capital, Fustat, however, he moved north to the eastern Nile Delta. The coastal town of Tinnis, which had rebelled a year before against Fatimid taxation, rose up again in revolt, and the Qarmatians captured the town of Farama. A month later, a Fatimid army under Yaruq recovered Farama, but over the following weeks the revolt spread across the Delta, and Yaruq and his men had to retreat towards Fustat. The Qarmatians' detour nevertheless gave Jawhar time to prepare a ditch and wall, at Ayn Shams, north of Fustat, stretching for from the Nile to the Muqattam hills. The Fatimid general called almost the entire population of Fustat to arms, and in two fierce battles on 22 and 24 December 971, despite heavy losses, managed to defeat his opponents. The Qarmatians broke and retreated back into Palestine. Jawhar did not pursue them, but set a bounty on them, and many Qarmatians were killed as a result. Al-As'ar returned to al-Ahsa, but the Qarmatians remained in control of Syria. =Second invasion of Egypt= The Fatimids went onto the counteroffensive in 972, and managed to break the siege of Jaffa. In 973, the Qarmatian‚ÄìBedouin alliance disintegrated due to infighting, allowing the Fatimids to seize again control of Palestine and southern Syria. In the same year, the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz moved his court to the new capital of Cairo in Egypt. From there the Caliph sent al-A'sam a letter, accusing him of abandoning the Fatimid cause to which, as al-Mu'izz claimed, his father and grandfather had been devoted. Al-A'sam not only rejected al-Mu'izz's claims, but made the letter public and reaffirmed his opposition to the Fatimids and their claims, launching another invasion of the Fatimid domains. No details are known, but within a short time in late 973, the Fatimids were again driven out of Syria and Palestine, and in the next spring, the Qarmatians invaded Egypt for the second time. Once again, they found support among the local populace, which was exhausted by the Fatimids' heavy taxation. Al-A'sam occupied the eastern Nile Delta with the main army, but a smaller force under the Hasanid sharif Akhu Muslim bypassed Cairo and encamped between Asyut and Akhmim, driving out the Fatimid officials and collecting the tax revenues of Middle Egypt for the Qarmatian cause. Akhu Muslim's manoeuvre was all the more dangerous because many of the leading ashraf families flocked to join him. In April, al-Mu'izz sent one of his best generals, Rayyan, to the Delta. Rayyan defeated a Qarmatian force at Mahalla, but al-A'sam moved the main Qarmatian army to Bilbays, from where he threatened Cairo. Again the Fatimids were forced to a general call to arms of the entire male population of the capital to confront the Qarmatian advance. On 4 April, the Qarmatian advance guard attacked the Fatimid positions at Ayn Shams. The Fatimids' Berber soldiers repulsed the attack, but during the pursuit they were in turn surprised by a counterattack and suffered heavy losses. This led to the defection of one of the Fatimid commanders, Ali ibn Muhammad al-Khazin, and riots erupted in Fustat. At the same time, news arrived in the capital that Akhu Muslim had defeated a Fatimid army at Akhmim. Fearful of betrayal by the former Ikhshidid commanders now enrolled in his army, on 12 April al-Mu'izz arrested their sons as hostages. On 27 April, al-Mu'izz's son Abdallah led the Fatimid army out to confront the Qarmatians at the dry lake bed known as Jubb Umayra or Birkat al- Hajj, just north of Ayn Shams. Al-A'sam divided his army, sending his brother, al-Nu'man, to face the Fatimid advance, while he himself remained on a height dominating the lake bed. Abdallah exploited this mistake, by sending a corps to keep al-A'sam in check, while he destroyed al-Nu'man's force. He then turned on al-A'sam, who was defeated and barely escaped capture. The Fatimid victory spelled the end of the invasion. 10,000 Berbers pursued the Qarmatians, cutting off their supply routes, and recovering Palestine and southern Syria before the year was out; while in the south, Akhu Muslim dispersed his small army and barely managed to escape capture himself. Hunted by Fatimid agents, he sought refuge in al-Ahsa, but only ended up being poisoned by the Qarmatians, who were now engaged in negotiations with the Fatimids. =Final years= Forced to retreat from Syria, the Qarmatians allied themselves with Alptakin, a Turkish ghulam formerly in Buyid service. Alptakin invaded Palestine, defeated the Fatimids and captured several cities, before turning on Damascus, whose populace received him enthusiastically when he entered the city in April 975. In July 976, a Fatimid army commanded by Jawhar appeared before Damascus, and placed it under siege. The Qarmatians reacted by sending an army to aid Alptakin‚Äîaccording to some sources, the Damascenes appealed to the Qarmatians for aid‚Äîforcing Jawhar to lift the siege in January 977. The allies pursued Jawhar to Ramla, where they were joined by the Banu Tayy; Jawhar was defeated in a pitched battle at the Yarqon River, and was forced to abandon Ramla and retreat to Ascalon. The allies entered Ramla on 12 March. Most sources report that al-A'sam, already ill, died a few days after the allies entered the city. He was succeeded by his brother (or cousin) Ja'far. According to the account of Ibn al-Qalanisi (followed by Ibn al-Athir), however, al-A'sam was still active when the new Fatimid caliph, al- Aziz Billah, took the field in person and defeated the allies in summer 978. Following his victory, al-Aziz neutralized the Qarmatian threat by offering an annual tribute of 30,000 dinars (other sources give the sum as 20,000 or 70,000 dinars), paid in advance for that year. Although al-A'sam is reported as active during these events, more likely it reflects a confusion with his successor. At any rate, the agreement with al-Aziz marked the end of Qarmatian presence in the region.

Description The border starts in the west at the tripoint with Cameroon in the Sangha River, and then proceeds via a straight line overland towards the northwest. It then proceeds via a series of irregular lines to the north, generally following the Sangha-Ubangi drainage divide, before turning a broad arc to the east, and then continuing in that direction broadly following the Ibenga-Bodingu√© drainage divide. It then follows the Lobaye-Gouga drainage divide up to the Democratic Republic of the Congo tripoint at the confluence of the Gouga and Ubangi. History The border first emerged during the Scramble for Africa, a period of intense competition between European powers in the later 19th century for territory and influence in Africa. The process culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger), and also the lands explored by Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza for France in Central Africa (roughly equivalent to modern Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville). From these bases the French explored further into the interior, eventually linking the two areas following expeditions in April 1900 which met at Kouss√©ri in the far north of modern Cameroon. These newly conquered regions were initially ruled as military territories. By 1903 the areas that now make up Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville (then called Moyen-Congo, or Middle Congo) were united as French Congo (later split), with areas further north organised into Ubangi-Shari (modern Central African Republic) and Chad military territory; the latter two areas were merged from 1906-14 as Ubangi-Shari-Chad. In 1910 the whole region was united as French Equatorial Africa (Afrique √©quatoriale fran√ßaise, AEF). The internal boundaries of this colony underwent several changes: in 1926 the French transferred the town of Mba√Øki and the surrounding area from Congo to Ubangi- Shari, creating a boundary which roughly followed the drainage divide between Ibenga and Lobaye rivers. Further changes occurred in 1929, when Lobaye region was transferred from Moyen-Congo to Ubangi-Shari. In 1937 Haute-Sangha was added to Moyen-Congo. It appears that the border reached its final alignment at some point after the Second World War. After the Second World War France gradually granted more political rights and representation for its African territories, culminating in the granting of broad internal autonomy to each colony in 1958 within the framework of the French Community. Eventually, in August 1960, both Moyen-Congo (as the Republic of the Congo) and Ubangi-Shari (as the Central African Republic) declared full independence and their mutual frontier thus became an international one between two independent states.

Life  Born in Munich the son of the opera singer Wilhelm Ziegler (1857-1931), Ziegler studied at the University of Music and Performing Arts Munich. One teacher there was the Kammersinger Paul Bender.Paul Bender (1875‚Äì1947) He had his debut in 1909 as Silvio in Pagliacci at the Theater Augsburg. Further engagements took him to Dortmund, Stuttgart, Karlsruhe and Berlin and in 1925 he was engaged as a lyricist and baritone at the Oper Frankfurt. With the soprano Else Gentner-Fischer, who was married to him in a second marriage, he appeared there on the 1 January 1925. In February 1930 she appeared in the role of the spouse in the world premiere of Arnold Sch√∂nberg's Von heute auf morgen, directed by Herbert Graf and conducted by William Steinberg. Ziegler was dismissed from the city stage for racist reasons in 1933 after the transfer of power to the National Socialists. Else Ziegler's engagement in Frankfurt was also terminated in 1935 because of her marriage to a non-Aryan, so that she lived in complete seclusion in Prien am Chiemsee and died there in 1943. Ziegler took himself to safety in Great Britain in 1939, where he had to make his living as an unskilled worker.Beno Ziegler on Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon Ziegler owned a property in Karlsruhe, which had been administered by his brother Edmund (1879-1943) until the Aryanization. Edmund was deported to Gurs in 1940 and killed in 1943 in the Majdanek concentration camp. His nephew Paul-Alexander (1922-) was saved in 1938 by a kindertransport to England.Memorial Book for the Jews of Karlsruhe . The property is listed there as Karlstra√üe 8.

Description The border starts in the west at the tripoint with the Republic of the Congo at the confluence of the Gouga river and Ubangi river, and then follows the latter for much of its length, before reaching the confluence with the Mbomou River. The border then follows the Mbomou eastwards, with a very short overland section in the far east connecting up with the South Sudanese tripoint. History The border first emerged during the Scramble for Africa, a period of intense competition between European powers in the later 19th century for territory and influence in Africa. The process culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger), and also the lands explored by Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza for France in Central Africa (roughly equivalent to modern Gabon and Congo- Brazzaville). The area of the modern DRC was controlled by the Congo Free State, a state held under the personal rule of Belgian King Leopold II, who had sponsored various explorations in the region under the guise of humanitarianism. The boundary between French and Belgian territory was somewhat vaguely delimited at the time of the Conference, utilising the Congo river and then various lines of latitude and longitude. A protocol signed on 29 April 1887 further delimited the boundary as following the Congo river, then the Ubangi river up the 4th parallel north, and then following this parallel eastwards. Rivers of the border region In the following years France explored further into the interior, founding Bangui in 1889, and eventually linking their Central and West African holdings following expeditions in April 1900 which met at Kouss√©ri in the far north of modern Cameroon. These newly conquered regions were initially ruled as military territories, with the two areas later organised into the federal colonies of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, abbreviated AOF) and French Equatorial Africa (Afrique √©quatoriale fran√ßaise, AEF). As a result the French-Congo Free State boundary was modified to its current position by agreement on 14 August 1894. Administration of the Congo Free State was taken over by the Belgian government in 1908 following controversies engendered by the atrocities committed by Leopold‚Äôs forces there. The Belgian Congo gained independence (as the Republic of the Congo, later renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo) on 30 June 1960, followed by the French territory of Ubangi-Shari (as the Central African Republic) on 13 August 1960, and their mutual frontier became an international one between two sovereign states. Since 2003 the border has been crossed by thousands of Central African refugees fleeing the Central African Republic Bush War and later the Central African Republic Civil War.

History The effects of ultrasonic waves on microorganisms were discovered by French scientist Paul Langevin (1872 ‚Äì 1946) during World War I of usage of submarine sonar. During the carried out studies and experiments some biological effects were discovered, as microorganisms like algae cells were killed by ultrasonic waves. The powerful transducers used at the time produced a cavitation effect causing microbiological cells, algae to be lysed or broken into smaller fragments. Theory Low power ultrasound produces specific ultrasonic sound tones. These tones produce critical resonance frequencies on its own natural frequency of cell membranes, such as algae gas vesicles, vacuoles, plasmalemma cells. These sounds click causes disruption of the algae cell membranes to break or tear. The duration of this rupture can take up to several days or months, depending on the algae species. Critical life functions, such as loss of plasmalemma, bring algae to its life end. Low power frequency in the 20 - 200 kHz range is used in biotopes, ponds, natural swimming pools, large basins, water reservoirs and lakes.

Description The precise starting point of the border in the north is in dispute, owing to the fact that both Sudan and South Sudan claim the Kafia Kingi region, which is currently under Sudanese administration. Starting at the de facto tripoint, the border proceeds southwards for a short distance, before turning to the south-east.

Background According to the Vyborg Treatise of 1609, concluded between Tsar Vasily Shuisky and Sweden, the latter agreed to provide him with military assistance in the fight against False Dmitry II and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian invaders in exchange for territorial concessions. Thus began the campaign of Delagardi to Russia. The Swedish corps fought as part of the army of Prince Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky, who managed to clear a significant part of Russia from the interventionists and to release the besieged Moscow. However, in the Battle of Klushino, the Russian‚ÄìSwedish army was defeated, after which Vasily Shuisky was overthrown, and the Poles occupied Moscow. Jacob De la Gardie considered that Russia had not fulfilled its obligations to Sweden, and began to occupy part of the Russian north‚Äìwest. The motivation was the general weakening of the Russian state, which allowed for an aggressive policy, rivalry with the Commonwealth, as well as the personal interest of the Swedish military leaders, including Delagardi, in rich military booty. Storming of Novgorod At the beginning of June 1611, the army of Delagardi, consisting of Swedish, Finnish, German and other mercenaries, approached Novgorod and stood at the Khutynsky Monastery. The governor of the city was Ivan Nikitich Odoevsky, who led a garrison of a little more than two thousand people ‚Äì Cossacks, nobles, Astrakhan archers, as well as a small number of Tatars and monastery servants. The garrison had at its disposal relatively large artillery, but the city fortifications were dilapidated. Governor Vasily Buturlin was sent to Delagardi on behalf of the Zemsky Government near Moscow, headed by Prokopy Lyapunov, who entered into negotiations with the Swedes. In exchange for military assistance against the Poles, the establishment of the Swedish prince Charles Philip to the Moscow throne, as well as the transfer of Ladoga and Oreshek to Sweden, were discussed. However, the Novgorodians were outraged by territorial concessions and rejected Buturlin's agreement plans. Negotiations came to a standstill and Delagardi decided to storm the city. On July 8, the Swedes attacked Okolny City, but it was repelled. On July 12, city defenders made a sortie. On July 16, Delagardi launched a second decisive assault. A small detachment was instructed to make a distracting maneuver from the east side of the city. Another distracting maneuver was the attack of the Swedes in small vessels on a floating tower, set by the defenders on the Volkhov near Borisoglebskaya and Petrovskaya towers. Taking advantage of the fact that the defenders focused on the defense of the eastern side and did not expect an attack from the west, the Delagardi warriors went on the assault on Okolny City in several areas at once. Most successfully they acted near the Chudintsev Gate, laying several firecrackers. Sources report assistance to the Swedes from a certain Ivashka Shval, a boyar slave.Oleg Kurbatov. The Military History of Russian Troubles of the Early 17th Century. Moscow: Quadriga, 2014 ‚Äì Page 134 The infantry rushed into the resulting gaps, which soon recaptured the Chudintsev Gates from the defenders and opened them to Delagardi's strong cavalry. From the towers of Okolny City, the Russians methodically fired on the Swedes, however, after the cavalry attack, which began to quickly take over the streets, the fate of the city, despite the stubborn foci of resistance, was a foregone conclusion. A fire and general panic began in the city. Buturlin's warriors, who didn't initially have a good relationship with Odoevsky, after a brief resistance to the Swedes fled to the Trade Side, robbing its along the way, and then retreated to Yaroslavl. With a quick strike, the Swedes captured the Great Bridge over the Volkhov, cutting off the remaining defenders' path to retreat. Having taken the Okolny City, Delagardi entered into negotiations with the people of Prince Odoyevsky, who were in the detinets. Due to the futility of further resistance, an agreement was concluded under which Delagardi joined the Detinets on July 17. Novgorod completely came under the control of the Swedes. Occupation period Odoevsky signed a treaty with Delagardi \\"on behalf of the Novgorod state\\", according to which the Swedish king Charles IX was recognized as the \\"patron of Russia\\", and the prince Charles Philip as the \\"heir to the Russian throne\\". The accession to the treaty of the \\"Moscow and Vladimir States\\" was welcomed. Prior to the arrival of the prince, the contract provided for the transfer of control to Delagardi and Swedish officials. In fact, the agreement concluded meant the separation of Novgorod land from the general Zemstvo movement of Russia. The rest of the agreement repeated the provisions of the Teusina and Vyborg Treaties, maintained the old order in administration and legal proceedings, guaranteed the inviolability of the Orthodox faith and emphasized the alliance against the Commonwealth. The Swedish administration was carried out according to Russian laws and was duplicated by the Novgorod administration. The sympathies of the nobility were attracted by generous land awards on behalf of the prince. Novgorodians pledged to support the Swedes in their hostilities. After the election of Mikhail Romanov to the kingdom in 1613 and the loss by the Swedish king of the chances of the Moscow throne, the Swedish position in Novgorod was tightened. Evert Horn, who ruled Novgorod in 1614‚Äì1615, pursued a policy of direct subordination of Novgorod to the Swedish crown. Only the military failures of the Swedes, in particular during the Siege of Pskov in 1615, set King Gustav II Adolf to peace talks. Novgorod returned to Moscow under the Stolbovsky Peace of 1617. One of the most complete collections of documents of Novgorod office work during the Swedish occupation is the Novgorod occupation archive, which is stored in the State Archive of Sweden in Stockholm.

Bullock had gone to Mexico after touring the 2018 album Arms of a Dream and after separating from his wife. He said about the album; \\"Me and my wife separated and I‚Äôve been in that process of trying to understand our relationship and change our understanding of love. That has had a really deep effect on me and that‚Äôs at the heart of all these songs, me trying to understand love to be really blunt about it.\\" The song Faultline was originally demoed for the album Arms of a Dream, but never made it onto that album.

It took place between 1883 and 1885 and was commissioned by the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. The expedition was of a military, economic, diplomatic, and scientific nature. It was partly a training mission and partly to promote Swedish maritime and trade. Captain of the ship was Otto Lagerberg. Other participants were Crown Prince Oscar, meteorologist Gottfrid Fineman and physician and marine biologist Dr. Karl Rudberg along with more than 300 officers and sailors. On board was also the Swedish archaeologist and ethnographer Hjalmar Stolpe who during land excursions collected 7500 cultural specimens for an intended ethnographical museum in Sweden. The objects were acquired/purchased from indigenous and Western residents in all places Vanadis stopped. Stolpe was accompanied by photographer Oscar Ekholm which resulted in about 700 pictures.  Start  Vanadis left Karlskrona on 5 December 1883. Last stop in Europe was Lisbon in Portugal which they reached on 23 December.  South America  Hjalmar Stolpe during the excavations in Ancon, Peru. On January 23 Vanadis reached Rio de Janeiro. After Brazil the ship continued south to Punta Arenas, Borja Bay, Colombine cove (Newton Island), Molyneux Sound and Green Harbour. On the third of April 1884 Vanadis arrived to Callao, a port town 10 km from Lima, During the time Vanadis visited Lima, Hjalmar Stolpe did excavations at the archaeological site in Ancon. Numerous items at the Museum of Ethnography, Stockholm, are listed as having provenance Anc√≥n. These include five mummies with grave goods, along with surface-collected textiles. This material along with purchases of artifacts Stolpe made in Peru were shipped back to Stockholm. Vanadis approaching Jaluit in 1884. Painting by Jacob H√§gg.  The Pacific  Between May and August 1884 Vanadis called at several locations in the Pacific Islands. On May 8‚Äì12 they reached the first port, Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands and next stop was Fakarava in the Tuamotu Islands (15‚Äì17 May). Tahiti in the Society Islands was next island and here they stopped for almost two weeks (19 May ‚Äì 2 June), followed by Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands (20 June ‚Äì 10 July). Captain Lagerberg and the Prince made a visit at the palace and king Kalakaua visited the ship three days later. The prince and a few companions also made a private visit to see Kilauea volcano. Last stop in the Pacific was Jaluit in the Marshall Islands (26 July - 2 August).  Japan and Hong Kong (26 August - 29 October)  After 3 weeks at sea Vanadis arrived to Japan and first stop was Yokohama. It was time to look through the ship and make sure it was alright. There was also time for a very short audition at emperor Meiji in Tokyo. During their time in Japan they also experienced a very severe typhoon.  Philippines (1‚Äì6 November)  When Vanadis got to Manila, the reception was overwhelming. At the time the Philippines was part of the Spanish Empire and the Spanish governor wanted to make an impression on the Swedish Crown Prince. And he succeeded, Crown Prince Oscar was surprised by all the dinners, parties, excursions, flags and decorations in Swedish colours and fireworks that was arranged for them. Hjalmar Stolpe wanted to use the time to collect ethnographica from the locals. He hired a boat but after just a few hours at sea there was technical problems and they were forced back to land close to the village Cabeaben in the Mariveles mountains. Here they met people and Ekholm took about 20 photographs and Stolpe documented tattoos and managed to get hold of 80 objects, most of them from the boattrip to Mariveles.  Bangkok (17-22 November)  Ten days after Vanadis left Manilla they reached Bangkok in Siam (Thailand). They were met by the royal ship HMS Vesatri and the Swedes went over to Vesatri where they were welcomed by the ship's Danish captain Andreas du Plessis de Richelieu and his younger brother Lieutenant Louis du Plessis de Richelieu. The voyage into Bangkok went past what the crew experienced as very exotic landscapes and then up the Chao Phraya River. On board lunch was served with the entertainment of a forty-strong orchestra and after five hours moored the yacht at the Grand Palace. By then it had already become dark. The company received a warm reception from Prince Bhanurangsi Savangwongse, who made wagons available to them, and they were driven to the Prince's Palace (Saranrom) where most of them would spend the night. The most important event was the aucience with the king, Chulalongkorn. Commander Otto Lagerberg, Prince Oscar and the other officers received an invitation and after the usual honors, there was entertainment and display of the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaeo. The visit was only a few days but during this time Stolpe managed to collect an impressive collection through gifts from officials they met but also through buying every day objects at the bazaars.  Singapore (28 November ‚Äì 3 December)  Vanadis reached Singapore on 28 November. This wal a relatively short stop. Ekholm managed to take several portraits of various people from the area and Stolpe met Wilhelm von Malein, a Russian who spoke Swedish. With the help of Malein Stolpe bought objects that originated from Java, Borneo and Malacca.Erikson, Bo G. (2015) p. 326  India (16 December 1884 ‚Äì February 1885)  Unfortunately, there was a clash of characters between Hjalmar Stolpe, the expedition ethnographer, and the ship's captain, Otto Lagerberg, and when the Vanadis reached Calcutta in December 1884, Stolpe left the expedition, arranged for permits to travel through northern India and Kashmir for three months, and made his own arrangements for the return trip to Sweden. During his time in India Stolpe collected many ethnographical objects with the aim of providing ‚Äòa far richer picture of the northern Indian people‚Äôs way of life and cultural position‚Äô.  Africa (February‚ÄìMarch 1885)  On their way from India Vanadis stopped at Aden, Jemen. Svante Natt och Dag tells in his book about Aden that \\"all there is to say is that we arrived, stopped and left\\". On 20 February 1885, the ship entered Massawa, Eritrea. Here they saw Italian soldiers and they also met Swedish missionaries and visited their missionary station.Natt och Dag (1887) p. 159 The missionaries also visited Vanadis and had lunch on the ship and on 25 February they left Massawa.Natt och Dag (1887) p.162 In the beginning of March they reached Suez Canal and Port Said, Egypt. Next stop was Alexandria on the 11th. Svante Natt och Dag tells in his book about a trip to Kairo and the pyramids that a little group from the ship did the next day, amongst others the Crown Prince, Captain Lagerberg and Oscar von Heidenstam who was Swedish consul-general in Alexandria at the time. During this trip they also visited the khedive of Egypt, Tewfik Pasha.  Malta and Sweden (March‚ÄìMay 1885)  On 24 March Vanadis anchored at Valetta, Malta. Here they met consul- general Olof Fredrik Gollcher who arranged for the Crown Prince and a few others to visit the theatre.Natt och Dag (1887) p.179 After four days at Malta Vanadis continued towards Gibraltar which they reached on 11 April. Last stop on their way before Stockholm was Karlskrona and on the 9th om May Vanadis anchored in Stockholm.

It is a voluntary band, which means that its band members are not composed of full- time professional musicians. The band provided musical support for the community in the Kingston, Ontario metropolitan area as well as Ottawa- Gatineau. Outside of this band, the RCCS maintained multiple units bands, including the 2nd Division Trumpet Band, the 8th Division Trumpet Band and the Apprentice School Trumpet Band. History In the early 40s, a bugle band was attached to the RCCS and went with the unit during its tour of duty in Europe. The RCCS also maintained bugle bands in its 2nd Division, 8th Division Trumpet Band and Apprentice School.http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520Drum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved;=2ahUKEwjJw9qw5tPmAhUFXM0KHdBUBu4QFjARegQIARAB&usg;=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS On 1 March 1950, officers of the RCCS were presented a drum major's ceremonial mace and sash for use by the regimental trumpet band that predated the brass and reed band. The mace and sash were stored at Vimy Barracks until required for use by the band, which at the time consisted staff members of a base training establishment. The band was created in January 1952 as the regimental band of the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. A year after its creation, it was designated as the sole band to perform public duties and state functions in the National Capital Region, a similar role to the Central Band of the Canadian Armed Forces today. Due to its proximity to the Royal Military College of Canada, the band often performed at ceremonies the occur at the RMC (examples including the RMC-West Point hockey game, graduation parades and the Tattoo CeremonyRoyal Military College of Canada - Review Yearbook (Kingston, Ontario Canada) - Class of 1964 pg. 118), often in a more senior role compared to the Bands of the RMC. In the latter part of the decades, it was assigned to Canadian Forces Europe, in which it provided support to the regimental contingent at Canadian Forces Base Lahr. The last major event the band took part in was the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo 1967 for Canada's centennial celebrations that year. During the tattoo, during which it was under the direction of Captain K. Swanwick, the band notably played Vive la Canadienne during the march off, which prompted cheers of \\"Vive de Gaulle\\" in the audience. This was considered to be the public's response to the French President's closing phrase Vive le Qu√©bec libre during a rally on 24 July. In October 1968, as a result of the Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces earlier in the year, the band was merged with the Royal Canadian Dragoons Band to become the Band of CFB Kingston. Also known as the Vimy Army Band, it served as part of the successor organization of the RCCS, the Communications and Electronics Branch. In the 1970s the case the mace and sash were contained was moved to the Communications and Electronics Museum where they remained on display. In 1986, the tradition was reinstated for the Vimy Band and in 1987, a new drum major's sash was created, going into use until the band was disbanded in 1994.https://cmcen-rcmce.ca/ce-branch-band-recognition- ceremony/http://www.jproc.ca/rrp/comm_and_electronics_history.pdf&ved;=2ahUKEwjXn4qQu47oAhWuna0KHTdbBik4KBAWMAB6BAgCEAE&usg;=AOvVaw2KcaVkItAl3nJMeRuND3P_ Notable members *Charles Adams ‚Äì Director of Music of the Band of the Canadian Guards from 1966‚Äì1968 *Jack Kopstein ‚Äì Assistant director of the Central Band of the Canadian Armed Forces from 1979‚Äì1981 *Michael Savich ‚Äì The longest serving member of the Naden Band of Maritime Forces Pacific *Brian Williams *Jack Kane ‚Äì An Anglo-Canadian arranger, conductor and clarinetist *James Gayfer ‚Äì Director of the Band of The Canadian Guards in the 1950s and early 60s. *Sylvain Gagnon ‚Äì Former director of Band of the Royal Military College of Canada and the current director of the C&E; Band.https://sdm.queensu.ca/dan-school-faculty-and-staff/sylvain-gagnon/ References Category:Bands of the Canadian Army Category:Musical groups established in 1952 Category:1952 establishments in Canada Category:1968 disestablishments in Canada Category:Musical groups from Ontario ","title":"Band of the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals"},{"id":"62641746","text":"Anglo Scotian Mills, Beeston 1892 James Huckerby (1826 ‚Äì 25 March 1900) was a 19th-century builder and architect based in Beeston, Nottingham.

It is a brick two-story commercial building \\"which is distinguished by the two large brick 'chevrons' which break the roofline and function as false fronts for twin facade units. The 'chevrons' emerge from a unique banded brick ornamentation and are flanked by abbreviated piers which terminate with brick finials. The windows, which have cut stone sills and brick segmental arches with stone keystones, are united by a brick banding. The facade's first-story, with its recessed center doorway and border of black tiles with orange lozenges, was the result of a 1926 remodeling. Except for this, and a coat of green paint above, this building remains unaltered.\\" The building was deemed \\"architecturally significant for its unique brick ornamentation, which fits Marcus Whiffen's \\"High Victorian Italianate\\" classification. The brick banding and the two chevrons rising from it represent unusual craftsmanship in brick for its time and location. A. B. Moss is credited with founding Payette. He supplied the original ties for the Union Pacific Railroad by floating them down the Payette River to 'Boomerang' the name he gave to present day Payette. He was an extensive landholder in the area and was active in municipal government for many years.\\" At the time of National Register listing, the Moss family still owned this building, which was in use as a senior citizens center. It was in 1881 when A. B. Moss came to the Payette valley, and in the next year he got a contract from the Oregon Short Line Railroad to supply 250,000 railroad ties. He and a brother established a railroad supply camp store in Payette which eventually became the Moss Mercantile Company, the largest store in the area. It has also been known as Merchant Mercantile.

It was employed by writers including Brunetto Latini and Rustichello da Pisa and was presumably a written, not a spoken language. Absent a standard form for literary works of the Italian language at the time, writers in genres including the romance employed a hybrid language strongly influenced by the French language (at this period, the group called langues d'o√Øl). They sometimes described this type of literary Franco-Italian simply as French. Franco-Italian literature began to appear in northern Italy in the first half of the 13th century, with the Livre d'Enanchet.

The original hotel was a 400-room Holiday Inn and a 340-room Howard Johnson which was purchased and then renovated in 2008. History The original Chelsea was different hotel in a different location near the Atlantic City shore. The original hotel was opened in 1899 and had 250 rooms. It hosted distinguished guests including William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1927, twelve stories were added to the hotel. In 1942, during World War II, the hotel was used as housing for army personnel. The hotel would eventually be renamed to Sheraton- Deauville. In 1975, a fire broke out at the Sheraton-Deauville which caused $250,000 in damages and forced the evacuation of 300 guests. Between 1966 and 1968 seven national hotel chains expanded into Atlantic City. Among them was the \\"400-room Holiday Inn and 340-room Howard Johnson\\" which in 2008 would be renamed and become the current Chelsea Hotel. During this time, the original Chelsea then renamed Deauville was again renamed to Sheraton-Deauville. In 1981, the Tropicana Casino & Resort Atlantic City opened. By the mid-1980s the Tropicana demolished the Sheraton-Deauville to open TropWorld, an amusement center which included a three-story ferris wheel. In 2008, the Holiday Inn and Howard Johnson was remodeled and opened as The Chelsea after undergoing $100 million in renovation costs. The hotel does not have a casino. The Chelsea closed again in December 2016 after a gaming legalization deal for the hotel collapsed. In 2017, Tropicana Casino purchased the hotel after Carl Icahn purchased The Chelsea's mortgage. The Tropicana built a skyway connecting The Chelsea to the Tropicana. The new property is called \\"The Chelsea Tower at Tropicana Atlantic City\\" or simply \\"Chelsea Tower\\". The Chelsea reopened in the summer of 2018. Hotel The Chelsea is divided into two sections \\"the Luxe Tower in the Holiday Inn building and the Annex in the Howard Johnson\\" building. The Luxe rooms contains \\"animal-print chairs, large desks as white as disco boots and a pair of cockatoo-shaped lamps at bedsides\\". The hotel is offers restaurants such as Chelsea Prime and Teplitzky‚Äôs deli. The hotel has 358 rooms and has been described by Andrea Sachs as having \\"an old soul, adopting the history of its buildings' former occupants, the Holiday Inn Atlantic City-Boardwalk and the Howard Johnson\\". It is two blocks from Tropicana and 2.9 km from the Atlantic City Historical Museum. As of 2018, the Chelsea Tower has restaurants such as the \\"Chelsea Five Gastropub, Whiskey Five Bar and Gilchrist‚Äôs famous hot cakes\\".

Exhibitions range from the Archaeological Collection with finds from the prehistory and early history of the Ulm region (including the famous Lion-man), to paintings and sculptures created during the Late - or International Gothic art period and the Renaissance in Ulm and Upper Swabia. Collections of 16th to 19th century artisan works of Ulm's handicraft guilds are also presented. Conservator and university professor Julius Baum became the founding director and first art historian of the museum on 1 April 1924. According to his successor Erwin Treu, this started the real history as an institute emerged from a junk room.Erwin Treu, Geschichte des Ulmer Museums, in: Ulmer Museum.

The partly animal, partly human figure is called the Lion-man and represents an upright standing human with the head and the limbs of a cave lion. In an extremely complex restoration process in 2012/13, the figurine was completely re-assembled from over 300 fragments and has since revealed new details. In addition to the lion-man from the Hohlenstein-Stadel cave, the prehistoric environment of the Swabian Jura mountains is also documented. Numerous exhibits from the Upper Paleolithic to the Neolithic period, including the finds from the neighboring Bockstein Cave are shown. There is, above all, the exhibit of a Neanderthal thigh bone, the only substantial piece of evidence of this species ever found in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Also on display are the artefacts of Mesolithic burials of the Bockstein Cave and the Hohlenstein-Stadel.Eiszeitarch√§ologie auf der Schw√§bischen Alb.

A chronology of the region's International Gothic art period has been demonstrated, supported by valuable exhibits beginning with Meister Hartmann and Hans Multscher to Martin Schaffner, Michel Erhart, Hans Sch√ºchlin, J√∂rg Stocker, Niklaus Weckmann, Bartholom√§us Zeitblom to Daniel Mauch. The Late Gothic cultural landscape of Upper Swabia and the Allg√§u is illustrated by the works of Bernhard Strigel and others, which allows valuable direct style studies and comparisons. Representative works of artists of the 20th and 21st centuries also belong to the Ulm collection, among them Paul Klee, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, August Macke and Franz Marc. A highlight is the superb international Kurt Fried Collection. Amongst publisher Kurt Fried's 1959 to 1981 private collection the visitor will find works by Frank Stella, Mark Rothko, Roy Lichtenstein, G√ºnther Uecker, Yves Klein, Daniel Spoerri, Josef Albers, Max Bill and Gerhard Richter. The museum presents a variety of exhibitions in order to make the complicated relations among Ulm's Late Gothic artists come to light. The focus of research is on the Ulm families of artists around Hans Multscher, J√∂rg Syrlin the Elder, J√∂rg Syrlin the Younger, Michel Erhart, Gregor Erhart and Daniel Mauch.

Dating to the third and fourth centuries AD, this site demonstrates that forts were important to regulate the trade that came across the Saharan plateau and the High Plains. She has written on the Limes Mauretaniae - a Roman frontier territory 100km south of Algiers. = Augustinian archaeology = Benseddik has also studied the important site at Tagaste, where Augustine was born. = The history of museums in Algeria = Benseddik has also drawn together the histories of collecting antiquities in Algeria, and written a full history of museums within Algeria, and about it but abroad. An important contribution to this history is the role of the colonial military, which Benseddik has examined in detail.

Initially, Khawla Hamdi publishes on a web site the story that she has heard, where she can communicate with the protagonist, Nada, to find out more. After hearing the story thoroughly and gathering the details, she turns it into a love story that happened between Nada as story hero and Ahmad as hero of the Lebanese resistance. A love between the Arab Jewish community and the Lebanese resistance community. The novel impartially tells the true story of the real heroes, according to the author. The story of Rima, a Muslim girl, that after the death of her mother, adopted by Jacob and her wife Tanya and their two children, Sarah and Pascal, who are all Jewish. There is also the story of Nada, a Jewish girl, and Ahmad, a Muslim boy from the Lebanese Resistance Force, who tells of the reaction of Nada and Ahmad's sister, Samah, after Ahmed's disappearance. But soon the author abandons her impartiality and begins to provide evidence to persuade the reader to her religion. Jews in Djerba The novel takes place on the island of Djerba, one of the Tunisian islands. The story of this island is interesting in its own way. In the distant past some Jews moved to this island after the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar I -the king of Babylon and the commander of its armies- due to chaos in the east of the country. After settling on this enchanting island, they established their most famous synagogue, that now is the oldest in Africa. They also built many temples and shrines adjacent to muslim's mosques. The current number of Jews on the Djerba island does not exceed two thousand person, knowing that they are the descendants of the first immigrants to be mixed with the inhabitants of the land and that their survival on the religion of their fathers (Judaism) shows that Islam is not a hostile religion, otherwise this group of Jews had either been exterminated or expelled from the country. Synopsis The novel centers on the true story of a Jewish girl named Nada, who lives in Tunisia with her Jewish family. As the novel depicts the full details of Nada's life and Rima's life, it shows how fate drives them together to meet. Rima, a girl less than 15 years old, is raised by a Jew after her mother's death, until this Jewish man realizes that his daughter is interested in wearing the Islamic veil because of Rima and he sees this as a threat to his daughter so he asks Rima to leave his house. Rima comes from Tunisia to Lebanon after being evicted from her Jewish godfather's home, where she meets Nada and works as a maid at her home. The story continues until at a night, a masked young man knocks on Nada's house door to help heal his friend Ahmad, who was injured in clashes between the Lebanese resistance and Israel. Ahmad is one of the Lebanese Resistance Forces fighting against the occupation regime of Zionist. Ahmad, who was wounded and taken to Nada's home, is taken care by Nada. As a result, Ahmad becomes interested in Nada and ignores religious and sectarian differences. The story takes place in two areas: the first on the Djerba island in Tunisia and the second in the ancient city of Qana in southern Lebanon. Set in a Jewish neighborhood in southern Tunisia, the novel revolves around Rima, an orphaned Muslim girl raised in the shadow of her \\"uncle Jacob\\" Jewish family, whose beliefs begin to change and she tends to wear Islamic veil. Meanwhile, Uncle Jacob and his wife, Tanya, became angry with Rima and demand that she be removed from their children so that they will not be influenced by her beliefs about Judaism and Islam, so they send Rima to Lebanon and finally Rima meets the story hero Nada there. In southern Lebanon, the novel deals with the life of Nada, a Hebrew girl entitled by this novel whose belongs to the Jewish religion, though Nada was raised in a Christian home but chose Jewish religion following her mother. Nada's life is deeply affected after meeting Ahmad. A Muslim boy belonging to the ranks of Lebanese resistance against the occupation regime of Israel. The novel illustrates the relationship of Muslims with others, especially Jews, and also highlights the differences between Muslim women and Jewish women and their positions in the Quran. It also shows how Nada has been subjected to persecution and exile by her family after her conversion to Islam. As for Rima's fate, she is killed by a bombing in Qana when shopping at the market. The novel depicts the weakness of the Jewish religion by depicting terrorism, barbarism, and underestimating the status of women. The novel seems to convey the author's wishes and does not describe the reality of life, because in the Jewish community in Arab world, their relationships are largely limited to themselves. Comparison of religions The author attempts to compare religions in blatant triumph for Islam, and in some parts deliberately attempts to make this comparison expressed by the protagonist Nada, for example throughout the story heard: Muslim prayer are different from Christian worship that performed loudly and by richness songs, but close to Jewish worship, especially when Jewish worshipers repeat the Bible sentences softly or in their minds without talk about it. Throughout the story, the author's fanaticism appears in depicting non-Muslims and describing the heroes of the story.

Background and Initial Plans  After World War II, significant budget cuts and rapid demobilization had impaired the Army's ability to store and maintain equipment. While machine guns and towed artillery were available in quantity, self-propelled equipment, new tanks, and antiaircraft artillery was generally unavailable and in poor condition. General MacArthur also complained to military leadership about lack of personnel and general support of his Far East Command (FEC) in the late 1940s, with severe manpower shortages compromising his ability to defend Korea (which was not considered to be of strategic importance to the United States). The plan to recover equipment scattered throughout the Pacific region after World War II was initially proposed soon after the war ended, and even by 1947 nearly a million tons of materiel had been surplussed and sold to the Philippines alone. In 1949, 200,000 tons of ordinance was shipped to Japan for refurbishment. However, though Operation Roll-Up was originally expected to be complete by June 30, 1950, the lack of support and labor prevented full execution of the Operation's goals on schedule. While 90 percent of armament and 75 percent of automotive equipment available to the FEC was derived from the first stages of Operation Roll-Up, effective readiness of materiel in the Far East Command was limited to 60-day stocks at depot levels and an additional 30 days in station stocks. These were average levels (some equipment was barely to be found at all) and one estimate put the \\"unserviceable\\" levels of these 60 day stocks at around 80 percent. For some types of equipment, only about one quarter of the advertised number of units were actually able to operate. Less than a tenth of the recoilless rifles assigned to the Eighth Army were functional.  Expedited Action  Within two weeks of the start of the Korean War, it became apparent to the Army that the 8th Division would have to be generally committed to fighting over the summer, and additional reinforcements were requested from Washington. To support the Army's buildup and the losses encountered early in the fighting, the process of recovering WWII equipment was expedited, with much of the labor provided by Japanese seamen operating American-flagged ships. This Much of the rehabilitation was performed in Japan, with initial preparation in the combat area itself supported by Korean locals in addition to US personnel. Vehicles were deconstructed, cleaned with chemicals or rebuilt to be made functional, tested to ensure functionality (including test drives through an obstacle course), and shipped to the front lines as quickly as possible. For example, 52 hours after Marines were ambushed in Chosin, a complete set of equipment required to rearm the unit was shipped to the front lines. Ultimately, 45 percent of the tanks, 82 percent of armored cars, and 75 percent of the artillery used in the conflict were recovered equipment left behind after the end of Pacific operations in WWII. The reclamation process extended beyond vehicles. The first three months of fighting saw 100,000 tons of munitions expended, all of it surplus from WWII and recovered during Operation Roll-Up. Additionally, 89,000 M1 rifles were refurbished and committed to battle within the first four months of fighting. Sixty-four percent of precision instruments such as surveying equipment was reclaimed, and ultimately 80 percent of infantry weaponry (including bazookas and mortars) were recovered from WWII stocks.  Results  The massive influx of equipment allowed the initial losses to be overcome more rapidly than shipping stored equipment (however well maintained) could be accomplished from depots on the American mainland. Perhaps more importantly, the facilities and infrastructure required to perform the refurbishment contributed to rebuilding Japan's industrial base. In addition to providing material support to the fighting on the front, the operation was advertised as a cost-saving measure, with many of the per-unit costs being reduced by 50 to 95 percent over new unit fabrication. The Army claimed hundreds of thousands of dollars of savings in reclaiming rubber tires alone. As a whole, this and other cost saving measures were advertised as $8 billion.

It also includes a bay (south side) receiving the outlet from Lake Verch√®res, a small bay on the east shore receiving the outlet from Lac des Bouleaux, another bay on the east shore receiving two streams. This lake has a narrowing generating a strait of a hundred meters in width demarcating the northern part of the lake. The first outlet from this lake is located at the bottom of a bay on the north shore, at: * north-east of route 175 connecting the towns of Quebec (city) and Saguenay (city); * east of a bay on the southeast shore of Talbot Lake which is crossed by the Petite rivi√®re Pikauba; * south-west of Lac √† Mars; * south-east of the junction of roads route 175 and route 169; * south- west of the dam at the mouth of Lake Ha! Ha!; * south-east of Kenogami Lake; * south-east of the confluence of the Chicoutimi River and the Saguenay River, that is to the downtown of Saguenay (city). From the mouth of Lake Pikauba, the current descends the course of: * the Pikauba River (1st outfall) on first towards the south, then generally towards the north; then, Kenogami Lake on to the east, then to the north; * the Cyriac River (2e outfall) on generally towards the north; then, Kenogami Lake on towards the north; * the rivi√®re aux Sables on towards the north; * the Saguenay River on eastward to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.  Toponymy  The term \\"Pikauba\\" is derived from an Innu term, \\"opikopau\\", meaning \\"lake constricted by alders, ...\\". Opi is a root to indicate that something is closed or tightened. \\"Kopau\\" is an Innu ending in this indicative to designate a lake with alders, rushes and others. The map of provincial surveyor Frederic William Blaiklock from 1852 mentions the name \\"Chicoutimi Lake\\" to identify this lake. The specific \\"Pikauba\\" is used in several toponyms of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. Father Laure's 1731 map rather indicates ‚ÄúOuapikoupau River‚Äù. According to Father Joseph-√âtienne Guinard, in the Innu and Cree languages in particular, there is the ‚Äúpikobaw‚Äù form that Father Laure translates from the Innu language as ‚Äútightened or masked by rushes‚Äù. Another source claims rather that \\"pikobaw\\" breaks down into \\"pik\\", meaning \\"menu\\", \\"kobaw\\", \\"brushwood\\" and \\"wabi\\", \\"white\\", giving \\"white brushwood\\" or \\"small brushwood\\". formalized in history: Grand lac Pikauba, Lac Picauba and Upikauba. The toponym \\"Lac Pikauba\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968} by the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.

The film was intended as a pilot for a potential television series. Production While unhappily working on Archer, a television series adaptation of Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer stories, writer Arthur Weingarten began thinking about doing a mystery series with a different concept. The studio was uninterested but Weingarten decided to pursue the rights to the character himself. Friendship with Graham Greene got Weingarten an introduction to Georges Simenon. Weingarten locked down American rights but spent five years gathering rights in other countries to attain worldwide rights to the character. He then approached every American network about creating a Maigret series with no success until CBS agreed with the stipulation that he cast an international star. Richard Burton was the first approached and he was keen but two weeks before filming was to commence he dropped out to do Private Lives on Broadway. Sir Alec Guinness was next approached but he declined. Weingarten spent a year negotiating with George C. Scott, but Scott eventually pulled out and with him went CBS. At this stage, Columbia Pictures Television agreed but Weingarten still needed a Maigret. After viewing A Man Called Horse one evening, he decided to approach Richard Harris. Although Harris didn't physically fit the role, he was up for the challenge as a fan of the character. The project got additional funding from HTV and Coca-Cola which brought the budget up to $3 million (US). Filming was shot on location in Paris and West Country. The script was drawn from a number of Simenon's original novels and the setting was moved up to the then-modern 1980s. Cast *Richard Harris - Jules Maigret *Patrick O'Neal - Kevin Portman *Victoria Tennant - Victoria Portman *Ian Ogilvy - Daniel Portman *Barbara Shelley - Louise Maigret *Andrew McCulloch - Sgt. Lucas *Caroline Munro - Carolyn Page Release The film was unsuccessful critically which ended any possibility of it spawning a television series. Three years later, fellow Irishman Michael Gambon stepped into the role for another ITV production entitled Maigret which ran for twelve episodes.

In 1987, a year after WCCW left the NWA and became the World Class Wrestling Association, the title was abandoned. As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is won not by actual competition, but by a scripted ending to a match. The NWA Texas Brass Knuckles Championship was created in 1953 in the Houston, Texas National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) territory Southwest Sports, promoted by Ed McLemore. The first champion was \\"Wild\\" Bull Curry, who defeated Danny McShain in the finals of a tournament. The \\"Brass Knuckles\\" title was originally created for Curry, who used a very hard hitting, brawling hardcore style of wrestling, with a \\"no disqualification\\" stipulation for all championship matches. Over the years Bull Curry would win the championship a record setting 24 times, with Mark Lewin and Bruiser Brody tied for second most reigns at eight total. Due to a lack of documentation, especially from the 1950s to the 1970s, it is possible that Curry won the championship more than 24 times. In 1966, Fritz Von Erich bought Southwest Sports from McLemore, and continued to promote the brass knuckle championship in the renamed \\"Big Time Wrestling\\" promotion. In 1982 Big Time Wrestling was rebranded as \\"World Class Championship Wrestling\\", including all the championships dropping the \\"NWA\\" prefix for \\"WCCW\\". In 1986 WCCW left the NWA completely and was renamed \\"World Class Wrestling Association\\" WCWA and renamed all championships as well. Abdullah the Butcher was the last wrestler to win the championship in Texas, defeating The Great Kabuki on July 4, 1986. The championship was not promoted again until WCWA announced that Tony Atlas had won the championship at a non-WCWA show in Montreal, Canada. No record exists of Montreal show, leading to the possibility that the Atlas title victory was fictitious and used to explain why the championship was no longer used. Over the years the championship has been vacated several times, often with a tournament held to determine the next champion, only details of the 1968 tournament, won by Kurt Von Hess, and the 1969 tournament, won by Baron Von Rascke have been found.

She also is an Adjunct Professor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and was awarded the 2018 Crop Science Society of America Presidential Award. She is probably best known for her recent work concerning the effects of specific atmospheric pollutants, including ozone and carbon dioxide, on the productivity of selected major crops such as corn and soybeans. A highly influential researcher, in 2019, Ainsworth was ranked in the top 1% by citations for her field.  Early life and education  Ainsworth grew up in small town Illinois, United States where she worked on a corn field. Ainsworth earned a bachelor's degree at the University of California, Los Angeles. Here she discovered ecology, and spent two semesters completing field work in Thailand. Ainsworth was inspired by her first measurements of photosynthesis to dedicate her research career to plant biology. She was a doctoral student under the supervision of Stephen P. Long at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, before spending a year as a Humboldt Fellow at Juelich Research Center.  Research and career  Ainsworth is a plant physiologist at the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service with the Global Change and Photosynthesis Research Unit. She holds an adjunct position at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Her research was the first to make use of biochemical and genomic tools to establish the mechanisms by which plants respond to climate change. In particular, Ainsworth studies how rising levels of carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone impact crop production. At the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign Ainsworth is a lead investigator of SoyFACE (Free Air Concentration Enrichment). As part of SoyFACE Ainsworth leads an open-air laboratory that allows her to grow plants in atmospheric conditions that are similar to those predicted to be present in 2050. It is important to grow the soybeans out of a greenhouse to ensure their phenotype is more representative of those farmed in the real world. SoyFACE is a multi-faceted study that involves the use of satellite instruments, ozone surface monitors, metablomic approaches and historical yield data. This has involved monitoring genetic variation in maizes in response to elevated concentrations of ozone. To achieve this, Ainsworth has developed high- throughput DNA phenotyping to understand the genes and networks of genes responsible for ozone sensitivity. This allows her to establish the genetic changes that occur in plants due to climate change, as well as monitoring which plant species survive best in an effort to breed more ozone-tolerant varieties. She showed that during the 2010s a large proportion of the United States soybean and corn harvest has been lost to ozone pollution. She estimates that current ozone levels decrease corn yields by up to 10%, which is comparable to the amount lost to drought, flooding or pests. In 2011 Ainsworth identified that future levels of ground-level ozone could reduce the yields of soybeans by almost one quarter by 2050. = Academic service = Alongside her academic career, Ainsworth is involved with initiatives to increase the representation of women in science. She has led summer camps for high school girls (Pollen Power) to teach young people about plant science and the Earth's future climate. She is involved with the Plantae Women in Plant Biology network. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include: * 2009 USDA ARS Midwest Area Early Career Research Scientist of the Year * 2011 Society for Experimental Biology President's Medal * 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists Charles Albert Shull Award * 2012 University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign University Scholar * 2015 United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Diversity & Equal Opportunity Award * 2018 Crop Science Society of America Presidential Award * 2019 National Academy of Sciences Prize in Food & Agricultural Sciences * 2019 Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science *2020 Elected member of the National Academy of Sciences = Selected publications = Her publications include:  * The publication list on her UICI web page identifies her as author or co-author of 33 articles about her work from 2014 through 2019.\\"Recent publications.\\" Accessed January 1, 2020.

It is a reboot of the Battletoads series, and the first new entry in 26 years following 1994's Battletoads Arcade. The game was released on August 20, 2020 for Xbox One and Windows platforms and on November 10, 2020 for Xbox Series X/S platforms. Gameplay Like the original Battletoads, the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up. Up to three players can play cooperatively as the Battletoads Rash, Pimple and Zitz, each with distinct playstyles. The game's graphical style is hand-drawn and has more of a cartoon-styled aesthetic than prior series games. The game has an obstacle course reminiscent of the original game's notoriously difficult Turbo Tunnel, but instead of the original's side view, the one in the reboot has the camera behind the bikes. The rebooted sequence retains its nostalgic difficulty, with its game over screen providing the player with messages of encouragement, but it also features selectable difficulty settings.https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/07/31/battletoads-incoming-anarchic- amphibians-arrive-august-20-with-xbox-game-pass/ Plot Trapped in a fantasy simulator bunker for 26 years, the Battletoads awaken to discover they are no longer intergalactic heroes and have fallen into modern-day obscurity. In a bid to reclaim their glory, they set out to once again defeat their old longtime nemesis, the Dark Queen. But when they confront the queen, they end up teaming up with her to take down an evil alien race called the Topians, who have not only stolen the queen's powers but also were the ones who trapped the toads in the bunker. Development The reboot was developed by Dlala Studios with the assistance and supervision of series creator Rare. Dlala Studios previously worked on Overruled, a platform brawler. Prior to the game's announcement at E3 2018, the Battletoads series had been dormant for decades and was last displayed in the 2015 retrospective compilation Rare Replay. Rare's intention was to remake classic Battletoads gameplay without the limitations of 1980s hardware. The game received its first gameplay trailer at the June 2019 E3 and was playable at Microsoft's November X019 trade show. The game was originally anticipated for a 2019 release as an Xbox One exclusive, but was later set for release on August 20, 2020, for Xbox One and Windows. Reception In a preview of the game, IGN wrote that the game lacked the difficult platforming for which the original was known, though the game itself remained difficult. GamesRadar praised Dlala's progress on the game at a mid-2019 demo. =Critical response= Battletoads received mixed reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the PC version 65/100 and the Xbox One version 72/100. Chris Scullion of Pure Xbox gave the game 8 out of 10, praising the animation, dialogue, soundtrack and wide variety in difficulty, but was more critical of repetitive levels, limited moveset and puzzle sections.

According to The New York Times, it is also a mass surveillance tool of the United Arab Emirates intelligence services, used to gather private information on users' phones. The Timess reporting, denied by the app's developers, caused Google and Apple to remove the app in December 2019.  Features and development  The ToTok app offers free messaging, voice calls and video calls. Conference calls involving up to 20 people can also be made. According to the New York Times, the app appears to be a slightly-customized copy of YeeCall, a Chinese messaging app. Popularity Introduced in 2019, it soon found a wide user base in the Emirates. Its spread was aided by the fact that the Emirati government blocks certain functions of other messaging services such as Skype and WhatsApp, and was apparently the first Voice over IP app to gain regulatory approval. The app was also promoted by state-linked Emirati publications and by the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. That ToTok appeared to not be affiliated with a powerful country may also have helped its popularity in the Middle East. In December 2019, BotIM, a subscription-based messaging app, sent its users a message recommending ToTok for free messaging and calls. As of December 2019, ToTok was among the most-used 50 free apps in several countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, India and Sweden. , the app had 7.9 million downloads between the iOS App Store and Google Play, with nearly two million daily users. Surveillance tool reports On 22 December 2019, The New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence assessments and the paper's own investigations showed that ToTok was used by Emirati intelligence to gather all conversations, movements, relationships, appointments, sounds and images by the app's users. The app does not use exploits, backdoors or malware. Instead, it gives the government access to the information shared through the app, as well as to other information on the smartphone that the government can access through permissions granted by users in order to enable the app's features. According to the Times, the company behind ToTok, Breej Holding, is a front company of DarkMatter, an Emirati intelligence company under FBI investigation for cybercrimes. The Times also linked ToTok to Pax AI, an Emirati data mining firm tied to DarkMatter and located in the same building as the Emirates' Signals Intelligence Agency. Breej Holding denied that its app was a spy tool, writing that its users \\"have the complete control over what data they want to share at their own discretion. The shameless fabrication by our distractors cannot be further from the truth.\\" The Emirati telecommunications agency issued a statement that emphasized what it said were the country's strict privacy laws, but did not directly address the Timess reporting. The local Khaleej Times interviewed the \\"ToTok co-founder\\" Giacomo Ziani, who confirmed that he bought YeeCall's code, but also denied that his app was a government surveillance tool. In response to the Timess inquiries, Google and Apple removed ToTok from their respective app stores on 19 and 20 December.

In 1909 a new ‚Äústate-of-art‚Äù hospital building opened, which was equipped with an X-ray machine. In 1910, Martha A. Pippereit was superintendent. When the operation outstripped the church group's ability, leaders of the hospital turned to the Masonic Order.

Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Queen Charlotte is a land-based naval training establishment crewed by part-time sailors and also serves as a local recruitment centre for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). It is one of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada.  Namesake  The current day naval reserve unit is named after HMS Queen Charlotte, a ship-rigged sloop constructed for the Upper Canada Provincial Marine in 1810 at Amherstburg, Ontario for service on Lake Erie.  History  Established as the Charlottetown Half-Company of the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve (RNCVR), by September 1923 the required minimum of 30 volunteers had been enrolled and Lieutenant George Buntain became the first Commanding Officer of Queen Charlotte. In the beginning, the unit occupied meagre accommodations housed alongside local militia (army) units. However, as recruiting and training needs increased, a new location was approved and Queen Charlotte moved to the Navy League building located on Haviland Street in Charlottetown. The unit moved once again to the Simms Building on the corner of Kent and Hillsborough Streets in Charlottetown in 1936 and on November 1, 1941 the unit was commissioned as a division. During the Second World War, Queen Charlotte not only served as training location for local recruits and was also responsible for housing and training recruits from other naval divisions across the country. After the Second World War, Queen Charlotte became a demobilization centre. Eventually, with the reorganization of the navy into the newly formed RCN, Queen Charlotte was reverted back to her original status as a reserve division. A new building was constructed for the division in 1959 (the present day Queen Charlotte Armoury) but five years later, on December 15, 1964, Queen Charlotte was paid off and the facilities were turned over to the Canadian Militia.Queen Charlotte Armoury, now home to the Museum of the Prince Edward Island Regiment.In the early 1990s, the Department of National Defence looked to revitalize the Canadian Navy and in 1993 the Minister of National Defence announced plans to re-establish HMCS Queen Charlotte as a Canadian Forces Naval Reserve Division. The unit began training in June of 1994 and was re-commissioned on September 17, 1994. Initially housed at rented facility in the West Royalty Industrial Park, two years later, in September 1996, the ground breaking ceremony took place for a permanent facility and one year later Queen Charlotte shifted ship on September 23, 1997. Today, Queen Charlotte trains sailors and teams for Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) domestic and international operations, while at the same time supporting the Navy's efforts in connecting with Canadians through the maintenance of a broad national presence. Reservists employed at Queen Charlotte are individuals who are otherwise engaged in full-time civilian careers while pursuing a part-time military career as an officer or non-commissioned member. They train and work for the Navy in the evenings, on weekends and during the summer period. Most serve on a part-time basis, with no obligation to participate in any mission overseas.

The first ship, built in 1828, is generally recognized as the first ship in the service of what became the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O;).  1828 ship  In 1828, William Fawcett of Liverpool and Joseph Robinson Pim of Dublin commissioned the construction of a paddle steamer named William Fawcett. The ship was built by Caleb and James Smith at the Queen's Dock, Port of Liverpool. As built, the ship was long, with a cargo capacity of 185 tons. In 1835 the ship's length was given as , with a gross register tonnage of 206. The firm of Fawcett, Preston and Company, of which William Fawcett was part- owner and manager, provided the steam engines, rated at 130 horsepower, for the ship. The ship was employed in the packet trade between London, Cork and Dublin. The ship was sold to Richard Bourne and associates in 1832 for service with the Dublin and London Steam Packet Company. In 1835 Bourne partnered with Brodie McGhie Willcox and Arthur Anderson to charter the William Fawcett for five voyages between London and the Iberian Peninsula. This service is regarded as the beginning of the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company, which later became the P&O.; The first four trips of the William Fawcett for the Peninsular company in 1835 turned around at Lisbon. The fifth trip reached Gibraltar. In 1837 and again in early 1838, the ship was chartered by the Peninsular company for a trip from London to northern Spain and return. The ship was refitted later in 1838, and afterwards chartered by the Peninsular company for two trips between London and Madeira.

Woods worked with her husband, journalist Donald Woods, on anti-apartheid activities and both fled into exile to the United Kingdom in 1977. Woods herself was an active member of the Black Sash. In exile, Woods worked with various charities and after her husband's death, set up the Donald Woods Foundation. She and her family are featured in the 1987 movie, Cry Freedom.  Biography  Woods was born Wendy Bruce in Mthatha on 5 February 1941. She did well in school, skipping a year ahead and eventually leaving home at age 16 in 1958 to work in Pietermartitzburg as a librarian. She attended Trinity College of Music where she earned her Teacher's Licentiate and became a music teacher. Her family had a cottage in Transkei Wild Coast, which is where she met her future husband, Donald Woods as a young person. She married Donald in 1962, and converted to Catholicism. They moved to East London where her husband worked for the Daily Dispatch. Together, the couple had six children, five of which survived past infancy. Woods described herself and her husband as \\"politically late developers,\\" having grown up in a small town among racist adults. Woods joined the anti- apartheid women's group, the Black Sash. She began to demonstrate in East London with members of the group. A friend, Barbara Briceland, said that Woods was very active in various anti-apartheid campaigns. She also helped hide those hiding from the police. She visited activist Steve Biko in prison. Through the 1970s, the security police bugged their home and they were subject to harassment and threats from the police. Eventually, her husband was banned by the South African government, so Woods would have to talk to people, including the media, in his stead. She also went to the inquest into the death of Biko, which took place in Pretoria. Woods took notes that her husband would later use to write about Biko's death. During the 13 day inquest, her five- year-old daughter was sent a shirt that was laced with acid by the security police, burning her and spurring the family to choose exile. In 1977, her husband disguised himself as a Catholic priest and left the house, fleeing to Lesotho. Woods left the next day with her children and was able to make it past the border by distracting the border official. They fled to London, settling in Surbiton. Her husband traveled all over the world during their exile, campaigning against apartheid and Woods stayed in London, caring for their children. Both she and her husband worked as consultants on the film that depicted their family and Biko, Cry Freedom (1987). In exile, Woods also worked for various charities, including the Canon Collins educational trust and Amnesty International. She also collected \\"thousands of books\\" for the University of Fort Hare, Nelson Mandela's former university. She also wrote articles against apartheid. Before his death in 2001, Donald Woods had started the Mandela Statue Fund, which Wendy Woods took over. Seven years later, she was able to unveil a nine-foot statue of Mandela which is located in Parliament Square. She founded a foundation in her husband's name, the Donald Woods Foundation, in 2003. She worked as the foundation's chair for ten years, helping to build health clinics, educational workshops and other programs for vulnerable people and children in the Eastern Cape.

Its mission is ‚Äúconnecting people to a broader world through German language and culture‚Äù Origin In 1957, a group of German clubs based in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area came together to form the Volksfest Association, which represented German Minnesotans at that year's centennial statehood celebration. After the centennial, eager to obtain an official building, it raised money through selling bonds and organizing fundraising events. In 1965, it purchased a home on Summit Avenue for $57,500 () and refurbished the interior to accommodate large social gatherings. Originally built in 1906 for the family of George W. Gardner and his wife, Claribel, the 301 Summit Avenue home had four stories, including a third-floor ballroom and ratskeller. After George and Claribel's deaths in 1934 and 1938, respectively, the house was owned by their son, Truman. In 1948, Truman sold the house to the Sisters of St. Benedict, and it became known as St. Paul's Priory. By the 1960s the Sisters of St. Benedict had outgrown the property, and in 1965 they sold it to the Volksfest Association before moving to Maplewood, Minnesota. Later that year, the Volksfest Association moved into the Gardner home and began to use it as its headquarters. They called it the Volksfest Kulturhaus‚ÄîGerman for \\"culture center\\". The building also served as a community hub where German Americans, Minnesotans of German heritage, and anyone interested in German culture could come to learn and celebrate. Later history During the 1980s and 1990s, the Volksfest Association board of directors underwent a generational shift as younger members replaced older ones. In 1994 members decide to transform the organization from a social club into a non-profit institute and rename it the Germanic-American Institute, or GAI for short. The organization's shift in focus was also precipitated by an influx of non- Germanic immigrants to the Minneapolis area, as well as the perceived disconnect between newer generations and their German heritage. In the 1990s, many public schools in the metro area began to drop German-language classes from their curricula. In response, the GAI founded the Twin Cities German Immersion School in 2005. Among other programs, the GAI offers a summer language camps for children, provides comprehensive German language instruction to adults ranging from new to fluent speakers, and hosts events and speakers that celebrate and promote understanding of German culture, traditions, and history. In the 2010s, the GAI board of directors anticipated another generational shift. It recognized that although German American millennials had grown up in a globally connected world, they were further removed from their German heritage than ever before. To adapt to this change, the GAI began restoration projects for the house and parking lot and planned new programs to attract younger generations of visitors.

It is sometimes called caramel tree for the light, sweet smell it emits during leaf fall, sometimes compared to cotton candy (candyfloss) or \\"freshly baked biscuits and bread\\". It is grown as an ornamental tree for its heart shaped leaves that in autumn turn a mixture of bright yellow, pink and orange-red. Description Cercidiphyllum magnificum is a small deciduous tree, growing to no more than 10 m in height and pyramidal to broadly conical in shape. The tree has a smooth bark. The twigs bear leaves that are dimorphic with both short and long shoots. The short shoots bear large cordate (heart-shape) or reniform (kidney shaped) leaves with palmate venation and crenate margins, while the long shoots have leaves that are elliptic to broadly ovate with entire or finely serrate margins. The leaves are up to long and broad, and are initially bronze coloured, but in autumn turn a mixture of bright pink, violet and yellow, giving off a scent of burnt sugar when they fall, hence the name \\"caramel tree\\". The species is dioecious, having separate male and female trees, with small inconspicuous flowers appearing early in spring that are wind pollinated. The flowers lack petals, the male being reddish and the female greenish. The female trees produce woody, pod-like fruit in clusters of 2‚Äì4, each about long. The pods contain many seeds small flattened seeds that are winged at both ends. It is similar to Cercidiphyllum japonicum, but can be distinguished by a combination of the following characteristics: C. magnificum is a smaller tree that typically has only a single main trunk (vs. large, canopy-forming, with multiple trunks); the leaves are more deeply crenated; the follicles have partially dehisce, with slightly recurved tips (vs. follicles fully dehiscing and strongly recurving tips); grows at a higher elevation, rarely co-occurring with C. japonicum. Taxonomy Cercidiphyllum magnificum is, along with C. japonicum, one of only two members of the genus Cercidiphyllum and family Cercidiphyllaceae. It was first described as a variety, C. japonicum var. magnificum, in 1919 by Japanese botanist Takenoshin Nakai, then separated into a different species the following year in his Catalogus seminum et sporarum Hortus Botanicus Universitatis Imperialis Tokyoensis. The type locality is from Honshu, Japan in the Ashio Mountains (Mount Nikk≈ç-Shirane and Mount Konsei. Distribution and habitat Cercidiphyllum magnificum is endemic to the central, forested mountainous areas of Honshu. Uses The katsura wood is soft and light and used for cabinetry and paneling.

In 1957 he married Phyllis Albrecht Gutwein whom he would later have five children with and who would serve on the Lafayette City Council from 1984 to 1999. In 1959 he graduated from Indiana University with a Bachelor of Science degree and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law in 1961. In 1961 he became a precinct committeeman in Francesville and in 1964 he was appointed as Lafayette's city attorney by Mayor Donald W. Blue. On March 7, 1966 he announced that he would run for the Republican nomination for state representative from Tippecanoe County. On May 3, 1966, he and Frances Gaylord won the top two Republican primary and both received the Republican nomination and both went on to win in the general election against Democratic nominees Harry A. Fink and Robert L. Huffman. In the 1967 session he served as chairman of the Cities and Towns House committee and served as a member on the Judiciary and Natural Resources and Conservation committees. On November 27, 1968 he was elected as House Majority Floor Leader after defeating four other candidates on the third ballot with 36 out of 71 votes. On January 13, 1971 he introduced an constitutional amendment to Indiana's constitution that would lower the voting age from 21 years old to 18 years old two months ahead of the federal 26th Amendment.

Over the next few decades, the Jewish community in the city grew very quickly, such that by the time Transilvania, under Austro-Hungarian control, was known as Grand Principality of Transylvania, it was second in size only to the one in Alba Iulia. By around 1785 or so, the Jewish community in T√¢rgu Mure»ô had just one wooden synagogue to congregate in, which could fit between 150‚Äì200 people. By 1870, the community grew to around : Cuv√¢ntul Liber: Statistica evreilor din jude»õul Mure»ô; 20 avril 2007‚Äì people. The Jewish population played an important role in the development of the city. Jews would be found amongst a wide range of professions ‚Äì editors, merchants, industrialists, bankers, doctors and small scale artisans. A youth school was founded in 1880, which moved in 1890 into a house on Horia street. During the 19th century, and as part of the Schism in Hungarian Jewry, a majority of the community moved away from orthodox judaism, and adopted the Status Quo Ante monicker ‚Äì a monicker specifically used by some Jewish communities in Transilvania (traces of which can still be found in parts of Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and the Ukraine). The size of the Jewish population continued to grow through the first part of the 20th century, up until the start of World War 2, passing 2755 in 1910 and 3246 in 1920 respectively, to a peak of 5693 in 1941. By the time of the Interwar period, the community was operating two synagogues ‚Äì the Great Synagogue on »òcolii street, and another one on BrƒÉilei street, for a total seating capacity of 1200. The Second Vienna Award and the annexation of northern Transylvania into Hungary in September 1940 was catastrophic for the Jewish community in the city. By 1944, the city had attracted many refugees from the smaller cities and villages in the area, and the population was estimated to be around 8000, representing approximately 16% of the population of T√¢rgu Mure»ô.: Sinagoga Tirgu-Mures; website for the synagogue The Hungarian authorities, under instructions from admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy ‚Äì who was at the time regent of the Kingdom of Hungary and an ally to the Third Reich ‚Äì moved the Jewish population into a ghetto installed in an ancient brick factory. Between 27 May and 8 June 1944, under orders received from Adolf Eichmann, the Jewish population from T√¢rgu Mure»ô and the surrounding region was deported to Auschwitz. Almost none of the 7550 deported Jews survived.Randolph L. Braham and Attila Pok: The Holocaust in Hungary I-II; Editor: East European Monographs; 15 April 1997; After the end of World War 2, most of the survivors of the Shoah moved to Israel.

The start of construction of the synagogue at the end of the 19th century signaled, for the \\"Status Quo\\" Jewish community of T√¢rgu Mure»ô, a definitive detachment from the orthodox Jewish community in the rest of Transylvania. The synagogue was inaugurated in 1900 by rabbi Dr. Joachim Wilhelm, in the presence of leaders of the local Jewish community: Adalbert Burger (president for the community) and Mendel Farcas (vice-president). The inauguration celebrations took 3 days and 3 nights.: A marble plaque, placed in the entrance hall, is marked with the names of principal donors to the construction.: Situl Sinagogii din Tg.

In 1998, with funding provided by the Federation of the Jewish Communities in Romania and by various private donors, a renovation was started, reaching eventual completion in 2000. Significant work was performed, including reinforcing the walls and foundations, interior and exterior restoration, closely matching and following the original architectural designs and paint. Most of the efforts to raise funds, oversee and complete the restoration, and rehabilitate the synagogue, were performed by the president of the community, Bernath Sauber, and by his secretary, Alexandru Ausch.

The Synagogue's Architecture  The eclectic architecture presents itself as a mix of styles. The exterior contains typically roman architectural elements, mixed with some elements showing gothic inspiration ‚Äì for example the rose windows ‚Äì as well as some showing moorish inspiration, such as scalloped profiles or domes which borrow from Islamic architecture. As part of the last restoration, the building was repainted in an apricot color, with all of its ornaments and window frames painted in white. The synagogue is possessed of a large, octagonal, central tower, with small rose windows on each of its sides, and topped by a roof lantern, as well as two smaller, octagonal, towers, topped by onion domes at each of the two corners of the facade. Each tower is topped with a Star of David. The entrance to the synagogue is a gate with three arcades, separated by twin columns and backed by pillars. Underneath the entrance, sits a gothic central rosette with an inscription, quoting the Tanach in Hebrew: \\"My house is a house of prayer, for all the people:Livre d'Isa√Øe; Version Chanoine Crampon; 1923\\" (Book of Isaiah 56-7). Roses decorate the two towers, at the facade's corners, on the first floor. The doorways on the ground floor for the two towers open to stairs, allowing women exclusive access to the second floor's seats. The interior of the synagogue continues in the eclectic style, remaining \\"luxurious, but in good taste\\". The architectural forms are brought into relief in the profile fo the various arches, the consoles, the various tracery and carved, coloured, elements. The style shows inspiration from roman, gothic and baroque architectural styles and elements, and follows patterns found in Catholic churches built during the same period. The interior is richly decorated, both in shape and in an abundance of colors: the railing for the women's gallery, built out of cylinders separated by geometric motifs, whites inside colored circles on a green background, four rose marble columns, cylindrical on an octagonal base, supporting the cupola from its sides, painted in green, yellow and orange parts on a blue and red background, the central Bimah surrounded by a railing in two shades of green. The rustic wooden benches for the faithful are located opposite the Torah ark in four rows, at the rear of the synagogue, one row on each side of the Bimah and in front of it. Opposite the entrance is a square apse ‚Äì the Torah Ark ‚Äì where the precious Torah scrolls are enclosed, in a semi-circular region supported by two columns, and topped by a bulb dome. Attached to the gate of the Ark, a plaque recalls the memory of the victims of the shoah. The inscription (in Hebrew) reads: > \\"Our city counts 5943 martyrs. The stones of the walls themselves, and the > whole of the Jewish people mourn the extermination of our parents and our > dear loved ones who were asphyxiated and burned at Auschwitz in the year > 5704 (1944).: Arhitectura sinagogii\\" Photos of the interior of the synagogue Image:Syna Targu Mures int 1.jpg Image:Syna Targu Mures int 4.jpg Image:Syna Targu Mures int 2.jpg Image:Syna Targu Mures int 5.jpg Image:Syna Targu Mures int 3.jpg  Notes   External links  * : Website for the Targu Mure»ô synagogue * : Cuv√¢ntul Liber: Statistica evreilor din jude»õul Mure»ô (Statistics related to Jews in Mure»ô County); 20 avril 2007 Category:T√¢rgu Mure»ô Category:Historic monuments in Mure»ô County Targu Mure»ô ","title":"Status Quo Synagogue"},{"id":"62644449","text":"Namoi Shire was a local government area in the North West Slopes region of New South Wales, Australia.

He dealt with multi-variable geometric control theory, stochastic control and stochastic filters, and more recently the control of discrete event systems from the standpoint of mathematical logic and formal languages. Education Wonham attended a boys‚Äô school and preferred individual to team sports, taking up sailing and tennis. Wonham obtained his bachelor's degree in engineering physics from McGill University in 1956, and then a doctorate in stochastic control from the University of Cambridge in 1961. Career In the 1960s, he worked at Purdue University's Control and Information Systems Laboratory, Martin Marietta's Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS) in Baltimore, Brown University's Department of Applied Mathematics, and in the Office for Control Theory and Applications of NASA's Electronics for Research Center, where he developed a geometric theory of multivariable control with A. Stephen Morse. In 1968, Wonham proved a separation theorem for controls in a more general cost functional class with many technical assumptions and restrictions. Wonham returned to Canada in 1970, after fifteen years away, and joined the University of Toronto as an associate professor in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. Being with the university's Control Theory Group as a full professor since 1972, he served as Dean of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the University of Toronto between 1992 and 1996. He was made university professor in 1996 and appointed University Professor Emeritus upon his retirement in 2000. Wonham and his student Bruce Francis first articulated the internal model principle in 1976, which is a good regulator restricted to the ordinary differential equations subset of control theory.B. A. Francis and W. M. Wonham, \\"The internal model principle of control theory\\", Automatica 12 (1976) 457‚Äì465. As an explicit formulation of the Conant and Ashby good regulator theorem,Roger C. Conant and W. Ross Ashby, \\"Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system\\", International Journal of Systems Science vol 1 (1970), 89‚Äì97. it stands in contrast to classical control where the classical feedback loop fails to explicitly model the controlled system (although the classical controller may contain an implicit model).

He also published works that defended the Franciscan order. Sedulius was also a poet.  Background  Sedulius was born in Kleve, Germany. He died in 1621 at Antwerp.  Works  In 1607, Sedulius published the Apologeticus aduersus Alcoranum Franciscanorum, pro Libro Conformitatum. This is a defense of the Franciscan Order, drawing from Bartholomew Albizzi's commentary of the Scripture as well as citations from the Christian founders and ancient philosophers. Particularly, his arguments were directed against Erasmus Alber's criticisms included in the text called Conformities. Diva Virgo Mos√¶- Traiectensis, a devotional booklet written by Henricus Sedulius. In Historia seraphica, Sedulius published a collection of quotes from famous writers who praised St. Francis and these included St. Bonaventure as well as other prominent Franciscans. In an account, Sedulius said he relied on the former's collected works (constituting eight volumes) that were published by the Typographia Vaticana from 1588 to 1596. Historia likened St. Francis to an angel, introducing the book with a quote from the Book of Revelation: \\"And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God.\\" Sedulius also wrote the Icones sanctae Clarae B. Francisci Assisiatis primigeniae discipulae and the Imagines Sanctorum Francisci, which is an illustrated collection of various saints. Sedulius collaborated with Jan Moretus, the owner of Plantin Press, on the publication of several religious texts. An account described how Sedulius' interest in history emerged during his stay in Italy and Tyrol. In addition to religious texts, Sedulius also covered historical events such as the martyr stories (e.g. Gorcum martyrs) during the Eighty Years' War. There are texts, including versions by other authors, that contained an engraved portrait of the author or portraits engraved by owners who thought that Sedulius was the author. Sedulius is said to have written his works mostly in Latin and has worked with his colleague Cornelius Thielmans on translated versions.

The beginning, addressing the singers soul to sing praises and be thankful, is reminiscent of psalms and the Magnificat. In the first stanza, thanks are given for the creation of the world and for the time full of mercy which was promised from the beginning. The second stanza reflects Jesus, born from Mary, as a redeemer of mankind by becoming part of it. In the third stanza, the singer addresses a group to sing with Mary, to be faithful to his word as she was, and to offer sorrow and joy, and all life that he gave, to the Lord of Glory (\\"Herr der Herrlichkeit\\").

He is best known for his map of an invented landscape known simply as \\"Jerry‚Äôs map\\". Gretzinger has been working on his map for over 60 years; it has grown to include over 3,000 unique panels, and is constantly evolving. Jerry‚Äôs map has been shown at numerous international museums including the Palais de Tokyo, MASS MoCA, and the American Folk Art Museum.  Early life  Gretzinger was born on November 5th, 1942 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Gretzinger was a bright student who excelled at school which would earn him a National Honor scholarship. Throughout childhood, Gretzinger never became involved in organized sports or other extracurricular activities and, ‚Äúthe truth was that I never felt like I belonged.‚Äù He collected oil company maps and would pour over his maps and the family‚Äôs encyclopedia. These allowed him to imagine a world beyond his horizon.  Early career  Gretzinger attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he enrolled in the department of architecture. While living in Ann Arbor following his sophomore year, he was working at a ball bearing factory. During breaks in his work, Gretzinger began to sketch a map on a sheet of paper and when his drawing reached the edge of the page he continued onto the next sheet. These were the first panels of what would become \\"Jerry‚Äôs map\\"/ Gretzinger transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where he continued his studies. During his first fall in San Francisco, Gretzinger applied and was accepted into the Peace Corps. In 1964, he completed training and moved to Tunisia for his service. In 1966, Gretzinger completed his studies at the University of Michigan and that year he returned to Tunisia to be an architect and project manager working on an archeological project The Corpus of the Ancient Mosaics of Tunisia.  Personal life  Gretzinger married in 1965. Nelle, his daughter was born in 1966. Three years later, in 1969, they were joined by their son, Aaron. In 1971 Gretzinger separated from his wife. In 1980 he married Meg Staley and in 1983 they welcomed their first son together, Hank, and in 1986 their second son, Lucky.  Career  Gretzinger left North Africa to move to New York City in 1971 where he set himself to start a new career. He says, ‚ÄúI knew that I wanted to make things, make a living from what I made, and that‚Äôs what I devoted myself to.‚Äù He organized a textiles show of imported Tunisian and Moroccan rugs and began a small business selling pillows and bags he had been making. Partnering with the SoHo Designer‚Äôs Collective, he began to design a line of experimental clothing. Together with his second wife Meg Staley, Gretzinger launched Staley/Gretzinger which expanded his clothing line with Meg‚Äôs commercial and printmaking experience. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company grew to be a commercial success. In the years following his move to New York, Gretzinger continued working on his map and it grew in size and complexity; as the business grew and his responsibilities increased, he put the map into retirement to devote himself to the business. Gretzinger moved to Cold Spring, New York and acquired a farm in Maple City, Michigan.  Rediscovery of map to present  In 2003, Gretzinger‚Äôs son Hank discovered the map which had been archived in their Cold Spring attic and very soon Gretzinger began work on the map again in earnest. In 2009, he had his first show of the map at the Garrison Art Center in Cold Spring with an accompanying video documentary produced by independent filmmaker Greg Whitmore. The video was featured as an editor‚Äôs choice on Vimeo and shortly after, he was invited to exhibit the entirety of the map and a reproduction of his studio at MASS MoCA. Since then, his map has been featured in numerous publications and solo and group exhibition. Gretzinger‚Äôs work on the map has grown increasingly abstract incorporating new elements of erasure and collage. Looking towards the future of the map, he sees himself working on the map for as long as he can and is actively looking for museums and collectors to serve as permanent homes for the map.

In 1992, Consumer Reports tested Kordich's Juiceman II extractor and concluded that other competitive models were easier to clean, were cheaper and worked better.

For example, Kordich stated that he was influenced by the Gerson diet and was cured from cancer when he was 20 by consuming 13 glasses of apple and carrot juice each day. Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch noted that Kordich made far-fetched, nonsensical and unproven health claims about juicing. These included his belief that uncooked foods flush the body of toxins (detoxification), and that juicing can treat many illnesses such as anemia, anxiety, arthritis, gallstones, impotence and heart disease.

She lectures on food and home cooking and has published four solo books on the subject and has contributed to many others in collaboration or as a ghostwriter. Those she has collaborated with include Gwyneth Paltrow, Dana Cowin, and Mario Batali. She hosts the podcast Keep Calm and Cook On and writes a monthly column in Food & Wine called The Interview. She has written for the New York Times, Cond√© Nast Traveler, Vogue, and Bon App√©tit. She serves on the Smithsonian National Museum of American History's Kitchen Cabinet Advisory Board and is the founder of Equity At The Table (EATT), a digital directory of people of color, women, and non-binary individuals in food. She also regularly provides meals for Citizen Action New York, which led to her 2016 appointment as developer of the organization's food team. Early life Turshen grew up with one brother in a liberal, secular New York Jewish household. Her parents were workaholics; (Queery podcast, 12:20) her mother was an art director and her father was a graphic designer. Turshen wanted to work on cookbooks from a young age, always poring over cookbooks with great interest. At age 13, she even opened a mini restaurant in her family's home. Her maternal grandparents, refugees to the United States, owned a bread bakery in Brooklyn, which Turshen's mother grew up in. Though she never met her grandparents, Turshen believes these roots created a \\"hereditary, genetic\\" (Queery podcast, 10:08) pull toward cooking within her. As her parents did not cook much, she taught herself with the help of books and the pre-Food Network television landscape of Julia Child and the Discovery Channel's Great Chefs show. In between high school and college, Turshen worked at Kneaded Bread Bakery in Port Chester, New York. Education Turshen did not attend culinary school; rather, she attended Manhattan's all-women's school, Barnard College, where she studied poetry and majored in English. During her tenure, she interned for a food magazine, a cookbook author, and a food show television producer. She ended up working for the producer part-time while still in school. (Queery podcast, 19:06) Career Turshen was hired right out of college, by the television producer for whom she had interned and worked, to serve as assistant to a writer who had been hired to write the companion book for a PBS travel show about food and cooking. (Queery podcast, 19:40) The job was in Spain, and Turshen bought a one-way ticket there. When the writer dropped out of the project, Turshen was afforded the opportunity to write the book herself, and she did. Next, she co-authored and otherwise collaborated on approximately ten cookbooks, ranging from a Korean cookbook to a Vietnamese cookbook to a cookbook about breads from around the world (Queery podcast, 30:40), supplementing her meager income by working as a private chef for wealthy clients. (Queery podcast, 25:26) Using her experiences, Turshen published her first solo book of recipes and stories in September 2016. (Queery podcast, 28:35) In 2016, Turshen released her first solo cookbook, Small Victories: Recipes, Advice + Hundreds of Ideas for Home Cooking Triumphs. It was listed as one of The New York Times' best cookbooks of that year, one of NPR's best cookbooks of that year,https://apps.npr.org/best-books-2016/#/book/small-victories-recipes- advice-hundreds-of-ideas-for-home-cooking-triumphs and one of the best cookbooks for holiday giving, according to the Boston Globe. In 2017, Turshen released Feed the Resistance: Recipes + Ideas for Getting Involved, whose proceeds she donated to the ACLU. The book was a meditation on food and activism. It went on to earn Eater's Best Cookbook of 2017.

Early life Rabon was born in Le Havre. Career Rabon became a member of the Acad√©mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture on 3 July 1660.Montaiglon 1875, p. 169. His reception piece was a portrait of Antoine de Ratabon, who at the time was both Superintendant of Buildings (Surintendant des B√¢timents) and the director of the Acad√©mie.Montaiglon 1893, p. 27.Williams 2015, p. 313. His portrait of Ratabon was for a long time believed to have been lost,Fontaine 1914, p. 250. but in 1994, a painting in the collection of the Ch√¢teau de Versailles, which had previously been identified by Albert Laprade as a portrait of the architect Louis Le Vau, was proposed as more likely to be Rabon's portrait of Ratabon.The subject of this portrait was identified as Louis Le Vau in 1955 by Albert Laprade, who recognized the plan as that of the southwest corner of the old Louvre, that is the Bathing Apartment of the Queen Mother Anne d'Autriche, remodeled by Le Vau in the summer of 1661, and the building illustrated in the background as the pavilion at the north end of the Louvre's Petite Galerie (see Galerie d'Apollon), constructed after the fire of 1 February 1661 (see also Laprade 1960, chapter 3, plate 1). Christophe Hardouin disputed Laprade's attribution in an unpublished thesis for the University of Paris and identified the painting as Pierre Rabon's presentation piece before the Academy on 3 July 1660, which portrayed Antoine de Ratabon (1617‚Äì1670), Surintendant des B√¢timents (see Thierry Bajou; also Hilary Ballon 1999, p. 201, note 8, who was unable to examine the thesis but cites Bajou). Bajou comments that the \\"building plan and the facade therefore correspond to projects and not to completed buildings. It is unfortunately, just as impossible to confirm this identification, by comparing the sitter's features with those in other painted, sculpted or engraved portraits.\\" Rabon exhibited a portrait of a Monsieur Perier at the Paris Salon of 1673. His other works include Portrait of a Woman (private collection) and three other portraits known from engravings: Claude Gallard, Councillor at the Parlement, engraved by Jean-Baptiste Humbelot; Louis Roupert, Master Goldsmith at Metz, engraved by Louis Cossin; and Hyacinthe Serroni, Archbishop of Albi, engraved by Gantrel. There are also records of copies commissioned by the B√¢timents du Roi: Christ on the Cross after Charles Le Brun in 1667 for the Menagerie at Versailles and Equestrian portrait of Louis XIV after Mignard in 1671.Bajou 1998, p. 76. In 2000, the painting Saint John Preaching in the Desert (Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Carcassonne), previously believed to be a work by S√©bastien Bourdon, was reattributed to Pierre Rabon.Collection des Mus√©es de France (Joconde), Ref√©rence 04400001087.

It was undertaken by Charles William Wilson, a 28-year-old officer in the Royal Engineers corps of the British Army, under the authority of Sir Henry James, as Superintendent of the Ordnance Survey, and with the sanction of George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon as Secretary of State for War. The team of six Royal Engineers began their work on 3 October 1864. The work was completed on 16 June 1865, and the report was published on 29 March 1866.Ordnance Survey, pp. 1, 2, 16 During the resulting search, he produced \\"the first perfectly accurate map [of Jerusalem], even in the eyes of modern cartography\\", and identified the eponymous Wilson's Arch but was unable to find a new source of water. Over a century after the survey, Dan Bahat described it as \\"a watershed in the exploration of Jerusalem and its past\\", and The Jerusalem Post commented that Wilson's efforts \\"served as the basis for all future Jerusalem research\\". The survey provided the foundation and impetus for the creation of the Palestine Exploration Fund. The first meeting of the Fund took place on 22 June 1865, less than a week after the completion of the Ordnance Survey, and Charles Wilson was appointed by the Fund as the Chief Director of their proposed exploration of the rest of Palestine.Ordnance Survey, p.2-3 In July 1866 Dean Stanley described the Ordnance Survey as a \\"sort of pre-historic stage of our Palestine Exploration Fund\\". It was the most influential and reliable map of Jerusalem until the British Mandate's Survey of Palestine, which published a 1:2,500 map of the Old City of Jerusalem in 1936.PALESTINE: ANNUAL REPORT, 1936, OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LANDS AND SURVEYS, Empire Survey Review, 4:28, 362-380, DOI: 10.1179/sre.1938.4.28.362, pages 368, 368: \\"In 1936 a complete map of the Old City of Jerusalem was published on the scale 1/2,500. The only previous map of the Old City was that made in 1865 by Sir Charles Wilson, previously mentioned. This map is apparently often called by writers the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem! Anyhow, it proved itself worthy of the title, for Lieut-Col F. J. Salmon states that it was sufficiently accurate to be used as the framing of the new map. The old map showed no more than the streets and principal edifices; the new shows all the structures‚Ä¶ Large-scale maps were also undertaken, including a 1/2,500 plan of the Old City of Jerusalem, previously mentioned. Provisional plans of Jerusalem and environs, on a scale of 1/5,000, were drawn and printed, though the survey was held up by the disturbances to a degree which is obviously not overestimated. These will subsequently be reduced to 1/10,000-a general map in demand for the city.\\" History The survey was catalyzed by an 1864 petition from Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (the Dean of Westminster), representing a committee which included the Bishop of London Archibald Campbell Tait to George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon (the Secretary of State for War). Dean Stanley had accompanied the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) on his 1862 trip to Jerusalem; his request was for an improvement to the city's water supply. The cost of providing the Royal Engineers surveyors (Wilson and his team) was covered by the British Government's War Office. The introduction to the survey stated that the ‚Ç§500 cost of the survey was funded by the wealthy Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts, whose primary motivation was to find better drinking water for those living in the city. However, the issue of ‚Äúwater relief‚Äù to the city was subsequently sidelined; in the words of Moscrop ‚Äúthe issue just vanishes,‚Äù and no improvements were made to the water supply until the end of the century. Haram Ash Sharif As Austen Henry Layard made clear at the first public meeting of the PEF on 22 June 1865, the Ordnance Survey had been conducted ‚Äúunder the auspices of the War Department and with the sanction of the Government‚Äù Legacy One of the survey's most significant aspects was that it was the first work to investigate the underground features of the Temple Mount (referred to in the survey as the Haram As-Sharif), such as its cisterns, channels and aqueducts. Archaeologist Shimon Gibson summed up the legacy of the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem as follows (underline added): > What is quite clear is that a major change in the character of the > exploration of ancient Jerusalem occurred in the 19th century, with a > fascination for the past of the city, fanciful or otherwise, being replaced > by that of a scientific concern for the tangible antiquities of the city. > _The Ordnance Survey conducted by Wilson in 1864 and 1865 marks this turning > point._ The ancient past of Jerusalem was no longer a matter for armchair > scholarly discourse, turning upon the credibility and background of a given > scholar, but had now become a matter for clear-cut scientific rigor, which > could only be based on facts obtained in empirical fashion, whether through > the taking of exact measurements, photography, or excavations in the ground. The names of streets, buildings and points of interest were collected by Carl Sandreczki of the Church Mission Society and two assistants. Sandreczki's list, which included the names written in Arabic, is an invaluable resource as it contains many items that have otherwise been lost.

The surface of the M√©tabetchoune River (except the rapids zones) is usually frozen from the end of November to the beginning of April, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to the end of March.  Geography  The main watersheds neighboring the M√©tabetchouane Est river are: * north side: M√©tabetchouane River, Rivi√®re aux √âcorces du Milieu; * east side: Cav√©e River, Launi√®re River; * south side: Liane stream, Rivi√®re de la Place, M√©tabetchouane River, Jacques-Cartier River; * west side: M√©tabetchouane River, Br√ªl√© Lake. The M√©tabetchouane Est River takes its source at the mouth of \\"Lac des Hautes des Terres\\" (length: ; altitude: ). Enclosed between mountains, this lake is linked on the north side by a small stream with the \\"Lac de la Hauteur\\" which turns out to be the head lake of the rivi√®re aux √âcorces du Milieu. The mouth of \\"Lac des Hauts des Terres\\" is located: south of the source of the source of rivi√®re aux √âcorces du Milieu, at northwest of Lac Chagnon, northeast of Lac Tentant and northeast. From its source, the course of the M√©tabetchouane East river descends on , with a drop of , according to the following segments: Upper course of the M√©tabetchouane East River (from its source) (segment of ) * southwards crossing on Lake Mousseau, then Lake Aramis, to the outlet (coming from the north-west) from Lakes Athos and Porthos; * to the south, forming a large S, up to the outlet (coming from the east) of Lac Bourbier; * towards the west by forming a hook towards the south and meandering, until the outlet (coming from the southwest) of lakes Fretin, Tentant and Petit lac Tentant; * north-east, to the outlet (coming from the north-east) from Lake Sigma; * to the west, collecting the outlet (coming from the south) from Lac des Margouilies, and branching northwest to the Gratia stream (coming from the north); * south-east, then south by collecting the discharge (coming from the east) from Badaillac, Lime and Fr√™le lakes, to the north shore of Missip lake; Intermediate course of the M√©tabetchouane East river (segment of ) * to the west, sometimes winding and collecting the discharge (coming from the south-east) from the Nourrains and Bocage lakes; * south-west, then north-west, up to Maria stream (coming from the north); * north-west, up to a bend in the river; * south-west, to the outlet (coming from the north-west) from lakes Boisseau, Dunoyon and √âtang Florissant; Lower course of the M√©tabetchouane Est river (segment of ) * first on towards the south-west in a deep valley up to a bend of the river; then on towards the south-east, then the south-west, up to the Liane stream (coming from the south-east); * towards the southwest by forming a large S, crossing a few series of rapids then forming a loop towards the southeast, until the outlet (coming from the north) from the Lake Raidillon; * to the southwest by forming serpentines at the end of the segment near a marsh area, until it meets the M√©tabetchouane River (coming from the southeast). From the confluence of the M√©tabetchouane East river, the current descends the M√©tabetchouane North River on to the south shore of lac Saint-Jean; from there, the current crosses the latter on towards the northeast, then borrows the course of the Saguenay River via La Petite Landfill on until Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.

CUT&Tag-sequencing; combines antibody-targeted controlled cleavage by a protein A-Tn5 fusion with massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify the binding sites of DNA- associated proteins. It can be used to map global DNA binding sites precisely for any protein of interest. Currently, ChIP-Seq is the most common technique utilized to study protein‚ÄìDNA relations, however, it suffers from a number of practical and economical limitations that CUT&RUN; and CUT&Tag; sequencing do not. CUT&Tag; sequencing is an improvement over CUT&RUN; because it does not require cells to be lysed or chromatin to be fractionated. CUT&RUN; is not suitable for single-cell platforms so CUT&Tag; is advantageous for these. Uses CUT&Tag-sequencing; can be used to examine gene regulation or to analyze transcription factor and other chromatin-associated protein binding. Protein-DNA interactions regulate gene expression and are responsible for many biological processes and disease states. This epigenetic information is complementary to genotype and expression analysis. CUT&Tag; is an alternative to the current standard of ChIP-seq. ChIP-Seq suffers from limitations due to the cross linking step in ChIP-Seq protocols that can promote epitope masking and generate false-positive binding sites. As well, ChIP-seq suffers from suboptimal signal-to-noise ratios and poor resolution. CUT&Run-sequencing; and CUT&Tag; have the advantage of being simpler techniques with lower costs due to the high signal-to-noise ratio, requiring less depth in sequencing. Specific DNA sites in direct physical interaction with proteins such as transcription factors can be isolated by Protein-A (pA) conjugated Tn5 bound to a protein of interest. Tn5 mediated cleavage produces a library of target DNA sites bound to a protein of interest in situ. Sequencing of prepared DNA libraries and comparison to whole-genome sequence databases allows researchers to analyze the interactions between target proteins and DNA, as well as differences in epigenetic chromatin modifications. Therefore, the CUT&Tag; method may be applied to proteins and modifications, including transcription factors, polymerases, structural proteins, protein modifications, and DNA modifications. =Sequencing= Unlike ChIP-Seq there is no size selection required before sequencing. A single sequencing run can scan for genome-wide associations with high resolution, due to the low background achieved by performing the reaction in situ with the CUT&RUN-sequencing; methodology. ChIP-Seq, by contrast, requires ten times the sequencing depth because of the intrinsically high background associated with the method. The data is then collected and analyzed using software that aligns sample sequences to a known genomic sequence to identify the CUT&Tag; DNA fragments. = Protocols = There are detailed CUT&Tag; workflows available in an open-access methods repository. * CUT&Tag; for efficient epigenomic profiling of small samples and single cells * CUT&Tag; for efficient epigenomic profiling of small samples and single cells Sensitivity CUT&Run-Sequencing; or CUT&Tag-Sequencing; provide low levels of background signal because of in situ profiling which retains in vivo 3D confirmations of transcription factor-DNA interactions, so antibodies access only exposed surfaces. Sensitivity of sequencing depends on the depth of the sequencing run (i.e. the number of mapped sequence tags), the size of the genome and the distribution of the target factor. The sequencing depth is directly correlated with cost and negatively correlated with background. Therefore, low-background CUT&Tag; sequencing is inherently more cost-effective than high-background ChIP-Sequencing.

Note That CUT&RUN; and CUT&Tag; appears to deliver improved signal-to-noise ratio than traditional ChIP.

Breen, and co-created by Jennifer Monier-Williams. The series premiered on January 19, 2020 on Universal Kids. This series is produced by HappyAnimation and Brown Bag Films.  Premise  The series follows Max with his pet parakeets, Ace and Polly. Max counts on them to keep saving the day while he is away. The powerbirds save the city from danger and they stop the main villains: Nibbles, Clawdette, Scrapper, Minerva, and Asher Stasher from the events that Max will be going to later, so then later, Max is excited to visit the events.  Characters  = Main = * Ace (voice of Cory Doran) is a yellow parakeet who can turn into a superhero when trouble calls. He is determined, daring, and playful. When he's not fighting bad guys, he loves everything related to superheroes, and he's a food loving bird. * Polly (voice of Tara Strong) is a blue parakeet who can also turn into a superhero like Ace. She is a very silly and creative bird, and can think outside of the box to solve problems. She has extra powers like super stretching herself that Ace doesn‚Äôt have. = Supporting = * Max (voice of Orlando Lucas) is an imaginative eight-year-old who owns Polly and Ace. He loves comic books that are about superheroes and counts on Ace and Polly to make sure no danger is around the city when he is away, despite him not seeing them saving the day like the other humans can. * Gwen (voice of Ana Sani) is Max‚Äôs Little Sister who sometimes plays with him before they both leave to wherever they‚Äôre going and would usually play as another character in his superhero games. * Mrs. Lopez (voice of Paloma Nu√±ez) is a bookmobile driver who speaks in a Hispanic accent. * Grandpa Felix (voice of Deven Mack) is Max‚Äôs grandfather who would appear in some episodes prior to the mission and the lesson one of the Powerbirds must remember. These episodes are ‚ÄúTime to Dino-soar‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Powerbirds Pretender‚Äù, ‚ÄúMidnight Scrap‚Äù, ‚ÄúWacky Wokka Walk‚Äù, and ‚ÄúScrapper‚Äôs Magnet Mayhem‚Äù. = Villains = * Nibbles (voice of Rob Tinkler) is a dog who tries to gain attention to become famous but ends up causing disasters, mostly because he only thinks of himself and doesn‚Äôt know why the famous people are loved. He speaks in a British accent. * Clawdette (voice of Evany Rosen) is Max‚Äôs cat and The Powerbirds‚Äô adoptive sister. She believes that she is the best ninja, so she tries to get stuff so she can be the best at it. In \\"Power Meower Saves the Day\\", she actually helped Polly and Ace by wearing out Asher Stasher and she helps them again in \\"Food Caper\\" when Scrapper was stealing the cat food for himself to eat. * Scrapper (voice of Tyler Muree) is a raccoon that likes to try to steal all other people's food, especially his favorite, pizzas. He seems to be the least villainous of them because all he wants is food. He speaks in a New York accent. * Minerva (voice of Shannon Hamilton) is an owl who uses different tools to cause trouble such as bad dream bubbles, magic mirrors, consoles, and more to get herself smarter then the humans are. * Asher Stasher (voice of Cory Doran) is a squirrel that tries to collect stuff for his \\"collection of shiny things\\", but sometimes wants stuff that is too big and decides that he either doesn‚Äôt want it anyway or gets interrupted by a phone call from his mom.  Episodes  The series has been picked up for 20 22-minute episodes.http://www.thecomposerworks.com/news/powerbirds/ It premiered early on its original network for its first look of the show on January 1, 2020.  Production  Universal Pictures has chosen to make a TV series out of Breen's children's books, which are published by Penguin, include Stick, Violet the Pilot, Pug and Doug, Unicorn Executions and Skyhorse, and the choice was Powerbirds. Universal Kids planned the series in 2017, but with a different style, before Sprout‚Äôs rebrand to Universal Kids, a different style of the characters, which was Max, Polly, Ace and another character, the Golden Eagle. 9 Story Media Group's live-action and animation division co-produced the series with animators from Brown Bag Films.  Reception  Universal Kids stated Hollywood Life that \\"The series promotes underlying positive messages that we can all be our own superhero if we do the right thing.‚Äù  Release  In 2017, Universal Kids, as Sprout, set a release date for Powerbirds in 2019, but on December 11, 2019, the show was delayed to a 2020 release date instead to January 19, 2020, and the show got a first look release on January 1, 2020.

Description Sympyotrichum patens is a small (up to ~1m height) herbaceous plant with a spreading growth form. The leaves are ovate to oblong, clasping the pubescent stem. The flowers are relatively small, less than in diameter, with light blue to violet petals and yellow centers. It flowers between August and October. Taxonomy The genus Symphyotrichum includes some 90 species that are often highly similar. The title of a review of the Symphyotrichum patens complex begins with \\"Another review...\\" as a nod to the complexity of the topic. The species was first formally described as Aster patens in 1789. It was transferred to the genus Symphyotrichum in 1995 by Guy L. Nesom. It is closely related to Symphyotrichum georgianum and Symphyotrichum phlogifolium. Several varieties have been named: *Symphyotrichum patens var. patens *Symphyotrichum patens var. gracile (Hook.)

This conflict was the last phase of armed indigenous resistance against French rule in the Society Islands, which began in 1843 with the forcible imposition of a protectorate over the Kingdom of Tahiti in the Franco-Tahitian War. The three Leeward Islands kingdoms were ensured independence by the Jarnac Convention, a joint agreement signed between France and Great Britain in 1847. Continual instability in the native regimes and the growing threat of the nascent German colonial empire in the Pacific prompted France to declare the islands under a provisional protectorate in 1880, in violation of the 1847 Convention. In 1888, France and Britain agreed to abrogate their previous treaty and allow the French to annex the Leeward Islands. From 1888 to 1897, the Leeward Island natives resisted the French while civil wars also broke out between pro-French factions and the majority anti-French sectors of the population. Armed conflict began in 1887 with the revolt of the chief Teraupo'o on Raiatea against the pro-French king and the shooting of a French officer and marines on Huahine. The natives of Huahine set up a rival royal government under Queen Teuhe to resist the pro-French factions under her brother Prince Marama Teururai. The resistance was strongest on Raiatea and Tahaa where the chief Teraupo'o and his followers entrenched themselves in the countryside and the mountains and sought British intervention in the war. The conflict ended with the violent suppression of the Raiatean rebellion and the exile of the rebels in 1897.  Name  The conflict has been referred to by a variety of names. Historian John Dumore referred to the conflict as the \\"Leewards War\\" in 1997. Historian Matt K. Matsuda noted in Empire of Love: Histories of France and the Pacific, \\"Struggles in Huahine, Bora Bora, and Raiatea continued over decades as the 'Leewards War,' little remembered in French Pacific scholarship.\\" The Historical Dictionary of Polynesia called the conflict, the \\"Teraupo'o War\\" or the \\"War of Teraupo'o\\" after the Raiatean resistance leader Teraupo'o. French school teacher Paul Huguenin, who authored Raiatea La Sacr√©e, a 1902 book on Raiatea's history and traditions, referred to the conflict as the Conqu√™te des Iles sous le Vent. Auguste Charles Eug√®ne Caillot, author of Les Polynesiens Orientaux Au Contact de la Civilisation (1909), referred to the conflict as la guerre de Raiatea-Tahaa. Pierre-Yves Toullelan, author of the article ‚ÄúLe colonialisme triomphant: Tahiti et la IIIe R√©publique\\" (1990), referred to the conflict as \\"la guerre des √Æles Sous-le-Vent\\". Alexandre Juster, author of L'histoire de la Polyn√©sie fran√ßaise en 101 dates (2016), refers to the conflict as \\"la guerre des Iles sous le Vent\\".  Background  =Prelude= Topographic map of the Leeward Islands The Society Islands are subdivided into the Leeward Islands in the northwest and Windward Islands or Georgian Islands in the southeast. The Windward Islands include Tahiti, Moorea, Mehetia, Tetiaroa and Maiao. Politically, the Kingdom of Tahiti comprised all the Windward Islands except Maiao and also held nominal sovereignty over the more distant Tuamotus archipelago and a few of the Austral Islands. By the mid-19th century the Leeward Islands was made up of three kingdoms: the Kingdom of Huahine and its dependency of Maiao (geographically part of the Windward Islands); the Kingdom of Raiatea-Tahaa, and the Kingdom of Bora Bora with its dependencies of Maupiti, Tupai, Maupihaa, Motu One, and Manuae. Tahiti was converted to Protestant Christianity by the London Missionary Society (LMS) in the early 19th century. The P≈çmare Dynasty, patrons of the British Protestant missionaries, established their rule over Tahiti and Moorea as part of the Kingdom of Tahiti. Western concepts of kingdoms and nation states were foreign to the native Tahitians or Maohi, people who were divided into loosely defined tribal units and districts before European contact. The first Christian king, P≈çmare II headed the hau pahu rahi (\\"government of the great drum\\") or hau feti'i (\\"family government\\"), a traditional alliance of the inter-related chiefly families of the Society Islands. Christianity spread to the remaining islands after his conversion. He held nominal suzerainty over the other Society Islands. This was later misinterpreted by Europeans as sovereignty or subjugation of the other islands to Tahiti. In the 1830s and 1840s, tensions between French naval interests, the British settlers and pro-British native chieftains on Tahiti led to the Franco-Tahitian War (1844‚Äì1847) and the voluntary exile of Queen P≈çmare IV to Raiatea. Tahitian guerilla resistance on Tahiti was forcibly stamped out by the French administration with the capture of Fort Fautaua. Attempts to forcefully incorporate the neighbouring kingdoms of the Leeward Islands (west of Mo'orea) ceased following increased diplomatic pressure from Great Britain, and after a French expeditionary force was defeated on Huahine by Queen Teriitaria II in 1846. In February 1847, Queen P≈çmare IV returned from her exile and acquiesced to rule under the protectorate government centered in Papeete. Although victorious, the French were unable to annex the islands due to diplomatic pressure from Great Britain, so Tahiti and its dependency of Moorea continued to be ruled under the French protectorate. The Jarnac Convention or the Anglo-French Convention of 1847 was also signed by the French and the British, in which both powers agreed to respect the independence of Huahine, Raiatea, and Bora Bora. =Period of independence= For the next four decades, the three northern kingdoms remained nominally independent from the French in Papeete and remained strongly pro-British because of the influence of the LMS missionaries who remained stationed on the islands. However, economic and political instabilities were continual threats. Although Bora Bora remained politically stable, decades of political unrest plagued the islands of Huahine, Raiatea and Tahaa. The adoption of a British parliamentary system of government eroded the traditional supremacy of the ari'i rahi (\\"supreme rulers\\") in favor of the ra'atira (\\"freeman\\") class. Local chiefs and district governors (tƒÅvana) gained greater power and autonomy at the expense of the nominal island monarchs. On Huahine, the warrior queen Teriitaria II was deposed in 1852 and her successor Ari'imate was deposed in 1868. On Raiatea, King Tamatoa IV was deposed in 1853 and later recalled. His successor Tamatoa V of Raiatea was deposed for the first time in 1858 and again in 1871. The next king, Tahitoe, who was one of the district governors, was deposed in 1881 for aligning with the French.; ; ; LMS missionary and acting British consul on Raiatea, Alexander Chisholm, declared, \\"The foolish people seem determined to prove to the whole world that they cannot govern themselves.\\" Externally, the island governments feared intervention from the French in each succession crisis and the encroachment of other colonial powers. In 1858, the American consul in Raiatea unsuccessfully attempted to declare a protectorate over or annex Raiatea and Tahaa to the United States. In the late 1870s, there were worries that the German Empire would also incorporate the islands through annexation or a protectorate as part of its nascent colonial empire in the Pacific. The proposed Panama Canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific also increased the value of territorial claims in the Pacific. Huahine signed a treaty of friendship with Germany in May 1879, which was never ratified by the German government. On Tahiti, King P≈çmare V abdicated on 29 June 1880 and the Tahitian kingdom was annexed to France. Internal warfare and introduced diseases, such as dysentery, scarlet fever, measles, whooping cough and typhoid, contributed to a general decline of native populations after European contact. The native population of the Leeward Islands numbered around 5,000 to 6,000 people throughout much of the mid and late 19th century. In 1897, a census of the Leeward Islands recorded: 1,237 people on Huahine, 2,138 people on Raiatea, 1,099 people on Tahaa, 1,264 people on Bora Bora, and 536 on Maupiti. The more isolated Maiao had a sporadic population and numbered less than 100 people by 1871. The 1897 the populations of Tahiti and Moorea were around 10,000 and 1,500 respectively and had decreased in the same period between the 1880s and 1890s. Australian demographer Norma McArthur noted that: \\"If a mission estimate (Cooper, 1884b) of 'about 5,500' people in the Leeward Islands in 1884 was reasonable, the population had increased by nearly 1,000 by 1897, and this represents an average annual increase of about 1¬Ω percent.\\" However, the exact percentage of population growth due to births versus immigration is hard to determine.  Annexation of the Leeward Islands  Responding to the growing threat of Germany in the Pacific, the French took actions to abrogate the Convention of 1847 and bring the Leeward Islands into their sphere of influence. In 1880 French Commissioner Isidore Chess√© convinced the islanders of the growing German threat and urged them to request for French protection. In Raiatea (see below), King Tahitoe and his chiefs signed a request for French protection and hoisted the protectorate flag on 9 April 1880. Chess√© was unable to convince Huahine and Bora Bora to sign similar agreements. Avera, The imposition of the French protectorate on the Leeward Islands was initially disavowed by the minister of foreign affairs, Jules Barth√©lemy-Saint-Hilaire, and the French government. Commercial groups in Hamburg and Berlin protested the actions of the French, but the British Foreign Office was less ambivalent, seeing a French takeover as a foregone conclusion, and was open to negotiations. A provisional protectorate was established as France and Great Britain re-negotiated the details of the Jarnac Convention. Speculations included the French concessions in the Pacific or West Africa or the cession of fishing rights in the French Shore off Newfoundland. The convention was finally abrogated in exchange for French military concessions in the New Hebrides. The Convention relating to the New Hebrides and the Leeward islands of Tahiti was signed at Paris on 16 November 1887 and the Declaration for the Abrogation of the Declaration of the 19th June, 1847, between Great Britain and France concerning the Islands to the leeward of Tahiti was signed at Paris on 30 May 1888. News of the change reach Papeete in the beginning of 1888, allowing the French annexation of the islands. After the removal of this diplomatic obstacle, Governor Th√©odore Lacascade officially annexed all of the Leeward Islands on 16 March 1888 via proclamation. The Proclamation de Gouverneur aux habitant des √éles sous le Vent √† l'occasion de l'annexion de ces √Æles √† la France was done without documents of cession from the former sovereign government of the islands. Lacascade traveled to the Leeward Islands to proclaim the annexation. The mission was accompanied by the French naval warship Decr√®s, under the command of Captain Alfred Charles Marie La Guerre, and the schooner Aorai, under the command of Captain Louis Marie Reux. Lacascade with other French officials and naval officers took possessions of the islands and raised the flag of France on Huahine (16 March), Raiatea (17 March) and Bora Bora (19 March). The annexation was nominal and native autonomy and resistance continued on the islands for another decade. = Raiatea = In 1880, King Tahitoe accepted the provisional protectorate by Chess√© and raised the protectorate flag of Raiatea with the French tricolour on its canton. Captain Mervyn B. Medlycott of the corvette HMS Turquoise ordered French Lieutenant F√©lix Marie Salaun de Kertanguy, of the war schooner Oroh√©na, to lower the protectorate flag, and in its place the Raiatean flag was hoisted and accorded a royal salute. According to Guy Hardy Scholefield, \\"The French flag was permitted to be rehoisted provisionally on 25 May 1881, for periods of six months, the discussion being renewed from time to time.\\" Tahitoe was deposed by his subjects for requesting the protectorate. His daughter and successor, Queen Tehauroa, unsuccessfully attempted to enlist the protection of the British to preserve Raiatea's independence in accordance with the Jarnac Convention. On 17 March 1888, Governor Lacascade took possession of Raiatea and Tahaa and raised the French flag. On 25 September 1887, five chiefs of Raiatea petitioned Papeete to send a French resident administrator. Teraupo'o, a lesser chief of Raiatea known for his fierce opposition to the French, refused to comply with the order of King Tamatoa VI to surrender to them and built up a resistance force. The following year, King Tamatoa VI, originally from the royal family of Huahine, abdicated to avoid being used by the French and returned to Huahine to become a tƒÅvana. In his place, Teraupo'o led the native resistance against the French and installed a resistance government under Tuarii (a younger daughter of Tahitoe) as queen at Avera. The French established themselves at the former capital of Uturoa and appointed a r√©sident, Marie Maximilien Gustave Alby. The French also had the support of the chief Tavana, a former minister of Tamatoa who held the title of viceroy of Raiatea-Tahaa. A prolonged war prevented the French from entering the rural areas of Raiatea as the natives resorted to guerilla warfare.; ; The pa or the military camp of Teraupo'o, 1897 The Raiateans unsuccessfully appealed to Robert Teesdale Simons, the British consul in Tahiti, for assistance and offered their country to the \\"Great White Queen\\". In 1895, Queen Tuarii traveled to the British protectorate Rarontonga to seek help from the British resident, Frederick Moss, who refused to meet with her. Attempts were made to mediate the conflict by Consul Simons and Tati Salmon, an Anglo-Tahitian businessman of royal descent. The French Protestant missionary Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Vernier, former chaplain of Queen P≈çmare IV, also attempted unsuccessfully to sway the natives. Pastor Gaston Brunel, who took charge of the Protestant schools on the island in 1894 and was largely sympathetic to the natives, often visited the camp of the resistance leader and gained valuable insight into the rebellion. French artist Paul Gauguin, who witnessed the final phase of the rebellion, noted that diplomacy failed to persuade the natives of Raiatea to surrender. Gauguin also witnessed the 1896 expedition to Raiatea. The French appointed Governor Gustave Gallet to defeat the entrenched rebellion by military force. Gallet had previous experience with suppressing the 1878 Kanak rebellion in New Caledonia. In 1896, two French warships, the cruiser and the transporter arrived from New Caledonia with two hundred French soldiers to quell the native resistance under the command of Captain Charles Jess√© Bayle and Captain Paul Louis Albert Chocheprat, respectively. The invasion force was reinforced further with a company of Tahitian volunteers. On 27 December 1896, Governor Gallet attempted to parley with the rebels to avoid bloodshed. He set an ultimatum for the rebels to surrender by 1 January 1897. The rebel government at Avera under Queen Tuarii and 1,700 rebels reluctantly surrendered. Teraupo'o and the rebels of Tahaa and the district of Tevaitoa refused the call, prompting the French to land and engage the remaining armed natives. The French routed the under-equipped and disorganized native forces and many fled into the mountains to escape capture. The armed native resistance ended with the capture of the leading chief, Teraupo'o, on 15‚Äì16 February 1897. The casualties of the six- week campaign were nearly fifty deaths mainly on the side of the Raiateans. The captured resistance leaders, including Teraupo'o, his wife, his brother and lieutenant Hupe, the chiefess Mai of Tevaitoa and six other men, were deported to Noum√©a, New Caledonia. Their followers were exiled to the island of Ua Huka in the Marquesas Islands, while others were conscripted as forced laborers to improve the roads of Raiatea. = Huahine = The natives resisted the French on Huahine. Governor Lacascade took possession and raised the French flag over Huahine on 16 March 1888. A week later, on 21 March, Captain La Guerre, of the Decr√®s, landed a small party of French marines to arrest insurgents on Huahine on the way back to Tahiti. In retaliation, the natives killed the ship's ensign Louis D√©not, who was leading the detachment, and two marines and wounded five others. This marked the first bloodshed in the war of the Leeward Islands since Lacascade's annexation. Ebenezer Vicessimus Cooper, the last LMS missionary in the Society Islands, was an observer of the conflict. He noted that the French acquisition had \\"long been a foregone conclusion\\" to foreign residents, but it met with the \\"determined opposition of more than three-fourths of the natives\\" on Huahine. The elderly queen Tehaapapa II and her son Prince-Regent Marama Teururai, who held the governmental position of Fa'aterehau or Prime Minister, accepted the French takeover. However, the anti-French forces rallied around Queen Teuhe, Marama's sister and former wife of P≈çmare V, and set up a parallel rebel government from 1888 to 1890. This civil war continued until the nationalist forces were defeated by the forces of Tehaapapa II. Cooper noted that \\"their Christianity under existing circumstances [was] nothing more than a name\\". He was banned from preaching for trying to prevent hostile native prayer-meetings for the defeat and destruction of the French. As the last the LMS missionary, Cooper left Huahine and care of the Society Islands to the missionaries of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society in 1890. Queen Tehaapapa II and her government formally requested a French protectorate on 30 July 1890. The royal government of Huahine persisted for five more years and Tehaapapa II was succeeded by her granddaughter Tehaapapa III in 1893. Historian Pierre-Yves Toullelan noted that Huahine did not lay down its arms until 1894. The anti-French nationalist factions remained a threat, and the queen asked for military assistance from the French on 14 January 1895. On 11 September 1895, the young queen and the native government formally ceded \\"forever and without reserve, the government of their country to France.\\" Governor Pierre Papinaud accepted the cession and imposed a permanent administration on Huahine. = Bora Bora = The militia of Bora Bora, 1895 Bora Bora and its dependencies were nominally annexed on 19 March 1888 by Governor Lacascade. Traditionally, Boraborans were regarded as the most warlike people of the archipelago. LMS missionary William Edward Richards wrote in 1888 that the Boraborans \\"were strongly opposed to the [French] flag, and it was feared that blood would be shed\\" but that they wisely appreciated their weakness and lack of \\"mountain strongholds\\", and \\"gradually settl[ed] down with bad grace into the inevitable\\". The islands were also recovering from a recent civil war between Bora Bora and secessionist forces in Maupiti in 1876. Toullelan noted that Bora Bora did not lay down its arms until 1894 but provided no details.; Par des tractations sans fin, il parvient √† faire d√©poser les armes √† Huahine (1893), √† Bora Bora (1894). Bora Bora remained neutral during the conflicts of Raiatea which prevented the French from administering their new acquisition until September 1895. Through the persuasion of her ex-husband Prince Hinoi, Queen Teriimaevarua III accepted French administration and formally abdicated on 21 September 1895. Retaining her honor as queen, she was allowed to collect tributes from the outlying northern islands and was provided with a pension by the colonial government. A French vice-resident and later a gendarme was placed in charge of the islands, but they retained native laws and government for a few more years. In an ironic gesture of defiance, the islanders appointed a blind man to the office of French flag raiser. In 1898 the former queen, Teriimaevarua III, attempted to incite a new resistance movement in the islands and was exiled to Tahaa by the order Governor Gallet on 27 October 1898.  Aftermath  After the capture of Teraupo'o, the Chamber of Deputies in Paris proclaimed \\"the victorious end of the last military campaign in our islands\\". The Chamber ratified annexation on 19 November 1897. The Code de l'indig√©nat or Native Code was imposed by the French to administer the Leeward Islanders as French subjects rather than French citizens. Native courts and judges were retained, except with regard to land legislation. European residents were tried under French law. The natives referred to the Indig√©nat system as hau tamaru (\\"protectorate government\\") in contrast with the hau farani (\\"French government\\"). Tahiti was not under the Indig√©nat system, but was ruled more directly by France under the French judicial system. The Native Code was not repealed until 1946. By 1901, with the annexation of the last independent monarchies of Rimatara and Rurutu in the Austral Islands, the French Establishment of Oceania was formed. The five archipelagoes of the Society Islands, the Tuamotus, Austral Islands, Gambier Islands and Marquesas Islands were incorporated into the territory of French Oceania, which are today part of the overseas collectivity of French Polynesia. The French Protestant missionaries helped to preserve the indigenous language and culture of the islanders and the Maohi Protestant Church was later established to preserve the legacy of the indigenous and Protestant identity of the Society Islands.

Both he and his partner Dennis Carter, with whom he founded Smith Carter, were, according to Jeffrey Thorsteinson, among several \\"significant modern architects\\" who graduated from the University of Manitoba's architecture program prior to 1946, and who were \\"vital to the rise of a notable regional strain of Canadian architecture\\" referred to as Manitoba modernism. Architectural historian Kelly Crossman remarks that in the 1950s Manitoba architectural firms \\"consistently ranked among the best in the country\\" and that the provincial capitol Winnipeg \\"played a significant role as an early centre of architectural modernism in Canada\\", identifying Smith Carter as one of two \\"especially\\" important Winnipeg design firms. Their work included \\"major projects, public and private.\\" One of the most \\"prolific and influential\\" design firms in Winnipeg, they earned a reputation in the 1950s and 1960s for \\"slick, understated, lucid, refined and experimental architecture keyed directly into site and landscape\\" which \\"changed the urban character\\" of the city. Early life and education Ernest Smith was born on 17 December 1919 in Winnipeg, and grew up in the neighbourhood of Wolseley, on Aubrey Street. Smith studied architecture at the University of Manitoba, described as \\"notably progressive\\" at the time. He won the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada Gold Medal, and a postgraduate fellowship to attend the MIT, where he earned a Master of Architecture degree. While at MIT, Smith became interested in large project planning and housing developments, attending seminars by \\"leading experts in the field,\\" including Catherine Bauer Wurster and Charles Abrams. Smith finished his thesis in September 1947 and came home to honour a commitment he made with fellow alumni Dennis Carter (another RAIC Gold Medal winner) and Walter Katelnikoff that they three would start their own firm upon his return to Winnipeg. Career =Foundation (1947‚Äì1959)= The business partnership was initially formed as Smith Carter Katelnikoff with offices on 289¬Ω Garry Street. Smith also taught design at the University of Manitoba while the practice was being established. Smith Carter Katelnikoff made their name locally with the 1948 renovation of their own offices on Portage Avenue East and, due to the demand created by Winnipeg's expanding population in the 1950s, several schools. At the same time, the firm grew on the strength of commissions for large schools in rural Manitoba and Western Canada where modern centralized facilities were replacing one-room schools. Smith served as the managing partner of the firm (which had various names and partners through the years) for thirty-eight years until his retirement in 1985. In the 1950s, as the firm's commissions grew, attention was increasingly paid to interiors and the selection of materials suitable for the local culture and climate. The firm designed Canada's longest running venue for outdoor theatre, Rainbow Stage (1951‚Äì1953). In 1953 and 1954, Smith acted as president of the Manitoba Association of Architects, and again from 1956 to 1961. Around this time, Smith designed his family home. Westworth United Church One of Smith's personally significant projects from this period is Westworth United Church (1958-1959), consisting of two major additions to an education building (a gymnasium) designed by Green Blankstein Russell in 1950. The additions, a central narthex and towering sanctuary, needed to \\"tie in with the existing building and yet give the sanctuary a dominating position.\\" The church includes large stained-glass windows by Leo Mol (1959). =Scaling up (1959‚Äì1985)= The design and construction of the University of Manitoba's School of Architecture (1958‚Äì1959) won the firm a Massey Medal. Smith Carter were Massey Medal finalists for the Monarch Life Building (1959‚Äì1963; since 1999, the Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba Building), described as a \\"paragon of modernist order and dignity\\". The design team, led by Carter, sought to express \\"the bold confidence and security of the corporation, its concern for its clients and employees, as well as its commitment to the economic development of the city of Winnipeg.\\" Transformation of Portage and Main During the 1960s and 1970s, Smith served in a number of industry association senior positions, including president of the Manitoba Association of Architects (1956‚Äì1961) and chairman of the National Joint Committee on Construction Materials (1963‚Äì1965). He was dean of the College of Fellows of the RAIC from 1972 to 1975, and chancellor of the RAIC itself in 1979. Cluster of tall buildings in Downtown Winnipeg, near Portage and Main, from left to right: Commodity Exchange Tower, Canadian Grain Commission, and Richardson Building. Throughout the 1960s, the City of Winnipeg conducted transport studies which led to a rethinking of traffic flow through Portage Avenue and Main Street, the city's hub, and had Smith Carter conduct the transit forecast studies which concluded that mixing pedestrian and vehicular traffic would no longer be viable, ultimately leading to the construction of an underground concourse replacing the four sidewalks of the corner. Significant or large scale works during this period include the Canadian Wheat Board and Grain Commission buildings (1962 and 1970, respectively), the Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Canada buildings (1965 and 1971), the Pan Am Pool (1967), and the Manitoba Centennial Centre (1967‚Äì1972). One of the firm's most identifiable works from the period, and \\"one of the most identifiable landmarks of the city\\" is the Richardson Building (1967‚Äì1969; with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill as consulting architects), It forms the anchor of the Lombard Place development, which includes the Winnipeg Inn (1970, currently the Fairmont Hotel) and the underground concourse later connected to Trizec's Winnipeg Square shopping mall (1979) and the Commodity Exchange Tower (1974-1979, often referred to as the \\"Trizec Building\\" locally). Other large scale projects included the Woodsworth Building on Broadway (1973), The Great-West Life Assurance Company (1983), and the Air Canada building (1985). For a few years during this period (1969 to 1971), Smith Carter merged with Parkin Architects, thereby becoming, briefly, \\"the largest architectural and engineering concern in the country and the tenth largest in the world.\\" Canadian Grain Commission Building Smith, the principal architect of the Canadian Grain Commission, was also closely involved in the process of obtaining a suitable sculpture for its exterior (No. 1 Northern, bottom left). Nicknamed the \\"mushroom building\\", the structure itself is a \\"notable example\\" of a Canadian skyscraper displaying Brutalist elements. Smith was the principal architect of the Grain Commission building. Smith remarked on the challenges involved: > Mixing two different functions in a vertical building is difficult. Normally > construction would be separated horizontally. In this case, we worked out > two separate modules for offices and lab space, [and] found we needed > greater depth in the lab and rationalised the present form. The firm recommended a large scale exterior sculpture for the building, notifying Public Works Canada in June 1972. In April 1973, Smith met with the Regional Committee member, Kenneth Lochhead, and they \\"mutually agreed\\" that the building required a major contemporary work of art for the forecourt, determining a budget of $50,000, with Smith to follow up with a list of artists and in July 1974, a competition was proposed between ten invited artists. In January 1975, five artists, Henry Saxe, Ulysse Comtois, John Nugent, Ricardo Gomez, and Hugh Leroy, were chosen by Smith (with Kenneth Lochhead's advice). The Advisory Committee selected Nugent's No. 1 Northern, a large steel abstract sculpture intended as a metaphor for fields of wheat, represented in multi-layer rectangular shapes and painted the \\"brilliant\\" yellow of harvest wheat, designed by Nugent to represent Canada's hardy top grade, red spring wheat hybrid of the same name that dominate the Prairies in the fall. The work proved controversial after its installation in late 1975, with Earl Baxter, chairman of the Board of Grain Commissioners, leading a campaign in protest shortly after its unveiling, and by July 1978, they had prevailed: the work was dismantled and reinstalled two years later in front of a Revenue Canada building, only to be removed again in 1993. In 1997, almost twenty years after it was removed, Nugent's sculpture was reinstalled in front of the Grain Commission building. Entrance A late afternoon November sunset gives the Woodsworth Building a pink hue. Woodsworth Building Built for the Manitoba government between 1973 and 1976, the Woodsworth building is named after CCF reformer J.S. Wordsworth, a bust of whom, sculpted by Leo Mol, stands on the main floor. There is colourful artwork by Bruce Head, contrasting with the steel and glass of the building. Designed to be fifteen storeys, there was a civic debate over its height, and the final two storeys were not built until 1976. There was also considerable criticism when the skywalk to the Law Courts Building was constructed in 1974. Smith's original plan was for a tunnel, but the skywalk was chosen as the cheaper alternative. International work Smith was said to have been proudest of the firm's work shaping the Winnipeg skyline and of their work abroad, such the Kermanshah Technical Training Centre in Iran, the Canadian Embassy in Moscow and the Canadian Chancery in Warsaw (about 1965; all but foundations demolished in 2001). =Apex and final stages= Smith retired in 1985 and moved into a retirement home he designed himself, featured in an exhibition by the Royal Academy of Arts. Meanwhile, Smith Carter's reach extended to high- level biomedical research facilities. Early examples included the St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre (1986‚Äì1987) and the John Buhler Research Centre at the Health Sciences Centre (about 1990). The project considered to be \\"seminal\\" by Smith Carter was the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (1992‚Äì1998), one of only two Level 4 laboratories in Canada, establishing the firm as a leader in the design of highly secure laboratory facilities for disease research. Alongside Dennis Carter, his business partner of thirty-eight years, Ernest Smith was awarded an honorary life membership from the Manitoba Association of Architects in 2000. =Other pursuits and community activism= A supporter of the arts, Smith was a member of the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the Council of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, co- chairman of the Fine Arts Committee for the Centennial Cultural Centre, and the board of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, of which he was President from 1969‚Äì1971. Personal life =Smith residence= When his daughters Lynda and Emily were five years old and one year old respectively, Smith designed his family home in East Kildonan, off Kildonan Drive. The Drive is elevated as a protective flood dike, the house itself was built on land behind the flood dike and therefore quite low, requiring that the living spaces be elevated to the height of the street. The general plan, a strict rectangle with a central core appendage for entry along with a breezeway and garage on the north side of the house, keeps day- and night-time activities separate. Smith's design allowed the site to be kept at the natural grade: the main entry to the house's upper level is approached by a bridge, while the lower level plan is \\"at grade, which allows a ramped approach to the garage and garden access at the rear from the family room by sliding glass doors.\\" The ground level entry also eliminated the need for outside steps, which in Winnipeg must be kept clear of snow and ice in winter, the house levels split at this entry point into the upper level (living areas) and lower level (sewing, workshop and heating). Since the house is raised out of the ground, the lower leavel attains good light from an adequate depth of window. =Hillside Beach retirement home= Smith spent summers on Lake Winnipeg and at Grand Beach, where he first met his wife Marjorie, with whom he had three children. The retirement home he built in 1985 at Hillside Beach on Lake Winnipeg was featured at the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts \\"Prairie Region Exhibition\\" at the Winnipeg and Mackenzie art galleries in 1997 and 1998.

Dirk Postma. Background to foundation The congregation was founded in a climate of grave dissatisfaction by Rustenburg Voortrekkers with the state of the church in the South African Republic (ZAR). The Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NHK) was the only congregation in the town that was founded in 1850 and named for its inhabitants‚Äô relative safety from Bantu raids (it literally means ‚Äúcity of rest‚Äù in Afrikaans). The NHK Pastor was Rev. Dirk van der Hoff. The schismatics had tried several times to find a suitable preacher from the ranks of the Christian Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, ultimately succeeded with Rev. Postma‚Äôs dispatch. Arriving on July 9, 1858, in Simon‚Äôs Town and staying in Cape Town for a while, he arrived in Rustenburg at the end of the year. He was prepared to take the NHK mantle upon arrival, but on January 10, 1859, his 41st birthday, a general assembly of the NHK resolved themselves ‚Äúto adopt the Evangelical Hymnal in addition to the Psalms. An ecclesiastical organization, but also nothing more, we call for all to adopt our stance.‚Äù The Rev. Postma and many of his cohorts disagreed with the decision. Therefore, 15 male members of the congregation resolved on January 11, 1859, to separate from the NHK as the Reformed Church worshipping ‚Äúaccording to the doctrine, discipline, and service of forefathers such as those who revealed themselves at the Synod of Dort in 1618-1619.‚Äù Foundation On February 10, 1859, a general meeting was held by those dissatisfied with the NHK. Since Rev. Van der Hoff began refusing use of the Rustenburg NHK church, they had no place of worship and had to gather under a large chinaberry tree cut down in around 1970 after storm damage. The stump where the 300 charter members of the new congregation met has been declared a national heritage site. At the 11th service, Rev. Postma openly declared ‚Äúthe ministry of the Shepherd and Teacher incorporated in the Name and Power of the Lord.‚Äù Elders and deacons were elected and ordained thus, and the foundation of Rustenburg soon gave rise to other congregations in Pretoria and Potchefstroom. More congregations established Shortly afterward, Rev. Postma received petitions from around the Orange Free State and Cape Colony to join the GKSA. His visits in return helped spur the foundations of the Reddersburg Reformed Church (GKSA), the Burgersdorp Reformed Church (GKSA), the Colesberg Reformed Church (GKSA), and the Middelburg Reformed Church (Cape, GKSA), among others. Rev. Postma‚Äôs tenure The Rev. Postma served the congregation until 1866, though he served as spiritual leader of the entire denomination throughout Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and Cape Colony. Despite the schism, Rev. Postma and Rev. Van der Hoff retained a ‚Äúcourteous and fraternal‚Äù relationship. The animosity between the two churches therefore declined, though were in tension with the Dutch Reformed Church (NGK). In Transvaal, Rev. Postma guided the NHK through the end of state supervision, a move he initially opposed. As the ‚Äústate church,‚Äù the GKSA had to offset government tax funding, marriages could only be proclaimed therein and the license fees paid thereto, and only members had the right to vote. Even before the foundation of the Burgersdorp Theological School, Rev. Postma informally taught several pastors, including Jan Lion Cachet and future State Secretary of the South African Republic Nicolaas Swart. In 1866, Rev. Postma left for a post in the Burgersdorp congregation in the northeast of what is now Eastern Cape Province. He founded that congregation on January 21, 1860, in a store‚Äôs warehouse, given the lack of suitable meeting halls in a community hostile to Doppers (GKSA members); another source holds that it was founded on Roosterkoek farm near Albert, the nucleus of today‚Äôs town of Burgersdorp. This was the first GKSA congregation in Cape Colony. The Rev. Postma went there with the explicit aim of training ministers. The calmer political environment and wealthy surrounding congregations for funding assistance were among the factors influencing his choice. Rev. Jan Lion Cachet The Rev. Cachet was hired as catechism teacher in Ladysmith in Natal Colony on October 3, 1863 for ¬£25 a year and was considering a missionary career. This was against the backdrop of his 1862-1863 power struggle at the Cape Synods against liberal pastors J.J. Kotz√© and Thomas Fran√ßois Burgers, and his Transvaal-based brother‚Äôs conflict with Rev. Van der Hoff within the NHK. Ultimately, Rev. Cachet arrived in 1865 to join Rev. Postma and teach Hebrew and preparatory subjects to theological students. He moved with Rev. Postma to Burgersdorp in 1866. On May 13, 1868, one and a half years before the founding of the Theological School there, he wrote the proponent exam. The Rev. Cachet served Rustenburg from 1868 until 1869, when he was appointed co- pastor of Burgersdorp and preparatory lecturer at the school. He became acting Professor of Theology at the school in 1892 and official Professor as of the 1894 Synod, overseeing pastor training and serving as preparatory school rector. Revs. Du Plessis, De Ridder, and Postma, Jr. A three-year vacancy in the congregation came to an end when Rev. Louw du Plessis was ordained in 1872. The congregation lost population on April 15, 1875, when a large group of Doppers left for Portuguese Angola across the Kalahari Desert in what was known as the Dorsland Trek. In 1880, he left to serve the Colesberg congregation, founded by his father Izak David du Plessis and his mother Hester Venter on their Hamelfontein farm on December 8, 1860. His successor, Rev. Johannes de Ridder (1833-1896), who served as Rustenburg‚Äôs fourth pastor from 1880 to 1896, had arrived from the Netherlands in 1857-1858 as a young teacher. After taking the frock under the tutelage of Rev. Postma, he served in Rustenburg and Standterton, though he died in October 1896 shortly after his ordainment by the latter. Rustenburg‚Äôs fifth pastor was Rev. Dirk Postma, Jr., son of the founder. After serving since 1884 as pastor of the Fauresmith Reformed Church (GKSA), he was called as the first pastor of the Dorsland Trekkers, mostly Doppers, upon their arrival at S√¢o Janu√°rio, Humpata, Angola. Ordained on October 21, 1888 as such in Burgersdorp, he arrived in Angola in 1889. Besides serving as a pastor there, he founded a school where he taught underprivileged youth. He also began ministering like other Transvaal pioneers to the ‚Äútame folk,‚Äù native servants of the Boers. Ill health forced him to return, handing over the congregation to his brother Marthinus Postma in Mo√ß√¢medes. At the beginning of 1891, he accepted a post as joint pastor of Fauresmith and Petrusburg, then succeeded Rev. Cachet in October 1894 as pastor of the Steynsburg Reformed Church (GKSA) in the Northeastern Cape. On May 6, 1897, he returned to his birthplace in Rustenburg. Financial issues tied to his wife‚Äôs spending lost him his pastorate on June 30, 1905. Trying in vain to win back the frock, he made a living as a traveling peddler of books and other goods in the local countryside.

Early years  Cartan was the youngest child born to Anne Florentine Cottaz (1841‚Äì1927) and Joseph Antoine Cartan (1837‚Äì1917), who was the village blacksmith. Anna had an elder sister Jeanne-Marie (1867‚Äì1931) who became a dressmaker, a brother L√©on (1872‚Äì1956) who became a blacksmith working in his father's smithy, and a middle brother √âlie Cartan (1869‚Äì1951) who became an acclaimed mathematician and sire of a family of mathematicians, notably his first son, Henri Cartan, who later became influential in the field. Anna's brother, √âlie Cartan, later recalled that the family was very poor and his childhood had passed under \\"blows of the anvil, which started every morning from dawn,\\" and that \\"his mother, during those rare minutes when she was free from taking care of the children and the house, was working with a spinning wheel.\\"  Mathematics career  As the family was poor, it would have been very unusual for any of the children to attend college, but in 1901, partly under √âlie's influence, Anna Cartan entered √âcole normale sup√©rieure de jeunes filles in S√®vres near Paris, France. Anna chose to pursue mathematics to become a secondary school teacher. Among the courses she attended were those led by Marie Curie (who taught physics there from 1900 to 1906) and mathematician Jules Tannery (1848‚Äì1910). One of her friends was the scientist and women's rights activist Eug√©nie (Feytis) Cotton who would become director of the school in 1936. Another friend was Marthe Baillaud, the niece of Jules Tannery. Anna completed her studies in mathematics in 1904 and taught the subject at the high school in Poitiers, France from 1904 to 1906, and then she taught in Dijon from 1906 to 1908. In 1908, Cartan received a one-year scholarship established by a French philanthropist Albert Kahn to travel around the world to allow her to \\"enrich her skills and future education by direct knowledge of the world.\\" Among the places she visited were the United States (New York, St. Louis, Chicago, Boston and Niagara Falls), Quebec, Mexico and Cuba. After the tour, she returned to Dijon and taught there until 1916. Then she taught at the Jules Ferry high school in Paris and, until 1920, at the S√®vres application school, annexed to the normal school. In 1912 and 1913, Cartan wrote two books on arithmetic and geometry for girls, and later she co-authored with her brother √âlie two more textbooks for both boys and girls.

The term is not always seen as belonging to technical legal terminology; legislation seldom if ever names a set of laws with the term \\"strict rules of evidence\\"; and the term's precise application varies from one legal context to another. For the purposes of most criminal prosecutions, common law systems have rules about what kinds of evidence can be considered and about how it must be presented, such as the USA Federal Rules of Evidence or the Indian Evidence Act. These rules often disallow, for example, hearsay evidence or bad character evidence. It is generally these rules ‚Äî or at times the most restrictive form of them ‚Äî that are being referred to when \\"the strict rules of evidence\\" are mentioned.David W. Elliott, 'No Evidence: A Ground of Judicial Review in Canadian Administrative Law', Saskatchewan Law Review, 37.1 (1972), 48-100 (p. 67). According to the Council of Europe French-English Legal Dictionary, \\"(proof according to the) strict rules of evidence\\" corresponds to the French concept \\"preuve l√©gale et formelle\\", as opposed to a situation where \\"la preuve de la cause est libre\\" ('the consideration (legal basis) may be proved by any kind of evidence').F. H. S. Bridge, The Council of Europe French-English Legal Dictionary (Strasbourg: Council of Europe, 1994), p. 245 . A legal system may include different evidentiary standards for different kinds of proceedings, for example for civil and criminal proceedings, and these may all be referred to as \\"the strict rules of evidence\\" concerning their particular domain.Olivier Leroux, 'Legal admissibility of electronic evidence', International Review of Law, Computers & Technology, 18.2 (2004), 193-220 (p. 199) . The term strict rules of evidence is most commonly used to specify that they are not to be followed. The most common context for this is when a case goes to arbitration instead of to a court of law.Michael Z. Green, 'No Strict Evidence Rules in Labor and Employment Arbitration', Texas Wesleyan Law Review, 15 (2009), 533-43. Examples in UK law of proceedings not governed by the strict rules of evidence are \\"civil claims which have been allocated to the small claims track\\", and \\"hearings before employment tribunals\\".Adrian Keane and Paul McKeown, The Modern Law of Evidence, 12th edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 2 fn 1. At times, the strict rules of evidence are used to define certain kinds of court cases. For example, section 11 of the UK Civil Evidence Act 1995 specifies that \\"in this Act 'civil proceedings' means civil proceedings, before any tribunal, in relation to which the strict rules of evidence apply, whether as a matter of law or by agreement of the parties\\", while section 134 of the UK Criminal Justice Act 2003 defines \\"criminal proceedings\\" as \\"criminal proceedings in relation to which the strict rules of evidence apply\\".'Criminal Justice Act 2003'.Adrian Keane and Paul McKeown, The Modern Law of Evidence, 12th edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), pp. 2, 305 fn 16, 704.

Reyes grew up in Los Angeles and was an athlete when he was young. But he had a greater passion with art and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting and Drawing with a minor in Sculpture at the Laguna College of Art and Design in 2005. In 2011, Reyes had his debut solo exhibition at Arcadia Gallery in New York. Reyes‚Äôs work has been exhibited all around the world and awarded with numerous prizes by Portrait Society of America, the Art Renewal Center, the California Art Club.  Biography  Reyes was born in Hollywood and was raised in the urban area of Los Angeles. In his youth, Reyes was a talented athlete and soccer player who had brought recruiters calling with offers of scholarships. Reyes had played in championship games around the world and could have taken the path of a professional soccer player. But on a team trip to France, he decided instead to pursue a career in art. In grade school, Reyes discovered that he was partially colorblind. He has difficulty in distinguishing between reds, greens, purples, and blues, as well as between warms and cools. As a result, Reyes had to learn careful color mixing based on his weaknesses. After graduating from college, Reyes married a fellow artist, Candice Bohannon. They have relocated to Texas, where they start offering workshops for the first time.  Painting Style  The human capacity to love, dream, and preserve is the source of inspiration in Reyes's art. His works focus on intimate dramas, revealing brief moments of unnoticed grandeur that are often missed in the hustle of modern existence and tender souls grappling with the pressures of life. One appealing and powerful feature is Reyes' subtle use of color in predominantly monochromatic artworks. He stays away from drastic color mixes, which is partially due to his color blindness.

Its four pockets are shown in yellow; the whole region shaded in either color is the convex hull. In discrete geometry and computational geometry, the convex hull of a simple polygon is the polygon of minimum perimeter that contains a given simple polygon. It is a special case of the more general concept of a convex hull. It can be computed in linear time, faster than algorithms for convex hulls of point sets. The convex hull of a simple polygon can be subdivided into the given polygon itself and into polygonal pockets bounded by a polygonal chain of the polygon together with a single convex hull edge. Repeatedly reflecting an arbitrarily chosen pocket across this convex hull edge produces a sequence of larger simple polygons; according to the Erd≈ës‚ÄìNagy theorem, this process eventually terminates with a convex polygon. Structure The convex hull of a simple polygon is itself a convex polygon. Overlaying the original simple polygon onto its convex hull partitions this convex polygon into regions, one of which is the original polygon. The remaining regions are called pockets. Each pocket is itself a simple polygon, bounded by a polygonal chain on the boundary of the given simple polygon and by a single edge of the convex hull. A polygon that is already convex has no pockets. One can form a hierarchical description of any given polygon by constructing its hull and its pockets in this way and then recursively forming a hierarchy of the same type for each pocket. This structure, called a convex differences tree, can be constructed efficiently. Algorithms Finding the convex hull of a simple polygon can be performed in linear time. Several early publications on this problem were discovered to be incorrect, often because they led to intermediate states with crossings that caused them to break. The first correct linear-time algorithm for this problem was given by . Even after its publication, other incorrect algorithms continued to be published. write that a majority of the published algorithms for the problem are incorrect, although a later history collected by Greg Aloupis lists only seven out of fifteen algorithms as being incorrect. A particularly simple algorithm for this problem was published by and . Like the Graham scan algorithm for convex hulls of point sets, it is based on a stack data structure. The algorithm traverses the polygon in clockwise order, starting from a vertex known to be on the convex hull (for instance, its leftmost point). As it does, it stores a convex sequence of vertices on the stack, the ones that have not yet been identified as being within pockets. The points in this sequence are the vertices of a convex polygon (not necessarily the hull of all vertices seen so far) that may have pockets attached to some of its edges. At each step, the algorithm follows a path along the polygon from the stack top to the next vertex that is not in one of the two pockets adjacent to the stack top. Then, while the top two vertices on the stack together with this new vertex are not in convex position, it pops the stack, before finally pushing the new vertex onto the stack. When the clockwise traversal reaches the starting point, the algorithm is completed and the stack contains the convex hull vertices in clockwise order. Each step of the algorithm either pushes a vertex onto the stack or pops it from the stack, and each vertex is pushed and popped at most once, so the total time for the algorithm is linear. If the input vertices are given in clockwise order in an array, then the output can be returned in the same array, using only a constant number of additional variables as intermediate storage. A similar method can also be used to construct convex hulls of piecewise smooth closed curves in the plane. By using a deque in place of a stack, a similar algorithm can be generalized to the convex hull of any polygonal chain, and the algorithm for simple polygons can be started at any vertex of the polygon rather than requiring an extreme vertex as the starting vertex. Flipping pockets A flip of a pocket constructs a new polygon from the given one by reflecting the polygonal chain that bounds a pocket across the convex hull edge of the pocket. Each flip produces another simple polygon with equal perimeter and greater area, although multiple simultaneous flips may introduce crossings. Flipping an arbitrarily chosen pocket, and then repeating this process with the pockets of each successively formed polygon, produces a sequence of simple polygons. According to the Erd≈ës‚ÄìNagy theorem, this flipping process eventually terminates, by reaching a convex polygon. As with the problem of convex hull construction, this problem has a long history of incorrect proofs.

The Command keeps the War Flag of the Artillery Arm, which has been decorated with a Military Order of Italy, three Gold Medals of Military Valor, a Silver Medal of Military Valor, and a Bronze Medal of Military Valor.  History  In its current form, the Artillery Command was set up on 1 October 2010 in the Bracciano headquarters, following the suppression of the Artillery Brigade Command, based in Portogruaro, and of the Artillery School, based in Bracciano. = Artillery Brigade = Roots of the Artillery Brigade date back to 1959 in a series of commands that, over time, have carried out managerial functions for the artillery assigned to the 5th Army Corps.  Missile Brigade  The first unit to carry out this role was the III Missile Brigade, established on 1 October 1959. In 1977, renamed the 3rd Missile Brigade \\"Aquileia\\", the Brigade also assumed the functions of Artillery Command for the 5th Army Corps. On 1 March 1959 the 3rd Heavy Artillery Regiment activated two missile groups armed with Honest John Missile systems. On 1 October 1959 the regiment's names was changed to 3rd Heavy Missile Artillery Regiment and it became the first unit of the newly raised 3rd Missile Brigade in Vicenza. The regiment added a third missile group on 15 November 1960 and a fourth missile group on 15 November 1962. Each group fielded four Honest John launch systems and were based in Elvas, Oderzo, Codogn√© and Portogruaro. In summer 1973 the 3rd Missile Artillery Regiment began the transition to the MGM-52 Lance missile system. On 27 July 1975 the 3rd Missile Group \\"Volturno\\" fired the first Lance missiles on Italian soil from the Salto di Quirra military firing range at Perdasdefogu in Sardinia. After the successful launch the group was declared operational. The same year the Italian army abolished the regimental level, moved from Roman numerals to Arabic numerals and awarded new honorific titles to units. Therefore, the brigade became the 3rd Missile Brigade \\"Aquileia\\". With the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces. One of the seven brigades that were disbanded in 1991 was the 3rd Missile Brigade \\"Aquileia\\". On 30 November 1991 the brigade was disbanded, but on 1 December 1991 the 3rd Artillery Regiment \\"Aquileia\\" was activated in Portogruaro with brigade's staff and the remaining units of the brigade. The remaining units passed to 5th Army Corps.  From the 5th Army Corps to the COM.F.O.TER.  On 1 October 1982 the artillery management functions within the 5th Army Corps passed to the 5th Corps Artillery Command based in Vittorio Veneto. The Artillery Command moved to Treviso on 1 November 1986. Following the disestablishment of the Divisions of the Italian Army, the Command obtained the Artillery Groups formerly belonging of the disestablished Divisions: * 5th Field Artillery Group \\"Superga\\" from the Infantry Division \\"Mantova\\"; * 14th Field Artillery Group \\"Murge\\"; * 155th Heavy Field Artillery Group \\"Emilia\\"; * 132nd Heavy Field Artillery Group \\"Rovereto\\"; * 33rd Heavy Field Artillery Group \\"Terni\\"; * 5th Specialist Artillery Group \\"Medea\\"; * 6th Specialist Artillery Group \\"Montello\\"; * 7th Specialist Artillery Group \\"Casarsa\\"; * 9th Heavy Artillery Group \\"Rovigo\\" from the 3rd Missile Brigade \\"Aquileia\\"; * 41st Specialist Artillery Group \\"Cordenons\\" from the 3rd Missile Brigade \\"Aquileia\\". In 1991 the 14th Field Artillery Group \\"Murge\\" and 5th, 6th and 7th Specialist Artillery Groups were disestablished and 5th, 33rd, 41st, 132nd and 155th Groups were merged into the 5th Field Artillery Regiment \\"Superga\\". In 1992 the 155th Heavy Field Artillery Group \\"Emilia\\" was disestablished with the 5th Group being upgraded to Regiment. As of late 1992, the Artillery Command had the 5th Regiment (with 33rd, 41st and 132nd Groups), the 5th Field Artillery Regiment \\"Superga\\", the 3rd Regiment \\"Volturno\\", il 27th Regiment \\"Marche\\" and the 13th Target Acquisition Group. The 5th Regiment was disestablished on 31 March 1993. The 33rd Group became the 33rd Artillery Regiment \\"Acqui\\", the 41st Group passed directly under the Artillery Command and the 132nd Artillery Group \\"Rovereto\\" was disestablished. On 30 September 1993 the 13th Target Acquisition Group was disestablished. In 1995, the 27th Heavy Self-propelled Artillery Regiment \\"Marche\\" was disestablished and the Artillery Command moved to Portogruaro. In 1996 the 41st Group was transferred to the C.I.D.E. in Anzio. The attributions of the 5th Corps Artillery Command passed, on 30 November 1997, to the Artillery Group Command. On 1 December 1997, the Artillery Group Command became the Artillery Group Command of the Land Operational Forces, taking five artillery regiments under it, including the Field Artillery Regiment \\"a Cavallo\\".  Artillery Brigade: 2002-2010  Following the restructuring measures put in place since the early 2000s, the Artillery Group Command was reorganized into the Artillery Brigade in January 2002, together with the other Combat Support Commands, with four Regiments: three artillery regiments and one NBCR defence regiment. The Artillery Brigade inherited traditions of both Artillery Group Command and 3rd Missile Brigade \\"Aquileia\\". The Artillery Brigade was established consisting of two echeleons, one aimed at preparing the dependent units, while the other was intended for the establishment of the Commands in operations or for reinforcement with specialists from other Commands engaged in operations. The reorganization led to the designation of \\"Brigade\\" (rather than \\"Grouping\\") being adopted, including the Brigade Staff in order to perform all the functions of the Brigade Staff at the Brigade level. On 30 September 2010 the Artillery Brigade was disestablished and merged into the present-day Artillery Command. = Artillery School = Coat of Arms of the Training Regiment of the Artillery School. Training establishments related to artillery date back to the XVIII Century, when King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia established the Royal School of Artillery and Fortification. In 1821, it was merged with the existing Royal Military Academy and assumed the name of Application School of Artillery and Engineering.  The origins: 1888-1915  The traditions of the School of Artillery draw their origins from the \\"Central School of Artillery Shooting\\" (Scuola Centrale di Tiro di Artiglieria), established on 1 July 1888 (Royal Decree No. 131 of 24 June 1888) in Nettuno. The School was established in order to give adequate impetus to the professional education of cadres and to give artillery training a unitary direction, supported by application standards corresponding to the performance of weapons. In 1894, at the Bracciano shooting range, the first training course on firing with fortress and siege artillery was held for Fortress Artillery Officers. Following the 1910 Spingardi Reform, on 9 August 1910, the Shool split, giving rise to two distinct Schools, the Central School of Field Artillery (including mountain artillery and horse artillery) which remained in Nettuno, and the Central Fortress Artillery School, which was established in Rome with a shooting range in Bracciano. During the First World War the two schools lost their didactic function. In Bracciano a Training Group was established for the preparation of personnel for the specialist units. In Nettuno a special \\"Experimental Section\\" was established at the Central School of Artillery with experimental and testing tasks in order to rapidly upgrade and modernize the artilleries. On the other hand, personnel training took place in the depots located behind the front. Among them, should be remembered that of Spilimbergo, which assumed the name of Shooting School.  Between wars: Civitavecchia  In 1920, the two schools merged into the Central Artillery School in Bracciano, in the reorganization process which concentrated the combat schools in the area. In 1925 the Artillery Central School was transferred in Civitavecchia, directly under the Army General Staff. In 1921, the Experimental Section in Nettuno, which had been considerably strengthened during the conflict, became autonomous, first establishing itself in the Directorate of Artillery Experiences and, subsequently, in 1927, in the Artillery Experience Centre. The courses were held mainly for Officers who were preparing to take up the posts of group or regimental commander. The courses were organized according to a tripartite scheme: * a first period, common, necessary to give a panoramic and general vision of the use of the units of the various branches according to the dictates of the current doctrine; * a second period, at the respective branch school, in which Officers deepened the study of the characteristics and technique of the weapon they belong to; * a third period, again in common, which ensured, through practical exercises and maneuvers with cadres, the acquisition of operational concepts concerning joint cooperation. The School did not have its own Units. For the exercises it had the regiments of the Division \\"Torino\\", also based in Civitavecchia, and permanently received in aggregation from other bodies the Groups or Batteries of the non-divisional artillery specialties. In 1927 the Artillery Shooting School, aimed to troops and enlisted personnel, was reestablished and reactivated in Nettuno. The Artillery Shooting School was directly under the Inspector of Artillery.  Second World War  During the Second World War the activity of the Shooting School of Neptune had a notable increase, above all to retrain the ranks of reservists called to arms who had to constitute or complete the Artillery units. In 1944 the Central School of Artillery was hit by the allied landing which destroyed the Artillery Experience Center. At the end of the war, the Experience Center remained in Nettuno and was strengthened, also incorporating the Infantry Experience Center of Santa Severa as the 5th Experience Section.  After Second World War: 1946-2010  Shoulder patch of the former Artillery School. After the Second World War, the reconstruction was not long in coming. On 27 January 1945, the 152nd Artillery Regiment \\"Piceno\\" moved to Bracciano assuming the following organic constitution: * Command; * School and Artillery Complements Group; * School and Engineer Complements Battalion; * Mixed complements battalion. On 10 April 1945, the 152nd Artillery Regiment \\"Piceno\\" was renamed \\"Artillery Training Regiment\\". On 15 January 1946 the Artillery Training Regiment was renamed Artillery School. Definitively returned to Bracciano, the School was unified into a single institute and placed under the Military Central Schools Command. In 1946 the School of Mechanics of Artillery Workers of Civitavecchia passed under the control of the School of Artillery of Bracciano, of which it became a detachment. Chief of Army Staff Luigi Efisio Marras in 1947 strengthened the Officers Schools: the Schools of Arms Cooperation (Scuola Cooperazione Varie Armi, S.CO.V.A.), grouping the Schools in Civitavecchia, was established in the same year. On 25 October, the Artillery School was granted the task of keeping the War Flag of the Arm of Artillery. In 1948, with the establishment of the 1st Battery of reserve officers cadets, the Artillery School also assumed the nature of a training institute for reserve cadres, while it lost the Anti-aircraft detachments of Bracciano, Sabaudia and Civitavecchia. In 1949 the XI Field Artillery Group was moved to the then-V Territorial Military Command in Padua. In 1951, the Artillery School gave birth to a new specialty with the establishment of a Artillery Light Aviation Unit, which was later renamed Army Light Aviation Unit; in 1958 the Army Light Aviation Unit was transferred to Viterbo, thus giving rise to the Army Aviation. In 1954 the Reserve Officers and Sub- officers School was established in Foligno, with the exception of the self- propelled speciality and the Artillery specialists who kept their headquarters in Bracciano, both under the VIII Territorial Military Command of Rome. In 1956 the artillery training sector was reorganized. The command of all the Artillery Schools was entrusted to a General, who was supported by: * a Colonel, Deputy Commander; * a Colonel, Course Director * a Colonel, commander of the Reserve Officers and Sub-officers School in Foligno. The Deputy Commander oversaw the entire logistical and administrative organization of the School and also performed the functions of Corps Commander in relation to the demonstration Units. The Colonel, Course Director, on the other hand, presided over the didactic organization, making use of the activities of some \\"units\\". In 1956 a \\"Technical Application Course\\" was launched for the training of Artillery Officers. In 1964, the School was again reorganized. The Commanding General, in turn dependent on the Inspector of the Arm of Artillery, had under its dependencies a Chief of Staff as coordinator of the activity, both disciplinary and logistic, of the whole school complex. The actual training part was carried out within four \\"Courses Units\\": * The first Course Unit provided for the organization and development of the courses the Captains to be promoted. * The second Course Unit provided for the development of courses for reserve officers snd Subofficers and for student team leaders of the missile and self-propelled specialties. * The third Course Unit included all the operational units of the School as well as the Light Aircraft Section and some batteries for non-divisional specialties. In addition to the personnel training, it also provided units and means for the training for those attending the Courses, for carrying out demonstration, cooperation and experience exercises; moreover, it organized the Technical-Application Course and refresher courses for the personnel of all ranks recalled from leave. * The fourth Course Unit, located in Civitavecchia, also included a demonstration specialist Battery and took care of the training at all levels of the personnel assigned to the specialist unit. In January 1976 the Army established two Artillery Groups, operational and demonstrative pawns of the School: the 1st Self-Propelled Field Artillery Group \\"Cacciatori delle Alpi\\", formed from the 8th Army Corps Self-propelled Field Artillery Group, and the 18th Field Artillery Group \\"Gran Sasso\\" formed from the 1st Group of the 13th Artillery Regiment. On 2 May 1976 the 1st Group inherited the War Flag, the Red Tie and the Garibaldi traditions of the 1st Artillery Regiment. These two Artillery Groups were joined by the an A.U.C. Group, which took care of the training and training of the Reserve Officer Cadets and the Subfofficers of the self-propelled specialities, the Specialists Group and a Support Unit. In June 1981, with the dissolution of the School of Artillery Officers and Subfofficers in Foligno which took care of the training of the students of mechanical towing specialities, the 18th Group was suppressed and transformed into the Mechanical Towing A.U.C. Group, while the 1st Artillery Group lost the \\"Self-propelled\\" designation and became the demonstrative group of the School. All activities were thus concentrated in Bracciano. On 15 June 1986, the War Flag drape was replaced. Subsequent reorganizations led to the dissolution of the Specialists Group and of the Support Unit. The latter one was later reconstituted once the two A.U.C. Groups were merged into a single training institution. From 1 October 1997 to September 2009, the School Commander carried out the command activity on the Training and Experimentation Centre for the Anti-Aircraft Artillery of Sabaudia. The Commander also assumed the position of Deputy Inspector of the Arm of Artillery on the same date. On 12 November 1999, the 1st Artillery Group \\"Cacciatori delle Alpi\\" was disestablished and its flag returned to the Shrine of the Flags at the Altare della Patria in Rome. The Artillery School was reorganized into a Training Group and a Support Group. On 1 February 2006 a new organization was introduced. The General Staff was reorganised and the Training Regiment was established on 1 March 2006; at the same time, the Logistics Support Group and the Training Group were dissolved. The establishment of the Training Regiment was decided in order to optimize the performance of the institutional tasks of the School of Artillery and to develop the training activity. On 30 September 2010 the School was disestablished and merged into the present-day Artillery Command. = Artillery Command = The Artillery Command was established on 1 October 2010 in Bracciano on the basis of the Artillery School. The Artillery Command was the result of the merger of the Inspectorate of the Arm of Artillery, of the Artillery Brigade and of the Artillery School.
