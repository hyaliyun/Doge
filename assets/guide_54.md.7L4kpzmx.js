Research Kelly‚Äôs early work and main contribution as a historian of political theory was as part of a group of revisionist Bentham scholars, having worked on the manuscripts at the Bentham Project at University College London. Kelly rejected the common claim that Bentham was a crude act-utilitarian. Instead, he argued that Bentham developed a complex two-level utilitarian theory similar to those of contemporary indirect utilitarian theorists such as R. M. Hare or John Gray. His further claim that this makes Bentham a central figure in the canon of liberal political philosophers contradicts most standard interpretations, and is still a widely contested interpretation.See David Lyons ‚ÄòBentham, Utilitarianism and Distribution‚Äô, Utilitas, vol. 4, no. 2, (1992), pp. 323-8 See discussion in Brian Barry, Justice as Impartiality , Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1995, pp. 136-7 James E. Crimmins, ‚ÄòContending Interpretations of Bentham‚Äôs Utilitarianism‚Äô, Canadian Journal of Political Science, Vol. 29, no. 4, (1996), pp. 751-777 Having based his early work on both archival work and philosophical reconstruction, Kelly has gone on to engage in debates about the methodology and importance of history in the study of political thought. His work on the book Political Thinkers, edited with David Boucher, has defended a non-contextualist approach to past political thinkers in contrast to the linguistic contextualism defended by Quentin Skinner amongst others. His scepticism about reducing political theory to history has also led to a similar scepticism about the claims made for identity in normative political theory. His criticism of multicultural theories and communitarianism, has led to a defence of liberal egalitarianism that draws on the work of British political theorists such as Brian Barry (1936‚Äì2009) and H. L. A. Hart (1907‚Äì1992), as much as that of John Rawls. Kelly‚Äôs work on liberal egalitarianism has concentrated on its claims as a political theory and his most recent work is on the defence of liberal moralism against the arguments of ‚Äòrealist‚Äô political theorists such as Bernard Williams.

The school grew to become Berry College. The original church building still stands on the Berry campus. Early years The Possum Trot Church is known as the \\"cradle of Berry College.\\" It was first built around the 1850s. The old church was appropriated by Martha Berry for the Possum Trot Sunday School in 1900. Possum Trot was a school from 1900 to 1954. The needs of the people at Possum Trot, and places like it, inspired her to build schools to help the local children learn how to use their talents and resources better. Miss Berry's title, \\"The Sunday Lady of Possum Trot,\\" originated from her teaching Sunday school at the church. In the early 1930s, three schoolrooms that matched the rustic setting were added and the grammar grades were moved there from the log cabin area on the main campus. Children of faculty and staff and the Possum Trot children attended classes together. These children studied under the able teaching of Mrs. Fred (Elsie Andrews) Ford, who had previously taught at both the Mountain School and at the grammar school in the log cabin area. Miss Berry didn't have bibles for the children. Instead, she painted murals on the walls. To this day, the walls still proclaim, \\"The eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good.\\"http://www.berry.edu/oakhill/possumtrot.asp  The later years  During World War II and for a short period following, from 1942‚Äì1948, the Possum Trot school was closed. It reopened in 1948 with Elizabeth Daniels Taylor as teacher and James Daniels as industrial arts teacher. Later Mrs. Samuel Poe Carden taught at Possum Trot until the school was closed in 1954. One of the classrooms was renovated by the Berry College Student Government Association as a Mountain Day American Bicentennial project in 1976. Student interest in Possum Trot has remained high over the years, and in 1984-85 and 1985‚Äì86, the Student Government Association assisted through volunteer work in the full restoration of the buildings. With the assistance of the physical plant of Berry College and with alumni volunteers led by Newton Wagner, a Possum Trot graduate, the safety and preservation of this historic complex have been assured.  Homecoming  Possum Trot Homecoming is held each year on the third Sunday in September with \\"dinner on the grounds\\" between \\"preaching\\" at 11 a.m. and \\"singing\\" in the afternoon. The public is always welcome to bring their own dinner and participate in this event. There is a small log house located behind the church. It once served as the home economics department and as the kitchen and dining hall for the Possum Trot School. This cottage had started to fall apart due to lack of use until it caught the eye of an enterprising industrial education student, Robert Plank, from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, who offered to restore it in exchange for its use as a residence for himself and his wife until he graduated. His offer was accepted, and upon his graduation in 1976, it became staff housing.

Often seen in rainforest margins or eucalyptus forest in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, it is a terrestrial fern with reddish new growth. Taxonomy Doodia aspera was one of the many species first described by the botanist Robert Brown in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, and it still bears its original name. The genus is named for Samuel Doody, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden, and the species name aspera is the feminine form of the Latin adjective asper \\"rough\\", referring to the rachis and stipe. Description Prickly rasp fern grows as fronds which rise vertically from the black scaled rhizome. These fronds are usually long. The frond segments have dentate (toothed) margins, and measure around long, and in a zig-zag pattern up the stem. Both the fronds and stipe are covered in small bumps, giving them a rough texture. When young, the fronds are a pinkish colour which changes to green with maturity. Distribution and habitat Doodia aspera is found all along eastern New South Wales, and into Victoria and Queensland. It is particularly common in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. It grows on sandstone and igneous (granite and basalt) substrates, in sand- or gravelly soils It is also found on Norfolk Island. In tall open forest in the Sydney region, it is an understory ground cover in damp areas underneath such trees as Sydney blue gum (Eucalyptus saligna), mountain gum (E. deanei), river peppermint (E. elata) and forest red gum (E. tereticornis). It is also found in rainforest and dry open forest. Doodia aspera can grow as scattered plants or as dense colonies. Ecology Tolerant of short dry periods, Doodia aspera can be found in full sun as well as shade. The spores are dispersed by wind. Cultivation Readily adaptable to cultivation, Doodia aspera grows in shade or sun with adequate moisture on acidic soils with some organic content. Drainage needs to be sufficient to prevent waterlogging. The pinkish to reddish new growth is an attractive feature. The fern is readily propagated by collecting and germinating the spores, or dividing the rhizomes.

The revolutionary movement was largely made up by the dissident rural peasantry led by a group of discontented leftist intellectuals against Prince Norodom Sihanouk‚Äôs political organization ‚Äìthe Sangkum regime. The rebellion first erupted in early 1967 in the Samlaut subdistrict when hundreds of frustrated peasants who were fed up with the government policies, treatment by local military, land displacement, and other poor socio-economic conditions, revolted against the government, first killing two soldiers on the morning of April 2.Hinton, 2004, p.53 In the following weeks, the revolt quickly expanded with much more destruction of government property and personnel. By June 1967, 4,000 or more villagers fled their homes in Southern Battambang Province into the marquis (forest) to join the growing group of rebels and escape the military troops sent by Sihanouk.Kiernan, 1982, p.166 In the early 1968, Cambodia experienced a more organized and mature second uprising that expanded both geographically and politically through months of re-grouping, recruitment and propaganda processes, and was much more widespread and destructive than the first occurrence.Kiernan, 1982, p.166 According to some academics such as Ben Kiernan and Donald Kirk, the Samlaut rebellion is seen as the initial beginnings of the Cambodian revolutionary movement (the Cambodian Civil War) that eventually led to victory of the Khmer Rouge and the establishment of the Democratic Kampuchea. Kiernan says that the rebellion was the ‚Äúbaptism of fire for the small but steadily growing Cambodian revolutionary movement‚ÄùKiernan, 1982, p.166 while Kirk mentions that it was ‚Äúa prelude, in a microcosm, of the conflict that would sweep across the country three years later.‚ÄùKirk, p.78 Causes, Background & Origins of the Rebellion It is important to note that there have been differing constructed narratives of this rebellion due to the problematic political alignments involved in the Cambodian struggle. Firstly, the Republican government wanted to portray the Cambodian revolutionary movement as largely a foreign (mainly Vietnamese) transplant and preferred to gloss over the significance of indigenous leftist activity from 1967.Kiernan, 1975, p.ii Alternatively, F.U.N.K.(National United Front of Kampuchea) wanted to demonstrate unity between Sihanouk supporters and the Khmer Rouge, understating the extent of the development of the revolutionary opposition to Sihanouk before his overthrow.Kiernan, 1975, p.ii In recent scholarship by prominent historians such as David Chandler and Milton Osborne, their general understanding of the rebellion was that it was primarily a localized action. According to Chandler, the revolt ‚Äúsprang from local grievances against injustice and social change, corruption, and ham-fisted government behavior‚Äù and that the participants ‚Äúdid not respond to orders from the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) central committee‚Äù.Chandler, 1991, p.166 Milton Osborne writes that the rebellion ‚Äúwas more an outbreak of largely spontaneous resistance to government actions than the first orchestrated challenge from the radicals‚Äù.Osborne, 1994 Apart from Sihanouk's strong-handed and corrupt Sangkum regime that fueled peasant grievances, there have been diverging strands contributing the origins of this rebellion. For instance, the rebellion was identified to have communist roots as it was the first part of Pol Pot's social and political two-phased strategy executed by the CPK.Chindawongse, 1991, p.138 Furthermore, even Sihanouk himself was ignorant of this highly internalized and localized conflict, believing it result from foreign instigation.Kiernan, 1982 A Localized Rebellion: Political Environment & Socio-Economic Conditions With the escalation of the war in South Vietnam in 1965, the colonization of Battambang entered a new phase as thousands of Khmer Krom families began to cross the Vietnam-Cambodia border. The main government settlements were established in Kampot, Kirirom, Kompong Chhnang (Chriev) and Ratanakiri, with Battambang having the largest settlement.Kiernan, 1982, p.175-176 Sihanouk's generosity towards them increasingly became a source of grievance for the local inhabitants as they found themselves displaced from their land (many of whom did not even own their land) with unfavorable economic conditions.Tyner, 2008, p.66 Following the September 1966 election, the National Assembly was dominated by rightists with a minority of leftists, namely, Khieu Samphan, Hou Youn and Hu Nim, all of whom played highly influential roles in leading the revolts to come. As the newly elected Government asserted its control over Cambodia's provinces, it penetrated into the village level and was supported by the Prime Minister Lon Nol and the Royal Cambodian Army, boring down heavily on many peasants and pushing the Left towards the defensive.Kiernan, 1982, p.168 Furthermore, Sihanouk's wavering stance between the Right and Left appeared to be leaning towards the Rightists as he had imprisoned several Pracheachon party members and announced his non-endorsement for the September elections.Kiernan, 1982, p.168 Sihanouk's supposedly neutralist policy had its roots in the independence struggle against French colonialism where Sihanouk forged alliances with several anti-French guerilla groups, both Leftists and Rightists. After independence, this neutrality, though maintained, started to diverge as Sihanouk allied himself principally with politicians on the right of the political spectrum. He did attempt to ally himself with certain members of the political left, such as Khieu Samphan. However, according to Etcheson, his relations with his domestic left were perfunctory and at most tactical. ‚ÄúThe Prince encouraged his security forces to persecute the mass organizations of the Left, especially the main Leftist one, the Pracheachon, and its covert sister organizations in the countryside and the cities.‚ÄùEtcheson, 2007, p.191 Progressively, there appeared to be increasingly visible cracks within the political sphere as respective sides, strengthened and consolidated. As the Left gradually co-ordinated its activities, holding demonstrations in the towns, attacking the government and conducting propaganda efforts in the countryside, the predominantly right-winged government upped its military and economic regulations.Kiernan, 1982, p.168 While Sihanouk was away in France, Lon Nol had considerable autonomy in effecting his economic policies. Often identified as the main driver of the rebellion, the rammassage du paddy was an efficient system imposed by Lon Nol in early 1967 whereby the government channels (mainly the military) took charge of buying and collecting the rice crops from the peasants.Heder, 1979 1982, p.8Weltig, 2008, p.53 This was in response to the rise of a large rice export black market that greatly affected Cambodia's economy as it was heavily dependent on its taxation of rice exports. Here, farmers illegally sold much of Cambodia's rice to the Viet Cong (VC) across the borders as they paid more as compared the Cambodian government. Lon Nol was seriously concerned about the sale of large proportions of the rice crop to the VC or on the Saigon black market where clandestine sales were apparently handled by local Chinese middlemen who had found friends and worked in conjunction with cells of former Viet Minh sympathizers acting on behalf of the VC.Kiernan, 1982, p.168-169Chindawongse, 2008, p.139 This system provoked an uproar by the rural population in Battambang Province where it was first introduced as many households not only saw their earnings being severely reduced due to the low prices offered for the crops, but were also forcibly made to surrender their produce at gunpoint.Osborne, 1979Chandler, 1991, p.164-165 Furthermore, the strong intervention and presence of the army in Battambang involved the forming of co-operatives, forcing villagers to regroup while bearing the obligation of being a co-operative member in paying subscriptions to finance loans that fell into the hands of corrupt officials.Kiernan, 1982, p.176 In turn, they were given insecticides that were often mediocre quality or even false substitutes. Also, army officials were able to engage in illegal smuggling across the borders. Generally, activities of the army in Battambang prior to the revolt were heavy-handed and often brutal, alienating and enraging the inhabitants.Kiernan, 1982, p.177 Another cause of growing peasant resentment and unrest would be attributed to the severe exploitation or confiscation of villagers by landowners.Martin, 2004, p.112 For instance, in Pailin Province, arable land was bought from the villages and converted into plantations for the expanding fruit industry, dominated by the Chinese and Burmese. The Khmer peasants either had to work for them as coolies or were displaced from their homeland.Blanadet, 1970, p.374 In other areas like Andoeuk Hep district, peasants faced harsh conditions due to the unsustainability and unproductivity of the cotton industry ‚Äì due to high cost of labour and materials in intensive cotton cultivation, peasants cultivated large areas of land with low yields per hectare.Kiernan, 1982, p.178 The situation was further exacerbated by the increasing susceptibility to encroaching weeds and insects, greatly decreasing the yields. This caused large areas of land to lose their value, many peasants had to find other jobs while facing high indebtedness and landlessness. Also, peasant discontent was contributed by the growing domination by the Chinese and other landowners, including Government officials. The continual buying and selling of land, due to failed crops, produced increasing impoverishment and a class conflict. Centered on rapidly growing fruit plantations, it was a conflict between a ‚Äòrich and enterprising Chinese bourgeoisie which has taken possession of the land, and the alienated, indebted, and already semi- independent village communities.‚ÄùBlanadet, 1971, p.192 According to Kiernan, it was clear that ‚Äúcorruption, the misuse of military and other authority, and increasing impoverishment, in the Samlaut, Pailin and Andoeuk Hep districts, for example, created a vast reservoir of peasant unrest that lacked only a reasonably sophisticated leadership. By early 1967, that leadership had begun to take shape and it provided, as well as a sympathetic and purposeful ideology, the guidance to enable an already disaffected peasantry to carry out a serious and effective rebellion.‚ÄùKiernan, 1982, p.180 Khmer Rouge Rebels In the larger scheme of things, it is believed that external forces, namely Vietnamese and Chinese (to a smaller extent) communists played a role in planting the seeds of rural revolt. For instance, after 1945, the Vietnamese Communists were active in their Cambodian oriented efforts, sending cadres into the country to encourage, encadred and attempt to establish Communist hegemony over the movement for independence.Heder, 1979, p.2 In September 1960, the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) was founded. The rebellion was not simply a result of plotting by the radical left, though small pro-communist groups had been established in Battambang for years. CPK agitators like Khieu Samphan did play a part in fanning peasant discontent, but they were aided by widespread resentment at falling crop prices, bankruptcy, and the high-handed behavior of the military. Some historians, such as Ben Kiernan, have stated that evidence points to the fact that the clandestine CPK was in fact planning an uprising across the country, citing the fact that the demonstrations rapidly spread to other, widely separated provinces. It is argued that some of the disturbances in 1967 were part of a coordinated effort by the leftists to destabilise Sihanouk's regime, though the official Khmer Rouge historiography given by Pol Pot later sought to deny this, stating its open rebellion only occurred in January 1968 and that the Samlaut incident was \\"premature\\"Kiernan, 2004, p.267-267 and surprised the communist partyJackson, 2014, p.19 ‚ÄúThe people armed themselves with knives, axes, clubs and other weapons they could lay their hands on to attack police stations and military garrisons,‚Äù Pol Pot later explained. ‚Äú[But] the Party Central Committee had not yet decided on general armed insurrection throughout the country.\\"Weltig, 2008, p.53-54 The Rebellion Ultimately, it was an amalgamation of elements that contributed to the 1967-68 peasant-led uprisings against the post-independence political developments. 1967 First Uprising Armed resistance by the Left broke out in April, erupting in the Samlaut area in northwestern Battambang Province, a province long noted for the presence of large landowners and great disparities of wealth.Chandler, 1991, p.164 On 2 April 1967, angry peasants attacked the soldiers who were collecting rice from the villagers, killing two of them and stole several rifles.Kiernan, 1982, p.171 In the afternoon, 200 rebels marched carrying banners denouncing the Lon Nol Government and U.S. imperialism, and attacked the J.S.R.K. (Royal Khmer Socialist Youth) agricultural settlement at Stung Kranhoung, the most obvious symbol of government presence in the area ‚Äìthe source of the villagers‚Äô grievances and official mistreatment, as the target for their first organized display of force.Kiernan, 1982, p.179 By the evening of that day, they defeated guards from two other posts and executed a mayor. Over the next few weeks, the rural movement caused destruction to public infrastructure, agricultural settlements, seized weaponry and killed several army and village officials.Kiernan, 1982, p.179 During this initial outbreak, Sihanouk was on one of his frequent sojourns in France, and Lon Nol, the prime minister, responded harshly. A platoon of paratroopers and the national police were sent into the region to protect the population, allegedly having been offered a bounty for each severed head of a rebel or leftist that they sent back to Phnom Penh.Rummel, 1997, 163 There, they discovered a rebel hide-out, their ration depots, stolen weaponry and captured 73 rebels.Kiernan, 1982, p.171B.B.C. Summary of World Broadcasts, FE/2434/A3/8. In the subsequent three weeks, nearly 200 rebels had been captured and 19 killed, however, rebel operations continued to spread geographically.Kiernan, 1982, p.171 On 22 April, Sihanouk charged five leftist deputies, including Khieu Samphan, Hou Yuon and Hu Nim with the responsibility for the rebellion, however, Khieu and Hou managed to disappear into the maquis. Hu Nim persisted in his attempts to maintain a public profile and to work alongside the government, but after repeated warnings from Sihanouk, he had also departed by the end of the year. On 5 May, workers from the Kompong Cham textile facotory, as well as its Director, and students from Kompong Cham University staged a demonstration with banners and loudspeakers, blaming the Government for the disappearance and suspected execution of Khieu and Hou.Realites Cambodgiennes, 19 May 1967, p.3 Despite attempts at amnesty offered by Sihanouk to the local rebels, the rebellion continued to spread to the other districts towards the north and the east, with many of the villagers fleeing to the maquis to avoid the advancing army battalion.Kiernan, 1982, p.173 On the eastern side of the country, seventy armed followers of CPK cadre So Phim infiltrated the town of Kandol Chrum, killed a former district chief, and wounded a government agent; Ieng Thirith, another prominent Communist, was seen in Samlaut itself.Kiernan, p.250 In several areas across the country, suspected Communists were arrested, driven underground, or in some cases shot.Kiernan, pp.254-255 With growing peasant unrest, Sihanouk was ready to sanction the brutal repression of leftist rebels, using the greatest possible force. Lon Nol had been implacable and retribution had ranged from summary execution to the burning of villages. Ghoulish details were provided of trucks filled with severed heads that were sent from Battambang to Phnom Penh so that Lon Nol would be assured that his programme was being followed. At the end of April, Lon Nol resigned, though reasons behind his resignation were not clear (he was said to have suffered from some form of injury during the period of unrest). In May and June, the military became even more brutal with Royal Cambodian Air Force aircraft bombing and strafing villages and jungle hide-outs, villages being burned to the ground or surrounded by the army and peasants massacred.Kiernan, 1982, p.173Chandler, 1991, p.165 In June, Sihanouk declared that the Samlaut Rebellion was at an end, by which more than 4000 residents had fled into the forests for over a month. From October 1967 onwards, younger left-wing groups from the towns, including school teachers and ex-students, stepped up their liaisons with previously dormant cells of Communist sympathizers in remote areas like southern Battambang, while others joined the maquis.Kiernan, 1982, p.168 By the end of 1967, unrest was reported in eleven of the country's eighteen provinces. The Khmer Loeu regions of Mondulkiri Province and Ratanakiri Province fell almost entirely under CPK control by the end of the decade. In December, word had been passed around that the Samlaut rebellion was about to enter another phase.Kiernan, 1982, p.181 1968 Second Uprising Peasant support for the revolutionaries was compounded by persistent and increasingly oppressive processes such as the resumption of rammassage campaigns in late December 1967 and the government's decision to appoint village headmen and officials directly.Kiernan, 1982, p.185 Before 1968, headmen were elected by villagers, although the provincial authorities usually selected the candidates.Kiernan, 1982, p.185 As such, the central Government intervention represented a significant development in rural administrative repression by Phnom Penh, resented by many peasants who cherished the traditional autonomy of village affairs. Here, local corruption and increased administrative domination now threatened to add to other long- standing peasant grievances. Furthermore, in January, the American escalation of the Vietnam War was at its peak, instilling much paranoia and discontent amongst Kampuchea's outlawed dissident Left about Cambodia's potential sell- out to the Americans under Sihanouk based on visits from U.S. ambassador to India Chester Bowles and Marshal Tito.Sihanouk appeared to be engaging in talks with the U.S. Ambassador to resume diplomatic relations and Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia to discuss a ‚Äúsell-out‚Äù to the Americans. However, according to the Prince, these visits were necessary to prevent the threat of invasion and war by the U.S.. (Kiernan, 1982, p. 182) The CPK's mid-1967 decision to organize a peasant army to wage all-out armed struggle against the Sihanouk regime could not be implemented immediately. By January 1968, the Battambang rebels were in touch with others in Kompong Chhnang and Kompot. More and more townspeople and intellectuals who were younger radicals left their jobs and fled to the forests, rate of disappearances from the towns, already high in late 1967 increased as rural revolt flared up in early 1968.Kiernan, 1982, p.186 A period of planning, preparation and communication between CPK cadres in various regions of Kampuchea (each of which had their own regional Party committee) supposedly continued until 17 January 1968,By 1968, the unrest had spread to many other provinces, where another 5000 or more people took to the forest when the ‚Äúreal action‚Äù got underway as the first attack was launched by the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea (RAK)The PKK dates the founding of the RAK to the 17 January 1968 attack where the party‚Äôs secret defense units were formed into guerilla units (Jackson, 2014, p.19) on a military post at a place called Baydamram, in Battambang Province where several wooden bridges were burnt by the Khmer RougeJackson, 2014, p.19Speech by Nuon Chea, Phnom Penh Radio, January 17, 1977, Foreign Broadcasts Information Service, Asia and Pacific: Daily Reports (Springfield, Va.: National Technical Information Service (hereafter FBIS), January 19, 1977, p. H2. This was followed by a series of clashes between troops and rebels, rebel ambushes on government military outposts, attacks on provincial guards, the stealing of rifles and weapons and the rounding up of families from villages who followed rebels into the forests ‚Äìwith a successful attack occurring on 25 January as rebels rounded up around 500 families from Thvak, Chisang, Beng Khtum and Samlaut.Kiernan, 1982, p.182-183 Rebels were active and widespread, with several rebel camp hide-outs set up in the forested areas throughout Battambang, carefully provisioned and fortified. It soon became evident to Sihanouk and Lon Nol that the outbreaks in early 1968 had been well-prepared and more serious than the initial outbreak in Samlaut in April 1967, showing signs of matured leadership by men like Khieu Samphan, Hou You and Hu Nim.Kiernan, 1982, p.182-183 Furthermore, signs of unrest were also spotted in northeastern provinces like RatanakiriThis region was particularly sensitive to communist influence as the Pathet Lao and Vietn Minh had been developing there for years, exploiting the discontent of the highlanders and turning them against the government. (Martin, 1994, p. 144) as land was being taken by the government to set up rubber plantations.Martin, 1994, p.114 In late January, Sihanouk brought back Lon Nol in response to the rising unrest in Battambang as the Minister of Defence and Inspector-General of the Armed Forces.Kiernan, 1982, p.184 Fighting continued to persist with increasing intensity from both sides until 25 February 1968, when the Khmer Rouge launched their most widespread and successful campaign yet.Kiernan, 1982, p.188 According to Sihanouk, ‚Äòthe blow of 25 February‚Äô was an operation ordered and coordinated by the Khmer Rouge command consisting of a few intellectuals executing a concerted operation against isolated troops where the same movements and tactics were employed in Battambang, Pursat, Takeo, Kampot, Koh Kong, Kompong Chhnang and Kirirom, resulting in more than 10,000 villagers from all over taking to the forests to join the rebellion as a result of the years of propaganda work.Kiernan, 1982, p.188 By March 1968, general conditions that prevailed almost everywhere made it suitable for the development of a mass- based revolutionary insurrection. This led to the replacement of provincial leaders with military officials and the harsh counter-forces of Lon Nol including the use of air force to bomb targeted rebel camps in the jungle.Kiernan, 1982, p.189 Not wanting to accede to the requests of the Khmer Rouge for a liberated zone (withdrawal of government troops from all villages and provinces where the Khmer Rouge are located) under the exclusive control and administration of the resistance, the rebellion continued to intensify throughout March. However, the situation started to turn bleak for the Khmer Rouge, suffering heavier losses against an increasingly consolidated and violent army who destroyed their camps and supplies, and a mobilized group of townspeople who supported Sihanouk and went against the peasants.Kiernan, 1982, p.189 On 8 April, an important Khmer Rouge network consisting of two large fortified hide-outs and important installations including a rifle factory at Phnom Veay Chap were destroyed by the army.Kiernan, 1982, p.192 With the destruction of the Khmer Rouge base and growing number of casualties and captures, an increasing number of peasants began to surrender and return to their villages, concluding the series of 1968 revolts, at least for the time being.Jackson, 2014, p.20 Ultimately, all these measures served to increase the rural population's isolation from and resentment of the government, military and the urban elite, strengthening support for the revolutionaries as dissidence continued to persist in the following years. Consequences, Implications & Significance of the rebellion down the road for Cambodia Although most of the 10,000 or so peasants involved in the February 1968 exodus to the maquis returned to their villages by April and May, the Khmer Rouge still benefitted from a degree of popular support and protection. According to Charles Meyer, after 1967, the Khmer Rouge armed propanganda teams circulated in nearly all the villages in Kampuchea.Le Sangkum, October 1968, p.197 Since the suppression of their forces, rebels in southern Battambang began to move south-east to link up with the Khmer Rouge in other provinces like Pursat, Kompong Chhnang and Kampong Speu.Realites Cambodgiennes, 26 April 1968, p. 22 By mid-1968, they had established a network of bases, calls and lines of communication throughout Kampuchea.Kiernan, 1982, p.193 The RAK obtained minimal assistance from the North Vietnamese, the VC and the Chinese. Although North Vietnam had established a special unit in 1966 to train the CPK, it was extremely reluctant to alienate Sihanouk at a time when vital supplies were passing through the port of Sihanoukville and along the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the VC bases along the Cambodia-Vietnam border.Heder, 1979 Beijing and Moscow also were providing Sihanouk with arms, many of which were being used against the insurgents. Perhaps, the indifference of the world communist movement to the Cambodian struggle since early 1967 made a permanent impression on Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders, shaping their isolated and self-sufficient vision of Democratic Kampuchea. Sihanouk's policies, economically and politically oppressive Sangkum Regime, condoning of Lon Nol's brutal response to peasant unrest, and initial ignorance of the localized context of the rebellion had paved the way for Cambodia's increasing politicization of significant numbers of peasants, contributing to the growing Cambodian civil war and influenced the ideological groundings behind Democratic Kampuchea. Such growing dissidence from the beginnings of April 1967 was capitalized on and organized in the 1968 revolts, eventually leading to the growing establishment of the Khmer Rouge-led peasant rebellion that manifested in 1970.By early 1970, the Khmer Rouge had reached a point of frustration as they had stymied a large section of the nation‚Äôs armed forces, but still failed to constitute a major military threat to the government (Kiernan, 1982, p.196) when Sihanouk's regime was overthrown by Lon Nol's March 1970 Coup.

Recovered between 1946 and 1948, the bodies of a man and two women have been dated to the Nordic Bronze Age. In 1891, the Gundestrup cauldron was found in a nearby bog. Borremose man The Borremose Man around the time of his discovery Scheme of Borremose Man's preserved body parts shortly after his discovery in 1946: red = fractures, beige = soft tissue, grey/white = bones. In 1946, Borremose man was discovered by peat diggers in the southernmost part of Borremose. First thought to be a murder victim, the body was later determined to be a bog body. The body was found a half metre down beneath a layer of birch sticks. The body was naked and two sheepskin coats and a woven cap lay beside it. Forensic analysis estimated the man's height at and carbon dating placed the age of the body at c. 700 BCE.Coles, B. & Coles, J., People of the wetlands. Bogs, bodies and lake- dwellers. Guild publishing. London, 1989 Borremose Man was found with a rope with a slipknot around his neck indicating death by strangulation. However, examination also revealed a crushing blow to the back of the skull and the right femur had been broken. Borremose II Borremose II In 1947, a body was discovered in the Borremose bog about one kilometre away from the Borremose Man. The corpse is believed to be female, although decomposition made it difficult to be sure. The bog body was lying face down deep on a base of birch bark. In the immediate vicinity were birch branches; directly on the body were three approximately birch poles of the same thickness. The skull was fractured and the brain was visible. The upper torso was naked while the lower body was covered by a cloak made of a four layered twill fabric and a fringed shawl. These two articles of clothing are now on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. It is uncertain if the body had been clothed at the time it had been deposited, because the clothing from plant materials such as flax fibers can be passed in the acidic peat. A leather cord with an amber bead and bronze plate were around the neck. The skull was crushed and the right leg was broken below the knee. The bones of an infant and a ceramic jar were lying nearby. Because the body was largely decayed, further forensic analysis was hampered. Later carbon dating placed the age of the remains to about 400 BCE. Borremose Woman The Borremose Woman around the time of her discovery The body of another woman (known as Borremose III or Borremose Woman) was recovered in 1948, approximately south from Borremose man. Her approximate age range at the time of death was 20‚Äì35 years old. Borremose Woman was found lying face down, the body wrapped in a woolen garment. The scalp and hair on one side of the head had been separated; however, this was considered to be damage caused by the shovels of the peat diggers. The skull and face were crushed, and deterioration of the neck prevented detection of strangulation. Re-examination showed that the damage to the skull had happened after death and was caused by demineralization of the bones as well as pressure from the peat. Carbon dating set the body's age to ca. 770 (+/-100) BCE.Andersen, S., Geertinger, P., \\"Bog bodies investigated in the light of forensic medicine.\\" Journal of Danish archaeology Vol. 3 1984, s. 111-119. In 1984, a forensic examination of Borremose Woman was undertaken by Andersen and Geert Inger and Elisabeth Munksgaard of the Natural History Museum in Copenhagen. Their examination confirmed that damage to the scalp had not occurred before death. The scientists were unable to make any conclusion as to the cause of death whether by murder, suicide, accident or natural causes.

Shantry played for Shropshire Under-17s as early as July 2004, scoring 64 at the top of the order against Yorkshire Under-17s. He made several further appearances for Shropshire Under-17s, and also played for Shrewsbury Cricket Club, appearing in the Cockspur Cup and making an appearance against Kidderminster Victoria in the Birmingham and District Premier League. In 2007 and 2008, Shantry progressed to a mixture of senior cricket at minor counties level with Shropshire County Cricket Club and Second XI cricket for Worcestershire. He took 7/34 for Worcestershire Second XI against Leicestershire II in June 2008, and scored 88 for Shropshire against Wales Minor Counties in August of the same year. Between these two feats, in July, he had appeared for Shropshire in the final of the Resource Bank Twenty20 Cup, which they lost to a star-studded Lashings World XI side despite Shantry's 3/11. Shantry made his senior debut for Worcestershire in a Pro40 match against Essex at Colchester on 23 August 2009, taking the wicket of Ravi Bopara and not batting. Two days later, he made his maiden appearance in first-class cricket when he was selected for Worcestershire's County Championship clash with Nottinghamshire at New Road. In a drawn game, Shantry claimed the wickets of Bilal Shafayat and Mark Ealham, but was lbw for nought in his only innings. He retained his place in the side in both one-day and four-day cricket, and so his club cricket appearances, now for Walsall, became less frequent. Shantry pressed his claims for a regular place in the side in his first game of the 2010 season, a non- first-class warm-up match against Bradford/Leeds UCCE. He claimed 5‚Äì18 in the first innings, and opened the bowling in the second innings, taking a wicket with the first ball of the innings and finishing with 7‚Äì47, to complete a match haul of 12 wickets for 65. Worcestershire went on to win the game. In May 2010 he took his first first-class five wickets in an innings, recording 5‚Äì49 against Leicestershire at Grace Road. In September 2014, he scored his maiden first-class century (and took ten wickets in a first-class match for the first time) in a victory over Surrey that guaranteed Worcestershire promotion to Division 1. In June 2018, Shantry announced his retirement from all cricket with immediate effect, due to ongoing back injuries.

Though the city was fiercely bombarded, the French successfully withstood the Austrian attack in the action. Because the Austrians were unable to completely encircle the city, the French were able to continuously send in reinforcements. After news of the French victory over the Prussians at Valmy, Albert withdrew his troops and siege cannons. The next battle was at Jemappes in November. The Column of the Goddess monument was completed in 1845 to commemorate the siege. Historic defenses After the Kingdom of France captured Lille in 1668, the famous military engineer S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban was ordered to improve its defenses. The five-sided citadel was constructed between 1668 and 1672 at a cost of 1,500,000 florins and the result was announced by Vauban to be the \\"Queen of Citadels\\". The citadel was surrounded by marshes, except where it adjoined the city, and was protected by two flooded ditches and two covered ways. In 1670, parts of the old walls were torn down to make room for new fortifications. When the work was done, Lille was protected by 16 bastions and four hornworks. Vauban estimated that 12,000 soldiers were required to defend the huge fortifications, including 1,000 manning the citadel. The four-month 1708 Siege of Lille ended in the city's surrender to Prince Eugene of Savoy and John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough when the garrison of Louis Fran√ßois, duc de Boufflers ran out of gunpowder. Background On 19 August, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette left his command at the Army of the North and entered Coalition territory with 22 members of his staff. On 17 August, the increasingly radicalized French Legislative Assembly had demanded that La Fayette report to Paris for questioning and on the 19th he was charged with treason. Not understanding that his domestic enemies wanted to guillotine him, the Prussians and Austrians imprisoned La Fayette until 1797. His replacement in army command was the more astute Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez. Dumouriez dreamed of an immediate invasion of the Austrian Netherlands, but events soon forced him to hold off on that plan. On 24 August, the politically-connected Fran√ßois Joseph Westermann arrived at headquarters with the news that Longwy had fallen to the Coalition the day before after a feeble defense. After calling Anne Fran√ßois Augustin de La Bourdonnaye from the command of Lille to lead the northern wing of the Army of the North, Dumouriez headed south with Westermann and his aide-de-camp Jacques MacDonald. Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel at the head of 42,000 Prussians was supported on his right by Fran√ßois S√©bastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt with 15,000 Austrians and on his left by Friedrich Wilhelm, F√ºrst zu Hohenlohe- Kirchberg with 14,000 Austrians. The Coalition forces bombarded Longwy into submission then gained a quick triumph in the Battle of Verdun on 2 September. At last Dumouriez realized that Brunswick might be headed to Paris and marched his available troops to Grandpr√© in the Prussian's path. He also ordered Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville to join him with 10,000 soldiers from the Army of the North and Blaise Duval to bring 3,050 more. The Battle of Valmy occurred on 20 September, after which Brunswick withdrew from France. With Dumouriez absent, the French only had 6,000 troops under Ren√© Joseph Lanoue to defend Maubeuge. There were 4,000 soldiers led by Jacques Henri Moreton Chabrillant spread between Bruille-Saint-Amand, Saint-Amand-les-Eaux and Orchies as well as 4,000‚Äì5,000 men in the Camp of Maulde. Duke Albert of Saxe-Teschen decided to divert French strength away from Brunswick's invasion by launching attacks on the enemies before him. Saxe-Teschen counted 51 infantry battalions and 40 cavalry squadrons of which 14 battalions were in garrisons. On 3 September Anton Szt√°ray threatened Philippeville while Johann Peter Beaulieu menaced Qui√©vrain. When Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour advanced from Tournai toward Lille on 5 September, Moreton abandoned the Camp of Maulde and fell back behind the Scarpe River. Latour pursued and pounced on the French at Mortagne-du-Nord, routing them. The defeated soldiers tried to lynch Moreton but he managed to talk them out of it. Moreton later complained that many of his troops were uncontrollable and became drunk or looted houses in Saint-Amand. Radical journalist Louis-Marie Prudhomme accused Moreton of either incompetence or treason. Siege Seeing the panic that his attacks had caused, Saxe-Teschen decided to besiege Lille. On 16 September, he added troops from Beaulieu's division at Mons to Latour's division from Tournai, bringing up the total to approximately 15,000 men and 50 guns. Saxe- Teschen set out from Tournai to join the besiegers on 25 September. Lille was one of the most powerful of the barrier fortresses, with a well-supplied garrison of 3,000 regular infantry under Jean-Baptiste Andr√© Ruault de La Bonnerie. The defenders were quickly reinforced to a strength of 10,000 men. The Austrian effort was handicapped by the fact that their siege train was too small and their army was too weak to entirely surround Lille. Consequently, the French were able to bring in reinforcements without hindrance. The citizen bucket brigades during the bombardment. On 24 September, the Austrians pushed back the French outposts and commenced digging trenches that night. The first parallel was laid out across the main highway to Tournai and five batteries with a total of 30 artillery pieces were spaced 200 paces apart. After rejecting Saxe-Teschen's summons to surrender, the energetic Ruault mounted sorties every night but was unable to halt progress on the siege works. On 29 September, the Austrian batteries opened a devastating bombardment upon the buildings of Lille with shot, shell and hot-shot. Fires were set in the city but citizen bucket brigades kept the damage in check. The cannons of the defenders returned a heavy volume of fire. Ruault was soon reinforced to 25,000 men, a force considerably outnumbering the besiegers. By 3 October the Austrian bombardment began to noticeably taper off. On 3 October, the citizen captain Charlemagne Ovigneur continued to serve his gun even though he knew his house was burning and his wife was going to give birth. On 4 October, Saxe-Teschen's wife, Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen appeared in the Austrian camp and the bombardment was redoubled. By this time, Saxe-Teschen became aware of Brunswick's retreat as well as the increasing numbers of French troops opposing him. On 6 October the Habsburg commander directed that the heavy siege guns be removed from the batteries. By this time 60,000 shot and shell had been fired into Lille. The Austrians evacuated the trenches on 8 October and withdrew almost unmolested in the face of a weak pursuit led by F√©lix Marie Pierre Chesnon de Champmorin. The inhabitants of Lille emerged from their town and, in their rage at the destruction, leveled the Austrian siege works. The victory was celebrated throughout France and caused many men to enlist in the armies. Forces Duke of Saxe-Teschen Ruault's 10,000-man garrison consisted of two battalions of the 85th Line Infantry Regiment, one battalion each of the 15th, 86th and 100th Line, the depots of battalions of the 24th, 44th, 56th and 90th Line, one National Guard battalion and the depots of three National Guard battalions and depot squadrons of the 3rd and 6th Cavalry Regiments. Other reinforcements came into the city during the siege. Since the summer of 1792, Charles Fran√ßois Duhoux was the commander of Lille but he was ordered to take charge of the Camp of Soissons, just before the start of the siege. Even so, he returned to Lille on 23 September to assume command but a few days later he was suspended and ordered to report to Paris. Instead, he remained in Lille during the siege, not arriving in Paris until 10 October. He was attacked in newspaper articles but defended himself by arguing that leaving Lille during the siege would have been cowardly. The Austrians besieged Lille with 13,800 troops in battalions, six companies and 18 squadrons. The siege train included 52 cannons, howitzers and mortars. Saxe-Teschen organized his army into three divisions under Latour, Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of W√ºrttemberg and Beaulieu, each with one brigade. Latour's division had the brigade of Franz Xaver von Wenckheim, which included the Leeuven and Rousseau Grenadier Battalions and two battalions of Szt√°ray Nr. 33 Infantry Regiment. W√ºrttemberg's division controlled Szt√°ray's brigade which was composed of the 1st Battalion of the Clerfayt Nr. 9 and 2nd Battalion of the Alton Nr. 15 Infantry Regiments and the P√ºckler Grenadier Battalion. Beaulieu's division directed the brigade of Karl von Biela which had the 1st Battalions of the Ligne Nr. 30 and Murray Nr. 55 Infantry Regiments, the 2nd Battalion of the Josef Colloredo Nr. 57 Infantry Regiment and four companies of the O'Donell Freikorps. Louis-Fran√ßois, Count of Civalart d'Happoncourt led a cavalry brigade with two squadrons of the Blankenstein Hussars Nr. 16 and seven squadrons of the Latour Chevau-l√©gers Nr. 31. Charles Eugene, Prince of Lambesc led a second cavalry brigade which included two squadrons of the Wurmser Hussars Nr. 30 and six squadrons of Degelmann Freikorps Uhlans. Karl Friedrich von Lindenau commanded one company each of sappers and pontonniers. One squadron and one-half battalion are not accounted for in the list. Results Column of the Goddess One source estimated French military losses as 100‚Äì200 dead and wounded. The Austrians reported 43 dead and 161 wounded and 20 siege cannons either burst or became unusable from continuous firing. The Austrians really had no chance of capturing such a strong fortress. Ruault reported to the government that one- fourth of the houses in Lille were burnt. The political commissioners asserted that 500 houses were destroyed and another 2,000 damaged; the Church of Saint- √âtienne was wrecked. One writer suggested that the damage was exaggerated for political purposes. Prudhomme attacked Duhoux in print for disobeying orders and Bourdonnaye for not relieving Lille sooner. With Brunswick in full retreat, Dumouriez noticed that the large forces assembled to defend Lille could now be used for his pet project to invade Belgium. He secured permission from the French government to undertake his offensive and soon massed 80,000‚Äì100,000 troops for the purpose. Saxe-Teschen faced a very dangerous situation. The next major action was the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792.

Originally part of I≈£cani village (now a suburb of Suceava), it is located at No. 4, GƒÉrii Street. The railway station was included on the 2004 list of historical monuments in Suceava County. History The station prior to 1918 Between 1870 and 1871, at a time when it was included in Austro-Hungarian Empire, Suceava was connected by a railway line through the I≈£cani station to other important cities of Bukovina region, and through the Burdujeni station with the Kingdom of Romania. The I≈£cani station building (now Suceava North) was raised by two Austrian entrepreneurs C. Gall and F. Ronchetti, builders of the Roman‚ÄîBurdujeni‚ÄîI≈£cani‚ÄîChernowitz rail line, was commissioned in 1871. The station is a building with two levels, following the blueprint of other Austrian railway stations located in Central European areas, in neo-romantic style marked by a rectangular plane, ogive-arched vaults, broken-key arcs and arches and battlements and corner towers in Gothic Revival style. Until 1918, when Bukovina was joined with Romania, the station served as an important railway hub for passenger traffic and cargo transit within both Austria‚ÄìHungary and Romania. It was the border point between Romania and Austria-Hungary on the Cisleithanian side, while in Romania the corresponding station was Suceava Station (Burdujeni). From 1881 until 1902, when modernization works were carried out at Burdujeni station (building of an upper floor and two side pavilions), Romania's government leased half of the I≈£cani station from the Austrian authorities, to use as a customs station at the old frontier. In the same period a locomotive depot was built near the station that was one of the largest in Bukovina. On September 11, 2007, the I≈£cani station was chosen to be a filming site of a movie sequence from Gruber's Journey, directed by Radu Gabrea, which starred Romanian actors Florin Piersic Jr. and Claudiu Bleon»õ, as well as German actor Udo Schenk. The railway station was chosen to appear in the film because its architecture was reminiscent of the period of World War II. By 2009 however, the building had reportedly fallen into neglect, and health inspectors fined the local Romanian Railways authority 1,000 lei for allowing refuse to pile up on the grounds.

Georgia School for the Deaf (GSD) is a public residential school for the deaf. GSD provides comprehensive education and services to deaf and hard-of-hearing students between the ages of three and twenty-two. Located in Cave Spring, Georgia, United States, the school offers day and residential programs which meet the academic, social and physical needs of students in a bilingual (American Sign Language and English) environment. It was established in 1846 and is one of three public state schools operated by the Georgia Department of Education.  History  Located in Northwest Georgia near Rome, Georgia School for the Deaf is in the scenic Vann's Valley. It is Georgia's only residential school serving Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students. GSD was established in 1846 on the grounds of the Hearn Academy by one of its teachers, O. P. Fannin. A log cabin, a $5000 legislative grant, and four students began a more than 170-years-long tradition of service to children across the state. GSD was the eleventh residential school for the deaf established in the United States. Campus GSD has an extensive campus of almost in the small community of Cave Spring. The relationship between Cave Spring and GSD is one-of-a-kind because many residents and business owners are able to communicate with American Sign Language. GSD is currently based on the Perry Farm, just outside of Cave Spring, but was originally located in Downtown Cave Spring in what is now the Cave Spring City Hall. Mission statement > All GSD students will graduate with a positive Deaf identity as bilinguals > in American Sign Language and English and will be prepared to make > successful life choices. Vision \\"The Georgia School for the Deaf offers high quality educational and extracurricular activities that prepare its graduates for further academic, social, and career success. This is achieved in a fully-accessible American Sign Language (ASL)/English bilingual environment, which recognizes ASL users as a distinct cultural and linguistic group. This fosters a positive self-acceptance and self-esteem, affording each student the ability to effectively navigate the world they encounter beyond their K-12 experience. As part of this lifelong learning philosophy, all staff and students consistently strive to improve their use of both ASL and written English.\\"  Residential students  GSD's residential program allows students to access and experience Deaf culture, a unique cultural and linguistic identity. They create long- lasting friendships, develop appropriate social skills, and can be involved in sports and after-school activities. Students are transported to their homes every weekend.  Athletics  Georgia School for the Deaf has a varsity basketball team for girls and boys, a football team, a soccer team, and a volleyball team. The female and male varsity basketball teams at GSD compete in the Mason-Dixon Tournament yearly. In 2008 the GSD Lady Tigers won the Mason-Dixon Tournament; it was their first win since 1980. The GSD football team competes against deaf and hearing schools. They use their hearing disadvantage to their benefit by using sign language in their huddles and mental rhythmic plays.  Athletes  Willie Brown played basketball at GSD. In his sophomore year he was 6'6\\" and averaged 28 points, 12 rebounds a game. He was voted the number one high school player in northwest Georgia. Brown holds the school record of 2,016 points over four years in basketball at GSD. After graduating, he pursued college basketball at Hofstra University in New York, where he played alongside hearing teammates.  Requirements  To be eligible for admission at GSD, students must be between the ages of 3 and 21 and have an audio-metric hearing loss of 55 dB or greater in the better ear.

Wessin led the military coup which ousted the government of Dominican President Juan Bosch in 1963, replacing it with a triumvirate. Wessin was also a key figure in the ensuing Dominican Civil War, which led to a United States military intervention into and occupation of the Dominican Republic in 1965. Early life General Elias Wessin (Wazen) Street in Dekwaneh, Lebanon. Wessin was born in Bayaguana, Monte Plata Province, Dominican Republic, on July 22, 1924. His parents were immigrants from the coastal town of Dekwaneh in Lebanon. The family name in Lebanon as it is used today is spelt Wazen, a phonetic variant of the name in Lebanese Arabic. Wessin's career in the Dominican Air Force began as a military pilot. Career Wessin's first intervention in Dominican politics as an air force officer began in 1961, following the assassination of President Rafael Trujillo, a dictator. Wessin, who commanded an infantry battalion at the time of Trujillo's assassination, helped Trujillo's wife and family to flee the country. During the Revolution, Wessin refused to abandon his post because he did not want the rebels, whom he accused of being pro- communist, to take over the country. This was partly why the U.S tended towards the loyalist (Wessin's forces), and not towards Francisco Caama√±o, who was acting in the behalf of Juan Bosch. Wessin was allowed to return from exile in 1978 after the government issued a general amnesty. He reconciled with his former political rival, President Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, and actively campaigned for Balaguer during the 1986 presidential election. Due to his support for Balaguer, Wessin served as the country's Interior Minister and, later, as Secretary of the Armed Forces during Balaguer's administrations.

It consists of several acres of large sandstone boulders; the average size is high. Every boulder has its own unique features, all with great foot and hand holds and very popular with climbers. The area presents challenges for all levels of climbers. There is a one-mile hike from the trail head to get to the Rocktown area. Most of these boulders are untainted by pollution and graffiti because it is in a remote part of northwest Georgia. However, in recent years as the climbing community has become increasingly aware of the area it has become more common to see trash, human waste, damaged or abandoned climbing gear, and vandalism. Because it is located in a wildlife management area, it is possible to encounter wild animals in this area, including both venomous and non- venomous snakes, bobcats, deer, wild turkeys, black bears. When climbing and exploring the boulders, caves and grottoes it is common to encounter wasps, yellow-jackets and spiders and even the occasional bat. \\"Rock Town\\" refers to the large outcropping approximately one(1) mile from the trailhead. Which opens into a large gallery with 5 main pathways off. This area has hundreds of spectacular formations, the entrance to a large cave, and 2 natural springs. The Rocktown trail and area is closed annually during scheduled deer hunts. These formations are typical of those found in and around the Rocktown area. Location Once a preciously guarded secret among locals and a small collection of climbing enthusiasts, Rocktown trail is located on top of Pigeon Mountain in extreme Northwest Georgia. It is part of the Crockford Pigeon Mountain Wildlife Management Area and is administered by the Department of Natural Resources, Wildlife Resources Division of the State of Georgia. It is northwest of Atlanta Georgia, and just south of Chattanooga, Tennessee. The town closest to the trail is LaFayette, Georgia. To access Crockford Pigeon Mountain WMA, one must possess a hunting or fishing license or a Georgia Lands Pass.

The bulk of the original texts date from the third and fourth centuries. The Lives that were originally written in Greek were translated into Latin between the fourth and the seventh century. An Italian vernacular translation was made by Dominican friar Domenico Cavalca from Pisa at the beginning of the fourteenth century. A printed edition, edited by the Jesuit Heribert Rosweyde, was printed by Balthazar Moret in 1615. The book is a significant part of the much broader work, Acta Sanctorum. The Vitae Patrum is based on extensive research by Rosweyde into all the available literature he could find on the early desert monastics. Hippolyte Delehaye described the work as \\"the epic of the origins of monasticism in Egypt and Syria, an epic unsurpassed in interest and grandeur.\\" In the thirteenth century, a version of Vitae Patrum had been translated into Latin. It was such a popular book that numerous versions and editions were published, with extensive changes and variations in the stories. Rosweyde based his book on twenty-three different versions of those earlier books, studying, dating, and classifying all the different versions and changes. Rosweyde's Vitae Patrum consists of ten books. Book I has the lives of sixteen saints under the title Vitae virorum and eleven saints under the title Vitae mulierum, beginning with St. Paul the Hermit and St. Anthony of the Desert, and including women saints such as Saint Mary the Harlot. Books II, Historia monachorum, and III, Verba seniorum (Sayings of the Elders), are attributed to Rufinus, who was later found to be only their translator. Book IV is a compilation of writings by Sulpicius Severus and John Cassian. Book V is another collection of Verba seniorum from Latin and Greek by Pelagius. Book VI and Book VII are further collections of Verba seniorum (Sayings of the Elders) by unknown Greek authors translated by John the subdeacon, possibly Pope John III, and by Paschasius. Book VIII is a text that was previously known as The Paradise of Heraclides, but which Rosweyde attributed to its real author, Palladius, and titled the Lausiac History. Book IX is De Vitis Patrum by Theodoret. Book X is The Spiritual Meadow of Moschus. Rosweyde wrote an introduction to each book.

Campbell's discovery, that blindness in premature babies was caused by high concentrations of oxygen, resulted in the alteration of the treatment of premature babies world-wide and for this she received global recognition.  Biography   Family  Born in Hawthorn, Melbourne to Scottish-born Donald Campbell, a clerk, and his wife, New Zealand-born Janet Duncan (n√©e Mill), a former school teacher. Campbell was the third of four siblings. Her youngest brother Donald was the barrister who defended Frank Hardy in the Power without Glory trial.  Education  Despite Campbell's parents' appreciation for an education, the family's low financial situation meant her elder two brothers left school early. Campbell attended the Manningtree Road Primary School and while attending she was awarded a Junior Program Government Scholarship to the Methodist Ladies College, Melbourne. Later in 1917, she was provided a Senior Government Scholarship which enabled her to continue further studies at the University of Melbourne. Campbell completed her MBBS in 1922 and her MD in 1924. She graduated from medical school with luminaries such as (Sir) Frank Macfarlane Burnet and (Dame) Jean Macnamara, as well as Lucy Meredith Bryce, Rupert Willis and George Simpson.  Career  After graduating from her MBBS (1922), alongside Dr Jean Macnamara, she was admitted to residency at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. At the hospital, female residents where habitually inhibited in their responsibilities by being restricted to less critical cases and being excluded from involvement in casualty duty. Campbell and Macnamara decided that they needed more experience and exposure in child and maternal health and so decided on moving to the Royal Children's Hospital where they became one of the first few female resident medical staff. However, initially the Children's Hospital had been claiming to lack the facilities needed to accommodate the female doctors. It was only until (Sir) William Upjohn pleaded Campbell and Macnamara's special case with the hospital's board that they received the positions. In future years, Upjohn boasted \\"that [his] entry to heaven was assured by the fact that [he] got Jean Macnamara and Kate Campbell on at the Children's\\". It was stated by the Australian Dictionary of Biography that it was while holding a two-year-old girl's hand at the Children's Hospital that Campbell realised she wanted to specialise in children's health. Due to gender discrimination in her work place, Campbell resigned and became the first honorary paediatrician at the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne from 1924 to 1927 where she filled the position of the Resident Medical Officer. In 1927, Campbell established her own general medical practise in Essendon, Melbourne. She worked there for a decade. Coinciding with working at her general medical practise, she worked closely with Dr. Vera Scantlebury Brown who was introducing aspects of child welfare in Australia. Campbell and Brown knew each other previously from completing their Doctorates of Medicine (1924) at the University of Melbourne together. When Brown toured New Zealand to investigate the various infant care methods of Dr.Truby King, Campbell had assumed the training of infant welfare nurses which Brown had been responsible for. This was the initiation of Campbell's lifelong association with the Victorian Baby Health Centres Association, for which she was a medical officer for until 1965. Through the role of medical officer, the responsibilities were to visit centres throughout Victoria and act as examiner for the State Infant Welfare Certificate. Campbell and Brown wrote a book called A Guide to the Care of the Young Child (1947), which remained the standard reference textbook for sisters of infant welfare until 1972. Despite sexism and discrimination against females then seeking medical careers, Campbell was named as \\"honorary paediatrician\\" to the Queen Victoria Hospital in 1926, resigning from the role in 1965. From 1929-1965, alongside Campbell's responsibilities as medical officer, she was appointed the first clinical lecturer for the University of Melbourne in infant welfare, specialising in neonatal paediatrics. Through her lectures she educated a multitude of future doctors. In 1965 until she retired in 1979, she filled the position of Consultant Paediatrician at the Queen Victoria Hospital.  Research and discoveries  Janet McCalman, Australian historian, described Campbell as having \\"clinical sensitivity, epidemiological curiosity and being meticulous\\"; qualities of which translated into evolving research on neonatal intensive care and a range of important advances in the medicine of newborns. Her research led to the creation of various reports, some of which regarding: infection control, neonatal feeding, neonatal jaundice in premature infants, electrolyte and fluid tolerance in newborns and also the effects of trauma in delivery. Through all these investigations and research, she became a specialist in children's diseases. Campbell's most distinguished contribution in research was, in 1951, in establishing and proving that excess therapeutic oxygen in humidicribs acquired retrolental fibroplasia \\\\- a condition which could lead to blindness in premature babies.  Honours  For her contribution to children welfare, she was awarded: * Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) (1 January 1954) * Co- winner with (Sir) Norman Gregg in being awarded the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica award for medicine (1964). * From the University of Melbourne, an Honorary Doctorate of Laws (LLD). (1966) This was also awarded to Dr. Jean Macnamara. This was the first time that the university had awarded the degree to females who were not of royalty. * Appointed to the (Dame Commander) Order of the British Empire (DBE) (1 January 1971). * Inducted to Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001.  Affiliations  * Honorary fellow (1961) of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. * First female president (1965‚Äì66) of the Australian Paediatric Association. * Member of the Lyceum Club.  Death  Dame Kate Isabel Campbell retired in 1979 and died on 12 July 1986, aged 87, after a long illness. She died at Camberwell, Melbourne and was cremated. She never married.  Legacy  * The Kate Campbell Scholarship * The Royal Women's Hospital executive medical staff and staff of the University's Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology donated ¬£500 in 1961 for the Dr Kate Campbell Prize in Neonatal Paediatrics.

The British captured her in 1800 and commissioned her as a sloop-of-war. She served at the Battle of Algeciras Bay before the Navy sold her in 1802. She underwent repairs and reappears as a merchantman in the 1805 registers; however, she wrecked at the Dardanelles in 1805. Capture Francis Beaufort On 25 October 1800 the frigate chased a Spanish polacca to an anchorage under a battery of five heavy guns at Fuengirola, where she joined a French privateer brig. The following night the brig escaped while the polacca tried twice, unsuccessfully, to escape to M√°laga. On the night of 27 October, Francis Beaufort, later inventor of the Beaufort Wind-Scale, led Phaeton's boats on a cutting out expedition. Unfortunately the launch, with a carronade, was unable to keep up and was still out of range when a French privateer schooner, which had come into the anchorage unseen, fired on the other boats. The barge and two cutters immediately made straight for the polacca. The boarding party suffered one man killed and three wounded, including Beaufort who received, but survived, 19 wounds.In November 1801 the Navy awarded Beaufort a pension of ¬£45 12s. 6d. per annum for his wounds. The boarding party succeeded in securing the polacca by 5 am. The captured ship was San Jos√©, alias Aglies, of 14 guns. She had been employed as a packet, carrying provisions between M√°laga and Velilla. She had a crew of 34 seamen and there were also 22 soldiers on board. The Spanish sustained at least 13 wounded. The British immediately commissioned San Jos√© as a British sloop-of-war under the name of Calpe, the ancient name of Gibraltar. Although it would have been usual to promote Beaufort, the successful and heroic leader of the expedition, to command Calpe, Lord Keith chose Commander George Dundas instead, who not only was not present at the battle, but was junior to Beaufort.James (1837) Vol. 3, 55. British service When Calpe was first commissioned in the Royal Navy there were insufficient Royal Marines available for her. As a stop-gap, she received a mixed detachment of 22 Army troops from the Gibraltar Garrison, the Royal Artillery, 5th and 63rd Foot, Cambrian Rangers, and the Argyll, Banffshire and Prince of Wales' Own Fencibles, all under the command of an officer from the 5th Foot. Even after the marines arrived, the troops stayed aboard for some more months.Haythornthwaite et al., (1993), 52. Calpe shared with a number of warships in the capture of Eurydice on 9 February 1801. Battle of Algeciras Bay By 1 July 1801 she was at Gibraltar. While there she observed the arrival of a French squadron. On 5 July, at 2 a.m., Lieutenant Richard Janvarin, whom Dundas had dispatched from Gibraltar, joined Rear Adm. James Saumarez in in a boat, and informed Sir James of the appearance of the French squadron off the Rock.James (1837), 113. (left foreground) lies aground and dismasted at the Battle of Algeciras Bay. On 6 July Saumarez sailed from Gibraltar with Caesar, , , , and with the intention of attacking Admiral Linois's squadron of three French line-of-battle ships and a frigate, which were lying a considerable distance from the batteries at Algeciras. As Venerable, the leading ship, approached the wind dropped and she was forced to anchor. Pompee managed to get into action but Hannibal grounded and was forced to strike. Dundas, deceived by a signal from Hannibal, sent his boats to save Hannibals crew. The French detained the boats and their crews, including Calpes lieutenant, Thomas Sykes; after firing several broadsides at the enemy's shipping and batteries, Calpe returned to Gibraltar.James (1837), 118. In the battle the British drove two of the French ships ashore and badly damaged the rest. The total loss in the British squadron was 121 killed, 240 wounded, and 14 missing. The Franco-Spanish force lost 317 men killed and some 3-500 wounded. On 8 July a squadron of five Spanish ships-of-the-line, a French 74, three frigates and a large number of gunboats reinforced the French ships. Hard work repaired all the British ships at Gibraltar, except Pompee in time for them to follow the Franco-Spanish fleet when it sailed on 12 July. In the subsequent second phase of the Battle of Algeciras Bay, the two first rates and fired upon each other during the night, caught fire and exploded, with tremendous loss of life. The British captured the third rate , with Superb and Calpe assisting afterwards in securing the prize and removing the prisoners.James (1837), 128. Calpe later shared in the prize money for St Antoines hull and provisions, and in the head money for St Antoine, Real Carlos, and San Hermenegildo. Dundas was made Post-captain on 9 August and took command of St Antoine, which he sailed back to England. Saumarez then appointed Lieutenant John Lamburn (or Lamborn), first lieutenant of Caesar, to command Calpe. However, the Admiralty did not confirm Saumarez's promotions, except that of Dundas. Among other decisions, it returned Lamburn to Caesar, and replaced him as captain of Calpe with Commander Phillip Dumaresque. (Dumaresque had been a lieutenant aboard Caesar and received his promotion in July when he arrived in London with Saumarez's dispatches.Ross (2008), 2, 9 and 30.)

Hakuto was named after the white rabbit in Japanese mythology. The team's original plan was to finance its lunar mission from advertising expenditure of large global companies and the team eventually succeeded in attracting sponsorship from multiple large brands, particularly in Japan.White Label Space team page on the Google Lunar X PRIZE site The team went through a number of phases of its organisation and plans. Initially the team was primarily a European effort and led in the Netherlands. Later the team changed management and was led in Japan. At different stages of the competition the team had partnerships with two other teams (Astrobotic and then Team Indus) for the delivery of its lunar rover to the Moon's surface. Although the competition ended without any team launching their mission, the Hakuto team became a company, struck partnerships, working agreements and became ispace.

In 2009, the team registered with the Google Lunar X PRIZE (GLXP).History team Hakuto, 2014 Throughout the period 2008 till 2010 the team established partnerships with a number of organisations, mostly in Europe, and White Label Space continued to publish its early progress on the developments of the lunar mission.

For most of the duration of the GLXP, the Hakuto rover was planned to be deployed from Astrobotic's the Peregrine lander, however for the final phase of the prize, with Astrobotic lacking a launch contract, Hakuto established a new agreement with Team Indus for launch and lunar surface delivery of the rover. That mission was to use the proven PSLV launcher of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Team Indus was subsequently confirmed by XPRIZE Foundation to have a valid launch contract and therefore both teams were eligible to remain in the prize beyond the launch contract cut-off date of end 2016.

That mission would have included Hakuto's Sorato rover being deployed on the lunar surface along with other smaller rovers, including Team AngelicvM's rover. The proposed landing site was Lacus Mortis. In August 2019, ispace announced a restructuring of its lunar program, which they call Hakuto-R. A significant change was the elimination of the technology demonstration orbiter mission in 2020 in favor of moving more quickly toward a demonstration of commercial lunar landing capabilities. Hakuto-R Mission 1 will include a lunar lander that is now scheduled for launch aboard a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket in October 2021.

The Labeatae (alternatively, Labeatai, ; also Labeates) were an Illyrian tribe that lived on the Adriatic coast of southern Illyria (modern Albania and Montenegro), around lake Labeatis.; ; ; Their territory seems to have stretched from Lissus at the river Drin in the south, or probably even from the valley of Mat, up to Meteon in the north. Their centre and main stronghold was Skodra, which during the last period of the Illyrian kingdom was the capital city.; ; The dynasty of the last Illyrian kings (Scerdilaidas, Pleuratus, Gentius) was Labeatan.; ; In Roman times the Labeatae minted coins bearing the inscription of their ethnicon. Name The name of the Labeatae is formed by the Lab- particle which is frequently found in the southern Illyrian onomastic area and the common Illyrian suffix -at(ae). The Lab- particle represents a metathesis from Alb- > Lab-, which itself could be related to the appearance of the ethnonym of the Albanians in the same area. It is present in hydronyms like the Lab river and toponyms like Llapashtic√´ along the later Roman route from Lissus to Ulpiana and indicates the movement of Illyrian tribes from the interior of Illyria to the coastline or vice versa. Geography Unlike other Illyrian tribes, the extent of the territory of the Labeatae can be determined with relative precision through some important literary informations from ancient sources. In the accounts of the Roman-Illyrian war involving Gentius, Livy ( 1st century BC ‚Äì 1st century AD) described the location of Skodra reporting that the Illyrian king was ruler of the Labeatae and referring to the Lake Shkodra as lacus Labeatium. The core of the Labeatan territory must therefore have been the area around this lake. In the description of the place where the envoy of Gentius and Perseus met in 168 BC, Polybius ( 2nd century BC) reports that the site of Meteon was located in the territory of the Labeatae. It was there that the Illyrian and Macedonian kings established an alliance against the Romans. Livy mentions Meteon as a \\"city of the Labeates\\", where at the end of the war Gentius' wife Etleuta, their two sons, and Gentius' brother Caravantius took refuge, implying that this city belonged to Labeatan territory until it was conquered by the Romans. Meteon can be considered as the northern border of Labeatan territory, beyond which Docleatan territory began encompassing the area between the rivers Zeta and Moraƒça. In the west the territory of Labeatae was bordered by the Adriatic sea, its eastern border was presumably marked by the Accursed Mountains. The southern border may be considered the site of Lissus at the mouth of the river Drin, beyond which stretched the region of the Taulantii. In Roman times Lissus was located in the territory of the Labeatae, however ancient sources never relate it with this tribe. Taking into account archaeological and historical considerations, the city of Lissus should have been founded in a Labeatan ethnos context, but perhaps by the time of queen Teuta's fall in the end of the 3rd century BC, it was organized as a proper polis separating from the context of the ethnos. The territory of the Labeatae comprised a number of relevant rivers, including Drin (Oriund), Buna (Barbana), Kiri (Klausali) and Moraƒça, and the alluvial plains surrounding the Lake Shkodra (lacus or palus Labeatis). However, the only navigable rivers in antiquity were Buna and Drin. After the Roman conquest of southern Illyria, the territory of the Illyrian realm of Gentius was separated into three parts. One of these areas coincided with the Labeatan region. Culture Language The idiom spoken by the tribe of Labeatae belonged to the southeastern Illyrian linguistic area. Religion Several cult-objects with similar features are found in different Illyrian regions, including the territory of the Illyrian tribes of Labeatae, Dassaretii, Daorsi, and comprising also the Iapodes. In particular, a 3rd century BC silvered bronze belt buckle, found inside the Illyrian Tombs of Sel√ßa e Poshtme near the western shore of Lake Lychnidus in Dassaretan territory, depicts a scene of warriors and horsemen in combat, with a giant serpent as a protector totem of one of the horsemen; a very similar belt was found also in the necropolis of Gostilj near the Lake Scutari in the territory of the Labeatae, indicating a common hero-cult practice in those regions. Modern scholars suggest that the iconographic representation of the same mythological event includes the Illyrian cults of the serpent, of Cadmus, and of the horseman, the latter being a common Paleo-Balkan hero. The cult of the serpent among the Labeatae is reflected also on their coinage: ships depicted with figureheads of serpents are often engraved on Labeatan coins. The serpents depicted on ships were related to the beliefs of the sailors that these animal totems would have safeguarded them from storms and enemies. The serpent was a powerful symbol among southern Illyrians, who attributed it an important role as a protector animal. Economy Skodra. The Labeates minted coins around the 2nd century BC. Coins bearing the inscription of the ethnicon ŒõŒëŒíŒôŒëŒ§ŒëŒù (LABIATAN) have been found in northern Albania. Illyrian light ships (lembus, pl. lembi) are often engraved on Labeatan coins, sometimes depicted with figureheads of serpents. Coin of Illyrian king Gentius, a Labeatan ruler. During his reign, the Illyrian king Gentius adopted economic measures which are well testified by archaeological finds. He developed a new system of coinage in the territory of his political entity. He allowed to mint coins to the cities of Skodra, Lissus, Rhizon and Lychnidus, allowing it also to the Labeatae and Daorsi, two of the most important Illyrian ethnics of the region at that time. This system considerably expanded the circulation of coins reaching even the deepest areas of the kingdom. Gentius centralized the production of the coins, interrupting the old minting of Skodra, and starting the production of new coins, which, instead of the engraving of Zeus, adopted the portrait of the king, while on the reverse continued bearing the typical engraving of the Illyrian ship (lembus), but the name of the king was engraved on them instead of the legend of the city. Thus Gentius had evidently removed monetary autonomy from the city of Skodra, and transformed the mint of Skodra's koinon into a royal mint. Gentius allowed other communities like Lissus, Labeatae and Daorsi to mint coins with the names of their koinon or ethnos, but nevertheless obliged them to respect the state standard, that was to engrave in the coins the portrait of the king and the Illyrian light ships. In addition, the coins of all these political entities had to respect the same size and weight as the coins produced in the royal mint of Skodra. Coins bearing the ethnicon of the Labeatae were minted also during the Roman period. These coins are mainly found on the mountainous area surrounding Skodra.

Naumov would describe him as \\"my number one pupil\\". During this time, he was tenured as a soloist by Moscow Philharmonia (the primary music organization of the USSR). After obtaining a doctorate, he was immediately engaged as assistant professor with Naumov at the Conservatory. At the age of 21 Viardo took the third prize and the Prix du Prince Rainier at the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition,*https://web.archive.org/web/20110725193742/http://www.concours- long-thibaud.org/fr-fr/laureats/recherche-des- laureats.html?v_piano=1&v;_annee=1971&v;_submit=1&v;_concours=piano and in 1973 first prize at the Van Cliburn International Competition. He had already launched an impressive world career when his travel visa was mysteriously revoked. For nearly thirteen years, Viardo was a virtual prisoner behind the Iron Curtain. During this period, he developed new horizons, vastly enlarging his repertoire, eventually including 37 concertos. Only when Mikhail Gorbachev rose to power in the Soviet Union the freedom to travel was restored, and in 1987 Viardo was permitted to accept engagements in Germany and in the United States. He joined the University of North Texas College of Music faculty as artist-in-residence in 1989.

Biography Chiang was born in Wuxi, a town near Shanghai in an aristocratic family of 12 children. At the age of 4, her family moved to Beijing, where she was raised in a 52-room mansion. Her Chinese name, Sun Yun, means \\"flower of the rue\\". As a child she enjoyed elaborate formal meals prepared by the family's two chefs, although the children were not allowed to cook or go into the kitchen. Her mother had bound feet, but her parents refused to follow the tradition with their children. She escaped with a sister from the Japanese occupation of China in 1942 by walking for nearly six months to Chongqing, where they settled with a relative. She soon met Chiang Liang (Ê±üÊ¢Å), a successful local businessman whom she married, establishing a comfortable life in Shanghai.http://www.saveur.com/article/Travels/Empress-of-San-Francisco There they had two children, May and Philip (Ê±ü‰∏ÄÂ∏Ü). During the war she operated as a spy for America's Office of Strategic Services. She and her husband escaped from China on the last flight from Shanghai during the Chinese Communist Revolution of 1949. With only three tickets for a family of four they had to leave Philip behind with her sister (the family was reunited more than a year later). Her parents and siblings who remained were treated poorly by the communists. Her parents died poor. A brother died in a labor camp and one sister committed suicide. Others were killed by communist soldiers. Chiang settled in Tokyo, Japan with her husband and children, May Ongbhaibulya and Philip Chiang. In 1960 she came to San Francisco to visit a sister, whose husband had died. Walking through the streets of San Francisco's Chinatown she met two friends from Tokyo who were planning to open a restaurant in a small space at 2209 Polk Street,http://www.sfgenealogy.com/san_francisco_directory/1962/1962_300.pdfhttp://www.sfgenealogy.com/san_francisco_directory/1962/1962_2825.pdfhttp://www.marinij.com/general- news/20070930/cecilia-chiang-chinas-julia-child and agreed to help negotiate their lease. She impulsively wrote a deposit check for $10,000 to secure their rent, which the landlord refused to return after her friends backed out of the venture. Unable to terminate the lease she decided to run the restaurant on her own, although she had never before run a business. At the time, non- Chinese Americans in the city had very limited exposure to authentic Northern Chinese cuisine, being familiar with only the Americanized version of Cantonese cuisine. Convinced that residents would enjoy Northern Chinese dishes, but unsure what would appeal to them, she initially listed more than 200 dishes on the menu. Avoiding the common elements of American Chinese restaurant decor, she designed the restaurant to evoke the opulence of the palace where she had grown up. The restaurant was at first unsuccessful and had few patrons.https://www.pbs.org/food/features/qa-cecilia-chiang-mandarin- restaurant/https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1611941 A Mandarin speaker, she had trouble communicating with suppliers from Chinatown, and also faced discrimination as a woman business owner. However, over time the restaurant began to attract loyal customers. Journalist C. Y. Lee, who had just written The Flower Drum Song, about San Francisco's Forbidden City Nightclub, became a regular and brought many friends. One day, Vic Bergeron (founder of Trader Vic's) came to the restaurant with Herb Caen, who immediately began to popularize the restaurant in his newspaper column. The restaurant was called the Mandarin. With the restaurant's new success, Chiang decided to remain in San Francisco. She separated from her husband (they never divorced) and brought her two children May and Philip, to live with her in Saint Francis Wood. She was the first non-white resident of the neighborhood, and was admitted by the homeowner association only after they learned that she was from an upper-class background in China. In 1968 she relocated the restaurant to a 300-seat location in Ghirardelli Square, which required a multimillion- dollar investment. Chiang was known for entertaining VIP guests in the dining room, wearing fancy gowns and expensive jewelry. Chiang sold the Mandarin in 1991, and it closed in 2006. After living for many years in San Francisco, she moved to Belvedere in Marin County, then back to San Francisco in 2011 where her daughter May and grandchild Alisa Ongbhaibulya live. Retired since 1991, Chiang remains active in promoting charitable causes, in particular the Chinese American International School. Her son Philip continued to run a sister restaurant also named the Mandarin, a high-end Beverly Hills institution established in 1974 and located on Camden Dr. In 2001 Philip sold the Mandarin, which permanently closed sometime after 2007. In 2013, Chiang won a James Beard Foundation Award for lifetime achievement.http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/across-the-nationacross-the- world/2013/san-francisco-social-diary-8 In 2014, filmmaker Wayne Wang's Soul of a Banquet documentary about Chiang's life was released. In July 2016, a six part cooking series The Kitchen Wisdom of Cecilia Chiang was released on PBS.http://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/jul/07/kitchen-wisdom-cecilia-chiang/ Influences Chiang is often credited with introducing San Francisco, and the United States, to a more authentic version of Mandarin cuisine. Chuck Williams of Williams Sonoma, who enjoyed the Mandarin's \\"beggar's chicken\\" dish (a whole stuffed chicken), introduced James Beard, who became a friend and learned about northern Chinese cuisine from Chiang. Alice Waters, who had just opened Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, learned Chinese cooking from Chiang, and the two became lifelong friends. Waters said that what Chiang did to popularize Chinese cuisine in America is what Julia Child (who Chiang also taught) did for French Cuisine. Waters, Chiang, and Marion Cunningham took a several-month tour of Europe in 1978 to sample as many of the best restaurants as they could. George Chen, a founder of the city's Betelenut and Shanghai 1930 (now closed, as are his other ventures, Long Life Noodle Co. and Xanadu), waited tables for Chiang at the Mandarin in the 1970s. Others who were influenced by Chiang include Jeremiah Tower, and the food editor of Sunset Magazine. In a panel hosted by Anthony Bourdain, in response to a question from an audience member, Alice Waters said that she wanted her last meal on earth to be shark fin soup cooked by Chiang. The comment became a viral sensation, eventually leading the Humane Society International to obtain a pledge from Waters that she would never again eat the dish. Chiang's son, Philip, is a co-founder of the restaurant chain P.F. Chang's.

(2 February 1745 ‚Äì 1 July 1813) was an English preacher and coalheaver.William Huntington, National Portrait Gallery, London, accessed September 2009 He is said to have preached that \\"moral law\\" is unnecessary, a theological view known as Antinomianism.The life and thought of John Gill (1697‚Äì1771): a tercentennial appreciation, John Gill, Michael A. G. Haykin Huntington was a strict Calvinist who believed some were predestined to be saved and some were not. He was also convinced that he would be identified as a true prophet on Judgment Day. His unusual, polemical style of preaching and writing made him popular but brought conflicts with other preachers throughout his life. He founded or opened chapels throughout England, many of which survive including Bethlehem Chapel Richmond upon Thames . Biography William Huntington was born in 1745 near Cranbrook in Kent, and was given the name William Hunt at his baptism there five years later. It is said that his father was Barnabus Russel ‚Äì his mother's husband's employer ‚Äì despite his mother's marriage to William Hunt. He was the tenth child of Elizabeth Hunt and the only male to achieve maturity.William Huntington S.S. or Parson Sack, By Ian R. K. Paisley, ianpaisley.org, accessed August 2015 He had an unsuccessful romance with Susannah Fever, from which a child was born. He left the Kent area and changed his name. Now William Huntington he was free from his financial obligation, but not his conscience. He changed his surname to Huntington in 1769, his rationale was that the \\"-ing\\" represented the present participle in words representing sinful activities, such as \\"stealing\\" and \\"swearing\\", and \\"ton\\" referred to his being \\"a vessel of the Lord\\". Later that year, he married Mary Short, a servant, they moved to Mortlake in Surrey and Huntington resumed his gardening work. Nevertheless, he was still very poor. He did attend a number of schools, but it was always as a result of charity. He said himself that he was frequently hungry.Life of the author, William Huntington, Williamhuntington.net, accessed October 2010 He was the son of a farmworker and he undertook work that was unskilled or semi-skilled, such as driving hearses and coaches, gardening and heaving coal. He also spent some time as a tramp. Huntington's portrait from his chapel in Lewes Providence Chapel in Chichester Jireh Chapel in Lewes In 1773, Huntington and his wife moved to Sunbury-on-Thames in Middlesex. Soon afterwards he reported that he had been contacted by Christ. The vision, which appeared as a bright light from which Christ's bloodied body emerged, told him that he was brought under the covenant love of God's elect. He became dissatisfied with his existing religious beliefs, and began to associate with Baptists, Methodists and Calvinists in various Surrey and Middlesex towns. He became known locally for his Biblical knowledge and preaching, and he established his first congregation at Thames Ditton in Surrey, where he was a Baptist. He then had an independent group in Woking, also in Surrey.Witness against the beast: William Blake and the moral law, E. P. Thompson, accessed September 2009 By the 1780s, Huntington preached at a large circuit of chapels across Surrey, Sussex and London: for example, he was involved in the early days of Bugby Chapel, a Calvinistic chapel founded in 1779 in Epsom, and of Five Ash Down Independent Chapel, founded in 1773 in East Sussex. His ongoing poverty, exacerbated by the loss of his coalheaving job, forced him to walk long distances every week. He controversially claimed that Divine Providence alleviated his poverty at this time by occasionally supplying money, food and a horse. In 1782, he received another message ‚Äì prophesy upon the thick boughs ‚Äì and moved to London, where he established a chapel on Titchfield Street. Providence Chapel was consecrated in 1783, and became very popular: hundreds or sometimes thousands of people attended his ministry, including Princess Amelia and members of the nobility‚Äîalthough Huntington himself preferred preaching to poorer people. His preaching style was evangelising, and he was known for preaching that the so-called moral law was the \\"ministration of condemnation\\" (2 Corinthians 3:9) rather than the rule of life for believers, for which he was accused of Antinomianism, among others by the Baptists John Rylands and Maria De Fleury.Emma Major, \\"Fleury, Maria de (fl. 1773‚Äì1791)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) Retrieved 29 July 2016. Huntington has been identified as the \\"most egregious\\" proponent of Antinomianism.John Cannon. antinomianism, The Oxford Companion to British History. Oxford University Press. 2002. Encyclopedia.com. 17 September 2009. Huntington's \\"Broken Cistern\\" gives his views about Antinomianism: > \\"I will not say that the authors of this book are Antinomians, but this I > will say, that the book contains the worst Antinomianism that I ever read, > and is a vile and damnable harangue, both against the law, the gospel, and > the grace of God. Against the law, because it declares, the law has ceased > to exist, and is done away, as a covenant of works. Against the gospel, > because it is no rule of right or wrong. And against the grace of God, by > declaring that the new man is taken captive by sin.\\" This quotation, from Huntington's sermon \\"Moses Unveiled in the Face of Christ\\", is another example of Huntington's views on Antinomianism. > \\"A real Antinomian, in the sight of God, is one who 'holds the truth in > unrighteousness', who has gospel notions in his head, but no grace in his > heart. He is one that makes a profession of Christ Jesus, but was never > purged by his blood, renewed by his Spirit, nor saved by his power.

And this is a real > Antinomian in the sight of God.‚Äù During his time in London, Huntington's reputation grew, and he opened chapels elsewhere. In 1805 he was invited to be the preacher at a new chapel in Lewes in Sussex. Jireh Chapel had been founded by Jenkin Jenkins, who had left his previous church in the town after a dispute with the congregation. Huntington, who had already added \\"S.S.\\" to his own name to indicate that he was a sinner who was saved, added \\"W.A.\\" to Jenkins' name, which he said stood for \\"Welsh Ambassador\\". Elsewhere, Huntington founded four chapels in the East Midlands in 1806, the Providence Chapel in Chichester‚Äîwhose interior was installed in 1809,Liturgical Space: Christian Worship and Church Buildings in Western Europe, Nigel Yates, accessed September 2009 and which is still extant as of 2009‚Äîand another chapel in Bristol the following year. Huntington and his wife lived in the Paddington area of London at first, but as their wealth grew they were able to move to a large villa in nearby Cricklewood. Mary, with whom Huntington had 13 children, died on 9 December 1806. Huntington then married the former Lady Elizabeth Sanderson (widow of Sir James Sanderson bt a former Lord Mayor of London). Lady Sanderson, who continued to use that name after marriage, died in 1817. In 1810, the Providence Chapel in Titchfield Street burnt down. Huntington, who by this time was wealthy, raised about ¬£10,000 to build a new, larger chapel. St Bartholomew's church, or the New Providence Chapel, held its first service on 20 June 1811.'The Calthorpe Estate', Survey of London: volume 24: The parish of St Pancras part 4: King‚Äôs Cross Neighbourhood (1952), pp. 56‚Äì69. url Date accessed: 17 September 2009 Huntington died in 1813, after which various preachers tried to take on St Bartholomew's. (The church was finally destroyed during the bombing of London in the Second World War.) Huntington was buried at the Jireh chapel in Lewes beside Jenkin Jenkins who had died in 1810. The inscription, which he composed only a few days before he died, reads \\"Here lies the coalheaver who departed his life July 1st 1813 in the 69th year of his age, beloved of his God but abhorred of men. The omniscient Judge at the grand assize shall ratify and confirm this to the confusion of many thousands, for England and its metropolis will know that there has been a prophet amongst them.\\"Seeing beyond the word: visual arts and the Calvinist tradition, Paul Corby Finney, p80, accessed September 2009 Writings Huntington was a prolific writer and publisher of religious tracts, polemics, sermons and other pieces.

The lake's shape vaguely resembles a rhombus. When dry, the flatness of the exposed lake bed sediments makes it a favoured location for recreational driving. It is also notorious for its dust storms (when dry), usually the result of monsoonal thunderstorms during the summer. During times of significant rain the lagoon can fill completely with water, leaving the unpaved road along its west bank as the only means of traversing the area. Flanked by the Sierra de Los Cucapah and the Sierra de Ju√°rez mountain ranges, the lake is approximately long and at its widest point. Tectonic activity The lake itself is located on the bottom of a shallow depression, a graben, which is linked to the San Andreas Fault, and the East Pacific Rise as part of the Laguna Salada Fault. This fault is connected to the Salton Trough fault which holds a similar depression, the Salton Sink. This sink is bigger than Laguna Salada and contains the Salton Sea.

Ford Motor Company (119 Cal.App.3d 757, 174 Cal.Rptr. 348) was a personal injury tort case decided in Orange County, California in February 1978 and affirmed by a California appellate court in May 1981. The lawsuit involved the safety of the design of the Ford Pinto automobile, manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. The jury awarded plaintiffs $127.8 million in damages, the largest ever in US product liability and personal injury cases. Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company was one of the most widely publicized of the more than a hundred lawsuits brought against Ford in connection with rear-end accidents in the Pinto.: Ford customers filed 117 lawsuits, according to Peter Wyden in The Unknown Iacocca. On appeal, Ford contested the trial court judgement on the basis of errors, and contested the punitive damages award on the grounds of an absence of malice and that the punitive damages award was not authorized by statute and was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the trial court.  Trial  A 1972 Pinto rear-end impact and fire in Orange County, California, resulted in the death of the driver Lily Gray and severe injury to passenger Richard Grimshaw. Gray's family and Grimshaw filed separate suits against Ford, but the actions were consolidated for trial. The jury awarded $127.8 million in damages; $125 million in punitive damages, and $2,841,000 in compensatory damages to Grimshaw and $665,000 in compensatory damages to the Gray family. The jury award was the largest ever in US product liability and personal injury cases. The jury award was the largest against an automaker until a $150 million verdict in a 1996 case, Hardy vs. General Motors. The judge reduced the jury's punitive damages award to $3.5 million, which he later said was \\"still larger than any other punitive damage award in the state by a factor of about five.\\"  Reaction  University of California Los Angeles law professor Gary T. Schwartz, writing in 1990, said that the jury verdict was plausible, and that the \\"core of the Pinto story\\" was: > Given this description of the Pinto's design problem, some comments can be > offered on the decision-making process within Ford that resulted in the > Pinto. As shown above, a famous Ford report cannot be interpreted as showing > Ford balancing lives against dollars in designing the Pinto. To state that > the report does not itself reveal such a process does not mean, however, > that such a process did not take place. Accordingly, I have consulted the > Grimshaw record to learn what light it sheds on this question. As far as > basic gas tank location is concerned, I am persuaded that the trunk capacity > problem, in conjunction with American auto custom, provides the best > explanation for Ford's choice to place the Pinto gas tank behind the axle. > As for additional design proposals brought forward by the plaintiffs, > several of them-for example, a bladder within the gas tank, and a \\"tank > within the tank\\"-concerned somewhat innovative technology that had never > been utilized in actual auto production. At trial, there was testimony that > a bladder would have been feasible in the early 1970's, but also rebuttal > testimony that a bladder was at this time beyond the bounds of feasibility. > The jury's general verdict does not reveal whether and how the jury resolved > such conflicts in the evidence; and I am in no position to resolve them > here. Consider now, however, the combination of a stronger bumper, a smooth > (bolt-free) differential, and the addition of both hat sections and > horizontal cross-members. This combination of design changes clearly would > have improved the Pinto's safety to some appreciable extent. According to > the evidence, the overall cost of this combination would have been $9; and > it makes sense to assume that these items were turned down by Ford in > planning the Pinto primarily on account of their monetary costs. It is > plausible to believe, then, that because of these costs, Ford decided not to > improve the Pinto's design, knowing that its decision would increase the > chances of the loss of consumer life. Once a variety of misconceptions are > stripped away, this limited core of the Pinto story remains. And this is a > core that may well be strong enough to support the \\"myth\\" of the Ford Pinto > case in the second of the meanings described above. What follows is my > effort to explicate the elements of that myth. According to the Los Angeles Times in 2010, the award \\"signalled to the auto industry that it would be harshly sanctioned for ignoring known defects.\\"  Appeal  In discussing the appellate court findings of fact Schwartz (1990) notes that the appellate court was under strict rules of interpretation. He states: > For reasons quite beyond the court's control, its opinion must be treated > cautiously as a source of actual facts. Because the defendant was appealing > a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the court was under an obligation > to view all the evidence in a way most favorable to the plaintiffs and > essentially to ignore evidence in the record that might be favorable to the > defendant. See id. at 773, 820, 174 Cal. Rptr. at 359, 388. In fact, Ford's > basic position at trial-which the court's opinion at no point mentions-was > that the approaching car (a Ford Galaxie) had not slowed down at all, and > had struck the Gray car at a speed in excess of 50 miles per hour. There was > an enormous amount of evidence at trial supporting each of the parties' > factual claims as to the Galaxie's closing speed. Had the jury accepted > Ford's speed estimate, there would not have been much of an issue of > crashworthiness: for the plaintiffs' position throughout trial was that even > a state-of-the-art fuel system could not maintain integrity in a 50 mile-per > hour collision.  Appellate court findings of fact  The trial court's findings of fact regarding the accident, the design of the Pinto, Ford's crash testing, and Ford's cost benefit analysis were not contested on appeal, and were accepted by the appellate court \\"in accordance with established principles of appellate review.\\": Since sufficiency of the evidence is in issue only regarding the punitive damage award, we make no attempt to review the evidence bearing on all of the litigated issues. Subject to amplification when we deal with specific issues, we shall set out the basic facts pertinent to these appeals in accordance with established principles of appellate review  The accident  A 1972 Ford Pinto hatchback stalled on a freeway, erupting into flames when it was rear-ended by a Ford Galaxie proceeding in the same direction. Lilly Gray, the driver of the Pinto, suffered severe burns to her entire body and resulted in her death by congestive heart failure. 13-year-old Richard Grimshaw, a passenger, suffered severe, permanently disfiguring burns to his entire body. Grimshaw underwent numerous skin grafts and extensive surgeries, but still lost portions of the fingers on his left hand and his left ear in the accident. Doctors estimated that Grimshaw would require many more surgeries within the next 10 years. The plaintiff's expert testified that the Pinto's gas tank was pushed forward upon impact and punctured by a flange or bolt on the differential housing. Fuel sprayed from the tank and entered the passenger compartment through the gaps between the rear wheel wells and the floor.  Design of the Pinto fuel system  In 1968, Ford began designing the subcompact car that would eventually become known as the Pinto. The courts found that Lee Iacocca, at the time a vice president at Ford, conceived the Pinto \\"project and was its moving force\\" and said that \\"Ford's objective was to build a car at or below 2,000 pounds to sell for no more than $2,000.\\": In 1968, Ford began designing a new subcompact automobile which ultimately became the Pinto. Mr. Iacocca, then a Ford vice president, conceived the project and was its moving force. Ford's objective was to build a car at or below 2,000 pounds to sell for no more than $2,000. The courts described the Pinto as a \\"rush project,\\" and said that while standard automotive industry practice was that \\"engineering studies precede the styling,\\" in the case of the Pinto project \\"styling preceded engineering and dictated engineering design to a greater degree than usual.\\": Ordinarily marketing surveys and preliminary engineering studies precede the styling of a new automobile line. Pinto, however, was a rush project, so that styling preceded engineering and dictated engineering design to a greater degree than usual. The court found that the Pinto's styling required the gas tank to be placed behind the rear axle, instead of over the rear axle as was \\"the preferred practice in Europe and Japan\\" and that the Pinto had \\"only 9 or 10 inches\\" of \\"crush space,\\" \\"far less than in any other American automobile or Ford overseas subcompact.\\": Among the engineering decisions dictated by styling was the placement of the fuel tank. It was then the preferred practice in Europe and Japan to locate the gas tank over the rear axle in subcompacts because a small vehicle has less \\"crush space\\" between the rear axle and the bumper than larger cars. The Pinto's styling, however, required the tank to be placed behind the rear axle leaving only 9 or 10 inches of \\"crush space\\"--far less than in any other American automobile or Ford overseas subcompact. The court found that the Pinto's bumper \\"was little more than a chrome strip, less substantial than the bumper of any other American car produced then or later.\\": In addition, the Pinto was designed so that its bumper was little more than a chrome strip, less substantial than the bumper of any other American car produced then or later. The court found that the Pinto's rear structure lacked reinforcement \\"found in all automobiles produced by Ford's overseas operations,\\" rendering the Pinto \\"less crush resistant than other vehicles.\\": Pinto's rear structure also lacked reinforcing members known as \\"hat sections\\" (two longitudinal side members) and horizontal cross-members running between them such as were found in cars of larger unitized construction and in all automobiles produced by Ford's overseas operations. The absence of the reinforcing members rendered the Pinto less crush resistant than other vehicles. The court found that a flange and a line of bolts on the Pinto's differential housing \\"were sufficient to puncture a gas tank driven forward upon rear impact.\\": Finally, the differential housing selected for the Pinto had an exposed flange and a line of exposed bolt heads. These protrusions were sufficient to puncture a gas tank driven forward against the differential upon rear impact.  Crash tests  Ford tested two production models of the Pinto and prototypes, some of which \\"were true duplicates of the design car,\\" \\"to determine, among other things, the integrity of the fuel system in rear-end accidents.\\": During the development of the Pinto, prototypes were built and tested. Some were \\"mechanical prototypes\\" which duplicated mechanical features of the design but not its appearance while others, referred [119 Cal. App. 3d 775] to as \\"engineering prototypes,\\" were true duplicates of the design car. These prototypes as well as two production Pintos were crash tested by Ford to determine, among other things, the integrity of the fuel system in rear-end accidents. Proposed federal regulations required impacts \\"without significant fuel spillage,\\" up to impacts by 1972 and by 1973.: Ford also conducted the tests to see if the Pinto as designed would meet a proposed federal regulation requiring all automobiles manufactured in 1972 to be able to withstand a 20-mile-per-hour fixed barrier impact without significant fuel spillage and all automobiles manufactured after January 1, 1973, to withstand a 30-mile-per-hour fixed barrier impact without significant fuel spillage. Crash tests proved that the Pinto could not meet the proposed regulations. A collision from the rear \\"caused the fuel tank to be driven forward and to be punctured, causing fuel leakage.\\" A collision of a production Pinto \\"caused the fuel neck to be torn from the gas tank and the tank to be punctured by a bolt head on the differential housing.\\" In at least one test collision \\"spilled fuel entered the driver's compartment through gaps resulting from the separation of the seams joining the rear wheel wells to the floor pan,\\" separations due in part to \\"the lack of reinforcement in the rear structure.\\": The crash tests revealed that the Pinto's fuel system as designed could not meet the 20-mile- per-hour proposed standard. Mechanical prototypes struck from the rear with a moving barrier at 21 miles per hour caused the fuel tank to be driven forward and to be punctured, causing fuel leakage in excess of the standard prescribed by the proposed regulation. A production Pinto crash tested at 21 miles per hour into a fixed barrier caused the fuel neck to be torn from the gas tank and the tank to be punctured by a bolt head on the differential housing. In at least one test, spilled fuel entered the driver's compartment through gaps resulting from the separation of the seams joining the rear wheel wells to the floor pan. The seam separation was occasioned by the lack of reinforcement in the rear structure and insufficient welds of the wheel wells to the floor pan. Ford tested modified Pinto prototypes, which \\"proved safe at speeds at which the Pinto failed,\\" including modifications to line the fuel tank with a rubber bladder, to locate the fuel tank above rather than behind the rear axle, and to add reinforcement.: Tests conducted by Ford on other vehicles, including modified or reinforced mechanical Pinto prototypes, proved safe at speeds at which the Pinto failed. Where rubber bladders had been installed in the tank, crash tests into fixed barriers at 21 miles per hour withstood leakage from punctures in the gas tank. Vehicles with fuel tanks installed above rather than behind the rear axle passed the fuel system integrity test at 31-miles- per-hour fixed barrier. A Pinto with two longitudinal hat sections added to firm up the rear structure passed a 20-mile-per-hour rear impact fixed barrier test with no fuel leakage.  The cost to remedy design deficiencies  The courts found that, while \\"the standard of care for engineers in the industry\\" after a failed safety test was to \\"redesign and retest,\\" and although fixes were inexpensive, \\"Ford produced and sold the Pinto to the public without doing anything to remedy the defects.\\": When a prototype failed the fuel system integrity test, the standard of care for engineers in the industry was to redesign and retest it. The vulnerability of the production Pinto's fuel tank at speeds of 20 and 30-miles-per-hour fixed barrier tests could have been remedied by inexpensive \\"fixes,\\" but Ford produced and sold the Pinto to the public without doing anything to remedy the defects. Design changes that would have enhanced the fuel system at very little cost included:: Design changes that would have enhanced the integrity of the fuel tank system at relatively little cost per car included the following: Longitudinal side members and cross members at $2.40 and $1.80, respectively; a single shock absorbent \\"flak suit\\" to protect the tank at $4; a tank within a tank and placement of the tank over the axle at $5.08 to $5.79; a nylon bladder within the tank at $5.25 to $8; placement of the tank over the axle surrounded with a protective barrier at a cost of $9.95 per car; substitution of a rear axle with a smooth differential housing at a cost of $2.10; imposition of a protective shield between the differential housing and the tank at $2.35; improvement and reenforcement of the bumper at $2.60; addition of eight inches of crush space a cost of $6.40. * Longitudinal side members: $2.40 ea. * Cross members: $1.80 ea. * Shock absorbing \\"flak suit\\" for the fuel tank: $4.00 * Tank within a tank and placement of the tank over the rear axle: $5.08 to $5.79 * Nylon bladder within the tank: $5.25 to $8.00 * Placement of the tank over the rear axle with a protective barrier: $9.95 * Substitution of rear axle with a smooth differential housing: $2.10 * Protective shield between differential housing and fuel tank: $2.35 * Improvement and reinforcement of rear bumper: $2.60 * Additional crush space: $6.40 > Equipping the car with a reinforced rear structure, smooth axle, improved > bumper and additional crush space at a total cost of $15.30 would have made > the fuel tank safe in a 34 to 38-mile-per-hour rear-end collision by a > vehicle the size of the Ford Galaxie.

Management knowledge  The Pinto project team held regular product review meetings chaired and attended by Ford vice presidents. The Pinto was approved by Ford's Product Planning Committee, which included Iacocca and other Ford vice presidents.: The feasibility study was conducted under the supervision of Mr. Robert Alexander, vice president of car engineering. Ford's Product Planning Committee, whose members included Mr. Iacocca, Mr. Robert Alexander, and Mr. Harold MacDonald, Ford's group vice president of car engineering, approved the Pinto's concept and made the decision to go forward with the project. During the course of the project, regular product review meetings were held which were chaired by Mr. MacDonald and attended by Mr. Alexander. At an April, 1971 product review meeting, a report prepared by Ford engineers entitled \\"Fuel System Integrity Program Financial Review\\" was distributed and discussed, which referred to the crash tests of Ford vehicles and estimated the financial impact of design changes to comply with the proposed federal fuel system integrity standards. The report recommended deferring fixes in order to accrue cost savings.:At an April 1971 product review meeting chaired by Mr. MacDonald, those present received and discussed a report (exhibit 125) prepared by Ford engineers pertaining to the financial impact of a proposed federal standard on fuel system integrity and the cost savings which would accrue from deferring even minimal \\"fixes.\\" The report refers to crash tests of the integrity of the fuel system of Ford vehicles and design changes needed to meet anticipated federal standards...Exhibit No. 125 was a report presented at a Ford production review meeting in April 1971, recommending action to be taken in anticipation of the promulgation of federal standards on fuel system integrity. The report recommended, inter alia, deferral from 1974 to 1976 of the adoption of \\"flak suits\\" or \\"bladders\\" in all Ford cars, including the Pinto, in order to realize a savings of $20.9 million. Harley Copp, a former Ford engineer and the executive in charge of the crash testing program, \\"testified that the highest level of Ford's management made the decision to go forward with the production of the Pinto, knowing that the gas tank was vulnerable to puncture and rupture at low rear impact speeds creating a significant risk of death or injury from fire and knowing that 'fixes' were feasible at nominal cost.\\"  Disposition of appeals  The appellate court affirmed the trial court.  Defendant's appeals  Ford contested the trial court judgement on the basis of errors, and contested the punitive damages award on the grounds of an absence of malice and that the punitive damages award was not authorized by statute and was unconstitutional. = Errors = The appellate court \\"concluded that Ford has failed to demonstrate that any errors or irregularities occurred during the trial which resulted in a miscarriage of justice requiring reversal.\\" Ford contended that the trial court erroneously admitted Ford's \\"Fuel System Integrity Program Financial Review\\" report as irrelevant and prejudicial. In the document, Ford engineers recommending deferring the installation of \\"flak suits\\" or \\"bladders,\\" available at a cost of $4 to $8 per car, in all Ford cars to 1976, which allowed the company to realize a savings of $20.9 million. The appellate court ruled that the report was highly relevant in that \\"A reasonable inference may be drawn from the evidence that despite management's knowledge that the Pinto's fuel system could be made safe at a cost of but $4 to $8 per car, it decided to defer corrective measures to save money and enhance profits.\\": A reasonable inference may be drawn from the evidence that despite management's knowledge that the Pinto's fuel system could be made safe at a cost of but $4 to $8 per car, it decided to defer corrective measures to save money and enhance profits. The evidence was thus highly relevant and properly received. = Punitive damages = Ford contended the punitive damages on two grounds: 1) punitive damages are statutorily and constitutionally impermissible in design defect cases; and 2) there was no evidentiary support for a finding of malice or corporate responsibility for malice. ;Punitive damages in design defect cases The appellate court found no statutory impediments to punitive damages and said that \\"Ford's contention that the statute is unconstitutional has been repeatedly rejected.\\" ;Malice Ford contended that the \\"Exemplary damages\\" section of California's civil code required an \\"evil motive,\\" or an intent to injure the person harmed, for punitive damages, and argued absence of malice. The appellate court cited precedent that \\"malice\\" as used in California's \\"Exemplary damages\\" code included \\"not only a malicious intention to injure the specific person harmed, but conduct evincing 'a conscious disregard of the probability that the actor's conduct will result in injury to others.'\\": As this court recently noted, numerous California cases after Davis v. Hearst, supra, have interpreted the term \\"malice\\" as used in section 3294 to include, not only a malicious intention to injure the specific person harmed, but conduct evincing \\"a conscious disregard of the probability that the actor's conduct will result in injury to others.\\" In Taylor v. Superior Court, the California Superior Court held that a conscious disregard of the safety of others is sufficient to meet the animus malus required for punitive damages awards, adding: \\"In order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he wilfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\\" In a commercial context, the imposition of punitive damages deters the furtherance of \\"objectional corporate policies\\" and encourages the remedy of safety concerns that might otherwise go unchecked.598 P.2d 854: In Taylor v. Superior Court, supra, 24 Cal. 3d 890, our high court's most recent pronouncement on the subject of punitive damages, the court observed that the availability of punitive damages has not been limited to cases in which there is an actual intent to harm plaintiff or others. (Id, at p. 895.) The court concurred with the Searle (G.D. Searle & Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 49 Cal.App.3d 22) court's suggestion that conscious disregard of the safety of others is an appropriate description of the animus malus required by Civil Code section 3294, adding: \\"In order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he wilfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\\" According to the appellate court decision, > There was ample evidence to support a finding of malice and Ford's > responsibility for malice. Through the results of the crash tests Ford knew > that the Pinto's fuel tank and rear structure would expose consumers to > serious injury or death in a 20- to 30-mile-per-hour collision. There was > evidence that Ford could have corrected the hazardous design defects at > minimal cost but decided to defer correction of the shortcomings by engaging > in a cost-benefit analysis balancing human lives and limbs against corporate > profits. Ford's institutional mentality was shown to be one of callous > indifference to public safety. There was substantial evidence that Ford's > conduct constituted \\"conscious disregard\\" of the probability of injury to > members of the consuming public...There is substantial evidence that > management was aware of the crash tests showing the vulnerability of the > Pinto's fuel tank to rupture at low speed rear impacts with consequent > significant risk of injury or death of the occupants by fire. There was > testimony from several sources that the test results were forwarded up the > chain of command;...While much of the evidence was necessarily > circumstantial, there was substantial evidence from which the jury could > reasonably find that Ford's management decided to proceed with the > production of the Pinto with knowledge of test results revealing design > defects which rendered the fuel tank extremely vulnerable on rear impact at > low speeds and endangered the safety and lives of the occupants. Such > conduct constitutes corporate malice. Ford argued that the amount awarded in punitive damages was excessive. The test for deciding whether the amount was excessive as a matter of law or was so grossly disproportionate as to raise the presumption that it was the product of passion or prejudice is four-prong: 1) the degree of reprehensibility of defendant's conduct; 2) wealth of the defendant; 3) the amount of compensatory damages; and 4) an amount which would serve as a deterrent effect on like conduct by the defendant and others. The appellate court held that > ...the conduct of Ford's management was reprehensible in the extreme. It > exhibited a conscious and callous disregard of public safety in order to > maximize corporate profits...Ford's tortious conduct endangered the lives of > thousands of Pinto purchasers. Weighed against the factor of > reprehensibility, the punitive damage award as reduced by the trial judge > was not excessive.\\" In light of Ford's 7.7 billion dollar net worth and 983 million dollar income after taxes in 1976, the court found that the punitive award was approximately 0.005% of Ford's net worth and 0.03% of its income. The ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages was approximately 1.4:1. Significantly, Ford did not argue about the excessiveness of the compensatory damages. Lastly, the punitive award was sufficient to require Ford to take notice, rather than allowing the company to write it off as a mere business expense.  Plaintiff's appeals  Grimshaw appeals from the order granting a conditional new trial and from the amended judgment entered pursuant to the order. Grimshaw argues that 1) the punitive damages awarded by the jury where not excessive as a matter of law; 2) the specification of reasons was inadequate; and 3) the court abused its discretion in cutting the award so drastically. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in reducing the jury's award of punitive damages from more than 122 million to 3.5 million or in granting a new trial for excessive damages. There was no evidence showing that the trial judge abused his discretion, nor that he acted in any way that was not fair and reasonable under the circumstances.  See also  * Mcgee v.

In this prolonged struggle, Croatia was a stronghold of the Anjou-Durazzo party fighting against king Sigismund. Prelude After the disastrous Battle of Nicopolis, King Sigismund called for the Sabor in city of Kri≈æevci and issued a written guarantee (saluus conductus) stating he would not attempt personal revenge on the opponents or harm them in any way. But, he organised the killing of the Croatian Ban Stephen Lackfi and his followers for supporting the opponent king candidate Ladislaus of Naples. The Croatian law dictated that no one could enter the Sabor with arms, so Ban Lackfi and his supporters left their arms in front of the church. Lackfi's supporting troops also remained outside the town. The king's supporters, on the other hand, were already in the church, fully armed. In the turbulent debate that followed, the king's supporters accused Lackfi for treason in the Battle of Nicopolis. Harsh words were used, fight started, and the king's vassals pulled their swords in front of the king, gutted Ban Lackfi, his nephew Stephen III Lackfi, who formerly served as Master of the horse, and the supporting nobility. Aftermath On the news of the Ban's death, the Croatian army rushed to Kri≈æevci and the battle with Sigismund supporters. In an unequal struggle thirty Croats fell, before they retreated. Enraged Croatian nobility, led by Stjepan Prodaviƒá, once again tried to take revenge for Lackfi's murder on the king, but they were suppressed, and Sigismund used the opportunity with his subjects on March 2 crossed Drava river and fled to Hungary. Two days later he issued in ≈Ωakanj the famous charter by which city ƒåakovec (Cs√°ktornya), Meƒëimurje and other estates of Stephen Lackfi were donated to his loyal subjects, among the first Hermann II, Count of Celje. Bloody Sabor resulted in Sigismund's fear of the revenge of Lackfi's men, new rebellions of the nobles in Croatia and Bosnia, the death of 170 Bosnian nobles who were killed by Sigismund, and selling off Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 ducats by Ladislaus of Naples. Finally, after 25 years of fighting, Sigismund succeeded in seizing power and was recognized as a king.

In a trial reported to have received \\"unprecedented public interest\\", Raymond Leslie Morris of Walsall was convicted at the Stafford Assizes of the murder of Christine Ann Darby after one of the largest manhunts in British history. Morris is also considered the chief suspect in the deaths of Margaret Reynolds and Diana Joy Tift. In November 2010, he was granted a judicial review of his case in a bid to overturn his conviction, which failed. Morris died in prison in March 2014, aged 84, after serving 45 years, by which time he was one of Britain's longest-serving prisoners. Raymond Leslie Morris Raymond Leslie Morris was born on 13 August 1929 in Walsall, Staffordshire (now part of the county of West Midlands). He lived in Walsall his entire life and was reported to have an IQ of 120. Morris went through a variety of jobs before getting a position as a foreman engineer at a precision instruments factory in Oldbury, West Midlands, in 1967. In 1951, he married 'the girl next door\\", who was two years younger than him, and fathered two boys. He kicked her out of the house after eight years of marriage, then divorced her on the grounds of adultery when she had another man's child. Morris's first wife would later describe him as a man with a need to express violent sexual dominance. At the age of 35, Morris was married again, this time to a 21-year-old woman named Carol. He had been suspected of taking indecent photographs of schoolgirls in October 1966, though he was not arrested as police failed to find any evidence. At the time the A34 murders were committed, Morris and his wife lived at Flat 20, Regent House, Green Lane, Walsall ‚Äì a council-owned flat in Birchills, directly opposite the police station. Murders On 1 December 1964, 9-year-old Julia Taylor was lured into a car in Bloxwich by a man claiming to be a friend of her mother. The girl was sexually assaulted, strangled and left for dead, and was only saved from exposure after she was spotted by a passing cyclist. On 12 January 1966, the bodies of Margaret Reynolds, age 6, and Diana Joy Tift, age 5, were found together in a ditch at Mansty Gully on Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. Reynolds went missing on her way to school in Aston, Birmingham, on 8 September 1965, and Tift went missing on a short walk to her grandmother's house in Bloxwich on 30 December that year. Two thousand people searched for Reynolds in the hours following her disappearance. On 22 August 1967, a soldier who was a member of a search party found the sprawled, naked body of seven-year-old Christine Darby beneath brushwood only a mile away from where Reynolds and Tift were discovered. Christine had been enticed into a car by a strange man near her home in Camden Street, Caldmore, Walsall, three days earlier. Witnesses in Walsall explained that they saw a man in a grey car who spoke in a local accent, while two others who had been on Cannock Chase remembered seeing a grey Austin A55 or A60.A well known local story in Walsall is that the man in the grey Austin car had asked a group of children playing in the street, of whom Christine Darby was one, for directions to Caldmore. In Walsall the pronunciation of the district of Caldmore is 'Karma' ‚Äì which Morris had used and the remaining children all told to the police during the investigation into Christine's disappearance. As a result the police knew they were hunting a Walsall man, as opposed to someone who might have pronounced it \\"Kald-moor\\" as a stranger to the area would read it from a roadmap. This led them to concentrate their hunt in and around Walsall ‚Äì a large industrial town which bordered Birmingham and West Bromwich, and still a very highly populated area. This theory was eventually to prove to be correct. Investigation The three murders were similar in that each victim was determined to have been coaxed into a car while near her home, then murdered after being sexually assaulted. Darby, Reynolds, and Tift lived within a seventeen-mile radius of each other and near the A34 road that passes through Cannock Chase. Furthermore, a 10-year-old girl named Jane Taylor had been abducted while riding her bicycle in the village of Mobberley in August 1966, and investigators could not disprove her disappearance was linked to what were colloquially known as the \\"A34 murders\\". The murders were collectively known as the \\"A34 murders\\" or \\"Cannock Chase murders\\". The murders sparked one of the biggest murder investigations in British criminal history. The manhunt was larger than that of the infamous Moors murders. Prior to making an arrest, 150 detectives visited 39,000 homes, interviewed 80,000 people and checked over a million car forms. Culling 25,000 vehicles from 1,375,000 files, investigators checked every Austin A55 and A60 in the Midlands. The hunt for the Cannock Chase murderer was led by Sir Stanley Bailey, Staffordshire‚Äôs Assistant Chief Constable at the time. A facial composite was used for the first time in British criminal history, and though no one came forward to identify anyone on the basis of the drawing, when police eventually arrested Morris they were struck by his resemblance to the picture. Breakthrough and arrest On 4 November 1968, at Bridgeman Street at the junction with Queen Street, Walsall, a 10-year-old escaped from a man who attempted to force her into his green and white Ford Corsair. This incident was witnessed by an 18-year-old woman who made a mental note of the vehicle registration plate. The police were called, who in turn called out the local vehicle registrations officer for Walsall. The woman had mixed up two of the numbers from the registration she had remembered. The police played around with the numbers and located a local record for a green and white Ford Corsair which was registered to Morris. Morris was arrested in connection with the attempted abduction. The police were aware that Morris, who had been interviewed four times in four years, had owned a grey Austin A55 similar to the one used in the abduction of Darby. He had been considered a suspect in Darby's death, but his wife provided him with an alibi by stating that the couple were shopping together the day she went missing. A police search of the Morris flat uncovered pornographic photographs of a young girl who was later determined to be Carol Morris's five-year-old niece. Scotland Yard detectives arrested Raymond Morris for Darby's murder on 16 November 1968. Two charges of indecent assault on the niece and one for the attempted abduction of Aulton would also be filed against Morris. Trial and conviction Carol Morris would eventually become the chief witness for the prosecution and retract what she had initially told investigators about shopping on the day of Darby's murder. During the trial, at the Stafford Assizes, Inspector Pat Molloy reported that when charged with murder Morris had said \\"Oh God. Was it the wife?\\"; Morris denied making such a statement, and alleged that he had been beaten in police interrogations. On 18 February 1969, Raymond Leslie Morris was found guilty of the rape and murder of seven- year-old Christine Darby, with the jury deliberating for less than two hours before reaching their verdict. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. (During the trial, a now teenage Julia Taylor was removed from the public gallery after crying out \\"That's him. That's the man that did it to me.\\") Although convicted only of murdering Christine Darby, Morris is considered the chief suspect in the deaths of both Reynolds and Tift, despite a lack of sufficient evidence for him to be charged with either murder. Reynolds's relatives consider Morris to be her killer. After the trial, it was discovered that his brother had entered Cannock police station stating that he believed Morris to be capable of abducting the two girls, whose bodies had yet to be found. However, as he had no evidence his statement had been marked 'No Further Action' and due to a filing error this incident was not discovered until after the trial.  Judicial review  In November 2010, Morris was granted a judicial review of the refusal of the Criminal Cases Review Commission to refer his case to the Court of Appeal, in a bid to overturn his conviction. A statement from Morris's defence team said: > The application for a judicial review is the first stage in his attempts to > have the matter referred back to the Court of Appeal after 42 years in > prison. If Morris's conviction was overturned it would be the longest > running miscarriage of justice in British history. It might also potentially > mean that a child murderer had remained at large for more than 40 years > during Morris's incarceration. However, Mr Justice Simon rejected the judicial reviewhttp://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/117.html and Morris later indicated that he had abandoned any further appeal. Death Raymond Leslie Morris died at HMP Preston health facility of natural causes on 11 March 2014. He was aged 84 at the time of his death, and had spent the final 45 years of his life in prison. He was reportedly issued with a whole life tariff by a Home Secretary or High Court judge at some stage, although this was never confirmed by the Home Office. By the time of his death, he was one of the oldest and longest-serving prisoners in England and Wales. In the media Morris has been dubbed the Cannock Chase murderer. A 1971 book compared and analysed various English newspapers' handling of the widely reported discovery of Reynolds's and Tift's remains. Morris was featured in a 1995 report in Central Independent Television's crime magazine series Crime Stalker and a 2004 documentary of the Cannock Chase murders was televised on the ITV series To Catch A Killer. Morris and the Cannock Chase murders are referred to in David Peace's novel Nineteen Seventy-Four and the Channel 4 adaptation, Red Riding. Further reading * Hawkes, Harry (1971). Murder on the A34.

Though never hugely popular, they enjoy a devoted following and are still produced today. Their unusual frame is described as pure cross, was marketed as cantilever, and features a distinctive hammock-style saddle. Variations include lightweight racing, tandem, and folding designs. Other Pedersen innovations include two and three- speed internally geared rear hubs.  History  Pedersen received a patent in the United Kingdom for his bicycle in the early 1890s and constructed the first model out of wood. He formed the Pedersen Cycle Frame Co. Ltd and when that fell into financial difficulties, production was continued by the Dursley Pedersen Cycle Co. The design was also licensed to other manufacturers, and approximately 30,000 units were produced by the early 1920s, but the design never really caught on. In 1978, Jesper S√∏lling resumed production in Copenhagen and has been followed by others.  Technology  Pedersen wrote that he developed the hammock style seat first. It provides suspension from road imperfections with much less weight, instead of of traditional leather and steel spring saddles of the day. Pedersen then developed a frame, a truss assembled from several thin tubes, around his new seat design. He attributed his inspiration to the Whipple-Murphy bridge truss. The design initially did not support seat height adjustment, and even after some adjustability was added, required the manufacture of eight different sizes. The non-standard frame design would not accommodate a traditional front fork. Instead, Pedersen developed a fork that also consisted of thin tubes assembled into a truss, which was attached to the frame with bearings at two distinct points, instead of through a traditional head tube. Pedersen also received patents for a chainwheel and bottom bracket combination and lightweight pedals.  Gallery  File:Pedersen-Rad.jpg|Modern Pedersen bicycle.

Authorship The work is an extract from the work The Life of Abraham. The earliest Syriac manuscript to contain it (fifth or sixth century) leaves the authorship anonymous. The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot is later attributed to Ephraem, deacon of Edessa and was likely written towards the end of his life,Hellen Waddell, Introduction to the Life of St. Mary the Harlot, in The Desert Fathers (London: Constable and Company, Ltd., 1936), 285-287 though there have been claims against Ephrem's authorship. Certain parallels have been noticed between Ephraem and Abraham, the uncle of St. Mary, notably that both were hermits who gave up their hermitage for work in the world only to return just before their deaths. The character of Abraham may be a semi-autobiographical representation of Ephraem, or Ephraem was motivated by their personal similarities to record the story. Ephraem writes that he is recounting the story in response to the unanimous request of his brethren, though this practice of claiming that one has been compelled to write is a common convention among ascetic authors as an expression of humility. The translator of the text from Syriac into Greek and Latin is unknown. Plot synopsis Chapter 1 The prologue, in which the author recounts this story to serve as a lesson in \\"compunction and humility\\" for those in their old age. Chapter 2 Abraham the hermit had a brother who died, leaving behind a seven-year-old daughter. The orphan, Mary, was brought by her father's friends to live with Abraham. He housed her in the outer room of the cell, while he lived in the inner room. Through a small window between the two rooms, Abraham taught her the psalter and the ascetic disciplines. Mary became great in spiritual virtue until she was an ascetic in her own right. Mary's father had left her a large sum of money. Abraham, not wishing that she should be ensnared by the affairs of the world, represented by her inheritance, had the money given to the poor. She lived with him for twenty years. Chapter 3 A monk, who is called \\"a monk in profession only,\\"The Life of St. Mary the Harlot, in The Desert Fathers, 290. came to visit Abraham, as was his habit. When he saw Mary, he lusted after her. He whispered things to her through the window, trying to tempt her. Finally, after a year had passed she came out to him, and they had sex. Mary regretted the act immediately. She enters into a soliloquy about her sin, at one point making a veiled allusion to the supposed author by name, wishing she had been true to his writings. Finally, she concluded, \\"I am a sinner full of sordid uncleanness - how shall I even try to speak with my holy uncle? If I even dared to attempt it, wouldn't a blast of fire burst from him to burn me to ashes?\\" She therefore left her uncle for a foreign land. Chapter 4 Abraham did not notice that Mary had gone. Instead, the truth of what had happened was revealed to him in a series of two dreams. In the first dream, an enormous dragon approached his cell. Finding a dove there, the dragon swallowed it whole. Abraham interpreted this dream to mean that some great heresy would befall the church, and he beseeched God to prevent it. Two days later, he had a second dream in which the dragon returned with his gut split open. Abraham could see that the dove was still alive in the beast's stomach, so he reached in and pulled it out. Only then did he understand that the dreams were about Mary's plight, with the dragon representing the devil, the dove representing Mary, and the two days between the dreams represents the two years that Abraham waited before pursuing his niece. Chapter 5 After two years, Abraham discovered Mary's location and sent a friend to give him a report on what she was doing. When he discovered the shameful life she was leading, he disguised himself as a soldier with a borrowed horse and uniform, and rode out to find her. The author breaks the narrative to draw an analogy between the patriarch Abraham who rode out to do war with kings in order to save Lot and the hermit Abraham who rode out to do war with Satan in order to save Mary. Chapter 6 Abraham arrived at the inn where Mary worked where he convinced the innkeeper to send Mary to him under the guise of an old soldier looking for companionship. Mary appeared, dressed as a prostitute, and does not recognize Abraham. Abraham has to restrain his tears so she does not recognize him and flee. Chapters 7‚Äì8 Mary proceeded to try and seduce Abraham, but when she smelled \\"the familiar scent of an abstinent body\\" she became very agitated. Abraham and the innkeeper both work to calm her down, until finally she sat and enjoyed supper with him. When they had eaten, Mary once again began to entice the monk, and Abraham consented to go up to Mary's room with her. The author pauses the narrative to praise God at length for the strength of the monk in breaking his ascetic ways in order to save Mary. Chapters 9-10 Once they were alone and the door had been locked, Abraham revealed himself to her. Mary sat petrified through the night as Abraham wept, prayed, and pleaded with her to return with him. Finally, he convinced her to leave, and she returned with him doing penance the whole way. When they returned to Abraham's house, Mary lived in the inner room, while Abraham occupied the outer room. Mary spent her days weeping and praying for forgiveness and salvation. People begin to be drawn to Mary because of her religious zeal. Chapters 11-14 The remainder of the narrative gives an account of the final years of both Abraham and Mary, with eulogies of both. Abraham lived ten years after they returned, and Mary five years longer than he. Of Abraham, it was said that he remained constant in all virtue and \\"lived each day as if it was his last.\\" Mary became famous not only for her piety but particularly for her mourning. Chapters 15-16 The author concludes the story by drawing an unfavorable comparison between himself and Abraham and Mary, disliking his own lack of total faith toward God. He begins by declaring \\"O what a wretch am I\\" and concludes \\"I mourn for the days of my negligence, for I have not any excuse to offer.\\" St. Ephraem's Prayer At the end of the hagiography is appended a prayer of St. Ephraem, which has theological implications in its fourth-century context: > Have mercy upon me, Thou that alone are without sin, and save me, who alone > art pitiful and kind: for beside Thee, the Father most blessed, and Thine > only begotten Son who was made flesh for us, and the Holy Ghost who giveth > life to all things, I know no other, and believe in no other. And now be > mindful of me, Lover of men, and lead me out of the prison-house of my sins, > for both are in Thy hand, O Lord, the time that Thou shalt bid me go out > from it elsewhere. Remember me that am without defence, and save me a > sinner: and may Thy grace, that was in this world my aid, my refuge, and my > glory, gather me under its wings in that great and terrible day. For Thou > knowest, Thou who dost try the hearts and reins, that I did shun much of > evil and the byways of same, the vanity of the impertinent and the defence > of heresy. And this not of myself, but of Thy grace wherewith my mind was > lit. Wherefore, holy Lord, I beseech Thee, bring me into Thy kingdom, and > deign to bless me with all that have found grace before Thee, for with Thee > is magnificence, adoration, and honour, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.The Life > of St. Mary the Harlot, in The Desert Fathers, 302. Much of the content of the prayer appears to be targeted at the Arian heresy, against which Ephraem was a combatant.

Towards the end of their lives in October 1685 they came to dominate state affairs in Golkonda. This is remarkable because they were administrators and ruled it and a large part of the elite of the sultanate were Muslims.  Early life  The brothers were born in Hanamkonda into a Niyogi Telugu Brahmin family of four brothers and some sisters, among whom, according to a Dutch contemporary source, Akkanna was his mother's favourite. Madanna was, however, the more talented. There has been some discussion in the historical literature about the question whether they were Telugu or Maratha Brahmins. It is probable that they were Smarta Brahmins, who honoured both Shiva or Vishnu, along with Surya.Gijs Kruijtzer, Xenophobia in Seventeenth-Century India (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2009), 226-30. They were Niyogis and also uncles of Bhakta Ramdas. Akkanna's descendants were called Akkarajus and Madanna's descendanants were Madarajus. Originally they had the surname of Pingili. Life Madanna started as a clerk with the Golconda Sultanate and moved higher up through talent, guile and intrigue. At some point Madanna and Akkanna came into the service of Sayyid Muzaffar, a nobleman of Persian descent. Some time after Sayyid Muzaffar had brought Abul Hasan (r. 1672-1687) to the throne, however, then vizier Madanna and brother locked him up in his house and took over the charge of the treasury.S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar, \\"Abul Hasan Qutub Shah and his Ministers, Madanna and Akkanna.\\" Journal of Indian History (August 1931): 91-142. As treasurer, Madanna became more and more powerful until he practically ruled the sultanate in all but name till his death, assisted by his brother Akkanna and his nephew Rustam Rao. Akkanna was less important, but was appointed general of the army, not so much to conduct military operations, but more to keep it from waging war (at least according to Dutch contemporary sources).Gijs Kruijtzer,Xenophobia in Seventeenth-Century India (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2009), 237-9 Administration The most important policies of Madanna were staving off the Mughal emperor and reforming the tax or revenue collection. After the alliance with Shivaji and certain parties in the Bijapur sultanate failed in 1677, the method employed by Madanna to stave off Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who was intent on subduing the Deccan sultanates, was to pay him off. In modern terms we would call this policy 'appeasement'. In order to be able to pay the enormous tributes to the Mughal emperor, Madanna reformed the revenue system. Briefly, he made sure that as little money as possible was left with the intermediaries in the collection chain and that the revenue collected from the agriculturalists, artisans and traders came directly to the state.Gijs Kruijtzer,Xenophobia in Seventeenth- Century India (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2009), 230-42 Death The brothers were beheaded by a mob as they came out of their palace one night. It was sent to Prince Shah Alam (Muazzam) by a discreet person, on the day the Mughal army reached Hyderabad in October 1685. Their murder is surrounded by much intrigue and mystery, but according to Mughal historian Khafi Khan they were seen by the Mughals as the cause of the troubles the Sultanate of Golkonda was creating for them.Khafi Khan, Muntakhab ul-Lubab (Persian text), 308 Less than two years after their death, the sultanate finally fell to the Mughals. Already in the eighteenth century, their rule was remembered as a golden age by the people who drew up the local histories found in the Mackenzie collection.Gijs Kruijtzer,Xenophobia in Seventeenth-Century India (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2009), 248-9 The brothers are remembered in today's Telangana as administrators and as martyrs.K.V.

The house remained in his family for many years. His son George lived there until 1933 when he lost the structure due to bankruptcy. For several years, the building stood vacant but, in 1941, E. M.

The parish is part of the Diocese of the Highveld, which is in turn part of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa (previously known as The Church of the Province of Southern Africa).  Foundation and establishment  The Anglican Parish of Germiston was formally founded in 1897. Prior to the parish being formally established, it was a mission chapelry of the parish of Boksburg, which had been established in 1890. Baptismal, confirmation and marriage records show that mission work existed prior to 1890, going back to the founding of Germiston in 1886. At that time the work of the mission priests fell under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Pretoria. Originally the parish consisted solely of the Parish Church of St Boniface in what is now the inner city of Germiston. The present church building is the second on the site, designed in 1908 and then built in 1910, both by Sir Herbert Baker. The original church was a tin building with a concrete and stone foundation, very similar in style to the miners' dwellings of the late 19th century and early 20th century period, as was found on the East Rand and the Witwatersrand in general. The building of 1910 is typical of the Baker style so prevalent in South Africa and the British Empire at the turn of the 20th century. There are to be found many similarities with St George's Cathedral in Cape Town, built in 1901, the exterior of St Mary's Cathedral in Johannesburg, built in 1927, and the exterior of St George's Church in Parktown built in 1904. St Michael's Church in Boksburg, built in 1911, has Baker features too, but most of the design and the build were carried out by his architectural business partner, Frank Fleming. The parish was originally part of the Diocese of Pretoria, but then became part of the Diocese of Johannesburg when it was founded in 1922. In 1990, when the need arose to split the large diocese of Johannesburg into smaller dioceses, to thus be better administered, the parish of Germiston became part of the Diocese of the Highveld.  The building  St Boniface is one of the larger parish churches built by Baker, and indeed one of the few large church buildings designed by him to have been completed as to his original plans. It has seating capacity for about four hundred people, including the nave, side chapels and chancel. The church, which is of a stone structure throughout, has typical Norman or Romanesque features, as found in many of Baker's buildings, including some of the most beautiful stained glass windows of the early 20th century. Apart from the gallery, nave, chancel and sanctuary, the church also has a small Lady Chapel with seating for sixteen congregants and an All Souls Chapel which is a war memorial to the dead of the First World War and was dedicated as the War Memorial Shrine in August 1918, even before the war had ended. Subsequently, after the various wars that were to follow, involving South African troops, and especially those who were parishioners, the shrine became the chapel seen today, as a memorial to all subsequent conflicts involving the armed forces. There is also a crypt chapel underneath the chancel and sanctuary, which is alongside the columbarium which was specifically designed for the interment of ashes, and was consecrated for that use by the Rt Revd Timothy Bavin, the then Bishop of Johannesburg in 1977. The historic two manual Norman and Beard pipe organ, built in 1910, is situated in an organ loft to the right of the chancel as one looks at the high altar. It was designed especially for the church by the company in England and shipped out for the opening of the Baker building. It is considered one of the best English Romantic organs in South Africa, albeit a humble instrument in relation to its cathedral counterparts. Apart from the beautiful architecture and stained glass windows, the church houses some beautiful art works by the famous South African artist and sculptor, Cecil Skotnes. The icon of the Mother and child above the altar in the Lady Chapel is particularly noteworthy.  Worship  The parish is well-known locally for its good liturgy, within the high church tradition and has maintained an active choral tradition since it was founded. At one time, in 1975, it boasted a choir of thirty-two boys and twelve men, not to mention twelve ladies. These days the choir continues to maintain this tradition and the high standards of the past. The parish is affiliated to the Royal School of Church Music, and the choir members regularly attend workshops and choir schools run by the local northern branch of the RSCM.  Rectors and clergy  The parish's rector is Mtr Marlene Rodda; Fr John Rodda, her husband, who is also a professor of Paediatric Neurology at the University of the Witwatersrand and Baragwanath Hospital is a non-stipendary assistant priest. Before the Rodda's incumbency, Fr Don Thomson served as rector from 1997 to 2010. In December 2010, Fr Malcolm Chalmers, who had been Director of Music in the Parish since February 1997, was appointed as an additional self-supporting clergyman. He is also Headmaster of the Preparatory School of the historic St. Martin's School in Johannesburg. Past well-known rectors of the parish have included Gonville ffrench-Beytagh, who later became Dean of Johannesburg and was subsequently deported by the apartheid government in 1972, Robin Roy Snyman who became Dean of Kimberley and later vice-provost of Port Elizabeth and David Beetge (bishop) who became the first bishop of The Highveld.  Centenary  2010 saw the commemoration of the centenary of the Sir Herbert Baker building. Special events took place, most especially a thanksgiving service on Sunday 8 August, with choir, brass and organ, where the bishop, David Bannerman, delivered the homily. The celebrations concluded with a recital on the one-hundred-year-old organ and the usual Christmas music programmes.  Parish 120th Celebrations  2017 marked the 120th anniversary of the founding of the Anglican Parish of Germiston, with St Boniface as the mother church of the parish. The parish includes the former chapelry, now church, of St Mary and St John and the chapelry of St Mark in Rosedeep. A special celebratory service was held on Saturday, 18 November 2017. The guest preacher was the diocesan bishop, Charles May .

It is a large area leading to a descent from which four finger-like ridges point eastward. On these ridges more tombs are located. The current estimate of tombs in the cemetery is over 1100. The largest section, that on the plateau proper, has two east-west paths which divide it into three parts. There are also two small cemeteries near Qumran, one ten minutes' walk north of the main cemetery and one to the south, on the other side of Wadi Qumran. Excavation The cemetery at the Qumran site is said to be a unique cemetery because how all of the graves differ from each other in one way or another. The characteristics of some graves point towards one tradition, while other characteristics point towards another. This makes it very difficult to determine to whom all the skeletons belong. There are up to 1,200 graves, found throughout all six cemeteries: the primary cemetery, the three extensions of the primary, the north cemetery (about 10 minutes away from the primary cemetery) and one south of Wadi Qumran. Despite the large number of tombs present in the cemeteries, Roland de Vaux only excavated 43 graves, while Solomon H. Steckoll examined ten.Schultz 2009, p. 196. and Broshi and Eshel three,Broshi 2004, p.139. However, excavation of Jewish burials has been halted. Of de Vaux's 43 tombs, forty skeletons were fit to examine. Twenty-two of these are now in Germany (Collectio Kurth) and eighteen are in French institutions (Musee de l‚ÄôHomme, Paris and Ecole Biblique, Jerusalem).Broshi 2004, p. 139. The majority of the graves are aligned very neatly with the heads to the south and the feet to the north. Within the southern extension of the primary cemetery, there are also some graves with the head to the east and their feet to the west. The graves themselves are made seen through the piling of field stones on top in an oval shape. Some have larger stones at the head, some at the feet. The graves are dug straight down with the depth ranging from 0.8 meter to 2.5 meters. At the bottom of the graves, is a small cavity, or a loculi. Here the body is laid. From there the body is protected by a stone or clay brick, meant to act as a cap. The bodies themselves are laid on their backs in solitude, or in some cases with a second body. Some of the bodies were buried in coffins, while others merely wrapped in shrouds. They were buried with no possessions except for a minimal amount that had some second temple period pottery buried with them at their feet and some were found with jewelry.Shultz, Brian. Dead Sea Discoveries, Vol. 13, No. 2. (2006), p. 198.  Bedouin Intrusion  Most theories suggest that the bodies were from the second temple period. There are some theories that many of the graves belong to or were borrowed by Muslim Bedouins, considering Bedouins still inhabit that area. Bedouin are known to intrude on other communities cemeteries, so it would not be unusual if they did so at the Qumran location. Part of excavating the graves is to figure out which grave consists of whom. Some characteristics or occurrences that support that the grave may be occupied by a Bedouin opposed to a second temple period being are as follows: * The graves pointing from east to west. Within Islam tradition, Muslims always face east within all of their ritual, including prayer, worship and burial after death. This is because their most sacred site, the Ka‚Äôba, is located in Mecca, which is traditionally thought to be in the east. When laid to rest the dead are believed to face the direction of the Ka‚Äôba by being buried with the heads facing east. However, Mecca is actually south-southeast of the cemetery. The southern extension of the primary cemetery consists of graves pointing east.Shultz, Brian. Dead Sea Discoveries, Vol. 13, No. 2. (2006), pp. 214. * Buried with possessions. Bedouins have been known to bury their dead with the deceased‚Äôs possessions. At the Qumran cemetery, only a few graves were found with possessions such as jewelry and other jewels. Seeing as Bedouins would be the minority at the cemetery, this would explain why there are so little graves with items found with the bodies. Also the community that lived in the Qumran ruins practiced poverty so they would have no need or want for possessions like jewels.Shultz, Brian. Dead Sea Discoveries, Vol. 13, No. 2. (2006), pp. 198, 202, 210. * Multiple bodies in one grave. Along with intruding the cemetery, Bedouins have been known to intrude in actual graves. During excavation, archaeologists have discovered graves that were reopened and had a second body placed in it. In the case of grave 16, it had two skeletons in it. The first body, which was buried first, was found in the cavity of the grave. The second body was found just at the bottom of the grave. What implies that they were buried at separate times was how the first body was clearly disturbed. Also, found on both skeletons is a layer of decayed clay. This was obviously from the cap, as there was not one found when the grave was open. Other graves had their caps fall apart as well but not to this point. It is clear that the cap was handled after an extended period of time, when the second body was put in the grave.Shultz, Brian. Dead Sea Discoveries, Vol. 13, No. 2. (2006), pp. 210, 211, 214. * Separate cemeteries and extensions. The primary cemetery has all of the graves aligned very neatly. Why would the original users of the cemetery suddenly start separate cemeteries with less organization? The Bedouin wanted to bury their people in the dry terrain so they imposed on the primary cemetery. What they did not want though was for their people to be next to the tainted and impure, so they buried them off to the side and in their own traditional way.Shultz, Brian. Dead Sea Discoveries, Vol. 13, No. 2. (2006), pp. 204, 215, 217. * Remains of females and children. According to many sources, including Josephus, Pliny the elder, and Philo, the community in Qumran was composed of celibate males. They remained in existence by adopting the sons of other men, and through an initiation process to accept others into the community. There were supposedly no women; not even for procreation. However, remains of women and children have been recovered from the cemetery. There are many hypotheses for this issue in particular. Some involving the Bedouins and others involving outside knowledge on the Essenes and the Qumran community. Of course there is thought that many of the women were of Bedouin origins, as many of the women and children were found in the cemetery extensions and not the primary cemetery.R. de Vaux, Archaeology and the Dead Sea Scrolls (London: Oxford University Press, 1973), 129.Shultz, Brian. Dead Sea Discoveries, Vol. 13, No. 2. (2006), p. 219. Other cemeteries For many years after the examination of the cemetery, Qumran's tombs were considered unique, as no similar examples had been found. However, more recently a number of cemeteries have yielded single north-south shaft tombs. The small cemetery at Ein el-Ghuweir, 13 kilometers south of Qumran, produced 18 shaft burials of which 13 had a north- south orientation, four were nearly so, and the last was east-west. There were twelve men and six women.Bar-Adon 1977, pp. 16‚Äì17. The archaeologist believed he had found another settlement of the same sect he thought was at Qumran.Note the title of Bar-Adon 1977: \\"Another Settlement of the Judean Desert Sect at 'En el-Ghuweir on the shores of the Dead Sea\\". Further south, the cemetery at Hiam el-Sagha contains twenty north-south tombs, mostly north-south and two were examined. One held a 3‚Äì4-year-old child and the other a 25-year-old man. Shaft tombs have been found in Jerusalem, one at Talpiot, another at Mamila, and at Beth Zafafa around 25 tombs were found.Hachlili 2000, p. 665. Hachlili states, \\"The tombs at Jerusalem (and Hiam el-Sagha) show no real proof that they are Jewish graves, except for their considerable similarity in form to the Qumran burials.\\"Hachlili 2000, p. 666. In 1996 and 1997 a rescue excavation was carried out at Khirbet Qazone near the southern end of the Dead Sea in Jordan. This site has an estimated 3,500 tombs, mostly looted, all with the same characteristics as the Qumran graves. Twenty-three undisturbed burials were examined. These Qumran-type tombs held Nabataeans.Politis 2006.

The CAIS program is oriented around the school mission: \\"Embrace Chinese; become your best self; create your place in the world.\\" To these ends, CAIS offers a Chinese-English dual language immersion curriculum with up to 50% of each school day in Chinese. The school was the first in the United States to have Mandarin immersion education. CAIS also has international travel programs for current students, high school-aged alumni, and faculty and staff. The school organizes trips to Taipei, Beijing, and Yunnan in the fifth, seventh, and eighth grades, respectively. History In 1981, San Francisco Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver searched unsuccessfully for a Mandarin-English school where she could enroll her Taiwanese adopted son. Not finding one in San Francisco she decided to start her own, with the help of deputy district attorney Mimi Luk, Justice Harry Low, Bernard Ivaldi (then Head of French American International School), Maurice Tseng, Yvon d'Argence (then curator of the Asian Art Museum), Joe Chen, Mike Chiu, Donna Furth, Diana Chan, Francisco Hsieh, George Cheng, and Alice Carnes. In September 1981 the school, then known as the Chinese American Bilingual School, began as a Mandarin-English school with an enrollment of 4 kindergarten students operating in the basement of the French American International School. Shirley Lee, a faculty member of the Chinese department at San Francisco State University joined as founding teacher and principal, and remained head of school until her retirement in 2000. In 1989 the school moved to the Presidio of San Francisco. In 1992, a middle school was added (which moved to a new campus in 2015.) In 1997 CAIS moved into its current main campus at 150 Oak St, the former Caltrans headquarters, in partnership with French American International School. CAIS has received national recognition for its program. In 1987 the US Dept of Education designated CAIS the \\"national prototype for Chinese language education in elementary schools.\\" In 2004, CAIS was awarded the Goldman Sachs Prize for Excellence in International Education.

He won a commission for a schutterstuk from the Burgomasters of Amsterdam that still hangs in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam he married Marrite Gerrits in 1649. He worked for years as family portrait painter for Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. His uncle Gabriel was court painter for Charles II of Spain. Though he worked in D√ºsseldorf, he kept his family in Amsterdam, since he was traveling with his patron most of the time anyway. He taught his daughter Adriana to paint, and her talents became so well known, that she was offered a position in D√ºsseldorf as well. Her father wanted her to marry a painter, however, and felt her chances were higher of finding a good one in Amsterdam. Eventually, she did marry the painter Willem Breekveld in 1684, but he died in 1687. After Spilberg's death, she married his successor in D√ºsseldorf, Eglon van der Neer in December 1697. He is known for portraits, landscapes, and historical allegories in the Rembrandt school.

She was the oldest of eight children of Wilhelm II of Hesse-Kassel and his second wife Countess Emilie of Reichenbach-Lessonitz. Louise was a favorite of her father who, it is said, appreciated her intelligence and loving, happy nature. She married Carl August, Count von Bose (1814-1887) in 1845 and the couple lived in Frankfurt, Wiesbaden and Baden-Baden. Louise inherited a vast fortune from her mother, Emilie, Countess von Reichenbach-Lessonitz, the daughter of gold merchant Johann Christian Ortl√∂pp. The estate was valued at 48 million marks at the time of her death, an amount equivalent to billions of dollars in today's economy, and was divided equally among Louise and her six surviving siblings. Louise and Karl von Bose (Bose Memorial on the Luisenstrasse in Kassel. The monument bears the inscription Know Thyself) Count and Countess von Bose established numerous foundations, including a grant of 733,500 goldmarks to Humboldt University, Berlin's oldest institution of higher learning. The endowment was to be used for medical research, both through scholarships to medical students, and for travel grants and assistance to active physicians. Count and Countess von Bose provided substantial funding for the education of underprivileged and neglected children in Kassel, Louise's childhood home, and established The Children's Hospital of Brabant (destroyed in 1943), which cared for Hessian teachers, widows and orphans. They were benefactors of the Senckenberg Natural Research Society in Frankfurt, and the Countess Louise von Bose Foundation funded the creation of the Dental Institute at the University of Marburg. The Bose Museum on Luisenstrasse (Louise Street) in Kassel is named for her, as is the girls' school (Luisenschule) she established in 1855, and which remains active today. The Louise von Bose Foundation passed to the city of Kassel upon her death, and included her extensive art collection, which later formed the core of the New Gallery collection, along with other personal mementos, furniture and documents.

Biography  Magic Fountain, Montjuic Bu√Øgas was born into an educated family in Barcelona, son of the architect Gaiet√† Bu√Øgas. When he was seven, his family moved to Montevideo (Uruguay) but returned to Barcelona in 1910. In 1916, he entered the School of Industrial Engineers of Barcelona; he did not graduate as he started to work as an assistant for the Exhibition of Electrical Industries of Barcelona. Later he continued to study at the √âcole de Civil G√©nie of Paris. In 1922 Bu√Øgas designed his first project with illuminated water fountains for the Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Eugeni d'Ors described his work as a new style of art, the art of agualuz. His most famous work is the Magic Fountain of Montjuic, created for the International Exposition in Barcelona in 1929.The Magic Fountain of Montjuic During the Spanish Civil War he settled in Paris, where he resided until 1942. During these years he gained international reputation and he obtained commissions for projects for international expositions in Paris (1937), Liege (1939), Lisbon (1940), Rome (1953), and the Expo 58 at Brussels. In 1955, he designed the Teatro del Aqua y Luz for the international fair in Santo Domingo. As an inventor he designed a torpedo bomber seaplane in 1914, a device to recover sea sand for construction (1922), a one-person midget submarine (1932), a remote-controlled torpedo guided by ultrasound (1931‚Äì1933) and other devices. Besides his architectural works, Bu√Øgas wrote for magazines and published a number of books. He spent the last years of his life in Cerdanyola del Vall√®s, where he died and is buried.

It is a tropolone derivative and one of the thujaplicins. Hinokitiol is widely used in oral care and treatment products. Hinolitiol was originally isolated in Taiwanese hinoki in 1936. It is almost absent in Japanese hinoki while it is contained in high concentration (about 0.04% of heartwood mass) in Juniperus cedrus, hiba cedar wood (Thujopsis dolabrata) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata). It can be readily extracted from the cedarwood with solvent and ultrasonication. Hinokitiol is structurally related to tropolone, which lacks the isopropyl substituent. Tropolones are well-known chelating agents.  Antimicrobial activity  Hinokitiol has been shown to possess inhibitory effects on Chlamydia trachomatis and may be clinically useful as a topical drug.  Products containing hinokitiol  Hinokitiol is used in a range of consumer products including cosmetics, toothpastes, oral sprays, sunscreens And hair-growth. In 2006, hinokitiol was categorised under the Domestic Substances List in Canada as non-persistent, non-bioaccumulative and non-toxic to aquatic organisms. In April 2020, Advance Nanotek, an Australian producer of zinc oxide, filed a joint patent application with AstiVita Limited, for an anti-viral composition that included oral care products.  History  Hinokitiol was discovered in 1936 by Tetsuo Nozoe from the essential oil component of Taiwan cypress. The compound has a heptagonal molecular structure.  Research directions  In animals  Researchers screening a library of small biomolecules for signs of iron transport found that hinokitiol restored cell functionality. Further work by the team suggested a mechanism by which hinokitiol restores or reduces cell iron. In mammals, they found that when rodents that had been engineered to lack \\"iron proteins\\" were fed hinokitiol, they regained iron uptake in the gut. In a similar study on zebrafish, the molecule restored hemoglobin production.

It is considered to be the first Indian-language newspaper, although some historians contend that the Bengali weekly Bengal Gazetti or Vangal Gazette published by Ganga Kishore Bhattacharya had begun publication earlier.  History  The success of the Bengali monthly Digdarshan encouraged the missionaries of the Baptist Missionary Society to embark on a new venture - the publication of a Bengali newspaper. The initiative was taken by Joshua Marshman and William Ward. At about the same time Harachandra Roy was also planning to start a Bengali newspaper from his own printing press at Chorebagan Street in Calcutta. But before he could bring out his publication, the missionaries published the first issue of Samachar Darpan from the Baptist Mission Press in Serampore on May 23, 1818. The newspaper was published every Saturday and was edited by John Clark Marshman. Its price was 4 annas per copy. It contained news, both Indian and European, collected from various sources, particular from English language newspapers. It also contained brief articles on various subjects. It carried some material of educational value which made it respected and popular among the educated people. Both in typography and contents the Samachar Darpan maintained a fairly good standard. Its coverage of local news was certainly better than any other English or Indian language newspaper. By reprinting news and comments from other Bengali newspapers, the Samachar Darpan enabled its readers to have acquaintance with the different sections of the Bengali opinion. The paper covered seven main beats: news of the government officials, government circulars, news of the European countries other than Britain, new events, birth, obituary and wedding, news of England, history of India and its scholarly books. It published useful information on the appointment of judges, collectors and so on. From July 1829, the newspaper began to appear in both Bengali and English; the Bengali and English sections represented translation of each other. From January 1832, the Samachar Darpan began to be published twice a week - on Wednesday and Saturday. The price was raised from a rupee per month to one and a half. However, as a result of the hike in postage duty, the twice a week publication was discontinued and it again became a weekly newspaper from 8 November 1834. In December 1841, the missionaries decided to discontinue the publication that ended with the last issue of December. The official reason stated was that John Clark Marshman who was still the editor of the newspaper couldn't find sufficient time owing to other pre-occupations. But the actual reason was that the Samachar Darpan, though very successful as a newspaper, had failed miserably in its primary objective - propagation of Christianity. Samachar Darpan had an uninterrupted career till the end of 1841, when the publication was discontinued. By 1836, the circulation had reached 400, which was much higher than any other Indian language publication.  Editorial Board  John Clark Marshman, was the official editor and the editorial staff included some of the most distinguished Bengali Hindu pundits of the time. Marshman's control over the newspaper was only nominal and he had to depend much on his editorial board. Once when the pundits took an extended leave during the Puja, Marshman had to postpone the publications as well and he apologized to the subscribers for the delay.  Government attitude  The Government showed a favourable attitude towards the publication, because the primary objective of the publication was the propagation of Christianity. The Government warned the missionaries that, \\"extra-ordinary precautions must be used not to give the natives cause for suspicion that the paper had been devised as an engine for undermining their religious opinions.\\" The newspaper was allowed to be circulated through the post office at one-fourth of the usual charge. The general tone of the newspaper was moderate as compared to other missionary publications. It had to be so if the newspaper was to gain some patronage from the public. The Government appreciated the usefulness of the newspaper as a medium of communication with the literate public.  Antihinduism  At the beginning, the Hindus were not friendly towards the Darpan. But as time passed their attitude changed towards the paper. Reformist and liberal Hindus, generally found in the Samachar Darpan a valuable ally because of its strong support in favour of social reform and education. But conflict arose when Ram Mohan Roy wrote a book under the title The Precept of Jesus: The Guide To Peace And Happiness where he refuted the supernaturalism of Jesus but admired his moral teachings. The missionaries not content with vindicating the excellence of their own doctrines, attacked all the Hindu shastras as unreasonable, and also abused the Hindus in very offensive terms in Darpan dated 14 July 1821. Doubts were expressed concerning Vedantic teaching about Maya; the teaching of Nyaya Shastra about God and creation; the dualism of Samkhya system; and the interpretation of sacrificial rites in the Mimamsa Shastra. An outraged Ram Mohan Roy, responded to the article in a forceful letter, only to find that his missive was completely ignored by the editor. Spurred by indignation and eager to counterbalance the Christian missionary propaganda Roy started his own Brahminical Magazine where he eventually published the letter.  Persian edition  In 1826, the Government requested the missionaries to bring out a Persian edition of Samachar Darpan to provide better communication with the people of Upper India, which did not yet have any Indian-language newspaper. Accordingly, the Persian version called Akhbar-i-Serampur was published on 6 May 1826. The Government subsidized this newspaper with a monthly grant of 160 rupees. But after two years the publication was discontinued to lack of sufficient patronage.

The line was owned by the Hellenic Electric Railways and operated from 1936 to 1977. History Piraeus-Perama level crossing sign (1935) The construction of a railway line connecting Piraeus to Perama was decided when the Hellenic Navy developed Salamis Naval Base as their main naval facility in the 1890s. The right to build the line was given to the former \\"Athens-Piraeus Railway\\". However no action was taken until 1930, when the successor company \\"Hellenic Electric Railways\\" decided to start construction of the line. Construction was finished in 1935 but services did not start until 20 July 1936, when rolling stock became available by Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie. The line was standard gauge, electrified at 600 V DC, alimented by an overhead line system. The first 710 m of the line operated as a street running tramway along Kondyli Coast, using the existing Piraeus Harbour tramway tracks. After this point the line was separated from road traffic, running on its own railway type right-of-way, laid with Vignoles rail tracks with a mass of , thus allowing even standard railway rolling stock to use the line. As the line was single track, seven passing loops were constructed along its length to allow a frequent service in both directions. No signal system was ever installed and safe circulation was achieved by the use of predefined passing loops per each service. The last 800 m section of the line was located within the naval base area and only Navy personnel bearing a pass, controlled by Naval Police, was allowed to continue. During the World War II German occupation the line was connected to the mainline of the Hellenic State Railways with a curve at Methonis street, allowing freight trains to access Keratsini Port. At Keratsini a short branch was constructed leading to one of the jetties. Due to serious damages on infrastructure and rolling stock caused by Allied bombing of Piraeus on 11 January 1944 the line paused service until April 1945. Most of its time the line was exploited with two kind of regular services: one full length service from Piraeus to the Naval Base, running every 15 minutes with two car formation of the rolling stock (line number 4) and in between, 7,5 minutes after, a short service from Piraeus to St. George at Keratsini aerea with single cars (line number 3). Services continued in the 1960s, surviving the anti-tramway fashion of the era that resulted in the closure of the total of the Athenian and Piraeus metre gauge network owned by the Electric Company of Transports (in Greek ŒóŒªŒµŒ∫œÑœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒïœÑŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒØŒ± ŒúŒµœÑŒ±œÜŒøœÅœéŒΩ - Œó.Œï.Œú.) and in the discontinuity of the rest of the also standard gauged Piraeus Harbour tramway. Plans for renovation of the line and a further extension to Eleusis were announced in the mid-1970s but never came to life and neither the line was modernized as promised nor new rolling stock was acquired. Therefore, due to the shortage of operational rolling stock in regard with the age of the vehicles (almost 40 years old), by 1975 the short service to Keratsini was discontinued and only service on line 4 was provided every 20 minutes using single cars. Eventually the line was closed on 23 March 1977. Most of the right of way of the light railway was finally paved over and became a pedestrianised street. At Thermopylon street, near the church of Ayios Dionysios (St. Dennis) in Piraeus, the tracks survive intact. At several level crossings, they were never removed and are still visible today. A tram vehicle survives in Perama on the old right of way, albeit in a dilapidated condition. Between Tsorpatzoglou Square in Perama (where civilians should alight) and the Naval Base itself, most the infrastructure, including the tracks, platform, shelter and masts, remains intact. Plans are to re-instate the line and connect it to the modern Athens Tram system, running underground because the narrowness of the old right of way makes it unsuitable for laying double track on the surface, and because of the heavy motor vehicle traffic in the area. Rolling stock Railcar no 82 of the defunct Piraeus-Perama suburban light railway (1936-1977) at Pikrodaphni tram station The rolling stock was made in Italy by OM-CGE-Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie. It consisted of 12 (numbered from 71 to 82) very innovative for the time electric vehicles, fitted with pantograph, Scharfenberg couplers and driver operated pneumatic doors. The vehicles could reach a speed of 50 km/h and had enough space for about 100 passengers. The \\"little trains\\", as the locals affectionally called them, were stored and serviced in the depot located in the Hellenic Electric Railways premises, next to Piraeus station. Some survive at various locations e.g. Kasomouli and Pikrodaphne tram stop used as rest places for the tramway drivers, STASY S.A. children's camp at Varybobi, Thission depot of ex ISAP, Greek Railway Museum but none are in good condition. Of course, the section between Methonis street and Keratsini harbour was used by a wide variety of freight trains using steam and diesel traction.

Traditionally, such devices are fabricated from metal mesh and remain in the body permanently or until removed through further surgical intervention. A bioresorbable stent (also called bioresorbable scaffold, biodegradable stent or naturally-dissolving stent) serves the same purpose, but is manufactured from a material that may dissolve or be absorbed in the body. Background The use of metal drug-eluting stents presents some potential drawbacks. These include a predisposition to late stent thrombosis, prevention of late vessel adaptive or expansive remodeling, hindrance of surgical revascularization, and impairment of imaging with multislice CT. To overcome some of these potential drawbacks, several companies are pursuing the development of bioresorbable scaffolds or bioabsorbable stents. Like metal stents, placement of a bioresorbable stent will restore blood flow and support the vessel through the healing process. However, in the case of a bioresorbable stent, the stent will gradually resorb and be benignly cleared from the body, enabling a natural reconstruction of the arterial wall and restoration of vascular function. Studies have shown that the most critical period of vessel healing is largely complete by approximately three to nine months. Therefore, the goal of a bioresorbable or ‚Äútemporary‚Äù stent is to fully support the vessel during this critical period, and then resorb from the body when it is no longer needed.  Base materials  Bioabsorbable scaffolds, or naturally dissolving stents, that have been investigated include base materials that are either metals or polymers. While polymer-based scaffolds had a strong presence at first, they have meanwhile lost some appeal due to safety concerns and focus is now shifted more towards metallic magnesium-based scaffolds.  Metal based  Metal stent candidates are iron, magnesium, zinc and their alloys. Iron stents were shown using an in vivo evaluation method based on the murine abdominal aorta to generate an iron oxide-filled cavity in the vascular wall. This behavior significantly narrowed the lumen and generated a potential site for rupture of the endothelium after stent degradation. Magnesium-based scaffolds have been approved for use in several countries around the world. The only commercially available magnesium-based scaffold consists of a magnesium alloy, approximately 95% of which resorbs within one year of implantation. Thousands of commercially available magnesium-based scaffolds have been implanted. Promising clinical results suggest that magnesium-based scaffolds seem to be a viable option in delivering against the drawbacks of permanent stents. While degrading harmlessly, it has been shown to possess a functional degradation time of about 30 days in vivo. This is much short of the three-to-six month window desired for bioabsorbable stents. Thus, much attention has been given to drastically reducing the rate of magnesium corrosion by alloying, coating, etc. Many novel methods have surfaced to minimize the penetration rate and hydrogen evolution rate (or, in layman's terms, the corrosion rate). One of the most successful has involved the creation of bioabsorbable metallic glasses via rapid solidification. Other, alternative solutions have included the development of magnesium‚Äìrare-earth (Mg-RE) alloys, which benefit from the low cytotoxicity of RE elements. Coatings and sophisticated materials processing routes are currently being developed to further decrease the corrosion rate. However a number of issues remain limiting the further development of Mg biomaterials in general. Recently, zinc was shown to exhibit outstanding physiological corrosion behavior, meeting a benchmark penetration rate of 20 micrometers per year. This contribution also asserts that zinc alloys generally meet or exceed mechanical behavior benchmarks (i.e. ductility and tensile strength). While promising, this material is relatively new, so further work is required to prove that zinc is a feasible base material for a stent. Polymer-based Polymer-based stents have been approved for use in some countries around the world. These are based on poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), chosen because it is able to maintain a radially strong scaffold that breaks down over time into lactic acid, a naturally occurring molecule that the body can use for metabolism. Other polymers in development include tyrosine poly carbonate and salicylic acid. An example of a naturally dissolving stent is the 'Absorb' stent 'produced by Abbott that has several design components and features: base scaffold: a poly(L-lactide) polymer similar to that in dissolvable stitches is shaped into a tube made up of zigzag hoops linked together by bridges; drug-eluting layer': a mixture of poly-D, L-lactide (PDLLA) and everolimus; 'markers': a pair of radio-opaque platinum markers at the ends that allow the device to be visualized during angiography; 'delivery system': a balloon delivery system. Recently however, Polymer-based scaffolds, in particular Poly-L-Lactide Acid (PLLA) scaffolds, have raised serious concerns on the scaffold performance particularly in terms of safety which led to the commercial discontinuation of the main representative Absorb. Clinical research Clinical research has shown that resorbable scaffolds, or naturally dissolving stents, offer comparable efficacy and safety profile to drug-eluting stents. Specifically, the Magmaris resorbable magnesium scaffold has reported a favorable safety profile with low target lesion failure and scaffold thrombosis rates. These clinical results are comparable to thin-strutted drug-eluting stents in similar patient populations. The Absorb naturally dissolving stent has also been investigated in single-arm trials and in randomized trials comparing it to a drug-eluting stent. Early and late major adverse cardiac events, revascularizations, and scaffold thromboses have been uncommon and similar to the Xience DES, a market leader in the drug eluting stent category.Smits P, Ziekenhuis M, Absorb Extend: an interim report on the 36-month clinical outcomes from the first 250 patients enrolled. Presented at Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) conference 2014 in Washington, DC, September 2014 Studies in real-world patients are ongoing. Imaging studies show that the Absorb naturally dissolving stent begins to dissolve from six to 12 months and is fully dissolved between two and three years after it is placed in the artery. Two small platinum markers remain to mark the location of the original PCI. The artery is able to dilate and contract, called vasomotion, similar to a healthy blood vessel at two years.

The park is located between Main and Commerce, east of Griffin in the Main Street District. The park, formerly a parking lot, features perennial gardens, shaded groves, plaza spaces, an interactive fountain, a 10‚Äô high hill which provides topographical relief and views over the central fountain plaza, and a shaded garden grove with movable tables and chairs. In 2006 Belo Corporation (the owners of Dallas-area ABC affiliate WFAA and The Dallas Morning News) committed $6.5 million toward the $14.5 million construction of the park. It is one of several downtown parks planned by the City of Dallas, which include Main Street Garden Park and Pacific Plaza Park. Although scheduled for groundbreaking in 2008 the timeline was delayed due to the discovery of contaminated soil. Soil removal began in July 2010, and the park was re-scheduled to open in early 2012. Belo Garden's design has been the center of local controversy. A 12-foot wall separating the park from the adjacent Metropolitan Building was included for reasons including traffic protection and noise isolation. Professionals called this feature unneeded and anti-urban, but a resolution with Belo was not reached. Shooting On July 7, 2016, Belo Garden became the scene of a mass shooting targeting police officers. Five officers were killed and eight others injured by sniper fire. The shooting occurred at the end of an otherwise peaceful protest against police killings in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. It is the deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 attacks.

Early life  Jonathan Edward Stoll was born in Mamaroneck, N.Y. on November 6, 1953 to Marjorie and Larry Stoll. As a 15-year-old student in Mamaroneck, Stoll decided to raise money for his school by staging a battle of the bands. He also gained valuable experience working backstage at New York- area theaters, and at 18 he was managing a rock band. While at Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I., he continued to stage shows, and when his parents bought a condominium in Fort Lauderdale, he soon began promoting concerts at South Florida drive-in theaters. \\"For $3 or $4 you could go see a concert, film, etc.,\\" he said in 1985. \\"We'd draw 6,000 to 10,000 people.\\"  Fantasma Productions  From those early business spurts sprang Fantasma Productions, which promoted concerts, staged trade shows and published Easy Times, a youth- oriented weekly newspaper. Gradually, the Fantasma empire expanded to Miami and Fort Lauderdale, then throughout Florida, the Southeast and other major venues, including in Las Vegas. Fantasma also was responsible for booking acts for SunFest, Mizner Park Amphitheater in Boca Raton and the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hollywood. Stoll, however, never forgot his adopted hometown. In 1984 he bought the Carefree Center in West Palm Beach. He began a foreign film series and brought small concerts into the theater. He opened an art gallery and a small restaurant, and the old bowling alley became Comedy Corner, one of the top venues for live comedy in the nation and a proving ground for budding young comics such as Dan Whitney, alias Larry the Cable Guy. By 1987, Fantasma had grown to 50 employees who booked and managed more than 500 concerts a year. After hurricanes in 2005 damaged the Carefree Center beyond repair, he bought an abandoned church just north of Southern Boulevard, off Parker Avenue, and created The Theatre, another small concert hall. In the mid-'90s, Stoll was one of the few independent promoters who refused buyout attempts by large corporations, maintaining that it was bad for business and bad for artists. \\"I just think it's unfortunate that there are less options for artists,\\" he told The New York Times in 2006. \\"If you have no options, then you have to deal with one buyer ‚Äì and whatever they decide to pay you.\\" In 2000, he was named Independent Promoter of the Year at the 12th Annual Pollstar Concert Industry Awards in Las Vegas, and in 2007 he served as president of the National Association of Concert Promoters. He rubbed shoulders with the likes of Frank Sinatra; Liza Minnelli; Sting; Elton John; Bruce Springsteen; Kris Kristofferson; Willie Nelson; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; the Red Hot Chili Peppers; and Faith Hill. He was never happier than with family and friends. Shortly before an untimely stroke, he drove his three boys, ages 21, 12 and 8 from Palm Beach to Las Vegas. \\"We had a ball,\\" he said. \\"The kids loved it.

The method was developed during the late 1960s by Harry H. Wise as a more efficient and economic construction process than conventional cast-in-place technologies.\\"Alternative Concrete\\", Construction-Today Magazine, March 2009, p.106 Description Detail of construction The process begins by manufacturing thin precast concrete panels, typically 2.25\\" thick, with the deck's bottom reinforcement included. The panels are then shipped to a jobsite and erected on temporary shoring. Subsequently, the deck's top reinforcing steel is placed on top of the precast panels at the site, and concrete is poured over the entire assembly to achieve the final thickness of the deck. This process effectively accelerates the construction of structures by eliminating the need for costly and time- consuming field forming, and the placing of bottom reinforcement. Polystyrene blocks are often incorporated into the panels during their manufacture in order to create voids, reducing both the quantity and cost of concrete added in the field, and the overall weight of the structure, which further reduces the costs of columns and foundations.http://www.filigreeinc.com The soffits of the panels have a smooth uniform finish as a result of casting them in polished steel molds. This reduces the labor cost and time typically required to grind and patch the soffits of cast-in-place concrete decks to achieve an acceptable aesthetic finish. The method of deck construction can be applied anywhere conventionally poured-in-place concrete is specified, such as flat plate, beam and slab, and wall-bearing structures. Design methods A concrete deck using the Filigree method of construction is designed using virtually the same techniques as are used for cast-in-place decks as prescribed by the American Concrete Institute document ACI318-11.\\"ACI Committee 318 (2011)\\" . ACI 318-11: Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete and Commentary. American Concrete Institute. . Specifically, Section 17, titled \\"Composite Concrete\\" permits the use of precast concrete elements to be attached to cast-in-place concrete provided the requirements of this section are adhered to. The system is designed as a one-way continuous span slab supported on continuous span beams. An analysis of the slab take into account the width of the beams, as the deeper beams behave as slab haunches, proving greater stiffness to the slab near a support. The top reinforcement design for the slabs should be done at both the beam center lines, and at the beam faces. This is because the negative slab moments are typically much less at a beam face, allowing a reduction in the top reinforcement required. The beams are designed with a frame analysis that includes the stiffness of the columns. Punching shear stress is checked Fire resistance Since data is not available to reliably predict the behavior of a composite concrete decks during a building fire, a complete fire test is necessary to determine the structure's sustainability and safety. The standards for such fire tests are given by the building code as \\"Standard Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials UL263\\", ASTM E119, and NFPA, No. 251. The International Building Code requires that only fire resistant components may be used for construction of publicly used structures. All pre-cast concrete elements used for floor construction carry a United Testing Laboratory Certified Fire Resistant Rating.

British Iron Company (1824-1844) The company was formed late in 1824 by John Taylor (1779‚Äì1863), the mining engineer and entrepreneur.For a study of Taylor, see Roger Burt, John Taylor, Mining Engineer and Entrepreneur (Moorland Publishing Co, 1977), although no mention is made of his connection with the British Iron Company His close associates in the venture were the coppersmith James Henry Shears (who was also associated with him in the Real del Monte Company formed earlier the same year) and Robert Small, a merchant, both of London. The capital which the company proposed to raise was ¬£2,000,000, a high figure, but one which reflected the financial euphoria of the time. There was no lack of subscribers to the undertaking. The purpose of the company was stated as being to smelt, manufacture and sell iron; to work iron mines; and to purchase ores from other sources as required. During 1825 the company purchased a number of active ironworks or land on which to build. Of these the principal sites were Abersychan in south Wales, Ruabon in north Wales and Corngreaves near Dudley in England. Following the downturn in the economy that set in 1825 the price of iron then fell, funds became tight, and investors who had made an initial payment for shares were either unable or unwilling to meet further calls. The value of shares in the company fell throughout 1825 and 1826 and by the summer of 1826 there was dissatisfaction among the shareholders at the management of the company. It was claimed that properties had been purchased for sums in excess of their true value, that mineral leases had been taken on terms that were burdensome, and that excessive sums of money had been spent on developing these sites. The available evidence points to a lack of financial acumen and practical experience on the part of the managers. The situation was exacerbated by a pamphlet written by Richard Cort, the son of Henry Cort and cashier of the company until his resignation in February 1826. It protested at the way in which the company's business was being managed, and was critical of the management.Cort, 1826 Following a number of ill-tempered meetings of the subscribers, Taylor and Shears resigned as directors in October 1826 and a new board was elected. The capital of the company was reduced from ¬£2m to ¬£1m, reducing the liability of the subscribers for further calls. Among the new directors was David Mushet who was also appointed manager. Taylor and Shears, together with Small, continued as trustees of the company's property. Under the new board the company's prospects improved; even so, over the fifteen years 1826-40 it made a cumulative net profit of only ¬£129,116 on a paid-up capital of ¬£955,205, or 0.09 per cent per annum.The Times 20 May 1841, 11e It was hampered by heavy royalties and other charges, especially at Abersychan and Corngreaves, from agreements that had been entered into by the company in its formative years. Between 1826 and 1838, also, it was engaged in litigation with the owner of the Corngreaves estate which ultimately went against the company (see below). The suitability of Mushet was questioned at the time of his appointment as managing director in 1826: while he enjoyed a reputation as a metallurgist, Mushet had little practical experience of managing a large ironworks. The company secretary, Harry Scrivenor, a professional ironworks manager, had had little success in this area and is best remembered for his writing.Harry Scrivenor, History of the Iron Trade (London : Longman, 1841; 2nd ed, 1854; repr. Frank Cass, 1967) Accusations of incompetent management continued to be made by the shareholders.See, for instance, The Times 20 May 1841, 11e Following the adverse judgment given in the Corngreaves case the affairs of the company were thrown into disarray. Its already unhappy position was further exacerbated by the severe recession of the early 1840s. Dissension developed between a faction of shareholders and the directors, with subscribers resisting the payment of further calls on their shares and urging that the company be dissolved in order to release them from future financial liability. After several angry meetings it was finally resolved in September 1841 that the company should be dissolved after the liquidation of all its liabilities. In the meantime operations continued as normal. Officials and child employees of the British Iron Company were examined by the Royal Commission on Children's Employment of 1841-2 including Richard Wood, manager of Ruabon, William Wood, manager of Abersychan, and other officials at both sites. The report of the commissioners contains much detailed information on working conditions in the company's plants.Royal Commission on Children's Employment in Mines and Manufactories.

First report. South Staffordshire; 1843 (508) XIII.1 New British Iron Company (1843-1892) Thanks to the personal intervention of a number of shareholders, the old company was saved from the otherwise inevitable liquidation that it faced and the transfer of its assets to the New British Iron Company was authorised by Act of Parliament in August 1843.6 & 7 Vict c. cx. Royal Assent 24 August 1843'The British Iron Company's affairs', article from the London Journal of Commerce reprinted in The Times 9 September 1843 3d All the assets of the old company were sold to the new company for ¬£200,000 and it was finally wound up in 1844 by Act of Parliament.7 & 8 Vict c. xlvi. Royal Assent 24 August 1843 The new company was a more modest undertaking with a capital of ¬£400,000. It remained on a secure financial footing for most of its existence and came to enjoy a high reputation within commercial circles. A contributory factor was the policy of divesting the company of its less profitable properties and concentrating activities on a few core sites. Thus Abersychan was sold to the Ebbw Vale Company in 1852. At about the same time Plas Issa in north Wales was sold to Samuel Giller and Netherton to Noah Hingley & Sons. Hingley also acquired Dudley Wood a few years later. Following the closure of Ruabon ironworks in 1887 operations were confined to Brierley Hill and Corngreaves. The company was registered as a limited liability company in 1883 with a nominal capital of ¬£600,000. In 1887 it went into voluntary liquidation but this was reversed in 1890 after arrangements had been made with the creditors. Plans were then prepared for a reconstruction of the company and the modernisation of the works at Corngreaves, but when the necessary additional capital was not forthcoming the debenture holders petitioned for the appointment of a receiver. A winding-up order was made in June 1892 but in September the company resolved to go into voluntary liquidation. The company continued to trade while arrangements were made for the disposal of its assets. Attempts to sell the entire Corngreaves estate as a single concern were unsuccessful, but the ironworks itself was eventually bought by the former general manager in 1894 while Noah Hingley & Sons bought the rights to the trademarks and goodwill of the company. Sites Wales (South) Abersychan A 60-year lease of property at Abersychan near Pontypool, Monmouthshire was granted in August 1825. The royalties specified in the agreement were exceptionally high. Construction started in 1826 and after a number of constructional mistakes and difficulties the first iron was produced and sold the following year. Six furnaces were built but they were never all in production at once. Nevertheless, output rose to a level that was above the average for south Wales at the time. From about 1840 the works switched from producing bar iron to making rails. The site was sold to the Ebbw Vale Company in 1852 and remained active until 1889. An engine-house, office block and remains of the furnaces can still be seen. The adjacent hamlet named British is all that remains of the housing that was once occupied by the workers at this site. The New British Iron Company retained some property in this area until 1885.Sale notice in The Times 1 August 1885 15e References *, Welsh Journals, National Library of Wales *Michael Atkinson and Colin Baber, The Growth and Decline of the South Wales Iron Industry 1760-1880 (Cardiff : University of Wales Press, 1987, pp 24, 59-61, 94-5 Abercraf A small ironworks had been established at Abercraf, Breconshire in 1824 by the local coalowner, Thomas Harper. Its purpose was to exploit two patents granted to Harper and his fellow coalowner, John Christie (also owner of the Brecon Forest Tramroad) in 1823 (no 4848) and 1824 (no 4909) for the use of the local anthracite coal in smelting. The British Iron Company bought the works in 1825 for ¬£19,541 and at the same time leased minerals on the nearby mountain, Cribarth. The venture soon proved unsuccessful and the furnaces were blown out in 1826 after it was discovered that production costs greatly exceeded the selling price. Coal continued to be worked from the taking; it was still in production in 1841 when the local agent gave a statement to the Children's Employment Commission.

The original intention was to erect ironworks but this plan was abandoned and the company concentrated on producing coal and ironstone for sale. The first significant shipments on the canal were made in 1827 and they continued until about 1837. The company retained a wharf at the seaward end of the canal at Giant's Grave, Briton Ferry until 1877 but no further payments are recorded for tonnage on the canal. References *D.R.

Wales (North) Ruabon The company's principal works in north Wales, generally known as the Ruabon works, were located at Acrefair, near Wrexham, Denbighshire. An ironworks was established here in c1817 by Edward Lloyd Rowland. Following his bankruptcy in 1822 the works were idle until bought by the British Iron Company in 1825 for nearly ¬£135,000 (which included the purchase of the Newbridge works). There were three furnaces, forges and mills which supplied foundry iron chiefly to the Manchester market. From about 1875 the production of iron was spasmodic until the final closure of the works in December 1887. The company also had collieries in the area, including Acrefair, Plas Benion and Wynnstay (or the Green Pit). Following the withdrawal of the New British Iron Company from this district the collieries were taken over by the Wynnstay Collieries Company. References *Ifor Edwards, 'The British Iron Company', Denbighshire Historical Society Transactions, 31 (1982), pp 109‚Äì48; 32 (1983), pp 98‚Äì124 Newbridge A small ironworks at Newbridge, south of Ruabon, appears to have been in existence in 1809. It was acquired by the British Iron Company in 1825 together with the Acrefair site and comprised a forge and a mill. A small quantity of manufactured goods were produced there in 1825 but work was then suspended pending repairs. In 1839 the British Iron Company was still in possession but the single furnace was not in blast. Plas Issa An ironworks at Plas Issa, Ruabon, was listed as the property of the British Iron Company in 1847. It was sold to Samuel Giller in about 1852-4. England (West Midlands) The British Iron Company owned five ironworks in England all of which lay within a few miles of each other to the south of the town of Dudley in the West Midlands. They seem to have been managed as a single unit. Corngreaves Corngreaves was the company's principal site in this region. It was built on freehold property acquired from John Attwood (the brother of Thomas Attwood) to the south of Cradley Heath. The purchase price of ¬£550,000 was approved by Taylor, Shears and Small as managing directors and trustees for the company in June 1825 and the purchase was completed in October 1825. However, by this time the market in iron had collapsed and the company started legal proceedings to have the contract set aside. Even before completion the directors instituted proceedings to recover the down payment of ¬£238,525 on the grounds that they had been misled by Attwood as to the true value and prospects of the estate. The case against Attwood for perjury was heard in February 1828 and he was found not guilty. The trustees then commenced a further action in 1830 to have the contract set aside and this resulted in a verdict in their favour in November 1832. Attwood then appealed to the House of Lords where a final verdict in his favour was given in March 1838. The contract stood and the company were liable for payment in full. This long-running action excited much interest in legal and commercial circles on account of both its length and its cost. The Company's original intention had been to erect six furnaces on the site but by 1847 only two had been built. This number had increased to four by 1854 and six by 1860. Steel making commenced in 1884 and in subsequent years the plant was much modernised. The New British Iron Company continued to operate the works until 1894 when it was bought by a former general manager following the liquidation of the New British Iron Company. Production then continued under subsequent owners until 1912. Both the British Iron Company and the New British Iron Company operated a number of collieries on this property: in 1894 there were six working collieries. Brierley Hill In 1825 the Company purchased ironworks at Brierley Hill from its previous owner, following his failure, for ¬£20,760. It was located on the banks of the Dudley Canal and produced about 150 tons of iron per week and 10 tons of steel. It remained the property of the New British Iron Company until the company was wound up in 1892. Dudley Wood The British Iron Company acquired the ironworks (with four furnaces, forges and rolling mills) from Attwood in 1825. It was connected to Corngreaves by a recently built private railway. It was acquired by Noah Hingley & Sons in about 1860. Netherton The 'old ironworks' at Netherton (with two furnaces) were acquired from Attwood in 1825 as part of the Corngreaves transaction. The company remained in possession until c1852 when the works were sold to Noah Hingley & Sons. The company is also known to have worked coal mines here. Brierley Hill, Dudley Wood and Netherton were all held under lease from the Dudley estate. Withymoor The British Iron Company acquired Netherton Furnaces at Withymoor, Netherton in 1825 when two furnaces were in blast. By 1839 it was in the possession of James Griffin, who already owned 'Withymoor Works' at the same location, where, in 1813 and 1814, he had minted token coins bearing the names 'Withymoor Scythe Works' and 'James Griffin & Sons'. Francis Northall is listed as manager in 1835 Pigot's Directory of Worcestershire.

In its two decades as an independent firm, Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt served as a vehicle for the rollup of more than a dozen brokerage and securities firms led by Sanford I. Weill that culminated in the formation of Shearson Loeb Rhoades. Among the firms most notable partners were Sanford I. Weill, Arthur Levitt, Arthur L. Carter, Marshall Cogan, Roger Berlind and Peter Potoma. History Early history In May 1960, Arthur L. Carter, Roger Berlind, Peter Potoma, and Sanford I. Weill formed Carter, Berlind, Potoma & Weill, the firm's earliest predecessor with capital of $200,000 contributed by the four partners. The firm's first office was at 37 Wall Street, which was followed by an office at 60 Broad Street and then 55 Broad Street. The firm brought in $400,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in revenue in 1960. Carter, Berlind, as it was then known, initially carved out a niche as a small research boutique, though it also offered brokerage and investment banking services The firm was nicknamed \\"the Jewish DLJ\\" in reference to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a former investment banking firm acquired by Credit Suisse in 2000. Sandy Weill In the winter of 1962 the firm learned from the New York Stock Exchange surveillance officer that Peter Potoma face suspension for \\"free riding\\", a violation of the NYSE rules for which he would be suspended by the NYSE for one year. Shortly before his suspension, the other partners forced Potoma's resignation and dropped his name from the firm, becoming Carter, Berlind & Weill. In 1963, Arthur Levitt, the future Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission joined the firm.Arthur Levitt: Career Highlights . Bloomberg BusinessWeek The next year, Marshall Cogan, who had previously worked at CBS and investment firm Orvis & Co., joined the firm as an auto sector research analyst, later becoming a partner. Weill served as the firm's chairman beginning in 1965 and extending through its 1981 merger with American Express, ultimately leaving the firm in 1984. This period was marked by major consolidation of the old white shoe firms on Wall Street. Carter, Berlind under Weill's leadership was a driving force in this consolidation. During this period, Weill led Carter, Berlind, and its successors through more than 15 acquisitions. Carter, Berlind made its first acquisition in 1967, taking over Bernstein-Macaulay Inc., a well-respected firm founded by Peter L. Bernstein, that specialized in investment management.Uchitelle, Louis. \\"Peter L.

New York Times, September 27, 1987 On February 19, 1969, the firm changed its name to Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt (CBWL), with the arrival of Marshall Cogan and Arthur Levitt. The firm was often referred to jokingly by Wall Street peers as Corned Beef With Lettuce. The firm brought in $19 million in 1969 (equivalent to $ million in ). In addition to the firm's notable acquisitions, Carter Berlind, and later CBWL, was known for developing a number of future Wall Street executives. In 1970, Peter A. Cohen joined CBWL-Hayden Stone and in 1973, Cohen became special assistant to Weill. Cohen would go on to serve as Chairman and CEO of the firm's successor, Shearson Lehman Brothers in the 1980s.Brash New Mogul on Wall Street.

Looking for a part-time job while in law school, Plumeri incorrectly assumed CBWL to be a law firm. Despite the confusion, Weill hired Plumeri as a part- time clerk and gofer.Adam Bryant, \\"Corner Office: On Passion and Playing in Traffic\\", The New York Times, December 5, 2009, accessed July 16, 2010 Acquisition of Hayden Stone On September 11, 1970, following the acquisition of Hayden, Stone & Co., the firm was renamed CBWL-Hayden, Stone, Inc. to capitalize on the brand name of the older and much larger, albeit financially challenged, Hayden Stone. Hayden Stone, founded in 1892 had a large retail network and a significant investment banking department. Additionally, Hayden Stone had grossed $113 million in 1968, five times its gross in 1960, earning significant profits. However, in the late 1960s, Hayden Stone had difficulties with its administrative functions, particularly as the size of the firm had expanded so rapidly. The firm was ultimately forced by the New York Stock Exchange to cut back on its trading. By 1970, the firm was effectively controlled by a group of creditors. CBWL negotiated to acquire the bulk of Hayden Stone from its creditors including the firm's name, 28 of its branches with 500 brokers and roughly 50,000 accounts. By acquiring Hayden Stone, CBWL launched itself from relative obscurity to become a major firm on Wall Street.Stone, Amey and Brewster, Mike. King of capital: Sandy Weill and the making of Citigroup, 2002. In 1970, the firm employed more than 1,500 people, and brought in nearly $12 million in revenue. In fact, the acquisition was so transformative for CBWL that in 1972, the CBWL was dropped from the name and the firm became Hayden Stone, Inc. in 1972. In August 1973, Marshall Cogan left the firm after disputes with his fellow partners to focus on leveraged buyouts. Cogan would go on to acquire a series of businesses included General Felt Industries, Knoll, the 21 Club and Sheller-Globe Corporation but would be unsuccessful in his bids to acquire the Boston Red Sox, Sotheby's and L.F.

In 1973, during the 1973-1974 stock market crash, the firm acquired H. Hentz & Co., a venerable Wall Street investment banking, brokerage and commodities firm founded in 1850, and Saul Lerner & Company. As economic conditions worsened in 1974, Weill had the opportunity to acquire Shearson, Hammill & Co., founded in 1902. Following the merger with Shearson Hammill & Co., the name of the combined company was changed again, this time becoming Shearson Hayden Stone. Weill adopted the Shearson brand, which had become a household name in the 1960s through a series of television commercials that suggested \\"If You Want To Know What's Going On On Wall Street, Ask Shearson Hammill.\\"Commercial Classics: Shearson Hammill Commercial The firm had 63 offices in the US and internationally supported by a well- regarded securities research department.Benn, Alec.

New York Times, August 12, 1986 a regional brokerage with an excellent equity research department. With these acquisitions, in 1977 the combined firm was the seventh largest investment banking firm in the United States, with revenues of $134 million (equivalent to $ million in , more than triple its 1972 levels just five years earlier) and more than 4,000 employees nationwide. Finishing the puzzle ‚Äì Loeb Rhoades In 1979, Weill and the firm's successor, now Shearson Hayden Stone completed their most ambitious merger to that point, acquiring Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. to make Shearson Loeb Rhoades the second largest investment banking firm. With capital totaling $250 million, Shearson Loeb Rhoades trailed only Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith as the securities industry's largest firm. Until shortly before the acquisition by Shearson, the firm, known as Loeb, Rhoades & Co., was one of Wall Street's oldest and most successful firms. In 1977, Loeb Rhoades acquired Hornblower, Weeks, Noyes & Trask to form Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. The Hornblower merger turned out to be disastrous for Loeb Rhoades. The two firms incurred significant costs attempting to merge their back office operations, both of which had issues prior to the merger. By the end of 1978, less than a year after the merger, the combined firm was losing millions of dollars. During Mothers Day Weekend 1979, Loeb and Shearson agreed to a merger to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades.

Established on 14 July 1942, it was bestowed on personnel from the former Soviet Union (Ostvolk in German, literally \\"Eastern people\\"), who volunteered to fight alongside German forces. The Medal is sometimes called the Ostvolk Medal or Eastern People's Medal, (German: Ostvolkmedaille). In addition to the Ostvolk medal, eastern volunteers were also eligible for German war medals and badges. The medal features an octagonal (eight pointed) star with a plant pattern in the centre. There are two classes: *1st class - 50 mm in diameter, attached to the left uniform pocket by a pin and clasp. It could be awarded in gold or silver. *2nd class - 40 mm in diameter worn on a 32 mm wide ribbon from the left chest. It could be awarded in gold, silver or bronze, each having a separate ribbon design: **gold: green with a red stripe towards each edge; **silver: green with a white stripe towards each edge; **bronze: plain green. Each version of both classes could be awarded either with swords for bravery or without swords for merit. The 1st class was only awarded to those who had already received the 2nd class although, exceptionally, the two classes could be awarded together. Women, for example nurses, were also eligible. From November 1942, German officers and NCOs serving with Ostvolk units were eligible for the 1st class and 2nd class in silver with swords, provided they held the corresponding class of the Iron Cross. In February 1944, German personnel became eligible for the 1st class and 2nd class without swords where they held the corresponding class of the War Merit Cross with swords. Wear of Nazi era awards was banned in 1945. In 1957 the Eastern People's Medal was among the World War II decorations re- authorised for wear by the Federal Republic of Germany. While many awards were re-designed to remove the swastika, the original Eastern People's Medal could be worn unaltered as it did not bear this symbol.

Rod is the Slavic Great God, Father of the Universe. The album has a large cast of guest vocalists and musicians, most notably on the track \\"Na Moyey Zemle\\" which features vocalists from M√•negarm of Sweden, Obtest of Lithuania, Menhir of Germany, Skyforger of Latvia, and Heidevolk of the Netherlands. Each sings in their native language, playing the role of warriors from that region describing their homeland to a traveler. The album is one of the band's few releases on limited edition double-LP, released in a hand-numbered edition of 500. The album is packaged in a gatefold with plain white inner sleeves and pressed in Germany. The album reverses the order of two songs \\"Pritcha\\" and \\"Na Moey Zemle\\" in comparison to the CD version, leaving four songs to each side of a record except for side B which has only the two.NPR 307LP; Copy Number 010/500 Reception The album received positive international reviews. About.com marked a combination of powerful vocals with deep and dynamic compositions but observed a mostly light-hearted atmosphere reminiscent of Finnish humppa metal acts like Finntroll and Korpiklaani. The reviewer rated Arkona as one of the best pagan bands. The German Sonic Seducer wrote that this album was more epic and more orchestral but also more playful than previous releases. Metal Hammer Germany lauded singer Arkhipova's vocal range and the consequent traditionally Russian melody lines. The album was favourably reviewed by Kerrang! which emphasized that, unlike many in this subgenre, Arkona \\"are genuine pagans and formed this band in an effort to mirror their philosophies.\\" \\"The title-track and \\"Nevidal\\" provide galloping warrior metal, while the bouncy \\"Yarilo\\" is Jolly Roger flying Turisas-style fun that sadly clock in at less than three minutes.

It operates subsidiary schools Madison School of Healthcare, PCDI Canada, and James Madison High School. History Ashworth College headquarters in Peachtree Corners, Georgia Since its founding in 1987, Professional Career Development Institute (PCDI) has developed a large selection of distance- learning programs and has enrolled more than 2 million students in its high school, career, and degree programs. James Madison High School (JMHS) was established in 1996 to aid students who need an alternative approach to a high school education. JMHS provides the curriculum needed for students to complete one to four years of high school course work leading to a high school diploma. In 2000, PCDI established Ashworth College to offer associate degree programs to students who need a relaxed approach to a college education. Ashworth College started offering master‚Äôs degree programs in 2004 and bachelor‚Äôs degree programs in 2007. In 2007, all schools under PCDI merged under the Ashworth College umbrella. In May 2016 the Federal Trade Commission and Ashworth College entered a settlement in which the college agreed to alter its advertising claims. The commission had charged the college with deceptively marketing its online college degree and career-training programs; it stated that some Ashworth programs failed to meet the basic educational requirements set by state licensing boards for careers or jobs such as real estate appraisers, home inspectors, elementary school educators and massage practitioners. The commission also claimed that the college's credits were represented as fully transferable, although it lacked supporting data that other colleges and universities would accept their credits. Academics Ashworth offers 3 high school programs, 10 career certificates, over 60 career diplomas, 15 undergraduate certificates, 30 associate degree programs, 8 bachelor's degree programs, 6 graduate certificates, and 10 master's degree programs. Its programs are non-synchronous and can be started at any time. Accreditation and licensing Ashworth College is nationally accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission. The RN to BSN program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and the associate degree in veterinary technician program is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Committee on Veterinary Technician Education and Activities (CVTEA). Ashworth College is also authorized by the Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission to offer instruction in career programs, undergraduate certificates, associate degree, bachelor's degree, and master's degree programs. James Madison High School is regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement. Ashworth Community The Ashworth College Community gives students the opportunity to participate in online study groups, clubs and organizations and receive tutorial assistance, career advice and student support. Students connect through discussion threads, email, chat and webinars. The Ashworth College student body includes students from all 50 states and many countries. Admissions and financial aid To be accepted to Ashworth College, students must be at least 16 years old or have an enrollment form filled out by a parent or guardian. College degrees require a high school diploma or a GED to enroll. Many career diplomas and certificate courses have no prerequisites. Ashworth College does not accept or offer federal or financial aid or provide student loans, claiming that this is due to their mission to make the tuition affordable to all.

History Lasting for a century, the settlement corresponded to the initial Romanization of the northwest corner of the Iberian Peninsula (from the late 1st century BCE to the first half of the 1st century AD, or as late as the year 70).Ant√≥nio Jos√© Marques da Silva (20 April 2012), p.1Carla Sofia Martins (20 November 2004) Much of the knowledge of this culture came from similar great settlements in the region, such as the Cit√¢nia de Santa Luzia. This culture is distinguished from others in the region by the scope of the spatial organization and size, that implies a proto-urban structure, and the elevated quantity of the exogenous artifacts.Ant√≥nio Jos√© Marques da Silva (20 April 2012), p.2 The settlement is considered modest, with characteristics common for the larger settlements: such as a wall with monumental entrance-ways; the organization of the family living spaces and barrios; paved floors; a circular great house with bunk seating along the wall; and a home with rectangular courtyard, in addition to Roman coins in silver and bronze, amphorae, and rings. During the course of the investigations, numerous Haltern 70 baetic amphorae were collected, about less that 2775, or actually the largest group in the Roman Empire and twice the quantity discovered in the district capital Bracara Augusta. Its position along one of the largest rivers, meant that it was located in a privileged place for the Romans, crossroads of alluvial and mineral exploration along the river. The presence of coins and jewellery shouldn't diminish the fact that the majority of the ceramics (about 80%) corresponded to regional pottery. The remainder of the elements are characterized by a provincialism that is difficult to reconcile with a modern urban environment, implying an urban-rural mix. The presence of the large castro culture community was incentive enough for the president of the Municipal Council, and local authority of Perre, to request a meeting with the Instituto de Estradas de Portugal (IEP) in order to save the castro or mitigate its complete destruction with the construction of the A228/IC1. Architecture Two-thirds of the site is crossed by a construction corridor of the A28/IC1 Autoestrada (Viana do Castelo-Caminha). Owing to this fact, an emergency archaeological intervention, directed by Ant√≥nio Jos√© Marques da Silva, was funded between June 2004 and July 2005, completed by the company AMS-An√°lise e Consultadoria Arqueol√≥gica Lda. The area of the intervention covered an area of , and resulted in the movement of of dirt and the archaeological remnants that included 14 tonnes of ceramics, and more than 1000 lithic artifacts. The investigation covered a period of three years (financed by AMS) and involved the chrono-strategraphic analysis of the artifacts, revealing that field's occupation during the course of a century. There were no indications that the spaces were occupied prior to this period. The excavations revealed a traditional indigenous architecture, using circular dwellings generally completed with a vestibule in the form of a crab's pincer and oblong-shaped barns.

Roger Bray and John T. Curtis,Bray, J. R. and J. T. Curtis. 1957. An ordination of upland forest communities of southern Wisconsin. Ecological Monographs 27:325-349. is a statistic used to quantify the compositional dissimilarity between two different sites, based on counts at each site. As defined by Bray and Curtis, the index of dissimilarity is: : BC_{ij} = 1 - \\\\frac{2C_{ij}}{S_i + S_j} Where C_{ij} is the sum of the lesser values (see example below) for only those species in common between both sites. S_i and S_j are the total number of specimens counted at both sites. The index can be simplified to 1-2C/2 = 1-C when the abundances at each site are expressed as proportions, though the two forms of the equation only produce matching results when the total number of specimens counted at both sites are the same. Further treatment can be found in Legendre & Legendre.Pierre Legendre & Louis Legendre. 1998. Numerical ecology. 2nd English edition. Elsevier Science BV, Amsterdam. For a simple example, consider two aquariums: Tank one: 6 goldfish, 7 guppies and 4 rainbow fish. Tank two: 10 goldfish and 6 rainbow fish. To calculate Bray-Curtis, let‚Äôs first calculate C_{ij} , the sum of only the lesser counts for each species found in both sites. Goldfish are found on both sites; the lesser count is 6. Guppies are only on one site, so they can‚Äôt be added in here. Rainbow fish, though, are on both, and the lesser count is 4. So C_{ij} = 6 + 4 = 10 . S_{i} ( total number of specimens counted on site i) = 6 + 7 + 4 = 17 , and S_{j} (total number of specimens counted on site j) = 10 + 6 = 16 . This leads to BC_{ij} = 1 - (2 \\\\times 10) / (17 + 16) = 0.39 . The Bray‚ÄìCurtis dissimilarity is directly related to the quantitative S√∏rensen similarity index QS_{ij} between the same sites: : \\\\overline{BC}_{ij} = 1 - QS_{ij} . The Bray‚ÄìCurtis dissimilarity is bounded between 0 and 1, where 0 means the two sites have the same composition (that is they share all the species), and 1 means the two sites do not share any species. At sites with where BC is intermediate (e.g. BC = 0.5) this index differs from other commonly used indices.Bloom, S.A. 1981. Similarity indices in community studies: Potential Pitfalls. Marine Ecology--Progress Series 5: 125-128. The Bray‚ÄìCurtis dissimilarity is often erroneously called a distance (\\"A well-defined distance function obeys the triangle inequality, but there are several justifiable measures of difference between samples which do not have this property: to distinguish these from true distances we often refer to them as dissimilarities\\"). It is not a distance since it does not satisfy triangle inequality, and should always be called a dissimilarity to avoid confusion. Bray‚ÄìCurtis and Jaccard indices are rank-order similar, but, Jaccard index is metric, and probably should be preferred instead of the default Bray-Curtis which is semimetric.

In The Vampire Diaries, set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, she is portrayed by Nina Dobrev. In the books, Elena was blonde, popular, selfish and a \\"mean girl\\". However the show's producers, Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson, felt that it wasn't the direction they wanted to go with their heroine in The Vampire Diaries television series. Instead, she became a nicer, relatable and more of \\"the girl next door\\" type, until her life gets flipped upside down when she meets the Salvatore Brothers. In April 2015, Nina Dobrev announced that she would be departing the series after the sixth-season finale. Much of Elena's story revolves around her relationships with vampires Stefan Salvatore and his older brother, Damon. It is revealed that Elena is a Petrova Doppelg√§nger, which is thus responsible for her being identical to her ancestor, Katherine Pierce (n√©e Katerina Petrova). This also has the implication of making her a supernatural creature. Dobrev portrayed the \\"conniving\\" Katherine as well, who is opposite of Elena. The actress stated that it has been a challenge distinguishing the two, and enjoys playing them both. In the television series's fourth season, Elena becomes a vampire and dies then deals with the struggles that come with her change. She took the cure and became human again towards the end of the sixth season. In the finale of the sixth season, Kai linked Elena to Bonnie's life by magic. Elena will only wake up when Bonnie dies in around 60 years. She was locked inside the Salvatore tomb, then relocated to a warehouse in Brooklyn, New York in the seventh season, then back to Mystic Falls. In late 2016, when it was announced that the eighth season would be the final season, Dobrev was in talks about returning to the television series to reprise her role in the final episode. After much speculation. Dobrev's return was confirmed on January 26, 2017, via an Instagram post. Dobrev appeared in the final episode of the show as both Elena and her evil doppelg√§nger Katherine Pierce. Casting and portrayal On March 9, 2009, it was announced that Bulgarian-born Canadian actress Nina Dobrev, known for her portrayal of Mia Jones on Degrassi: The Next Generation, had joined the cast of The Vampire Diaries as Elena. She was the second cast member to be announced following Steven R. McQueen, who plays Elena's brother Jeremy Gilbert. Steve West Cinema Blend said the vampire brothers' battle over Elena will wreak havoc on the entire town.\\". Executive producer Kevin Williamson recalled Dobrev auditioning while having the flu, which he described as the \\"worst audition ever\\", and they \\"didn't even look at her a second time\\". Dobrev went back home to Canada, yet, still wanting the part, she submitted a videotape audition, which saw her cast as Elena Gilbert. Dobrev said that after reading the script, she was drawn to Elena because she was \\"this average girl who was damaged in many ways\\". Initially, she believed that she would be playing the \\"bad girl\\" Elena from the books, but the show wanted to go in a different direction for the character. After researching, Dobrev discovered she would also play Elena's 534-year-old vampire doppelg√§nger Katherine Pierce whose characteristics are the \\"complete opposite\\". Dobrev described this as \\"one of the rarest, coolest opportunities in television, to play two people on the same medium\\". She had confessed that she enjoys playing Katherine more than Elena. Dobrev stated that she changes her appearance to distinguish Elena from her doppelg√§nger, Katherine; \\"Changing my hair helps me transform,\\" she told Glamour. Additionally, she said \\"I think I have one of the coolest characters on the show ‚Äî I get to play two completely different people on opposite sides of the spectrum and I just have so much fun doing it\\". Dobrev felt that her biggest challenge on The Vampire Diaries was distinguishing Katherine and Elena, and found it \\"interesting\\" to create a whole new character. In the novels, Katherine originated from Germany. However, in the television series, she is Bulgarian, as is Dobrev, who can speak the language fluently . Dobrev said, \\"The writers heard me speaking Bulgarian to my mom on the phone while I was on set one day. One thing led to the other and voila\\".  Development  Characterization Nina Dobrev, who plays Elena Gilbert, at PaleyFest 2014 In the books, Elena is considered \\"one of the popular girls\\" at her high school and always gets \\"anything she wants\\". Executive producer of the television show, Julie Plec, said the Elena from the books was \\"really kind of selfish\\". In The Vampire Diaries, Elena's \\"selfishness\\" in the books as a human was never explored, because it \\"didn't ever feel like a characteristic\\" the show wanted for their heroine. Plec said \\"We kind of abandoned that queen- bee popular complex that in a lot of ways defined early Elena in the books\\", while feeling that Elena's actual flaw is her \\"deep, deep connection to other people\\". In the books, Elena had blonde hair, but has brown hair in the television show. Describing Elena from the books, Dobrev said she is \\"one of those mean girls that gets what she wants, popular . . . and she's blonde and blue eyed\\". Williamson told her that \\"the angle we wanted to go for was the relatable, nice, girl next door, who the audience roots for\\". Katherine, on the other hand, is penned as a \\"conniving, narcissistic, bitch\\". Describing Elena years later, Dobrev said she evolved from a \\"younger, naive, sad, young girl\\" to a \\"strong woman\\". Romances Before The Vampire Diaries, Elena dated Matt Donovan (Zach Roerig), who was unable to move past his feelings for her initially after their break-up. Elena began dating Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley), and later discovered he was a vampire. As the episodes progressed, she developed a connection with Stefan's adventurous brother Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder), who consumes human blood, unlike Stefan, who has an animal blood diet. Speaking about the different qualities Stefan and Damon bring to Elena, Dobrev said they have \\"different qualities that are very appealing\\", which combined make \\"the perfect man\\". She said \\"Stefan is committed and sweet and protective and loving, and Damon is spontaneous and crazy and fun and exciting\\". Dobrev with her Vampire Diaries co-stars Paul Wesley (Stefan) and Ian Somerhalder (Damon) at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International. After Elena became a vampire, she became sired to Damon and they slept together. According to Plec during an interview with TVLine, Elena \\"really believes what she feels is 100 percent genuine and real\\", and the couple \\"wants to be together and realizes that they shouldn‚Äôt, yet really wants to. So what do they do?\\" Stefan became heartbroken, feeling angry and betrayed, and lashed out at Damon and Elena. In the season 4 finale, an unsired Elena confirms that she is in love with Damon, and the two kiss passionately. At the end of season 6, the two plan to become human, get married, and have children together, but their dream is abruptly compromised by Kai, who puts Elena into a magical coma. Damon remains entirely devoted to Elena throughout the remaining two seasons as Elena sleeps peacefully. In the season 8 finale, she is revealed to be happily married to Damon. Transition Executive producers Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson agreed that in the book series, Elena was turned into a vampire too early, which was around page 200 of The Awakening. Elena's transition into a vampire was planned for two years. Plec said: \\"That felt obviously too soon, and rushed, and we didn‚Äôt want to make a show about a teenage girl who instantly becomes a vampire. But we always knew that her journey would take her there eventually\\". At the second season's conclusion, Elena was nearly turned into a vampire. Dobrev was happy that she wasn't, because she felt \\"it would have been too soon\\", and also didn't think it was something Elena or she wanted. In the show's third season, Elena has a brain hemorrhage which was initially thought to be a concussion, and begins to die. In what was described by the International Business Times as \\"the moment Vampire Diaries fans have been waiting for\\", Elena had to choose whether to be driven to Damon or Stefan to say goodbye to. At the time, Klaus was killed, meaning all vampires sprouting from his bloodline also die, which includes Damon and Stefan. She picks to say goodbye to Stefan. However, all these vampires end up surviving when Klaus never really dies. To save her, Doctor Meredith Fell (Torrey DeVitto) fed Elena Damon's blood. Rebekah Mikaelson kills Elena on Wickery Bridge, unaware of the vampire blood in her system. She woke up as a vampire at the end of the season. The Hollywood Reporter interviewed Plec, and described her transition as \\"monumental changes\\" which would have Elena in for a \\"wild ride\\". Plec said Elena becoming a vampire is \\"an awakening of a person who is about to go through a lot of changes\\", and \\"she is going to evolve as a person and her relationships are going to evolve accordingly\\". While Stefan was afraid she would hurt someone, Damon thought it was inevitable and wanted to \\"rip the band-aid off\\". Plec felt that \\"She‚Äôs, unfortunately, not getting the same advice from the two people she values most in the world. It‚Äôs going to make it more difficult for her\\", while describing the situation as \\"a whole new Elena and it‚Äôs a whole new day. It‚Äôs a different dynamic between the three of them especially\\". Television series Backstory Elena Gilbert is born on June 22, 1992 in Mystic Falls, Virginia to John Gilbert (David Anders) and Isobel Flemming (Mia Kirshner) while they were still in highschool. With the help of John's brother Grayson, Isobel and John flee town days later, leaving Grayson and his wife Miranda to adopt Elena as their own. A doctor, Grayson fakes a birth certificate so that it appeared Elena was his daughter with Miranda. The next year, Miranda and Grayson had a child of their own, Jeremy Gilbert. Elena dates her childhood friend Matt Donovan, who was her first love. On 23 May 2009, Elena is picked up by her mother and father after getting in a fight with Matt while attending the party. The three of them later end up in a car accident, with their car driving off a bridge. Stefan Salvatore finds them, and saves Elena, but it was too late to save Grayson and Miranda, who died. It remained unknown for months who saved Elena, and it was considered a miracle that she lived. Her relationship with Matt ended when they broke up. Storyline Season 1 Elena, still empty after losing her parents, begins to fit back into school. She meets a mysterious new student named Stefan Salvatore. They connect instantly, and begin dating. She meets his older and malevolent brother, Damon. After researching, Elena realizes Stefan was alive in 1953. It is later revealed that he is a 162-year-old vampire. Damon also begins falling for Elena. Elena finds a picture of a woman named Katherine Pierce who looks exactly like her. Stefan reveals that it is the woman who made him and Damon feud 145 years ago, and the person who turned them into vampires. He also told her that he is the person that saved her the night of her parents death. At the end of season one, Elena discovers that Grayson and Miranda weren't her biological parents, and that a woman named Isobel and her uncle John, who she grew up hating, were. Season 2 In season two, she learns that she is a Petrova doppelg√§nger, having an appearance just like Katherine Pierce, which means that she has to be sacrificed to release Klaus' werewolf side. The sacrifice later happens, but Elena is saved, because John sacrificed himself for her after being put under a spell by Bonnie. However, her aunt Jenna is turned into a vampire and, as part of the sacrifice, is killed by Klaus, leaving Elena without a guardian. In the season two finale, while Damon is dying due to a werewolf bite, she forgives him for forcing her to drink his blood and kisses him with the thought that it might be Damon's last day, however Damon gets cured by drinking Klaus' blood. Season 3 In season three, Elena does everything in her power to make Stefan get his humanity back, which was turned off by Klaus as payment for saving Damon from a werewolf bite in the latter part of season two. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Damon while working together on saving Stefan and trying to defeat Klaus, eventually even sharing a kiss. She later admits to Stefan that she has feelings for Damon as well but that she never stopped loving Stefan. While in Denver together, Elena kisses Damon, later telling him that she doesn't know how she feels about him. It is eventually revealed that Elena met Damon the night of her parent's death, though he compelled her to forget. She eventually chooses Stefan in the season finale but before she can tell him, Elena drowns while having vampire blood in her system. During the last moments of season three, she awakens as a vampire in transition. Season 4 In season four, Elena is faced with the tough decision of whether to die or to feed on human blood so she can fully transition into a vampire. Elena, after realizing Stefan's desperation to keep her alive, decides to complete her transition. Her relationship with Stefan ends, allowing her to begin a proper romance with Damon. Although, it is later revealed there is a sire bond between them. Sometime later whilst searching for the cure for vampirism, Jeremy is fed to the immortal Silas by Katherine. As a result, Damon used the sire bond to convince her to turn off her humanity, due to her incredible grief over losing her brother and the last remaining member of her family. Elena became ruthless without her emotions, going on killing sprees and being very hateful towards her friends. Towards the end of season four, Damon kills Matt in front of Elena to trigger her grief. After revealing that Matt had the Gilbert Ring on, Elena's humanity was switched on and her emotions were focused on hate towards Katherine for killing Jeremy. Season four ended with Bonnie as a ghost after bringing Jeremy back to life and Elena fed Katherine the cure for vampirism in a moment of desperation as she was about to be killed. Elena had chosen Damon as the Salvatore that she loved. Season 5 In season five, Elena starts at Whitmore College and is happy after spending the summer with Damon. There she realises that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe in a river constantly drowning. She and Damon then find the safe, only to find a dead body there meaning that someone opened the safe and Stefan is a Ripper again. However, Qetsiyah had fried Stefan's brain causing him to suffer amnesia. While trying to bring him back, they almost kiss meaning that she still feels something for him. Qetsiyah soon brings back Stefan's memories and says that Elena and Stefan were always meant to be as the Universe had to unite the doppelg√§ngers of Silas and Amara. This leaves Damon and Elena questioning their relationship. Later on, she is kidnapped and experimented on by Wes Maxfield, and she learns that her father also used to experiment on vampires. Later, when Katherine is about to die as a result of all of her years catching up with her as a result of having the cure in her system, Katherine uses a spell and possesses Elena, a fact that her friends were initially unable to deduce. But once they did, they trapped Katherine and left her with no escape. Stefan stabbed her with the traveller dagger, but ghost Katherine reveals to Bonnie, shortly before trying to cross into the Other Side, that she had injected Dr Maxfield's enhanced ripper/werewolf virus into Elena's body, infecting Elena. The gang is eventually able to find an antidote. She, unfortunately, loses trust in Damon, partly because he killed her friend Aaron, so they break up, but realise they cannot survive to be apart and get back together. Once Markos and his traveller army begin to take over Mystic Falls, setting an anti-magic barrier around the town, the gang comes up with a plan to take out the travellers by killing them all at the same time, overpowering the anchor to the Other Side AKA Bonnie and creating a possible way out of the now-collapsing Other Side. Elena and Damon drive into the gas-filled Mystic Grill with most of the travellers in it, blowing it up and killing most of the people in it, including Elena and Damon. She wakes up as a ghost and finds her body, sending her to Bonnie, where she passes to the Other Side, and she and many others are able to pass back to the land of the living afterwards. But the spell that allows this is broken before Damon passes back through, and as Bonnie is the anchor, she is a part of the Other Side and shall, therefore, disappear along with it. This leaves the gang mourning the loss of Damon and Bonnie in the season finale. Season 6 In season six, Elena starts back at Whitmore, and is unable to set foot in her hometown. She is also unable to recover from Damon's death and starts lurking the borders of Mystic Falls in order to grab civilians, drink their blood, then compel them to forget, but as spirit magic no longer works in Mystic Falls, any of her victims who cross into the town remember the ordeal, putting her identity as a vampire at risk when one of her victims, Sarah, comes to town. Elena begs Alaric to compel her to forget that she ever loved Damon, which Alaric is able to do, due to him being an Enhanced Original, with the ability to compel other vampires. She eventually wears him down and asks her friends to never remind her once the compulsion had been done. After a number of failed attempts, Alaric successfully compels her to forget her love for Damon. She however leaves Alaric with some of her reminders of Damon, should she ever need them again. She is told of her former feelings for Damon soon afterwards, but decides to stay the way she is, as she doesn't want to go back to being unhappy again. She starts to date her classmate, Liam. Once Damon comes back to life, Alaric tries to convince Elena to allow him to undo the compulsion, a decision she is reluctant to make. She eventually decides to have him undo it, but Alaric goes back to being human again after crossing into Mystic Falls, causing him to lose his vampire status (he only stayed alive because his once fatal human injuries were healed), meaning he will not be able to do so. She is then left to finally come face-to-face with Damon and see if she'll still feel the same way about him. They eventually rekindle their relationship, Elena takes the cure that Bonnie gave Damon. At Alaric's wedding, Kai ruins their wedding and casts a sleeping spell on Elena, linking her life to Bonnie's. She makes a sacrifice to let Bonnie live out her life until it is her turn. She bids goodbye to her friends and loved ones before parting ways but knows that she will see Damon, Stefan and Caroline again one day. Season 7 Elena doesn't make an appearance but is heard calling Damon's name when he visits the Armory vault. It was a way of Sybil, the Siren, luring him into a trap. Season 8 In the final episode, Elena makes an appearance. When a weakened Bonnie dies from the sounding bell, she meets Elena in a dream-like forest. Elena hugs her and wonders if she really has died. Enzo appears and says it isn't her time and takes Bonnie back to the world of the living. When Bonnie wakes up, it was Stefan who resuscitated her. Elena, asleep, is then taken to the Mystic Falls High School by Katherine and places her in the boiler room. Stefan tries to rescue Elena, but Katherine had Kai spell the boiler room, so that Elena can't be taken out of the room. After Bonnie had deflected the hellfire back into the bell, Bonnie passes out. Elena wakes up and wanders the school. Stefan meets up with her. It looks like Bonnie has died, but in fact Elena is still sleeping and Stefan's ghost came to visit her in her dream. He had taken the place of killing Katherine instead of Damon, since Damon is human after Stefan gave him the cure. He came to say goodbye. After a tearful hug and saying goodbye, Stefan goes into afterlife. Elena finally wakes up because Bonnie has broken the spell over her. Elena reunites with Damon and the rest of the gang. Elena gives Caroline the message Stefan whispered into her ear, saying he did hear her voice message and will love her forever. In the epilogue, Elena continued to study at medical school. After finishing her education, she went back to Mystic Falls and lived together with Damon, happily married for a long time. After living out her life, she crosses over to the afterlife where she finally reunites with her parents, Aunt Jenna and Uncle John.  Post-season 8  The second-to-last episode of The Originals, \\"The Tale of Two Wolves\\", features Elijah and Hope Mikaelson visiting Mystic Falls, where the window of a doctor's office reads \\"Elena Salvatore, MD\\", showing that Elena established her own medical practice. Reception Elena has received mainly positive reviews. Steve West of the Cinema Blend compared the story of The Vampire Diaries and the character of Elena to the popular vampire franchise, Twilight, and its protagonist Bella Swan. West said \\"Clearly Elena is way hotter than Bella, she has two immortal vampires fighting over her\\". After she transitioned into a vampire, Carina Adly MacKenzie of Zap2it hoped that the \\"fierce\\" and \\"ripper\\" side of Elena would emerge when \\"someone messes with the people she loves\\". McKenzie noted that when a person becomes a vampire, \\"their strongest personality traits are heightened\\", and hoped that wouldn't see Elena's \\"compassion and selflessness\\" double into \\"helping old ladies with their groceries and nursing injured animals back to health\\". Robyn Ross of TV Guide also hoped that after Elena \\"has had a taste for blood\\", she would lose control. Prior to her becoming a vampire, Ross thought she was less fun and \\"slightly boring\\", and wanted Elena to follow her instinct and \\"stop protecting everyone's feelings\\". Elena's romances with Stefan and Damon have become a popular craze with viewers, who have nicknamed them \\"Stelena\\" and \\"Delena\\". Andy Swift of the website HollywoodLife praised Elena's relationship with Damon, which was a combination of real love and a sired bond, hoping they would live \\"happily ever after\\". Vlada Gelman of TVLine, however, felt that their romance was \\"over in a rather mature way for a young love triangle\\" and questioned whether Elena was \\"ready to jump into a relationship with Damon right away\\" while Stefan was still in the picture.  Merchandising  Tonner Doll Company, Inc. created dolls for Elena and Katherine along with Stefan and Damon, from 1864.

Retrieved on 2009-9-14 This case set the standards for the United States government to acknowledge the vitality of American Indian water rights, and how rights to the water relate to the continuing survival and self-sufficiency of American Indian people.Thorson, John. (2006). \\"Tribal Water Rights\\", p. 35-36.University of Arizona Press.. Background Water rights thumb|left|Water rights for American Indians go much further than the water itself, as the rights also control where they are allowed to fish. Water rights are extremely important to American Indians, especially those American Indian tribes living in the West, where water supplies are limited. American Indian reservations, and those who live within them, rely on water sources for the water necessary for them to be self- sufficient. American Indian reservations rely on streams and rivers for agricultural purposes. Not only is the water itself important to the American Indian reservations, but also what the water contains. By having the rights to an area of water, one also gains rights to what is in the water. This gives an implied right to fish the waters. Because life relies on water, it may be fair to say that who controls the water ultimately has control over life on the reservation.American Indian Law Review, Vol. 7, No. 1 (1979), pp. 155-169 Published by: University of Oklahoma College of Law Riparian system The Riparian water system is the system controlling water use in the eastern states where water is found to be more plentiful. Under this system the owner of the land bordering the source of water is entitled to use of said water.Canby, William. (2004). \\"American Indian Law\\", p. 426.Thomson West.. This system is sufficient for the states where water is found in abundance, but in the less water rich western states the control of water must be handled differently. Appropriative system In the western part of the country, water ownership is controlled by the appropriative system. This system states that the owner of a piece of land does not automatically own the rights to water found on that land. Rights to water belong to the first user who puts the water to beneficial use. The first people to become appropriators of the water source have the right to continue using the water in the same quantity as always as long as they continue putting the water to good use. This holds true no matter how many other people wish to use the water. The latest water appropriator loses all of their water rights before any water rights are taken from the next latest appropriator.Canby, William. (2004). \\"American Indian Law\\", p. 427.Thomson West.. The Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana, which had been created by the government in 1888, experienced issues with the appropriative water system when water flow to their reservation was being diverted to settlements of non American Indians.Canby, William. (2004). \\"American Indian Law\\", p. 429.Thomson West.. Fort Belknap American Indian Reservation The Fort Belknap Indian Reservation was created in 1888 in Montana. It was created from what had once been a much larger area of land to be set aside for tribes. The 1888 agreement neglected to mention any water rights that were reserved for the reservation in relation to the Milk River. Soon there came a huge demand for water by non-Indian settlers which was an issue for the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation.Shurts, John. (2000). \\"Indian Reserved Water Rights\\", p. 15.University of Oklahoma Press. . As non- Indian settlers began moving closer to the Fort Belknap Reservation, the settlers claimed rights to the water. The settlers did things such as build dams and reservoirs which prevented the reservation from receiving water needed for agricultural purposes. The settlers used the terms of the Appropriative water system to support their actions claiming that they had appropriated the water before the American Indians living on the reservation had put the water to beneficial use. Decision The United States Supreme Court case of Winters v. United States held that the decree enjoining the companies from utilizing river waters intended for an American Indian reservation was affirmed. It was also held that when American Indian reservations were created by the United States government, they were created with the intention of allowing the American Indian settlements to become self- reliant and self-sufficient. As American Indian reservations require water to become self-sufficient in areas such as agriculture, it was found that water rights were reserved for tribes as an implication of the treaties that created the reservations.Thorson, John. (2006). \\"Tribal Water Rights\\", p. 204.University of Arizona Press.. Majority opinion Associate Justice Joseph McKenna delivered the majority opinion. The Supreme Court came to the decision that the Fort Belknap reservation had reserved water rights through the 1888 agreement which created the Fort Belknap American Indian Reservation. It was found unnecessary for the Indians to have to reserve the water rights if they had already reserved the rights to the land for agricultural purposes because the Indians would have no use for the farmland if they could not have access to a water source. It was decided that the water rights of the Milk River were implied when the Fort Belknap American Indian Reservation was created in order to uphold provisions that had been previously stated. The majority opinion was delivered to the United States Supreme Court by associate justice, Joseph McKenna. McKenna wrote that five of the defendants named in the bill failed to answer. He wrote that the other defendants who did answer filed a joint and several answer. From this answer, the case was heard and a decree was entered against all of the defendants. It was determined by the Supreme Court that the reasoning behind the establishment of American Indian reservations was to provide a permanent homeland for the American Indians. The majority opinion found that the decree held.Find Law. \\"WINTERS v. U. S., 207 U.S. 564 (1908)\\" Retrieved on 2009-10-14. The majority opinion was held by Chief Justice Melville W. Fuller and Associate Justices William R. Day, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Joseph McKenna, William H. Moody, Rufus Wheeler Peckham, and Edward D. White.Winters v. United States., 207 U.S. 564 (1908). After the verdict had been reached, the United States government allocated $25,000 to be used for the purpose of extending the irrigation system on the Milk River for use by the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation.Cortelyou, Geo B. Secretary of the Treasury. \\"Letter From Secretary of Treasury to the House of Representatives\\" Retrieved on 2009-10-14. Dissenting opinion Associate justice David J. Brewer dissented from the majority opinion. Implications The Winters court reasoned that water rights were implied in the agreement that had been made with the American Indians in 1888, when the reservation was created. This agreement stated that the Fort Belknap Reservation had been created with the intention of the tribal people being able to become self- sufficient. The court noted that land without water has no value, especially when the purpose of a land was to help a group become self-supporting in the way of agriculture. Therefore, a reservation of water goes along with the reservation of the land. Water rights may be implied from American Indian reservations made by presidential executive order, or American Indian reservations which are created by an act of Congress.Bureau of Land Management. \\"Federal Reserved Water Rights\\". Retrieved on 2009-10-13 Other implications of this court case include setting more of a standard for American Indian water rights along with setting a precedent for later Supreme Court cases which deal with implied water rights. Winters rights Winters rights refers to the reserved water rights cases that followed Winters.Canby, William. (2004). American Indian Law, p. 431. Thomson West. . * First, that they are defined by the federal government and federal law controls them.Thorson, John. (2006). Tribal Water Right, p. 78-79. University of Arizona Press. . * Second, that when an American Indian reservation was established by either a treaty, statute, or executive order, and water rights were not specifically mentioned, a reservation of water rights was implied. These water rights apply to water sources that are either within the reservation or bordering it. * Third, then states that the water rights are reserved as soon as the portion of the reservation cases where competing users of the water source have prior appropriation dates of said water source, they will take precedence over the American Indian rights. Only those with prior appropriation dates take precedence, those with later dates are subordinate to the American Indian reservation in question. In most cases, it is found that American Indian tribes do in general have senior priority dates for quantities of surface water than competing settlements. The amount of water reserved for the use of an American Indian tribe is equal to the amount of water that would sufficiently irrigate all of the irrigable acreage within the reservation. In some cases this part of the Winters rights is extended to include water used not just for agricultural purposes, but for all purposes. For example, a Bureau of Indian Affairs document breaks down what the BIA believes to be the estimated water requirements of all different American Indian reservations, including the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana. This document states that the Fort Belknap reservation will need water for uses such as recreation, wildlife, forestry, energy, minerals, industrial use, domestic use, and agricultural use. These uses are listed in ascending order of the amount of water estimated to be required.Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of Interior, 1978, Report No. 262. It is also said that Winters rights are not lost by an American Indian reservation's lack of use of the water; the rights apply even if the reservation is not using their full portion of water.Canby, William. (2004). American Indian Law, p. 433. Thomson West. . Effects following ruling Although the ruling of Winters v. United States was made very clear, accounts show that water rights relating to American Indian reservations were put aside and neglected for decades after the ruling. While the United States government was caught up in the emergence of non-Indian settlers moving west, the government seemed to turn a blind eye to many non- Indian settlers who were making use of water sources which, under the terms of Winters v. United States, had been reserved for American Indian reservation use. The United States Supreme Court was not called upon to further define American Indian reserved water rights until the case of Arizona v. California in 1963. Related cases Winters v. United States was a United States Supreme Court Case with many implications. One thing that makes this case so monumental is the precedent that is set by it for United States Supreme Court cases that would follow it. Arizona v. California Arizona v. California was a set of 11 United States Supreme Court cases dealing with water rights.\\"American Indian Law Review.\\" LexisNexis. 13 October 2009. These cases took place between the years of 1931 and 2006. The initial question of this case was to determine how much water from the Colorado river Arizona was entitled to. Many western states became involved in the debate over the rights of the water from the Colorado River, and finally the United States government became involved stating that several federal establishments, including five American Indian reservations, had water rights as defined by Winters v. United States.\\"STATE OF ARIZONA v. STATE OF CALIFORNIA, ET AL.\\" LexisNexis. 13 October 2009. This United States Supreme Court case helped to solve a problem found in the case Winters v. United States. While the United States Supreme Court case of Winters v. United States held that American Indian Reservations do have reserved water rights equal to the amount of water needed on the reservation to sufficiently irrigate all of the irrigable reservation acreage, there was always the question of how to decide what amount of water was needed to sufficiently irrigate on the American Indian reservations. Arizona v. California offers the solution of adjudication to help fix this problem.Canby, William. (2004). \\"American Indian Law\\", p. 437.Thomson West.. Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe of Arizona This case dealt with either the United States as trustee or certain American Indian tribes asserting their rights to have certain Indian water rights in Arizona or Montana determined in federal court. The court ruled that all limits that any federal legislation put on state-court jurisdiction over Indian water rights were removed by the McCarran Amendment. This piece of legislation allowed state courts jurisdiction to determine American Indian water rights. This ruling included suits brought by American Indian tribes and pertaining to only American Indian claims. The decision of this case was that the judgment in each of the cases was reversed, and the cases were to be reviewed further.\\"ARIZONA ET AL. v. SAN CARLOS APACHE TRIBE OF ARIZONA ET AL.\\" LexisNexis. 13 October 2009. Nevada v. United States This United States Supreme Court case centered around water rights involving the Truckee River. The defendants in the case were all people who used water from the Truckee River, while the plaintiff was the United States. The defendants argued against American Indian tribal use of the water in the Truckee River stating that the American Indian tribes were not parties to the original cause of action between the United States and the non-American Indian users of the water. The court ruled that the American Indian tribes did have water rights and were allowed to make use of the water in the Truckee River.\\"NEVADA v. UNITED STATES ET AL.\\" LexisNexis. 13 October 2009. United States v. New Mexico The United States claimed to have reserved the use of water out of the Rio Mimbres stream only where necessary to preserve the environment and wildlife. For instance, to care for the timber in the forest or to secure favorable water flows. The United States Supreme Court upheld the ruling made earlier by the Supreme Court of New Mexico. This ruling stated that the United States did not have reserved rights in the Rio Mimbres stream when it came to recreational purposes.\\"UNITED STATES v. NEW MEXICO.\\" LexisNexis. 13 October 2009. Cappaert v. United States Devils Hole cavern in Nevada became a detached part of Death Valley National Monument in 1952, by a proclamation of President Harry S. Truman made under the Antiquities Act. The cavern is home to a rare species of desert fish, the Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). In 1968 the Cappaerts, who were ranchers, were granted an application by the Nevada state engineer to begin using a water supply which took water from Devil's Hole cavern, which lowered water levels in the cavern and endangered the viability of the fish. The federal government sought to place limits on the Cappaerts' use of the water, so as to protect the fish from extinction.Cappaert v. United State, 426 U.S. 128 (1976). The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the United States. The Court held that the implied-reservation-of-water-rights doctrine applies to groundwater as well as surface water. The Court next reaffirmed that \\"Federal water rights are not dependent upon state law or state procedures and they need not be adjudicated only in state courts.\\" Finally, the Court held that when the United States had reserved Devil's Hole in 1952, \\"it acquired by reservation water rights in unappropriated appurtenant water sufficient to maintain the level of the pool to preserve its scientific value\\" (i.e., preserve the fish, which are \\"objects of historic or scientific interest\\" under the American Antiquities Preservation Act). Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States The United States Supreme Court case Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States concerned the abstention doctrine which helped to prevent duplicate litigation between state courts and federal courts.\\"COLORADO RIVER WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICT ET AL. v. UNITED STATES.\\" LexisNexis. 13 October 2009. United States v. Powers This United States Supreme Court case occurred over the argument of tribal water rights, and whether or not the water rights are passed along with the tribal land. When American Indian reservations would sell allotments of land to non-tribe members, those to whom the land was sold would want the same proportion of the reservation's water that the previous American Indian land owner had received. The Supreme Court upheld the earlier ruling that water rights are passed along with the land, meaning that a person who purchases land from an American Indian reservation also purchases an allotment of the water source used on the reservation.\\"UNITED STATES v.

These cakes would have been eaten by the cattle, which would then be consumed by the civilian population, causing the deaths of millions of German citizens. Furthermore, it would have wiped out the majority of Germany's cattle, creating a massive food shortage for the rest of the population that remained uninfected. Preparations were not complete until early 1944. Operation Vegetarian was only to be used in the event of a German anthrax attack on the United Kingdom.Changing Direction: British Military Planning for Post-war Strategic Defence, 1942-47 by Julian Lewis The cakes themselves were tested on Gruinard Island, just off the coast of Scotland. Because of the widespread contamination from the anthrax spores, the land remained quarantined until 1990. The five million cakes made to be disseminated in Germany were eventually destroyed in an incinerator shortly after the end of World War II. In his novel The Impossible Dead (2011), author Ian Rankin mentions the clandestine events surrounding the removal of contaminated soils from Guinard Island by a protest group, the Dark Harvest Commando, and the island's removal from maps by the British Government. The island also features as the principal setting for the 1985 novel El a√±o de Gracia, by Cristina Fern√°ndez Cubas, in which the protagonist spends a winter shipwrecked on the island.

Pentax K-x uses an Exmor, Sony-made sensor (different from the back-lit Exmor-R used in other Sony models).http://www.sulit.com.ph/index.php/view+classifieds/id/2177950/ In some cases it even approaches the quality produced by full-frame DSLRs like the Nikon D700 and the Canon 5DMkII, both with larger sensors. The Pentax K-x is suitable for low light conditions for both still and video photography.Pentax K-x - Unbiased digital camera reviews, prices, and advice http://www.digitalcamera-hq.com/products/pentax-k-xPentax and Sony DSLR Face- Off: http://www.tomsguide.com/us/DSLR-Pentax-Sony,review-1467.html The K-x is a compact model above the entry-level K2000/K-m. It is lighter than other Pentax DSLRs, including the K2000, and lacks the weather sealing of the K10D, K200D, K20D, and K-7, and is intended to be sold with lightweight DA-L-series lenses. It offers some improvements over the high-end K-7, including a maximum sensitivity of ISO 12800 with lower noise than comparable cameras and even than some of higher class, a maximum shutter speed improved to 1/6000 s, and a faster burst mode of 4.7 frame/s. DPReview.com has observed that the K-x offers many of the same features as the K-7 features in what is essentially the same body as the K2000 The K-x also offers a large range of body colors compared to the traditional black DSLR body. In Japan, up to 100 color combinations are available.http://www.radiantlite.com/2009/09/pentax-k-x-vs- competitors.html The Pentax K-x won the Technical Image Press Association (TIPA) award for Best DSLR Entry Level in Europe 2010http://currentphotographer.com/pentax-k-x-wins-tipa-award-for-best-entry- level-dslr/ and Time Magazine listed the Pentax K-x in its Best Travel Gadgets of 2009 list.Time Magazine - The Pentax K-x is often sold packaged with the DA-L 18-55mm 3.5-5.6 kit lens. Other features: *Live preview *HD 720p video at 24 frame/s *In-body stabilization *HDR(High Dynamic Range) Image Capture. The K-x was discontinued in March, 2011, shortly after the Pentax K-r was introduced. Also introduced at a similar pricepoint was the mirrorless Pentax K-01.  In-body stabilization  The built in Shake Reduction function automatically turns off in the following situations. * Self-Timer * Remote control shooting * Bulb shooting * HDR Capture  High dynamic range imaging (HDR)  HDR takes 3 frames of different exposure and combines them into a single jpeg image while turning off the shake reduction. This essentially means tripod only shots in most cases while trying to minimize any movement. Self Timer would be the ideal method but unfortunately the Pentax K-x HDR feature cannot be used with the camera's selftimer as it is not enabled in Firmware 1.01 and 1.02 for reasons unknown. This lack of Timer \\"drive mode\\" can be compensated for with a Pentax IR Remote and Remote \\"drive mode\\" selection.  AA battery life  There are many reports that using 4xAA rechargeable Sanyo Eneloops will give ~500-1000 photos on a single charge with firmware 1.01 depending on usage. In a DPReview test of different AA batteries:http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/pentaxkx/13 * Lithium took 1900 photos and 1100 with 50% flash * Ni-MH 1900mAh took 640 photos and 420 with 50% flash * Alkaline took 210 photos and 130 with 50% flash The biggest effect on battery life is using LiveView and Video.  RAW formats  The camera can shoot RAW images using either the Pentax PEF format or the open standard Adobe Digital negative (DNG). Shooting RAW and a JPEG at the same time is also possible.  Video function  The camera is capable of recording HD Video files which made it quite popular for some independent filmmakers. The camera is using the \\"DV codec alike\\" MJPEG codec, which is a very soft compression that creates relatively huge video files but on the other hand allows editing of this video files even on older editing systems with less CPU power. The advantage of this compression method is that it saves every single frame as a progressive frame and is (compared to AVCHD) not only saving the changes inside the group of pictures. Videos can be recorded either in HD (1280x720p) or SD (640x416), both with 24 frame/s. They are stored as AVI files. The sound of the videos are all uncompressed PCM 32 kHz, 16 bit. If sound is not needed for video recordings, it can be deactivated and silent videos can be recorded. There are some limitations for the length of a single video. At the very least, there is a limitation on the file size for each video file, which is 4 GB (the maximum file size that is allowed by the FAT32 format of the SDHC cards). But it is possible that a video will not reach 4 GB because it will be limited by excessive sensor heat (usually after 12 minutes of continuous video shooting). Depleted batteries or a full memory card may also interfere with video length.  Firmware  The Pentax K-x Firmware updates have added functionality and fixed a few issues.http://www.ricoh- imaging.co.jp/english/support/digital/k-x_s.html * Improved reliability of recording operation when using SDXC memory card. (v 1.03) * Compatible with SDXC memory card. (v 1.02) * Added three kinds of particular effect shooting function (Pre-set 1,2 and 3) on [Cross Processing].

Rubblization is a construction and engineering technique that involves saving time and transportation costs by reducing existing concrete into rubble at its current location rather than hauling it to another location. Rubblization has two primary applications: creating a base for new roadways and decommissioning nuclear power plants. Road Construction In road construction, a worn-out Portland cement concrete can be rubblized and then overlaid with a new surface, usually asphalt concrete. Specialized equipment breaks up the old roadway into small pieces to make a base for new pavement. This saves the expense of transporting the old pavement to a disposal site, and purchasing/transporting new base materials for the replacement paving. The result is a smoother pavement surface than would be obtained if a layer of asphalt were to be applied to the unbroken concrete surface. The technique has been used on roads since the late 1990s, and is also being used for concrete airport runways. The rubblizing process provides many benefits versus other methods of road rehabilitation, such as crack and seat or removal and replacement of a concrete surface including: rubblizing a concrete surface is 52% less expensive than remove and replacing concrete; rubblizing reduces road reconstruction time, from days of lane closures to hours, providing large savings to contractors and reduced impact on travelling public; and rubblization is an environmentally friendly \\"green\\" process., Nuclear Power Plants In nuclear energy regulation, \\"Rubblization\\" refers to a method for decommissioning a nuclear power plant. As with other decommissioning techniques, all equipment from buildings is removed and the surfaces are decontaminated. The difference with rubblization is that above-grade structures, including the concrete containment building, are demolished into rubble and buried in the structure's foundation below ground. The site surface is then covered, regraded, and landscaped for unrestricted use. This saves the expense of removing and transporting the building pieces to a different site.

Biography He was born in Crawfordjohn, Lanarkshire, Scotland, the son of James and Elisabeth Grossart. Grossart joined the Royal Flying Corps in late 1917 as a cadet, being appointed a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 17 November, and was confirmed in his rank on 25 February 1918. On 1 April, the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged to form the Royal Air Force, and so Grossart was assigned to No. 205 Squadron RAF to fly the DH.4 two-seater day bomber. On 3 May he shared credit with nine other aircraft of his squadron in the shooting down of two Pfalz D.IIIs over Chaulnes, and on 15 May he drove down another D.III in the same area. He gained another credit, shared with seven others, on 20 May, accounting for another D.III over Mericombe. Finally, on 11 August, he destroyed another D.III over P√©ronne. On 23 August he was appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain. He award of the Distinguished Flying Cross was gazetted on 20 September 1918. His citation read: :Lieutenant William Grossart. ::During the last two and a half months this officer has carried out twenty-seven successful bombing raids and twenty-five special photographic reconnaissances, his services on the latter duty being exceptionally valuable. This officer possesses a fine spirit of determination; neither strong opposition nor adverse weather conditions deters him from achieving his object. Grossart left the RAF after the war, being transferred to the unemployed list on 12 April 1919.

School enrollment is 450 students. The campus overlooks the Pasadena Rose Bowl and the Arroyo Seco.Private Independent Schools, Bunting and Lyon, Inc., 2009, Wallingford, CT. p. 13, History In 1950, Thomas and Catherine Chandler founded the Chandler School in Altadena with an initial enrollment of 14 students in grades four through eight. After eight years, the school outgrew the original Altadena campus, and with the help of 40 parents, a down payment was raised to purchase the present Armada Drive property. Construction was completed one room at a time with donated materials and labor. A Board of Trustees was formed and Chandler became a 501(c) 3 non-profit institution. The site at 1005 Armada Drive welcomed students for classes on September 20, 1958, with just two buildings and an athletic field. After this, the school continued to expand ‚Äì the first kindergarten class enrolled in 1963. Construction on the original South Campus began in 1970 and was completed in 1972. In 1976, when founder Thomas Chandler retired, Arthur L.P. Brown became Chandler School's second Head of School. By 1979, 366 students were being instructed in kindergarten through eighth grade. That same year, Jefferson C. Stephens, Jr. became Chandler's third Head of School. The gymnasium-multipurpose building was added in 1981. Thomas A. Chandler died in 1996, but his wife Catherine remains active in the school community. In 1998, the Pasadena Planning Commission approved Chandler's 10-year Master Plan and the Chandler 2000 Lower School Project. Construction on the new project began in 2000 and was completed in 2001 ‚Äì the same year John Finch became Chandler's fourth Head of School. Chandler welcomed 450 students, the largest enrollment in school history, to its new South Campus in the fall of 2011, featuring a Middle School classroom building, a renovated gym, and outdoor sports court.\\"Chandler Celebrates Largest Enrollment in School's History\\" Pasadena Outlook Sept. 1, 2011,  Technology  Chandler instituted an integrated technology curriculum in 2005 requiring each Middle School student to bring a personal laptop to school every day. This allows for technology education to be part of the regular curriculum, instead of an independent component, better reflecting recent trends in higher education and professional technology usage.  STEAM Curriculum  Chandler adopted a STEAM curriculum in 2013, providing an opportunity for each grade level to work on a project that synthesizes science, technology, engineering, art, and math. Chandler hosts a STEAM Night during which all nine grades present the results of their year-long STEAM projects. Projects have included a miniature golf course and a city made of boxes displayed on an outdoor sport court.* \\"STEAM at Chandler\\", \\"Shamrock\\", Spring 2013  Athletics  The school's founder, Thomas Chandler, graduated from the Webb School with letters in football, tennis and track.

The recent HPSS systems use high-powered electronic speakers, which can be independently arranged to provide directional or omnidirectional coverage, depending on installation. The HPSS16 provides up to 1600 watts of continuous power to drive up to four 400-watt speaker units, whereas the larger 3200-watt HPSS32 can drive up to eight 400-watt speakers. Like other electronic outdoor warning systems (such as Federal Signal's Modulator, for example), they can also be used as public announcement (PA) systems, and can play a number of programmed tones. Options include solar-powered operation and pre-recorded voice messages. Sometimes these high-powered speakers play the Westminster Chime.

More recent HPSS units use a lower-pitched 575 Hz tone which has given adequate results. In San Francisco, many of their HPSS units have the tones of a Federal Signal STL-10 siren, which was one of the sirens used by San Francisco until the whole siren system was replaced with HPSS systems. While this added voice capability to San Francisco's warning network, it has also caused some reliability problems as the comparatively deep-pitched growl of these tones can damage the speakers when playing at high volume. However, this may not necessarily be the fault of the speakers used, as few electronic speakers can tolerate playing such low-pitched, bass-rich sounds at high volume levels for extended periods of time.

The famous road carried travelers across much of the country from the day it was commissioned on November 11, 1926 through June 25, 1985 when it was decommissioned. Historical background Since its construction, most motorists preferred to travel that way because the weather tended to be more hospitable than along the more northerly highways. Businesses and entire towns sprang up to cater to the ever-increasing traffic. Although it brought considerable prosperity, the thoroughfare also spawned bumper-to-bumper congestion in the communities and numerous accidents on the rural stretches leading to the gruesome nickname, ‚ÄúBloody 66‚Äù. Just as it seemed the mostly two lane road could not handle another vehicle, on June 29, 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the Interstate Highway Act into law, which allocated $25 billion for the construction of of interstate highways. Over the next 29 years, section after section of Route 66 was methodically bypassed by multi- lane, high speed expressways enabling motorists to increase their speeds and avoid hazardous congestion. This was a time-saving advantage to those on the move, but a distinct disadvantage to businesses and communities along the Route. Where customers once thronged, they rarely showed up at all, anymore. Inspiring the Federation By 1994, Route 66 was well on its way to becoming little more than miles of memories. Unaware of these declining conditions, in August of that year, David and Mary Lou Knudson set out to relive their early experiences along the legendary road. Mary Lou remembered traveling it during World War II with her parents as her father, a U.S. Air Force Sergeant, drove between several bases in Illinois and California. David remembered the trip he made in 1963 to move from Detroit to Los Angeles as being like a ‚Äú2,400 mile carnival‚Äù. But this time, they couldn‚Äôt even find the famous byway. They soon discovered it was no longer a U.S. Highway and was not on their map as ‚ÄúUS 66‚Äù. So the Knudsons stopped at a truck stop west of Chicago to ask where it was, and the clerk sold them the ‚ÄúHere It Is‚Äù map set which guided them to and along the original road. The moment they got on what was once Route 66, the Knudsons realized that something was very wrong. The once colorful and often gaudy trading posts, side shows, rare animal displays, motels and caf√©s were gone. In their place was mile after mile of roadside that was little more than boarded up buildings. Many stretches of roadbed were poorly maintained or completely closed to traffic. Entire towns that were once bustling tourist meccas were all but shut down. They were saddened by the deterioration of such an important American icon; so much so, they decided to do something about it. As they traveled, they photographed many of the buildings and tape recorded captions for each of their locations. They had planned to take a week to travel to their home in Los Angeles but that turned into 3 weeks. They arrived home laden with hundreds of photos and several tapes of captions. On the trip, David decided to sell the shares in his business and commit his time to developing a nonprofit corporation that would work to save Route 66. Establishing the federation To that end, the Knudson‚Äôs first step was to contact the gentleman who had prepared the Route 66 map set they had used to cross the country. He directed them to the National Park Service office in Santa Fe where they had prepared a study of the Route for Senators Pete Domenici (R) and Jeff Bingaman (D). Between the Knudsons, the Senators and New Mexico Congresswoman Heather Wilson (R) a Congressional Bill was drafted that would help fund the restoration of the famous highway. In 1999, the \\"National Route 66 Preservation Bill\\" was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. The act provides $10 million in matching fund grants to individuals, corporations and communities for the purpose of preserving or restoring historic properties along Route. To this day, David Knudson sits on the grant committee. Acquiring the funds for restoration through the Bill was the first tangible step toward the renaissance. Although restoration dollars were essential to the Knudson‚Äôs plans and hopes, bringing in tourists to patronize the businesses was every bit as important. This is where David‚Äôs advertising and publicity background came into play. He launched a worldwide campaign to turn the Route into a tourist destination. To this day, it is estimated that 40% of the business the Route generates comes from countries other than the U. S. The John Steinbeck Awards Then came the Federation‚Äôs John Steinbeck Awards evenings. The purpose of these events was threefold: #Present the ‚ÄúJohn Steinbeck Award‚Äù to an individual who had contributed significantly to the preservation of Route 66. #Bring Route 66 historians, authors, artists, photographers, business people and enthusiasts together to network and meet to discuss what could be done to preserve the road. #Introduce these people to various Route 66 communities and conversely, familiarize citizens within these host communities with the importance of the Route. The first John Steinbeck Awards Evening was scheduled for May, 1995 in Oklahoma City. The bombing of the Murrah building on April 19 put an end to those plans. The Federation suffered significant financial loss as a result, and it was not until October 1998 that a John Steinbeck Awards Evening took place; this time in Kingman, Arizona. From that year on, the evenings were produced annually in one Route 66 community after another until the last one in San Bernardino, California in September 2005. By that time, Route 66 communities were vying to have the evenings and they would build three-day, communitywide Route 66 celebrations around them. Shortly after that last event, Mary Lou Knudson suffered a debilitating stroke and died three years later. She had been the one who managed the myriad of details involved in producing the large events. Promoting Route 66 As the popularity of Route 66 grew around the world, an increasing number of tourists began driving the road and enjoying its history and sights, however most of them were not enjoying the vintage dining and lodging establishments that were so much the essence of early roadside Americana. The majority of travelers were staying in and eating in chain establishments that were familiar to them. The Knudsons had become acquainted with many of the owners of the vintage businesses and knew that most of their facilities were at least as clean and as well run as the chains. They were also usually much less expensive. In order to introduce the public to the family-owned, vintage enterprises, the first ‚ÄúRoute 66 Dining & Lodging Guide‚Äù was published in 1999. It was, and still is prepared from reviews conducted by the ‚ÄúAdopt-A-Hundred‚Äù adopters. The Federation‚Äôs ‚ÄúAdopt-A-Hundred‚Äù Program was initially developed to keep an eye on possible preservation problems along the Route such as a bridge, a business or a stretch of roadbed being closed. Adopters canvassed their sections once a year watching for preservation trouble. So, the adopters were asked to review the dining and lodging businesses while they traveled their sections. The current edition is the 14th and includes over 500 mostly vintage businesses. Map guide With the intent of making it as easy as possible for travelers to find the most popular alignments, the Federation commissioned Route 66 artist, historian and cartographer, Jerry McClanahan to produce a map guide. The product, introduced in 2005, was the 200 page, spiral bound EZ66 GUIDE For Travelers. It is now in its 3rd edition.

Founded in 1992, NICHE has evolved into a national geriatric nursing program comprising over 620 hospitals in more than 40 states as well as parts of Canada. Unlike similar programs, NICHE does not prescribe how institutions should modify geriatric care; rather, it provides the materials and services necessary to stimulate a change in the culture of healthcare facilities to achieve patient-centered care for older adults.  History  NICHE is based on 1981 Geriatric Resource Nurse (GRN) model, in which unit-based GRN nurses provided consultation to other staff nurses leading improved care of older adults by creating standard protocols for common geriatric problems and enhancing the expertise of staff nurses. Initially a part of the Hartford Foundation's Hospital Outcomes Program for the Elderly (HOPE) multi-site initiative, after a series of funds for the project, the NICHE program was officially created in 1992. Through a rigorous screening-process using the Geriatric Institutional Assessment Profile (GIAP), an instrument designed to help hospitals analyze the needs of their elderly patients and determine gaps in geriatric care provision, the NICHE Program has become an integral part of the Hartford Institute since 1996. In 2006, Hartford Institute received funding from Atlantic Philanthropies to develop a business plan to expand its organizational capacity, improve dramatically the program's \\"toolkit\\"‚Äîparticularly its measurement and reporting capacity‚Äîand initiate outreach to accelerate adoption of this program by additional hospitals.  The NICHE Program  The NICHE Program provides the principles, resources and tools to stimulate a change in the culture of health care facilities and achieve patient-centered care for older adult patients. It is affordable and comprehensive, and benefits hospitals in a number of ways: * Improved clinical outcomes * Positive fiscal results * Enhanced nursing competencies * Community recognition * Greater patient, family, and staff satisfaction NICHE provides hospitals with: * State-of-the-art training, tools and resources including an interactive 24/7 E-learning center * Project management support/mentoring for NICHE-based hospital initiatives * Evidence-based clinical protocols that address \\"never events,\\" Joint Commission compliance and other regulatory imperatives * Geriatric Institutional Assessment Profile (GIAP) tool * Shared information, knowledge, and expertise  References  # Fulmer, T.

He was one of the important leaders of the Ethiopian Empire's forces during the 19th century. Described by Haggai Erlich as the greatest leader whom Abyssinia produced since the death of Emperor Tewodros II in 1868,From the back cover of Haggai Erlich's biography, Haggai Erlich, Ras Alula and the Scramble for Africa: A Political Biography: Ethiopia & Eritrea 1875‚Äì1897 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1996) Ras Alula was referred to by Europeans as \\"the Garibaldi of Abyssinia\\".Augustus B. Wylde, Modern Abyssinia (London: Methuen, 1901), p. 29 He led many battles for the independence of Ethiopia, including Dogali and Adwa. In service of the Emperor Yohannes IV, Ras Allula successfully defeated the Egyptians in Gundet 1875, Gura 1876, Aylet 1887, Senhit 1880, against the mahdists of Sudan, Kufit 1885, Metema 1889 against Italians, Sahati 1887, Dogali 1887, Amba-Alaje 1889, Mekelle 1896 and Adwa 1896. When Yohannes returned from his unsuccessful campaign in Saati, he invaded and ravaged Gojjam for King Tekle Haymanot Tessema's rebellious intentions.  Early years  Alula was born in Mennewe, a village in Tembien, the son of Engda Eqube, a farmer of modest origins. Haggai Erlich relates a story about Alula's childhood ‚Äì \\"well known throughout Tigray\\": a group of people carrying baskets of bread to a wedding ceremony were stopped by a group of children led by the future Ras, who demanded to know where they were going. \\"To the Castle of Ras Alula Wadi Qubi,\\" they mockingly replied. \\"Thereafter,\\" concludes Erlich, \\"his friends and the people of Mannawe nicknamed him Ras Alula.\\"Haggai Erlich, Ras Alula and the Scramble for Africa: A Political Biography: Ethiopia & Eritrea 1875‚Äì1897 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1996), p. 5 Erlich states the year of his birth as 1847. The house of Ras Alula at Asmara, in present-day Eritrea At first Alula attached himself to the distinguished Ras Araya Dimtsu, hereditary chief of Enderta who was lord of the land his father farmed; before long he gained the attention of Ras Araya's successful nephew, Dejazmach Kassa Mercha (the future emperor Yohannes IV), who made him his elfegn kalkay (\\"chamberlain and doorkeeper\\"). Erlich records an oral tradition that the young Alula distinguished himself by being the one who captured king Tekle Giyorgis in the battle where Emperor Yohannes crushed his opponent (11 July 1871).Erlich, Ras Alula, p. 9 In spite of his humble background, Alula succeeded in climbing the ladder of the feudal hierarchy. He had three children by his first wife Woizero B'tweta. However, in order to enhance his position at the Imperial court, he divorced his wife and married Woizero Amlesu Araya, daughter of Ras Araya Dimtsu, the powerful and much respected uncle of Emperor Yohannes IV. His second marriage was purely for political reasons, to improve his legitimacy with the local aristocracy, who did not hide their disapproval at seeing the son of a peasant reach this stature. Alula demonstrated his military skill in the Battle of Gundet and Gura, which were fought in November 1875 and March 1876 respectively, where he routed the Egyptian forces. Emperor Yohannes badly needed a man with these skills at the moment, for Ras Woldemichael Solomon was in revolt in Hamasien; Alula was promoted to Ras and sent to deal with this unruly aristocrat, who fled to Bogos. On 9 October 1876, the Emperor Yohannes IV made Alula governor of Mereb Mellash and Midri Bahri (today part of Eritrea).Erlich, Ras Alula, p. 13  Battle of Kufit  In the Hewett Treaty, concluded in 1884, the United Kingdom recognized Bogos and Massawa as possessions of Ethiopia in return for Ras Alula's help evacuating the Egyptian garrisons of Amedeb, Algeden, Keren, Ghirra, and Gallabat which had been isolated by the Mahdists, and because of these successes the British once more asked for his help against the Mahdists under Osman Digna.Wylde, Modern Abyssinia, pp. 35ff Ras Alula prepared for his campaign against the Mahdists, despite the opposition of certain local leaders who did not accept his rule. Nevertheless, Alula advanced into the territory of the Bogos, then entered Keren in September 1885, where he stayed for ten days, then marched on Kufit. At Kufit, Osman Digna's forces were annihilated, but the Ethiopians also suffered significant losses: the commanders Blatta Gebru and Aselafi Hagos were killed, and Ras Alula himself was wounded.  Battle of Dogali  Ras Alula Engida in his final days. However events beyond Tigray or the Horn of Africa gave Ras Alula very little time to recover from the battle. As part the European Scramble for Africa, at this time the Italians took control of the Red Sea coasts, occupying Massawa and Sahatit with the tacit approval of the British, which was a violation of the Hewett Treaty. Although he had collaborated with the British against the Mahdists, Ras Alula chief interest was to guarantee Ethiopian sovereignty, which made him very wary towards the English who he suspected supported the Italians' encroachments. His mistrust is clearly expressed in a conversation carried out with Augustus B. Wylde, the former British vice consul at Jeddah, who recorded these words in a dispatch to the Manchester Guardian: Battle of Dogali in 1887 Upon returning to Asmara, Alula mobilized 5,000 men and marched from Ghinda towards Sahati. It is unclear whether Ras Alula was acting on his own initiative in this instance, or at the orders of his Emperor. Discussing the battle later, he insisted that he was following orders; contemporary Ethiopian documents support Ras Alula's claim. However, in a 9 March 1887 letter to Queen Victoria, Emperor Yohannes wrote that his general had first spent two weeks investigating the Italian presence, then demanded that the Italians either evacuate their positions outside of Massawa or fight.Erlich, Ras Alula, pp. 105f Before attacking the Italians, he notified Emperor Yohannes of his intentions, which is expressed to Harrison, who had accompanied the admiral Hewett during the negotiations of the treaty, declaring to him that the British had not honored their word. To Marcopolo Bey Ras Alula wrote that the Italians were in Massawa, and to the Consul Sumagn de France, he warned that he would destroy the Italian forces if they did not leave Abassinian territory. But the Italians believed that it was \\"the divine will that the Italians come to Massawa\\". In October 1886, the forces of Alula appeared near Sahati and Massawa. By December 1886, confrontation with the Italians was inevitable. The first clash took place 25 January 1887 at Sahati, where the Ethiopians were repulsed with heavy casualties; Alula rallied his troops and the next day annihilated the Italian relief column at Dogali. The commander of the Italian forces, colonel Tommaso De Cristoforis was killed in this battle, along with 400 soldiers and 22 officers.  Battle of Gallabat  By 1888 the Sudanese Italians and dervishes were ready to renew their attacks. In March 1889, the Battle of Gallabat (also known as the Battle of Metemma) was fought on the western Ethiopian border. Here the Emperor Yohannes was wounded and killed, and his head taken by the Mahdists as a trophy, despite the Ethiopians almost carrying the day. Emperor Yohannes' death led to a period of political turmoil in Ethiopia. Although Yohannes on his deathbed had named his son Ras Mengesha as his heir, and begged Ras Alula and his other nobles to support him, within a matter of weeks Menelik II was recognized throughout Ethiopia as the new emperor.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 162 Meanwhile, Ras Alula found himself isolated, his patron dead, and the steady Italian advance from the coast having deprived him of his power base beyond the Mareb River. Menelik II of Shewa was crowned emperor only a few months after the battle. The Italian Count Pietro Antonelli, who represented his country in Ethiopia, hastened to Wuchale where he negotiated a treaty with Menelik, which gave official Ethiopia recognition to Italian possession of all of the land the Italians occupied. A few months later, they used this treaty to declare Eritrea their African colony.  Battle of Adwa  Adwa today. Following the Treaty of Wuchale, the Italians continued to extend to the west not only around Teseney and Agordat, but also around Adwa. Unknown to Emperor Menelik, the Italian version of the treaty had language making Ethiopia a protectorate of Italy, and the Italian actions were in preparation for its enforcement on his empire and making it a colony. When Emperor Menelik learned of this treachery, he renounced the treaty which led to the First Italo-Abyssinian War, and as the bitter news spreads through Ethiopia the major nobility and military figures, including Ras Alula, unanimously joined him. The conflict has its climax at the Battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896. In this battle, Alula was on the left side of the Ethiopian positions, on the heights of Adi Abune, supported by Ras Makonnen, and Ras Mikael. The forces of Ras Sebhat and Dejazmach Hagos Tafari likewise joined Ras Alula and Ras Mengesha. Augustus Wylde, a contemporary of the events, described Ras Alula's invaluable contribution to this critical battle: During the battle itself, Ras Alula was assigned to watch the Gasgorie Pass and block the arrival of Italian reinforcements coming from Adi Quala.Wylde, Modern Abyssinia, pp. 209f Death Ras Alula could not rest after this victory; less than a year later, on 15 January 1897, he fought against an old rival, Ras Hagos of Tembien. Although Ras Alula was victorious and Ras Hagos killed, Ras Alula suffered a gunshot wound in the leg, and died on 15 February.Erlich, Ras Alula, p. 196  Legacy  Ras Alula holds a special place in Ethiopian history as the greatest military mind the country has ever produced. The airport in Mek'ele is named after Ras Alula, and an equestrian statue is dedicated to him in that city. A hotel in Axum also bears his name. Ethiopian scholar Richard Pankhurst named his son, Dr. Alula Pankhurst, after Ras Alula.

Areas from their demographics and economy to health standards, drug and alcohol use, and land use and ownership all lead to a better understanding of Native American life. Health standards for Native Americans have notable disparities from that of all United States racial and ethnic groups. They have higher rates of disease, higher death rates, and a lack of medical coverage. These health issues are matched by illegal drug abuse; abuse levels are higher than any other demographic group in the United States. Methamphetamine abuse on reservations is a particular area of concern for tribal and federal governments. *SITE CLOSED*see justice.gov's archive General demographics Native American population demographics are studied by the federal government in conjunction with the Native Alaskan population. According to 2008 US Census projections, those who are Native American and Alaska Natives alone number 3.08 million of the total US population of 304 million, or 1.01 percent of the nation's entire population. Those who are Native American alone or in combination with other races measure as 4.86 million individuals, or 1.60 percent of the nation's entire population. The Native population continues to grow yearly. The Census Bureau projects that American Indian and Alaska Natives will reach 5 million individuals by 2065. At the present time there are 566 federally recognized tribes. The population of Native Americans however extends beyond those with this federal recognition. Certain tribes have much larger population bases than others. The United States Census has documented 1.93 million individuals that are American Indian or Alaskan Native alone (not in combination with other races) with specified tribes. The tribe with the largest population base, for 2008, was the tribe of Navajo people with 307,555 individuals. The Cherokee tribe had the second largest population, with 262,224 individuals. Follow in third and fourth are the Sioux tribe and Chippewa tribe with 114,047 individuals and 107,322 individuals, respectively. The remainder of the Native American tribes have populations below one hundred thousand. This does not account for those who do not have specified tribes or are of multiple races. The distribution of age of Native Americans and Alaskan Natives differs from the general population of the United States, according to 2008 Census data. Of those who are strictly Native American or Alaskan Native, 28.3% are below the age of 18. 64.3% are between 18 and 64 years of age, while the remaining 7.4% are 65 years of age and older. This is a notably younger population than the overall population. The median age of Native Americans and Alaskan Native is 31.2, while the male median age is 30.0 and female median age is 32.8. Native Americans and Alaskan Natives also differ in their household composition. Of the 795,764 documented households 68.5% are family households with the remaining 31.5% non family households. The 545,403 family households are divided between married-couple families, male-headed households, and female- headed households. Over half, 58.9% specifically, are married-couple families. Male-headed households are 10.8% of family households, while female-headed households are 30.3% of family households. Alternatively, non family households are constituted of those living alone and householders living with non family. Of the 250,361 non family households, 80.0% are living alone and 20.0% are non family not living alone. Economy and social status The United States is home to 3.1 million Native Americans. In comparison to the rest of the population, this number is a very small amount (only .9%). American Indians have historically lived in extreme poverty. With the rise of Indian gaming enterprises, the problem of poverty may have been variously addressed in select areas. Yet, while Native Americans have begun to take more control of their tribal economies, poverty on Indian Reservations is still a major issue. The U.S. Census in both 1990 and 2000 indicates that poverty has prevailed on reservations; to this day, Native Americans have the highest poverty and unemployment rates in the United States. The poverty rate of Native Americans is 25%. Incomes of Native Americans tend to be low, and unemployment rates are usually high. For example, the unemployment rate on the Blackfoot Reservation in Montana has been 69%. This is in comparison to the American national unemployment rate of 6.7% , or even during the worst part of the Great Depression at 25%. According to the 2000 Census, Indians living in Indian country have incomes that are less than half of the general U.S. population.Duthu, N. Bruce. American Indians and the Law. New York: Penguin Group, 2008. Print. Page 118. The U.S. Census reports that the median income of households based on a three-year average from 2003-2005 was $33,627. In 1989, the median income of Native American households was $19,900. Average income varies by tribe and can range from $29,211 in the Osage tribe, to a mere $11,402 in the Tohono O‚Äôodham tribe. Over 20% of Native American reservation households make less than $5,000 annually while only 6% of the overall US population has an annual income of less than $5,000. The average Native American family (3.41) is larger than the American national average, yet only 30% have health insurance. The quality of life for many Native Americans are often comparable to that of developing nations. However, Indian tribes are becoming more economically independent in recent years. The impact of Native American gaming has been monumental, but non-gaming tribes have growing economies as well. For example, the Mississippi Choctaw Indians have incorporated industry into their economy. Automobile subassembly and plastic manufacturing are only two of the sectors in which the tribe is involved. Factories seem to contradict Indian culture, but ironically, industry helps culture thrive. By embracing industry, the Choctaw have been able to build a stable enough economy to prevent people from leaving the reservation and encourage people to come back, according to Chief Phillip Martin. Life on the tribe is more appealing because it is more secure. Jobs are readily available, and the tribe has revitalized public health, housing, and education.Harvard. The State of the Native Nations. New York: Oxford UP, 2008. Print. Past federal policies have continually been detrimental to tribal economies,Duthu, N. Bruce. American Indians and the Law. New York: Penguin Group, 2008. Print. but self-determination has provided tribes with the independence and sovereignty to combat a history of poverty. According to the US Census, real per capita income has grown substantially in past decades. In 1970, the average real per capita income among Reservation Indians was $4,347. This figure grew to $6,510 in 1980, dipped to $5,959 in 1990, and grew again to $7,942 in 2000. However, the overall statistic for the United States has also steadily grown over this span of time. The total US real per capita was $13,188 in 1970 and $21,587. While economy on Reservations has improved, it is still significantly lower than that of the United States. The tribe with the lowest per capita income on a non-gaming Reservation is the Crow Creek Reservation in South Dakota with $4,043, but it also has a very low population of 1,846. The tribe with the highest per capita income on a non-gaming Reservation is the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation in New York. With a population of 2,581 , it averages $12,016 per year. The least successful gaming Reservation has a higher per capita income than the Crow Creek Reservation: The Texas Kickapoo Reservation, population of 423, has an average of $3,398. The most successful gaming tribe is the Viejas Reservation in California; its population is 232 and averages $28,128 per capita income. Therefore, population is insignificant when determining economic success. A better measure is geographic location. Further breakdown of poverty rates show that Native Americans are consistently the highest among each race. Reservation Indians have a 39% poverty rate; Non-Reservations, 26%; Black, 25%, Hispanic/Latino of all races, 23%, Pacific Islander, 18%, Asian, 13%; and White, 9%. Location and lands This map shows the population concentration of Native Americans and Alaskan Natives in 2008 by state, with darker shades of green indicating greater concentration. The Native American population is not evenly spread across the nation. The greatest proportion live in the western regions of the United States, specifically 43%. The remainder live in the south, 31%, the midwest, 17%, and the northeast, 9%. This statistic demonstrates how the Native American population is concentrated into few general areas. This is further proven by the fact that over half of Native Americans live within ten states. In 2000, the states with the largest Native American populations were California, Oklahoma, Arizona, Texas and New Mexico. Twenty-one states have Native American populations which constitute less than 1% over their overall population, including states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and West Virginia. Native Americans live in every different location, from reservations and rural areas to major urban centers. Reservations administered by the United States constitute about of land. This is broken into about 326 areas, ranging greatly in size from millions of acres to slightly over . In addition to these federal reservations, there are allotted lands, lands under restricted status, and state Indian reservations. The land- owning segment of the Native American population continues to increase, which in the later 1900s nearly doubled each decade.Olson, James Stuart. Native Americans in the twentieth century. Provo, Utah: Brigham Young UP, 1984. Print. Private property owners include those who live in cities or urban centers. The two specific places with the largest Native American populations are the Los Angeles-Long Beach area, followed by New York City; each are home to over 50,000 Native Americans. Other large concentrations of urban Native Americans include Phoenix, Arizona and Anchorage, Alaska.Waldman, Carl. Atlas of the North American Indian. 3rd ed. New York: Checkmark Books, 2009. Print. Health standards Native Americans require medical care and have health concerns similar to many other United States demographics. From all ages of American Indians or Alaska Natives, approximately 12% were found to be in fair or poor health in 2005. There are known health disparities between the Native American population and the rest of the United States. Reasons for these health disparities include \\"cultural barriers, geographic isolation, inadequate sewage disposal, and economic factors.\\"The Health Care Challenge: Acknowledging Disparity, Confronting Discrimination, and Ensuring Equality. United States Commission on Civil Rights, Sept. 1999. However, there are many indicators that the health status of Native Americans has greatly improved in the previous decades. Native American tribes have received much needed attention from the medical field due to the increasing infant mortality rate among their people, while the American nation sees this demographic overall on the decline. The infant mortality rate of American Indians and Native Alaskans is 8.6 for every 1,000 live births. This is greater than the average infant mortality rate of all ages of 6.9, all measured in 2005. Native American infants suffer from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome at double the rate of their white counterparts. For congenital malformations and low birth weight, Native Americans infants suffer at a ratio of 1.3 to non-Hispanic whites. Low birth weight was observed in 7.3% of births in 2005. Also notable is the fact that as the age of the birth mother increases, the ratio of Native American infant mortality to non-Hispanic white infant mortality increases. In 2005, Native Americans recorded 14,037 deaths. This translates to 438.5 deaths per 100,000 individuals. Within the United States region, Native American men have been found to be dying at the fastest rate of all people. The life expectancy of a Native American man is 71 years, six below the expectancy of a white male in the United States. Women fare at a similar level, with their death rate growing 20% over fifteen years of American national decline. The leading causes of death among Native Americans (American Indians and Alaskan Natives) are heart disease, cancer and unintentional injury. The rate of suicide is also a significant concern, as it is above the American national average. Native Americans also face a disproportional share of certain diseases. Native American disease and epidemics are commonly thought of as being alcoholism on tribal lands and surrounding areas. Many other diseases, such as diabetes, have a prominent presence among Native Americans. Native American children, in 2006, received \\"the recommended doses of vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, Hib, polio, and chicken pox at the same rate as non-Hispanic White children.\\" Out of the single race population of Native Americans and Native Alaskans, about 16.8% of individuals have a disability. The majority of those with disabilities are in the 18- to 64-year-old age range, though this is also the largest demographic. For those age 18 and under, about 6% have a disability. About 17.9% of those American Indian and Alaska Natives ages 18 to 64 have a disability. Disabilities are far more prevalent in the eldest age range, 65 years and older, but this is a normal trend due to the effect of diseases on aging demographics. Native Americans also have high rates of mental health challenges. For instance, \\"Native Americans report themselves as under \\"frequent mental stress\\" 20 percent more than other populations.\\"Project, Harvard, Eric C. Henson, Jonathan B. Taylor, Catherine E. A. Curtis, Stephen Cornell, Kenneth W. Grant, Miriam R. Jorgensen, Joseph P. Kalt, and Andrew J. Lee. The State of the Native Nations Conditions under U.S. Policies of Self- Determination. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2007. Print. There are many other health behaviors that are present in different rates in the Native American demographic. Out of all races and ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rate of smoking. As of 2008, about 32.2% of Native American adults smoked. This is in contrast to a rate of 21.8% for white adults. The high prevalence of smoking is also present in the Native American youth, as 23.1% of the youth smoke. Additionally, Native Americans had the highest rate of smoking during pregnancy, at 17.8%. Smoking itself plays into Native American culture, therefore it is a challenging health concern. Other health behaviors that contribute to the current health status include the high rates of obesity and generally low rates of physical activity.United States. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vital and Health Statistics. Health Characteristics of the American Indian and Alaska Native Adult Population. By Patricia M. Barnes. 356th ed. 2005. Print. Studies frequently note ‚Äúa frequency of poor health and limited health care options‚Äù for Native Americans in the United States. Insurance coverage is held by the majority of Native Americans, but 33% of American Indians and Alaska Natives do not possess health insurance. About 36% did have private health insurance to cover their medical care, while 24% relied on Medicaid provided through the federal government. In addition to these services available to all Americans, the need for health care for Native Americans has been addressed by the American government. Currently there is a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services called the Indian Health Service. The IHS serves to provide health care services and administer various medical programs. Although this service serves many Native Americans, health care is still lacking for the masses. 33% of Native Americans reportedly did not have health insurance in 2007. Substance abuse In 2002, Native Americans and Alaskan Natives were at a much higher risk than other minority populations for heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol dependence. A study carried out from 2002 to 2005 reported that 10.7 percent of all Native American and Alaskan Native age groups suffered from alcohol use disorder, whereas 7.6 percent of other ethnic groups reported the same disorder. Alcoholism is a particular issue among Native American women. General statistics indicate that Native American women drink less than men; however, specific tribal social norms and location cause this to vary among individuals. As a result, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder rates are higher than the national average in some tribes. Among tribes in Alaska, the rate of fetal alcohol syndrome, 5.6 every 1,000 births, is nearly four times higher than non-Indians' rate, 1.5 every 1,000 births. Overall, 11.7% of Native American and Alaskan Native deaths are alcohol-related, which includes traffic accidents, alcoholic liver disease, homicide, suicide, and falls.  Other drugs  Native Americans are more likely than other ethnic groups to report past year illicit drug abuse. *SITE CLOSED*see justice.gov's archive at http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/ Mexican drug- trafficking organizations are the main suppliers of illegal substances to reservations in Indian Country and presumed growers of marijuana on reservations. *SITE CLOSED*see justice.gov's archive Drug-trafficking organizations run by African-American, Asian, and Native American gangs and criminal groups also smuggle and supply on-reservation drug retailers with inventories of marijuana, ice methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. The most commonly abused drug on reservations is marijuana because of its ready availability. *SITE CLOSED*see justice.gov's archive The number of Native Americans seeking help for marijuana addiction increased from 1,119 to 2,147 from 2003 to 2007. It is a potentially alarming statistic in the face of declining rates of reported marijuana use among 12- to 17- and 18- to 25-year- olds nationwide. Recently, methamphetamine cartels have targeted Native American communities due to conflicts in jurisdiction between tribal, state, and federal law enforcement agencies that complicates the prosecution of methamphetamine producers and distributors. The resulting spike in rates of methamphetamine abuse and addiction has made the drug a law enforcement priority on many reservations in the American West, particularly the Wind River Indian Reservation of Wyoming, and the Crow Nation, Blackfeet Nation, and Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation of Montana.

Personal life She was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1927. Her family, who were Jewish, left Germany in 1935. Her father Sigmund‚Äôs naturalization papers indicate that she arrived with him and her mother Bertha in Miami from Cuba on SS Florida January 3, 1940. He lists Cuba as their last place of residence. She died on November 11, 2010, at age 83, due to heart failure. Education Neumark graduated B.A. summa cum laude (Chemistry) from Barnard College in 1948 and M.A. (Chemistry) at Radcliffe College in the following year. She completed her Ph.D. in Chemistry at Columbia University in 1951; her thesis entitled \\"Free cloud approximation to molecular orbital calculations\\".  Career Following her PhD, she joined the Sylvania Research Laboratories in Bayside, NY as a Senior Physicist. In 1960, she moved to the Philips Laboratories, Briarcliff Manor, NY where she worked until 1985. She was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1982. From 1982 to 1985, she was visiting-adjunct Professor of Materials Science at Columbia University, and became a full Professor of Materials Science there in 1985. In 1999, she became the Howe Professor Emerita of Materials Science and Engineering and Professor Emerita of Applied Physics and Mathematics at Columbia University. Research & patents In the 1980s, Neumark began studying the optical properties of wide bandgap semiconductors and developed diodes capable of using the upper range of the spectrum and serving as a superior light source. The new short-wavelength LEDs, emitting blue, green, violet and ultraviolet light, turned out to be much more energy efficient, reliable and long-lived while the short-wavelength-emitting laser diodes could store vastly more information more compactly. This new technology lent itself to a wide variety of applications, from billboards and traffic lights to hand- held mobile devices and high-definition DVD players. Her research led to remarkable advances in the field of electronics, including establishing blue, green, and ultraviolet LEDs as common components in electronics. She holds a number of patents on wide-bandgap semiconductor technology, though faced challenges in having her work recognized. In relation with infringing on two of her semiconductor patents, she had to file lawsuits against several electronics companies, including the Philips Lumileds Lighting Company, Epistar, Toyoda Gosei and Osram in 2005, which were subsequently settled out of court. In 2008, Neumark again had to file a complaint seeking to block imports into the United States of a range of products that she said were infringing her patents on wide-bandgap semiconductor technology, resulting in a number of companies agreeing to license the patents. According to family members, the suits were not about money but about fairness‚Äîespecially for women scientists‚Äîshe thought were being discriminated against.

Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28 (1913), was a United States Supreme Court case deciding whether the federal government's law prohibiting liquor on the land of Santa Clara Pueblo impermissibly infringed on the State of New Mexico's police power under the equal footing doctrine. In a unanimous decision, the Court upheld the law and Congress' ability to recognize and regulate Tribes. Citing broad Congressional authority in Kagama,. recognition of Tribes subject to the guardianship of the federal government falls on Congress, not the Court, as long as recognition is not \\"arbitrary\\" and actually reflects \\"distinctly Indian communities.\\". Background The King of Spain granted formal title to the Pueblo people in 1689. Mexico ceded most of what is today New Mexico to the United States in 1848 under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. New Mexico was a territory until January 6, 1912, when it became the forty seventh state to be added to the United States. Previous decisions of the US Supreme Court held that the Nonintercourse Act did not restrict the alienability of Pueblo peoples or lands. When the Supreme Court reversed its position in 1913, the land title to much of the state was called into question. Justice Miller of the Supreme Court had previously ruled, \\"Every person who makes a settlement on any lands belonging, secured, or granted by treaty with the United States to any Indian tribe, or surveys or attempts to survey said lands, or to designate any of the boundaries by marking trees or otherwise, is liable to a penalty of $1,000.\\". Congress responded in 1924 and 1933 with compromise legislation to extinguish some aboriginal title and to establish procedures for determination and compensation. In United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28 (1913), the question before the Supreme Court was whether Pueblo lands, which were owned by land grants with the Spanish government and later recognized by the United States after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, were \\"owned\\" by the Pueblo peoples. The case involved the sale of alcohol by a non-Indian, Felipe Sandoval, to the Pueblo of New Mexico at the San Juan Village. Sandoval argued such sales were legal, based on decisions territorial court since 1905. New Mexico became a State in 1912. The Statehood Act acknowledged Pueblo lands as \\"Indian Country\\" defined as \\"distinctly Indian communities, recognized and treated by the government as dependent communities entitled to federal protection.\\" The court ultimately ruled that it was for Congress alone to determine when guardianship over Indians should cease. The citizenship of Indians did not prevent Congress from enacting laws to protect and benefit tribes. Opinion Justice Willis Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the Court. The Court held that the enabling act applied generally applicable federal Indian statutes to the Pueblo. Sandoval repudiated the prior Supreme Court case of United States v. Joseph (1876), which had held that the Pueblos were not \\"Indians.\\"Wilcomb B. Washburn, Red Man's Land White Man's Land 141 (2d ed. 1995). Aftermath Bootlegging \\"Bootlegging\\" of alcohol continued after the decision. The Bureau of Indian Affairs took little action against bootleggers, although tribal courts did mete out punishment.Mark Harrison Moore & Dean R. Gerstein, Alcohol and public policy: beyond the shadow of prohibition 397 (National Research Council (U.S.) Panel on Alternative Policies Affecting the Prevention of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ). In 1953, the BIA lifted the ban on possession and distribution of alcohol, as part of its \\"tribalization\\" policy. Implications for Pueblo lands Senator Holm Bursum (R-NM) Sandoval, by holding that Pueblo lands were Indian Indian Country, at least for purposes of liquor regulation by the federal government, cast a cloud over many non-Indian land titles in New Mexico. In effect, the Court had repudiated the prior view that the Pueblo held land in fee simple and were able to sell land to non- Indians without Congressional approval. The federal government, which viewed the Pueblo title as held by tribes rather than individual Indians, argued that the Nonintercourse Act applied.N. Bruce Duthu, American Indians and the Law 84-85, 198 (2008). Further, the federal government viewed the Pueblo as a \\"domestic dependent nation\\" within the meaning of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia. and Worcester v. Georgia. .William C Canby Jr., American Indian Law 388-89 (1998). New Mexico Senator Holm Bursum proposed legislation to quiet titles in the states. Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall also supported this approach. The bill was discussed on November 3, 1922 at a meeting of 19 Pueblos in Santo Domingo between. The Pueblos opposed the legislation, publishing \\"An Appeal for Fair Play and the Preservation of Pueblo Land\\" on November 5, 1922. John Collier published articles outlining the reasons for the Pueblo's opposition in the Santa Fe New Mexican (November 6) and the New York Times (November 7). Soon thereafter, the hearings for the bill were delayed until February 1923. In the interim, Secretary Fall was replaced. A compromise bill was created in 1924, which some Pueblos supported. The new bill created a Pueblo Lands Board to resolve disputed claims.

The engine first ran in 1927. The H-1640 was the first airworthy 'inline radial' and was sponsored for flight testing in a range of aircraft by the U.S. Government. Among the types selected were the Thomas-Morse XP-13 and the Curtiss XO-18. Cooling problems with the rear cylinders caused the project to be canceled with few production engines being built. A similar engine is the Bristol Hydra although this engine had 16 aligned cylinders, forming an octagon. Further similar engines are the Armstrong Siddeley Hyena and the much larger Armstrong Siddeley Deerhound.

Life and work Yousef Al-Mohaimeed was born on January 31, 1964, during the Islamic month of Ramadan in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He was the first boy born to the family after seven girls (three of whom had died). As a child, Yousef was often sick. After his youngest brother died of food poisoning, his mother became very protective of him. His childhood illnesses would prove important in his development as a writer. Yousef spent many hours reading, and would sometimes even pretend to be sick so that his youngest sister would buy him a book. Perhaps one of his earliest creative endeavors was making up endings for the Saga of Saif Bin Dhi Yazn, as his copy was missing the last few pages. As a young man, Yousef excelled in painting and photography. At age 10, he won an award for children's painting, and went on to study Arabic calligraphy. At age 15 he began to study literature at the Jazeera secondary school. It was during this time that he began to write and publish short stories. When Al-Mohaimeed entered the Faculty of Management Sciences at King Saud University at age 18, he became more involved with politics, and began editing a weekly magazine called Hiwar, meaning dialogue. The magazine, which published politically sensitive articles, was banned, and Al-Mohaimeed was nearly expelled for his involvement. He devoted himself more fully to literature, but his first collection of short stories, Zahira La Musha Laha (An Afternoon Without Pedestrians)published in 1989, was withdrawn from the market after a well-known religious leader complained that it was immoral. However, Al-Mohaimeed has been successful in publishing his work in other countries--Rajfat Athwabihim Al Beed (The Movement of Their White Robes) was published in Cairo in 1993, and La Budda Anna Ahadan Harraka Al Kurrasa (Someone Must Have Moved the Notebook) in Beirut in 1996. After graduation, Al-Mohaimeed worked in accounting and journalism. In 1998, he traveled to Britain to study English and photography. In 2000, Al-Mohaimeed returned to his home of Riyadh. His first novel, Laghat Mawta (The Gossip of the Dead), was published in 2000 by the Arab Writer's Union in Damascus.http://www.al- mohaimeed.net/english/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=104:yousef- al-mohaimeed&catid;=47:biography&Itemid;=110 Yousef Al-Mohaimeed is one of the more exciting and critically acclaimed of a recent wave of Saudi writers emerging from the heavily censored, intellectually oppressive environment.http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090220/REVIEW/239172920/1194 In 2008,Wolves of the Crescent Moon which was banned in Saudi Arabia, became his first book published outside of the Middle East.

He had a low profile in the Senate, having not held a Senate leadership position or major committee chairmanship. The Savannah Morning News described Chapman as \\"considered a bit of a maverick\\"; favoring \\"property rights, environmental protection, water conservation, gun owner rights, open government and limiting taxes.\\" One of Chapman's major causes was an effort to combat redevelopment on Jekyll Island. Chapman unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the 2010 Georgia gubernatorial election. During his campaign, he advocated the repeal of the state income tax and its replacement with a state sales tax. Although locally popular, he ranked low in the Republican primary polls, and was seen as a long-shot contender. Chapman placed fifth out of seven candidates in the July 2010, with 20,636 votes (3.0%).

A headless system is typically controlled over a network connection, although some headless system devices require a serial connection to be made over RS-232 for administration of the device. Headless operation of a server is typically employed to reduce operating costs.  PC BIOS limitations  During bootup, some (especially older) PC BIOS versions will wait indefinitely for a user to press a key before proceeding. If some basic device, such as a video card or keyboard, are not installed or connected, this could effectively halt an unattended system. On more modern systems, the BIOS factory setting will typically be configured to behave this way as well, but this setting can be changed with a BIOS setup utility to proceed without user intervention. Even in cases where a system has been set up to be managed remotely, a local keyboard and video card may still be needed from time to time. For example, diagnose boot problems that occur before a remote access application is initialized.  Hardware remote control  Some servers provide for remote control with an internal network card and hardware that mirrors the console screen. For example, HP offers a system called Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) that provides this function. Remote access to the system is gained using a secure web connection to an IP address assigned to the iLO adapter, and allows for monitoring of the system during start-up, before the operating system is loaded. Another hardware solution is to use a KVM-over-IP switch. Such a switch is a traditional Keyboard-Video-Mouse device with the added ability to provide remote control sessions over IP. Connection to the KVM device is gained using a web browser, which allows for remote monitoring of the connected system console port.

It is dedicated to Saint Achillius of Larissa, a fighter against Arianism and participant of the First Council of Nicaea in 325. The church was built in 1296 by Serbian King Stefan Dragutin of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty and is located in the center of town, on the elevated plateau above the large river valley and the river Moravica and Big Rzav, and represents the most dominant object in the Arilje region. History Stefan Nemanja's council, from the church. The church was built in 1296 by King Stefan Dragutin of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty, on the location of an earlier monastery built in 1219. The earlier monastery was the seat of the Bishop of Moravica, one of twelve eparchies established by Archbishop Sava in 1219. It is dedicated to Saint Achillius from Larissa (Greece), a fighter against Arianism and participant of the First Council of Nicaea in 325. God made him celebrate victory over Arianism, making a miracle to Achillius confession of the truth water runs from stone. Characteristics Architecture According to its architectural properties, it belongs to the Ra≈°ka architectural style, which marked the 13th century, coherent joint processing Romanesque exterior and Byzantine spatial concept. Imaging facade in the style of Byzantine cells unity, construction techniques alternating rows of stone and brick, the wall is finished the Romanesque Saint Achillius Church in Arilje make unique civil engineering in the 13th century of the total area of Byzantine world. What distinguishes the church from other Nemanjiƒá endowments built in this era is in addition to his height and lack of a specific aspect of the belfry tower of the outer narthex, which is characteristic of all bishop offices, entrance on the south side instead of the usual western. Unlike other Nemanjiƒá churches built in the 12th and 13th century, which were not cathedral temples dedicated to many believers, the church in Arilje had that purpose, and it was built on the hill from which it was visible from afar. At the time of Emperor Du≈°an, the Eparchy of Moravica was elevated to the rank of Metropolitanate, after the proclamation of the Serbian Patriarchate on Easter 1346. Metropolis in Arilje monastery brotherhood and shared the fate of his people and country in a terrible rush of the Turks led by Mehmed II the Conqueror of Constantinople. They had to go nearly two centuries to the end of the forties 17th century revived again in the metropolitanate Moravica. Arilje bells will ring no sooner than in 1833. But this time not from the metropolitanate, but the parish church. The Church of St. Achillius was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. Frescoes Founder fresco of King Stefan Dragutin, founder of the church, 1296. Note that he is depicted holding his endowment. In addition to architectural value and historic significance, the church stands out as a gallery of precious frescoes. The most interesting part of the fresco-assembly make portraits of rulers from the Nemanjiƒá, their relatives and all the archbishops of the founding of the independent Serbian church. Most attractive portraits in the southern part of the inner narthex, standing figure of King Dragutin patrons with the model of the church in the hands of the fresco above the tomb of Dragutin's younger son Uro≈°iƒá, who died young as a monk. As an unambiguous document, the kings of donor activities and illustration of mutual respect (at the time of painting the church brothers lived in harmony), one of the most beautiful idealized portrait is a portrait of royal brothers Milutin and Dragutin Nemanjiƒá accompanied by Dragutin's wife, Arpad Princess of Hungary Katalin. For the first time in the history of Serbian fresco-paintings appears a new iconographic solution. Until then, it was common for the donor or the Virgin performances brought patron saint protector of Christ on the throne, bowed his head with the model of the temple in his hands. Fresco of St. Archangel Gabriel, called The Blue Angel, St. noble character in brilliant, simple Tunica, the incarnation of the Lord of Trustees fanciful ideas of beauty and magnificence of nobility. Certainly set a figure of Archangel, clearly marked characters with strong muscles and a rich gown of warriors, is very artistic value. This fresco is classified in the narrowest circle of masterpieces of Serbian paintings. Historical importance have portraits of Dragutin's sons - Vladislav and Uro≈°iƒá and present members of the Serbian church and Nemanjiƒá vines and moraviƒçkih portraits of bishops and metropolitan's, are one of the most important group of wall paintings through which recognize the interesting characters of the Serbian past. Authors of Arilje frescoes are not known by name, but we know that they originated from Thessaloniki. The stylistic and iconographic terms of the paintings is a work that announces a milestone in the development of Serbian mural painting. Burials *Uro≈°ic, Dragutin's younger son, was buried in the church, indicating the importance of the temple for the king and the possibility that some of the courts were located in the vicinity of Arilje.

Red and green lines represent the range of the estimates while time is measured in billions of years ago (Ga). Stage 1 (3.85‚Äì2.45 Ga): Practically no O2 in the atmosphere. Stage 2 (2.45‚Äì1.85 Ga): O2 produced, but absorbed in oceans and seabed rock. Stage 3 (1.85‚Äì0.85 Ga): O2 starts to gas out of the oceans, but is absorbed by land surfaces and formation of ozone layer. Stages 4 and 5 (0.85 Ga‚Äìpresent): O2 sinks filled, the gas accumulates. Before photosynthesis evolved, Earth's atmosphere had no free oxygen (O2). Photosynthetic prokaryotic organisms that produced O2 as a waste product lived long before the first build-up of free oxygen in the atmosphere, perhaps as early as 3.5 billion years ago. The oxygen they produced would have been rapidly removed from the oceans by weathering of reducing minerals, most notably iron. This rusting led to the deposition of iron oxide on the ocean floor, forming banded iron formations. Thus, the oceans rusted and turned red. Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxygenation Event. This mass oxygenation of the atmosphere resulted in rapid buildup of free oxygen. At current rates of primary production, today's concentration of oxygen could be produced by photosynthetic organisms in 2,000 years. In the absence of plants, the rate of oxygen production by photosynthesis was slower in the Precambrian, and the concentrations of O2 attained were less than 10% of today's and probably fluctuated greatly; oxygen may even have disappeared from the atmosphere again around 1.9 billion years ago. These fluctuations in oxygen concentration had little direct effect on life, with mass extinctions not observed until the appearance of complex life around the start of the Cambrian period, . The presence of provided life with new opportunities. Aerobic metabolism is more efficient than anaerobic pathways, and the presence of oxygen created new possibilities for life to explore. Since the start of the Cambrian period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 35% of atmospheric volume. The maximum of 35% was reached towards the end of the Carboniferous period (about 300 million years ago), a peak which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at that time. Whilst human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, affect relative carbon dioxide concentrations, their effect on the much larger concentration of oxygen is less significant. Effects on life The Great Oxygenation Event had the first major affect on the course of evolution. Due to the rapid buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere, many organisms that didn't rely on oxygen to live died. The concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is often cited as a possible contributor to large-scale evolutionary phenomena, such as the origin of the multicellular Ediacara biota, the Cambrian explosion, trends in animal body size, and other extinction and diversification events. The large size of insects and amphibians in the Carboniferous period, when the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere reached 35%, has been attributed to the limiting role of diffusion in these organisms' metabolism. But Haldane's essay points out that it would only apply to insects. However, the biological basis for this correlation is not firm, and many lines of evidence show that oxygen concentration is not size-limiting in modern insects. There is no significant correlation between atmospheric oxygen and maximum body size elsewhere in the geological record. Ecological constraints can better explain the diminutive size of post-Carboniferous dragonflies - for instance, the appearance of flying competitors such as pterosaurs, birds and bats. Rising oxygen concentrations have been cited as one of several drivers for evolutionary diversification, although the physiological arguments behind such arguments are questionable, and a consistent pattern between oxygen concentrations and the rate of evolution is not clearly evident. The most celebrated link between oxygen and evolution occurs at the end of the last of the Snowball glaciations, where complex multicellular life is first found in the fossil record. Under low oxygen concentrations and before the evolution of nitrogen fixation, biologically-available nitrogen compounds were in limited supply and periodic \\"nitrogen crises\\" could render the ocean inhospitable to life. Significant concentrations of oxygen were just one of the prerequisites for the evolution of complex life. Models based on uniformitarian principles (i.e. extrapolating present-day ocean dynamics into deep time) suggest that such a concentration was only reached immediately before metazoa first appeared in the fossil record. Further, anoxic or otherwise chemically \\"nasty\\" oceanic conditions that resemble those supposed to inhibit macroscopic life re-occur at intervals through the early Cambrian, and also in the late Cretaceous - with no apparent effect on lifeforms at these times. This might suggest that the geochemical signatures found in ocean sediments reflect the atmosphere in a different way before the Cambrian - perhaps as a result of the fundamentally different mode of nutrient cycling in the absence of planktivory. An oxygen- rich atmosphere can release phosphorus and iron from rock, by weathering, and these elements then become available for sustenance of new species whose metabolisms require these elements as oxides.

England's fauna is mainly made up of small animals and is notable for having few large mammals, but in similarity with other island nations; many bird species. England for the most part has an oceanic climate, which lacks extremes of heat or cold and provides plentiful rainfall making the country a rather 'green' environment and providing much food for small and grazing animals. England is different in respect to Scotland in its wildlife due to its slightly warmer climate, lower land levels and more dense populations, and whilst this is bad for some species of animals, it is good for others. The fauna of England is also very diverse since its landscapes are very different from each other and so this is represented in the flora and fauna. Overview England has a temperate oceanic climate in most areas, lacking extremes of cold or heat, but does have a few small areas of subarctic and warmer areas in the South West. Towards the North of England the climate becomes colder and most of England's mountains and high hills are located here and have a major impact on the climate and thus the local fauna of the areas. Deciduous woodlands are common across all of England and provide a great habitat for much of England's wildlife, but these give way in northern and upland areas of England to coniferous forests (mainly plantations) which also benefit certain forms of wildlife. The fauna of England has to cope with varying temperatures and conditions, although not extreme they do pose potential challenges and adaptational measures. English fauna has however had to cope with industrialisation, human population densities amongst the highest in Europe and intensive farming, but as England is a developed nation, wildlife and the countryside have entered the English mindset more and the country is very conscientious about preserving its wildlife, environment and countryside. European rabbit Some species have adapted to the expanded urban environment, particularly the red fox, which is the most successful urban mammal after the brown rat, and other animals such as common wood pigeon, both of which thrive in urban and suburban areas. Invertebrates Molluscs There are 220 species of non-marine molluscs that have been recorded as living in the wild in Britain and England. There are also 14 gastropod species that live only in greenhouses. Insects Vertebrates Amphibians Pool frog The species of amphibian native to England are the great crested newt, smooth newt, palmate newt, common toad, natterjack toad, common frog and the pool frog. Several other species have become naturalised. Reptiles Four species of snake are, the European adder, grass snake, barred grass snake and smooth snake. Some introduced snakes are aesculapian snake and dice snakes. Adder Lizards found in England are slowworms, common lizards, sand lizards, European green lizards (introduced) and the common wall lizard (introduced from mainland Europe - found in the Isle of Wight.) Turtles found off the English coast are the leatherback sea turtle, green sea turtle, hawksbill, loggerhead sea turtle, Kemp's ridley and appear to be visiting English waters in increasingly larger numbers as the seas around Britain warm due to climate change. Terrapins found in England are the European pond terrapin (introduced from mainland Europe) and the red-eared terrapin (introduced, but not established). Birds Atlantic puffins are found in some areas of the English coast. English avifauna bears resemblances to that of continental Europe, consisting largely of Palaearctic species. Being located on an island, it has fewer breeding species than continental Europe, with some species, like the crested lark, breeding as close as northern France, yet unable to colonise Britain. However England and the British Isles as a whole do boast many wading and shorebirds and England's coastlines are very important habitats for seabirds. England's coastline being generally flatter and sandier than that of its neighbouring UK countries is mainly a magnet for wading birds, but it does have some more rocky areas suitable for birds such as puffins. The mild winters mean that many species that cannot cope with harsher conditions can winter in Britain, and also that there is a large influx of wintering birds from the continent or beyond and even as far as South Africa. There are about 250 species regularly recorded in England, and another 300 that occur with varying degrees of rarity.  Mammals  Muntjac deer Minke whale and a boat in the British water England doesn't have many large mammals and is mainly populated by smaller mammals. Apart from semi-feral horses such as the Dartmoor pony and Exmoor pony, the largest wild land animals in England are European bison, with the bison being England's largest land mammal and found in a few areas such as the Lake District and Exmoor. England has a few non-native species of deer which have become naturalized to the similar climate from areas of continental Europe and Southern Siberia and whilst the Scottish red deer thrives the most in Scotland, smaller species of deer, both native and introduced thrive in England, with some being absent or near-absent from Scotland (such as the muntjac deer). Roe deer Insectivores and other small mammals There are also several species of insectivore in England and the rest of Britain. The hedgehog is probably the most widely known as it is a regular visitor to urban gardens. It is also vulnerable to road traffic, and many are killed crossing busy motorways and dual carriageways. The mole is also widely recognised and its subterranean lifestyle causes much damage to garden lawns and some gardeners trap or kill them (although this is illegal). Shrews are also fairly common, and the smallest, the pygmy shrew, is one of the smallest mammals in the world. There are also several species of bat found in England: the pipistrelle bat is the smallest and the most common of them all. Rodents are also numerous across Britain and England, particularly the brown rat which is by far the most abundant urban animal after humans. Some however, are becoming increasingly rare. Habitat destruction has led to a population decrease in the number of dormice and bank voles found in Britain. Grey squirrels introduced from eastern America have forced the decline of the native red squirrel due to competition. Red squirrels are now confined to upland and coniferous-forested areas of England, mainly in the north, south west and Isle of Wight. England's climate is very suitable for lagomorphs and the country has rabbits and brown hares which were introduced in Roman times. Mountain hares which are indigenous have now been re-introduced in Derbyshire. Carnivores European polecats There is a variety of carnivores, especially from the weasel family. These ranging in size from the weasel, stoat and European polecat (rare in England, mainly found in the Welsh Marches and heavily interbred with domestic ferrets) to the badger and pine marten, and the recently introduced mink and semiaquatic otter. There is an ongoing debate in England about whether badgers should be culled or vaccinated in order to reduce the spread of bovine tuberculosis. In the absence of the extinct wolf and brown bear, the largest carnivore is the red fox, the adaptability and opportunism of which has allowed it to proliferate in the urban environment. Weasels and foxes dominate the role of carnivores in England and are very common in the countryside and in towns and some cities. Sea mammals England's seas are a haven for many sea mammals, including various types of whales, dolphins and seals. The grey seal although rare in other parts of the world is to be found in relatively large numbers along the English coast.

He later hosted 'Hot Line' on RJR and then Straight Talk on KLAS FM 89, before hosting Perkins On Line on Hot 102 FM. In April 2002, he took his program Perkins On Line to POWER 106 FM. With his probing interviews and keen analyses of current events, the program made for compulsive listening. Perkins On Line is spirited interaction with callers on a wide range of topics. It is described by many as \\"The Poor Man's University.\\" A typical caller will often attribute his or her widening knowledge of events happening in and outside of Jamaica to the information garnered from just listening to these broadcasts. Perkins said the program aimed to \\"focus public attention on the gaping hiatus between what is and what might be, and to do it within a broad framework that embraces not only the history of Jamaica, but the history of mankind.\\" Controversy Some often disagreed with Perkins, but he revelled in controversy\\"Wilmot 'Motty' Perkins: the man we love to hate.\\", Date Accessed: 2009-09-17. and these calls added spice. He said that \\"if people really think about it, they might discover that 'Perkins on Line' is more profoundly positive than negative.\\" That's why it was called the \\"Thinking Persons' call-in show\\". Perkins was sued 28 times for libel or slander but none of the suits was tried or settled out of court.

BCCI went insolvent due to massive fraud, connection with terrorists, money-laundering, extortion and a raft of other criminal activity on a global scale. Malik and Mahmud had both lost their jobs and they sought employment elsewhere. They could not find jobs. They sued the company for their loss of job prospects, alleging that their failure to secure new jobs was due to the reputational damage they had suffered from working with BCCI. Nobody, they said, wanted to hire people from a massive fraud operation like that at the company. This raised the question of what duty the company had owed to its employees that had been broken. Although there was no express term in their contracts, Malik and Mahmud argued there was an implied term in their employment contract that nothing would be done calculated to undermine mutual trust and confidence. The House of Lords unanimously held that the term of mutual trust and confidence would be implied into the contract as a necessary incident of the employment relation. This was a term implied by law.

The nightrider was invented by T. R. Dawson in 1925, and is often used in chess problems. Movement The nightrider moves any number of steps as a knight in the same direction. Intervening squares must be vacant. For example, a nightrider on b2 can reach square c4 and forward to d6 and e8, but cannot jump over the f4-pawn to reach h5. Examples The king together with two knights cannot win the endgame against a lone king (KSS vs. K), but the king together with a knight and a nightrider can win, because the knight cannot gain a tempo, but the nightrider can.

Its fossil remains consist of a single juvenile specimen probably uncovered in Mongolia, or possibly northeastern China. The type species is R. kriegsteini, described in 2009 by Sereno and colleagues. The genus name is derived from Latin ', \\"robber\\", and ', \\"king\\". The specific name honours Roman Kriegstein, a survivor of the Holocaust, whose son Henry Kriegstein donated the specimen to the University of Chicago for scientific study. While initially considered to have come from the Yixian Formation of China, dated to approximately 125 million years ago during the early Cretaceous period, later studies showed that such an early date for the fossil are unlikely, and given its extremely close similarity to juvenile tyrannosaurids of the late Cretaceous, it probably came from the Iren Dabasu or similar formation. Because the specimen is a juvenile, and the changes undergone by tyrannosaurids during growth are not yet well understood, many researchers now consider it to be a nomen dubium, because it cannot be confidently paired with an adult skeleton (though it is extremely similar to juvenile Tarbosaurus bataar skeletons of the same size and age). Description Size of the juvenile specimen compared to a human. The only known Raptorex specimen shows the same basic proportions as juvenile tyrannosaurids: a comparatively large and solidly-constructed skull, long legs with adaptations for running, and tiny, two-fingered forelimbs. This is in contrast with more basal tyrannosauroids such as Dilong, which retained features characteristic of more basal coelurosaurs such as a small head and long, three-fingered forelimbs. Hypothetical life restoration of an adult Raptorex kriegsteini|alt= The specimen is a very small juvenile, estimated at long and about . The holotype (LH PV18) measured about and died in its third year. History Discovery According to Peter Larson, who attempted to re-trace the origins of the specimen, the holotype fossil of Raptorex (currently designated LH PV18 and housed in the collections of the Long Hao Institute of Geology and Paleontology in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China) was purchased from a Mongolian fossil dealer by an American businessman in Tokyo, Japan, and subsequently taken to the United States, where it was again put up for sale at the Tucson, Arizona Gem, Mineral and Fossil Show. There it was sold by Hollis Butts to Dr. Henry Kriegstein, an ophthalmologist and fossil collector. Up until this point, the specimen had been identified as a juvenile specimen of Tarbosaurus, which had been collected from Mongolia. Kriegstein notified American paleontologist Paul Sereno of the specimen, who proposed it represented a subadult of a new species from the Yixian Formation of China. Sereno arranged to publish a description of the specimen and to have it sent to China, from where he assumed it had been smuggled. Initial interpretation In Sereno's description of the specimen, he and his co- authors interpreted it as a near-adult aged about six years. Sereno initially stated to the press that numerous index fossils present in the rock slab surrounding the specimen showed it belonged to Early Cretaceous. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Sereno said ‚ÄúFrom sediments, fossil fish bones, turtles, clam shells and other fauna we recovered from the rock matrix alongside the Raptorex fossil, we could generally pinpoint where it had been dug up in an area along the border with Inner Mongolia.\\"Mullen W (2009) Fossil identified as mini-T. rex. Chicago Tribune, Sept 18th 2009. Available: http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-09-18/news/0909170802_1_fossil-bones- tyrannosaurus-rex-chicago-paleontologist-paul-sereno. Accessed 2011 March 8. However, only a single fish vertebra and a crushed, unidentifiable mollusk shell were actually present alongside the Raptorex specimen. Sereno and colleagues identified the fish vertebra as being similar to the genus Lycoptera, a key index fossil of the early Cretaceous Yixian formation. However, they did not describe the bone or note any features in common with known Lycoptera specimens. Sereno's interpretation of the specimen as an early, primitive, non-tyrannosaurid tyrannosauroid would have major implications for the evolution of tyrannosaurs. Rather than evolving their distinct anatomy of a large head, long legs and tiny, two-fingered arms only after large body size, a small, early Cretaceous species with similar proportions to adults of true tyrannosaurids would indicate that the characteristic tyrannosaur shape appeared prior to the advent of giant size in the group. This would contradict previous evidence, as all previously known primitive tyrannosaurs had small skulls and long, three-fingered arms, including contemporary species and those that lived later in the Cretaceous than Sereno believed Raptorex to have lived. Controversy and re- interpretation Skull restoration In October 2010 an online Nature News report (not peer-reviewed) challenged the provenance and classification of Raptorex as a basal tyrannosauroid. Peter Larson, president of the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, Inc., a private fossil excavation and supply company, inspected the fossil and told Nature that he concluded it was a juvenile Tarbosaurus. Because the specimen was donated by a collector without detailed provenance information, Larson doubted the assigned age, which was based only on the Lycoptera vertebra and mollusk shell found alongside the dinosaur fossil. Larson speculated that the fossil could have come from beds in Mongolia that yield fossils of Tarbosaurus, dating from 70 million years ago. He has suggested \\"a more detailed analysis of the fossil matrix‚Äîincluding dating of any pollen associated with the fossil.\\" Sereno is quoted in the report as standing by his conclusions, noting that definite evidence or a publication had not been produced refuting them. In June 2011, a more detailed re-study was published in the peer-reviewed journal PLoS ONE by Denver Fowler, Peter Larson and others reanalyzing the published data, which they stated to be equivocal regarding stratigraphic position, and that ontogenetic interpretation in the description had overestimated the maturity of the specimen. While Sereno had claimed that the vertebrae of Raptorex were nearly fused, and that the bone histology of the specimen indicated it was a subadult about six years old, Fowler and colleagues argued that Sereno and his team had misinterpreted the growth stage data, and found that the specimen was actually a young juvenile only about three years old. They also found fault with the Sereno team's interpretation of the specimen's age. Fowler and colleagues showed that the fish bone which Sereno had identified as Lycoptera without comment is actually very different in shape and much larger in size than any known specimen of Lycoptera and cannot even be assigned to the same order as that genus. Rather, it probably belonged to an ellimmichthyiform fish, which span the entire Cretaceous period, rendering the bone useless for dating. In light of this, they noted that there is no reason to believe the fossil dates to the early Cretaceous, and that given its extreme similarity to juvenile tyrannosaurids, a late Cretaceous age is far more likely. Based on this analysis, Fowler and colleagues concluded that Raptorex was much more likely to represent a juvenile tyrannosaurid similar to Tarbosaurus, though its exact identity cannot be known without more information about growth patterns in tyrannosaurids, and further efforts to discover its age. Consequently, Sereno's hypothesis that the derived features of tyrannosaurids evolved in the Early Cretaceous cannot be supported by current evidence. Newbrey et al. (2013) identified the fish vertebra centrum found with the holotype specimen of Raptorex kriegsteini as belonging to a hiodontid, probably representing the same taxon as hiodontid fossils described by the authors from the Late Cretaceous Nemegt Formation of Mongolia. According to Newbrey et al., centra like those of the Nemegt hiodontid are not known from outside the Nemegt Formation; according to the authors, this implies that the vertebra found with the holotype specimen of Raptorex kriegsteini ‚Äì and by extension the holotype of R. kriegsteini itself ‚Äì most likely come from the Nemegt Formation and are Late Cretaceous in age. Classification Restored Raptorex and Psittacosaurus skeletons Raptorex has been interpreted as a tyrannosaurid, tyrannosauroid and a synonym of Tarbosaurus. It is currently placed as a basal tyrannosauroid more derived than Bagaraatan but more basal than Dryptosaurus. Below is a cladogram placing Raptorex as a basal tyrannosauroid. It was published by Loewen et al. in 2013 on PLoS ONE. See also * Timeline of tyrannosaur research References External links *Science Daily: Tiny Tyrannosaur: T.

Synopsis During the latter part of World War II, Judge Murayama, head of the Japanese military police, uses his position to falsely accuse, capture, imprison and torture women in whom he is interested. Namiji Kikushima, a high-class business woman, is one such lady. Kikushima is accused of using her Ginza jewellery shop to finance an anti-government organization. Judge Murayama has Lady Kikushima arrested, and orders the new recruit Taoka to torture her. Taoka falls in love with Kikushima, at first hating torturing her then growing to enjoy it. After a long series of tortures and humiliation, while the Judge espouses his twisted version of morality, Taoka sacrifices himself to enable Lady Kikushima's escape.Lewis, Graham R. \\"The Films of Koyu Ohara\\" in Asian Cult Cinema, #27 (2nd quarter 2000), p. 25. Cast * Naomi Tani: Namiji Kikushima * Kazuo Satake: Keita Taoka * Minoru ≈åk≈çchi: Baron Murayama * Hirokazu Inoue: Lieutenant Nishizaki * Tatsuya Hamaguchi: Inoue * Rei Okamoto * Reika Maki Background Lead actresses Naomi Tani and Rei Okamoto had worked together previously in director Yasuharu Hasebe's Rape! (1976). Tani would work with director Ohara again in Fascination: Portrait of a Lady (1977), and Rope Hell (1978), which also reunited her with Hirokazu Inoue, one of her torturers from Fairy in a Cage. In contrast to these torture-themed films, Ohara had been successful with light, youth-centered comedies, such as his later Pink Tush Girl series. Judge Murayama tortures Lady Namiji Kikushima in the upside-down torture scene described by actress Naomi Tani in a 1998 interview. The scene was not \\"faked\\" with a suspension brace. In a review of the films of K≈çy≈´ Ohara for the journal Asian Cult Cinema, Graham R. Lewis notes that Ohara uses conflict between social classes as a theme in Fairy in a Cage. Both Lady Kikushima and Judge Murayama are members of the upper class, while Taoka, the new recruit ordered to torture Kikushima, is from the lower class. Murayama tells Taoka, \\"Some think I am a sick person, but this form of entertainment has always been reserved for the rich.\\" Taoka is repulsed by this philosophy, and when he comes to enjoy the torturing, sacrifices himself to release the prisoners. In a 2000 interview, Ohara confirmed this class-conflict theme, stating, \\"I think S&M; is noble people's fantasy. In the Roman Empire, the nobility were the spectators at the coliseum as they watched slaves in life threatening games. This is the reason I used a fancy silver chalice to collect the heroine's urine in Fairy In A Cage.\\"Ohara, Koyu. Interviewed by Maki Hamamoto. (2000). \\"Koyu Ohara Speaks Out!\\" Asian Cult Cinema, #27 (2nd quarter, 2000), p. 37. In a 1998 interview, Tani recalled that one scene in Fairy in a Cage was more physically demanding than some of the more notorious ones in Lady Black Rose (1978), which were simple tricks. \\"The worst scenes,\\" she said, \\"are the ones where I'm hung up-side-down and tortured with my legs spread, like in Fairy in a Cage... If you try to fake it by using a suspension brace, the thigh muscles won't show tension. On the other hand, if my legs are tied too loosely, I'll fall. These scenes always demand full-shots, so no trick is ever used. When they tie my torso, the rope technicians-- professional people-- are on the set. These guys put extra effort into tying beautifully and painlessly for me.\\"Tani, Naomi. Interviewed by Hamamoto, Maki. (1998). \\"Naomi Tani - An Interview with Nikkatsu's Queen of SM\\" (Conducted in January 1998 in Kyushu, Japan) in Asian Cult Cinema Number 19, April 1998. p. 43. Jasper Sharp comments that one of the most interesting aspects of Fairy in a Cage, and films of its genre, are their use of \\"shameful and historically sensitive\\" aspects of the World War II-era in Japan as subjects for sexually- oriented entertainment. He notes that this era would have been alive in the memories of many audience members at the time. For explanations of this phenomenon, he quotes pink film director Yutaka Ikejima who theorizes that the sexual fantasies of this generation had been warped by the war experience. Sharp also quotes Japanese film scholar Donald Richie, who asserts that these films are no more than an outlet for the frustrations that males everywhere sometimes feel towards females. Critical appraisal The commercial database Allmovie judges Fairy in a Cage to be one of Nikkatsu's best films in their violent genre. They note that in spite of his usual expertise with lightweight comedies, \\"Ohara's direction is crisp, and torture fans will find much to admire in the Sadean eroticism he brings to the proceedings.\\" In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, the Weissers also rate the film highly, giving it three points out of four. They rank Fairy in a Cage as one of Nikkatsu's best in the genre, as well as one of author Oniroku Dan's better efforts. In his review of Ohara's oeuvre, Graham R. Lewis writes of Fairy in a Cage, \\"Ohara really out-did himself with this one: the period detail is perfect and again all production values and acting are of the highest quality.\\" Jasper Sharp, in his Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema, takes a negative view of Fairy in a Cage. He considers the film intellectually inferior to Tatsumi Kumashiro's Woods Are Wet (1973), which had a similar theme. He writes that Ohara is not one of Nikkatsu's top directors, and that the film, \\"merely wallows in its own depravity, with ever more vicious displays of abuse towards its leading lady.\\" Availability Fairy in a Cage was released theatrically in Japan on June 4, 1977. It was released on VHS in Japan on December 5, 1997.

They wrote a nationally syndicated collectibles column that began in 1955. Ralph Kovel Ralph was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1920. His family moved to Paducah, Kentucky, then Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1930s. He graduated from Cleveland Heights High School, then attended Ohio State University. He joined the United States Coast Guard during World War II. In 1950 he married Terry Horvitz. Their children are Lee Kovel and Kim Kovel. He started his writing career with Terry in 1953 (see section Ralph and Terry Kovel). In the 1950s, he was in the export-import business and imported a variety of things, including the Lambretta motor scooter, the new bikini bathing suits European women were wearing, and specialty food products. He didn't like the constant travel, so he started his own business as a food broker, representing packaged foods and other products to grocery-store chains, and fast-food restaurants. He represented many of the new frozen food lines, like Stouffers, specialty items like Sweet and Low packets, and even live, bare-root fruit trees. Ralph sold McDonald's fresh potatoes in 1956 by the carload when hamburgers were 15 cents and the chain said they would never use frozen French fries. He bought a small salad dressing company in Cleveland named Sar-a-Lee and soon was selling custom-made dressings to major fast-food chains for their newly popular salad bars. In 1987 his company was purchased Sara Lee Corporation. and he became a senior vice president in the foods division. In 1970 Ralph started U.S. Brands, Inc., a fulfillment company that did packaging and handling for the Kovels books and newsletters as well as for many other businesses. He became part owner of an innovative aquaculture shrimp farm in the Bahamas in 1996. Ralph continued working until the week before his final illness. He died in August 2008.

When his children chewed the paper straws in their milkshakes, he developed the first plastic straw for McDonald's by using the outer part of a plastic clothes line. He was a dedicated volunteer, working as a group leader and board member at a settlement house, a volunteer for public television, and a committee member for the Cleveland United Appeal. He even helped plan and cook fundraising spaghetti dinners. Ralph continued working until the week before his final illness.

Books and Other Published Writing The first Kovel (rhymes with \\"oh well\\") book was written in 1952-53. Ralph and Terry were living in an apartment with their young son, Lee (and with a breakfront full of their collection of English 18th-century porcelains). Their daughter, Kim, was born the day the first copy of Ralph and Terry's first book, Dictionary of Marks: Pottery and Porcelain arrived by mail. That book, now titled Kovels' Dictionary of Marks: Pottery and Porcelain, 1650‚Äì1850, is still in print.

In 1953 the Kovels started writing a question and answer column for The Cleveland Press. It was syndicated in 1955 with Register and Tribune Syndicate and was soon running in 100 newspapers. When the Cleveland Press closed in 1982 the Cleveland Plain Dealer began to run the Kovels' column. \\"Kovels: Antiques and Collecting\\" is now (2011) the longest- running U.S. syndicated column written by the original bylined author.

In 1967 The Kovels wrote Kovels' Know Your Antiques, an easy-to-read book for collectors filled with marks, dates, and helpful information. The next year they decided that an up-to-date book listing prices for antiques was needed. They used the newest technology, keypunch cards and that modern invention, the computer. The cards were punched, corrected, sorted by hand (there was no sorting machine), and printed on the white side of green bar paper used for accounting. The system used the only available typeface and no pictures. The white pages were reproduced to create the book, so the time to complete the book was speeded up by six months. It is said to be the first \\"bookstore\\" book done on a computer. The Complete Antiques Price List has been published every year for over 44 years with changes and improvements. The title is now Kovels' Antiques and Collectibles Price Guide.

The game is presented using voxel-based graphics in a 3D environment to emulate the 2D graphics of earlier video games. The game was published in Japan by FromSoftware in November 2009, and in North America and Europe by Atlus USA and SouthPeak Games in May 2010, respectively.  Gameplay  In-game screenshot of 3D Dot Game Heroes The gameplay resembles that of action role-playing games on third generation video game consoles from the 1980s, particularly that of The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy Adventure, and also aesthetically similar to Dragon Warrior. Players move characters from screen to screen exploring dungeons, battling enemies, collecting items and solving puzzles. When the player's health bar is full, the player's sword will grow to tremendous sizes whenever swung. Swords in-game can be customized and leveled up to increase its length, width, as well as magical power, other special items that can also be used include boomerangs, lanterns, candles, and bows. Players can create their own character model using the game's 3D sprite editor. Players are able to collect monsters to be featured in an encyclopedia which is done through beating the monster on its head with a book until its profile shows up in the encyclopedia's pages. Loading screens in-game feature recreated box arts of classic video games using the game's 3D sprites.  Synopsis  The game follows a hero on a quest to rid the Dotnia Kingdom of a dark plague caused by the forces of evil in order to restore peace to the land. Legend tells of an evil king known as the Dark King Onyx who brought tragedy and darkness to the kingdom by stealing six magical orbs. However a hero rose up against the Dark King and with his legendary sword as well as the power of the orbs, he sealed Onyx away within another orb. However, the forces of evil rose again as the Dark Bishop Fuelle stole the orb and threw the Kingdom of Dotnia into a state of chaos once more. The game's main protagonist is the grandchild of the brave hero who sealed away the Dark King and thus is entrusted with the responsibility to save the land. The kingdom was once a 2D pixelated world but as the King of the Land felt that sprites were outdated he thus decreed for the kingdom to make the switch to 3D. This caused the entire world to become 3D while still retaining its original pixelated look.  Development  Silicon Studio developed 3D Dot Game Heroes in just 10 months despite none of the development team having prior experience with PS3 development. The game was actually created as a way to showcase Silicon Studio's middleware technology, and the speed at which development could progress with it. The game was teased by From Software on August 10, 2009 with a teaser site showing a cube and a countdown-timer to August 20, 2009. The game was unveiled before the countdown ended by Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, on August 18, 2009. A North American release of the game was confirmed by the Twitter account of Sony Computer Entertainment America which said that the game was \\"definitely\\" coming to North America. On November 17, 2009 Atlus confirmed that they would be localizing and publishing the game in North America for a May 11, 2010 release.  Reception  The game received a generally positive reception from critics. Famitsu gave the game an 8/8/7/7, a total of 30 out of 40, saying that the gameplay is a huge homage to The Legend of Zelda and there are numerous references to Nintendo Entertainment System games throughout the game, making it a \\"nostalgia-laden trip.\\" Famitsu also praised the graphics saying that the blocky animations are pretty and that they fuse the old with the new seamlessly, also saying that it was a fun and well-made title, though it does not qualify as a new and original game. According to Famitsu magazine, 3D Dot Game Heroes sold 17,300 units in Japan by the end of 2009, making it the 463rd best-selling game of the year in that region. Atlus USA reported in October 2010 that 3D Dot Game Heroes sold 160,000 units, greater than six times the amount they had anticipated.

He wrote the lyrics to Equatorial Guinea's national anthem, Caminemos pisando las sendas de nuestra inmensa felicidad. He was executed in 1969 following a failed coup to depose Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema, the first ruler of an independent Equatorial Guinea. Political career In the period leading up to Equatorial Guinea's independence from Spain, Ndongo led one of the country's major political parties, the Movimiento Nacional de Liberaci√≥n de la Guinea Ecuatorial (MONALIGE). He established the party in 1959 while living in Gabon; as MONALIGE was an African nationalist party that campaigned for Equatoguinean independence, he led the party from abroad due to Spanish suppression of independence movements at the time. After Spain granted Equatorial Guinea independence in 1968, he was defeated by Mac√≠as in the country's first elections; though he became the nation's foreign minister, he remained discontent with the outcome. In March of the following year, Ndongo led a coup against Mac√≠as; the coup failed, leading to Ndongo's execution. Equatorial Guinea's National Anthem Ndongo wrote the lyrics for Equatorial Guinea's National Anthem, Caminemos pisando las sendas de nuestra inmensa felicidad (Let Us Tread the Path of our Immense Happiness), in 1968. The music was composed by Ramiro Sanchez Lopes, who was a Spanish lieutenant and the deputy director of music at the army headquarters located in Madrid; he received 25,000 pesetas for his efforts. Ndongo's anthem was first played on October 12, 1968, Equatorial Guinea's independence day, and was well-received by his countrymen. The lyrics of the anthem were influenced by the end of Equatorial Guinea's colonization, with de-colonization being a main theme.

The prison is located in the village of Flockton (near Wakefield) in West Yorkshire, England. New Hall is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History In 1933, New Hall became the first prison to implement the then-experimental Open Prison system. This was seen as a potential method for dealing with the combined problems of the rising numbers of prisoners and the lack of proper employment for them. At first, the prison was populated by prisoners from HMP Wakefield who were soon due to be released, but in 1961 the prison became a Senior Detention Centre for male young offenders. It was during this time that, on some occasions, the 'Short, sharp shock' regime was introduced. In 1987 the prison was assigned to serve a different population, when it was re-designated for a second time to become a women's prison. In 1999, the BBC programme Jailbirds was filmed at the prison with the producers being given unlimited access to the inmates for a period of eight months. The prison today Currently, New Hall is a closed female local prison which holds all categories of adult female prisoners. Beside this, it caters for young offenders and juveniles who are on Detention and Training Orders. Accommodation at the prison is mainly in cells. There is a mother & baby unit, health care centre, segregation unit and some dormitories. This prison provides full and part-time education courses for prisoners in areas such as business administration, food hygiene, literacy, numeracy and information technology, NVQ Hairdressing, BTEC and Art. New Hall has workshops where inmates can be given experience of assembly work, light textile work, catering and gardening.

It overlooks the river which flows through Prizren, which developed around the fortress. The site of the fortress of Prizren has seen habitation and use since the Bronze Age (ca. 2000). In late antiquity it was part of the defensive fortification system in western Dardania and was reconstructed in the era of eastern Roman Emperor Justinian. Byzantine rule in the region ended definitively in 1219‚Äì20 as the Serbian Nemanjiƒá dynasty controlled the fort until 1371. Since 1371, a series of regional feudal rulers came to control Prizren and its fort: the Bal≈°iƒá, the Dukagjini, the Hrebeljanoviƒá and finally the Brankoviƒá, often with Ottoman support. The Ottoman Empire assumed direct control after 1450 and over time turned the fort into a central stronghold in the Eyalet of Rumelia. Much of the modern fortress dates to the 18th century reconstruction phase. The fortress is situated on a dominant hill at the eastern part of the town of Prizren, set on a strategic position, contoured with lines that follow distinguished features of the terrain's natural morphology. Archaeological excavations were carried out in 1969 and then again in 2004 and 2009‚Äì2011. They resulted in the discovery of the infrastructure, which incorporates rampart walls enforced with towers, casemates, labyrinth corridors, depots, and other accompanying inner rooms and dwellings. It was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1948.  Name  The Prizren fortress is named Kalaja e Prizrenit in Albanian and Prizrenska Kaljaja in Serbian. Both names come from the Turkish word kale (fortress) by which it was known in Ottoman times. The historical neighbourhood which formed around the lower part of the fortress is named N√´nkalaja (literally \\"below the fortress\\").  History  Forts and settlements in late antiquity and medieval Kosovo Prizren has been traditionally identified with Theranda, a town of the Roman era. Another location which may have been that of Theranda is present-day Suhareka Archaeological research has shown that the site of the fortress has passed several eras of habitation since prehistoric times. In its lower part, material from the upper part of the fort has been deposited over the centuries. It dates from the Bronze Age (c. 2000 BCE) to the late Iron Age (c. 1st century CE) and is comparable to the material found in the nearby prehistoric site in the village of Vlashnj√´. In late antiquity, the fortification saw a phase of reconstruction. It is part of a series of forts that were built or reconstructed in the same period by Justinian along the White Drin in northern Albania and western Kosovo in the routes that linked the coastal areas with the Kosovo valley. At this time, the Prizren fortress likely appears in historical record as Petrizen in the 6th century CE in the work of Procopius as one of the fortifications which Justinian commissioned to be reconstructed in Dardania. Present-day Prizren is first mentioned in 1019 at the time of Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025) in the form of Prisdriana.In 1072, the leaders of the Bulgarian Uprising of Georgi Voiteh traveled from their center in Skopje in the area of Prizren and held a meeting in which they invited Mihailo Vojislavljeviƒá of Duklja to send them assistance. Mihailo sent his son, Constantine Bodin with 300 of his soldiers. Dalassenos Doukas, dux of Bulgaria was sent against the combined forced but was defeated near Prizren, which was extensively plundered by the Serbian army after the battle. The Bulgarian magnates proclaimed Bodin \\"Emperor of the Bulgarians\\" after this initial victory. They were defeated by Nikephoros Bryennios in the area of northern Macedonia by the end of 1072. Demetrios Chomatenos is the last Byzantine archbishop of Ohrid to include Prizren in his jurisdiction until 1219. Stefan Nemanja had seized the surrounding area along the White Drin in 1185‚Äì95 and the ecclesiastical split from the Patriarchate in 1219 was the final act of establishing Nemanjiƒá rule in the town. Prizren and its fort were the administrative and economic center of the ≈æupa of Podrimlje (in Albanian, Podrima or Anadrini). In the Middle Ages, the Prizren fortress was part of the fortifications of the Via de Zenta trade route which passed through the Drin valley and connected the Adriatic coastline with the central Balkans. In a nearby location, roughly 3 km to the southeast of the Prizren fortress, Stefan Du≈°an commissioned the building of the Monastery of the Holy Archangels and the Vi≈°egrad fort, which is also known as Du≈°anov grad. For a time, they were the fortifications of his court in Prizren before he moved it to Skopje. The v√°ros (n√´nkalaja - old town) of Prizren developed around the fortress. Ragusan traders were stationed in the old town. Prizren over time became a trading hub and gateway for Ragusan trade towards eastern Kosovo and beyond. Prizren became part of the Ottoman Empire after 1450 until the First Balkan War (1912). The present-day fortress is largely the product of Ottoman expansion and reconstruction in the 18th century. During the Ottoman occupation of Serbia, Serbs held social gatherings at several monumental places, such as Kaljaja, where they danced the Kolo in the evening.Serbian Folk Dance Tradition in Prizren Ethnomusicology, Vol. 6, No. 2 (May, 1962)  Gallery  Kaljaja1.jpg|Main Gate Kaljaja4.jpg|The remains of one of the towers Prizren, Kalaja e vjeter 09.jpg|Part of the - now reconstructed - upper part of the fortress  See also  *Late Antiquity and Medieval sites in Kosovo *List of fortresses in Kosovo *List of fortresses in Serbia *Tourism in Kosovo References Sources     Annotations {style=\\"margin- left:13px; line-height:150%\\" |align=\\"right\\" valign=\\"top\\"|a. } External links Category:Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance (Serbia) Category:Buildings and structures in Prizren Category:Monuments and memorials in Kosovo Category:Medieval Serbian sites in Kosovo Category:Former capitals of Serbia Category:Forts in Kosovo Category:Forts in Serbia Category:Byzantine forts Category:Stefan Du≈°an ","title":"Prizren Fortress"},{"id":"24378738","text":"Nikolai Ivanovich Fiyev (; born 7 May 1982) is a former Russian professional football player.

Later, on 10 February 1936, Kivim√§ki reported his private conversation with Assmus to J.K. Paasikivi: > \\"in case Germany starts a war to any direction, Russia is forced to > annihilate Finland to defuse it.

History Heerema Marine Contractors was formed in 1948 by Pieter Shelte Heerema as a small construction company providing oilfield platforms in Venezuela. In the 1960s the company focused on the North Sea offshore developments. The company developed crane vessels to lift large offshore platforms and modules. The ship shaped crane vessel Challenger was equipped to lift 800 t. The need for large stable crane vessels to operate in the North Sea environment lead the company to develop the first large semi-submersible crane vessels. In 1978, HMC commissioned Mitsui to construct the two sister semi-submersible crane vessels, and SSCV Hermod. These vessel could lift 5,400 tonnes with the twin cranes, and were later upgraded to 8,200 tonnes. In 1988 HMC formed a joint venture with McDermott called HeereMac. \\"Thialf\\" in a Norway fjord The was added to the Heeremac fleet, and upon the split of the companies in December 1997, Heerema took ownership of the Thialf, the largest deep water construction vessel and is capable of a tandem lift of 14,200 t (15,600 short tons) The was affected by a flooding incident in 2006 and was put out of service for a few months.

The episode premiered on the Fox network on September 16, 2009. It was directed by John Scott and written by series creator Ryan Murphy. The episode sees glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) form an all-male a cappella group, the Acafellas, neglecting the club in favor of dedicating his time to the new endeavor. New Directions struggle with choreography, and resist attempts at sabotage by members of the cheer squad. Mercedes (Amber Riley) harbors romantic feelings for Kurt (Chris Colfer), who comes out as homosexual. Singer Josh Groban guest stars as himself, John Lloyd Young appears as wood shop teacher Henri St. Pierre, and Victor Garber and Debra Monk play Will's parents. The episode features covers of seven songs, including the instrumental piece \\"La Camisa Negra\\" performed on guitar by Mark Salling. Studio recordings of two of the songs performed were released as singles, available for digital download, and two of the tracks also appear on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1. The episode was watched by 6.69 million US viewers and received mixed reviews from critics. Entertainment Weekly's Tim Stack and The New York Times's Mike Hale welcomed the return of Stephen Tobolowsky as Sandy Ryerson, while Ryan Brockington of the New York Post and Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal praised Riley's cover of Jazmine Sullivan's \\"Bust Your Windows\\". However, Rachel Ray, reviewing the episode for The Independent, deemed it \\"overhyped [...] uninspired, confusing and with a simple plot to boot.\\" Plot When Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) questions director Will Schuester's choreography skills during a glee club rehearsal, he forms an all-male a cappella group, the Acafellas, to build his confidence. The group originally consists of Will, football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher), woodshop teacher Henri St. Pierre (John Lloyd Young) and Howard Bamboo (Kent Avenido), a co-worker of Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig). After their first performance however, Henri and Howard drop out and Will replaces them with glee club member Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), who was considering quitting glee club, and his fellow football player Puck (Mark Salling). Former glee club director Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) also joins the group, having arranged for singer Josh Groban to be at their next performance. Although the star compliments their rendition of \\"I Wanna Sex You Up\\", he reveals that he only attended to make sure Sandy stopped stalking him. In Will's absence, the glee club hires Dakota Stanley (Whit Hertford), the choreographer of a rival club, Vocal Adrenaline, to help coach them to a Nationals championship. Cheerleaders Quinn (Dianna Agron), Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) hope that the notoriously harsh Stanley will prompt some members of the club to quit, furthering their plan to sabotage the club. Although Stanley is heavily critical of most of the group, Rachel convinces the members that their differences give them a unique edge, and fires the choreographer. The cheerleaders also lead Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) to believe that fellow club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) has feelings for her, despite Rachel and Tina Cohen-Chang‚Äôs efforts to inform Mercedes that Kurt is obviously gay. Mercedes is hurt when Kurt rejects her advances. He misleads her into believing he has feelings for Rachel, which angers Mercedes, and she breaks the windshield of his car and sings \\"Bust Your Windows\\". Kurt later confesses to her that he is gay‚Äîthe first time he has said it to anyone‚Äîand the two make up. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is angry that the club is now stronger than ever, and punishes Quinn and Santana. Quinn retaliates by thanking Sue for helping her realize that believing in herself negates the need to bring other people down. Will realizes that his passion is teaching, not performing, and resolves to recommit to the glee club. Production Recurring cast members who appear in \\"Acafellas\\" are Stephen Tobolowsky as former glee club director Sandy Ryerson, Patrick Gallagher as football coach Ken Tanaka, Iqbal Theba as Principal Figgins, Kent Avenido as Sheets and Things employee Howard Bamboo, and Naya Rivera and Heather Morris as glee club members Santana Lopez and Brittany Pierce. Whit Hertford guest-starred as choreographer Dakota Stanley. Cheyenne Jackson was originally supposed to play Dakota Stanley, but when he arrived in California he learned that he had the flu. John Lloyd Young played Henri, \\"a retired wood shop teacher with an excellent singing voice\\", and Victor Garber and Debra Monk played Will's parents. Morrison was \\"thrilled\\" by Garber's casting, having been a longstanding fan of his. Josh Groban received special guest star billing, playing, in Colfer's words, \\"himself as this ignorant asshole\\". Morrison's rapping in the episode was an already acquired skill, with Gilsig commenting: \\"He can do it. It didn't look like a joke, it actually looked totally authentic, and he was fantastic. I think he has just an amazing musical range. People like that who have been singing their whole lives, they have such a command of that.\\" Riley deemed Kurt's coming out in the episode \\"very emotional\\" and \\"one of [her] favorite scenes\\". Colfer described the scene as \\"very respectful and very touching ... very, very real and serious.\\" Music The episode features cover versions of \\"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\\", \\"This Is How We Do It\\" by Montell Jordan, \\"Poison\\" by Bell Biv DeVoe, \\"Mercy\\" by Duffy, \\"Bust Your Windows\\" by Jazmine Sullivan, \\"I Wanna Sex You Up\\" by Color Me Badd and an instrumental performance of \\"La Camisa Negra\\" by Juanes. Studio recordings of \\"Bust Your Windows\\" and \\"Mercy\\" were released as singles, available for digital download. \\"Bust Your Windows\\" is also featured on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 1, with a studio recording of \\"I Wanna Sex You Up\\" included as a bonus track on discs purchased from Target. Reception Ratings Mike Hale of The New York Times named Josh Groban's cameo appearance the highlight of the episode. \\"Acafellas\\" was watched by 6.69 million US viewers and attained a 3.2/9 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. It was the tenth most watched show in Canada for the week, with 1.44 million viewers. In the UK, the episode was shown straight after the pilot episode, and was watched by 1.68 million viewers (1.29 million on E4, and 398,000 on timeshift), becoming the most-watched show on cable for the week. Critical reception The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly reviewed the episode positively, deeming it potentially even better than the season premiere. Stack wrote that the best aspect of the episode was the focus placed on previously more minor characters, such as Puck, Mercedes and Kurt. He praised Lynch as Sue and wrote, \\"Stephen Tobolowsky‚Äôs Sandy is also becoming one of the most reliable characters for great lines and laughs.\\" He was disappointed that Garber did not sing in his role as Will's father, but hoped he would return for future episodes. Ryan Brockington for the New York Post stated that \\"the key to this show lies directly within the female leads\\", praising Michele as Rachel, Agron as Quinn and Riley as Mercedes, noting that in \\"Acafellas\\", Riley \\"finally got a chance to shine\\". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal praised Riley's rendition of \\"Bust Your Windows\\" as \\"showstopping\\", Vocal Adrenaline's \\"Mercy\\" as \\"leg-splits-over-shoulders exciting\\", and deemed the Acafellas performance of \\"I Wanna Sex You Up\\" \\"corny\\" but noted: \\"this is about high school. Corny is de rigueur.\\" Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times wrote that although \\"Bust Your Windows\\" was \\"over the top [...] the emotion behind the whole thing felt appropriately real.\\" Mike Hale of The New York Times was critical of the episode, discussing the show's \\"increasingly rapid march toward Hallmark country.\\" He commented that while \\"Acafellas\\" did not match the standard of the pilot episode, it was funnier than \\"Showmance\\", and praised the return of Stephen Tobolowsky as Sandy Ryerson. Hale called Groban's cameo the \\"most fun of all\\" in the episode, but overall noted that: \\"The humor can‚Äôt make up for the lack of big production numbers [...] The problem for this show is always going to be how to fill the gaps between songs. A lot of the current plot lines, like Will and his wife's phantom baby, are already getting old, so it would behoove the producers to keep those gaps as short as possible.\\" Rachel Ray, reviewing the episode for The Independent deemed Glee \\"overhyped [...] uninspired, confusing and with a simple plot to boot.\\" Ray wrote, Glee \\"upbeat message\\" was \\"overridden by the show's attempt to be darker than the run-of- the mill high school drama.\\" As with Hale, Ray commented that: \\"Music should be the redeeming feature of Glee but it's not, because the viewer never gets a satisfying taste of the cast members' musical talents\\". Shawna Malcom criticized Terri and Will's characterization in the episode, deeming Terri \\"beyond annoying\\", but wrote: \\"I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig‚Äôs character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step.\\" Of Will, Malcom posed the question: \\"didn‚Äôt it feel as though his commitment to the glee club melted away rather quickly? [...] How could he turn his back so easily?\\" More positively, Malcom called Kurt's coming out scene \\"lovely\\". She wrote that Groban's appearance was \\"laugh out loud\\" funny, while Stack commented: \\"It was a little random, but it's all worth it for the scene when Groban was hitting on Will's mom.\\" References External links * \\"Acafellas\\" at Fox.com  \\"Acafellas\\" at TV.com Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Glee (season 1) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Ryan Murphy (writer) ","title":"Acafellas"},{"id":"24378824","text":"The Cosmonaut (El Cosmonauta) is a Spanish science-fiction film, directed by Nicol√°s Alcal√° and produced by Carola Rodr√≠guez and Bruno Teixidor. It premiered in May 2013. The first feature-length project of Riot Cinema Collective is notable for its use of crowdfunding and Creative Commons license in its production. Plot In 1967, two young friends, Stas and Andrei, arrive to the newly built Star City (near Moscow) where the first cosmonauts trained to go into space, and where a race against the clock to beat the Americans into space takes place. Stas and Andrei will witness first-hand the political plots, the fights for power and the successes and failures of the Soviet Union in some of the greatest achievements of the 20th century. They will meet Yulia, a communications technician, with whom they will strike up a strong friendship, always close to love but never consummated. Influences The main influences behind The Cosmonaut's conception and filmmaking approach are the works of some of the world's most renowned filmmakers. The project's dossier mentions specifically the names of Wong Kar- wai (and his main cinematographer, Christopher Doyle), Andrei Tarkovsky, Jos√© Luis Guer√≠n, and Robert Bresson, among others. There are many links especially to Andrei Tarkovsky's body of work either thematically (the main themes of the films of memory, lost love, and reality), or plot-related (the film's two main characters, Andrei and Stas Arsenievich, share Andrei Tarkovsky's name and patronymic, respectively). These ties are more evident through a look in the collaborators‚Äô list: among others, the names of Eduard Artemyev, and Marina Tarkovskaya (Tarkovky's sister). The fictional Program K, whose hummingbird icon is one of the main images used in the project's promotion, and which also gives its name to the virtual community of producers of the film, is based on the real Soviet projects that attempted to place a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. Production The idea behind The Cosmonaut emerged from two main sources: a) the conversations between Nicol√°s Alcal√° and Bruno Teixidor (the main creative minds behind the project's visual looks) about conspiracies, the Lost Cosmonauts theories and the Soviet space program; and b) the poetry book Poetics for Cosmonauts, written by Henry Pierrot. Throughout the time it was developed, the main plot core underwent a lot of changes, although some key elements remained through all the process, mainly the principal plot element (the return of an astronaut to Earth after a long trip to the Moon). After the reading of Poetics for Cosmonauts, the script changed to its present form. The preproduction for the short film started in October‚ÄìNovember 2008. 2009 In January 2009, the project underwent its most radical changes: the film went from being a short film released and produced in a traditional way, to a feature-length film funded through Crowdfunding and released for free under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. Crowdfunding Inspired by productions such as A Swarm of Angels and Artemis Eternal, The Cosmonaut is the first Spanish feature film that makes use of the crowdfunding financing method. There were two ways to get involved in The Cosmonaut‚Äôs production: * First, as a regular producer. From an initial contribution of 2 euros, a contributor may be listed as a ‚Äúproducer‚Äù in the film credits, receiving a welcome pack, and a ticket for the drawing of one of the cosmonauts‚Äô suits that will be used in the film. Further investments could be used to buy merchandising items in the film's online store. * Secondly, as a movie investor. From an initial investment of 100 euros, a contributor can own a percentage of the film's profits. Being a cinematographic project whose spread is based mostly in the use of social networks, and synergy between audience and creators, the network material of the movie is centered mostly in the creation of a fan community. Producers, regardless of their monetary participation in the film, form part of Programme K, a social group in which they can relate between each other, follow the development of the film, and take advantage of special perks and draws for Programme K members. Release The film, when finished, will be released on the Internet available for download and in HD. Also, besides the full movie on HD, all raw footage shot during the movie's filming will be uploaded too. As the film is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License, the users will be able to download, lend, re-cut or use the film footage in any way they wish. This way, the audience not only will be allowed, but also encouraged by the producers themselves, to create new versions of the film and other derivative works. 2010 Between December 2009 and June 2010, the Riot Cinema team worked in modernizing the previous business model. On 2 June 2010, the new model, called ‚ÄúThe Plan‚Äù, was launched in a press conference by the people in charge of the company. It provides the project with some developments. These developments increase the project approach and infrastructure, keeping its previous features, but, in general, taking them a step further. Crowdfunding and financing A totally new funding plan is introduced in the business model. While in the old model the film funding was through crowdfunding and private investment, in ‚ÄúThe Plan‚Äù, a three-staged progressive plan is detailed, in which there is room for private financing, crowdfunding, sponsorization, and distribution presales. Even though the new three-staged model (in which the first stage would be the first year of the project) keeps crowdfunding and private investment as funding means, their role in the project varies: economically, crowdfunding carries less weight than in the first draft of the project. Nevertheless, its use is kept due to the weight such a completely developed infrastructure has in keeping and strengthening a fan community. Regarding private investment, it keeps the same operational system, but the owned profits per invested money ratio vary depending on the project stage. According to Riot Cinema data, of the ‚Ç¨860,000 the project will cost, it is expected that 6.5% be financed through crowdfunding and/or merchandising, 21% by private investment, 32% through sponsorship, and 40.5% through presales distribution (approximate figures). Yuri's Night One of the examples of the application of the new sponsorship option was available in the party carried out during the 2010 Yuri's Night. Since Yuri Gagarin is a kind of mascot of the project, the people in charge of the film worked in collaboration with LEEM for months in order to join the world initiatives celebrated in Yuri's Night. It also happened to celebrate the achievement of 2000 producers of the film. Distribution and transmedia In the same way, the movie distribution model has also changed. The project has suffered more noticeable changes in its distribution channels and in the final completion of the project. Regarding distribution, the new plan's objective is the simultaneous premiere in all release windows. The philosophy behind this decision is to allow the user to choose the format he wants to watch the movie. Different particularities have been adopted for each release window, taking each mean into account, but making some changes in the traditional way of distribution. For instance, the release on the Internet will still be totally free and in HD, while the TV release will have an alternative ending for that channel. In the same way, the people in charge of the movie have designed a special presentation in cinemas to encourage people to go the theaters. This is called ‚ÄúThe Cosmonaut Experience‚Äù, and it merges performance elements with recreational interaction with the audience, classic screening and a traveling tour, in order to provide the audience, according to the creators, with an added \\"experience\\". This tour of screenings will not replace the traditional screening in cinemas, but it will be done at the same time. The Cosmonaut, regarding its current completion, is no longer a science fiction feature film. Following the steps of franchises such as The Matrix or Lost, The Cosmonaut will be a transmedia project with ramifications in different fields. It is planned to make a series of webisodes, mobile content, or even an ARG, among others. Each series of content will show its own perspective of a story included in the film. It won't be necessary to watch them in order to understand the given facts, but it will provide some data and information about The Cosmonaut world that will complement each other. 2011 An update of the business model (\\"The Plan 2\\") was presented in October 2011, once shooting was finished. The Cosmonaut is one of the most successful crowdfunding projects in history with about ‚Ç¨300,000. Save The Cosmonaut After having raised ‚Ç¨120,000 during the first two years, the decision was taken to shoot with that money together with ‚Ç¨120,000 more contributed by a Russian co-producer. One week before shooting, when all the tickets were purchased and all the reservations made, the co-producer had to withdraw. A desperate campaign was then launched requesting the community to help save the movie. More than 600 people contributed a total of ‚Ç¨131,000 in 3 days, beating all the world crowdfunding records in such a short period of time, and allowing the film to be shot. With such a huge success, the possibility of investing was kept during the entirety of shooting. A streaming window was created so the investors could watch the shooting they had made possible live. L√°nzanos, the Spanish crowdfunding platform that collaborated during the whole campaign, faced, together with The Cosmonaut's team, what they called \\"their most beautiful failure of design\\": the raising status bar exceeded 173%, going beyond the box it was embedded in. The same happened on the film website. Media coverage and reception After over a year of promotion, the project has received certain degree of attention from the national media in Spain. There have been reports about the film in various of the non-\\"pay per view\\" television channels of the country: TVE, in the news program of LaSexta, CNN+ and Cuatro, and in a divulgative program of La 2. [20]; as well as in different newspapers, magazines and radios: El Pa√≠s, El Mundo, ABC, P√∫blico, AND, La Gaceta, Fotogramas, Cadena Ser, los 40 Principales. We can also find among these the Spanish edition of Cahiers du Cinema. The main coverage of the project, however, came through the Internet. A great quantity of blogs and web based media dedicated articles to the film, between them some of the most influential blogs of Spain. Some examples of this include the digital version of El Pa√≠s, the daily newspaper with the biggest print run in the country, or Microsiervos, one of the most visited blogs in Spanish. The media reaction wasn't limited to Spain: some English- speaking blogs wrote about the project as well. CosmoNauts concert Most of the media attention towards the project was generated after a two-day music festival. The festival, named \\"CosmoNauts\\", was announced in The Cosmonaut blog on 9 June 2009. It was organized as a mass event to promote the film; during two days (29 and 30 June), nine bands belonging to the indie scene of Madrid played in front of an audience that, according to the organization, reached 400 people between the two days, with the emerging filmmaker Nacho Vigalondo as the master of ceremonies. The concert, held in Madrid in the Sala Heineken, wasn't able to fill the seating capacity of the concert hall, mainly due to schedule hardships (the concert was held in the middle of a working week, and at the end of the month), and the organization's inexperience. While it was a mild economic failure, the organizers of the concert ascribe the subsequent promotional success of the movie and the later peak of sales in the online store to the festival, and, therefore, consider it a success. Travelling at zero gravity The Cosmonaut team, in collaboration with Improba Spain (the collective of followers of Improv Everywhere in Spain), carried out a promotional flashmob on 29 January 2010, in Puerta del Sol, Madrid. The object of the event was to simulate a moon landing in downtown Madrid, and it had a remarkable attendance, even some of the passers-by joined the performance.  Controversy  The crowdfunding movie project The Cosmonaut has suffered a serious PR drawback due to a public relationship problem related to the director and writer, Nicol√°s Alcal√°. In his response (which he made public) to a resume from a man named \\"Carlos\\", Alcal√° made some very peculiar remarks about the structure of the email and its purpose. Thus, with the intention of humiliating this man, he made comments, such as: \\"If you are a fishmonger, tell us, we have a job for you.\\" (It can be read in Spanish here.) Spanish social media responded very harshly to the public comment, with multiple reactions across the web, and thousands of angry responses on their blogs, leading to a public declaration from the director where he made a public apology for his comments.

Life The second son of Thomas Turner, Dean of Canterbury, he was born at Bristol on 19 or 20 September 1645; he was a younger brother of Francis Turner. Thomas originally matriculated at Hart Hall on 10 May 1662, but on 6 October 1663 he was admitted to a Gloucestershire scholarship at Corpus, of which he became fellow in 1672. He graduated B.A. on 15 March 1666, M.A. in 1669, B.D. in 1677, and D.D. in 1683. From 1672 to 1695 he was vicar of Milton, near Sittingbourne, Kent, and from 1680 to 1689 rector of Thorley, Hertfordshire. He became rector of Fulham, Middlesex, in 1688, archdeacon of Essex in 1680, canon of Ely in 1686, canon of St Paul's Cathedral in 1682, and precentor in 1690. These preferments, except the sinecure rectory of Fulham and the canonry and precentorship of St. Paul's, he resigned at or shortly after his election to the presidency of Corpus on 13 March 1688. The rapid election, which took place within a week of the death of his predecessor Robert Newlyn, diminished the chance of any interference from the court of James II. Turner reformed the college and spent his own money on it. In 1706 he began what are now the Fellows' buildings, to a design attributed to Henry Aldrich. They were completed in 1712. Turner died on 29 April 1714, and is buried in the college chapel, where, as also at Stowe Nine Churches in Northamptonshire, there is a lengthy inscription about his bequests. These included a major benefaction to the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy. Turner was, from the hints of Thomas Hearne, suspected of Jacobite sympathies, but on very slender grounds. His publication was a sermon preached at Whitehall on 29 May 1685 before James II, to whom he was chaplain. In this sermon there is criticism of Thomas Hobbes's position, that a 'state of nature is a state of war.'

Hypnosis and dreaming are specifically referred to in the lyrics, and Welch also draws upon references to places such as Mexico and North Carolina. According to Welch, the atmosphere of the song was heavily influenced by his residence at the Benifold Mansion in Hampshire, England, a place he described as \\"rather spooky and strange even in summertime\\". In 1978 the song was covered by the Pointer Sisters on their album Energy.Second Hand Songs Reception Donald Brackett, in his 2007 book Fleetwood Mac, 40 Years of Creative Chaos, discussed the album Mystery To Me and the song \\"Hypnotized\\" which he described as \\"a gentle yet compelling hit for Welch on this record\\". In discussing Fleetwood Mac's change in direction in 1972 and 1973, he describes their stylistic changes as being better received at concerts in the United States, as at the time Americans were more open to them than the British who were still in heavy demand for blues-oriented rock. Hal Horowitz describes the song as \\"the highlight of the Mystery to Me album, and undoubtedly one of Bob Welch's most fully realized songs for the band\\".

It was nominated in the Best British Documentary category for the British Independent Film Awards 2008. It follows seven participants of the 2007 No Mind Festivalhttp://en.angsbacka.se/event/no-mind-festival/ at √Ñngsbacka,http://en.angsbacka.se a course center located in Molkom, Sweden. This yearly New Age event lasts one or two weeks, has a thousand participants, and is claimed to be the largest alternative festival in Northern Europe. The activities shown in the film include tree hugging (each one choosing his own tree), firewalking, nude swimming, sweat lodge, hugging, Tantric sex, singing, dancing, talks in \\"sharing circles\\". There is also an exercise in defending oneself against a physical attack using psychic energy. The portrayed participants are: *Siddhartha, a Swedish harbor master, who says he feels like a king in his nice house, but also that he is lonely, and longs for a woman. *Peter, who has come with his two sons; his wife did not come along. *Mervi, an older, female former career counselor from Finland. She suffers from a lack of saliva, but some activities are so exciting that it is produced. In the psychic energy exercise, she is knocked over, and the instructor claims that she failed to defend herself with the energy. *Ljus, an American hippie, and a former goatherd. *Regina Lund, a well-known singer/songwriter; she arrives one day later, because she had to sing at a wedding, and leaves earlier. *Marit, a shy Norwegian woman. On one occasion she reveals her hidden fantasy of being a queen; at her request the others one by one bow to her. *Nick, an Australian rugby coach who explains that he expected a different kind of festival; a female journalist friend suggested he attend while she would be there writing a story about the festival. He is very skeptical at first, describing the festival as a cult, but evolves into an enthusiastic participant. He teaches the group some Australian expressions, pronounced in the Australian way, such as \\"no worries\\". Production Three Miles North of Molkom is a low-budget film. Permission to film at the festival came only four weeks in advance. The crew consisted of the two directors and two camera men. Use is made of a Fig Rig. While other groups at the festival are formed at random, this group consisted of people willing and accepted to be in the film. Six of the seven participants were selected during the first six hours of the festival. Nick initially did not care whether he was filmed or not, he just wanted to hang out with the crew because to him they were the closest thing to normality around him. Regina Lund, who had announced that she was interested, was accepted after her arrival on the second day. 150 hours of film was shot. There was no time to watch the rushes during the festival.

A right-handed batsman, he usually fields as a wicket-keeper and has represented England in Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket. He served as vice-captain of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, becoming world champions for the first time in their history. He currently plays for Lancashire in English domestic cricket having previously played for Somerset. He also plays for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Buttler holds the record for the fastest ODI century by an England player and is regarded as one of the best wicket-keeper batsmen in the world. Buttler's ability to recognise and manipulate field placements of opposing teams and score all around the ground has seen him labelled as a \\"360-degree\\" cricketer. Buttler enjoyed a prolific cricket record while at school, sharing a record-breaking opening partnership while at King's College, Taunton in 2008. The following season, his school lost only one of seventeen matches under his captaincy and he was named 2010 Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year. He made his Somerset first-team debut in 2009 after having played age-group cricket for the county. His performances led him to be selected to play for England at Under-19 level before he made his senior England debut in 2011 and his Test debut in 2014. Early life Born in Taunton, Somerset, on 8 September 1990, Buttler was educated at King's College, where he displayed his early talent in cricket. Domestic career Youth career Buttler played extensively for Somerset's youth teams, appearing at Under-13, Under-15 and Under-17 level. He made his senior club cricket debut for Cheddar before moving to Glastonbury in the 2006 season, aged just 15, taking three catches and 15 runs as wicket- keeper. Later in the same season, he made his first appearance for Somerset Second XI, scoring 71 in the second-innings, and taking six catches in the three-day match against Nottinghamshire Second XI. Playing for King's College, he finished the 2006 season with the school's leading batting average, scoring 447 runs at an average of 49.66. The following season he played regularly for Glastonbury in the West of England Premier League, and for Somerset Under-17s, for whom he scored two centuries; an unbeaten 119 during a two-day match against Surrey Under-17s, and 110 against Sussex Under-17s. He once again led the batting averages for King's College, with his 358 runs coming at 51.14. alt=A young man with light brown hair is standing on some grass. He is wearing a burgundy, grey and black cricket uniform, large gloves and black trousers covered by black think pads on his lower legs. The highlight of his school career came in April 2008, when he scored 227 not out during a record-breaking opening stand in a 50-over national schools game, adding 340 with Alex Barrow. He captained King's during the 2008 season, and improved on his batting totals from the previous two years, scoring 851 runs, over 250 more than any other member of the team. His batting average of 94.55 was the sixth highest amongst all school's batsmen reported in Wisden, while his high-score of 227* was the highest score they recorded. During that 2008 season, Buttler also played for Somerset Second XI. With captain Carl Gazzard keeping wicket in the majority of these matches, Buttler played purely as a batsman, although in his final match of the season for the team, he kept wicket and took six catches in the first-innings against Worcestershire Second XI. In the previous match, against Hampshire Second XI, Buttler had made 140 batting from number four. He made his first-class debut for Somerset in September 2009, replacing the injured Justin Langer for the County Championship match against Lancashire, scoring 30 in his only innings. He retained his place in the team for the following Pro40 match against Hampshire, making his List A debut, although he was not required to bat. Selected as part of the Somerset squad for the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, Buttler made his debut in the 20-over format of the game in Somerset's final match of the league stage, remaining six not out at the close of the innings. Buttler again captained King's in 2009, and in the seventeen matches under his leadership they lost only once, and also won the Western School Twenty20 competition. Coupled with his 554 runs for the school at an average of 61.55, and his performances for Somerset, he was named 2010 Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year. First-team opportunity alt=A young man with light brown hair is standing on some grass.

When Craig Kieswetter was called up into the England one-day side in 2010, Buttler was given the chance of a prolonged run in Somerset's first team. Brian Rose, Somerset's Director of Cricket, chose not to bring in an experienced keeper to deputise, explaining that Kieswetter had been in a similar position three years earlier and that he had good reports of Buttler's ability. In his first match of the 2010 season, Buttler remained 22 not out at the close of Somerset's innings, posting his first runs in List A cricket, and he followed this up with two catches to help Somerset beat Glamorgan in their opening Clydesdale Bank 40 fixture. He made his maiden first-class century in his fourth County Championship match, scoring 144 runs in an innings characterised by \\"dogged determination and [a] decent range of shots\\". In his next match, he scored his debut List A half- century against Sussex. Buttler joined James Hildreth at the crease with Somerset at 109/4, requiring 183 more runs to win off 129 balls. The pair put on a partnership of 158 runs \\"to turn the game on its head\\", with Buttler making 69 in 53 balls. In doing so, they set a new record partnership for the fifth-wicket against Sussex. His continued good batting form, which also saw him make scores of 52 and 31* in a County Championship match against Yorkshire, saw him retain his place in the Somerset team upon Kieswetter's return. Buttler was named Man of the Match in Somerset's 2010 Friends Provident T20 semi-final victory over Nottinghamshire at the Rose Bowl, reaching a \\"breathtaking\\" half-century from 21 balls to score an unbeaten 55 runs in a partnership of 75 with Kieron Pollard.McGlashan, Andrew (14 August 2010) Trescothick and Buttler lead Somerset to the final, CricInfo.

England career 2008‚Äì10: England youth career Buttler's first taste of international cricket came in July 2008, when he represented England Under-17s in two warm-up matches against New Zealand Under-19s. Batting at number five, he scored a rapid 77 not out in the 50-over contest, hitting 11 fours and two sixes during the 49 deliveries he faced. He also played in the two-day match between the two teams, scoring 45 in the first-innings as the match was drawn. In 2009, Buttler played four matches for England Under-18s, two each against Scotland A and Scotland Development XI. He scored 103 not out in the first of these matches, and made starts in each of the following matches, reaching double figures on each occasion, but not scoring higher than 28. Two months later, Buttler made his England Under-19 debut, appearing in the first T20 against Bangladesh Under-19s. Playing as a specialist batsman, he scored 33 runs off 17 balls as England won by five wickets. During the 2009‚Äì10 English winter, Buttler toured with the England Under-19 team. He joined up with the squad in Bangladesh following Somerset's elimination from the Champions League Twenty20 for the seven-match youth One Day International (ODI) series, playing again as a specialist batsman.

He scored his maiden ODI century against Sri Lanka at Lord's in May, scoring 121 in 61 balls with nine fours and four sixes, the then-fastest century by any England batsman. During the fifth ODI of the series at Edgbaston, Buttler was controversially 'Mankaded' by Sachithra Senanayake, leading to tension between the sides. England captain Alastair Cook expressed his disappointment, stating: \\"I've never seen it before in a game. I was pretty disappointed. If he was properly trying to steal the single then I could possibly understand it. But he was half a yard out of his crease.\\". After first choice wicket- keeper Matt Prior stood down after injury on 22 July 2014, Buttler was called up for the England squad for the third Test against India. He made 85 runs from 83 balls in his first Test innings. He played in the final three Tests of the series before reverting to one-day duty, touring Sri Lanka at the end of the year. 2015‚Äì17: World Cup, Ashes series, UAE and tour of Bangladesh After playing for England in the Tri-series in Australia at the start of the year, Buttler was once again involved with England at an international tournament, playing in the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. He scored an unbeaten 39 in 19 balls against Sri Lanka and made 65 against Bangladesh but ultimately England lost both matches in a disastrous campaign, failing to progress beyond the group stages. Later in the English winter he was called back into the Test side, as wicket-keeper, during the tour of the West Indies. He continued in the role throughout the English summer, playing both Tests against New Zealand and all five Ashes Tests against Australia. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Geoffrey Boycott, who stated: He continued to play one-day cricket alongside his Test role, making his then-highest ODI score of 129 from 77 balls against New Zealand. After playing in the first two Tests against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates during October, Buttler was dropped for the third Test, replaced as wicket-keeper by Jonny Bairstow, and was not selected for any of the Test matches during England's tour of South Africa, although he did play again in the one-day fixtures during the tour. In the fourth ODI against Pakistan in Dubai in November, he scored a 46-ball century, the fastest ODI hundred by an England player. Buttler again played for England in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 and was a regular fixture in the limited-overs squad throughout the year. He scored an unbeaten 90 runs against Pakistan as part of an England record score of 444/3, the fastest half-century by an Englishman. Both records have since been surpassed. Buttler captained the England side in the ODI series against Bangladesh in October 2016 after numerous players, including regular captain Eoin Morgan, declined to tour over raised security concerns following a terrorist attack in Dhaka in July. In the second ODI, there was some controversy as Buttler was involved in a heated exchange with numerous Bangladesh players following his dismissal to Taskin Ahmed. Buttler, aggravated by the opposition's excessive celebrations, turned to confront them, resulting in him being ushered away by the umpires. Following the incident, Buttler was reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and received one demerit point to his disciplinary record, while Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza and Sabbir Rahman were each fined 20% of their match fees and given a demerit point. Buttler was again reserve wicket-keeper for the Test series against Bangladesh. He returned to the England Test side for the third Test against India in November, playing in the final three Tests of the series. He continued as a regular in the limited-overs side throughout 2016 and 2017, playing again for England in the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, but was unable to break back into the Test side and was not selected for the 2017‚Äì18 Ashes series in Australia. He was named in the ICC World ODI XI in 2016. 2018‚Äìpresent: Return to Test cricket, World Cup and Ashes series In May 2018, Buttler was recalled into England's Test squad to play Pakistan at Lord's later that month. He had a successful return to Test cricket, scoring two half-centuries and scoring the most runs in the series; he also won the Man of the Match award at Headingley. In the subsequent ODI series against Australia in June 2018, he scored two half-centuries in the first four matches and then, in the fifth and final game of the series, he made 110 not out to take England to a historic series whitewash. In this match, no other English batsman made more than 20 and Buttler was afterwards described as \\"the best white-ball wicketkeeper batsman in the world\\". Buttler was named Man of the Match for his 110 not out, and also named Man of the Series for his impressive contributions with both bat and gloves. In the T20I match of Australia's tour, Buttler scored the fastest T20I half-century by an English cricketer, in 22 balls.Dobell, George.

He registered his maiden Test century in the third Test of India's tour of England in August 2018, with a score of 106. Buttler then retained his place in the Test and one-day squads, being selected to tour Sri Lanka in October and into the following year. In February 2019, during the fourth ODI of England's tour of the West Indies, Buttler scored a career-best 150 from 77 deliveries as England reached 418/6. During this innings, he hit 12 sixes, at the time the most by any English batsman in an ODI, and went from 51 to 100 in just 15 balls and from 100 to 150 in just 16 deliveries. This was part of an England world record for the most sixes in an ODI, with 24. Following the innings, West Indian batsman Chris Gayle praised Buttler, stating, \\"He is superb, one of the best strikers [of the ball] in world cricket today.... We can see he is a game-winner, a game-changer and every team needs a player like that to win games.\\", while England captain Eoin Morgan described him as \\"built like a champion racehorse\\". In the second ODI of the five-match series against Pakistan in May, Buttler scored an unbeaten 110 from 55 balls, his century coming in only 50 deliveries. This is the second fastest hundred by an English batsman in ODI cricket after his own record set against Pakistan in 2015. 2019 Cricket World Cup In April 2019, he was named as the vice-captain of the England squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. The ICC named Buttler as the key player of England's squad prior to the tournament. Buttler made a quiet start to the tournament, scoring only 18 runs in the opening match of the tournament against South Africa at The Oval, which ended in a comprehensive 104-run win for England. In the next match against Pakistan, he scored 103 from 76 balls (the then-fastest century by an English batsman in a World Cup) and shared a 130-run partnership with Joe Root for the fourth wicket, despite a shock 14-run defeat. He made 64 in the third match against Bangladesh as England posted 386/6, their highest ever World Cup score. However, he did not keep wicket during Bangladesh's innings after sustaining a minor hip injury while batting, making way for Jonny Bairstow to assume the role for the match, which England won by 106 runs. Buttler scored 59 runs in the final against New Zealand and contributed to a crucial 110-run partnership with Ben Stokes to help tie the match, with both teams making 241 from their respective innings. He was selected to bat in the ensuing Super Over along with Stokes, from which the pair scored 15 runs; Buttler scoring seven with a boundary from the final ball. He completed the run out of Martin Guptill on the last ball of New Zealand's over as he attempted a match-winning second run. This tied the Super Over and secured England's maiden World Cup title, winning by a superior boundary count. In July 2019, following England's World Cup success, the ECB named Buttler in the fourteen-man Test squad for the upcoming Ashes series. 2020 On 29 May 2020, Buttler was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 June 2020, Buttler was included in England's 30-man squad to start training behind closed doors for the Test series against the West Indies. On 4 July 2020, Buttler was named in England's thirteen-man squad for the first Test match of the series. He scored his second Test hundred, making 152 runs against Pakistan in the third Test.https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12123/12054391/jos-buttler-scores- hundred-for-england-after-overturning-dismissal-on-99.

He played in the first six games for Thunder before joining the England squad for the limited-over fixtures of England's tour of Australia. He scored 67 and 81 in separate games against Hobart Hurricanes, being named Player of the Match in the first fixture. 2018 Indian Premier League In January 2018, Buttler was bought by the Rajasthan Royals in the 2018 IPL auction for . Buttler had a difficult start for the Royals, making a high score of just 29 in his first seven innings. However, on being promoted to open the batting mid-tournament, his performances significantly improved. He subsequently became only the second batsman in IPL history to achieve five scores of fifty or more in consecutive matches. He made an unbeaten 95 from 60 balls against Chennai Super Kings, his highest score in the T20 format to date. 2018‚Äì19 Big Bash League Buttler again played for Sydney Thunder in the 2018‚Äì19 Big Bash League, this time alongside England teammate Joe Root. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) allowed Buttler and Root to play the first half of the season, despite a busy international schedule throughout 2019. Buttler made his highest BBL score of 89 from 54 deliveries against Hobart Hurricanes, despite a seven-wicket defeat, before making 55 in a thrilling one-run win over Perth Scorchers. Buttler departed as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 273 from seven innings, making three half-centuries at an average of 39.00. 2019 Indian Premier League Rajasthan Royals retained Buttler for the 2019 IPL season. In a match between Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab, Buttler was controversially run out on 69 by Indian bowler Ravichandran Ashwin via 'Mankading', an act that Ashwin was heavily criticised for. Former Australian bowler and Rajasthan mentor Shane Warne called the incident a \\"disgraceful and low act\\". This is the second instance in which Buttler has been dismissed in this fashion, the other occasion in an ODI match for England against Sri Lanka in 2014. In his next two matches for Rajasthan, he was dismissed for scores of just five and six but returned to form after hitting 59 from 43 balls in a fixture against Royal Challengers Bangalore. He also made a score of 89 from 43 deliveries against Mumbai Indians, hitting 28 runs off the 13th over. Personal life In October 2017, Buttler married Louise Webber. England teammates Steven Finn and Alex Hales acted as ushers for the wedding. Their daughter, Georgia Rose, was born in April 2019. Buttler was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to cricket. Playing style A tall and strongly-built cricketer, Buttler has an upright stance in the crease. During his maiden first-class century against Hampshire in 2010, he \\"hit the ball hard and straight\\", \\"moving his feet decisively, playing with his bat close to his body and selecting the right balls to attack\\". Buttler was praised for \\"remaining cool and composed at the crease\\" and for his \\"dogged determination and decent range of shots\\" during the innings. Somerset captain Marcus Trescothick suggested that Buttler could challenge teammate Craig Kieswetter's place in the England team. Buttler's temperament in the longer forms of the game has been questioned at times as his career has developed. In 2013, he was out for 94 runs for Somerset while attempting to reach his century by hitting a six and George Dobell, writing for ESPNcricinfo, questioned \\"his ability to defend and deny [bowlers]\\". Dobell praised the first half of Buttler's innings, which ensured a draw for Somerset, saying that \\"it showed a young man responding to his team's needs with a restrained, mature performance that exhibited a decent defence and an ability to leave and play straight\\" and that he had \\"produced some of those trademark straight drives and several powerful pulls\\" but felt that \\"it is the strokes he does not play that are as relevant as those he does\\".

Despite not always being his county's first-choice wicket- keeper and reservations about the quality of his work behind the stumps, Buttler has frequently been used in that role by the England team since the beginning of 2013, especially in one-day cricket. He was installed in the wicket-keeper role ahead of the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy after Craig Kieswetter faltered in terms of his batting ‚Äì Buttler's one-day batting, his potential and his ability to combine power with improvisation being seen as more important than any failings as a wicket-keeper ‚Äì despite, by his own admission, his \\"keeping [being] a work in progress\\". His wicket-keeping was \\"seen by some as having more potential\\" than his main rival for the job Jonny Bairstow and England wicket-keeper coach Bruce French spoke of his \\"natural hands\\" behind the stumps. Following Kieswetter's and Matt Prior's international retirements in 2015, Buttler became England's first-choice wicket-keeper in all formats. Whether he should play as a wicket-keeper or specialist batsman was questioned in middle of the 2015 season and Bairstow replaced him for the third ODI during Australia's 2015 tour due to Buttler's poor form with the bat throughout the Australian series. Bairstow eventually became the outright wicket-keeper for Tests in December 2015 for the series against South Africa, and Buttler was dropped from the Test side during 2016, whilst continuing to be the first-choice ODI and T20 wicket-keeper. Career best performances , Buttler has scored five first-class and 11 List A centuries, nine of which have been scored for England in One Day International matches.

The faculty is located on the northwestern corner of College Street and University Avenue, placing it across from the Ontario Legislative Building and at the entrance to Queen's Park station. It is also situated 1-2 blocks away from four internationally renowned hospitals ‚Äî The Hospital for Sick Children, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto General Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital. It is part of Toronto's Discovery District. The Faculty of Pharmacy Building is particularly notable for its two orb-shaped classrooms, referred to as the \\"pods\\", which are suspended lecture halls. The pods are lit at night with coloured stage lights visible from afar, giving the building a \\"Star Trek feel\\". Likened to giant glowing pills, the pods are reason #113 to love Toronto, and have been deemed \\"something of a local landmark.\\" The Pharmacy Building has received international coverage and awards, in part because of its design team, including world-famous Sir Norman Foster and Claude Engle, as well as its high-profile sponsor Leslie Dan. It was also featured on the cover of, as well as profiled in, the book Detail In Process. History The Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto began in 1853, when the Ontario College of Pharmacy (now Pharmacists) who first operated at the school had merged into the school curriculum.\\"Our History.\\" pharmacy.utoronto.ca. Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, n.d. Web.n.d. < > By 1868, the pharmacy program consisted of only a few evenings of voluntary classes, with no practically prerequisite classes. However, the long, tradition apprenticeship of this professional field had pressed a strong emphasis onto the students. Today, the program has evolved into \\"a compulsory, four-year second-entry scientific and professional university course with a supervised period of professional practice.\\" The organization of this program has become significantly more structured. This change in focus strayed away from the predominant emphasis of the practice of training through an apprenticeship to today's emphasis of a theoretical study and application of those skills in real-life situations. Students are better equipped with the skills which are required to meet the present needs of the profession. The University of Toronto was the only school in Ontario to offer a pharmacy education until the opening of the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in 2008. In 1877, the Faculty moved into the University of Toronto campus, and new levels of pharmaceutical education was offered as a PhD degree at the University of Toronto was being arranged. As the demands for more pharmacists increased, the demands of professional education in this particular field increased as well. As a result, in 1992, the faculty introduced the PharmD- Doctor of Pharmacy- in hopes to accommodate for the growing need for graduates in the field. Within the past decade, enrolment in the undergraduate and graduate programs and doubled and tripled in size respectively. The Faculty had no choice but to expand their facilities, thus moving to their current location at 144 College Street in 2006. The Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Toronto's Arms and Badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 17 May 2001.Arms and Badge The Latin motto is \\"Trutina Penso Doctrinae\\" which means \\"I weigh by the balance of learning.\\" As the only faculty of pharmacy in Ontario until 2007, the Faculty needed to expand beyond 120 students per year, but could not do so in its limited space. The largest room in the former Pharmacy Building (the Norman F. Hughes building, now the Anthropology Building, located at Huron St. and Russell St.) held only 30 students, and each year (at the time of the proposal) had 120 students. Thus, none of the pharmacy classes could be held within its own building, a serious problem for any professional faculty. As well, the various pharmacy research labs were interspersed throughout the campus. Construction of a new building enabled the pharmacy programme to gradually increase its student intake to 240 new students per year in September 2006, doubling its previous capacity; between 2000 and 2008, the total enrolment in the pharmacy program (all 4 years) increased from 499 to 1,011 students. Other programs administrated by the Faculty, including the graduate-level advanced Pharm.D. program (not to be confused with an entry-level Pharm.D.), the Bachelor of Science specialisation in pharmaceutical chemistry, the M.Sc. and Ph.D. programmes in pharmaceutical sciences and the International Pharmacy Graduates bridging programme also experienced significant growth. On 19 April 2011, the Faculty announced a $1 million donation from Walmart Canada to create the Walmart Canada International Pharmacy Education Centre. This Centre will feature enhanced facilities including a one hundred seat classroom, and will allow increased enrollment into the programme. The $75-million (CAD) building was funded by numerous alumni and organisations, along with the Government of Ontario's SuperBuild fund. The building was named the Leslie L. Dan Faculty of Pharmacy Building in 2001 in honour of the generous donation made by Leslie Dan, an alumnus of the school and a noted pharmacist, philanthropist, entrepreneur and Member of the Order of Canada, as well as founder of the generic drug manufacturer Novopharm and the Canadian Medical Aid Programme. Dan donated $8 million earmarked specifically for the building in 2000, at which point the building was named for him; this was followed up with a $7 million donation to his alma mater in 2002, resulting in the Faculty of Pharmacy being renamed to the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy. Academics and curricula The Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy offers several degrees: * Master of Science in Pharmacy (MScPhm) *Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) *Doctor of Philosophy in Pharmaceutical Sciences (PhD) * Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences (MSc) * Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences (BSc) The current entry-to-practice PharmD program graduated its first class in 2015, coinciding with the graduation of the last class of traditional post-graduate PharmD students. This change mirrors that of the pharmacy curriculum in the United States of America: introducing advanced pharmacy practice experiences, increasing program admission requirements, thereby reducing and streamlining the didactic portions of the curriculum. This new entry-to-practice PharmD program replaces the previous entry-to-practice Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (BScPhm) program. Practicing pharmacists holding BScPhm may choose to elect to bridge to the current PharmD degree via the PharmD for Pharmacists program. Graduates from this program will hold both the traditional BScPhm and current PharmD degrees. Since the traditional post-graduate PharmD program is also no longer available, a new post-graduate degree in the form of MScPhm has been established to further the clinical and research skills of practicing pharmacists. At the University of Toronto, pharmacy students are already being trained for physical assessments and prescribing rights through problem-based, experiential and student-directed approaches to common ailments, case-based and critical reasoning skills and other coursework in pathophysiology, clinical biochemistry and pharmaceutical care. These represent important advances in pharmacy education and the pharmacists' new critical role in Canada's health care system, and the use of the new building for Pharmacy is a symbol of the University of Toronto's dedication to health care and pharmaceutical research. In addition, the Faculty offers a non-professional undergraduate Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Science program along with graduate research programs that lead to Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy (MSc and PhD) degrees in pharmaceutical science.

It is characterised by having many narrow fire-tubes, running horizontally. Boilers like this have been widely used on ships as either auxiliary or donkey boilers. Smaller examples, particularly the Robertson type have been used for steam wagons.  Parallel tube boilers  Cochran boiler Parallel tube boilers place all of their fire-tubes in a single parallel group, running from side to side of the boiler shell. The best known of these is the Cochran design.  Cochran boiler  The Cochran boiler was produced by Cochran & Co. of Annan, Scotland.Cochran It is widely used in marine practice, either fired directly by coal or oil fuels, or else used for heat recovery from the exhaust of large diesel engines. Where such a boiler may be heated either by the exhaust gases of the main propulsion plant, or else separately fired when in port (usually by oil rather than coal) it is referred to as a composite boiler. The boiler is a cylindrical vertical water drum with a hemispherical domed top. This domed shape is strong enough not to require staying. The firebox is another hemispherical dome, riveted to the base foundation ring to give a narrow waterspace. The fire-tubes are arranged in a single horizontal group above this, mounted between two flat vertical plates that are inset into the boiler barrel. The first of these plates forms a shallow combustion chamber and is connected to the firebox by a short diagonal neck. The combustion chamber is of the \\"dry back\\" form and is closed by a steel and firebrick plate, rather than a water jacket. The exhaust from the fire-tubes is into an external smokebox and a vertical flue. For maintenance access to the tubes, a manhole is provided in the hemispherical dome. A typical Cochran boiler, as illustrated, might be high and in diameter, giving a heating surface of , and a grate area of . Working pressure is between . Where composite firing is used, there are several possible arrangements for the heating gases. Most use a double-pass tube arrangement where another dry back combustion chamber routes the gases from one tube bank to return through the other. Some arrangements use a separate tube bank for the heat recovery exhaust gases or the direct firing gases, others pass the exhaust gases into the top of the (unlit) firebox. A pure heat-recovery boiler may have no firebox at all, other than a shallow domed plate for strength. GNSR railmotor Cochran also offer a modified \\"Sinuflo\\" fire-tube, which is claimed to offer better heat transfer from the gases. This is bent into a number of horizontal sinusoidal waves, rather than being straight. The Cochran boiler was not applied to locomotives, but was used for a pair of experimental steam railmotors built for the GNSR by Andrew Barclay in 1905. These were not successful and were scrapped after a few years, although one coach body survives in a poor state.  Clarke Chapman boiler  Clarke Chapman 'wet back' \\"Victoria\\" boiler The Clarke Chapman boiler is similar to the Cochran type, with the difference that the top of the boiler shell is a shallow dome rather than a hemisphere. This dome shape is still sufficiently strong to withstand the pressure, but there is now a sharp corner between the shell and the top plate. This corner requires the support of gusset stays. Clarke Chapman boilers are made in both 'dry back' (as for the Cochran) and 'wet back' forms.Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol III The wet back or \\"Victoria\\" (illustrated) has the combustion chamber entirely surrounded by water. This increases the heating surface and reduces lost heat, but it also makes the boiler more complex to manufacture and makes tube cleaning more difficult.  Radial horizontal tube boilers  Robertson \\"autocar\\" boiler Radial horizontal tube boilers avoid the flat tubeplate of the Cochran boiler in favour of a circular firebox, a shape that better resists pressure. They thus have their tubes arranged radially, so as to seat more easily by entering the firebox perpendicular to the plate.  Robertson boiler  The design by Robertson of Fleetwood, Lancashire, was originally used in steam wagons. It was often used in similar situations to the Sentinel boiler, but has fire-tubes rather than watertubes. It is best known from its popularity in model engineering, as a multi-tube boiler that's relatively easy to construct. The boiler consists of two concentric drums with a waterspace between them. Fire-tubes pass through this drum, arranged symmetrically around the diameter. The entire boiler is wrapped in a cylindrical smokebox. The top of the inner drum is not water-jacketed and is only closed by a steel plate. The outer drum is a parallel cylinder but the inner drum is usually stepped in three diameters: wide around the fire grate to provide the most grate area and to promote rapid boiling in its waterjacket, the central section carries the inner ends of the fire-tubes, and the upper section is narrowed to reduce the unjacketed surface area and to provide an open steam space above the waterline. This upper space is deliberately oversized so that when fitted to a road vehicle, any tilting during hill climbing will still leave an adequate depth of water cover above the tubes. The top plate is unjacketed so that it may contain a hatch and a firing chute. Where the boiler is used for steam wagons it is often coke-fired with a deep firebed, and coke is merely poured down this chute rather than carefully distributed. This means of firing is acceptable with coke, but with coal would lead to a thick, dull fire that blocked with clinker. It is also less distracting when trying to drive a steam vehicle. Avoiding coal also reduces the risk of volatile gases flaring out of the firing chute when it is opened. The boiler is sometimes superheated by a semi-radiant element arranged as a coil inside the upper part of the central drum.  Other designs  Blake boiler  Blake boiler  The Blake boiler has features of both the Clarke Chapman and the Robertson designs. The combustion chamber is set entirely within the water space so that all of it can provide heating surface, and it is made cylindrical for strength. The tubes are arranged radially rather than in a parallel group, so as to enter the combustion chamber perpendicularly. This makes expanding their ends a simpler operation and gives better sealing. The smokebox is larger and partially wraps around the outside of the boiler drum.  Harris \\"Economic\\" boiler  The Harris \\"Economic\\" boilerHarris, Model Boilers, pp. 158-159 is a design for a model engineering-sized boiler. Similar to the Blake, but symmetrical with a centrally placed combustion chamber and fire-tubes around the entire circumference.  Riley Brothers  Similar boilers, both fire- tube to 'Meredith's Patent' and water-tube boilers of their own design, were also produced by Riley Brothers of Stockton-on-Tees from around 1890 to WWI.

Background During \\"the Deluge\\", when the Swedish armies invaded Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, which was already struggling with Muscovy, the Voivode of Pozna≈Ñ, Krzysztof Opali≈Ñski, surrendered Greater Poland to Swedish king Charles Gustav. Other areas also surrendered in rapid succession. Almost the whole country followed suit, with the Swedes entering Warsaw unopposed in August 1655 and John Casimir fleeing to Silesia, where he took refuge in the town of Oberglogau () staying there in a local castle from October 17, 1655 until December 18 of the same year. However several places still resisted, most remarkably (and symbolically) the monastery at Jasna G√≥ra (November 1655 to January 1656). The defense of Jasna G√≥ra galvanized Polish resistance against the Swedes, as aggression on that place, perceived by Catholic Poles as the most holy sanctuary, rose massive anti-Swedish sentiments. In December 1655 the Tyszowce Confederation formed in support of the exiled John Casimir. Spontaneous uprisings started all over the country, attacking the dispersed occupation forces ‚Äî who, in their turn, retaliated. The uprisings soon merged under the leadership of Polish military leaders Stefan Czarniecki and Grand Hetman of Lithuania Pawe≈Ç Jan Sapieha, who started organized counterattacks in order to eliminate those loyal to Charles Gustav. Considering these facts, John II Casimir decided to return. Trying to pass Swedish troops unexposed, he rode with only small host, from Silesia through Carpathian Mountains, finally reaching Lw√≥w in March 1656. The Lw√≥w Oath \\"Lw√≥w Oath\\" by Jan Matejko As almost the whole country was occupied by the Swedish or Russian armies, the reason behind the vow was to incite the whole nation, including peasantry in the first place, to rise up against the invaders. Thus two main issues raised by the king in the vows were primarily - a necessity to protect the Catholic faith, seen as endangered by the Lutheran (and to some point Orthodox) aggressors, secondly - to manifest the will to improve the peasantry's condition. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lw√≥w's Cathedral, conducted by the papal legate Pietro Vidoni, John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries. He also swore to protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage. Today, the Blessed Virgin Mary is known as the Queen of Poland. After the King, similar vow was taken by the Deputy Chancellor of the Crown and the bishop of Krak√≥w Andrzej Trzebicki in the name of the szlachta noblemen of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth forces finally drove back the Swedes in 1657 and the Russians in 1661. After the war, promises made by John Casimir in Lw√≥w, especially those considering peasants' lot, were not fulfilled, mostly because of Sejm's objection, which represented the szlachta nobility, not attracted to the idea of reducing serfdom, which would negatively affect their economical interests.

There is archaeological evidence of a Saxon mill on the site and records in the Domesday book of later mills; the present redbrick structure dates to the late 18th century, with alterations from the 19th Century. The ford from which the mill takes its name is where the Roman road now called Mareham Lane crossed the Slea. The original crossing, no longer extant, is a few hundred yards downstream of the mill, close to the current footbridge. There were many other mills along the river at various times. During the construction of the Sleaford Navigation, in the 1790s, locks were provided at each of the mills to maintain the necessary head. After the navigation closed and as the locks fell into repair they were replaced by weirs, and the weir at Cogglesford is particularly elaborate, having to maintain the head of this still working mill. Cogglesford mill (including the mill race and bridge) was assigned a listed status on 20 July 1973. The mill is open to the public 7 days a week during the summer and Organic stoneground flour is milled there and sold in shop. Gallery References Further reading * N. Pevsner, J. Harris, N.

Lunate cells of Nepenthes khasiana visualized by Scanning White Light Interferometry (SWLI). A white light scanner (WLS) is a device for performing surface height measurements of an object using coherence scanning interferometry (CSI) with spectrally-broadband, \\"white light\\" illumination. Different configurations of scanning interferometer may be used to measure macroscopic objects with surface profiles measuring in the centimeter range, to microscopic objects with surface profiles measuring in the micrometer range. For large-scale non-interferometric measurement systems, see structured-light 3D scanner. Description Figure 2\\\\. File:Twyman-Green interferometer set up as a white light scanner Vertical scanning interferometry is an example of low-coherence interferometry, which exploits the low coherence of white light. Interference will only be achieved when the path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence time of the light source. VSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the shape of the fringes. Fig. 2 illustrates a Twyman‚ÄìGreen interferometer set up for white light scanning of a macroscopic object. Light from the test specimen is mixed with light reflected from the reference mirror to form an interference pattern. Fringes appear in the CCD image only where the optical path lengths differ by less than half the coherence length of the light source, which is generally on the order of micrometers. The interference signal (correlogram) is recorded and analyzed as either the specimen or reference mirror is scanned. The focus position of any particular point on the surface of the specimen corresponds to the point of maximum fringe contrast (i.e. where the modulation of the correlogram is greatest). Fig. 3 illustrates a white light interferometric microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective. Other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt too much of the aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The objective (or alternatively, the sample) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of low-coherence interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2 pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig. 1, which scans a 180 Œºm √ó 140 Œºm √ó 10 Œºm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined by the coherence length of the light source and is typically in the micrometer range.Wojtek J.

Technical Figure 3\\\\. White light interferometric microscope White-light interferometry scanning (WLS) systems capture intensity data at a series of positions along the vertical axis, determining where the surface is located by using the shape of the white-light interferogram, the localized phase of the interferogram, or a combination of both shape and phase. The white light interferogram actually consists of the superposition of fringes generated by multiple wavelengths, obtaining peak fringe contrast as a function of scan position, that is, the red portion of the object beam interferes with the red portion of the reference beam, the blue interferes with the blue, and so forth. In a WLS system, an imaging interferometer is vertically scanned to vary the optical path difference. During this process, a series of interference patterns are formed at each pixel in the instrument field of view. This results in an interference function, with interference varying as a function of optical path difference. The data are stored digitally and processed in a variety of ways depending on the system manufacturer, including being Fourier-transformed into frequency space, subject to cross-correlation methods, or analysis in the spatial domain. If a Fourier transform is used, the original intensity data are expressed in terms of interference phase as a function of wavenumber. Wavenumber k is a representation of wavelength in the spatial frequency domain, defined by k = 2œÄ/Œª. If phase is plotted versus wavenumber, the slope of the function corresponds to the relative change in group-velocity optical path difference DG by Dh = DG/2nG where nG is group-velocity index of refraction. If this calculation is performed for each pixel, a three- dimensional surface height map emerges from the data. In the actual measuring process, the optical path difference is steadily increased by scanning the objective vertically using a precision mechanical stage or piezoelectric positioner. Interference data are captured at each step in the scan. In effect, an interferogram is captured as a function of vertical position for each pixel in the detector array. To sift through the large amount of data acquired over long scans, many different techniques can be employed.

The last known case of variola minor was in Somalia in 1977. Smallpox was formally declared eradicated on May 8, 1980. Variola minor is of the genus Orthopoxvirus, which are DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of the affected cell, rather than in its nucleus. Like variola major, alastrim was spread through inhalation of the virus in the air, which could occur through face-to-face contact or through fomites. Infection with variola minor conferred immunity against the more dangerous variola major. Variola minor was a less common form of the virus, and much less deadly. Although alastrim had the same incubation period and pathogenetic stages as smallpox, alastrim is believed to have had a mortality rate of less than 1%, as compared to smallpox's 30%. Because alastrim was a less debilitating disease than smallpox, patients were more frequently ambulant and thus able to infect others more rapidly. As such, variola minor swept through the United States, Great Britain, and South Africa in the early 20th century, becoming the dominant form of the disease in those areas and thus rapidly decreasing mortality rates. Alastrim was also called white pox, kaffir pox, Cuban itch, West Indian pox, milk pox, and pseudovariola. Like smallpox, alastrim has now been totally eradicated from the globe thanks to the 1960s Global Smallpox Eradication campaign. The last case of indigenous variola minor was reported in a Somali cook, Ali Maow Maalin, in October 1977, and smallpox was officially declared eradicated worldwide in May 1980.

He was born around 1630 and he inherited his title on his father's death in 1636. He married Lady Frances Seymour, but they had no children. On 20 June 1642 Molyneux attended the commission of array on Preston Moor, and assisted at the seizure of the magazine at Preston. On the outbreak of the Civil War he raised two regiments, one of horse and the other of foot, composed chiefly of Roman Catholics, for the service of the king, forming part of the Lancashire forces under the command of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby. Molyneux was present at the siege of Manchester in September 1642, and on 20 April 1643 was defeated by Captain Ashton at Whalley. After the surprise capture of Wakefield on 21 May 1643, the Earl of Derby being then with Queen Henrietta Maria at York, Molyneux was ordered to conduct the Lancashire forces thither. He was defeated on 20 August 1644 by Major-general Sir John Meldrum at the battle of Ormskirk, and narrowly escaped capture by hiding in a field of corn. He was at Oxford on 24 June 1646, when the city surrendered to the Parliament. On 30 June 1648 a warrant was signed by the Derby House Committee for his arrest, as having, contrary to an ordinance of Parliament, approached within twenty miles of London. He was suspected of being concerned in the rising of the royalist gentry at Kingston on 5 July, but four days later an order was issued for his discharge. Molyneux joined Charles II on his march to Worcester, and escaped after the battle on 3 September 1651, but died shortly afterwards, probably in 1654. He was succeeded by his brother, Caryll Molyneux, 3rd Viscount Molyneux (1621-1699), who played an active part during the Civil War on the Royalist side.

Syndicalism Rossi began his political career on the left with the Italian Socialist Party and as a writer for various syndicalist journals.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 330 However he left the Socialists in 1907 to serve in the Italian Army and did not rejoin following his demobilisation. Instead he embraced syndicalism fully by becoming a leading member of the Unione Sindacale Italiana. He joined the Fasci di Azione Rivoluzionaria in 1914 and by 1919 this had led to him joining the Fasci italiani di combattimento. Fascism A leading writer for Il Popolo d'Italia, Rossi was recognised as one of Benito Mussolini's closest advisers in the early days of the fascist movement. Rossi soon gained a reputation for his moderation and was instrumental in the Pact of Pacification, a 1921 agreement that temporarily slowed down the violence of the Blackshirts.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 331 Working with Mussolini he also developed a strategy of trying to win over the left into a cross-class alliance.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-1945, 2001, p. 93 He attained the rank of assistant secretary of the movement in 1921 and was effective leader in Tuscany whilst he went on to sit on the National Fascist Party national council and the Grand Council of Fascism. He was the leader of a fasci and an important figure in the March on Rome. Following this seizure of power Rossi was appointed director of Mussolini's Press and Propaganda Office. He was also central in organising not only the 1924 election but also the reprisals against the areas that had rejected fascism which followed. A potential conflict of interest had arisen in February 1923 when Mussolini banned Fascist Party members from involvement in Freemasonry but ultimately the ban was not enforced as Rossi was just one of a number of Freemasons prominent within the party.Nicholas Farrell, Mussolini: A New Life, Phoenix, 2004, p. 134 Allegations of murder Rossi's rise through the ranks of the fascist state came to an abrupt end in 1924 with the murder of Giacomo Matteotti after he was accused of being responsible. It was argued that Rossi, who had flown into a rage after one of the two speeches that sealed Matteotti's fate, had ordered his deputy Amerigo Dumini to kill the Socialist deputy for his anti-fascism. The incident, which angered even some fascists, led to a split between Rossi and Mussolini. Rossi fled to France and then Switzerland to escape prosecution and became a critic of fascism in his exile. He was tricked into returning to Italy in 1928 and was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for his part in the murder. He was released after the fall of fascism and, following some investigations into his own past that acquitted him of involvement in the excesses of fascism, he returned to journalism and left politics behind. In the Florestano Vancini's film The Assassination of Matteotti (1973), Rossi is played by Cesare Barbetti.

However, Channel Four were unsure about the project, and only agreed to fund a short animated sequence as a pilot - which is all that was ultimately made.http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/720892/index.html Plot In the film, Gilgamesh is a grotesque, Picasso-esque being who moves by tricycle and patrols his box-shaped kingdom that hovers above a dark abyss. The yellow walls are inscribed with calligraphic text and its seemingly vast expanse is randomly broken up by square holes from which medical hooks occasionally project. A table ‚Äì a mechanism and a trap ‚Äì concealing a pulsating vagina within one of its drawers, stands at the centre of Gilgamesh‚Äôs domain. High above this space are strung high-tension wires, vibrating in the wind, one caught with a broken tennis racquet. First, Gilgamesh is seen setting up a bizarre trap to lure and catch the wild man Enkidu (who is depicted as a bird- like creature, partially made of genuine animal skeletons). Enkidu appears to live in a distant forest world visible through a hatch in the side of one of the walls of the floating kingdom. Gilgamesh is seen eating dandelion fluff during the opening credits before he finishes readying the trap. Once finished, Gilgamesh retreats to a room beneath the floor of the floating kingdom, awaiting Enkidu's arrival. Sometime later, Enkidu enters and becomes intrigued by a table with an anatomical, H.R. Giger/da Vinci-esque image of a woman's muscles (symbolizing the character Shamhat). The mechanism activates allowing Enkidu to look inside the image revealing a swaying piece of meat on a hook within the woman's body. A drawer on the table opens, revealing the pulsating vagina. Ecstatic, Enkidu begins to mount the table, which sets off Gilgamesh's trap, flinging him onto the high-tension wires. An excited Gilgamesh resurfaces, retrieving the ensnared Enkidu by means of a giant gold cloth. Gilgamesh binds his captive with twine, beats him with a spiked club, and brushes his wings before cutting them off with scissors. Gilgamesh cuts the twine binding Enkidu and as the gold cloth falls to the ground the viewer is given a shot of Enkidu‚Äôs forest. The same fluff that Gilgamesh was eating earlier litters the forest floor and the viewer is allowed to observe an insect husk rapidly decay. In the end, Gilgamesh is seen riding frenzied circles around Enkidu, who is now trapped beneath the table-mechanism on which the trap was set.http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/720892/index.html Themes As a symbolic representation, Gilgamesh‚Äôs world is one of evil and deceit, simultaneously laced with psychosexual tension and personal resonance for the Quays. The medical hooks, rusting scissors, and razor sharp high- tension wires all imply a castration theme, accentuated not just by the sadistic mechanical trap that Gilgamesh sets but also by the sequence in which he places two eggs on a slicing wicket, positioning them where his own testicles should be. Such brutal and sexually violent imagery would reoccur in the brothers‚Äô other films, most notably in Street of Crocodiles, where organic materials are organized into representations of male genitals then pierced with tailor's pins.http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2004/great- directors/quay_brothers/#6 Differences between the First Tablet of The Epic of Gilgamesh and the film In the epic poem Gilgamesh is King of Uruk and oppresses his citizens. In the Quays‚Äô adaption he is lord over an isolated kingdom where he is the sole denizen. In the Epic Enkidu is a Wildman created by the gods to distract Gilgamesh from his questionable activities. Enkidu is spotted uprooting traps, ruining a trapper's trade. Enkidu is then seduced by Shamhat, a temple prostitute, the first step in civilizing him. The Brothers version shows Enkidu first being seduced by Shamhat, leading him into a trap that Gilgamesh has set for him.The Epic of Gilgamesh, Translated by Maureen Gallery Kovacs, Electronic Edition by Wolf Carnahan, I998, Ancient Texts.org Influence The film had many inspirations besides the Gilgamesh legend. The violence that pervades the film is a tribute to Austrian writer Konrad Bayer, the physical design of Gilgamesh was based on artwork by Heinrich Anton M√ºller, one of a trio of artists that the Quays originally intended to dedicate their film to. 'Hunar Louse' is a satirical representation of Lunar House in London, the headquarters of the UK Border Agency, which called the Quays' visa status into question at the time they were making the film. Though this was distressing at the time, the experience helped create the paranoid atmosphere that saturates the film.This Unnameable Little Broom (1985), British Film Institute's Screen Online websiteThe Epic of Gilgamesh - The Quay Brothers , Zeitgeist Films website References Category:British animated short films Category:British films Category:1985 films Category:Films based on poems Category:Films directed by the Brothers Quay Category:Stop-motion animated short films Category:Works based on the Epic of Gilgamesh ","title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh, or This Unnameable Little Broom"},{"id":"24379606","text":"Linzhou (), formerly Lin County or Linxian (()), is a county-level city in Anyang, Henan, China.

It is a tall brick building constructed in 1925 in the Classical Revival architectural style. Its construction was partially financed by local employers General Electric and the American Locomotive Company, which needed space for new workers to live and wanted an architecturally distinctive building comparable with large city hotels of the era. Today, it is one of the main buildings of Schenectady County Community College. Building Elston Hall is located at the northeast corner of the college property, right at the corner of State (NY 5) and Washington streets. Only the two acres (8,000 m¬≤) on which the building sits is included in the listing. To the south Washington feeds into Interstate 890; the Schenectady Armory, also listed on the National Register, is located almost across Washington. Directly across from the building, on the east side of Washington, is a garden with a fountain. On the north Washington is part of the Stockade Historic District, the oldest section of Schenectady. One block to the west, State crosses the Mohawk River via the Western Gateway Bridge to Scotia. Exterior The building itself is six stories high, faced in limestone-trimmed brick over a reinforced concrete frame. It is H-shaped, with the north wing shorter than the south due to an extension of the main dining room, topped by a gabled roof with wooden eaves shingled in slate. Some other wings have been built on to the structure since the college began using it. They are too modern to be considered contributing to its historic character. Six Corinthian columns support the main entrance portico. Its entablature, with the words \\"SCHENECTADY COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE\\" on it in metal lettering, is topped by a dentilled cornice and flat roof with balustrade. Each pillar of the balustrade continues a column below and is topped with a decorative carved urn. The basement level is marked by a stone watercourse. The first floor is fenestrated with alternating rectangular and Palladian windows, and has a belt course of alternating brick and stone dividing it and the second story. White rosettes are between them and their lintels are of white stone with a keystone motif. Some windows are further embellished with swag-decorated friezes. The front doors are surmounted by broken-arch pediments with carved acorns set in blind arches. Decoration is more limited on the upper stories, with each window having just a simple stone sill and lintel. Another belt course like the lower one sets off the top story. The sixth floor's three central windows are each topped with a blind lunette and have iron balconies. The central five bays of the main block are further set off by rusticated stone quoins at the corner and five brick pilasters supporting a pediment and balustrade on the roofline. On the wings, there are similar touches. The south side's main entrance is a domed portico with classical detail, matched on the north wing by Ionic columns supporting a flat, dentilled entablature. The belt courses and fenestration are similar to those on the main block. The central window of the fifth (top) story on each wing is marked by a blind carved lunette and balcony, with a blind oculus in the gable. On the inner walls, the central of the three bays has a small circular or square window, alternating by story. A two-story kitchen wing projects from the north. Its windows have been bricked in but have similar decorative patterns (arches and rectangles) to the rest of the building. Two more modern wings, neither contributing, extend from it as well, as does as a large wing from the south of similar materials to the main block. Three emergency exit towers on the corners of the building likewise do not contribute as modern additions. Interior The first floor retains much of its original finishing. The lobby is in a Georgian mode, with pillars, pilasters and paneling. Its flooring is terrazzo with a genuine marble as a wall base. Another keystoned, lunetted door leads to the Lobby Lounge. Other designs from the exterior, such as the broken-arched niches with acorns, are also repeated inside. The Lobby Lounge itself, now known as the Mohawk Room, is a room with a semicircular wall. Five sets of double doors overlook the garden and river beyond. Its fireplaces and lunettes on the interior doors are original. The fanlights on the exterior doors are also original but they have been covered with shells on the inside to conceal indirect interior lighting. Just off the Lobby Lounge, the Reception Room now serves as the college president's office. It has most of its original finishes and has not been altered. The former Dining Room and Assembly Room were combined to make a single Ballroom, and are still together today although they can be divided with a partition. Its original western wall has mostly been removed. What was originally a small private dining room between the Lobby Lounge and Dining Room has now become part of a hallway connecting the building and its western annex. It is lit by the only remaining original chandelier in the hotel building. The upper stories have been gutted to serve college purposes. Nothing of their original layout or finish is left. Aesthetics H.L. Stevens & Co., the hotel's designers, specialized in small (less than 500 rooms) hotels and apartment houses in a neo-Georgian or Colonial Revival style in either a rectangular or H-shape, seen by the city's Chamber of Commerce as a refreshing change from the small, squarish hotels the city had previously possessed. Their buildings, primarily in the Northeast, are in many cases still extant and show similarities to the Van Curler. Most similar to the Van Curler is the Burritt Hotel in New Britain, Connecticut, also listed on the Register. It is also of brick, has nearly identical limestone decoration and is also H-shaped. The Colonial Hotel in Gardner, Massachusetts, also has a similar design except for the projecting wings and the Federal style decoration at the top. To facilitate it use as a center for local functions, it was designed so that the ballrooms could be entered without having to cross the lobby, seen as the space for commercial travelers. The Georgian Revival style was used for other buildings in the city at the same period, most notably City Hall in 1933. History In the 35 years leading up to the hotel's 1925 construction, Schenectady's population quintupled, making it the fastest-growing city in New York. It became ten times as wealthy. Both of these developments were a result of the city becoming the headquarters of General Electric (GE) and the American Locomotive Company (ALCO). The two corporations contributed $300,000 of the hotel's $700,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) construction cost. The local Chamber of Commerce and a thousand citizens filled in the rest. It was named after Arendt van Curler, the Dutch explorer who first saw the site of Schenectady in 1661. Ultimately it would cost $1.1 million ($ in contemporary dollars) The Stevens firm was chosen for the design, due to its successful similar contemporary buildings. A branch of the Mohawk River, the Binne Kill was filled in, streets were widened, a sea wall was built along the Mohawk to the Rotterdam line, and streets were widened. The hotel was publicly owned, so some smaller nearby hotels were torn down to eliminate competition. The building became a focus of civic pride, hosting many major events even as the city declined due to suburbanization, GE began moving work elsewhere and ALCO went into decline along with its industry. In addition to the many local functions it hosted, it became a popular lunch spot for workers at the nearby GE plant. Among its many notable guests over the years were then-governor Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor, John Philip Sousa, Clement Attlee and Robert F. Kennedy. In 1954 the additions were built to accommodate the increasing demands of business travelers. Every one of the new rooms had air conditioning and a private bath. These rooms rented well, but increasingly guests preferred them to the old section of the hotel, with an overall negative effect on the hotel's occupancy rate. It declared bankruptcy in 1968. Schenectady County bought the building at the ensuing public auction for $710,000 ($ in contemporary dollars), and converted it for its current use by the college. The college's board of trustees renamed it after Charles Elston, the longtime chairman of the county's Board of Representatives.

Biography Vrtanes Papazian was born in the city of Van, Ottoman Empire, in 1866. His father, archimandrite Mesrop Papazyan, was a well-known religious and public figure, pedagogue, writer, theater expert, and playwright. At the age of four he moved with his parents to Agulis where he received his primary education. He continued his study at the Aramian School in Tavriz and Gevorgian Theological Seminary in Etchmiadzin. Later he studied at the Geneva University, the faculty of literature and social sciences. Hard conditions made him start working at the age of 15 and wander from city to city, country to country. He worked as a laborer, photographer and telegrapher. For a long period he was teaching at schools in several cities (Van, Karin, Tbilisi, Tehran, Shoushi, Bucharest etc.). He worked as the editor of newspapers Free Armenia, Struggle of the Armenian revolutionist labourer association (Tbilisi), of the weekly Path (Tehran) and of the weekly Karabakh (Shoushi). He cooperated with a number of Armenian, Russian and European press organs. The events of the 1915 genocide did not pass by his family. His brother, Nerses Papazyan (archimandrite Mashtots), abbot of Armenian Church in the northern American cities of Ustr and Boston, was arrested on 24 April 1915 in Constantinople and killed by the Turkish executioners. Literary works Grave of Vrtanes Papazian, Pantheon cemetery in Yerevan The literary legacy of Vrtanes Papazian is regarded as the twin of his life ‚Äì a valiant fighting of pen against national and social oppression, struggle for national survival and bright future. Looking into historical and current standards of various nations the writer referred to the Armenian life and culture in the light of those standards assessing national realities upon a wide range of criteria. His prolific literary creation is an outcome of a wide sphere of mental activity ‚Äì prose, dramaturgy, poetry, literary criticism, history of literature, producer work, music, pedagogy, linguistics, translation, logics, psychology etc. Early writings of Papazian are about the life of Western Armenians. During the 1890s these stories appeared in the press. Later they were published in two books: Scenes from the Life of Turkish Armenians (1889) and Stories from the Life of Turkish Armenians (1904). Speaking about the horrors by Turks and Kurds, he did not ignore the national oppressors showing that their conduct was equally horrible. Papazian condemned servility and fawn, setting forward tragic scenes from Western Armenian struggle against the organizers of genocide and creating characters of valiant individuals (‚ÄúKheran‚Äù, ‚ÄúLightning‚Äù, ‚ÄúLight Pleasures‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Dying are Greeting You‚Äù). He holds a relentless debate against any vicious opinion. The novel Emma strongly criticizes some national parties as being separated from the nation. While based in European countries far from the homeland these parties proclaim themselves as leaders of struggle against tyranny.

Before the Scott County Library system was established, a bookmobile went into operation on a voluntary basis.Hermetet, Stan. Eldridge, Iowa 100 Years. Eldridge: 1971. Print. The Scott County Bookmobile, Inc. was organized June 16, 1947 . Edna Spies served as the president, driver, and librarian of the organization until the March 1950. The first purchased bookmobile was a retrofitted school bus. In 1948, Scott County voters agreed to a request for tax support establishing a countywide library system. A headquarters was opened in January 1950 in the Eckermann Implement building in downtown Eldridge, with the intention that it would serve the bookmobile. The 25-by-52-square-foot space functioned as a library, and a garage was constructed for the bookmobile. Three months after the library opened, 4,000 books had been received and processed by Director Elizabeth Hage and her staff of three. The library continued to grow, registering 643 patrons by August of that year. Arrangements were made with the Scott County Bookmobile to gain access to the unit's mobile library, and by May 1950 the bookmobile began serving all 16 communities in Scott County, visiting three or more towns per day. Throughout the summer the Bookmobile had a single purpose of providing reading to adults and children in the rural communities; but in the fall through winter it serviced 110 schools throughout Scott County. Branches were established in Blue Grass, Eldridge and Princeton. The Walcott Branch was opened in 1952, and the Buffalo Branch opened in 1962. The city of Durant contracted for library services with the Scott County Library System beginning in 1966. At one time, the library also had branches in LeClaire, Long Grove, New Liberty, Park View and Ridgeview (now part of Davenport), but these have since close References \\"Branching Out- Scott County Library System.\\" North Scott Press 27 May 2009, Volume 10, Issue 2.: 11B.

The rule is useful in the study of Bayesian networks, which describe a probability distribution in terms of conditional probabilities. Chain rule for events Two events The chain rule for two random events A and B says :P(A \\\\cap B) = P(B \\\\mid A) \\\\cdot P(A). Example This rule is illustrated in the following example. Urn 1 has 1 black ball and 2 white balls and Urn 2 has 1 black ball and 3 white balls. Suppose we pick an urn at random and then select a ball from that urn. Let event A be choosing the first urn: P(A) = P(\\\\overline{A}) = 1/2. Let event B be the chance we choose a white ball. The chance of choosing a white ball, given that we have chosen the first urn, is P(B|A) = 2/3. Event A \\\\cap B would be their intersection: choosing the first urn and a white ball from it. The probability can be found by the chain rule for probability: : \\\\mathrm P(A \\\\cap B)=\\\\mathrm P(B \\\\mid A) \\\\mathrm P(A) = 2/3 \\\\times 1/2 = 1/3. More than two events For more than two events A_1,\\\\ldots,A_n the chain rule extends to the formula :\\\\mathrm P(A_n \\\\cap \\\\ldots \\\\cap A_1) = \\\\mathrm P(A_n A_{n-1} \\\\cap \\\\ldots \\\\cap A_1) \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm P(A_{n-1} \\\\cap \\\\ldots \\\\cap A_1) which by induction may be turned into :\\\\mathrm P(A_n \\\\cap \\\\ldots \\\\cap A_1) = \\\\prod_{k=1}^n \\\\mathrm P\\\\left(A_k \\\\,\\\\Bigg|\\\\, \\\\bigcap_{j=1}^{k-1} A_j\\\\right). Example With four events (n=4), the chain rule is :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm P(A_4 \\\\cap A_3 \\\\cap A_2 \\\\cap A_1) &= \\\\mathrm P(A_4 \\\\mid A_3 \\\\cap A_2 \\\\cap A_1)\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm P(A_3 \\\\cap A_2 \\\\cap A_1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\mathrm P(A_4 \\\\mid A_3 \\\\cap A_2 \\\\cap A_1)\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm P(A_3 \\\\mid A_2 \\\\cap A_1)\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm P(A_2 \\\\cap A_1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\mathrm P(A_4 \\\\mid A_3 \\\\cap A_2 \\\\cap A_1)\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm P(A_3 \\\\mid A_2 \\\\cap A_1)\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm P(A_2 \\\\mid A_1)\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm P(A_1) \\\\end{align} Chain rule for random variables Two random variables For two random variables X,Y, to find the joint distribution, we can apply the definition of conditional probability to obtain: :\\\\mathrm P(X,Y) = \\\\mathrm P(X \\\\mid Y) \\\\cdot P(Y) More than two random variables Consider an indexed collection of random variables X_1, \\\\ldots , X_n.

Recent conceptual artwork for the expansion shows several new additions and changes. Included is a new area themed to Disney's Beauty and the Beast featuring the Beast's Castle with a new dining experience, Gaston's tavern, and Belle's cottage. Restaurant ballroom scene from the 1991 film The castle features a full table service restaurant at night, and provides counter service dining by day, both requiring reservations. Cuisine is French-inspired. Three dining rooms are located within the castle, including the ballroom where Belle and the Beast danced, the West Wing where the rose is kept, and a gallery with paintings and a 7' wooden music box depicting Belle and Beast. The restaurant features baroque windows reaching the ceiling, and murals depicting the Enchanted Rose and characters from the film, including Belle, the Beast, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Lumi√®re, and Cogsworth. The restaurant was the only publicly accessible Magic Kingdom venue to serve wine and beer (available exclusively at Dinner) prior to December 23, 2016, when additional restaurants at Magic Kingdom added it to their menus. On March 20, 2015, Be Our Guest Restaurant began to serve breakfast meals featuring foods such as eggs florentine and an open-faced-egg- and-poached-bacon sandwich. Area attractions Enchanted Tales with Belle Enchanted Tales with Belle It was announced that the Beast's Castle would be included as part of a meet-and-greet with Belle. The Storytime with Belle attraction which originally was located in the Fairytale Gardens is now performed in the library inside the Beast's Castle. Guests can visit Belle's father's cottage, located at the former site of Ariel's Grotto. They can explore the home and encounter a magic mirror (a gift from the Beast) in Maurice's workshop which transports them to the Beast's Castle. Inside, they meet an audio-animatronic Madame Wardrobe who casts some guests as objects. Guests then head to the library and meet an audio-animatronic Lumiere who surprises a live Belle with guests and he will tell the classic story with help from her the selected guests. This attraction opened in December 2012. Gaston's Tavern Outside the castle and Belle's house is Gaston's tavern, another restaurant. It is themed to look like the tavern where Gaston sings his title song in the original film. The tavern features a portrait of Gaston over a large fireplace. Antlers and buckskins hang upon the wall, which is lined with barrels. Mugs and goblets can be purchased, but alcohol is not served. Gaston's serves up some of the most popular quick service dining snacks including their famous cinnamon roll. Instead, a non-alcoholic beverage has been created called \\"Lefou's Brew\\" which is an apple soda with a marshmallow foam topping, which looks like the beer served in Gaston's tavern in the film during the song. Just outside is a water fountain of Gaston, holding barrels, with his foot on Le Fou, holding mugs. Bonjour Village Gift Shop A gift shop inspired by the village where Belle lived in the film is also part of the area.

MUMCI's main goal is fostering people's interest in industry and related sciences. Besides permanent and temporary exhibitions, MUMCI offers other services, such as workshops, conferences, IMAX theatre, Ludotec, restaurant, bar, gift shop, and two parking lots. The museum was inaugurated on 30 June 2009 by Felipe Calder√≥n, President of Mexico.President Calder√≥n Inaugurates Modelo Science and Industry Museum, Gobierno Federal, Presidencia de la Rep√∫blica, M√©xico, June 30, 2009.  Features  One of the halls in the museum on beer making MUMCI is an educational space with 21 rooms. Out of them, 15 rooms show different industrial branches, including: brewing, glass, metal-mechanics, cardboard and paper, among others. MUMCI also has 6 exhibit rooms showing the human side of the industry: Industry's history and the stakeholders. All these subjects were organized using an innovative multimedia concept. Furthermore, the museum has a special area for temporary exhibitions supplementing MUMCI's contents.  History  MUMCI is the result of the humanitarian vision of Grupo Modelo, a leading company in the brewing industry. The selection process for the architectural drawings to remodel and restore the venue began in 2004. For over four years, more than a hundred experts of different industrial sectors contributed with practical and theoretical knowledge to the curatorial scripts of each room. The museographic production work immediately followed each script. With the architectural works still in progress, the mounting arrangements began in 2008 and were completed in the summer 2009, upon MUMCI's inauguration.  Building  MUMCI's venue is the building of the old brewery \\"Compa√±√≠a Cervecera Toluca y M√©xico\\", located in front of Zaragoza Garden, in Toluca's historical downtown. The property dates back to the turn of the 19th century, when one of the leading breweries during Porfirio Diaz administration was built, home to the Mexican beer with the longest tradition, Victoria Beer. The restoration works on the building began in 2007 as part of the architectural project and lay-out proposal for a museum of science and industry, presented by Architect Jos√© de Arimatea Moyao. The office building and the corridor where the educational workshops are currently located were preserved. A historical research work authorized by INAH (National Institute of History and Anthropology) was conducted to distinguish the original spaces from subsequent construction works.

Early years Annala was born in Lapua, and first came to prominence as a student at the University of Helsinki, where he edited the student union newspaper Ylioppilaslehti from 1916 to 1919.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 11 He went on to work for the Bureau of Statistics, whilst serving on the editorial staff of the conservative daily Uusi Suomi. He gained a doctorate in 1932 and became one of Finland's leading civil servants. Politics Annala joined the Lapua Movement and became Helsinki District Chairman in February 1931. Ideologically Annala was heavily influenced by the corporatism of Italian fascism.P. Davies & D. Lynch, Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right, 2002, p. 196 He supported the co-opting of the working classes into the Lapua Movement and opposed the influence of wealthy industrialists. In April 1932 Annala joined Herman Gummerus and Erkki R√§ikk√∂nen in founding the Patriotic People's Movement (IKL) and he served as caucus chairman from 1936 to 1944. Between 1933 and 1945 he also represented the party in the Parliament of Finland. Whilst the official leader was Vihtori Kosola real control of the movement rested with Annala and his close lieutenant Bruno Salmiala.F.L. Carsten, The Rise of Fascism, London: Methuen & Co, 1974, p. 168 It was Annala who dictated the policy of the movement although his hard-line views led to condemnation by both the government and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland that damaged the group. Annala held the post of Minister of Transport in the unity government of Johan Wilhelm Rangell from 1941 to 1943.Roger Griffin & Matthew Feldman, Fascism: The \\"Fascist Epoch\\", 2004, p. 174 This however was a last throw for the IKL as the group faded soon afterwards and Annala left politics.

Design The Rosario class were designed in 1858 by Issac Watts, the Director of Naval Construction. They were built of wood, were rated for 11 guns and were built with a full ship rig of sails. With a length overall of and a beam of , they had a displacement of 913 tonnes. Propulsion Rapid was fitted with a Greenock Foundry Company two-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engine driving a single screw. With an indicated horsepower of she was capable of under steam. Armament As designed ships of the class carried a single slide-mounted 40-pounder Armstrong breech-loading gun, six 32-pounder muzzle-loading smooth-bore guns and four pivot-mounted 20-pounder Armstrong breech loaders. By 1869 the armament had been reduced to a single muzzle-loading gun and two 40-pounders. Service history First Commission - Cape of Good Hope Rapid was commissioned under Commander Charles Jago at Woolwich on 12 June 1862. Commander Jago took the ship to the Cape of Good Hope Station where she remained until 1866, paying off at Woolwich on 24 January 1867. Second Commission - Mediterranean She was recommissioned at Woolwich on 14 May 1868 by Commander Francis Wood and served in the Mediterranean. While in the Mediterranean she had been converted from fully ship-rigged to barque-rigged. Her guns were reduced from eleven to three; one 7.5-ton muzzle loader and two 40-pounder Armstrong breech loaders. On 5 April 1869, she ran aground entering Malta but was not damaged. Third Commission - Mediterranean She recommissioned at Malta on 9 August 1871 under Commander Victor Montagu. In September 1875 her next captain, Commander Seymour Smith, was invalided home, being replaced by Commander Adolphus Fitzgeorge. In 1878 she was attached to the Mediterranean fleet under Geoffrey Hornby. Commander Charles Penrose- Fitzgerald took command on 4 January 1878 when she was stationed at Corfu. The island had recently been transferred from British to Greek control, which had resulted in a decline in the local economy as British forces and their funding had been withdrawn. Her Armstrong guns had a reputation amongst their crews as 'two muzzle guns, what shoots inwards', due to the unreliability of the breech mechanism. It was felt they killed more of their operators than ever those fired upon. The 7.5-ton gun was intended to fire to either side of the ship, but the spare topmast was stored on the port side of the ship, preventing the gun being fired in that direction. This difficulty was corrected by Fitzgerald once he assumed command.Fitzgerald p. 2-8 At the request of the British consul, Rapid evacuated 180 Christian women and children from Tre Scogli and Santi Quaranta villages in Albania when an attack by Turkish troops was expected. Fitzgerald was first censured for exceeding his authority in doing this by Admiral Hornby, but the Admiralty confirmed he had acted under instructions. The villagers for the most part remained destitute in Corfu for many years.Fitzgerald p. 9,10 In the autumn of 1878 Rapid was ordered to Malta for her annual refit. She was then ordered to visit Syria for the winter. The summer of 1879 was spent again at Malta refitting the ship and exchanging the crew. Fitzgerald found this trying, as his good companions with whom he had enjoyed hunting wherever the ship visited, were departing. Rapid was ordered to Constantinople for the winter, to act as guard ship for the ambassador. Each of the Great Powers kept a small warship there in attendance.Fitzgerald ch 2-6 Fate Rapid was paid off at Malta on 14 January 1881 and was broken up there in September of the same year.

The committee of experts analyzed strengths and weaknesses of their recommendations, criterion by which activities can be labeled as prohibited or permitted, cost of creating verification measures, and the degree to which measures might impact permitted research and development. Participants met in a series of four sessions from 1992-1993. In VEREX I, the first session of the committee, government experts assembled 21 potential methods for verification. Measures included surveillance, declaration of activities, and ways to inspect suspicious facilities. VEREX II focused its attention on the uses and limitations of technologies that could be used to implement the methods discussed in the previous session. The third session examined the advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods detailed in VEREX I. In September 1993, VEREX submitted its report, noting that using a combination of measures would be much more effective in enforcing the BWC than enacting any single all-purpose regulation. Delegates to the BWC responded by relegating the creation of draft proposals based upon the VEREX conclusions to be considered at the Fifth Review Conference in 2001. However, the United States firmly rejected the proposal fearing that its jurisdiction over the private sector would infringe upon biodefense research.

Upon finishing his academic studies, Goitre devoted himself entirely to choral conducting. At the beginning of the 1960s, on invitation from Marcello Abbado, he became director of the choir of the \\"Giuseppe Nicolini\\" Conservatoire in Piacenza, where he taught until his death in 1980. In the 1970s Goitre turned his attention to the musical pedagogy of Zolt√°n Kod√°ly and spent a significant amount of time in Hungary carrying out research. He also widened his knowledge of Italian and Hungarian folk tunes, which he made use of when creating exercises and examples to include in his own teaching method, the Cantar Leggendo (meaning \\"to sing whilst reading\\"), published in 1972 by the Suvini Zerboni publishing house . This method was a new way of teaching music, equally suitable for infants and adults, and was based on the idea that a child should be taught music like a language, or in other words, as a kind of musical mother tongue. Roberto Goitre founded two choirs, the Piccoli Cantori in Turin in 1972 and the Coro Polifonico Farnesiano in Piacenza in 1976. The current directors of these choirs, Carlo Pavese and Mario Pigazzini, still use the Cantar Leggendo method exclusively. Goitre dedicated all his life to musical pedagogy and choral music. It was indeed he who, at the start of the 1970s, founded the magazine La Cartellina, which is still today a very important magazine on choral music and musical pedagogy.

The castle controlled the northern end of the Crynes Corse Mounth trackway. Dating from at least the 13th century, the castle, a motte and bailey, was occupied by Alexander III and is mentioned in the Chamberlain Rolls of the time as the subject of repairs. King Edward I of England stayed one night in 1296 at the castle, during his invasion of Scotland. Durris was granted to the Fraser family by King Robert I of Scotland and created into a barony by King David II of Scotland. It was burned by the Marquis of Montrose in 1645 and not rebuilt.

His biggest success came in 1961 when he helped the Czechoslovak national ice hockey team win silver medals at the World Ice Hockey Championships in Geneva, Switzerland and in 1963 when they took bronze in Stockholm, Sweden. Altogether he played in 29 matches for the national team.  Early life  Josef Mikol√°≈° was born to a single mother and had three younger siblings. When he was a small boy, he suffered from several serious illnesses, including pneumonia and rickets. When he was five years old, he still could not walk. Despite this he later attended a coal mining apprentice school in Ostrava and worked as a coal miner after he finished it. He lived in Ostrava and started his ice hockey career here.  Ice hockey career  Josef Mikol√°≈° started playing for ice-hockey team Pracovn√≠ z√°lohy Ostrava in 1956, but soon he came to another Ostrava team, V≈ΩKG V√≠tkovice, who were playing in the Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League, the highest league in former Czechoslovakia. He quickly got recognition for both his goaltender's skills and courage with which he faced the shots, although he was not wearing any head protection in that time. In 1959 he was elected the best Czechoslovak goaltender of the season. His career culminated in 1961, when he was nominated into the Czechoslovak national ice hockey team for the World Ice Hockey Championships in Geneva, Switzerland. The team won most of the matches and surprisingly beat even the Soviet Union 6‚Äì4. They drew with Canada 1‚Äì1 and finally took silver due to Canada's better overall score. For his performance Josef Mikol√°≈° won the trophy of the Czechoslovak Sportsperson of the Year. In 1962 the World Championships took place in Colorado Springs, USA, but the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia boycotted the tournament. In 1963 they took bronze at the World Championships in Stockholm, Sweden.  Injuries  Josef Mikol√°≈° was acknowledged for his courage, with which he faced the puck although he did not wear face protection. In his time only some goaltenders experimented with home-made masks, but he refused to use any. Throughout his career he lost eight teeth and suffered a broken cheekbone, double fracture of his lower jaw and 35 sutured injuries. As the most painful he described a shot of Karel Gut, which cost him four teeth at one moment. Altogether he had about eighty stitches all over his head. He tried wearing a goaltender mask only a short time before the end of his career.  End of the career and off-ice life  Soon after the World Championships in Sweden Mikol√°≈°'s career started declining. In 1965 he got divorced and moved to Chomutov, where he got married again and played for VT≈Ω Chomutov until 1968. Then he returned to Ostrava but in 1970 he finally finished his ice hockey career and worked as a sports journalist. He had three daughters. On 20 March 2015, he died after an illness.http://www.sport.cz/hokej/ostatni/clanek/658190-zemrel-hokejista- josef-mikolas-vitkovicka-golmanska-legenda.html#hp-sez  References  Category:1938 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Czech ice hockey goaltenders Category:Czechoslovak ice hockey goaltenders Category:People from Fr√Ωdek-M√≠stek Category:Czech sports journalists Category:Sportspeople from Ostrava ","title":"Josef Mikol√°≈°"},{"id":"24380416","text":"Renovations to Zable Stadium have included replacing natural grass with FieldTurf Pro, installing lights to allow for night games and the addition of a new scoreboard (shown). The 2004 William & Mary Tribe football team represented the College of William & Mary, United States, in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I-AA (now called Football Championship Subdivision [FCS]) college football during the 2004 season. William & Mary competed as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) under head football coach Jimmye Laycock and played their home games at Zable Stadium. The 2004 Tribe football team is considered, within the William & Mary community, to be one of the two greatest teams ever assembled at the college (the other being the 2009 team). For the first time William & Mary reached the NCAA Division I-AA Semifinals. They set a single season school record for wins (11) and were A-10 Conference Co-Champions after going 7‚Äì1 in conference play. Many Tribe players garnered postseason awards and accolades, highlighted by quarterback Lang Campbell's selection as the 2004 Walter Payton Award winner, which is given annually to the most outstanding offensive player in the Division I FCS of college football as chosen by a nationwide panel of media and college sports information directors. William & Mary finished the 2004 season ranked #3 nationally in the final Division I-AA polls. No team in school history had ever finished with a ranking that high, nor had any Tribe squad even reached #3 at any point during any season. Preseason The Tribe were not nationally ranked heading into the 2004 season. Coming off of a 5‚Äì5 record in 2003 in which they had failed to qualify for the playoffs, national media did not predict much more success for them in 2004. They had lost Rich Musinski to graduation‚Äîa wide receiver who graduated as one of three players in NCAA history to collect more than 4,000 receiving yards. Though quarterback Campbell was returning for his redshirt senior season, he was not expected to lead the Tribe to the success they would later achieve. Schedule Regular season @ North Carolina The Tribe began their 2004 campaign by traveling to Chapel Hill, North Carolina to take on the UNC Tar Heels of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Over 43,500 people went to Kenan Memorial Stadium to see the match-up. Despite holding a 24‚Äì14 halftime lead, the Tribe could not hold on for the victory, losing 38‚Äì49. @ #10 New Hampshire After a bye-week, William & Mary resumed their season on September 18 against #10-ranked New Hampshire in Durham. This contest began conference play. The unranked Tribe only mustered three field goals for the match, but it proved to be enough as they came away with a 9‚Äì7 win. And, despite the lack of offense, William & Mary held the Wildcats scoreless for the last 50:48 of the game in the come-from-behind victory. Virginia Military Institute Game 3 pitted William & Mary against a lesser VMI Keydets team. They led 28‚Äì6 at halftime, and the lead bulged to 35‚Äì6 by the end of the third quarter. The Tribe won the non-conference game 42‚Äì6. William & Mary plays the Virginia Military Institute nearly every season, and consequently a friendly rivalry has spawned from it. #16 Northeastern On October 2, the #16-ranked Northeastern Huskies traveled to Williamsburg to face the unranked Tribe. The contest was evenly matched as both teams headed into halftime tied at 14. William & Mary trailed by four points going into the fourth quarter, but a field goal by All-American kicker Greg Kuehn and a receiving touchdown by future National Football League player Dominique Thompson, followed by a successful two-point conversion, provided the Tribe with 11 points in the final period. Northeastern had also scored one touchdown, and the game went to overtime knotted at 35 points apiece. William & Mary's ability to convert a field goal attempt, coupled with their defense holding the Huskies from scoring any points in the extra period, gave the Tribe a 38‚Äì35 win at home. It was the second victory over a ranked opponent by unranked William & Mary. @ Liberty William & Mary faced the Liberty Flames in Lynchburg on October 9. The Tribe scored 10 points in each of the first three quarters en route to their second non-conference win of 2004. They scored seven more insurance points in the fourth quarter to finish the game with 37 while Liberty managed only 17 of their own. The contest marked the first time of the 2004 season that William & Mary entered a game ranked in the Top 25 nationally. Heading into the game, the 3‚Äì1 Tribe were ranked #18. Rhode Island The Tribe fell behind 7‚Äì0 within the first three minutes of the game after the Rams connected on a 52-yard touchdown pass. By the end of the first quarter, however, the Tribe had scored two unanswered touchdowns of their own to take a 14‚Äì7 lead. After exchanging field goals in the second quarter, the two teams went into halftime by a score of 17‚Äì10. The Rams scored first during the third quarter when they finished their drive with a five-yard touchdown run to tie the game. After William & Mary responded with another touchdown of their own, Rhode Island kept chipping away at the defense and would eventually tie the score at 24. Once again, the Tribe responded. With 8:09 left to play, running back Elijah Brooks powered in for a score from two yards out. Neither team would score again, and William & Mary won 31‚Äì24. @ #3 Delaware In a highly anticipated match-up between two ranked teams, the #14 Tribe traveled north to Newark to play #3 Delaware. It only took 2:27 for William & Mary to score first on a 10-yard touchdown pass to Dominique Thompson. The Blue Hens only mustered a three-and-out on their first possession, and, less than one minute after their first touchdown, Lang Campbell once again found Thompson, this time for a 62-yard touchdown pass. At the 6:12 mark of the first quarter, Delaware would finally get on the scoreboard with a touchdown of their own. But as the Blue Hens soon found out, the first quarter belonged to Dominique Thompson, who hauled in his third touchdown reception, which was 87 yards, with 4:26 to play. It looked as though William & Mary would win the match in a runaway. A 17‚Äì0 shutout of the Tribe in the second quarter quickly squashed that idea, and the teams went into halftime separated by three points. The second half was a much more defensive struggle than the first, as both teams only mustered one touchdown and zero field goals apiece (both in the fourth quarter). A fast William & Mary start would not sustain, and the Blue Hens \\"upset\\" the lower-ranked Tribe 31‚Äì28. The high intensity of the game foreshadowed another great match-up to come later in the season. @ Towson Like the previous game against Delaware, William & Mary wide receiver Dominique Thompson burned the opposition in the first quarter. Less than two minutes into the game, Lang Campbell connected with Thompson on a 46-yard touchdown throw. Towson would kick a field goal, but that was all the scoring by either team for the first 15 minutes. The middle two quarters belonged to the Tribe as they scored four touchdowns and a field goal to take a 38‚Äì3 lead into the final frame. With their substitutes playing most of the fourth quarter, William & Mary gave up 13 points to the Tigers and only managed three of their own. It did not matter as they would roll to a 41‚Äì16 win. #19 Villanova On November 6, #19 Villanova traveled to Williamsburg as the #13 Tribe played their fourth ranked opponent of the season. Things did not start well for William & Mary. Wildcat Martin Gibson returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a quick touchdown. Several minutes later, however, Tribe running back Jon Smith punched in a 1-yard touchdown run of his own. A Greg Kuehn PAT was good and the two teams were tied at seven. In the second quarter, Villanova would take a 14‚Äì7 lead at the 12:38 mark on a touchdown pass. William & Mary responded four minutes later to tie the game, but another Villanova touchdown with 3:38 left would make the score 21‚Äì14 at halftime in favor of the Wildcats. In the second half, the Tribe would go on to score three unanswered touchdowns and force a safety to take a 37‚Äì21 lead. Villanova would not score again until 32 seconds remained, but by then the game was out of reach and William & Mary had earned their seventh win of the season. @ #4 James Madison Unlike the University of Richmond football rivalry, which is specific to one sport, the W&M;‚ÄìJMU athletic rivalry spans across the board to all sports. When the #10 Tribe went to Harrisonburg to play #4 James Madison, both teams were intense from the start. The first quarter was a defensive battle as neither team conceded good field position to the other. It was not until 2:49 was left that the first points were scored‚Äîa David Rabil 28-yard field goal for JMU. William & Mary tied the game with a Kuehn field goal in the second quarter, but the Dukes took a 10‚Äì3 lead with 3:19 left in the first half on a 17-yard passing touchdown. William & Mary played well in the third quarter, outscoring rival Madison 7‚Äì0. In the decisive fourth quarter, the Dukes would score first after punching in a 4-yard touchdown run. After two straight passing touchdowns by Campbell, the Tribe had taken the lead, 24‚Äì17. Madison responded to tie the match with only 45 seconds remaining after a successful 27-yard touchdown pass. Once William & Mary received the ball on the ensuing kick-off, they drove 43 yards in five plays to set up a potential game-winning field goal. After a timeout, Tribe kicker Greg Kuehn drilled a 45-yard field goal as time expired, giving William & Mary the upset win. The Tribe team and attending fans swarmed the field as they reveled in their defeat of their archrivals in dramatic fashion. Richmond (I-64 Bowl) On November 20, the Richmond Spiders came to William & Mary for the 114th all-time meeting between the teams. The winner of the annual contest‚Äîdubbed the I-64 Bowl‚Äîreceives the I-64 Trophy. Prior to kick-off, W&M; held the series edge 58‚Äì50‚Äì5. Regardless of how either team is doing in a particular season, the I-64 Bowl is always a match of pride between schools. The first quarter was relatively fruitless for both teams. The only points came on a 25-yard pass to Thompson from Campbell to cap a 9-play, 80-yard drive. After a Kuehn kick, the Tribe led 7‚Äì0. The second quarter was very similar; many plays, few points. Another W&M; touchdown and PAT capped the first half scoring. In the third quarter, however, William & Mary blew a quasi-close game wide open. They outscored the Spiders 24‚Äì0 to take a 38‚Äì0 lead into the final frame. During the third, Adam Bratton caught two touchdown passes, Joe Nicholas caught one and Greg Kuehn finished off the scoring with a field goal. Richmond would not score their first points until 5:37 left in the game when David Freeman ran in a score from 16 yards out. The Spiders would make the final score look more respectable than it was by scoring another touchdown in garbage time on a seven-yard pass with only five seconds remaining. With the win, William & Mary not only secured their 59th all-time I-64 Trophy, but also a clinch of the Atlantic 10 Conference title. NCAA Division I-AA Playoffs #11 Hampton (first round) As the 6th-ranked team nationally, William & Mary was able to host all of their playoff games (unless a higher-ranked team were to play them). In the opening round, the Tribe hosted the #11 Hampton Pirates. Hampton was able to jump on William & Mary early. Running back Ardell Daniels punched in a 1-yard touchdown score 4:01 into the first quarter to cap a four-play, 51-yard scoring drive. Several series by both teams followed, none of which resulted in any points. The Pirates would score their second touchdown with 3:31 left in the first quarter, but the PAT was blocked and the score remained 13‚Äì0. Both teams were evenly matched in the deeply contested match. The second quarter offered little offense. The only points came from the Tribe's 8-yard touchdown pass to Bratton. William & Mary was losing 13‚Äì7, in their home stadium, at the half. The second half was a much more offensively-oriented game. The Tribe received the opening kickoff, and less than two minutes later, Campbell found Thompson on a 27-yard touchdown pass. Greg Kuehn made the extra point, and William & Mary was now ahead 14‚Äì13. Hampton, however, quickly responded. Jerome Mathis returned the ensuing kickoff 93 yards for the Pirates' third score of the day. They completed a two-point conversion to take a 21‚Äì14 lead. There was one more score of the third quarter ‚Äì a 4-yard run by William & Mary's Jon Smith. The teams headed into the final 15 minutes tied at 21. Hampton once again scored first. Jerome Mathis caught his second touchdown pass when Pirates quarterback Prince Shepherd connected with him for a 43-yard score. Like Hampton had done to them earlier, the Tribe responded by returning the ensuing kickoff 92 yards for a quick score. The game was now knotted at 28 points with fewer than twelve minutes remaining. William & Mary was able to stop Hampton on the next series for a timely defensive effort. The high- scoring Tribe offense then took the field and, like many times before over the course of the season, Lang Campbell found Dominique Thompson for a touchdown pass. This time it came as the first play of scrimmage in a one-play, 45-yard pass that encompassed nine seconds. For the first time all game, William & Mary held a lead of seven points. Hampton was unable to respond. Their next offensive series produced zero points, giving possession back to William & Mary. The Tribe then took advantage of their opportunity. Smith ran in his second touchdown of the contest when he punched in a 4-yard run with only 1:58 remaining. Hampton had no choice but to use a no-huddle, hurry-up offense. They managed to complete an eight-play, 56-yard drive to score on Prince's 7-yard quarterback scurry with 32 seconds remaining. After a successful PAT, the Pirates attempted an onside kick but could not recover it. The Tribe burned the rest of the game clock and walked away with a 42‚Äì35 opening round victory‚Äîtheir first playoff win since 1996 when they beat Jacksonville State. #10 Delaware (Quarterfinals) The 2004 Division I-AA Quarterfinal match- up against the defending national champion University of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens was one of the most prolific football games in a long William & Mary history. The Tribe hosted the Blue Hens at Zable Stadium on a cold December 4 afternoon. When the double-overtime game finally ended, the Tribe had accumulated 500 yards of offense while Delaware accounted for 491 of their own. The match was also the largest come-from-behind win in Tribe history after they erased a Blue Hen 21-point fourth-quarter lead to send the game into extra sessions. Delaware opened the contest's scoring with an Omar Cuff 37-yard touchdown run 3:32 into the first quarter. A little over one minute later, Tribe quarterback Lang Campbell (30-of-53, 342 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions) would find receiver John Pitts for an 11-yard passing score to even the game at seven apiece. Cuff would score during the first quarter once more, however, as the Blue Hens took a 14‚Äì7 lead. In the second quarter, Delaware added to their lead and seemingly put the game out of reach by halftime. Blue Hens quarterback Sonny Riccio (24-of-41, 262 yards, three touchdowns, 2 INTs) connected two times for scores with David Boler in addition to a Brad Shushman field goal. William & Mary's only points came from a Greg Kuehn field goal. Delaware outscored William & Mary 17‚Äì3 during the period and took a 31‚Äì10 lead into halftime. The third quarter was a defensive battle as neither team was able to put any points on the board. The score remained a 21-point deficit for the Tribe at the start of the fourth quarter. William & Mary exploded offensively in the quarter, however, and (with a staunch defensive effort) came back to force overtime at 31‚Äì31 by putting up 21 straight points in the frame. Stephen Cason ran back an interception 62 yards for a touchdown 10 seconds into the quarter, Jon Smith scored on a two- yard touchdown run, and Campbell threw a 15-yard scoring pass to Joe Nicholas with just under two minutes to play. The miraculous comeback was not complete as the game headed into overtime. Delaware struck first when Justin Long caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from Riccio for a 38‚Äì31 Delaware advantage. The Tribe countered with a two-yard touchdown pass from Nicholas, which knotted the score at 38 apiece and set the stage for Smith's heroics in the second overtime session. Kuehn missed his first extra point of the season after Smith scored, opening the door for a Delaware victory on the ensuing possession. However, William & Mary stopped the Blue Hens on the next possession to steal the six-point win. William & Mary fans stormed Zable Stadium and celebrated on the middle of the field after the game concluded. The win also thrust the Tribe into their first-ever national semifinal playoff game, which was to be against their biggest rival, James Madison University. #8 James Madison (Semifinals) For the first time since the 1930s, William & Mary hosted a night-time football game. Using temporary stadium lights to illuminate the field and stands, the sold-out Division I-AA semifinal against James Madison was broadcast live on the ESPN2 television network. The Tribe had a six-game winning streak heading into the contest, and the Dukes had only two losses all season‚Äîone early season loss to Division I-A power West Virginia, and the other to William & Mary on a last second field goal. Whereas the Tribe won their first two playoff games at home, James Madison was forced to win both of theirs on the road. In the game's early going, all momentum and big plays were going Madison's way. They trounced William & Mary in the first quarter and went up 21‚Äì0 by virtue of rushing, passing and interception touchdowns. The game seemed out of reach for the Tribe before a blink of an eye. However, as quickly as the Dukes gained a lead, they gave it right back. In the second quarter, Greg Kuehn got the Tribe's scoring started 1:22 in with a 27-yard field goal. After a defensive stop forced Madison to punt, William & Mary went on a 68-yard, 4:41 drive to score their first touchdown (a two-yard Lang Campbell run). Another empty possession for the Dukes gave the Tribe new life as they took advantage and scored another touchdown with 2:14 remaining in the half to cut the deficit to four. After forcing a third straight punt, William & Mary capitalized for a fourth time in the second quarter as Kuehn made a 42-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. After being down 21‚Äì0 after one quarter, William & Mary crawled back to nearly even the score at 21‚Äì20. The Tribe continued their scoring in the third quarter when Campbell found Dominique Thompson for a seven-yard touchdown pass 3:23 into the half. They took their first lead of the game, 27‚Äì21. Less than one minute later, however, the Dukes responded with a two-play, 63-yard drive capped by a touchdown pass to D. D. Boxley from quarterback Justin Rascati. On William & Mary's next three possessions, they lost two fumbles and were forced to punt, giving the ball back to JMU each time. The Dukes took advantage of two of those possessions by scoring one rushing and one passing touchdown to take a 41‚Äì26 lead into the final frame. In the fourth quarter, Madison scored an insurance touchdown with 8:01 remaining when Alvin Banks punched in a one-yard run. The Tribe would not score again until a four-yard Campbell hook-up with John Pitts with 1:21 remaining in the game. In a game of runs, James Madison University would prevail to move on to the 2004 Division I-AA National Championship that they would later win, becoming the first time in history to win a national championship by defeating every team on the road. With the loss, William & Mary's record-breaking season ended, but myriad individual and team accolades were still to come.

The ranch consists of of private land and over of lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), United States Forest Service, National Park Service, and the Idaho Department of Lands.  The Ranch  Lava Lake Ranch was founded in 1999 with the purchase and consolidation of six historic sheep and cattle ranches. Brian and Kathleen Bean, the new owners, purchased these properties with the intention of producing and marketing certified organic and all-natural lamb while protecting the natural characteristics of the landscape. Their conservation efforts started with the donation of a conservation easement to the Nature Conservancy. Since that time Lava Lake has created a non-profit organization, the Lava Lake Institute for Science and Conservation to undertake conservation research. Lava Lake Lamb All of the lambs raised at Lava Lake are free range and grass-fed throughout their lives. Herders trail the sheep from the Snake River Plain of Southern Idaho north into the Pioneer and Boulder Mountains in Central Idaho, following the seasons. The lamb produced by Lava Lake has been featured in Sunset Magazine,Sunset Magazine the San Francisco Chronicle, and the New York Times Lava Lake Ranch markets their lamb primarily through their website. They are a producer member of Idaho's Bounty, a food cooperative for Central Idaho. Lava Lake Lamb can also be found in a number of restaurants in the northern Rockies.

Coffin was born in Boston and served in the navy on a number of ships during the War of Independence. He fought at Cape Henry with Arbuthnot and at St. Kitts with Hood, eventually being promoted to command a number of small ships on the American coast. Despite his rise through the ranks, he clashed occasionally with the naval hierarchy, with the first incident occurring while still a newly commissioned commander aboard . An incident over unqualified lieutenants led to his court- martial, though he was acquitted. A more serious incident occurred after the end of the war with America, when Coffin was particularly active off the Canadian coast. A charge was brought of issuing false musters, and though the practice was endemic in the navy, led to his dismissal from the ship. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Howe, then intervened to have him dismissed from the navy entirely, a decision that was later overturned by an inquiry, which set an important precedent. Restored to his rank, Coffin commanded several ships during the opening years of the wars with France, but the recurrence of an old injury forced him to move ashore. He spent the rest of the war commanding a number of dockyards, continuing to rise through the ranks, and being created a baronet for his good service. Retiring from active naval service towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars Coffin briefly changed his surname to Coffin-GreenlyHenry. A Memoir of General John Coffin. Reading, England?: S.n., 1860. Print. before reverting it, entered politics, and died with the rank of admiral in 1839. Family and early life Isaac Coffin was born in Boston, Massachusetts on 16 May 1759, into what would prove to be a strong loyalist family. He was the fourth and youngest son of the paymaster of the customs in the port, Nathaniel Coffin. His father descended from Tristram Coffin, who immigrated to Massachusetts from Devon in 1642. His mother was Elizabeth, the daughter of the merchant Henry Barnes, of Boston. He attended the Boston Latin School. He first appeared on the books of the 74-gun as an able seaman in October 1771, while Captain was at Boston under the command of Captain Thomas Symonds, and is recorded as having transferred to the brig under Lieutenant William Hunter at Rhode Island in May 1773. However it is more likely that he did not enter the service until October 1773, joining George Montagu, captain of . Montagu was the son of Rear-Admiral John Montagu, then commander in chief on the North American station. He later followed George Montagu aboard . Coffin was commissioned lieutenant on 18 August 1776 while serving aboard the brig under Lieutenant Edmund Dod at Halifax, but was not able to take up the rank immediately. Instead he joined the 50-gun as a midshipman in September 1776, the Romney then being at Newfoundland. In June 1778 he moved aboard the 50-gun , still as a midshipman. He finally received a posting as a lieutenant in October 1778, aboard the cutter . He briefly served as a volunteer aboard Captain Thomas Pasley's ship , and from there moved in June 1779 to the armed ship Pincon, serving on the Labrador coast. The Pincon was wrecked in August 1779, and in November he was moved aboard the 50-gun under Captain Gideon Johnstone as her second lieutenant. The Adamant was then being completed at Liverpool, with Coffin helping to oversee work. He was involved in a number of accidents during the final phases of work, but was able to get her ready to sail to Plymouth under a jury-rig by June 1780. He went out with Adamant to North America the following month as a convoy escort, and in February 1781 transferred to the 90-gun , flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Graves. Coffin's time aboard London was brief, and in March he moved aboard the 74-gun , under Captain Swiney. Royal Oak was the flagship of Vice- Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot at the Battle of Cape Henry on 16 March, and Coffin acted as Arbuthnot's signal lieutenant. Commands Royal Oak then returned to New York, but ran aground while passing from the North to the East River, and was badly damaged. She had to sail to Halifax for repairs, after which Arbuthnot returned to England. Royal Oak set sail to return New York in July, joining the fleet, now under Admiral Graves, on her journey. Here Coffin received news of his promotion to master and commander on 3 July, and on arriving in New York, took command of the sloop HMS Avenger. He was initially based in the North River, but in December he exchanged ships with Alexander Cochrane and took command of the 14-gun sloop Pacahunter. While aboard Pacahunter he was present during a great fire in St. John's, and helped to fight it, a service that earned him the thanks of the House of Assembly. His service aboard her was shortlived, for he and the entire ship's company volunteered to join Rear-Admiral Samuel Hood's flagship, the 90-gun . Coffin was present at Hood's attack on the French fleet under the Comte de Grasse at Basseterre, the Battle of St. Kitts, on 25 January 1782. Coffin then went on to Antigua to join his ship, travelling aboard Captain Hugh Cloberry Christian's , and in company with a frigate under Captain Henry Harvey. During the voyage the two ships ran into the French ship of the line Triomphant and the frigate Braave. The French fired upon the smaller British ships, but the latter were able to escape and arrived safely at St. John's. Coffin then went on to Jamaica where his friendship with Hood led to his promotion to post- captain on 13 June 1782 and an appointment to command the 74-gun . Clash with Rodney Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester. Coffin transported him and his family to and from Quebec, but his musters of Dorchester's sons nearly caused his downfall. It was while commanding Shrewsbury at Jamaica that Coffin had the first of a number of run-ins with naval authority that was to mark his career. The commander of the fleet, Admiral George Brydges Rodney, ordered Coffin to take three lieutenants with insufficient sea time. Coffin refused, apparently unaware that the order had come from Rodney himself, arguing that as the boys had respectively only five, three and two years service, they were unqualified to serve as lieutenants. On learning that it was Rodney's express wish that the boys be taken on as lieutenants, Coffin grudgingly acceded, but Rodney came to hear of Coffin's initial refusal, and had him court-martialed on charges of disobedience and contempt. The trial was held at Port Royal on 29 July, with Coffin being acquitted of both charges, the court determining that 'the appointment of these officers by commission was irregular and contrary to the established rules of the service.' Despite the verdict, the court did not have the power to suspend appointments made by the commander in chief, and Coffin was forced to write to the Admiralty on 20 September 1782, requesting the lieutenants' commissions be suspended. The Admiralty issued the recall of the commissions on 14 December, by which time Coffin had moved from Shrewsbury to take command of the 20-gun . Coffin sailed Hydra back to England and paid her off in March 1783. Thisbe and the Magdalen Islands Coffin was left temporarily unemployed after the end of the American War of Independence, and spent some of his time in France, where he studied the French language. He returned to service in May 1786 with an appointment to command the 28-gun . He was ordered to transport Lord Dorchester and his family to Quebec, and departed the Scilly Isles for the voyage across the Atlantic on 9 September. He arrived at the Gulf of Saint Lawrence on 10 October, and anchored at Quebec on 23 October. Coffin sailed for Halifax two days after arriving, reaching the port on 9 November, and spending the winter there. In 1787 he moved to operate in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and took a particular interest in the Magdalen Islands. He warned the governor's council that New Englanders were exploiting the fisheries in the gulf and were trading illegally with the inhabitants of the islands. Coffin, an American loyalist who had been deprived of his patrimony by the outcome of the War of Independence, was granted the islands in 1798 for his good service. His attempts to attract settlers or evict the squatters who had arrived from Saint Pierre and Miquelon were however unsuccessful. In an effort to exercise authority on his property Coffin had 1 Penny tokens made at Birmingham, England in 1815. The British government felt this was overstepping his authority and revoked his grant of the island. His long association with his estates in Canada, and his business there led to one of his obituaries noting that by the time of his death 'he had crossed the Atlantic, on service or pleasure, no less than thirty times.' Dismissal from the service While at Halifax with Thisbe, Coffin entered four boys, including two of Lord Dorchester's sons, onto the ship's books as captain's servants. The boys did not serve on the ship, and were probably still at school. Though technically prohibited, the practice of entering boys onto ships' books as a means of giving them false sea time, was widespread throughout the service, and many naval officers began their careers in this manner. Coffin was accused of knowingly signing false musters, and brought to trial by court-martial. The charge was maliciously motivated, but the court was compelled to examine the evidence. Coffin was tried aboard and the offence was proven. The offence technically required the defendant to be dismissed from the service, but considering the mitigating circumstances, the malicious nature of the charge and the fact that the practice was common in the navy, the court merely sentenced him to be dismissed from his ship. Coffin returned to Britain, whereupon the sentence came to the attention of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Howe, who insisted that the full punishment required by the 31st Article of War be carried out. Coffin was duly dismissed from the navy, though he lodged an appeal against the decision. In the meantime Coffin emigrated to Flanders and travelled as a mercenary throughout Denmark, Sweden and Russia, in search of a commission. Meanwhile Coffin's case was considered by the judges of the admiralty, on the question of whether the Admiralty had the right to set aside the judgement of a court-martial. After considering the case, they recorded that though the judgement reached in the original court- martial had not been legal, ' ... the punishment directed to be inflicted ... upon persons convicted of the offence specified in the 31st Article of War ... cannot be inflicted, or judgement thereupon be pronounced, or supplied by any other authority than that of the Court Martial which tried the offender.' In other words, Howe's decision to overrule the sentence imposed by the original court-martial was ruled invalid, and Coffin was reinstated in the service, with the payment of arrears in his wages. The judgement defined the limits of Admiralty interference with courts-martial, and became a frequently cited precedent. Return to service, and French Revolutionary Wars Coffin returned to active service during the Spanish Armament, taking command of the sixth rate in 1790. At one point Alligator was anchored at the Nore when one of her sailors fell overboard. Coffin jumped into the water to rescue him, and succeeded in recovering the man before he drowned. Coffin experienced a serious rupture while carrying out the rescue, that would dog him in later life. From the Nore he moved to Spithead, and then to Ceuta, where Alligator briefly carried the flag of Admiral Philip Cosby. Superseded by the arrival of , Alligator was sent to cruise off Western Ireland. In 1792 Coffin returned to Canada, this time to bring Lord Dorchester home. Alligator was then paid off, and Coffin, finding himself temporarily unemployed, took the opportunity to tour parts of the continent. The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 led to Coffin returning to service in command of the 36-gun . He was initially ordered to take Lord Dorchester back to Canada, but the order was later cancelled, and Coffin was compelled to transfer most of his crew to , and then re-man Melampus. Having done so, he transported armaments and stores to Guernsey in preparation for the expedition under the Earl of Moira. He was then assigned to operate in the English Channel, departing Spithead in company with to join Sir James Wallace. While sailing down the Channel the two British ships encountered a French squadron consisted of five frigates, a corvette and a cutter. The British ships were able to outmanoeuvre the French, and escaped. It was about this time that Coffin began to feel the effects of his rupture, and after over-exerting himself one night, was taken seriously ill and obliged to quit his ship. For the next four months he was virtually crippled, and never again had a seagoing command. Dockyard service Coffin was appointed regulating captain at Leith in Spring 1795, and in October that year took up the post of resident commissioner of the navy at Corsica. His business took him at times to Naples, Florence and Leghorn, and after the British evacuation of the island in 1796 he went from Elba to Lisbon, where he remained for two years. Coffin was next appointed to serve as the Navy Boards resident navy commissioner at Port Mahon Dockyard, Menorca in 1798, followed by the offer of the post at Sheerness. He went out to Halifax Dockyard as its resident commissioner for six months prior to returning and taking up the post of Resident Commissioner of the Navy at Sheerness Dockyard. Both here and at Halifax Coffin seems to have acted under the belief, strongly expressed at the time by Admiral the Earl of St Vincent, that the yard officers were corrupt. Jervis was a strong proponent of the reform of the civil administration of the navy, and Coffin acted to forcefully impose Admiralty regulations. In this he was perhaps influenced by his own experiences with Admiralty law and the rigid hierarchy within the navy, but managed to undermine the efficiency of the dockyards with his overzealous application of the regulations. He was heavily criticised at a local level, but retained Jervis's confidence, and was promoted to rear-admiral on 23 April 1804. He so upset the dock workers that a threatening letter was sent after he ordered a worker to be pressed into the navy for insolence, eventually forcing him to reverse his decision. His reputation as an effective and energetic commissioner earned him the honour of being created a baronet \\"of the Magdelaine Islands in the Gulph of St. Lawrence, British North America\\" on 19 May that year, which was followed by being created admiral-superintendent at Portsmouth Dockyard. He remained at Portsmouth until being promoted to vice-admiral on 28 April 1808, at which point he retired. Family and later life Isaac Coffin (1759‚Äì1839), Admiral of the Blue, by an unknown artist. Coffin started a family during his retirement, marrying Elizabeth Browne at Titley on 3 April 1811. Elizabeth was the heiress of William Greenly, and Isaac briefly changed his surname to Coffin-Greenly on 11 February 1811, but reverted to Coffin on 13 March 1813.R.G.T., Coffin, Sir Isacc, 1st Bt. (1759‚Äì1839), of Repham, Lincs., The History of Parliament 1790‚Äì1820 He was advanced to full admiral on 4 June 1814 and entered politics, being elected as Member of Parliament for Ilchester in 1818, and holding the seat until 1826. Greville recorded the result of one Parliamentary debate soon after his election: > The Opposition were very angry with Sir I.Coffin, who, with the candour of a > novice, had made himself informed of the facts of the petition, and finding > they were against his friends, said so in the House.Charles C. F. Greville, > A Journal of the Reigns of King George IV and King William IV, volume 1 > (London, Longmans Green & Co, 1874), at page 14 Coffin was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1832. He was a personal friend of Lord Nelson, at whose 1805 funeral he was a pallbearer.\\"Reverend John Greenly ‚Äì Battle of Trafalgar 1805.\\" Greenly Family History. N.p., n.d. Web. 24 July 2012. . He was also a friend of the Duke of Clarence (later William IV), and during the 1832 reform crisis was placed on the King's private list of those to be made peers. However, several Government ministers opposed his appointment on the grounds of his close association with his American relatives, and his name was dropped from the list. Coffin was a noted patron of charities, and a few weeks before his death donated a hundred pounds to the Royal Naval Charity, with the note that he did so 'fearful I might suddenly slip my wind, and in the hurry of my departure forget to order ... ¬£100 to be set aside'. Elizabeth Coffin died on 27 January 1839, with Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin dying six months later on 23 July 1839, at the age of 80. He was buried at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. As he had no sons, the baronetcy became extinct upon his death.  Legacy  Coffin Bay and Greenly Island in South Australia were named in honor of Sir Isaac Coffin by the British explorer Matthew Flinders in 1802.

The bifurcated needle is a narrow steel rod, approximately long with two prongs at one end. It was designed to hold one dose of reconstituted freeze-dried smallpox vaccine between its prongs. Up to one hundred vaccinations can be given from one vial of the reconstituted vaccine. The established technique is to dip the needle in the vaccine, and then puncture a person's upper arm fifteen times rapidly in a small circular area, without prior cleansing of the skin with alcohol. The needle is then disposed of. When done correctly a trace of blood appears at the vaccination site.Tucker, Jonathan. Scourge. New York: Grove Press, 2001. The bifurcated needle was created as a more efficient and cost effective alternative to the jet injector previously in use. It was invented in 1965 by Dr. Benjamin Rubin, working at Wyeth Laboratories, and was the primary instrument used during the World Health Organization's 1966‚Äì1977 campaign to eradicate smallpox. Rubin estimated that it was used to administer 200 million vaccinations per year during the final years of the campaign. After the September 11, 2001 attacks and subsequent anthrax scares, the US government ordered the smallpox vaccine be available for every person in the country.

It was created in 1972 to mitigate the wildlife resource disturbances caused by construction of the Honolulu International Airport Reef Runway. The Refuge includes three units, the Honouliuli, Waiwa and Kalaeloa. The Honouliuli and Waiawa Units are managed under a cooperative agreement with the United States Navy. The Kalaeloa Unit was established during Base Realignment and Closure proceedings in 2001. Through these cooperative efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration, the State of Hawaii, and the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service made Pearl Harbor NWR a reality. Landscape and natural resources The Honouliuli Unit contains two freshwater wetland impoundments that are intensively managed to provide habitat for a variety of waterbirds, including Hawaii's endangered waterbirds and migrant waterfowl. These two impoundments contain nesting islands, aquatic vegetation and mudflats that are used as nesting and foraging areas by various waterbird species throughout the year. The Waiawa Unit is composed of two brackish ponds, one of which is primarily managed for the endangered aeo (a subspecies of the common black-winged stilt, Himantopus mexicanus knudseni). However, the pond‚Äôs estuarine environment is ideal for establishing a host of food resources for four endangered waterbird species found there. The Kalaeloa Unit, once part of the former Barbers Point Naval Air Station, was added to the Pearl Harbor NWR to protect the endangered Ewa Hinahina (Achyranthes spledens var. rotundata) and  ªAkoko (Euphorbia skottsbergii). This area of raised limestone coral reef contains the last remaining ancient coastal dry shrubland plant communities that were once widespread throughout the Ewa Plain. It is also home to anchialine pools, which are pools of saltwater connected to the ocean via minute cracks in the limestone. These are home to the ≈çpaeula (Hawaiian shrimp, Halocaridina rubra). Native coastal plants still flourish at Kalaeloa amongst two endangered plant species. The largest population of Akoko (Euphorbia skottsbergii) on Oahu and the second largest population of endangered Ewa Hinahina can be found within this unit. Native plants include the night- blooming Maiapilo (Capparis sandwichiana) with its beautiful fragrant flowers; the Hinahina, a very dense, soft, and silky-looking plant; and Naio (Myoporum sandwicense), one of the few natives that is a strong competitor against alien grasses.

A shaft of sunlight illuminates a small area within the dark green expanse of woodsWao Kele O Puna (Wao Kele) is Hawaii's largest remaining lowland wet forest, about south of the city of Hilo, along the East Rift Zone of Kƒ´lauea volcano on the Island of Hawaii. The name means the upland rainforest of Puna. Puna is one of 9 districts on the island. Lava from Kƒ´lauea continues to flow onto forest land. In 2006, the Trust for Public Land (TPL) purchased Wao Kele, ending a twenty-year struggle to prevent tapping the sizeable geothermal energy resources that lie below it. Opponents believe that the area is the home of the fire goddess Pele. It is also known as the Puna Forest Reserve, located just east of the Puu ≈å≈ç vent. History The state of Hawaii owned Wao Kele until 1986, when the then Campbell Estate exchanged Kahaualea, an adjacent forest parcel, for it at the state's request. Campbell Estate was a private, for-profit trust set up for the heirs of Scottish-Irish carpenter James Campbell, established in 1900 and dissolved in 2007. Campbell bought more than of Hawaii land before his death. Environmentalists proposed the trade because they considered Kahaualea to be in better condition than Wao Kele. The Pele Defense Fund, however, sued, arguing that privatizing Wao Kele would end traditional hunting and gathering by native Hawaiians. The suit led to a controversial Hawaii State Supreme Court ruling that granted natives access to such private property. In the 2006 transaction, TPL paid $3.65 million for Wao Kele, $131/acre, using $3.4 million in U.S. Forest Service Forest Legacy program money, along with $250,000 from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA). TPL then transferred title to OHA. On 28 August 2007 OHA took formal ownership of Wao Kele. The office of Hawaiian Affairs acquired Wao Kele o Puna, in order to protect its natural and cultural resources as well as the traditional and customary rights of Native Hawaiians accessing the property. The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources' Division of Forestry and Wildlife is responsible for managing the land until 2017. Geothermal energy Wao Kele is licensed for geothermal energy development until 31 January 2016. As of 2009, Hawaii uses the permit only to monitor two existing geothermal wells. OHA has no plans for further development. The Hawaii Legislature has provided $2 million to plug the existing TrueMid-Pacific well with sand and concrete in 2009. The state of Hawaii has substantial geothermal resources, which could dramatically reduce fossil fuel use and energy prices there if the energy can be extracted without damage to the surrounding environment and in accordance with Hawaiian law and culture. Geologists estimate that the Big Island alone has the potential to generate 500‚Äì700 megawatts of electricity. Wao Kele came to the attention of geothermal developers after other private sites became inundated with fresh lava from Kƒ´lauea, at depths ranging up to . Developers claim that 100 megawatts of power could be generated from only 300 of the forest's nearly , enough to provide all the electricity for the island's 175,000 residents. Opponents cite the numerous health and safety problems experienced by an experimental state-run plant that closed in 1989, notably including toxic hydrogen sulfide gas emissions. A separate plant (Puna Geothermal Venture) went online in 1993 in Puna's Lower East Rift Zone and continued to generate 25‚Äì30 megawatts of electricity The natural increase in hydrogen sulfide and volcanic ash emissions due to volcanic activity within the Kilauea caldera at times produces sufficient vog to affect breathing on the nearby island of Maui. until it was closed in May 2018 due to intrusion of lava from the 2018 lower Puna eruption. The forest At , Wao Kele is Hawaii's largest lowland wet forest. It is home to numerous primary and rare plant species including hƒÅpuu ferns (Cibotium spp.), ie vines (Freycinetia arborea), and k≈çpiko (Psychotria mariniana), some of which help to limit invasive species' incursions. Opeapea (Hawaiian hoary bat, Lasiurus cinereus semotus) io (Hawaiian hawk, Buteo solitarius), common amakihi (Hemignathus virens), and nananana makakii (happy-face spider, Theridion grallator) live in the trees. There are thought to be many more as-yet-undocumented species within the forest. Wao Kele's primary forest tree is ≈çhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha). Wao Kele occupies approximately one-fifth of the watershed that feeds the Pahoa aquifer. The Wao Kele o Puna Reserve is threatened by a number of invasive species, including strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum), Molucca albizia (Falcataria moluccana), Koster's curse (Clidemia hirta), and glory bush (Tibouchina herbacea). Albizia occurs widely in the surrounding area, but is limited to a relatively small number of sites within the reserve. Large patches of strawberry guava occur within the reserve.  Myths  When Pele came to the island of Hawai'i she found that there was another god of fire currently in possession of the territory.  ªAilƒÅ ªau was known and feared by all the people residing in the area. His name, 'Ai means \\"one who eats or devours.\\" LƒÅ ªau means \\"tree\\" or \\"forest\\", therefore the God of Fire's name translated to devouring forests. Time and time again, he spread his wrath over the southern districts of Hawai'i creating the desolate lava fields. Translation of the account of Pele taking over Kilauea: > When Pele came to the island Hawai ªi, she first stopped at a place called > Keahialaka in the district of Puna. From this place she began her inland > journey toward the mountains. As she passed on her way there grew within her > an intense desire to go at once and see  ªAilƒÅ ªau, the god to whom Kƒ±lauea > belonged, and find a ÃÑ resting-place with him as the end of her journey. She > came up, but  ªAilƒÅ ªau was not in his house. Of a truth he had made himself > thoroughly lost. He had vanished because he knew that this one coming toward > him was Pele. He had seen her toiling down by the sea at Keahialaka. > Trembling dread and heavy fear overpowered him. He ran away and was entirely > lost. When he came to that pit she laid out the plan for her abiding home, > beginning at once to dig up the foundations. She dug day and night and found > that this place fulfilled all her desires. Therefore, she fastened herself > tight to Hawai ªi for all time. These are the words in which the legend > disposes of this ancient god of volcanic fires. He disappears from Hawaiian > thought and Pele from a foreign land finds a satisfactory crater in which > her spirit power can always dig up everlastingly overflowing fountains of > raging lava.

Leali's big opportunity came in 1966 when A&R; executive Ezio Leoni moved from Music record label to Ri-Fi, bringing Leali and the band Novelty with him. Leali's first success was \\"A chi\\" (\\"To whom\\"), in 1967, an Italian version of a 1954 American song \\"Hurt\\", written by Roy Hamilton, also a track released years later by singer-songwriter Francesco De Gregori. \\"A chi\\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. In the same year, Leali took part for the first time in the television festival Un disco per l'estate, with the song \\"Senza di te\\" (\\"Without you\\"), but did not progress beyond the first round. In 1969, 1971, and 1974, he appeared again in Un disco per l'estate with the songs \\"Tu non-meritavi una canzone\\" (\\"You did not deserve a song\\"), \\"Si chiama Maria\\" (\\"Her name is Maria\\"), and \\"Solo lei\\" (\\"Only you\\"). He returned to the hit parade in 1976 with the single \\"Io camminero\\" (\\"I will go\\"), which reached the top of charts, and in 1980 with a performance of Tot√≤'s song \\"Malafemmena\\" (\\"Bad woman\\" in Napolitan). In the late 1980s, he made several appearances at the Sanremo festival; in 1987, with \\"Io amo\\" (\\"I love\\"), that came in 4th; in 1988, with \\"Mi manchi\\" (\\"I miss you\\") at 5th; and in 1989, in the duet with Anna Oxa \\"Ti lascer√≤\\" (\\"I'll leave you\\") that won 1st place. The same year, Oxa and Leali represented Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest with \\"Avrei voluto\\" (\\"I wanted to\\"). The song was voted in the 9th place. Leali returned to Sanremo in 2002, with \\"Ora che ho bisogno di te\\" (\\"Now that I need you\\"), a duet with Luisa Corna, and the next year with \\"Eri tu\\" (\\"It was you\\"), which eventually went platinum. After taking part in 2006 in the Rai Due reality show, Music Farm, where he reached the finals, Leali released a new album, Profumo e Kerosene (Perfume and Kerosene), with ten new songs, all in a new for him musical style. Due to his naturally hoarse singing style, Leali was nicknamed by the Italian media Il negro bianco, \\"the white negro\\",\\"Fausto Leali, il 'negro-bianco' compie 70 anni\\" (\\"Fausto Leali, the 'white negro', is 70 years old\\"), Corriere Brescia, 25 October 2014 (in Italian)\\"Auguri a Fausto Leali, il 'Negro Bianco' compie 70 anni\\" (\\"Felicitations to Fausto Leali, the 'White Negro' is 70 years old\\"), ANSA, 25 October 2014 (in Italian)\\"Fausto Leali, i 70 anni del Negro Bianco\\" (\\"Fausto Leali, the 70 years of the White Negro\\"), Brescia Oggi, 25 October 2014 (in Italian)For the use of the term negro in Italian, see here also the title of his 1968 album. Personal life Œôn 1968, Leali married the singer Milena Cant√π, who was with the record company founded by Adriano Celentano. They had a daughter, Deborah, so named after the success of the eponymous song of that year's Festival di Sanremo, sung at the competition in a duet with Wilson Pickett (it came in fourth place).

The R&D; Tax Credit was originally introduced in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 sponsored by U.S. Representative Jack Kemp and U.S. Senator William Roth.Encyclopedia of Taxation and Tax Policy, By Joseph J. Cordes, Robert D. Ebel, Jane Gravelle, Urban Institute, pages 330-332 Since the credit's original expiration date of December 31, 1985, the credit has expired eight times and has been extended fifteen times. The last extension expired on December 31, 2014.https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f6765.pdf In 2015, Congress made permanent the research and development tax credit in a measure of the government spending bill.8 Things Congress Actually Did This Year, NPR Qualified research, history and definitions With widespread concern that U.S. economic performance had fallen well below its potential, Congress passed 'The Economic Recovery Tax Act' (ERTA) of 1981. The ERTA was intended to act as an economic stimulus that would encourage investment within the United States. Congress perceived that research spending declines had adversely affected the Country's economic growth, productivity gains, and competitiveness within the global marketplace (defined by the fall of the U.S. automaker). Included within the ERTA was a provision called the 'Credit for Increasing Research Activities' (the Credit). The Credit was tailored to reverse the decline in U.S. research spending by providing an incentive that was premised on benefiting increases in (as opposed to total) year over year research spending. Originally embodied within House Report No. 97-201 (H.R. 4242) and then later codified by The Tax Reform Act of 1986, 'Qualified Research' generally constitutes private sector or commercially driven development effort intended to yield innovation within a scientific or technological field. However, administrative difficulties coupled with divergent interpretations by the IRS and Taxpayers have led to a series of revisions to the Code Section and related Treasury Regulations. In practice, 'Qualified Research' is often reduced to a \\"Four Part Test\\" to provide a frame of reference. However, this can be misleading due to the number of requirements or elements within each \\"Test\\" and the extensive Regulations that were provided to supplement some parts of Section 41 with examples. This convention belies the need for fact intensive evaluations and documentation of taxpayer research efforts over a period of time on the business component level (see below). This evaluation can be further complicated by a large body of case law and the need to reconcile research activities with allowable expenditures. Four-part test Generally, qualified research is an activity or project undertaken by a taxpayer (directly or through direct funding of a third party on the taxpayers behalf) that comprises each of the four distinct elements: Permitted Purpose: The purpose of the activity or project must be to create new (or improve existing) functionality, performance, reliability, or quality of a business component. A business component is defined as any product, process, technique, invention, formula, or computer software (see exclusion for internal use software below) that the taxpayer intends to hold for sale, lease, license, or actual use in the taxpayer's trade or business. Elimination of Uncertainty: The taxpayer must intend to discover information that would eliminate uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of the business component. Uncertainty exists if the information available to the taxpayer does not establish the capability of development or improvement, method of development or improvement, or the appropriateness of the business component's design. Process of Experimentation: The taxpayer must undergo a systematic process designed to evaluate one or more alternatives to achieve a result where the capability or the method of achieving that result, or the appropriate design of that result, is uncertain as of the beginning of the taxpayer's research activities. Treasury Regulations define this as broadly as conventional implementation of the scientific method to something as informal as systematic trial and error process. Technological in Nature: The process of experimentation used to discover information must fundamentally rely on principles of the physical or biological sciences, engineering, or computer science. A taxpayer may employ existing technologies and may rely on existing principles of the physical or biological sciences, engineering, or computer science to satisfy this requirement. Exclusions Notwithstanding the general application and evaluation of the requirements stated above, the following do not constitute qualified research. * Research conducted after the beginning of commercial production of the business component; * Adaptation of existing business components; * Duplication of existing business components; * Reverse Engineering; * Surveys, studies, activity relating to management function/technique, market research, routine data collection, or routine testing/quality control; * Software developed for internal use except software developed by (or for the benefit of) the taxpayer primarily for the taxpayer's use in selling, general, and administrative expenses and limited to financial management functions, human resources management functions, and support service functions. * Foreign research conducted outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United States; * Research related to social sciences, arts, or humanities; * Research to the extent funded by any grant, contract, or otherwise by another person (or governmental entity). Research & Experimentation Tax Credit Calculation The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit hinges on the quantification of eligible expenses during one of three possible base periods. The three base period calculation methods are referred to as the Traditional Credit Calculation, Start-Up Credit Calculation, and Alternative Simplified Credit. Eligible expenses The eligible expenses or qualified research expenditures include four types of expenses. The quantification of each of these varies based on each company's accounting methodologies. Wages 41(b)(2)(D)Wages for in-house research and development activities usually constitute the majority of expenses eligible for the credit.Final Regulations ¬ß1.41-4: Qualified Research Expenditures Incurred After January 3, 2001For purposes of the I.R.C. ¬ß41, the term \\"wages\\" is defined by wages in I.R.C. ¬ß3401(a).Final Regulations ¬ß1.41-2: Qualified Research Expenses The research expenditure is only eligible if the wage is paid to the employee for the performance of a qualified service. Qualified Services consist of: *engaging in qualified research *directly supervising qualified research *supporting qualified research \\"Engaging in qualified research\\" means the direct conduct of research and development. \\"Directly supervising qualified research\\" is the first-line supervision of qualified research. This does not include the higher-level managers to whom the first-line supervisors report. \\"Supporting qualified research\\" includes an employee's time spent aiding the direct conduct of research and development. This includes data recording, prototype building, and performing test/trials.IRS Research Credit Audit Techniques Guide June 2005 Companies must provide contemporaneous documentation that links an employee's time directly to a project or activity. This documentation takes the form of two methods; Project Approach and Departmental Approach. The project approach relies on a taxpayer's time tracking documentation to directly link an employee's hours to a specific qualified R&D; project. The departmental approach relies on oral testimony, contemporaneous engineering documentation, job descriptions, educational background, and other information to develop a time estimate. Supplies I.R.C. ¬ß41(b)(2)(C) defines the term supply to mean any tangible property other than land or land improvements, and property subject to depreciation. Supply expense must be directly linked to qualified research activities using the taxpayer's accounting system. This can include using general ledgers or job summary reports. Qualified supplies include prototypes and testing materials. The taxpayer cannot include travel, shipping, or royalty expenses as supply expenses. Contract research I.R.C. ¬ß41(b)(2)(B) and Treasury Regulation ¬ß1.41-2(e) requires a third party to perform a qualified research service on behalf of the taxpayer; and requires the taxpayer to make payment to the third party regardless of success. The \\"on behalf of\\" is refined by I.R.C. ¬ß1.41-2(e)(3), which requires the taxpayer to have rights into the research results. The contract research payments are included at 65% of the actual expense. Basic research payments I.R.C. ¬ß41(e)(2) qualifies basic research payments made to qualified non-profit organizations and institutions. Basic research refers to fundamental research that focuses on evaluating theories and hypotheses regardless of an application. Basic research payments are included at 75% of the actual expense.Final Regulations ¬ß1.41-5: Basic Research for Taxable Years Beginning After December 31, 1986 Credit calculation The R&D; Tax Credit allows for three calculation methods based on the taxpayer's date of incorporation, initiation of qualified research, and ability to collect required contemporaneous documentation.A fourth calculation method called the Alternative Incremental Research Credit may be elected but this method has largely become obsolete due to the inclusion of the Alternative Simplified Credit in the code. The Traditional Credit Calculation and Start-Up Credit Calculation provide a credit of 20% of the taxpayers qualified research expenditures that exceed a calculated base amount. The Alternative Simplified Credit Calculation provides a credit of 14% of the taxpayer's qualified research expenditures that exceed a calculated base amount. Regardless of calculation method the base amount cannot be less than 50% of the taxpayer's current year qualified expenditures. The following sections describe the three calculation methods; Traditional Credit Calculation, Start-Up Credit Calculation, and Alternative Simplified Credit.Final Regulations ¬ß1.41-3: Base Amount Calculation Traditional credit calculation I.R.C. ¬ß41(c)(3)(A) establishes a fixed-base percentage calculation for companies that incorporated prior to January 1, 1984 and had 3 or more tax years with qualified research expenditures and revenue between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1988. The fixed-base percentage is calculated by dividing the taxpayers aggregate qualified research expenses by the aggregate gross receipts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983, and before January 1, 1989. For purposes of the calculation, the resulting fixed-base percentage is multiplied by the average of the taxpayer's gross revenue for the 4 years prior to the calculation year. The fixed-base percentage should only change for purposes of meeting the consistency rule or adjusting for an acquisition or disposition. Start-up credit calculation I.R.C. ¬ß41(c)(3)(B) establishes a fixed-base percentage calculation for companies that incorporated after December 31, 1983, or had fewer than 3 years with qualified research expenditures and revenue between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1988. The fixed-base percentage is calculated according to the code as follows. :¬ß41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(I) 3 percent for each of the taxpayer's 1st 5 taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993, for which the taxpayer has qualified research expenses, :¬ß41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(II) in the case of the taxpayer's 6th such taxable year, 1/6 of the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the 4th and 5th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such years, :¬ß41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(III) in the case of the taxpayer's 7th such taxable year, 1/3 of the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the 5th and 6th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such years, :¬ß41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(IV) in the case of the taxpayer's 8th such taxable year, 1/2 of the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the 5th, 6th, and 7th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such years, :¬ß41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(V) in the case of the taxpayer's 9th such taxable year, 2/3 of the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such years, :¬ß41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(VI) in the case of the taxpayer's 10th such taxable year, 5/6 of the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses of the taxpayer for the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such years, and :¬ß41(c)(3)(B)(ii)(VII) for taxable years thereafter, the percentage which the aggregate qualified research expenses for any 5 taxable years selected by the taxpayer from among the 5th through the 10th such taxable years is of the aggregate gross receipts of the taxpayer for such selected years. For purposes of the calculation, the resulting fixed-base percentage is multiplied by the average of the taxpayer's gross revenue for the 4 years prior to the calculation year. The fixed-base percentage should only change for purposes of meeting the consistency rule or adjusting for an acquisition or disposition. Alternative simplified credit For those companies that cannot adequately substantiate qualified research expenditures for the Traditional or Start-Up calculation methods, or generate fixed-base-percentages that significantly limit the credit, the I.R.C. ¬ß41(c)(5) provides an alternative calculation method. This calculation provides a credit equal to 14 percent of the current year qualified research expenses that exceed 50 percent of the average qualified research expenses for the 3 preceding taxable years. As of January 1, 2009, this calculation supplanted the Alternative Incremental Research Credit election. Since this calculation method is an election, a taxpayer may not apply for this calculation method retroactively.Need reference Additionally, I.R.C. ¬ß41(c)(5)(C) states this election applies to all of the taxpayer's future claims unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary. Special rules To further supplement the calculation methods and definitions of qualified research and experimentation, the R&D; Tax Credit provides special rules for various situations. The following sections briefly describe some of these special rules.Final Regulations ¬ß1.41-6: Aggregation of ExpendituresFinal Regulations ¬ß1.41-7: Special RulesFinal Regulations ¬ß1.41-8: Special Rules for Taxable Years After November, 2006 Consistency rule In order to accurately calculate a credit, the taxpayer is required to define qualified research expenditures the same from year to year, per I.R.C. ¬ß41(c)(5)(A).Research Credit Audit Techniques Guide May 2008 If a taxpayer changes their definition of qualified expenditures due to the results of an audit, tax court case ruling, or publication of an IRS document, the tax payer must accordingly change their definition for prior years that will affect the results of one of the three calculation methods. I.R.C. ¬ß280C election I.R.C. ¬ß280C(c)(3) allows the taxpayer to elect a reduced credit amount thereby eliminating the requirement to deduct qualified research expenditures claimed for the R&D; Tax Credit. This election can only be made on a timely return. Returns/Refund Claims Containing Invalid IRC 280C(c)(3) Elections' Controlled groups A group of corporations that maintain more than 50% common ownership are treated as one taxpayer for purposes of the R&D; Tax Credit. Special brother/sister and spouse rules factor into determining ownership.Internal Revenue Code ¬ß41 Carry-forward and carry-back The credits generated for the I.R.C. ¬ß41 can be carried forward 20 years and may be carried back 1 year. R&D; Tax Credit Monetization Companies can monetize the federal R&D; tax credit in a few different ways. Traditionally, it is taken against income taxes. However, qualified small businesses can apply up to $250,000 to payroll taxes each year. To qualify for the payroll tax offset, a business must have less than $5 million in revenue and be within five years of its first gross receipt.https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small- businesses-self-employed/qualified-small-business-payroll-tax-credit-for- increasing-research-activities Legislation The legislative intent for the R&D; Tax Credit is to increase R&D; spending in the United States. Currently separate bills are being proposed in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives bill, cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Kendrick Meek and Kevin Brady, H.R. 422 proposes to make the credit permanent and increase the Alternative Simplified Credit from 14% to 20%.H.R. 422:To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the research credit through 2010 and to increase and make permanent the alternative simplified research credit. Senators Max Baucus and Orrin Hatch are cosponsoring bill S. 1203. This bill proposes to make the credit permanent, increase the Alternative Simplified Credit from 14% to 20%, and terminate the other calculation methods.S. 1203:Grow Research Opportunities With Taxcredits' Help Act In the 112th Congress, Representative Rush Holt is sponsoring H.R. 134 to make the R&D; Tax Credit permanent.:HR 134 The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014 (H.R. 4438; 113th Congress) was introduced into the House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify the calculation method and the rate for the tax credit for qualified research expenses that expired at the end of 2013 and would make that modified credit permanent. The bill was supported by organizations such as the National Taxpayers Union and Americans for Tax Reform, but was opposed by the Obama Administration because it did not pay for the credits with any offsets. Economic effect of the credit The magnitude of the R&D; Tax Credit's economic effects are debated by many economists but a majority of them agree the credit does increase R&D; spending in the United States. While measuring the actual effect of the credit is difficult, a 2005 study by Ernst & Young measured the amount of dollars returned to companies in the form of the R&D; Tax Credit.Supporting innovation and economic growth, Prepared by Ernst & Young LLP for the R&D; Credit Coalition, April 2008 *17,700 corporations claimed $6.6 billion in R&D; Tax Credits on their tax returns in 2005.

Biography   Early life  Hand was born in Saint Ste. Marie, the son of Thomas A. Hand and Hannah Jane Hand.  Military service  Hand joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force on April 7, 1916. Soon, he was sent to France's Western Front. Hand began his victory roll while flying a Sopwith Camel for 45 Squadron. He tallied his first win when he drove an Albatros D.V down out of control at Langemark-Poelkapelle, Belgium on 15 November 1917. After 45 Squadron shifted from the Western Front to Italy, Hand had a couple of unconfirmed claims on 11 January 1918; he then scored four times between 30 January and 9 May 1918. A summary of his victories shows four destroyed enemy airplanes, one confirmed and two unconfirmed driven down out of control. On 1 June 1918, Hand was shot down by Austro-Hungarian ace Frank Linke-Crawford. Linke-Crawford hit the gas tank of Hand's Camel and set it afire; somehow, Hand survived both the flames and the impact of the crash. However, he was badly burned and taken prisoner.  Later life  Hand was repatriated in 1919 and returned to Canada. He became a magistrate. He also helped found the Toronto Flying Club.

He was originally from Sharazora region in Sulaymaniyah province in Iraqi Kurdistan, was raised in Mosul and then resided in Damascus, where he died. Early life Birth Ibn al-·π¢alƒÅ·∏• was born in the year 1181 CE/577 AH in Sharazor. Education He first studied fiqh with his father in Sharazor, located in the south-eastern part of what is currently referred to as Iraqi Kurdistan. He then occupied himself in Mosul for an unknown period of time, studying under a number of local religious scholars. He studied in a number of cities, including: Baghdad, Hamedan, Naysabur, Merv, Aleppo, Damascus and Harran. Ibn Khallikan said that he had heard that Ibn al- ·π¢alƒÅ·∏• had repeatedly read al-Muhathab, one of the primary texts of the Shafi'i Madh'hab, \\"before his mustache had grown.\\" He read Sahih al-Bukhari upon two of his teachers, al-Mayyad ibn Muhammad al-Tusi and Mansur ibn 'Abd al-Mun'im al-Furawi, as well as Al-Sunan al-Kubra, by al-Bayhaqi, upon the latter. Scholarly career Scholastic specialization While Ibn al-·π¢alƒÅ·∏• was most recognized for his contribution to the field of hadith, he was well- grounded in a variety of disciplines. Ibn Khallikan described him as being from amongst the exemplary scholars of Quranic exegesis, hadith and jurisprudence, participating in a number of religious disciplines and producing sound religious verdicts. Al-Fasi described him as being \\"a master in both jurisprudence and hadith, and other than that.\\" He was also described by al-Dhahabi as \\"strong in the Arabic Language\\" and as \\"the shaikh of the Shafi'i scholars.\\"Duwal al-Islam, vol. 2, pg. 159, Dar Sadir, Beirut, first edition, 1999. Ibn al-Hajib described Ibn al-Salah as being broad in his knowledge of both primary issues (al-usul) and peripheral (al-furu\`). Positions Ibn al-·π¢alƒÅ·∏• held several positions throughout his life, primarily in the field of education. He taught at the Salahiyyah School in Jerusalem, and then, following the destruction of its city walls, moved to Damascus and taught at the Rawahiyyah School for some time following its inception. Following the foundation of Dar al-Hadith Ashrafiyyah, he became its shaikh and was the first to teach and give verdicts there in the year 530 AH. It was here that he dictated his work Introduction to the Science of Hadith to his students. He was then appointed a teacher at the al-Shamiyyah al-Sughara School. Students Ibn al-Salah had a number of students, some of whom achieved prominence in their own right; from them: * Ibn Khallikan * Ibn Razin * Kamal Ishaq * Kamal Salar * Shams al-Din \`Abd al-Rahman Nuh al- Maqdisi * Shihab al-Din Abu Shamah Theological position Ibn al-·π¢alƒÅ·∏• clarified his position on philosophy, describing it as: \\"The basis of foolishness and degeneration, a topic of confusion and misguidance which is motivated by perversion and blasphemy. Whosoever engages in philosophy, has been blinded in his insight into the great aspects of the Sharia corroborated by evidences.\\" Due to his insistence no one was allowed to read the subjects of rhetoric or philosophy in Damascus, a matter which the leaders supported. Death Ibn al-·π¢alƒÅ·∏• died on Monday, September 18, 1245 CE/643 AH, at the age of 66. His funeral prayer was performed at the congregational mosque of Damascus, to a crowd so large it required a second prayer to accommodate. He was buried in the Sufiyyah graveyard, now the location of a hospital, a mosque and other buildings. Works Ibn al-Salah had a number of works the most notable named below in addition to others on individual issues. # Introduction to the Science of Hadith ‚Äì perhaps his best known work; # Ishkalat 'ala al- Wasit, also called Mushkil al-Wasit ‚Äì which comprised brief comments on various subjects primarily in the first fourth of al-Wasit in Shafi'i fiqh which appeared in a large, single volume # Al-Amaali ‚Äì the transcription of the hadith he read aloud to his students, complete with the chains of narration;Al-Risalah al-Mustatrafah, by al-KattƒÅnƒ´, pg. 159-61. # Siyanah Sahih Muslim ‚Äì an explanation of Sahih Muslim of which only the beginning segment is published which al-Nawawi referred to in his own explanation # Numerous fatawa', or religious rulings, described by Abu Shahbah as having \\"much benefit\\" # Fawa\`id, or benefits, from his travels which consisted of a number of volumes of unusual points of interest in various disciplines which he collected during his travels to Khurasan # Adab al-Mufti wa al-Mustafti‚ÄîThe Etiquette of the One Giving a Verdict and of the One Seeking a Verdict # Nukat \`Ala al-Muhadhdhab # Tabaqat al-Fuqaha al-Shafi\`iyyah a collection of lesser known Shafi\`i scholars of jurisprudence which al-Nawawi abridged and added to.

Other methods of ferric nitrocarburizing include gaseous process such as Nitrotec and ion (plasma) ones. The processing temperature ranges from to , but usually occurs at . At this temperature steels and other ferrous alloys are still in a ferritic phase, which is advantageous compared to other case hardening processes that occur in the austenitic phase.. There are four main classes of ferritic nitrocarburizing: gaseous, salt bath, ion or plasma, and fluidized- bed.. The process is used to improve three main surface integrity aspects including scuffing resistance, fatigue properties, and corrosion resistance. It has the added advantage of inducing little shape distortion during the hardening process. This is because of the low processing temperature, which reduces thermal shocks and avoids phase transitions in steel.. History The first ferritic nitrocarburizing methods were done at low temperatures, around , in a liquid salt bath. The first company to successfully commercialize the process was the Imperial Chemical Industries in Great Britain. ICI called their process \\"the cassel\\" due to the plant where it was developed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt2DU-22qus or \\"Sulfinuz\\" treatment because it had sulfur in the salt bath. While the process was very successful with high- speed spindles and cutting tools, there were issues with cleaning the solution off because it was not very water soluble.. Because of the cleaning issues the Joseph Lucas Limited company began experimenting with gaseous forms of ferritic nitrocarburizing in the late 1950s. The company applied for a patent by 1961. It produced a similar surface finish as the Sulfinuz process with the exception of the formation of sulfides. The atmosphere consisted of ammonia, hydrocarbon gases, and a small amount of other carbon-containing gases.. This spurred the development of a more environmentally friendly salt bath process by the German company Degussa after acquiring ICI patents. Their process is the widely known as the Tufftride or Tenifer process. Following this the ion nitriding process was invented in the early 1980s. This process had faster cycle times, required less cleaning and preparation, formed deeper cases, and allowed for better control of the process.. Processes Despite the naming the process is a modified form of nitriding and not carburizing. The shared attributes of this class of this process is the introduction of nitrogen and carbon in the ferritic state of the material. The processes are broken up into four main classes: gaseous, salt bath, ion or plasma, or fluidized-bed. The trade name and patented processes may vary slightly from the general description, but they are all a form of ferritic nitrocarburizing.. Salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing Salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing is also known as liquid ferritic nitrocarburizing or liquid nitrocarburizing. and is also known by the trademarked names Tufftride and Tenifer.. The simplest form of this process is encompassed by the trademarked Melonite process, also known as Meli 1. It is most commonly used on steels, sintered irons, and cast irons to lower friction and improve wear and corrosion resistance... The process uses a salt bath of alkali cyanate. This is contained in a steel pot that has an aeration system. The cyanate thermally reacts with the surface of the workpiece to form alkali carbonate. The bath is then treated to convert the carbonate back to a cyanate. The surface formed from the reaction has a compound layer and a diffusion layer. The compound layer consists of iron, nitrogen, and oxygen, is abrasion resistant, and stable at elevated temperatures. The diffusion layer contains nitrides and carbides. The surface hardness ranges from 800 to 1500 HV depending on the steel grade. This also inversely affects the depth of the case; i.e. a high carbon steel will form a hard, but shallow case. A similar process is the trademarked Nu-Tride process, also known incorrectly as the Kolene process (which is actually the company's name), which includes a preheat and an intermediate quench cycle. The intermediate quench is an oxidizing salt bath at . This quench is held for 5 to 20 minutes before final quenching to room temperature. This is done to minimize distortion and to destroy any lingering cyanates or cyanides left on the workpiece.. Other trademarked processes are Sursulf and Tenoplus. Sursulf has a sulfur compound in the salt bath to create surface sulfides which creates porosity in the workpiece surface. This porosity is used to contain lubrication. Tenoplus is a two-stage high-temperature process. The first stage occurs at , while the second stage occurs at .. Gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing Gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing is also known as controlled nitrocarburizing, soft nitriding, and vacuum nitrocarburizing or by the tradenames UltraOxhttps://www.ahtcorp.com/services/nitriding-and- nitrocarburizing/ultraox/>, Nitrotec, Nitemper, Deganit, Triniding, Corr-I- Dur, Nitroc, NITREG-C and Nitrowear, Nitroneg.. The process works to achieve the same result as the salt bath process, except gaseous mixtures are used to diffuse the nitrogen and carbon into the workpiece.. The parts are first cleaned, usually with a vapor degreasing process, and then nitrocarburized around , with a process time that ranges from one to four hours. The actual gas mixtures are proprietary, but they usually contain ammonia and an endothermic gas. Plasma-assisted ferritic nitrocarburizing Plasma- assisted ferritic nitrocarburizing is also known as ion nitriding, plasma ion nitriding or glow-discharge nitriding. The process works to achieve the same result as the salt bath and gaseous process, except the reactivity of the media is not due to the temperature but to the gas ionized state..An Introduction to Nitriding p. 9MINIMIZING WEAR THROUGH COMBINED THERMO CHEMICAL AND PLASMA ACTIVATED DIFFUSION AND COATING PROCESSES by Thomas Mueller, Andreas Gebeshuber, Roland Kullmer, Christoph Lugmair, Stefan Perlot, Monika Stoiber In this technique intense electric fields are used to generate ionized molecules of the gas around the surface to diffuse the nitrogen and carbon into the workpiece. Such highly active gas with ionized molecules is called plasma, naming the technique. The gas used for plasma nitriding is usually pure nitrogen, since no spontaneous decomposition is needed (as is the case of gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing with ammonia). Due to the relatively low temperature range ( to ) generally applied during plasma-assisted ferritic nitrocarburizing and gentle cooling in the furnace, the distortion of workpieces can be minimized. Stainless steel workpieces can be processed at moderate temperatures (like ) without the formation of chromium nitride precipitates and hence maintaining their corrosion resistance properties. Postoxidation black oxide An additional step can be added to the nitrocarburizing process called postoxidation. When properly performed, postoxidation creates a layer of black oxide (Fe3O4), that greatly increases the corrosion resistance of the treated substrate while leaving an aesthetically attractive black color. Since the introduction of the Glock pistol in 1982, this type of nitrocarburizing with postoxidation finish has become popular as a factory finish for military style handguns. Uses These processes are most commonly used on low-carbon, low-alloy steels, however they are also used on medium and high-carbon steels. Common applications include spindles, cams, gears, dies, hydraulic piston rods, and powdered metal components.. Glock Ges.m.b.H., an Austrian firearms manufacturer, utilized the Tenifer process until 2010, to protect the barrels and slides of the pistols they manufacture. The finish on a Glock pistol is the third and final hardening process. It is thick and produces a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating via a nitride bath. The final matte, non-glare finish meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications, is 85% more corrosion resistant than a hard chrome finish, and is 99.9% salt-water corrosion resistant. After the Tenifer process, a black Parkerized finish is applied and the slide is protected even if the finish were to wear off. In 2010 Glock switched to a gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing process. Besides Glock several other pistol manufacturers, including Smith & Wesson and Springfield Armory, Inc., also use ferritic nitrocarburizing for finishing parts like barrels and slides but they call it Melonite finish. Heckler & Koch use a nitrocarburizing process they refer to as Hostile Environment. Pistol manufacturer Caracal International L.L.C. uses ferritic nitrocarburizing for finishing parts such as barrels and slides with the plasma-based post oxidation process (PlasOx). Grandpower, a Slovakian firearms producer, also uses a quench polish quench (QPQ) treatment to harden metal parts on its K100 pistols.

Over time, federal statutes and Supreme Court rulings have designated more or less power to tribal governments, depending on federal policy toward Indians. Numerous Supreme Court decisions have created important precedents in Indian country jurisdiction, such as Worcester v. Georgia, Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, and Montana v. United States. History There have been many shifts in policy towards Indian Jurisdiction in the history of the United States. There are six major periods of policy regarding American Indians. The first is the British Colonial and Early U.S. Era, which was followed the Removal Era. The next period was the Allotment Era. The Reorganization Era was next and then the Termination Era. The last era is the one we are currently in, the Self- Determination Era. Different U.S. Supreme Court cases and Congressional rulings have shifted United States policy regarding Indian Jurisdiction, creating the different eras. Colonial and early U.S. policy The British passed the Proclamation of 1763 which created a boundary line between the British colonies and the American Indians lands west of the Appalachian Mountains. The proclamation forbade the British colonists from moving beyond the proclamation line into Indian Territory. Important legislations passed by the United States Congress in early United States history were the Indian Intercourse Acts. They were passed in 1780, and then they expired and were renewed every two years until 1802, when permanent legislation was passed. The final Indian Intercourse Act was passed in 1834. These acts did many things, including regulating relations between Indians and non-Indians living on Indian land and defining \\"Indian Country.\\" Removal After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the United States began to extensively negotiate with the Indians in this newly acquired territory. U.S. citizens saw the land as being very fertile and as if it was theirs for the taking and because of this many land disputes arose between Indians and non-Indians in this region.Canby 2004, p. 14 The first case that allowed the American seizure of Indian lands was Johnson v. McIntosh, which stated that when a European nation discovered land in the new world, that it also gained the right to take the land from the natives by purchase or by conquest.Canby 2004, pp. 14‚Äì15 At this time, states wanted to remove Indians from their territory, which led to more treaties and the establishment of the controversial policy of U.S. ethnic cleansing. These feelings resulted in the Indian Removal Act, when Congress authorized President Andrew Jackson to take land away from Indians and give them land in the West. It was the Indian Removal Act that helped Jackson set into place the Trail of Tears in 1831. Alice Fletcher is seen here talking with Chief Joseph at the Nez Perce Indian Reservation in Idaho. She arrived in 1889 to implement the Dawes Act. The man kneeling is Fletcher's interpreter. Allotment In the 1870s and 1880s there was an increasing amount of disapproval in regard to the government's reservation policy. People were seeing the Indians in two different ways. One group saw the Indians as a group of people living in poverty and shambles, while another group saw the Indians as a group of people causing large tracts of land to be excluded from white settlers.Canby Jr., William C. American Indian Law. St. Paul: West, 2004. Print. Page 20 The combination of the two groups of people and their points of view led to the production of the General Allotment Act of 1887, also known as the Dawes Act. Allotments of 160 acres were handed out to each head of a family. Double amounts were handed out if the land was to be used for grazing.Canby 2004, p. 21 could also be given to each additional member of the household. The government would retain the title handed out through the General Allotment Act for 25 years.Canby 2004, p. 21 This time period intended on doing two things. First, it would protect the allottee from immediately having to pay state taxes. Second, the land owner would learn how to manage his land and affairs.Canby 2004, p. 22 However, after the 25 years was up, many Indians found themselves subject to excessive state property taxes, which resulted in the sale of much of the land which Indians received through the Dawes Act.Canby 2004, p. 22. Very soon after many of the Indians losing the land which they earned through the Dawes Act, white settlers moved in on these open lots. This created a checkerboard effect, and made it nearly impossible to have sizable gains in farming and grazing.Canby 2004, p. 23. The Indian Allotment Act had disastrous effects on the Native Americans. During the Allotment Act, the Native American population reached its lowest point in history. in 1900, the Native American population in the United States was only 250,000.\\"Native Americans of North America.\\" Encarta. 2009. Web. 16 Oct. 2009. There was also a substantial decrease in the amount of land owned by Native Americans. In 1887 the Indians had held . By 1934, the amount of land held by Indians had dropped to , and of that over was desert.Canby 2004, p. 22 Reorganization The Allotment period was coming to a close in 1924 when Congress passed a statute granting citizenship to all Indians born within the United States.Canby 2004, p. 23 In 1928 the famous Meriam Report was released. The Meriam Report documented the utter failure of the Dawes Act and the allotment policy. The passage of the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934 officially marks the beginning of the Reorganization period. The Indian Reorganization Act ended the practice of allotment. It sought to protect the tribes and allow them to establish the legal structures for their own self- governments.Canby 2004, p. 24 The tribes were now authorized to create their own constitutions and laws, which could be ratified by a vote among the tribal members. After decades of misfortune and loss of culture and property, the Indian Reorganization Act put a stop to the destruction of the tribes.Canby 2004, p. 25 Termination, 1953-1964 Unclear jurisdictional boundaries between states and tribes prompted the beginning of the Indian termination policy era.Philip, Kenneth R. Termination Revisited. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1999, 140-149. The termination era began when Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 108 in 1953, which stated: > Whereas it is the policy of Congress, as rapidly as possible, to make the > Indians within the territorial limits of the United States subject to the > same laws and entitled to the same privileges and responsibilities as are > applicable to other citizens of the United States, to end their status as > wards of the United States, and to grant them all the rights and > prerogatives pertaining to American citizenship.... The policy of termination has been seen as a direct attack on the sovereignty of Indian nations - without being considered a reservation or a nation, Indian tribes lost jurisdiction, taxation protection, and were emerged them into a different world. The Bureau of Indian Affairs attempted to prevent termination for some tribes by insisting the need for governmental assistance for tribes such as the Potawatomi Tribe of Kansas: > They ... have failed to acquire the necessary ambition, providence, and > sense of responsibility to rise above their economic level.Orfield, Gary. A > Study of the Termination Policy. Denver, Colorado: National Congress of > American Indians, 1964, 6. Efforts from the BIA did not stop the process of termination. In the twelve years of this policy, 109 tribes were terminated, with severe effects on education, health care, and economic stability. Cold War policies likely affected the policy of termination. Several reservations and nations enacted social programs, such as health care, on their citizens and socialism was easily connected with the Soviet Union. This fear likely drove Congress to move towards termination.Philip, Kenneth R. Termination Revisited. Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1999, 171. Termination might have been seen as a method of \\"freeing\\" tribes from the BIA and other governmental programs, but the policy likely hindered the efforts of Native Americans for tribal self-rule. Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon would lead the nation away from termination into self-determination. Self- determination The policy of termination was ultimately recognized as a failure by the late 1960s, and federal policy regarding Indians shifted toward that of self-determination, or the right of a group or nation to independently govern themselves. The legislation that has arisen from this policy of self- determination, which has been in effect since the late 1960s to the present day, has greatly influenced modern-day Indian country jurisdiction. One example of this legislation is the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, which imposed most of the requirements of the Bill of Rights on the tribes and amended Public Law 280.Canby 2004, p. 30 This legislation both broadened and restricted tribal jurisdiction. The passage of the Act rejected the termination policy by requiring constitutional procedure by the tribal government, but it also limited tribal jurisdiction by limiting the independence of tribal government.Canby 2004, pp. 30, 137 The Civil Rights Act of 1968 also amended Public Law 280 so that states no longer held civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian country unless the tribes consented at certain elections.Canby 2004, p. 30 Also, in relation to the extension of state law into Indian country, in the 1983 Supreme Court case, New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe (462 U.S. 324, 334, 1983), it is held that state jurisdiction is permitted to interfere in tribal self-government in circumstances where \\"the state interests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion of state authority\\".Canby 2004, p. 144 In National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe (471 U.S. 845 1885), a case involving civil jurisdiction in Indian country, the Supreme Court held that parties must first exhaust tribal court remedies before seeking federal court review of such questions.Canby 2004, p. 147 The 2001 case Nevada v. Hicks (533 U.S. 355) further limited Indian country jurisdiction by holding that inherent tribal jurisdiction does not extend to state officials who commit crimes on reservation trust lands.Duthu 2008, p. xix  Present day jurisdiction  This map shows Indian reservations in the United States. These territories are defined as Indian country. Contemporary Indian country jurisdiction has been shaped over the years by the rulings of many Supreme Court cases and federal statutes involving criminal and civil jurisdiction within Indian country. Today, the jurisdiction of Federal, state, or tribal courts usually depends upon whether the parties involved are considered to be Indians or tribal members, the nature of the offense, and whether the events of the case took place in Indian country.Canby 2004, p. 125 Though the definition varies, a person is usually considered an Indian if he or she has some Indian blood and is considered an Indian by the community. Blood requirements may vary from state to state, but often it is enough to have a parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent qualify as an Indian. To be identified as an Indian for federal and statutory purposes, however, a person must be a member of a federally recognized tribe.Canby 2004, pp. 8‚Äì9 Indian Country, as defined by Congress in 1948 (18 U.S.C.A. 1151) is: a) \\"all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of way running through the reservation, b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the U.S. whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a state, and c) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights of way running through the same.\\" This definition of Indian country includes all territory within an Indian reservation, even land owned by non-Indians in fee simple. Reservation land opened to settlement by non- Indians is still considered Indian country, unless Congress explicitly states its decision to remove the lands from reservation status and hence diminish the Indian country boundaries. Diminishment may occur in other ways, yet retain the meaning of Indian Country. For example, when the Devils Lake Sioux litigated the question of tribal authority against the North Dakota Public Service Commission, which was operating within reservation borders, the court, relying in part on interpretations of 'Indian Character', ruled that the tribe had no authority over privately held lands even though more Indians than non- Indians lived on the reservation, yet more acreage was held in non-Indian ownership. Many tribes, such as the Yakama in Washington state, have designated 'open' and 'closed' areas, reflecting this difference in the interpretation of jurisdiction. All of the political and legal interpretations of this situation may not eliminate the meaning of Indian Country, but as such they obscure the increasing diminishment of tribal sovereignty within reservation borders.Wishart, David J., and Froehling, Oliver, \\"Land Ownership, Population and Jurisdiction: the Case of the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe v. North Dakota Public Service Commission,\\" American Indian Culture and Research Journal, 20(2): 33‚Äì58 (1996).  Division of criminal and civil jurisdiction in Indian country   Federal jurisdiction  Some federal criminal statutes are applicable throughout the entire nation, including Indian country, and apply to both Indians and non-Indians, such as treason, theft involving the U.S. mail, the Organized Crime Control Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act. The General Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1152) and the Major Crimes Act, (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1153) encompass other crimes and determine the jurisdiction when concerning particular cases.Canby 2004, p. 153 The General Crimes Act of 1817 provides for the prosecution of crimes by non-Indians against Indians and of non-major crimes by Indians against non-Indians through the application of federal law. There are three exceptions to the Act, in which it does not apply to the following: crimes by Indians against Indians, crimes by Indians that received punishment through the tribe, and crimes in which a treaty gives exclusive jurisdiction to the tribeCanby 2004, p. 156 The Major Crimes Act of 1885 establishes federal jurisdiction in the prosecution of serious crimes committed by Indians in Indian country.Duthu, Bruce N. American Indians and the Law. New York, NY. Penguin Group (USA) Inc., 2008 pg. xvi Federal civil jurisdiction is very limited in Indian country. Federal courts have jurisdiction in claims that arise under federal law and in cases of diversity of citizenship.Canby 2004, p. 217 Federal courts have no jurisdiction in civil cases involving divorce, adoption, child custody, or probate.Canby 2004, p. 224  Tribal jurisdiction  Tribal criminal jurisdiction over Indians in Indian country is complete and exclusive unless there is a federal statute deeming it otherwise or limiting it in some way.Canby 2004, p. 170 Exclusive jurisdiction is given to the tribal courts over non-major crimes committed by Indians against Indians in Indian country, as well as victimless Indian crimes. Jurisdiction is also granted, though not exclusively, to tribal courts over non-major crimes by Indians against non-Indians. In these cases, federal courts also have jurisdiction through the General Crimes Act, so jurisdiction is shared.Canby 2004, p. 171 Tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction in civil cases against any Indian in Indian country. This includes cases brought against an Indian by a non-Indian in Indian country, and all cases between tribal members that arise in Indian country.Canby 2004, p. 199 Exclusive jurisdiction over tribal subject matter also belongs to the tribal courts. In divorce cases, tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over divorces between Indians living in Indian country.Canby 2004, p. 211 In some divorce cases involving Indians living outside Indian country, the tribal and state courts may have concurrent jurisdiction.Canby 2004, p. 212 The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 provides for tribal jurisdiction in adoption and custody cases of Indian children who are domiciled in Indian country. Children ultimately take the domicile of their parents, and children born to unwed parents take the domicile of their mother.Canby 2004, p. 214 Tribal courts also exercise jurisdiction in adoption and custody matters of Indian children who are tribal members. In cases involving probate, tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over non-trust movable assets of Indians residing in Indian country.Canby 2004, p. 215  State jurisdiction  States have limited criminal jurisdiction in relation to crimes committed in Indian country.Canby 2004, pp. 178-179 In general, states exercise limited civil jurisdiction in cases involving non-Indians, and sometimes non-tribal members, when these cases arise in Indian country. In divorce cases, states have jurisdiction if both parties are non-Indian and living in Indian country.Canby 2004, p. 194 In matters involving adoption and child custody proceeding between parents, the division of jurisdiction is very similar. The states only have jurisdiction over cases involving the adoption and custody of Indian children not domiciled in Indian country.Canby 2004, p. 196 In probate cases, states have jurisdiction regarding cases of non-trust estates of Indians who died while they were domiciled outside of Indian country and also in cases dealing with any land outside of Indian country.Canby 2004, p. 198 See also *Aboriginal title in the United States *Former Indian reservations in Oklahoma *Indian country *Native American reservation politics *Off-reservation trust land *Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Area *Tribal sovereignty in the United States Notes References *Canby Jr., William C.

It was in college that his passion for music began to grow, and after serious consideration, he left his studies to focus on the growing tribal and house music scene emerging in New York during the late 1990s.Interview-Hector Fonseca: Getting in with the Grammy's from themovementz.com 30 October 2007interview: DJ Hector Fonseca from ChicagoPride.com 30 May 2008 With his experience and a loyal following of fans, word of mouth began to circulate throughout New York's music scene of Hector's rising stock. Soon, he could boast of residencies at most of New York City's legendary nightclubs such as the Limelight, Heaven, Splash & Roxy, along with numerous national gigs. With a list of venues that read like a who's who of city nightclubs, he soon attracted the attention of his mentor, the late Grammy Award-winning DJ/producer/remixer Peter Rauhofer. Rauhofer, the founder and proprietor of dance music label, Star69 Records, wanted to verify whether or not Fonseca's musical means extended beyond the turntables. In the summer of 2004, with just two years of producing music under his belt, Fonseca solidified his spot in dance music's hall of fame with his rendition of Jahkey B's single, \\"Heart Attack\\". His remix of the song pushed the song to the #8 spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart.

He appeared in 236 La Liga matches over nine seasons, seven of those spent with Espanyol. He also represented in the competition Rayo Vallecano and Atl√©tico Madrid. Toni helped Spain win the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Club career Born in La Garriga, Barcelona, Catalonia, Jim√©nez had a stint with local giants FC Barcelona's third team to kickstart his senior career. He made his professional debut with neighbours UE Figueres on loan, being backup then first-choice for two Segunda Divisi√≥n seasons. In 1992, Jim√©nez moved to Rayo Vallecano after terminating his previous contract with Real Zaragoza. Initially a backup to Wilfred Agbonavbare, he benefitted from an injury to the Nigerian in the second round to make his La Liga debut against CD Logro√±√©s, although he finished the campaign on the bench again. The following year, Jim√©nez accompanied coach Jos√© Antonio Camacho to RCD Espanyol, then in the second level. He was an undisputed starter during his six-year spell, winning the Ricardo Zamora Trophy in his first season, qualifying for the UEFA Cup immediately afterwards and amassing nearly 300 overall official appearances. Jim√©nez signed for Atl√©tico Madrid in 1999, being highly unsuccessful there during three years. Barred by Jos√© Francisco Molina in his first season, the team from the capital were also relegated; furthermore, in that year's Copa del Rey final, against former side Espanyol, he was stripped off the ball by former teammate Ra√∫l Tamudo's head for the final 1‚Äì2. Jim√©nez again regained first-choice status at Elche CF, but returned to the top flight and Espanyol in January 2003 when new boss Javier Clemente requested his signing. At the end of the following campaign, he retired from the game at almost 34; he stayed connected with the latter in directorial capacities, leaving in March 2006 when director of football Crist√≥bal Parralo also resigned. Jim√©nez served his first coaching spell also in Catalonia, as assistant in Girona FC. In May 2009 he returned to the club as goalkeeper's coach and, two years later, signed with Espanyol as assistant to Mauricio Pochettino; the pair linked up again in January 2013, after the latter was appointed at Southampton. In late May 2014, both Pochettino and Jim√©nez signed for another team in the Premier League, Tottenham Hotspur. International career Jim√©nez had not yet played top level football when he was summoned by coach Vicente Miera to the 1992 Summer Olympics, in local Barcelona. He beat competition from Santiago Ca√±izares, until then the starter, and played all the matches and minutes en route to the gold medal. Additionally, Jim√©nez won three caps for the full side during one year, his first one being offered by Camacho, a friendly with Italy on 18 November 1998 (2‚Äì2, in Salerno). He seemed poised to be called as third-choice for UEFA Euro 2000, but 19-year-old Iker Casillas was chosen instead.

She was originally ordered during the American War of Independence but was completed too late to see service during the conflict. Instead she had an active career during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Commissioned during the last few years of peace prior to the outbreak of war with France, Alligator served in British waters, making trips as far afield as the Mediterranean and the North American coast. During the period of conflict that began in 1793, Alligator spent a considerable amount of time in the West Indies under a number of commanders, and was effective in anti-privateer operations. Despite this she was laid up for a period starting in 1795, and was reduced to a 16-gun troopship in 1800. Further service followed in the West Indies, supporting the fleet and army movements around the islands, and taking part in the capture of several French frigates. She was again laid up, and as the end of hostilities approached, was deemed surplus and was sold in 1814. Construction and commissioning Alligator was one of the third batch of Enterprise-class ships to be ordered by the Admiralty, with the contract to build her being awarded to Philemon Jacobs, of Sandgate on 7 May 1782. She was laid down there in December 1782 and launched on 18 April 1787. With there being no immediate need for a large number of ships in the navy after the end of the war with America, Alligator was gradually completed between 20 April 1787 and 18 July 1790, at first at Deptford Dockyard and then at the civilian yards of Randall & Co, at Rotherhithe. She cost a total of ¬£2,771 with ¬£4,330 spent on fitting costs and expenses incurred at Deptford. She commissioned under her first commander, Captain Isaac Coffin in June 1790. Interwar years Coffin commissioned Alligator during the period of tensions known as the Spanish Armament and commanded her over the three years leading up to the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France. At one point, while Alligator was anchored at the Nore, one of her crew fell overboard. Coffin jumped into the water to rescue him, and succeeded in recovering the man before he drowned, but in doing so experienced a serious rupture while carrying out the rescue, that would dog him in later life. From the Nore Coffin moved to Spithead, and then to Ceuta, where Alligator briefly carried the flag of Admiral Philip Cosby. Superseded by the arrival of , Alligator was sent to cruise off Western Ireland. In 1792 Coffin sailed to Canada and returned carrying Lord Dorchester. Alligator then underwent a refit at Deptford for ¬£2,895 and recommissioned in December 1792. French Revolutionary Wars From February 1793 her commander was Captain William Afleck, who served briefly in the North Sea, achieving success against French privateers in the region. On 12 February 1793 he captured the Sans Peur, followed by the Prend Tout on 21 February. Afleck left Britain bound for the Leeward Islands on 18 March 1793. He stopped at Halifax, where the schooner joined him. From there they sailed, with three transports carrying an artillery detachment and 310 troops primarily from the 4th Regiment of Foot, all under the command of Brigadier General James Ogilvie, to St Pierre and Miquelon on 7 May. They captured Saint Pierre on 14 May without firing a shot. They also captured 18 small vessels carrying fish, and two American schooners with provisions and naval stores. joined them a day later and then sailed to Miquelon to complete the conquest. Prize money for the capture of the islands was paid in October 1796. On 11 December 1793, Alligator captured the French ship Triomphant in St Marks Bay, in the island of Hispaniola. Next, Alligator captured the French 14-gun Libert√© near Jamaica on 28 March 1794. On 14 June, Alligator was among the vessels that participated in the capture of Port-au-Prince. In October that year command passed to Captain Thomas Surridge. Captain Thomas Afleck succeeded Surridgein January 1795, and paid Alligator off the following month. Alligator was laid up at Portsmouth for five years, until being refitted there as a 16-gun troopship between February and March 1800. She was recommissioned in February under Captain George Bowen, under whom she took part in operations off Egypt during the French campaign there. While supporting the landing of troops in Abu Qir Bay had one man killed and three wounded. On 17 July she recaptured the Anchor. Because Alligator served in the navy's Egyptian campaign between 8 March 1801 and 2 September, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 to all surviving claimants. Captain Philip Beaver took over command in May 1802. He remained Alligators captain until she was recommissioned in May the following year under Commander Richardson. In April 1803, however, Alligator was sailing from Gibraltar to Britain in company with and the store ship Prevoyante when they sighted two French ships of the line off Cape St. Vincent. The French ships veered off rather than engage the British vessels.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 9, p.337. Later that year Alligator went out to the Leeward Islands and on 27 September was one of a number of ships that captured the 18-gun Dutch ship at Demerara. Napoleonic Wars Commander Robert Henderson was in command between 1804 and 1805, during which time Alligator was one of several ships to chase down and capture the 32-gun Proserpine at Surinam on 6 May 1804. Alligator formed part of Commodore Samuel Hood's squadron at the capture of Surinam River in 1804. The squadron consisted of Hood's flagship , Pandour, , , , Drake, and transports carrying 2000 troops under Brigadier-General Sir Charles Green. Both British and Dutch casualties were light.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.288-90. In November, Alligator recaptured from a French privateer the Danish brig Hoff, which was carrying a cargo of slaves. On 24 June 1805, Alligator captured the Spanish brig Santo Chritle, which was carrying brandy from Spain to Havanna. Henderson was succeeded by Commander Augustus Collier in 1806, who returned her to the Leeward Islands. There in March 1806 she came under the command of Captain Hugh Pigot. Fate Captain Robert Bell Campbell replaced Pigot from 1807. Campbell returned Alligator to Britain, where she was laid up at Plymouth in April 1807. She was offered for sale there on 21 July 1814 as the Napoleonic Wars drew to a close. She was sold that day for the sum of ¬£1,760.

It stars Luc Merenda,NoShame Films DVD Case, 2005. Last accessed: September 2008. Enrico Maria Salerno, Dayle Haddon and Corrado Pani. Gambling City is one of several European heist films produced in response to the popular success of American films in the genre like The Sting (1973). The film features many of the genre's standard conventions, including a Byronic hero who acts as a social bandit by practicing confidence tricks, the hero's forbidden love with a socially repressed damsel in distress (who may or may not exhibit facets of the femme fatale) and a morally corrupt dandy as villain and the hero's foil. The film was co-written by Martino and Ernesto Gastaldi, and produced by Luciano Martino. Plot Gambling City's story centers on the exploits of master poker player and card sharp Luca Altieri (Merenda); Altieri begins working for underground illegal gambling kingpin \\"The President\\" after running a scam at a high-stakes poker table in The President's casino; soon after entering The President's employ, however, Altieri enters into a violent competition with The President's hot-tempered, self-entitled son and heir, Corrado (Pani), for the hand of Corrado's girlfriend, Maria Luisa (Haddon). Opening Scenes Gambling City opens with Altieri entering an illegal gambling parlor in Milan and taking a seat beside several tuxedoed patrons at its high-roller table. In contrast to his slickly attired opponents Altieri is dressed in a threadbare cardigan and slacks and has a carnation in his lapel. Noticing the newcomer's obvious lack of means at a table where a single chip is worth 10,000 lira, one player asks Altieri if he has enough money to back his bets. To this Altieri responds, \\"Win or bust.\\" Altieri then proceeds to execute his scam by initially pretending to be a poker novice. He fumbles his cards and requests a re-deal despite his having four-of-a-kind queens, explaining that he doesn't trust receiving such a strong hand so early. Within minutes he has fleeced his fellow players, and while waiting to make his exit via elevator, he reveals his scheme to a security guard standing beside him. In response, the security guard tells Altieri the elevator is not an exit at all and escorts the scamp into it. They then take the elevator to the casino's basement where Altieri meets The President, Corrado and Maria Luisa. Production According to Roberto Curti, Martino's contributions to the scrip were \\"just nominal\\". Ernesto Gastaldi stated that he \\"wrote the script with Enrico Maria Salerno in mind as theboss of a sharp - and not just violent - criminal organization which has succession problem when the son shows he's not cut from the same cloth as his father.\\" Gastaldi considers the script he wrote to be one of his best efforts, but stated that \\"I believe the actors were very good on this film, improving upon a story that, although not very original, was rather different from crime films of that era.\\" Gambling City was shot at Dear Studios in Rome and on location in Milan and Nice. Release Gambling City was released on January 23, 1975 in Italy where it was distributed by Medusa. The film grossed a total of 777,334,540 Italian lire on its theatrical run. The film released on Region 0 NTSC DVD by NoShame films in 2005 as part of the \\"Sergio Martino Collection.\\" The DVD is currently out-of-print.NoShame Films DVD Case, 2005. Last accessed: September 2008. Reception Gambling City received little attention in the European or American press at its release, but experienced a revival in interest when now- defunct Italian cult-film company NoShame Films re-released it on DVD in 2005. At the time of its re-release New York Times reviewer Dave Kehr noted the \\"powerful, rhythmic sense of violence\\" the film shares with other Martino films. But Kehr's review primarily focused on the film as an early example of Martino's talents. Kehr praised the absolute lack of sentimentality displayed by a director who would go on to make over 50 feature-length films, including spaghetti westerns like A Man Called Blade (1977) and science-fiction fantasies like 2019: After the Fall of New York (1983). Since the film's release on DVD, however, no other mainstream critics have commented on it, and what attention it has received from the blogosphere has been mostly negative. TwitchFilm.net reviewer \\"logboy\\" called it \\"a fairly odd experience,\\" but qualified his disparagement with, \\"It has its saving graces in amount substantial enough to make it an interesting experience in many isolated regards.\\" And Gambling City critic Matt Hwang called the film's score \\"something between the distorted wind-up chime of a broken Jack-in-the-Box and the Merry-go-Round accordion.\\"  See also  * List of Italian films of 1975 Footnotes References * External links * Category:1975 films Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:1970s crime thriller films Category:1970s action thriller films Category:Poliziotteschi films Category:Films directed by Sergio Martino Category:Gambling films Category:Films with screenplays by Ernesto Gastaldi ","title":"Gambling City"},{"id":"24381588","text":"Liquid nitriding may refer to: *Salt bath nitriding *Salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing ","title":"Liquid nitriding"},{"id":"24381598","text":"Hogwarts Express is a fictional train in J.K.

Looney Tunes short directed by Chuck Jones, written by Michael Maltese and starring Hubie and Bertie in their first pairing with the redesigned Claude Cat (an early, primordial version of the cat appeared in 1943's The Aristo-Cat). The cartoon was released on April 23, 1949. The short centers around Hubie and Bertie's attempts to move into a new home by chasing Claude out of the house. Mel Blanc voices Bertie and an uncredited Stan Freberg voices Hubie. The title is a pun on house wrecker or home wrecker, where a house is destroyed, often figuratively, by a single person. Mouse Wreckers was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for 1948, Retrieved on May 9, 2011. but lost to The Little Orphan, a Tom and Jerry cartoon which was the fifth Oscar (of seven) given to the cat and mouse team. The cartoon was loosely remade as Gopher Broke in 1958 (with the Goofy Gophers and the Barnyard Dawg), and later as the Tom and Jerry cartoon The Year of the Mouse in 1965 (also written by Maltese and directed by co-writer Jones). Plot Scouting out a new home, Hubie calls over Bertie, who begins to gaze into it before Hubie slaps Bertie to make him realize that before they can move in, the cat Claude, who has an award for Best Mouser - 1948 (along with other mouser awards), must be removed first. Realizing that the task may not be easy, Hubie comes up with several ways to chase Claude out, all of which are designed to drive him crazy, having Bertie do each of the tricks. First, Hubie lowers Bertie down the chimney on a fishing line. At the bottom of the chimney, Bertie grabs a piece of wood, smacks Claude in the head with it, and is then quickly yanked back up the chimney. When Claude just goes back to sleep, unable to figure out what happened, Bertie is lowered again, pumping air into Claude. When Bertie is yanked back up the chimney and the pump is released, Claude ends up flying all over the living room, hitting all of the walls and ceiling before landing hard on the pillow on which he was resting. Claude then takes the bottle of catnip he had hidden in an overhead lamp, tosses it out the window, and inaudibly mutters the Pledge of Sobriety. With the logs removed from the fireplace, Hubie lowers Bertie and a dog (resembling Hector the Bulldog) in a doghouse down the chimney. While the dog is sleeping, Bertie pulls out the dog's lower lip such that it snaps back on him, but not before Bertie is pulled back up the chimney. Seeing only Claude, the dog viciously beats up Claude before returning to the doghouse, with the doghouse then yanked up the chimney. Completely nerve-wracked as a result of the beating, Claude then runs to the bathroom to take a dose of nerve tonic. While Claude is in the bathroom, Bertie then inserts a lit firecracker into Claude's pillow, which blows up after he returns to it. When Claude finds his arm has feathers, he frantically runs back to the bathroom to check himself, all the while the feathers fly off him when he runs. Claude finds himself without any feathers on and on his arm, then nervously gulps down the remainder of the nerve tonic. Next, Bertie returns down the chimney and runs a piece of string throughout the house, zig-zags through piles of dishes, out of it into a water catch drain, down a ladder, and then back into the house with the other end of the string attached to a rock on top of the chimney. Once Bertie ties the end of the string to Claude's tail, Hubie tosses the rock down the other side of the chimney, which sends Claude flying throughout the house, out of it and back into it, and eventually slamming him into a trash can lid, which begins to drive Claude crazy by flicking his lips up and down. Claude then reads \\"Psychology of Dreams\\" by Sigmund Fried for advice on dealing with what Claude thinks are bad dreams. When Claude falls asleep, Bertie places earmuffs over his ears, while Hubie and Bertie work on nailing everything that would be in front of Claude that was on the floor in the living room to the ceiling, and painting the ceiling like the floor and vice versa. When Claude wakes up, he sees this and thinks he is on the ceiling (when he is really on the floor) and jumps up to what he thinks is the floor (which is really the ceiling). Claude is surprised when he grabs a bottle of nerve tonic, only to open it and see it \\"rise\\" to the floor. Claude then becomes confused when he enters into the kitchen, where everything is still right-side up. Further driving Claude mad is when he looks out one window where an illusion is given to make Claude think he is upside down (it is actually a painting turned upside down and held by the mice), and then looks out another to make him think he is sideways (another painting turned sideways and also held by the mice), and then out a third to make him believe that the house is under water (in actuality, there is a fish tank on a small ladder outside that window). Finally broken, Claude runs, screaming, from the house and hides in a nearby tree, trembling in the leaves. Having accomplished their mission, Hubie and Bertie return down the fireplace and roast cheese over an open fire as the cartoon fades out.

He has written six international bestsellers: The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Strategies of War, The 50th Law (with rapper 50 Cent), Mastery, and The Laws of Human Nature. Early life The younger son of Jewish parents, Greene grew up in Los Angeles and attended the University of California, Berkeley before finishing his degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a B.A. in classical studies. Before becoming an author, Greene estimates that he worked 80 jobs, including as a construction worker, translator, magazine editor, and Hollywood movie writer. In 1995, Greene worked as a writer at Fabrica, an art and media school in Italy, and met a book packager named Joost Elffers. Greene pitched a book about power to Elffers and wrote a treatment which eventually became The 48 Laws of Power. He would note this as the turning point of his life.Perlroth, Nicole.

The Art of Seduction Greene's second book, The Art of Seduction, was published in 2001. The book profiles the nine types of seducers (e.g. The Rake, The Siren, and The Charmer) and details aspects of attraction, authenticity, storytelling, and negotiation. Greene uses examples from historical figures such as Cleopatra, Giacomo Casanova, Duke Ellington and John F. Kennedy to support the psychology behind seduction. The Art of Seduction is mentioned in Neil Strauss' book The Game as a recommended book in the seduction community. It has sold more than 500,000 copies.Robert Greene Interview, Part 1. Power Seduction and War. July 7, 2006. The 33 Strategies of War The 33 Strategies of War is the third book by Greene and was published in 2007. The book is divided into five parts: Self-Directed Warfare, Organizational (Team) Warfare, Defensive Warfare, Offensive Warfare and Unconventional (Dirty) Warfare. The book is a guide to the campaign of everyday life and distills military wisdom from historical figures like Napoleon Bonaparte, Sun Tzu, Alfred Hitchcock, Alexander the Great and Margaret Thatcher. The Sunday Times called the book \\"an excellent toolkit for dealing with business and relationships,\\" and The Independent claims that Greene is \\"setting himself up as a modern-day Machiavelli\\" but that \\"it is never clear whether he really believes what he writes or whether it is just his shtick, an instrument of his will to shift ¬£20 hardbacks.\\" NBA player Chris Bosh stated that his favorite book is The 33 Strategies of War. It has sold more than 200,000 copies. The 50th Law The 50th Law is the fourth book by Greene‚Äîwritten collaboratively with rapper 50 Cent‚Äîand was published in 2009. The book mixes talk of strategy and fearlessness by supplementing anecdotes from 50 Cent's rise as both a young urban hustler and as an up-and-coming musician with lessons from various historical figures. Each of the 10 chapters in the book explains a factor of fearlessness and begins by telling how 50 learned this \\"Fearless Philosophy\\" in Southside Queens.

The Laws of Human Nature Greene's sixth book, The Laws of Human Nature , was released in October 2018. The book examines people's conscious and unconscious drives, motivations, and cognitive biases. Influence and controversy The 48 Laws of Power has been referenced in songs by Jay Z, Kanye West, and Drake. Busta Rhymes used The 48 Laws of Power to deal with problematic movie producers. Greene has claimed former Cuban President Fidel Castro had also read the book. The 48 Laws of Power is one of the most requested books in American prison libraries.The Readers Behind Bars Put Books to Many Uses New York Times, October 19, 2010 Several American prisons have banned The 48 Laws of Power and The 33 Strategies of War. Greene's books are sometimes described as manipulative and amoral. The Sunday Times noted that The 48 Laws of Power has become the \\"Hollywood back-stabber's bible\\" and that although the book is reportedly used by some business executives, it is difficult to find people who publicly acknowledge its influence because of the book's controversial nature. \\"Despite Greene's obvious influence, most Hollywood executives are coy about admitting it. Jonathan Baker, marketing manager for Sony Pictures Entertainment, says the book is often used by executives he knows, \\"but because of its nature, you won't find a lot of people who will own up to how important a resource it has become for them. Acknowledging its influence can be damning; you are opening yourself up to being judged in a negative way. But I don't mind saying that I stumbled on it in a very down period in my life, and it gave me a lot of clarity when I needed it most\\". Greene responds to this sentiment by stating, \\"These laws‚Ä¶ people might say, 'Oh they're wicked', but they're practiced day in and day out by businesspeople. You're always trying to get rid of your competition and it can be pretty bloodthirsty, and that's just the reality.\\" Greene's work has been featured in The New York Times, USA Today, CNN, The New Yorker, Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times, Forbes, Huffington Post, Business Week, Business Insider, Fast Company, Slate, and XXL. Greene has also appeared on The Today Show, CNBC, ABC, and MTV News. Personal life Greene lives in Los Angeles with his girlfriend Anna Biller, who is a filmmaker. Greene can speak five languages and is a student of Zen Buddhism. He is an avid swimmer and mountain biker. Greene suffered a serious stroke before launching his new book The Laws of Human Nature in 2018. It was caused by a blood clot in his neck and has currently left him without the use of his left hand and leg. https://twitter.com/RobertGreene/status/1041728219987238912/photo/1 Bibliography *1998 The 48 Laws of Power (with Joost Elffers) *2001 The Art of Seduction *2006 The 33 Strategies of War *2009 The 50th Law (with 50 Cent) *2012 Mastery *2018 The Laws of Human Nature References External links * Power, Seduction and War Robert Greene's Blog Category:1959 births Category:American social sciences writers Category:Jewish American writers Category:Living people Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:Writers from Los Angeles Category:20th-century American male writers Category:21st-century American male writers Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American male non-fiction writers ","title":"Robert Greene (American author)"},{"id":"24381676","text":"is a railway station, jointly operated by Fukui Railway and the Echizen Railway, located in the city of Fukui, Fukui Prefecture, Japan.

The Petit Albert is possibly inspired by the writings of Albertus Parvus Lucius (the Lesser Albert.)https://library.hrmtc.com/tag/albertus-parvus- lucius/http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/pageturn.html?id=MEDREN_9962936093503681 Brought down to the smallest hamlets in the saddlebags of peddlers, it represents a phenomenal publishing success, despite its association with \\"devil worshippers\\"‚Äîor rather thanks to it. It is associated with a second work, the Grand Albert. It is a composite, even heterogeneous work, and perhaps a bric-a-brac, collecting texts of unequal value written by (or attributed to) various authors; most of these authors are anonymous, but some are notable such as Cardano and Paracelsus. It is a relatively old text, in which even the attribution to Albertus Magnus is dubious. Coupled with the fact that it quotes from so many later sources, this makes it an ethnological document of the first order. Grand Albert and the Petit Albert Under the aegis of the Grand Albert The Little Albert is generally mentioned at the same time as the Grand Albert, another grimoire. The Little Albert, however, is neither a summary nor an abridged version of the Grand Albert; it is a separate text, as can be seen in a comparison of the two works by Claude Seignolle in a French work titled, Les √âvangiles du Diable (in English: The Gospels of the Devil). The author of these two works, or at least the Grand Albert, is in theory Albertus Magnus, born about 1193, theologian, Sorbonne University professor. \\"Albertus Magnus\\" (or, in English, literally, \\"Albert the Great\\") was canonized. The Place Maubert (etymologically Place of the \\"Master Albert\\") in Paris is named after him. The text of Secrets merveilleux de la magie naturelle et cabalistique du Petit Albert that was published by Chez les Heritiers Beringos in 1752 specifically credits authorship to Alberti Parvi Lucii. In Tarl Warwick's 2016 English translation, the warning to the reader says: \\"Here is a new edition of the Wonderful Natural Secrets of the Little Albert, known in Latin by the title Libellus Alberti Parvi Lucii of mirabilibus Arcanis naturae: the author was one of those noble and wise men accused of witchery by the ignorant masses; (it was formerly the fate of all the great minds who possessed something extraordinary in science, as they were treated like magicians.)\\" The writings of Master Albert were obviously not printed in his day, as he died (in 1280) before the invention of the printing press (circa 1440). The earliest known edition appeared in France in 1706 and was published by \\"Chez les Heritiers Beringos\\" in Lyon, which represents a gap of more than 400 years between the estimated date of writing and that of printing, a range of time that opens up many possibilities for the evolution of the text. In fact, the publishing company that printed it was fictional. According to the historian Owen Davies, to publish controversial and even illegal grimoires under the \\"Chez les Heritiers Beringos\\" was a common tactic in the 18th and 19th centuries, as grimoires became increasingly censored by the Catholic Church. The location of the publisher was described as being at the \\"sign of Agrippa.\\" The fact that the Big and the Little Albert are named after Albertus Magnus is a claim that should not be taken literally. In spite of this article's name, it is extremely important to note that the text actually contains references known to be by authors posterior to the Master Albert, like Paracelsus, very largely quoted. Furthermore, there are mentions of events which occurred after the time of the Master Albert. By placing themselves under the aegis of Albert the Great, these works seek recognition and legitimacy. This practice of collective attribution to one great person in history was common practice in the time of the first printing of the Petit Albert. It is not comparable to modern falsification or plagiarism. Far from it, and far from any motive of willful deceit, it was regarded as a way to pay homage while also giving cover to the writers of controversial topics. From 1850, the Grand and the Petit Albert are published under the following titles: # Le Grand Albert et ses secrets merveilleux (the Grand Albert) # Les secrets mystiques de la magie naturelle du Petit Albert # Le Dragon Rouge (also known as the Grand Grimoire) These three works were collected in a grand three- volume work published in Paris in the 1860s, entitled Le Grande et Veritable Science Cabalistique. Reactions of the Church The reaction of the Catholic Church in the 19th and early 20th centuries was negative. The Church held that the combination of the two \\"Alberts\\" was itself a form of black magic. So those who read them, did so in secret, hid them under a beam in the attic, and sometimes wondered which of the neighbors could own a copy. Even some of those who were good Christians tried to bless the book in secret by hiding it under the tablecloth of the altar. Priests knew about this practice. They inspected the possible hiding places before mass and made the \\"Albert\\" disappear if they found one. Legends about the Albert flourished. It was said that the devil tries to take back his books and that destroying an Albert was too dangerous for an individual to accomplish safely. With the goals of safety and salvation in mind, the presence of an Albert should be confided to a priest. The attitude of the Church after the French Revolution contrasts with the fact that the book had a long editorial life by no means clandestine since successive editions were published in Lyon under the Ancien R√©gime, and even before the Age of Enlightenment, when the Church had every latitude to ban it. The book was indirectly censored from 1793 to 1815 when peddling literature was prohibited; evidently the Church was not involved in this decision. Editorial phenomenon The two Alberts, sold by peddling and inseparable from the Almanac (with astrological calendar, another great success of the popular edition) made the fortune of their publishers, since, according to Seignolle, it sold 400,000 a year in the Belgian Ardennes alone.Claude Seignolle, Les √âvangiles du Diable, Paris, Robert Laffont, collection \\" Bouquins \\". The Petit Albert occupies the pages 807‚Äì895. This means that everyone had one, even if everyone pretended to be indignant at the existence of these books. The profile of the reader was not that of the sorcerer, but that of a man of the world, who at the time was a farmer, and who was in general deeply Christian. This success is all the more remarkable because these books were of no use to the peasant. The formulas were not very practical. Even the cooking recipes (different compositions of spicy wine) require many expensive ingredients, difficult to identify and usually absent from French villages. The intended audience occupied the whole social spectrum. The hand of glory, for example, was an instrument appreciated by burglars. The soap recipes and the eau de toilette, which include many expensive ingredients from around the world, are probably those of the apothecaries of the ladies of the Court. \\"Copies of Le Petit Albert have been located among the 19th century French peasantry, the Hoodoo practitioners of New Orleans, and the Obeah men of the French West Indies.\\" The Petit Albert became a meme. \\"To say one had the Petit Albert was shorthand for saying one was deep in magic.\\" Petit Albert Contents of the book Depiction of a \\"hand of glory\\" from the Petit Albert * A warning to the reader * Sexual magic (ways to obtain romantic love, seduction, and even to make a woman dance naked) * Means to improve agricultural efficiency * Means to avoid various inconveniences (such as menaces who destroy crops or kill chickens) * Cooking recipes * Other recipes for daily life, such as \\"a soap for faces and hands alike\\" * Means for people and horses to move quickly and without fatigue * Making a \\"hand of glory\\" Other parts of the book represent the presentation of alchemical or cabalist theories whose origin is attributed mainly to Paracelsus. These include talismans in accordance with cabalist methods: how to make gold artificially, for example, and how to dissolve gold. Other how to's include how to turn lead into gold, how to create fake money using tin, how to use borax to melt gold, and how to create imitation pearls.

His debut album, The Mammoth Tusk, was released in 2009. The album was considered an international advancement for local Arabic hip-hop as it featured support from a number of high-profile acts including Damon Albarn (Gorillaz/Blur), De La Soul, The Rza / Gza / Cilvaringz (Wu-Tang Clan), Focus... (Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment), Rude Jude / Lord Sear (Shade 45), and 'Arap' band-mate Shadia Mansour. Career Jawaad's presence within the music industry is spread out across both the MENA region and Internationally. In addition to his solo career, Jawaad is a founding member of the Arab Hip-Hop Collective known as 'Arap', which consisted of - in addition to himself- Mohalim, Cilvaringz, Ledr P, and Shadia Mansour.

Salah Edin, who founded the group with Eslam and Cilvaringz, left the group in 2009, and the group itself ceased to record soon after. Though the band never released a studio album, the momentum they gave the Arab hip-hop movement through their tours and limited releases was one of the most anticipated and important developments for the genre. Jawaad's first international tour was with Wu-Tang Killa Beez, as he was brought into that fold by his longtime associate, partner and manager Cilvaringz. It was this that led to his collaboration with Rza and Gza on his album song 'So Real' ft. Shadia Mansour. His most recent endeavor with Wu-Tang is his Co-Executive Producer credits on the single-copy, art piece - Wu-Tang Clan album \\"Once Upon A Time in Shaolin\\", which made it into the Guinness Book of Records, as most valuable album. In addition to this, Jawaad also featured on Cilvaringz Album, \\"I\\". He has also toured with a number of other notable acts including Gorillaz, The Good The Bad and The Queen, Fun-da-mental, and Africa Express. He is an avid supporter of MENA region music and uses his influence to promote various artists from the region, while also managing acts including Mais Harb and Layali Project which he successfully signed onto Universal Music. Jawaad was instrumental in bringing long time friend and musical collaborator Damon Albarn to Syria to record with the Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music, and recordings from these sessions made it onto the Gorillaz album 'Plastic Beach', with the Orchestra alongside Albarn and Jawaad eventually touring under the Africa Express banner in 2016 across major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde.

It was one of the many instrumental airfields used to defeat Adolf Hitler's Axis powers in World War II. Located just north of Saint-Pierre-du-Mont along the English Channel coast, it was a United States Army Air Force temporary airfield established shortly after the D-Day landings in France. The airfield was one of the first established in the liberated area of Normandy, being constructed by the IX Engineering Command, 834th Engineer Aviation Battalion. History Known as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-1\\", the airfield consisted of a single Square-Mesh Track runway.

It was pressed into service as Emergency Landing Strip 1 (ELS A-1) with a untracked (grass/dirt) runway. It served only small observation aircraft at that time. Just over 24 hours later (18:45) it had been upgraded from a Refuelling and Rearming Strip (RRS A-1) to an Advanced Landing Ground (ALG A-1), able to handle aircraft up to the C-47 transport.

The nearest village of size is Carnock 0.8 miles (1.287 km) to the west, which has a church and primary school. To the south there is the Dean Woods past which is the village of Crossford, which has two hotels and businesses. Alternative names Gowkhall seems to have had at least two names in the past. In the William Roy Military Survey maps of Scotland 1747-55 the village does not appear to be marked. However in John Ainslie' mapping of Fife in 1775 it is, showing the large Clunie estate to immediate East of the village. In the later John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland 1832 it is clearly marked as Gowkhall, with the centre of the village being where the modern day junction between Clune Road and Dean Ridge occurs. However, by the Ordnance Survey map of 1898 the village is known as Balclune with no mention of Gowkhall, the name Gowkhall returns in the next (3rd) edition of the Ordnance Survey Maps 1903. Modern day The hamlet of Gowkhall comes under the authority of the Carnock and Gowkhall Community Council making use of the primary school in Carnock. No public amenities exist in Gowkhall itself. History Gowkhall historically is considered to have resided in the Lands of Clune, which in modern terms refers to the Wester Clune Farm. The Clune lands were originally in the barony of Pittencrieff and the parish of Dunfermline. The lands were latterly transferred into the parish of Carnock. References have been found back to 14 February 1441: ::\\"Instrument of Sasine in favour of David Hakat of lands of Clwno, lying in the barony of Pettyncref and sheriffdom of Fife, conform to his charter.\\" :: ('Pitfirrane Writs', 30) The name Clune is repeatedly associated, through various tales, with a Clunic Monk, or Knight Templar who used to reside in the area. One reference refers to unspecified sources telling that the Knight was known to wear \\"black frock, a pelisse, a hood of lamb's wool, red hose, a white woollen tunic, and black scapular - the latter sometimes white, and at other times red.\\". The fables tell of this clunic being \\"hospitable to strangers, fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and gave drink to those who were athirst, and performed his duty.\\". Certainly the name Clunie has persisted with the area and continues to this day, the lands now consider to be Wester Clune Farm used to reside in the Clunie Estate, shown in maps of 1776. Gowkhall officially broke with the Clune Estate on 22 October 1747 when Professor Erskine of Carnock acquired from James Henderson of Clune \\"the Room of land of the lands of Clune called Gowkhall\\" (G.R.S. 69) Gowkhall is reputed to have been a very attractive village in the early days and a one time native of the village is known to have been John Millar who is known to have spent the majority of his life teaching in London at a \\"Ragged School\\". Some lines of poetry are associated with him. > Oh worthy folk o' auld Gowkha' > Though neither great, nor grand, nor braw > Yet kindly folk were ye > And mony a face, I mind it still > While fancy sits upon your hill > And looks wi' mem'ry's e'e. > > John Millar (date unknown) > Gowkhall did at one time boast its own pub, called the Bamboo Inn currently known as Bamboo Cottage. This was closed down due to a \\"fatal incident\\" in the late 19th century resulting the licensee losing his license. The name Bamboo Inn is of unknown origin and a local bridge is also referred to as Bamboo Bridge. One source refers to the name \\"Bambow\\" in place of Bamboo, but no reference is provided to indicate if this was the original form. Gowkhall used to be famed for the number of wells that had been sunk in the village and in the early 19th century consisted mainly of hand weaving cottages. These cottages were demolished in the late 19th century and the stones used to build the impressive wall surrounding Luscar House, the Luskar Dyke. A curling pond was also located in Gowkhall, on the western edge. Reports suggest the access steps up to the road through the dyke still exist. The grounds of Luscar House built in 1838 by two of Scotland leading architects (David Bryce) of the time border the village. This house was in later years a residential care home. This category B listed building was largely destroyed by fire in 2001, following planning refusal to allow conversion into a hotel. In 2003 the house succumbed to demolition without planning consent. The stables being converted into modern living accommodation, legal proceedings followed resulting a controversially small fine (¬£300) being levied on the persons responsible.

History Antecedents In 1895, a group of Tulsans established a publication called The New Era, intended to convey a more positive image of the then-small town than that found in the existing paper, The Indian Republican. Supporters of Democratic Party leader William Jennings Bryan, they changed the name of The New Era to The Democrat in 1898. The paper was unprofitable and the publisher, R. L. Lunsford, sold it to Dave Jesse, who established the Tulsa Democrat as a daily in 1904, and sold it to William Stryker in 1905.Janet Pearson, \\"The End of a Great Story: Tulsa Tribune Helped Shape City's History\\", Tulsa World, August 2, 1992. Stryker sold the paper in 1916 (or 1915Gene Curtis, \\"Only in Oklahoma: Sand Springs founder helped others\\", Tulsa World, October 16, 2007.) to Charles Page, founder of the neighboring city of Sand Springs, who used the newspaper to promote his plan for the city of Tulsa to obtain its water from Shell Creek, near Sand Springs, rather than from Spavinaw in eastern Oklahoma.

The Tribune was also known for its opposition to Oklahoma Governor Jack C. Walton, who in 1923 declared martial law as part of his efforts to investigate the Ku Klux Klan. Walton later placed a censor at the Tribune offices after it ran an advertisement encouraging Klan members to resist his declaration.

He grew up in Northern California and has been based in Los Angeles since 1999 where he has performed, toured and recorded with several artists including CSS, Manic, Middle Class Rut, Jesse Spencer of the Fox show House, Fractional Importance, Stars Align, Art of Chaos, and Toadies guitarist Darrel Herbert. Nate is now employed by Live Nation Entertainment and is a production manager at The Wiltern in Los Angeles, CA. Career File Nate Perry began his professional music career at 19 as a production bassist on cruise ships while pursuing a B.A. in music from Humboldt State University & The University of Memphis, where he appeared with The Memphis Symphony. Shortly after relocating to Los Angeles, he joined Fractional Importance who released three records independently; including Visions, recorded by Don Kazarinoff (Incubus). Fractional gained regional popularity, opening for such bands as System of a Down, Alien Ant Farm, Smile Empty Soul and Seether, before eventually breaking up in 2004. In 2006, Perry briefly played in pop/rock band Stars Align(formerly Neve). Following a performance at The Troubadour, the band caught the interest of guitarist Joe Don Rooney of Rascal Flatts fame who went on to work with the group. They released a self-titled EP in 2009, produced by Rooney, which featured Perry on bass guitar. Dissatisfied with the band's Hot AC musical aspirations, Perry left Stars Align in 2007 to join experimental rock group Manic. The band released their debut EP, Floorboards on Geffen Records, which led to appearances at SXSW '07 as well as regional touring, including a residency at famed L.A. venue The Echo. Their second EP, Another New Home, featured writing by Perry; including the track Carolina Ghost which received airplay on the now defunct Indie 103.1. The song was later remixed by Joel Petersen of The Faint and released as a limited edition 7\\" vinyl on Suretone Records. Although the band's efforts received favorable press, drawing comparisons to Pink Floyd & Radiohead, they fell short of major label sales expectations and disbanded in late 2008. Nate performed with various L.A. based artists from 2008-2010 including former Toadies guitarist Darrel Herbert and Dwight Yoakam drummer, Mitch Marine. The trio recorded under the moniker DWH and later, No Tomorrow, self-releasing an EP in 2010. Perry also played locally with actor Jesse Spencer, known for his role on the hit show House, M.D., alongside singer Julian Sakata under the name The Ruby Fakes. In 2011 he received an M.M. from Cal State L.A. in Commercial Music where he taught as a graduate assistant. In the fall of 2011, Perry was recruited by Brazilian Sub Pop band CSS to be their touring bassist, following the departure of original member Adriano Cintra. Nate performed extensively with the band on tours of North America, Australia and Japan in support of their third studio album, La Liberaci√≥n. During this period, the band appeared at the 2011 Falls Festival in Australia alongside Fleet Foxes and Group Love, as well as at the Corona Capital Festival in Mexico City, with The Strokes and Moby. The group was especially well received in Japan, selling out famed Tokyo venue Studio Coast. Perry continued to tour with CSS throughout 2012, doing small tours and one-off performances throughout California and the Southwest.http://www.songkick.com/concerts/10546563-css-at-big- cathttp://www.songkick.com/concerts/10546568-css-at-studio-coast In 2012, Perry performed and recorded several bass tracks on the sophomore Middle Class Rut LP, Pick Up Your Head, released June 2013 on Bright Antenna Records.http://www.allmusic.com/album/pick-up-your-head-mw0002488140/credits Discography With Middle Class Rut * Pick Up Your Head (2013) With DWH * EP (2010) With Manic * A Strange Audience (2008) * Floorboards (2007) * Another New Home (2007) * Carolina Ghost - Broken Spindles 7-inch (2007) With Stars Align * Self Titled EP (2009) With Fractional Importance * Popstar Guitar - EA Games/PS3 Game (2008) * A Love Letter Suicide (2004) * Visions (2001) With Hermetic Science * A Hermetic Science Primer (2009) * Prophesies (1998) External links * Nate Perry Official Website * Nate Perry YouTube Channel * Nate Perry Twitter References Category:Guitarists from California Category:American rock bass guitarists Category:American male bass guitarists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Nate Perry"},{"id":"24382003","title":"Pelly (Saskatchewan electoral district)"},{"id":"24382008","text":"Saint-Arthur is an unincorporated community in Restigouche County, New Brunswick, Canada.New Brunswick Provincial Archives - Saint-Arthur History Notable people See also *List of communities in New Brunswick References Category:Communities in Restigouche County, New Brunswick ","title":"Saint-Arthur, New Brunswick"},{"id":"24382022","text":"Symphyotrichum depauperatum, also known as the serpentine aster, is a rare species of aster adapted to serpentine barrens, an ecosystem with a high concentration of toxic metals in the soil.

Lewry studied mathematical logic under Lejewski and A.N. Prior at Manchester (1961‚Äì2). From 1962‚Äì7 he taught the philosophy of language and logic at Hawkesyard. He was assigned to the Oxford Blackfriars in 1967. Dissatisfaction with teaching led him to work for an Oxford D.Phil. on the logic teaching of Robert Kilwardby. In 1979 he began the study of the history of grammar, logic and rhetoric at Oxford in the period 1220‚Äì1320. In 1979 he went to the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto first as a research associate, then as a senior fellow. He died on 23 April 1987 at the age of 57 at the Oxford Dominican House. Work Lewry wrote multiple works on Kilwardby's works, and argued that Kilwardby influenced Roger Bacon's thoughts. In particular, Kilwardby is argued to have influenced Bacon's theories on epistemology.Tachau 1988 pp. 12, 25 Also, Lewry specialized in identifying medieval sources and the attribution of authors for various manuscripts with a special focus on the works attributed to Kilwardby. In one instance, he provided evidence that the work Commenti super Priscianum Maiorem, previously attributed to Kilwardby, was not, in fact, written by the medieval thinker. Later critics have followed his lead and removed any attribution.Deely 2001 p. 439 Lewry was not limited to the works of Kilwardby; he also provided evidence regarding works attributed to Pseudo-Scotus.Read 1993 p. 236‚Äì237 Selected works * Theology of History, Mercier Press, 1969. * The Commentary on 'Priscianus Maior' Ascribed to Robert Kilwardby. \\"The Problem of the authorship\\" CIMAGL 1975 Vol 15 * Robert Kilwardby's Writings on the Logica vetus Studied with Regard to Their Teaching and Method.

They are often building new studios, centers support to fictional cities, a theater and an administrative building. In 2016, Projac rename as Est√∫dios Globo (Globo Studios).  History  The former Rede Globo studios, opened in 1965, were too small for the station's productions. In 1975, the Teatro F√™nix was inaugurated, for the production of auditorium programs. In 1980, it was found that the station's facilities would become improper in a short time. Projac (then called Jacarepagu√° Project) was designed to house the studios, administration, production, direction; and leave the Botanical Garden. The greatness of Projac, between conception and inauguration, constitutes an undertaking that took almost fifteen years to be completed. In the long interval between the departure of Globo from its former studios and the definitive entry into Projac, the broadcaster rented other spaces, such as Atl√¢ntida Cinematogr√°fica, Cyll Farney's Tycoon studios, part of Renato Arag√£o's studios, TV Tupi's studios at the old Cassino da Urca, P√≥lo Rio de Cinema e V√≠deo and the Herbert Richers studios, besides producing some programs at the Teatro F√™nix.

Lestz (March 29, 1914 ‚Äì September 15, 2009) was an American newspaper columnist, author, activist, philanthropist and publisher. Lestz is credited with leading the efforts to found the Demuth Museum at the childhood home of artist Charles Demuth on East King Street in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Biography Early life Lestz, the first child of immigrant parents, Jacob and Fannie Simon Lestz, was born on March 29, 1914, at their home at 511 South Shippen Street in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Lestz graduated from the now defunct Lancaster Boys High School in 1931. He earned his bachelor's degree in merchandising from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1935. His first job after college was at the upstart Lancaster Independent weekly newspaper. Lestz was hired to write the names of subscribers in circulation books for a starting salary of $15 per week. The now-defunct newspaper's editor, Willim N. Yonung, later promoted Lestz to a reporter. Gerry Lestz enlisted in the United States Army Air Force during World War II. He met his first wife, Edith Allport Lestz, during the war years. The couple moved to Lancaster following World War II and had two children. Edith Allport Lestz died in 1957. Lestz later married his second wife, Margaret Gordon Dana, an artist, who died in 2006. Career Lestz returned to his native Lancaster after World War II, where he began writing for the Lancaster New Era newspaper. Lestz would remain on staff at the Lancaster New Era for more than thirty years, focusing on feature articles, columns and editorials. On December 17, 1957, began writing The Scribbler column, a regular piece on Lancaster's history which had appeared in the Lancaster New Era since 1919 (with the exception of a period during World War II). Lestz continued to write The Scribbler twice a week, every week, until his retirement from the newspaper in 1979. Following Lestz's retirement, The Scribbler was taken over by Jack Brubaker, who continues to write the now weekly column as of 2011. Civic involvement Lestz also headed efforts to establish several cultural and civic institutions in Lancaster. For example, Lestz co-founded the Historic Preservation Trust of Lancaster County. Most notably, Lestz led the campaign to establish the Demuth Museum at the restored childhood home of Charles Demuth, Lancaster's most famous native artist. The museum was known as the Charles Demuth Foundation at the time of its establishment in 1981. Lestz served as the Demuth Foundation's president for museum's first three years. Under Lestz, the Demuth Foundation acquired the Charles Demuth home on East King Street, which became the museum. Lestz and the Foundation also purchased the property next door to the future Demuth Museum from Dorothea and Christopher Demuth. That second property houses the oldest continually operating tobacco shop in the United States. Both structures were converted into a museum by the Foundation which houses works by Charles Demuth as well as the tobacco shop. Carol Morgan, who became the director of the Charles Demuth Foundation in 1985, noted Lestz's contributions the museum and foundation after examining Lestz records, \\"I was absolutely stunned at the amount of personal work, planning and bureaucratic threading he went through to get that thing launched.\\" Lestz also helped to found the Heritage Center of Lancaster County, and served as the organizations president. He also served as the president of the Lancaster Summer Arts Festival, the Lancaster Public Library, Lancaster Community Concert Association, as well as the state president for the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen. Writings Lestz also published dozens of books and pamphlets on a variety of topics related to history, architecture, the Amish community, folklore and art. He published and edited the Baer's Almanac from 1948 until 2008. The Baer's Almanac is a Lancaster County publication founded in 1825. From 1986 to 2002, he was publisher of The Strasburg Weekly News, a small newspaper founded in 1898, and continued to contribute a weekly column to the paper until his death. Death Gerry Lestz died at his home on Conestoga Drive in Lancaster Township, Pennsylvania, on September 15, 2009, at the age of 95. He was survived by his son, Michael Elliot Lestz, daughter, Linda Lestz Weidman; stepson, Robert Gordon Dana; eight grandchildren and eight great- grandchildren.

Constructed in 1918, the span is one of only seven remaining covered bridges in Oregon that were built before 1920. Similar spans such as the Mill Creek Bridge crossed the Alsea or one of its tributaries in the same vicinity, but only the Hayden Bridge has survived. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Located along Hayden Road just south of Oregon Route 34, the bridge was either partly or completely rebuilt in 1945. Changes included larger and less rounded bridge portals that could accommodate larger vehicles. Narrow openings under the side-wall eaves on both sides of the span illuminated the interior. The bridge, repaired again in 2003, required further work in 2006 after a logging truck crashed into it. Of the more than 600 covered bridges once found in Oregon, only 50 remain. After 1915, although some were of queen-post or king- post design, most of the new covered bridges were of Howe-truss design. In that year, the Oregon legislature passed a law giving the Oregon State Highway Department oversight powers for bridges worth more than $500. The department developed plans for Howe-truss bridges, partly because they were relatively easy to assemble, and distributed them to the state's counties. Many of these bridges, often built with Douglas-fir timber available locally, were replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by bridges more suited to logging trucks and other big vehicles. Although most of the original bridges no longer exist, the remaining bridges have gained value as tourist attractions.

Background  Prior to Vanuatu's independence, the islands were known as the New Hebrides. The New Hebrides were governed by a condominium of France and the United Kingdom. In 1980, France and the United Kingdom agreed that Vanuatu would be granted independence on 30 July 1980. Beginning in June 1980, Jimmy Stevens, head of the Nagriamel movement, led an uprising against the colonial officials and the plans for independence. The uprising lasted about 12 weeks. The rebels blockaded Santo-Pekoa International Airport, destroyed two bridges, and declared the independence of Espiritu Santo island as the \\"State of Vemerana\\". Stevens was supported by French-speaking landowners and by the Phoenix Foundation, an American business foundation that supported the establishment of a libertarian tax haven in the New Hebrides.  Confrontation  On 8 June 1980, the New Hebrides government asked Britain and France to send troops to put down a rebellion on the island of Espiritu Santo. France and Britain sent troops but the French refused to allow them to take any effective action against the rebels. As independence day neared, the Prime Minister-elect, Walter Lini, asked Papua New Guinea if it would send troops to intervene. As Papua New Guinean soldiers began arriving in Espiritu Santo, the foreign press began referring to the ongoing events as the \\"Coconut War\\". However, the \\"war\\" was brief and unconventional. The residents of Espiritu Santo generally welcomed the Papua New Guineans as fellow Melanesians. Stevens's followers were armed with only bows and arrows, rocks, and slings. There were few casualties, and the war came to a sudden end: when a vehicle carrying Stevens's son burst through a Papua New Guinean roadblock in late August 1980, the soldiers opened fire on the vehicle, killing Stevens's son. Shortly thereafter, Jimmy Stevens surrendered, stating that he had never intended that anyone be harmed. At Stevens's trial, the support of the Phoenix Foundation to the Nagriamel movement was revealed. It was also revealed that the French government had secretly supported Stevens in his efforts. Stevens was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment; he remained in prison until 1991. Notes References *Richard Shears (1980).

A caucus revolt generally concludes with the party leader resigning their position as such a revolt is usually seen to show poor leadership skills. Often the mere appearance of a revolt in the caucus maybe enough to force a leader to step down. In Westminster style governments, if the party suffering from a caucus revolt is the current government, often an interim leader will be appointed by the party until a leadership convention can be held to elect a new leader, or a general election can be called should the party leader find a way to survive the revolt.  Examples  The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt against the premiership of William Aberhart in Alberta ultimately forced the premier to hand over considerable power to a committee of backbenchers, the Social Credit Board. The Board brought in British social credit \\"experts\\" who proposed radical legislation which led to a constitutional crisis when it was repeatedly blocked: first disallowed by the federal government, then reserved by Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, and ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada. After successfully leading the Liberal Party of Canada and being Prime Minister of Canada for over ten years, Jean Chr√©tien was forced to step down as both Party Leader and Prime Minister of Canada at the threat of a Caucus Revolt from his longtime Minister of Finance and political rival, Paul Martin Jr. Category:Political terminology in Canada Category:Political terms in the United Kingdom Category:Political terminology in Australia Category:Westminster system ","title":"Caucus revolt"},{"id":"24382659","text":"Bert and Ernie's Great Adventures (originally promoted as The Adventures of Bert and Ernie) is an animated series developed by Sesame Workshop in which Clay-animated versions of Bert and Ernie use their imaginations to travel to strange places and into entertaining situations.

She was the first designer to import polyester as a fashion textile to America. In her later life, Flagg became known for her re- occurring role on the Bravo television program Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles with her grandson Josh Flagg. Early life Edith Flagg was born Edith Faierstein to a Jewish family on November 1, 1919 in Vienna, Austria.Birth certificate for Edith Faierstein She was raised in Gala»õi, Romania, where her father worked as a photographer. At the age of 15 she returned to Vienna to study fashion and lived in Austria through her teenage years. When Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, she fled to the Netherlands with her boyfriend Hans Stein. She married Hans Stein after they moved to the Netherlands in 1938. Instead of leaving the Netherlands after the German invasion, Flagg took the identity of the deceased Lydia Voskuilen. When she became pregnant with her son Michael, she hid the child in a sanitarium and posed as a nurse in order to visit him. Hans Stein was captured by Germans and sent to Auschwitz where he died in 1944. After Stein's death, Flagg worked within the Dutch underground resistance where she met her second husband Erich Simon Flegenheimer (later known as Eric Flagg), and after the war they married.Marriage certificate for Edith Faierstein and Erich Simon Flegenheimer; 28 May 1947http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?pid=172114334 Together they were responsible for saving several lives. She acted as a spy, swimming with Nazi soldiers and relaying what she overheard. Flagg reportedly killed two Nazis. Eric then moved to the United States and Edith and Michael lived on a kibbutz in Palestine, what would soon become Israel. Edith and Michael followed Eric to the United States and while Eric worked in New York, Edith and Michael moved to San Francisco and lived with Hans' parents. Edith, Eric and Michael then moved to Los Angeles in 1949. Career Flagg started her career after arriving in New York in 1948 as a seamstress, progressing to design, then later in Los Angeles, California working in the Garment District. She began her first line of dresses in 1956 with a $2,000 investment of her own savings. Her clothing-line \\"Edith Flagg, Inc.\\" (1956‚Äì2000) manufactured in the United States from the 1950s until her retirement from the fashion industry in 2000. The brand was characterized by its wrinkle-resistant knitwear. As of 2012, the company reportedly afforded her a net worth of $100 million. Flagg was the first person to import polyester to the United States and popularize it. She discovered a type of polyester called Crimplene which was being produced by Imperial Chemical Industries out of Leeds, England. The material was used for parachutes and military uniforms during World War II, resulting in a post-war surplus. Flagg found the new fabric while vacationing in Switzerland in the 1960s. She signed an exclusive advertising contract with DuPont to import Crimplene from England and popularize under the name polyester. She also imported the synthetic fabric Dacron. Edith Flagg, Inc. expanded from a successful dress manufacturing company in Los Angeles to an international design house with offices and showrooms in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Cleveland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Charlotte and London, as well as a factory in Hong Kong. She was an active contributor to California Apparel News and Women's Wear Daily in a weekly column titled \\"By the Way.\\" Later, she often appeared on the television show Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles to offer business advice to her grandson, Josh Flagg. When Josh was fourteen, he wrote A Simple Girl: Stories My Grandmother Told Me, a book about her survival during World War II and her career. The book was published in 2009, prior to the show. Philanthropy She was a donor to the United Jewish Welfare Fund, a Jewish non-profit organization, and the City of Hope, a private hospital in California.Victoria Talbot, 'Edith Flagg, Fashion Pioneer and Philanthropist, Dead at 94', The Beverly Hills Courier, August 22, 2014, Volume XXXXVIIII, Number 34, pp. 4;18 Flagg retired in 2000 to concentrate on her philanthropy, focusing on Jewish and medical causes. She was a donor to the United Jewish Welfare Fund, a Jewish non-profit organization, and the City of Hope, a private hospital in California of which she and her husband were also board members. Proceeds from her biography A Simple Girl: Stories My Grandmother Told Me were donated to the Jewish Federation. Flagg and her husband were the recipients of multiple awards from the National Conference of Christians and Jews and The United Jewish Welfare Fund. Personal life Flagg spoke Yiddish, Hebrew, Romanian, English, French, German and Dutch. She resided in a penthouse in The Century Towers on the Avenue of the Stars, Century City in Los Angeles, which she and her husband purchased from Jack Benny in 1976 for the highest price recorded for a condominium in Los Angeles up to that date.Erin Weinger, Edith Flagg, 'Million Dollar Listing' Grandma, Dies at 94, The Hollywood Reporter, August 13, 2014 Death She died on August 13, 2014 in her penthouse in Century City of natural causes.http://www.allaboutthetea.com/2014/08/13/sad-news-josh-flagg-says- farewell-to-grandmother-edith/ She was ninety-four years old.

The song peaked at #6 on Canada's Rock chart, and is still one the band's most popular songs. Music video The music video for \\"Strange Days\\" depicts a young homeless girl begging for change outside an office building, and being turned down by a woman passerby. Interspersed are \\"strange\\" happenings (such as the street turning to dusk) and a flashback sequence showing the girl running away from an abusive father. Throughout, a disheveled and unshaven Matthew Good is depicted interacting with the video's characters, though his presence goes unnoticed. At the climax of the song the woman leaves the building, once again dismissing the girl's and a still unnoticed Good's request for change. The young runaway watches as the woman steps off the curb into the path of an oncoming van. The runaway springs up to save the woman, sacrificing herself in the process. Fading in, the girl's ghost is shown watching paramedics as they close a body bag over her. She finally acknowledges Good, who is now clean shaven and wearing an all black suit, revealing his role as an angel. The final blurred shot depicts a little girl skipping down a tunnel toward a bright light and Good follows.
