A new building was planned on the east side of Nostrand Avenue between from Halsey and Macon Streets, designed by Superintendent of Buildings James W.

The journal that he founded, Alma Portuguesa, was an early basis for integralist development and he produced it in exile until he was amnestied in 1916. Whilst in exile Almeida Braga was also involved in translating Portuguese language literature into French, including some of the works of Gil Vicente.Four Plays of Gil Vicente, p. 73 Integralism He was involved in the failed monarchist uprising of 1919 and afterwards became, along with his close ally Alberto Monsaraz, one of the leading advocates for the claims of Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 8 Although a prolific writer he was not a main leader of the integralist movement and spent much of the 1920s out of Portugal, notably in Brazil. Whilst there his writings found an audience and helped to bring about the development of Brazilian Integralism. As one of the group's leading thinkers he set out to convert Portugal's elite to the new, somewhat Maurrasian, political ideology, particularly focusing on the young in their quest for support.Tom Gallagher, Portugal: A Twentieth-Century Interpretation, Manchester University Press, 1983, pp. 30-31 Under Salazar In 1932, by then settled back in Portugal, he joined with Jos√© Hip√≥lito Raposo in launching the journal Integralismo Lusitano as an attempt to redefine their older ideas in the Portugal of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar. The initiative was not a success.

The hotel is a Chicago landmark that overlooks Grant Park, Lake Michigan, and the Museum Campus. It is the third-largest hotel in Chicago by number of guest rooms; however, it has the largest total meeting and event space of any Chicago hotel. Every sitting president of the United States has been housed in the hotel before leaving office since its opening in 1927.Welcome to the Hilton Chicago, by Janice R. Kiaski, November 16, 2008. History The Stevens Hotel The hotel, designed in the Beaux-Arts architecture style, opened on May 2, 1927, as the Stevens Hotel, across Balbo Street from the older Blackstone Hotel. At the time, the Stevens was the largest hotel in the world. The hotel was developed by James W. Stevens, his son Ernest, and their family who ran the Illinois Life Insurance Company and owned the Hotel La Salle; James and Ernest Stevens are the grandfather and father, respectively, of former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. The Stevens featured 3,000 guest rooms, cost approximately $30 million to construct (more than ten times the cost of Yankee Stadium only few years earlier), and boasted of a virtual \\"City Within a City\\". The Stevens housed its own bowling alley, barber shop, rooftop miniature golf course (the \\"High-Ho Club\\"), movie theater, ice cream shop, and drug store. The first registered guest was Vice President Charles G. Dawes. The Great Depression ruined the Stevens family, and the State of Illinois charged the hotel's owners with financial corruption. Like four out of five American hotels during the Great Depression, the Stevens Hotel went bankrupt. The government took the hotel into receivership, and by the late 1930s, it was valued at only $7 million. In 1942, the U.S. Army purchased the Stevens Hotel for $6 million for use as barracks and classrooms for the Army Air Force during World War II. The Stevens housed over 10,000 air cadets during this time, who utilized the Grand Ballroom as their mess hall. In January 1944, the War Department closed a deal to sell the property for $4.91 million to a bricklayer turned private businessman named Stephen Healy. On 7 December 1944, delegates from 54 nations gathered in the Grand Ballroom of the Stevens Hotel to conclude and sign the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known more popularly as the ‚ÄòChicago Convention‚Äô, the defining international agreement which has since permitted the global civil aviation system to develop peacefully and in a manner benefiting all peoples and nations of the world. The Conrad Hilton As World War II drew to a close, Conrad Hilton purchased the hotel from Healy in February 1945. The board of directors changed the name of the hotel, naming it after Conrad Hilton himself on November 19, 1951. Conrad continued to use his Hollywood connections to entice film stars, politicians and royalty to the hotel. Among improvements made to the hotel was the installation of a large ice stage in the Boulevard Room Supper Club which began featuring elaborate ice shows in 1948. In January 1958, Darlene and Jinx the skating chimpanzee performed. The Hilton Center was added to the building in 1962, featuring a three-level structure containing expanded exhibit space, the Continental Ballroom and the International Ballroom.Chicago's Grand Hotels, Robert V. Allegrini, 2005, page 109. In April 1951, crowds gathered in the Great Hall to hear a speech by General Douglas MacArthur defending his conduct of the war in Korea, calling for a new American policy toward the conflict to replace the current \\"political vacuum\\". Chicago Police outside the Conrad Hilton during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. During the 1968 Democratic National Convention, the streets outside the Conrad Hilton Hotel were the scene of a police riot as antiwar demonstrators, being beaten and arrested, began to chant \\"The whole world is watching\\". Some protesters escaped into the hotel, along with tear gas and \\"stink bombs\\", and the hotel suffered minor damage as a result of the violence as a couple of street level windows gave way under the weight of dozens of protesters being pushed up against them by the police. Chicago Hilton and Towers The Conrad Hilton hotel was aging and in the 1970s, its demolition was considered. However, in 1984, the hotel closed for over a year for what was then the most expensive hotel renovation ever undertaken, at $185 million. The hotel's 3,000 guest rooms were rebuilt into 1,544 larger and more elegant rooms; 600 were converted to double-sized rooms with two adjoining bathrooms. The reborn hotel glittered and helped to sustain a revival period in Chicago's South Loop neighborhood. The newly renamed Chicago Hilton and Towers reopened on October 1, 1985. Hilton Chicago In 1998, under a new initiative by Hilton Hotels Corporation, the Hilton name was placed first in branding, and the Chicago Hilton and Towers became simply \\"Hilton Chicago\\". Under general manager John G. Wells, the hotel continues its track record of having hosted every U.S. president since it opened in 1927. In 2012 the hotel started re- invention with $150 million renovation, including new dining outlets 720 South Bar & Grill, SNAX and Kitty O'Sheas. The Conrad Hilton Suite The Hilton Chicago is home to Chicago's largest and most expensive hotel room, which formerly served as the Tower Ballroom. The Conrad Hilton Suite is a suite that encompasses two floors, T3 and T4. The suite costs more than $7,000 per night. Refurbished in 2013, the suite includes 16-foot lake view windows, a baby grand piano, a billiard table, three balconies, three bedrooms on the lower level - each with multiple flat screen televisions, and a helipad.

The 9th is associated with Lockheed U-2 and Distributed Common Ground System operations. The squadron was first active during World War II as the 9th Photographic Technical Unit, serving in the European Theater of Operations. The 9th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron was active from 1948 through 1950 and again from 1966 through 1991, primarily as the photographic interpretation unit of the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. It was consolidated with the 9th Photographic Technical Unit in 1985 and the 9th Intelligence Squadron in 2009. Mission The 9th operates and maintains the $15M Deployable Shelterized System-Film, the Department of Defense's only mobile film processing capability, as part of the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System architecture. The unit also processes, exploits, and disseminates broad area, high-resolution imagery collected by the Lockheed U-2 to meet combatant commander requirements. History World War II The squadron was first organized in France during the fall of 1944 as the 9th Photographic Laboratory Section. The section would provide processing of reconnaissance photography for XXIX Tactical Air Command (Provisional). It continued this mission through V-E Day. It briefly acted as part of the army of occupation, returning to the United States in November 1945, where it was inactivated at the Port of Embarkation. Strategic reconnaissance support The second predecessor of the squadron was activated in July 1948 as the 12th Photographic Technical Squadron at Topeka Air Force Base, Kansas, where it was assigned to the 311th Air Division, which was the primary reconnaissance headquarters for Strategic Air Command (SAC). In 1949, SAC reorganized its reconnaissance assets, assigning the squadron to the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and moving it to Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base, California as the 9th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron. On 1 April 1950, however, the 9th Wing mission changed from long-range reconnaissance to strategic bombardment. Ten days later, the 9th Squadron moved to Rapid City Air Force Base, South Dakota, where it was assigned to the 28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. It was inactivated at the end of the month, with its assets forming the cadre for the 28th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron. The squadron was again organized in late June 1966, at Beale Air Force Base, California, where it absorbed the mission, personnel and equipment of the 4203d Reconnaissance Technical Squadron, which was discontinued the same day.Mueller, p. 27 The squadron processed reconnaissance products produced by the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing's Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird and, later, Lockheed U-2 Dragon Ladys until inactivating in July 1991. Intelligence The 9th Intelligence Support Squadron was activated at Beale in September 1991, the same day its predecessor was inactivated, assuming much of its mission, equipment and personnel. The squadron dropped \\"support\\" from its name in 2003, and in July 2009, the two squadrons were consolidated.

The company has expanded through organic growth and acquisitions to approximately 400 service locations in North America including over 50 hazardous waste management facilities in 38 U.S. states, seven Canadian provinces, Mexico and Puerto Rico.Yahoo Finance The company is included in the S&P; 400 mid-cap index and the S&P; 1500 composite index.Yahoo Finance  History  Clean Harbors, Inc. was founded in 1980 in Brockton, Massachusetts,Reference for Business: Company History Index, Clean Harbors ‚Äì Company Profile http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/11/Clean-Harbors- Inc.htmlClean Harbors History http://www.cleanharbors.com/about_us/history.html a Boston suburb, by Alan S. McKim, who continues as the company's CEO and Chairman. The company had one truck and four employees who transported and disposed of hazardous wastes for local businesses. It soon began adding larger corporate accounts and grew to 18 employees and $1.5 million in revenues by the end of its second year. In year three its revenue increased to $4.2 million and 34 employees. Clean Harbors expanded to offer emergency hazardous waste cleaning services and industrial waste disposal, as well as ongoing management of hazardous material sites. Revenues continued to climb approaching $50 million in 1986. Expansion and diversification Clean Harbors held its initial public offering (IPO) offering of one million shares at $9 a share on the NASDAQ on November 24, 1987. Six months later Clean Harbors' stock had risen from $9 to more than $15. The company made a secondary offering at the higher share price. After the two tranches Alan McKim retained about 60 percent ownership of Clean Harbors. Going public set the stage for expansion. Clean Harbors, still solely an environmental services company, purchased Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) certified hazardous waste incinerators in Arkansas, Nebraska, Ontario, Quebec, Texas and Utah, which it continues to own and operate to this day. During this time Clean Harbors also developed its emergency response capabilities. Its first project came in 1984 when it removed oil from a tanker, which foundered off Cape Cod in a snowstorm. It participated in several cleanup projects in New England and expanded to respond to emergencies outside of the region as well as handling industrial and land-based cleanup and transportation projects. During this time the company also greatly expanded its services for the industrial and chemical industry sectors. These services focused on collecting, packing and disposing of industrial and research laboratory and production chemicals, many of which were disposed of through Clean Harbors' expanding network of RCRA-certified landfills and incinerators. In 1998, Clean Harbors Industrial Services was established as division to handle in-plant cleaning and maintenance services, including chemical cleaning, vacuuming, steam cleaning and hydroblasting of chemical processing equipment. Over the years Clean Harbors has continued to expand through organic growth and approximately 35 acquisitions. Most of the acquisitions were relatively small compared to Clean Harbors‚Äô overall revenues. Major acquisitions, such as Eveready, Inc., Peak Energy Services, Teris LLC and most notably, Safety-Kleen Systems, their best acquisition to date, have substantially added to the company's assets and broadened its service lines to include industrial and energy services, solvent recovery/recycling, lodging and oilfield and environmental dewatering technologies. Today, Clean Harbors has a substantial presence in oil and gas oilfields and refinery operations and used oil recycling and re-refining while maintaining and growing its environmental and industrial services business lines. Acquisitions timetable Over the years Clean Harbors has completed the purchase of more than 35 companies or substantial divisions of companies. Early investments from Clean Harbors‚Äô founding until 2009 were primarily in the environmental services, waste management and industrial services areas. It made its first major acquisition in the oil and gas area in 2009 and has since further expanded in that sector through organic growth and acquisitions.

That can encourage them to retreat, surrender, or defect rather than defeating them in combat. Demoralization methods are military tactics such as hit-and-run attacks such as snipers, disturbing the enemy with less-lethal weapons and incapacitating agents, and intimidation such as display of force concentration. Some methods on the strategic scale are commerce raiding, strategic bombing, static operations such as sieges and naval blockades, and propaganda. Importance of morale Morale is often perceived as a necessary precursor to success in international relations. Success most often goes to those who believe in their cause, as they more easily maintain a positive outlook that helps them work harder for it.Angelo Codevilla and Paul Seabury, War: Ends and Means (Washington, D.C.: Potomac Books, 2006). High morale can directly contribute to \\"an economy of food, textiles, fuel, and other commodities, and to stimulate recruiting, employment in war industries, service in relief work, and the purchase of bonds\\".Harold D. Lasswell, Propaganda Technique in World War I (Cambridge, MA: M.I.T. Press, 1971). Writing in 1965, French philosopher and sociologist Jacques Ellul described the importance of morale in modern society by saying: Though variations are possible, the most common indicators of high morale are determination, enthusiasm, self-confidence, and a relative absence of criticism or complaint. While contributors to the level of morale are essentially endless, common examples consist of the level to which individuals identify with a nation or cause; have their basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter met; have confidence in the justness of their cause; have confidence in the ability of their cause to overcome obstacles; the means through which authorities instill discipline; and a sense of unity with other supporters of the cause. Psychological warfare American Revolutionary War leaflet attempting to demoralize the enemy by showing distinctions in the quality of life between the fighting forces. In an environment in which two belligerents compete, the chances of success greatly diminish if those whose actions are necessary lack faith in the justness of the cause or its chance for success or are discouraged, morally defeated, disconsolate, antagonistic, sullen, inattentive, or lazy. Demoralization can be used to lessen the chances of success for an opponent by fostering these attitudes, and it can generally be done in one of two ways: demoralization through objective conditions or demoralization through perception. Demoralization through objective conditions most commonly takes the form of a military defeat on the battlefield that has tangible consequences directly resulting in the indicators of a demoralized party, but it can also result from an adverse physical environment where basic needs go unmet. Demoralization through perception, however, is the most commonly referred to means of demoralization even though its operation and results like political warfare and psychological warfare in general, are the most difficult to gauge.Murray Dyer, The Weapon on the Wall: Rethinking Psychological Warfare (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1959), pg. 7. That is the form of demoralization that is referred to as a tool of psychological warfare, and it is most commonly implemented through various forms of propaganda. Propaganda as a tool of demoralization refers to influencing opinion through significant symbols, through means such as rumors, stories, pictures, reports, and other means of social communication. Other means of political and psychological warfare, such as deception, disinformation, agents of influence, or forgeries, may also be used to destroy morale through psychological means so that belligerents start questioning the validity of their beliefs and actions. Means used While demoralization may use propaganda, deception, disinformation, agents of influence, forgeries, or any other political warfare tool in isolation to accomplish its ends, a strategic demoralization effort will use more than one of these means as determined by its target and will not limit itself to the strict limits of attacking another belligerent's morale. A strategic demoralization campaign will navigate what Harold D. Lasswell describes as roughly three avenues of implementation: divert the hatred normally directed towards the enemy, thereby denying a unified outlet of frustration; sow seeds of self-doubt (classic demoralization); and provide a new focus of hatred and frustration. A strategic demoralization campaign should tailor its strategy to the specific target and situation. Denial of an enemy image An important precursor to successful demoralization is an effort to deny the target the ability to project frustrations and hatred upon a common enemy. Such efforts will affect the tendency of the target's citizenry to project their discontent towards a common enemy identified by their government. As a result, frustrations will build until it is necessary to divert them elsewhere, and seeds of doubt are then sown in the minds of the citizenry who now question the capability of their leadership in identifying the most ominous threat. The operations of the German Gazette des Ardennes, published in occupied areas of France during World War I, are an example of this aspect of strategic demoralization. The Gazette des Ardennes regularly published propaganda articles that sought to deny the French of a German enemy image. Articles would carry such themes as: the Kaiser has always been known and respected for promoting peace, even among the British and French intellectual elite; the Kaiser is a kind and gentle family man; \\"all the stories about the German barbarities are poisonous lies\\"; German occupying soldiers are kind to and loved by French children; and Germans have an irrepressible love of music, religion, and morality that permeates wherever they are. The themes are illustrative of \\"defense by denial\\". Also possible to use is \\"defense by admission accompanied by justification\\". The technique would make the Gazette des Ardennes admit that a German atrocity occurred but then publish accounts that the event was exaggerated in earlier reports, that such events occurred in every army, and occurred least often in the German army. Articles that attempted to justify German unrestricted submarine warfare as an unavoidable consequence of the British blockade are also examples of defense by admission and justification. Sowing seeds of doubt and anxiety Causing self-doubt or doubt in a cause is the simple definition most commonly ascribed to demoralization. It is only one aspect of a successful strategic demoralization campaign but is the most pronounced and essential part. As noted by Lasswell, \\"the keynote in the preliminary spade work is the unceasing refrain: Your cause is hopeless. Your blood is spilt in vain.\\" Propaganda can be an indispensable tool in fostering an environment of doubt and anxiety. Propaganda may be used to ensure the antagonist is the most feared party, give a feeling of nonworth to the target, exploit internal fissures inherent within the target group or use the element of surprise to show a target population that their leadership and cause are unable to protect them from the impending enemy threat. Many studies have been conducted that indicate fear is one of the most widespread psychological traits, and that trait can be manipulated for the purposes of demoralization if it can be expanded into anxiety.Jacques Ellul, Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes (New York, NY: Vintage Books, 1973). For anxiety to demoralize, it must result in a distancing of individuals or groups from their cause or leadership because they no longer believe them capable of offering a solution to the source of their anxiety. Real and conscious threats that normally inspire disquiet and fear can be made to cause anxiety and borderline neurosis through the use of such propaganda tools as fables and rumors. Using multiple tools of political warfare, such as deception, disinformation, agents of influence, or forgeries, can expedite the onset of anxiety by overwhelming the target with a constant onslaught of information that the current cause or leadership is incapable of relieving the anxiety now felt. That anxiety cannot be calmed through a rational explanation of facts and is exacerbated by such an approach. The newly-onset anxiety places mass groups of individuals on the border of neurosis and can make them feel conflicts inherent within society or their past. As a result of contradictions and threats, \\"man feels accused, guilty\\". The target will then begin their search for a cause that will provide a sense of righteousness. The pivotal moment of a successful demoralization campaign is when the target is doubt-ridden and anxious, the point at which individual members of a citizenry or group are detached from their current loyalty to their state or cause, and they are then able to be focused in another direction more suitable to the antagonist's needs. If not done properly, the manufactured sense of anxiety can both backfire on antagonists and cause the subject to cling more closely to their original cause or government. Diverting frustrations and hatred to a new target The most powerful strategy of demoralization is diversion, but that is an extremely difficult and multifaceted operation. Lasswell notes, \\"To undermine the active hatred of the enemy for its present antagonist, his anger must be distracted to a new and independent object, beside which his present antagonist ceases to matter.\\" Because it is such a distinct change, the diversion of hatred towards a new target is necessarily predicated upon the antagonist both diverting hatred away from themselves and fostering a level of anxiety that cannot be mitigated by their existing cause or leadership. Once antagonists met the two precursors of demoralization, it is possible to \\"concentrate upon the particular object of animosity about which it is hoped to polarize the sentiment of the enemy\\". The diversion of hatred can be towards an ally, towards the enemy's government or governing class, or towards antistate sentiment to foster secession of minority nationalities if they exist. The attempt to exacerbate relations between allies is one method of diverting hatred from an enemy and was attempted by both the Allied and Central Powers in World War I. The Germans made efforts to dig up historical animosity between the French and British, using such themes as the British were just letting the French bleed for them and the British intended to stay on French soil, and they offered a German-French alliance against the British and to expand French colonial domain at the expense of the British Empire. Meanwhile, the Allies tried to exacerbate the relationship between Austria-Hungary and Germany, using such themes as separate peace talks were being held with Austria-Hungary, Austria-Hungary had a plethora of food while Germans starved, Germans thought of Austrians as slaves, and the familiar promise of territorial expansion if Austria-Hungary abandoned their German alliance. The antagonist can also attempt to divert hatred and frustration upon the target's government or ruling class, the most widely attempted method. One technique of diverting such frustration is to convince a target that their government or leadership is committing unjust and immoral acts, which is especially effective if the antagonist can convince their target that their leadership has forced them to commit equally unjust and immoral acts out of trickery or desperation. If successfully and fully implemented, the leadership of a cause can be made sufficiently troublesome to inspire revolution when there will be insufficient capacity to exercise active hatred towards the external enemy. Diverting frustration to one's own leadership is often the method most commonly seen in wartime propaganda, as the photographs below attest. With the implementation of modern warfare in World War I and all its associated stresses, \\"every belligerent took a hand in the perilous business of fomenting dissension and revolution abroad, reckless of the possible repercussions of a successful revolt\\". Examples from World War I included German forces providing revolutionary literature to Russian prisoners of war that were expected to return through exchange or release, French use of propaganda leaflets to demonstrate how unaffected by war the Kaiser and his family were, technical encouragement and amplification of national dissent, Wilsonian propaganda stressing peaceful settlement terms, British planting of stories attesting to underground German resistance movements and their subsequent oppression by the German government, propaganda deflecting war guilt, propaganda exposing or exaggerating the desired postwar peace terms, and the promotion of the belief that infidelity was rampant among soldiers and their families back home. Finally, the antagonist can attempt to divert frustration towards the growth of secessionist causes, which is possible in heterogeneous nations. Attempts are made to fan the flames of discontent one segment of the nation feels towards another. An example was the Congress of Oppressed Habsburg Nationalities in Rome in April 1918, all delegates signing a Declaration of Independence. Or actions were widely reported in US and European circles. Another successful example of this was the encouragement of Zionism as a means of securing Jewish support for World War I via the Balfour Declaration. The Central Powers likewise tried to encourage Ukrainian, Irish, Egyptian, North African, and Indian secessionist movements, but all efforts ultimately failed. Tactics There are many tactics of pursuing a strategy of demoralization, the nature of the target and the environment at the time determining the best method to employ. Below is a nonexhaustive list to demonstrate tactics of pursuing demoralization, but any tactic of political and psychological warfare may be used in pursuit of demoralization as appropriate, to the situation: * Insertions into neutral press * Direct transmission (through publications or radio) * Books and pamphlets (such as J‚Äôaccuse) * Forgeries, whether forged letters from home inspiring homesickness or forged government documents * Tactical delivery systems (airplane or balloon drops, \\"trench mortars\\") * Smuggling (use of printed propaganda for packing materials, camouflaging propaganda to appear as currency so it may be carried about freely) * Deception * Disinformation * Agents of influence Defense  : Every message that resistance shall end, is false. - If the war comes, a Swedish information folder first issued in 1943 Morale can be difficult to maintain, in large part by the diffuse nature of demoralization attacks, but a strong leadership can largely mitigate any such attacks against their group's morale. Morale will quickly deteriorate if members of the group perceive themselves as victims of injustice or indifference on part of their leadership, or they perceive their leadership as being acting ineptly, ignorantly, or for personal ambition. As noted by Angello Codevilla, the clearest indicators that morale can withstand a demoralization campaign are also hallmarks of a well-led organization, and can be explained through five main questions: * Do the constituent parts of the group fear their own leadership more than the enemy? That can be either an authoritarian type of fear or a more democratic type of fear in which the members of a group fear contributing to the failure of their cause. * Do the constituent parts of the group feel appreciated by their leadership? No human will work to their full potential if they do not feel appreciated, but those who feel appreciated will contribute remarkable amounts, including sacrifice of life. * Do the constituent parts of the group feel their contributions are important, and others depend on their continued effort towards the cause? That is dependent on leadership engendering a hope of success if all members does their part, but excess attempts to inspire can invite cynicism. * Do the constituent parts of the group have habits of loyalty and camaraderie? If so, high morale can be maintained in the most difficult circumstances out of a desire to avoid disappointing or endangering others. * Do the constituent parts of the group have faith in their leaders and the chances of success? As Codevilla notes, \\"If the two disappear, soldiers tend to believe they have been sold out and throw away their weapons.\\" Credibility is the bedrock of defense against demoralization, but unwelcome surprise is the greatest threat to morale.

Weeks in 1888. At its peak in the late 1970s, Hornblower ranked eighth among member firms of the New York Stock Exchange in number of retail offices, with 93 retail sales offices located in the United States and Europe. Hornblower was active in financing automobile companies in the first half of the 20th century, including Dodge Motors, General Motors, and Hudson Motor Car Company.Milestones. TIME, Mar. 28, 1938 The firm, which by the 1970s was known as Hornblower & Weeks, Hemphill, Noyes and later, Hornblower, Weeks, Noyes & Trask, was acquired by Loeb, Rhoades & Co. to form Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. History Henry Hornblower c.1908 Founding and early history Hornblower & Weeks was organized on August 7, 1888. Henry Hornblower and John W. Weeks undertook the continuation of the business of Hornblower & Page, which had been founded and managed by Hornblower's father, Edward Thomas Hornblower. Henry Hornblower joined his father's firm in 1879 at age 16, serving as a clerk. Henry Hornblower, who was born June 6, 1863 in Lawrence, Massachusetts came from a distinguished family in Boston. \\"The name of 'Hornblower' is one of the features of Boston and the old Bay State. It is a name that has flourished through generations...The line of Hornblowers in Boston and New England has been an honorable one as far back as family prestige can be traced.\\"Copper Curb & Mining Outlook Vol. 9, #1, September 27, 1911, p.14-15 Following the death of Mr. Augustus A. Page in the spring of 1888, Edward Hornblower, blind by this time, announced his retirement and his intention to dissolve the firm. The younger Hornblower joined together with John Weeks to begin the new firm where the old one had left off. The firm's original office was located at 51 State Street with one clerk, James J. Phelan, who would ultimately serve as a partner of the firm until his death in 1934.Bankers magazine, Volume 77. 1908, p.441-448 In 1889, they bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for $19,000 and moved to the Merchant‚Äôs Bank Building on Devonshire Street. Surviving the Panic of 1893, which resulted in numerous failures of industrial corporations and financial houses, the young firm moved into larger quarters on the second floor of the Exchange Building at 53 State Street. 1900-1950 By 1900, the firm had a net worth of $400,000, by 1902, $800,000, and in 1903 and 1904, founding partner John W. Weeks, consolidated the First National Bank of Boston with the National Bank of Redemption, creating the largest bank in New England. In 1907, offices were opened in Providence and Chicago, and a Bond department was established. That same year, the firm became one of the first on Wall Street to set up a Statistical and Research Department. John W. Weeks c.1908 In 1913, Ralph Hornblower, son of the founder, Henry Hornblower, was admitted to the partnership, and John W. Weeks retired upon his election to the U.S. Senate. Weeks was involved in the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1914 and would go on to be U.S. Secretary of War in the 1920s. After the crash of 1929, which the firm survived with small capital losses except in the syndicate department, the firm went through a period of retrenchment. By 1930, firm capital had grown to over $16 million, but would be substantially reduced during the ensuing years of the depression. During the 1930s Hornblower made a number of acquisitions including a merger with G.M.-P. Murphy & Co., best known for its financing of major aviation companies, including Pan American Airways, United Air Lines, Boeing, and Lockheed. In 1950, Henry Hornblower,II and Ralph Hornblower, Jr., were admitted as partners to the firm. Expansion and consolidation from 1950-1977 In 1953, Hornblower & Weeks merged with the firm Paul H. Davis & Co. of Chicago, which had functioned as a correspondent of the New York Hornblower office. Later that year the acquisition of the cotton brokerage business of Scatterty & Jones led to new Hornblower offices in the Southern U.S. The mergers brought the firm‚Äôs total to 19 offices nationwide. Reed & Company of Worcester, Massachusetts was acquired in 1955. In the 1960s the firm opened new offices around the country with thirty offices operating from coast to coast, and memberships were held in all the major American exchanges by 1963. The firm merged with Hemphill, Noyes & Co. in 1963, changing its name to Hornblower & Weeks, Hemphill, Noyes. Hemphill, Noyes & Co. had been founded in 1919 by Jansen Noyes and Clifford Hemphill, among others.Business digest and investment weekly. January 7, 1919 Jansen Noyes, Jr. was named chairman of Hornblower, Weeks, Hemphill, Noyes & Co. in 1968. Hornblower next acquired Spencer Trask & Co., changing the name once again to Hornblower, Weeks, Noyes & Trask. At this point in time, Hornblower ranked eighth among member firms of the New York Stock Exchange in number of retail offices, with 93 retail sales offices located in the United States and Europe. Sale of Hornblower In January 1977 Loeb, Rhoades & Co. agreed to a merger with Hornblower, Weeks, Noyes & Trask to form Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. The merger turned out to be disastrous for both firms. The two firms incurred significant costs attempting to merge their back office operations, both of which had issues prior to the merger. By the end of 1978, less than a year after the merger, the combined firm was losing millions of dollars. Through the 1960s and 1970s, Sanford I. Weill was acquiring brokerage firms and by 1979 was running Shearson Hayden Stone, the culmination of nearly a dozen acquisitions. By early 1979, Hornblower, now known part of the larger Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. was suffering and looking for a potential acquiror. During Mothers Day Weekend 1979, Loeb and Shearson agreed to a merger to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades. Weill was named the CEO of the combined firm and John Loeb became the firm's chairman. At the time, Shearson Loeb Rhoades was among the largest investment banking houses with $250 million of equity capital.Loeb Capital Partners timeline Successors Following the merger with Shearson, the Hornblower name was retired permanently. Just two years later, in 1981, Weill sold the combined company to American Express to form Shearson/American Express. Shortly after the merger with Shearson, Ralph Hornblower Jr. and Ralph (Ray) Hornblower III formed a new company, named Hornblower & Company with offices in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Ray Hornblower was a running back for the Harvard Football team in the 1968 tie game against Yale, featured in the documentary film Harvard Beats Yale 29-29.

Even the violin strings were tuned automatically. Virtuoso Violin is a violin- playing machine, invented by Fred Paroutaud for QRS Music Technologies, the same company that produced the first MIDI-compatible player piano. It was first unveiled February 13, 1998. Mechanics The Virtuoso uses an electromagnet instead of fingering the strings. The electromagnet's position changes the behavior of the vibrating string to attain the desired pitch. Compatibility The Virtuoso is designed to play a real violin, although its setup requires the strings to be restrung and the bridge to be removed and replaced with a mechanical bridge which controls the string oscillation and bow movement. The Virtuoso Violin is capable of playing standard MIDI files. Reception The Virtuoso Violin was debuted at the Frankfurt Music Trade Show, and guests were both excited about the new invention and confused as to how it worked. The novelty of the digital-to-analog player violin has been a huge hit, and the Virtuoso Violin has been used as a replacement to the concertmaster soloist at concerts mainly for show reasons. The price of the violin was originally estimated at under $10,000 just before its release. In 2003, its price was $12,500 and has risen since to nearly $22,000. The sound projected by the Virtuoso Violin lacks the same quality found in a human violinist's playing, largely due to the inability for the device to spontaneously play emotionally.

Because of its dwindling population, the UNHCR merged Goldhap into the nearby Beldangi refugee camps. The camp is located near the settlement of Goldhap, along the Thulo Bato Road, directly abutting the Charali Jungle in Jhapa. Inhabitants Goldhap is the smallest of the seven Bhutanese refugee camps in Nepal. Its 2002 population was about 9,000, which fell by 2011 to just over 4,600 thanks to third-country resettlement. After settling in the different camps, politically interested people formed many political organizations. Most of the people in the camps are Hindus, and the rest are Buddhists also few Christians. There were no other religions in the camp at first, but later some people joined religions other than Hinduism and Buddhism. Schools in Goldhap Blooming Lotus English School accepts grade 6 to 10 (usually 7-10), focusing on college preparation. Some students return to teach or go on to hold important positions. In the Pathsala of the Goldhap Camp religious books are also taught, include Geeta and Vishnu sahasranama. The Institute of Fine Art and Commercial Art (IFACA-BHUTAN) teaches fine arts and focuses on helping young refugee children to express their feeling and restart their new life. The program began under the trees with limited materials but moved to a Caritas-built school, Blooming Lotus English School (BLES). This institute has been working for years to raise awareness of the Bhutanese Refugee issues regarding health, environmental sanitation, education, human rights, women's rights, children's rights, firefighting, and bird flu. They work in co-ordination with different UN agencies, Nepali government, local organizations and peoples in refugees camp by making posters, banners, pamphlets, boards and awareness exhibitions. In addition to advocacy, this institute has produced hundreds of Bhutanese artists from the Jhapa and Morang refugee camps in Nepal. Govinda Dhungana, who received primary education at Blooming Lotus English school, is the first screen actor from Bhutan. Physical Features The camp is surrounded by rivers on three sides and a small stream on the fourth side. To the east, there is a big forest. To the west, north and south there is another forest and villages. The names of the river are Deuney and Baitarney. The city of Birtamode is located a few miles away from the camp, and the Chandragadhi Airport is located a few kilometers away. Fire of 2011 On March 23, 2011, large fire burned through most of Goldhap refugee camp including residential areas and the camp health center, leaving some 3,790 refugees homeless. The same day, a separate fire scorched Sanischare, another nearby Bhutanese refugee camp, claiming 1,200 homes. Previously, there was a big fire on March 1, 2008, which destroyed about 1000 huts.

The tropical wave that spawned Brenda moved off the west coast of Africa on August 9, and uneventfully traversed the Atlantic. By August 18, an associated area of low pressure developed sufficient convective activity to be declared a tropical depression. Later that day, the system intensified into a tropical storm before moving inland over the Yucatan Peninsula. Brenda had moved back over water by August 21 and began to quickly intensify, with an eye forming later that day. The storm peaked as an upper-end Category 1 hurricane with winds of before making landfall in Campeche. The hurricane rapidly weakened after moving over land and dissipated the following day. Brenda made two landfalls in Mexico: first in the Yucatan and later in Campeche. Little damage resulted from the storm throughout the Yucatan Peninsula. However, severe damage took place in areas near Brenda's second landfall. A total of 10 people were killed by the hurricane and over 2,000 more were left homeless. Flooding caused by Brenda was considered to be the worst in over 25 years in some places. Meteorological history Hurricane Brenda originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August 9; however, the initial wave quickly weakened upon entering the Atlantic Ocean. By August 13, the wave began to regenerate as it passed through the Lesser Antilles, producing scattered shower and thunderstorm activity. Several days later, convection associated with the system consolidated into a central, organized mass and on August 18, the system had become sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression. Early the next day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Brenda following reports of gale-force winds from ships in the vicinity of the storm. Prior to its first landfall, Brenda suddenly intensified, with the central barometric pressure decreasing to 992 mbar (hPa; 29.29 inHg) and winds reached . The storm moved inland roughly north of Cozumel at the northern edge of the Yucatan Peninsula on August 19. Roughly 24 hours after landfall, the center of Brenda passed directly over the city of M√©rida, Yucat√°n. By this time, a strong ridge over southern Texas and northern Mexico caused the storm to take an unusual southwest turn. Later on August 20, the center of Brenda moved into the Gulf of Mexico, specifically the Bay of Campeche. Once back over water, Brenda began to quickly intensify, attaining hurricane status later that day. The next day, a well-defined eye had developed and the storm attained its peak intensity as a high-end Category 1 hurricane with winds of and a minimum pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg). Around this time, the tropical storm force winds extended out to the north and to the south. The storm made landfall later that day near Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico at this intensity, becoming the first hurricane to strike the region on record. After moving inland, Brenda rapidly weakened to a depression by the morning of August 22 and dissipated later that day. Impact and aftermath The tropical wave that spawned Brenda produced significant amounts of rainfall in the Cayman Islands as it became better organized. Upwards of was recorded on Grand Cayman on August 17. Following its first landfall in the northern Yucatan, Brenda produced heavy rainfall and high winds, gusting near . Along the coast, waves were recorded up to . Offshore, a freighter with 25 crewman became trapped in the storm after its engines failed. The United States Coast Guard responded to the distress call sent out by the ship once Brenda had moved into the Gulf of Mexico on August 21. Already suffering from severe flooding that killed at least 18 people and left 200,000 homeless, Hurricane Brenda worsened the situation with torrential rainfall and additional flooding. Following the damage wrought by Brenda, a large earthquake struck the region, hampering relief efforts and collapsing numerous structures. Winds on land gusted up to , leading to severe wind damage. Brenda caused a total of 10 deaths. Two of the fatalities occurred in Campeche after 80% of the city was flooded. Two more of these deaths occurred in the coastal city of Veracruz. This was considered to be the worst flooding in the city in over 25 years. According to officials, 452 homes and the local docks were destroyed in the region. An estimated 2,000 people were left homeless as a direct result of Brenda throughout Mexico.

Askew grew up in Bakewell,DerbyshireRichard Hall, \\"Queen trumps Fleet St joker\\", The Guardian, 13 December 1981 and had a meteoric rise, becoming editor of the Matlock Meteor aged 21. Whilst working for the Lancashire Evening Post, he won the IPC National Press Awards Campaigning Journalist award in 1972,Simon Winchester, \\"Guardian writers honoured\\", The Guardian, 29 March 1972 having become editor of the paper in 1969. At the Evening Post, Askew orchestrated investigations which uncovered abuses at Whittingham Hospital which started the ball rolling which ultimately led to the end of institutional care for people with mental illness. He went on to serve on the Davies Committee, set up in the wake of the Whittingham affair to reform hospital complaints procedures. He also led investigations into police corruption which culminated in the sacking of Chief Constable, Stanley Parr. During this period, Askew also fronted successful TV programmes for BBC North including Ask Askew and Wait Awhile. In 1979, a phone call intended for Askew and recorded by a receptionist at the paper's Fishergate headquarters created national headlines. Purporting to be the Yorkshire Ripper, a man with a Wearside accent referred to the unsolved murder of Joan Harrison, murdered in a derelict Preston garage in 1975. Seriously wrong-footing the police hunt, the phone call was later found to be a hoax. In 2006, a 49-year-old unemployed man, John Humble, was convicted of perverting the course of justice. Askew was appointed as editor of the News of the World,Philip Jordan, \\"News of the World replaces editor\\", The Guardian, 30 December 1981 partly on the recommendation of Harold Evans, editor of The Times. Arriving in Fleet Street in April 1981, he was by then the archetypal hard-drinking, hard-living hack, soon to be lampooned by Private Eye as \\"The Beast of Bouverie Street\\". With circulation of the News of the World in free-fall, his bold launch of a colour magazine quickly reversed the decline. However, behind the scenes he was enduring an increasingly fractious relationship with the paper's owner Rupert Murdoch. Matters soon came to a dramatic head over Sonia Sutcliffe, wife of the Yorkshire Ripper. Askew thought he had successfully negotiated a successful deal for her story, but suddenly the Murdoch coffers clanged firmly shut. The final straw came when in early December, he came into conflict with the Queen after claiming that if Princess Diana felt harassed by press photographers she should send a servant out to shop for her. At the end of the month, he left the newspaper, and spent the rest of his career in various short-term provincial posts.\\"Regrets? I‚Äôve had a few\\", British Journalism Review, Vol 17, No 3 (2006) Askew also had a successful radio and television career, regularly presenting Granada Television's What the Papers Say. Not much is known of his private life, however, a secret relationship with a young Sheffield nurse did result in the birth of their son David in October 1965.

Service The 6th Alabama Cavalry Regiment was organized near Pine Level early in 1863, This regiment was part of a brigade commanded by Brigadier-General James Holt Clanton (1827‚Äì1871), a Montgomery attorney that had served as a U.S. Army private in the Mexican War during 1848. In November 1861 Clanton had raised and commanded the 1st Alabama Cavalry as a Colonel, a regiment that served with distinction at the bloody Battle of Shiloh (April 1862). Clanton's new brigade included not only the 6th but also the 7th Alabama Cavalry, the 57th and 61st Alabama Infantry, and two batteries of artillery. First posted to the south Alabama town of Pollard, Clanton and his brigade were ordered to north Alabama in February 1864. They would be headquartered at Gadsden in Etowah County on the east bank of the Coosa River with their mission being to protect the coal and iron sections in that area, protect the public works at Selma, and to organize and complete the 8th Alabama Cavalry. By this time the 6th Cavalry had already moved to Meridian, MS but was ordered to rejoin Clanton in Gadsden. The 6th was subsequently involved in several skirmishes with elements of the Federal XV and XIV Corps near Decatur, Danville and the Paint Rock River with small loss. In the savage fighting of the Atlanta-Dalton campaign in May‚ÄìJune 1864 the regiment lost quite a number of men during the several weeks they were attached as part of Ferguson's and Armstrong's brigades. In June 1864 Maj. Gen. Lovell Rousseau was ordered by Gen. Sherman to start from Nashville and move south. Units to be under his command included the 8th Indiana, 2nd Kentucky, 4th Tennessee, 9th Ohio, and 5th Iowa cavalry regiments. Most of this cavalry, except the 4th Tennessee, were dismounted due to the difficulty in obtaining horses so Rousseau was forced to take horses from other regiments. Also, accompanying General Rousseau were guns from the 1st Michigan Artillery. This command was to move through Decatur and to move slowly to Blountsville and Ashville. And, if the way was clear, to cross the Coosa River at the Ten Island Ford or the railroad bridge with the ultimate goal of breaking up the Montgomery and West Point Railroad between Tuskegee and Opelika. When hearing of the approach of the Union troops Clanton moved with Lieutenant Colonel Washington T. Lary and the 6th Alabama Cavalry toward Greensport and positioned his troops. The resulting fighting was disastrous for General Clanton and his valiant men, particularly the 6th Alabama Cavalry. Lieutenant Colonel Lary and his Executive Officer, Major E.A. McWhorter were captured. Transferred to West Florida, the 6th fought Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele's column at Bluff Springs and Lt. Col. Andrew Spurling's column at Milton with many prisoners taken. 6th Alabama Cavalry flag The flag of the 6th Alabama Cavalry was captured on March 25, 1865, by Private Thomas Riley, Co. D, 1st Louisiana Cavalry during an engagement which took place between Canoe Creek, Alabama and the Escambia River prior to the Battle of Fort Blakely. Private Riley was recommended for and received the Medal of Honor. The flag was forwarded to the U.S. War Department where it was assigned Capture Number 453. The flag and its staff were returned to the State of Alabama effective April 26, 1905. This flag received conservation treatment and was prepared for display by Textile Preservation Associates, Inc. of Sharpsburg, MD in March 1999. There are many references of a Rudolph Riddell with the 61st New York capturing the flag of the 6th Alabama Cavalry on April 6, 1864, at the Battle of Sailor's Creek during the Appomattox Campaign, in Virginia. There is no record of this Alabama Cavalry regiment ever being in Virginia but the brigade facing these New York troops included the 6th Alabama Infantry. That probably was the unit that should have been referenced in the Medal of Honor citation. At the end of the war the remnant of the 6th fought Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson's column and laid down their arms at Gainesville, AL, fewer than 200 men.

In the Tesio, he beat a field of local horses and New York shippers. Boniface and owner Charles Oliver then entered Oliver's Twist in the 1995 Preakness Stakes to take on an r field of eleven stakes winners. Oliver's Twist was the third longest shot in the field at post time at 12-,1 ahead of only Pana Brass and Itron. Four of the five top Derby finishers came back to run in the Preakness. As expected Thunder Gulch, Tejano Run, Timber Country and Mecke took most of the public support at the windows. As the Preakness began, speedster Star Standard shot to the lead, followed by Mystery Storm and Talkin Man. Oliver's Twist saved ground along the rail and settled in fifth. Under jockey Alberto Delgado, he split the leaders, cleared traffic, and engaged Derby winner Thunder Gulch. However, Timber Country won by 1 1/2 lengths. Oliver's Twist outdueled Thunder Gulch for second place and $100,000 in prize money.2007 Maryland Jockey Club Media Guide, page 132 on March 3, 2007.

Pairing lithium and ambient oxygen can theoretically lead to electrochemical cells with the highest possible specific energy. Indeed, the theoretical specific energy of a non- aqueous Li‚Äìair battery, in the charged state with Li2O2 product and excluding the oxygen mass, is ~40.1 MJ/kg. This is comparable to the theoretical specific energy of gasoline, ~46.8 MJ/kg. In practice, Li‚Äìair batteries with a specific energy of ~6.12 MJ/kg at the cell level have been demonstrated. This is about 5 times greater than that of a commercial lithium-ion battery, and is sufficient to run a 2,000 kg EV for ~ on one charge using 60 kg of batteries. However, the practical power and life-cycle of Li‚Äìair batteries need significant improvements before they can find a market niche. Significant electrolyte advances are needed to develop a commercial implementation. Four approaches are active: aprotic, aqueous, solid state and mixed aqueous‚Äìaprotic. Metal‚Äìair batteries, specifically zinc‚Äìair, have received attention due to potentially high energy densities. The theoretical specific energy densities for metal‚Äìair batteries are higher than for ion-based methods. Lithium‚Äìair batteries can theoretically achieve 3840 mA¬∑h/g. A major market driver for batteries is the automotive sector. The energy density of gasoline is approximately 13 kW¬∑h/kg, which corresponds to 1.7 kW¬∑h/kg of energy provided to the wheels after losses. Theoretically, lithium‚Äìair can achieve 12 kW¬∑h/kg (43.2 MJ/kg) excluding the oxygen mass. Accounting for the weight of the full battery pack (casing, air channels, lithium substrate), while lithium alone is very light, the energy density is considerably lower. A Li‚Äìair battery potentially had 5‚Äì15 times the specific energy of a Li-ion battery .  History  Originally proposed in the 1970s as a possible power source for battery electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles, Li‚Äìair batteries recaptured scientific interest late in the first decade of the 2000s due to advances in materials science. Although the idea of a lithium‚Äìair battery was around long before 1996, the risk-to-benefit ratio was perceived as too high to pursue. Indeed, both the negative (lithium metal) and the positive (air or oxygen) electrodes are the reasons why, respectively, rechargeable lithium-metal batteries failed to reach the market in the 1970s (the lithium-ion battery in a mobile device uses a LiC6-graphite compound on the negative electrode, not a lithium metal). Nevertheless, due to a perceived lack of other alternatives to high specific energy rechargeable batteries, and due to some initially promising results from academic labs, both the number of patents and of free-domain publications related to lithium‚Äìoxygen (including Li‚Äìair) batteries began growing exponentially in 2006.Ogasawara, D√©bart et al. 2006 However, the technical difficulties facing such batteries, especially recharging times, nitrogen and water sensitivity, and Lee, Roev et al. 2015 the intrinsic poor conductivity of the charged Li2O2 species are major challenges.  Design and operation  Schematic of lithium‚Äìair battery charge and discharge cycles In general lithium ions move between the anode and the cathode across the electrolyte. Under discharge, electrons follow the external circuit to do electric work and the lithium ions migrate to the cathode. During charge the lithium metal plates onto the anode, freeing at the cathode. Both non-aqueousMcCloskey, Burke et al. 2015 (with Li2O2 or LiO2 as the discharge products) and aqueous (LiOH as the discharge product) Li-O2 batteries have been considered.Balaish, Kraytsberg, et al. 2014Imanishi and Yamamoto 2014 The aqueous battery requires a protective layer on the negative electrode to keep the Li metal from reacting with water. Schematic of artificial vs. spontaneous electrolyte interface  Anode  Lithium metal is the typical anode choice. At the anode, electrochemical potential forces the lithium metal to release electrons via oxidation (without involving the cathodic oxygen). The half-reaction is: :: Li Li+ \\\\+ e‚àí Lithium has high specific capacity (3840 mAh/g) compared with other metal‚Äìair battery materials (820 mAh/g for Zinc, 2965 mAh/g for aluminium). Several issues affect such cells. The main challenge in anode development is preventing the anode from reacting with the electrolyte. Alternatives include new electrolyte materials or redesigning the interface between electrolyte and anode. Lithium anodes risk dendritic lithium deposits, decreasing energy capacity or triggering a short circuit. The effects of pore size and pore size distribution remain poorly understood. Upon charging/discharging in aprotic cells, layers of lithium salts precipitate onto the anode, eventually covering it and creating a barrier between the lithium and electrolyte. This barrier initially prevents corrosion, but eventually inhibits the reaction kinetics between the anode and the electrolyte. This chemical change of the solid‚Äìelectrolyte interface (SEI) results in varying chemical composition across the surface, causing the current to vary accordingly. The uneven current distribution furthers branching dendrite growth and typically leads to a short circuit between the anode and cathode. In aqueous cells problems at the SEI stem from the high reactivity of lithium metal with water. Several approaches attempt to overcome these problems: * Formation of a Li-ion protective layer using di- and triblock copolymer electrolytes. According to Seeo, Inc., such electrolytes (e.g., polystyrene with the high Li-ion conductivity of a soft polymer segment, such as a poly(ethylene oxide (PEO) and Li-salt mixture) ) combine the mechanical stability of a hard polymer segment with the high ionic conductivity of the soft polymer‚Äìlithium-salt mixture. The hardness inhibits dendrite shorts via mechanical blocking. * Li-ion conducting glass or glass- ceramic materials are (generally) readily reduced by lithium metal, and therefore a thin film of a stable lithium conducting material, such as or , can be inserted between the ceramic and metal. This ceramic-based SEI inhibits the formation of dendrites and protects the lithium metal from atmospheric contamination.  Cathode  At the cathode during charge, oxygen donates electrons to the lithium via reduction. Mesoporous carbon has been used as a cathode substrate with metal catalysts that enhance reduction kinetics and increase the cathode's specific capacity. Manganese, cobalt, ruthenium, platinum, silver, or a mixture of cobalt and manganese are potential metal catalysts. Under some circumstances manganese-catalyzed cathodes performed best, with a specific capacity of 3137 mA¬∑H/g carbon and cobalt-catalyzed cathodes performed second best, with a specific capacity of 2414 mA¬∑H/g carbon. Based on the first pore-scale modeling of lithium‚Äìair batteries, the micro-structure of the cathode significantly affects battery capacity in both non-pore-blocking and pore-blocking regimes. Most Li‚Äìair battery limits are at the cathode, which is also the source of its potential advantages. Atmospheric oxygen must be present at the cathode, but contaminants such as water vapor can damage it. Incomplete discharge due to blockage of the porous carbon cathode with discharge products such as lithium peroxide (in aprotic designs) is the most serious. Catalysts have shown promise in creating preferential nucleation of over , which is irreversible with respect to lithium. Li‚Äìair performance is limited by the efficiency of the reaction at the cathode, because most of the voltage drop occurs there. Multiple chemistries have been assessed, distinguished by their electrolyte. This discussion focuses on aprotic and aqueous electrolytes as solid-state electrochemistry is poorly understood. In a cell with an aprotic electrolyte lithium oxides are produced through reduction at the cathode: : Li+ \\\\+ e‚àí \\\\+ + * ‚Üí * : Li+ \\\\+ e‚àí +* ‚Üí* where \\"*\\" denotes a surface site on where growth proceeds, which is essentially a neutral Li vacancy in the surface. Lithium oxides are insoluble in aprotic electrolytes, which leads to cathode clogging. A nanowire array cathode augmented by a genetically modified M13 bacteriophage virus offers two to three times the energy density of 2015-era lithium-ion batteries. The virus increased the size of the nanowire array, which is about 80 nm across. The resulting wires had a spiked surface. Spikes create more surface area to host reaction sites. The viral process creates a cross-linked 3D structure, rather than isolated wires, stabilizing the electrode. The viral process is water- based and takes place at room temperature.  Electrolyte  Efforts in Li‚Äìair batteries have focused on four electrolytes: aqueous acidic, aqueous alkaline, non-aqueous protic, and aprotic. In a cell with an aqueous electrolyte the reduction at the cathode can also produce lithium hydroxide:  Aqueous  An aqueous Li‚Äìair battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an aqueous electrolyte and a porous carbon cathode. The aqueous electrolyte combines lithium salts dissolved in water. It avoids the issue of cathode clogging because the reaction products are water-soluble. The aqueous design has a higher practical discharge potential than its aprotic counterpart. However, lithium metal reacts violently with water and thus the aqueous design requires a solid electrolyte interface between the lithium and electrolyte. Commonly, a lithium-conducting ceramic or glass is used, but conductivity are generally low (on the order of 10‚àí3 S/cm at ambient temperatures). Schematic of a mixed aqueous‚Äìaprotic type Li‚Äìair battery design  Acidic electrolyte  : 2Li + ¬Ω + 2H+ ‚Üí 2Li+\\\\+ A conjugate base is involved in the reaction. The theoretical maximal Li‚Äìair cell specific energy and energy density are 1400 W¬∑h/kg and 1680 W¬∑h/l, respectively.  Alkaline aqueous electrolyte  : 2Li + ¬Ω + ‚Üí 2LiOH Water molecules are involved in the redox reactions at the air cathode. The theoretical maximal Li‚Äìair cell specific energy and energy density are 1300 W¬∑h/kg and 1520 W¬∑h/l, respectively. New cathode materials must account for the accommodation of substantial amounts of , and/or LiOH without causing the cathode pores to block and employ suitable catalysts to make the electrochemical reactions energetically practical. * Dual pore system materials offer the most promising energy capacity. ::* The first pore system serves as an oxidation product store. ::* The second pore system serves as oxygen transport.  Aprotic  Schematic of aprotic type Li‚Äìair battery design Non-aqueous Li‚Äìair batteries were demonstrated first.Abraham and Jiang 1996. They usually use mixed ethylene carbonate+ propylene carbonate solvents with LiPF6 or Li bis-sulfonimide salts like conventional Li-ion batteries, however, with a gelled rather than liquid electrolyte.Imanishi, Matsui, et al. 2014 The voltage difference upon constant current charge and discharge is usually between 1.3 and 1.8 V (with an OCP of ca. 4.2 V) even at such ridiculously low currents as 0.01‚Äì0.5 mA/cm¬≤ and 50‚Äì500 mA/g of C on the positive electrode (see Figure 2), However, the carbonate solvents evaporate and get oxidized due to a high overvoltage upon charge. Other solvents, such as end-capped glymes, DMSO, dimethylacetamide, and ionic liquids, have been considered. The carbon cathode gets oxidized above +3.5 V v Li during charge, forming Li2CO3, which leads to an irreversible capacity loss. Most effort involved aprotic materials, which consist of a lithium metal anode, a liquid organic electrolyte and a porous carbon cathode. The electrolyte can be made of any organic liquid able to solvate lithium salts such as , , , and ), but typically consisted of carbonates, ethers and esters. The carbon cathode is usually made of a high- surface-area carbon material with a nanostructured metal oxide catalyst (commonly or ). A major advantage is the spontaneous formation of a barrier between anode and electrolyte (analogous to the barrier formed between electrolyte and carbon‚Äìlithium anodes in conventional Li-ion batteries) that protects the lithium metal from further reaction with the electrolyte. Although rechargeable, the produced at the cathode is generally insoluble in the organic electrolyte, leading to buildup along the cathode/electrolyte interface. This makes cathodes in aprotic batteries prone to clogging and volume expansion that progressively reduces conductivity and degrades battery performance. Another issue is that organic electrolytes are flammable and can ignite if the cell is damaged. Although most studies agree that is the final discharge product of non-aqueous Li-O2 batteries, considerable evidence that its formation does not proceed as a direct 2-electron electroreduction to peroxide O (which is the common pathway for O2 reduction in water on carbon) but rather via a one‚Äìelectron reduction to superoxide O, followed by its disproportionation: Superoxide (O) has traditionally been considered as a dangerous intermediate in aprotic oxygen batteries due to its high nucleophilicity, basicity and redox potential However, reports suggest that LiO2 is both an intermediate during the discharge to peroxide () and can be used as the final discharge product, potentially with an improved cycle life albeit with a lower specific energy (a little heavier battery weight). Indeed, it was shown that under certain conditions, the superoxide can be stable on the scale of 20‚Äì70 h at room temperature. An irreversible capacity loss upon disproportionation of LiO2 in the charged battery was not addressed. Pt/C seems to be the best electrocatalyst for O2 evolution and Au/C for O2 reduction when is the product. Nevertheless, \\"the performance of rechargeable lithium‚Äìair batteries with non-aqueous electrolytes is limited by the reactions on the oxygen electrode, especially by O2 evolution. Conventional porous carbon air electrodes are unable to provide mAh/g and mAh/cm2 capacities and discharge rates at the magnitudes required for really high energy density batteries for EV applications.\\" The capacity (in mAh/cm2) and the cycle life of non-aqueous Li-O2 batteries is limited by the deposition of insoluble and poorly electronically conducting LiOx phases upon discharge. ( is predicted to have a better Li+ conductivity than the LiO2 and phases). This makes the practical specific energy of Li-O2 batteries significantly smaller than the reagent-level calculation predicts. It seems that these parameters have reached their limits, and further improvement is expected only from alternative methods. Schematic of aqueous type Li‚Äìair battery design  Mixed aqueous‚Äìaprotic  The aqueous‚Äìaprotic or mixed Li‚Äìair battery design attempts to unite advantages of the aprotic and aqueous battery designs. The common feature of hybrid designs is a two-part (one part aqueous and one part aprotic) electrolyte connected by a lithium-conducting membrane. The anode abuts the aprotic side while the cathode is in contact with the aqueous side. A lithium-conducting ceramic is typically employed as the membrane joining the two electrolytes. The use of a solid electrolyte (see Fig. 3) is one such alternative approaches that allows for a combination of a lithium metal anode with an aqueous cathode. Ceramic solid electrolytes (CSEs) of the NASICON family (e.g., Li1‚àíxAxM2‚àíx(PO4)3 with A ‚àà [Al, Sc, Y] and M ‚àà [Ti, Ge]) has been studied. Compatible with water at alkaline pH and having a large electrochemical window (see Figs. 3,4), their low Li+ ion conductivity near room temperature (< 0.005 S/cm, >85 Œ© cm2) makes them unsuitable for automotive and stationary energy storage applications that demand low cost (i.e., operating current densities over 100 mA/cm2). Further, both Ti and Ge are reduced by metallic Li, and an intermediate layer between the ceramic electrode and the negative electrode is required. In contrast, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) can provide a higher conductivity at the expense of a faster crossover of water and of other small molecules that are reactive toward metallic Li. Among the more exotic membranes considered for Li-O2 batteries is single-crystal silicon. In 2015 researchers announced a design that used highly porous graphene for the anode, an electrolyte of lithium bis(trifluoromethyl) sulfonylimide/dimethoxyethane with added water and lithium iodide for use as a \\"mediator\\". The electrolyte produces lithium hydroxide (LiOH) at the cathode instead of lithium peroxide (). The result offered energy efficiency of 93 percent (voltage gap of .2) and cycled more than 2,000 times with little impact on output. However, the design required pure oxygen, rather than ambient air. Schematic of solid-state type Li‚Äìair battery design  Solid state  A solid-state battery design is attractive for its safety, eliminating the chance of ignition from rupture. Current solid-state Li‚Äìair batteries use a lithium anode, a ceramic, glass, or glass-ceramic electrolyte, and a porous carbon cathode. The anode and cathode are typically separated from the electrolyte by polymer‚Äìceramic composites that enhance charge transfer at the anode and electrochemically couple the cathode to the electrolyte. The polymer‚Äìceramic composites reduce overall impedance. The main drawback of the solid-state battery design is the low conductivity of most glass-ceramic electrolytes. The ionic conductivity of current lithium fast ion conductors is lower than liquid electrolyte alternatives.  Challenges  As of 2013, many challenges confronted designers.  Cathode  Most Li‚Äìair battery limits are at the cathode, which is also the source of its potential advantages. Incomplete discharge due to blockage of the porous carbon cathode with discharge products such as lithium peroxide (in aprotic designs) is the most serious. Several modes of precipitates were modeled.Y. Wang, Modeling Discharge Deposit Formation and Its Effect on Lithium‚Äìair Battery Performance, Electrochimica Acta 75 (2012) 239‚Äì246. A parameter, Da, was defined to measure the variations of temperature, species concentration and potentials.Y. Wang and S. C. Cho, Analysis of Air Cathode Performance for Lithium‚Äìair Batteries, Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 160 (10) A1-A9 (2013).Y. Wang, Z. Wang, H. Yuan and T. Li, Discharge Oxide Storage Capacity And Voltage Loss In Li‚Äìair Battery, Electrochimica Acta, 180 (2015) 382‚Äì393 The effects of pore size and pore size distribution remain poorly understood. Catalysts have shown promise in creating preferential nucleation of over , which is irreversible with respect to lithium. Atmospheric oxygen must be present at the cathode, but contaminants such as water vapor can damage it.  Electrochemistry  In 2017 cell designs, the charge overpotential is much higher than the discharge overpotential. Significant charge overpotential indicates the presence of secondary reactions. Thus, electric efficiency is only around 65%. Catalysts such , Co, Pt and Au can potentially reduce the overpotentials, but the effect is poorly understood. Several catalysts improve cathode performance, notably , and the mechanism of improvement is known as surface oxygen redox providing abundant initial growth sites for lithium peroxide. It is also reported that catalysts may alter the structure of oxide deposits. Significant drops in cell capacity with increasing discharge rates are another issue. The decrease in cell capacity is attributed to kinetic charge transfer limits. Since the anodic reaction occurs very quickly, the charge transfer limits are thought to occur at the cathode.  Stability  Long-term battery operation requires chemical stability of all cell components. Current cell designs show poor resistance to oxidation by reaction products and intermediates. Many aqueous electrolytes are volatile and can evaporate over time. Stability is hampered in general by parasitic chemical reactions, for instance those involving reactive oxygen.  Applications   Vehicles  Li‚Äìair cells are of interest for electric vehicles, because of their high theoretical specific and volumetric energy density, comparable to petrol. Electric motors provide high efficiency (95% compared to 35% for an internal combustion engine). Li‚Äìair cells could offer range equivalent to today's vehicles with a battery pack one-third the size of standard fuel tanks assuming the balance of plant required to maintain the battery was of negligible mass or volume.  Grid backup  In 2014, researchers announced a hybrid solar cell-battery. Up to 20% of the energy produced by conventional solar cells is lost as it travels to and charges a battery. The hybrid stores nearly 100% of the energy produced. One version of the hybrid used a potassium-ion battery using potassium‚Äìair. It offered higher energy density than conventional Li-ion batteries, cost less and avoided toxic byproducts. The latest device essentially substituted lithium for potassium. The solar cell used a mesh made from microscopic rods of titanium dioxide to allow the needed oxygen to pass through. Captured sunlight produced electrons that decompose lithium peroxide into lithium ions, thereby charging the battery. During discharge, oxygen from air replenished the lithium peroxide.

A journal's SJR is a numeric value indicating the average number of weighted citations received during a selected year per document published in that journal during the previous three years. Higher SJR values are meant to indicate greater journal prestige. The SJR indicator is a variant of the eigenvector centrality measure used in network theory. Such measures establish the importance of a node in a network based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node. The SJR indicator has been developed to be used in extremely large and heterogeneous journal citation networks. It is a size-independent indicator and its values order journals by their \\"average prestige per article\\" and can be used for journal comparisons in science evaluation processes. The SJR indicator is a free journal metric inspired by, and using an algorithm similar to, PageRank. The SJR indicator provides an alternative to the impact factor (IF) or average citations per document in a 2-year period, abbreviated as \\"Cites per Doc. (2y)\\".  Rationale  If scientific impact is considered related to the number of endorsements, in the form of citations, a journal receives, then prestige can be understood as a combination of the number of endorsements and the prestige or importance of the journals issuing them. The SJR indicator assigns different values to citations depending on the importance of the journals where they come from. This way, citations coming from highly important journals will be more valuable and hence will provide more prestige to the journals receiving them. The calculation of the SJR indicator is similar to the Eigenfactor score, with the former being based on the Scopus database and the latter on the Web of Science database, and there are other differences.  Computation  The SJR indicator computation is carried out using an iterative algorithm that distributes prestige values among the journals until a steady-state solution is reached. The SJR algorithm begins by setting an identical amount of prestige to each journal, then using an iterative procedure, this prestige is redistributed in a process where journals transfer their achieved prestige to each other through citations. The process ends up when the difference between journal prestige values in consecutive iterations do not reach a minimum threshold value any more. The process is developed in two phases, (a) the computation of Prestige SJR (PSJR) for each journal: a size-dependent measure that reflects the whole journal prestige, and (b) the normalization of this measure to achieve a size- independent measure of prestige, the SJR indicator.

History The history of the ‚ÄúThirty Mass‚Äù practice goes back to the year 590 A.D. in St. Andrew‚Äôs Monastery in Rome, founded by St. Gregory the Great in his own family villa around 570. It is now known as the Monastery of St. Gregory the Great. The account of the incident which gave rise to it is recounted by St. Gregory himself in his Dialogues. After his election as Pope in 590, one of the monks, Justus by name, became ill. So he admitted to a lay friend, Copiosus, that he had hidden three gold pieces among his medications years before, when he was professed a monk. Both, in fact, were former physicians. And sure enough, the other monks found the gold when seeking the medication for Justus. The founder and former abbot of the monastery, now Pope Gregory, hearing of this scandalous sin against the monastic Rule, called in the new Abbot of his beloved monastery, and ordered the penalty of solitary confinement for Justus, even though he was dying, and ordered that his burial not be in the cemetery but in the garbage dump. Copiosus told his wretched friend of this decision. Moreover, the community were to recite over his dreadful grave the words of St. Peter to Simon the Magician: ‚ÄúMay your money perish with you‚Äù (Acts 8:20). The Pope‚Äôs desired result was achieved: Justus made a serious repentance, and all the monks a serious examination of conscience. Justus then died, but the matter did not, for thirty days later Pope Gregory returned to the monastery filled with concern for Justus, who would now be suffering the grim temporal punishment of Purgatory‚Äôs fire for his sins. ‚ÄúWe must,‚Äù said Gregory to the Abbot, ‚Äúcome by charity to his aid, and as far as possible help him to escape this chastisement. Go and arrange thirty Masses for his soul, so that for thirty consecutive days the Saving Victim is immolated for him without fail.‚Äù And so it was done. Some days later, the deceased monk, Justus, appeared in a vision to his friend Copiosus and said, ‚ÄúI have just received the Communion pardon and release from Purgatory because of the Masses said for me.‚Äù The monks did a calculation, and noted that it was exactly thirty days since the thirty Masses had begun for Justus. They shared this great consolation with each other, with their Abbott and with Pope Gregory. The Pope included a full account of this episode. Privileged altar When the practice began, it was limited solely to services held at the main altar at the Monastery of St. Andrew in Rome, where this had taken place. As time went by, this \\"privilege\\" was extended to a few other altars in the city of Rome. Eventually this practice became common in monasteries. A monk of the great Abbey of Cluny in the 11th century attested that such Masses were said daily in that period, with the exception of the major feastdays of the year, such as Easter. \\"The Thirty Gregorian Masses\\" by the Rev. Stepehen Somerville In the modern era, the practice was authorized for all churches throughout the world.

Some alleged the arrest was politically motivated due to Afreeca being used by protesters to coordinate. On September 27, 2012, AfreecaTV English was released on the Google Play store. One example of expansion of Afreeca's role is the hosting of a live talk session with Mayor Park of Seoul, broadcast live online and via mobile on AfreecaTV. He used the platform as a way to conduct a community scanning forum to collect public opinions and allow bloggers with various areas of expertise to participate in the dialogue. The bloggers were able to address the problems facing Seoul and propose solutions in their areas of expertise, while also exchanging ideas with Mayor Park in an in-depth discussion on the administration of the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Depending on rising of power of AfreecaTV, many Idol Groups participate in AfreecaTV for their fans, for example, Nine Muses. Controversy There have been many social problems with Afreeca TV such as offers for sexual favors and abasement of disabled individuals. Many broadcasters were involved in these incidents, and they were punished by managers of Afreeca TV by suspension of their IDs. Due to such problems, mass media in South Korea have shown concern about the effects of personal broadcasting platforms. A claim was made that audience overloading has caused overpayment of fees for Internet broadcasting. In light of this, Korea's Clean Internet Broadcasting Council came to an agreement with Afreeca TV to reduce the payment maximum to less than 1 million won (a little less than US$900) per day by June 2008.

The Nevada Journal provides in-depth coverage of local and regional issues as well as sports and is the official newspaper for the City of Nevada. National news coverage is provided on a daily basis by the Des Moines Register and the Ames Tribune. ;Radio and television While Nevada has no broadcast stations of its own, it is well served from the Ames-Des Moines television and radio markets. Nevada is featured in John Darnielle's 2017 novel Universal Harvester.  Transportation  Nevada is served by US Highway 30 which was known as the Lincoln Highway and Lincoln Way in town. It bisects Nevada north and south through the business district. A new US Highway 30 bypass was built in the 1970s to the south of the city and Lincoln Way through town was reduced to county road status. Iowa Highway 133 now connects the business district to the new US Highway 30 to the south. Nevada is also served well by a network of paved farm to market county roads. Nevada was served by the Chicago and North Western Railroad. The Union Pacific Railroad now owns the line which crosses the city east to west north of the business district. Up until the mid-1980s, all railroad crossings except for a new one in the northwest section of town were protected by WRRS center harp style wigwag signals. Shortly thereafter, these signals were replaced with standard flashers and gates due to safety concerns and lack of available wigwag parts. Nevada was also served by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad's \\"Spine Line\\" between Minneapolis, MN and Kansas City, MO. This north-south line jogged east-west through southern Nevada. It then veered north again and crossed under the C&NW; mainline east of Nevada. An agency station was maintained until 1980 when the Rock Island went bankrupt and ceased to function. The C&NW; purchased the Rock Island \\"Spine Line\\" which offered better and more direct connections for Minneapolis and Kansas City. Since the two rail lines did not directly interchange east of town where the C&NW; crosses over the Rock Island, a new connection on the west side of Nevada was built. It goes from the C&NW; east- west main line to connect with the former Rock Island on the southwest side of Nevada.The North Western; pp 231-4; H. Roger Grant; 1996 The junction on the Spine Line was referred to as \\"Chicago Junction\\" while the junction on the east-west mainline was referred to as \\"Kansas City Junction\\". This new line necessitated the building of an overpass for the old Lincoln Highway on the west side of Nevada. The Union Pacific Railroad purchased the Chicago and North Western Railroad in 1995. Rail traffic on both the east-west mainline and the \\"Spine Line\\" along with interchange traffic has increased considerably in the years since the purchase.

Built in 1925 as the R.S. McLaughlin Building, the Gothic Revival building was one of the first automobile dealerships in Toronto, and remained continuously occupied by car dealerships for eighty-two years. Despite its long history, that use ended as part of a reorganization and consolidation of the car dealership industry in Canada. Due to the soft soil at the site, and to facilitate excavation, the historic facade was dismantled and stored off-site during construction of the seven-floor underground garage. After the garage and foundation appropriate for the fifty floors above ground were completed, the facade was reconstructed, incorporating the important heritage components. The historic building is marked with a plaque, placed in 2013 by Heritage Toronto.

Usually, prevalent symptoms include canker sores or ulcers in the mouth and on the genitals, and inflammation in parts of the eye. In addition, patients experience severe headache and papulopustular skin lesions as well. The disease was first described in 1937 by a Turkish dermatologist, Dr. Hulusi Beh√ßet. Beh√ßet's disease is most prevalent in the Middle East and the Far East regions; however, it is rare in America regions. Beh√ßet's disease with neurological involvement, neuro-Beh√ßet's disease (NBD), involves central nervous system damage in 5‚Äì50% of cases. The high variation in the range is due to study design, definition of neurological involvement, ethnic or geographic variation, availability of neurological expertise and investigations, and treatment protocols. Signs and symptoms The initial signs and symptoms of NBD are usually very general. This makes NBD hard to diagnose until the patients experience a severe neurological damage. In addition, the combination of symptoms varies among patients. Parenchymal neuro-Beh√ßet's disease The main symptom is meningoencephalitis which happens in ~75% of NBD patients. Other general symptoms of Beh√ßet's disease are also present among parenchymal NBD patients such as fever, headache, genital ulcers, genital scars, and skin lesions. When the brainstem is affected, ophthalmoparesis, cranial neuropathy, and cerebellar or pyramidal dysfunction may be observed. Cerebral hemispheric involvement may result in encephalopathy, hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, seizures, dysphasia, and mental changes including cognitive dysfunction and psychosis. As for the spinal cord involvement, pyramidal signs in the limbs, sensory level dysfunction, and, commonly, sphincter dysfunction may be observed. Some of the symptoms are less common such as stroke (1.5%), epilepsy (2.2‚Äì5%), brain tumor, movement disorder, acute meningeal syndrome, and optic neuropathy. Non-parenchymal neuro-Beh√ßet's disease Because Non-parenchymal NBD targets vascular structures, the symptoms arise in the same area. The main clinical characteristic is the cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). If one experiences CVT, a clot in one of the blood vessels in the brain blocks the blood flow and may result in stroke. This happens in the dural venous sinuses. Stroke-like symptoms such as confusion, weakness, and dizziness may be monitored. Headache tends to worsen over the period of several days. Some of the less common symptoms include intracranial hypertension and intracranial aneurysms. Causes Because the cause of Beh√ßet's disease is unknown, the cause responsible for neuro-Beh√ßet's disease is unknown as well. Inflammation starts mainly due to immune system failure. However, no one knows what factors trigger the initiation of auto-immune disease like inflammation. Because the cause is unknown, it is impossible to eliminate or prevent the source that causes the disease. Therefore, treatments are focused on how to suppress the symptoms that hinder daily life activities. Diagnosis Although there is a diagnostic criterion for Beh√ßet's disease, one for neuro-Beh√ßet's disease does not exist. Three diagnostic tools are mainly used. Blood test 60‚Äì70% of Japanese and Turkish patients were tested to possess HLA-B51, HLA-B serotype. These patients showed 6 times risk of getting BD. However, the same criteria is not ideal to be applied for Europeans because only 10‚Äì20% of European patients showed to possess HLA-B51. Cerebrospinal fluid level Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear bodily fluid that occupies the subarachnoid space and the ventricular system around and inside the brain. It is revealed that 70‚Äì80% of Parenchymal NBD patients show altered CSF constituents. The observed different is 1) Elevated CSF protein concentration (1 g/dL), 2) Absence of oligoclonal band, and 3) elevated CSF cell count (0‚Äì400√ó10‚Å∂ cells/L) in the body. Others \\"...Despite its rarity, the patient's ethnic background and the typical radiographic findings should prompt the clinicians to include NBD in the differential diagnosis of optic neuritis and demyelinating disease in the young...\\"[5]. This quote indicates that even common symptoms such as headache should be recognized as the sign for possible NBD considering the patient's ethnic background. Types There are two types of neuro-Beh√ßet's disease: parenchymal and non-parenchymal. The two types of neuro-Beh√ßet's disease rarely occur in the same person. It is suggested that the pathogenesis of the two types are probably different.[3] Statistics indicate that approximately 75% (772 of 1031) BD patients advanced to parenchymal NBD while 17.7% (183 of 1031) of BD patients advanced to non- parenchymal NBD. The remaining 7.3% were not able to be categorized. Parenchymal If one experiences parenchymal neuro-Beh√ßet's disease, meningoencephalitis, inflammation of brain, primarily occurs. The target areas of parenchymal NBD include brainstem, spinal cord, and cerebral regions. Sometimes it is hard to determine the affected area because patients are asymptomatic. Non-parenchymal In non-parenchymal NBD, vascular complications such as cerebral venous thrombosis primarily occurs. Other distinct characteristics include intracranial aneurysm and extracranial aneurysm. In most cases, veins are much more likely to be affected than arteries. Venous sinus thrombosis is the most frequent vascular manifestation in NBD followed by cortical cerebral veins thrombosis. On the other hand, thrombosis and aneurysms of the large cerebral arteries are rarely reported.Tunc R, Saip S, Siva A, Yazici H. Cerebral venous thrombosis is associated with major vessel disease in Beh√ßet's syndrome. Ann Rheum Dis 2004; 63: 1693‚Äì94. Others Peripheral nervous system involvement is rarely reported (~0.8%). In this case, Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, sensorimotor neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, autonomic neuropathy, and subclinical nerve-conduction abnormalities are observed. Some of the syndromes are not common but recognized for the relation to NBD such as acute meningeal syndrome, tumor-like neuro-Beh√ßet's disease, psychiatric symptoms and optic neuropathy. Treatment No definite standard treatment have been set. This is because treatments of the disease has been poorly studied as of 2014. Often in cases of inflammatory parenchymal disease, \\"corticosteroids should be given as infusions of intravenous methylprednisolone followed by a slowly tapering course of oral steroids\\". It is suggested that therapy should be continued for a period of time even when the symptoms get suppressed because early relapse may occur. Sometimes, the medical doctors may suggest a different steroid depending on the nature of the disease, the severity, and the response to steroids. According to several studies, parenchymal NBD patients successfully suppress the symptoms with the prescribed steroids. As for non-parenchymal patients, there is no general consensus on how to treat the disease. The reason is that the mechanisms of cerebral venous thrombosis in BD are still poorly understood. Some doctors use anti-coagulants to prevent a clot. On the other hand, some doctors only give steroids and immunosuppressants alone. Epidemiology In one study of 387 Beh√ßet's disease (BD) patients that has been done for 20 years, 13% of men with BD developed to NBD and 5.6% of women developed to NBD. Combining all statistical reports, approximately 9.4% (43 of 459) BD patients advanced to NBD. In addition, men were 2.8 times more likely to experience NBD than women. This fact indicates possible gender-based pathology.Barros R, Santos E, Moreira B, et al. Clinical characterization and pattern of neurological involvement of Beh√ßet's disease in fifteen Portuguese patients\\" Clin Exp Rheumatol 2007; 24 In speaking about age of NBD patients, the general range was between 20 and 40. NBD patients with age less than 10 or more than 50 were very uncommon.

On its banks are villages belonging to Ph√∫ Ninh District and N√∫i Th√†nh District. Resources Ph√∫ Ninh Lake water is the main source of water for residential and agricultural use in Tam K·ª≥ Town and other places in Ph√∫ Ninh and N√∫i Th√†nh districts. Lake Ph√∫ Ninh has hot mineral spring waters. Hydroelectric power from Lake Ph√∫ Ninh contributes up to 3 million kwh per year. Annually, about 80 tons of fish are taken from Ph√∫ Ninh Lake. Forest protection The total protective area surrounding Ph√∫ Ninh Lake is 23,409 ha, belonging to Ph√∫ Ninh and N√∫i Th√†nh District. According to the Qu·∫£ng Nam Forestry Bureau (in 2000), the area included 15,768 ha of forest including 1,500 ha of plantation forest. There is a great variety of animal and plant life, which are recorded in Vietnam's Red Data Book. It is the place to conserve hundred of plants and precious herbs with various zoology and plantation management systems. Ph√∫ Ninh Lake was recently awarded national historical heritage status. Topography The area is made up of low hills, average height 100‚Äì300 m, but some are 500‚Äì700 m above sea level. The average slope is 100 m, sloping to the west, south west and north east to form a small valley. To the south are mountain ranges with high peaks and sharp inclines which make this area strongly isolated. To the north and northwest are low mountains with easy slopes, creating many flat and large valleys surrounding Ph√∫ Ninh Lake. The soil is mostly yellow-red feralite soil on sandstone (comprising app. 61.11% of the total) which is easily eroded and not conducive to growing vegetables and crops. Red yellow feralite soil on igneous rock (app. 20%) is often covered by forest. Fertile soil makes up the remaining 15-17% and exists in valleys along the springs where the residential areas and fields are concentrated.

He served as Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1955 to 1961. Personal life Brentano was born in Offenbach am Main, the son of the Centre politician Otto von Brentano, a member of the 1919 Weimar National Assembly. The Brentano family, of Italian (Lombard) origin, had settled in the Landgraviate of Hesse- Darmstadt in the 17th century and were recognized as Hessian nobles, with close contact to important figures of the German Romanticism, including Goethe, Savigny and Arnim. He was related to famous German poets such as Clemens Brentano (1778‚Äì1842) and Bettina von Arnim (1785‚Äì1859). The author Bernard von Brentano (1901‚Äì1964) was his elder brother. Upon his Abitur degree in 1922, Heinrich von Brentano studied jurisprudence at the University of Munich and took his first and second Staatsexamen in 1925 and 1929. He received his doctorate from the University of Giessen and from 1932 worked as a lawyer in Darmstadt, from 1943 until 1945 as a prosecutor in Hanau. Brentano remained a bachelor throughout his life, living with his mother up to her death in 1948. In 1961, rumors circulated about his homosexuality, to which Adenauer drily replied: \\"He has not hit on me yet.\\"Schwule: Die rosa Normalit√§t; quote: \\"Bei mir hat er es noch nit versucht.\\"; Focus; 26 July 2004; retrieved on 19 November 2009. Brentano died of cancer at the age of 60. He was buried at Waldfriedhof Darmstadt. Political career Brentano (r.) with Adenauer at a 1957 CDU party conference After World War II, Brentano was one of the founders of the Christian Democratic Union in Hesse and became a member of the Landtag of Hesse in 1946, from 1947 as chairman of the parliamentary group. He also attended the proceedings of the Parlamentarischer Rat assembly drafting the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. In the federal elections of 1949, he obtained a seat in the West German Bundestag parliament by directly winning the mandate of the Bergstra√üe constituency. In 1952 he and other CDU MPs advocated the implementation of a plurality voting system instead of the personalized proportional representation concept, though to no avail. In the federal parliament, he served as head of the CDU/CSU faction from 1949 to 1955 and again from 1961 until his death. A member of the European Movement Germany, the European Common Assembly and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Brentano was an important figure in the foundation of the European Economic Community (EEC). After the Allied occupation statute had been lifted in 1955, he was appointed Foreign Minister of Germany at the suggestion of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who prior had filled the office himself. Brentano resigned when Adenauer had to form a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP) after the federal election of 1961 and had to accept the appointment of a FDP state secretary in the Foreign Office. He was succeeded by his party fellow Gerhard Schr√∂der.

He was the first Bishop of Memphis (1971-1982). Biography One of five children, Carroll Dozier was born in Richmond, Virginia, to Curtis Merry and Rosa Ann (n√©e Conaty) Dozier. After graduating from Benedictine High School in Richmond in 1928, he attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1932. He then furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical North American College and the Pontifical Gregorian University, there earning a Bachelor of Sacred Theology. He was ordained to the priesthood in Rome on March 19, 1937. Following his return to Virginia in 1937, Dozier served as a curate at St. Vincent's Church in Newport News until 1941, when he was transferred to St. Joseph's Church in Petersburg. He was diocesan director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith (1945-1953),then transferred to Sacred Heart Church in Danville until 1954 and afterwards pastor of Christ the King Church in Norfolk (1954-1971). He was named a Papal Chamberlain in 1954 and a Domestic Prelate in 1961. He spent a brief time at St. Victoria Parish in Hurt Virginia, dates unknown. On November 12, 1970, Dozier was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Memphis, Tennessee, by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on January 6, 1971 from Cardinal John Joseph Wright, with Archbishops Luigi Raimondi and Thomas Joseph McDonough serving as co-consecrators. During his tenure, Dozier implemented the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, including insisting on liturgical changes and giving more important roles to the laity in diocesan affairs. He also established the Diocesan Housing Corporation, Catholic Charities, Ministry to the Sick, and a weekly newspaper called Common Sense.

The two-part season premiere was first broadcast on Fox on September 21, 2009. The narrative follows series protagonist Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) as he overcomes his Vicodin addiction and psychological problems at Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital. Receiving season-high ratings, the episode garnered positive reviews from critics. The performance of Hugh Laurie was also applauded. Plot House awakens in the Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital after suffering through the painful effects of Vicodin withdrawal. He asks to leave knowing that they legally cannot keep him because he voluntarily committed himself. However, Dr. Nolan (Andre Braugher) refuses to sign a recommendation that he is able to return to practicing medicine. House resigns himself to staying at the hospital and getting his clearance. He meets his manic-depressive roommate, Alvie (Lin-Manuel Miranda), and begrudgingly participates in group therapy with Dr. Beasley. He also meets and is intrigued by Lydia (Franka Potente), a woman who plays piano for her sister-in-law Annie (Ana Lenchantin), an unresponsive patient in the ward who was a cellist. House attempts to be kicked out by making the patients' and workers' lives miserable, starting by humiliating the patients by deducing their problems during a group therapy session but only succeeds in being placed in solitary confinement. House then goads his fellow patients into creating havoc in the ward over not being allowed table tennis paddles, but Dr. Nolan calms them by giving them the paddles. From the hospital window, House sees Dr. Nolan get into a car with a woman. House convinces Alvie to break into Nolan's office to get information on him, but Alvie finds nothing useful. House then phones Wilson to ask for help blackmailing Nolan, but Wilson refuses, saying that Nolan had warned him that House may try to do something like this and that he should let Nolan do his job. House starts to adjust to life inside the institution. His only respite is Lydia's regular visits, during which they talk and discuss music. A new patient named Steve, who insists on the name \\"Freedom Master\\", believes he is a superhero that can fly. During one of his episodes, the doctors drug him into a catatonic state. House is infuriated by this, and, with Lydia's help, kidnaps Steve and takes him to a carnival. House and Steve go on a wind tunnel ride which makes it appear as if they are really flying. Steve is overjoyed, but then actually believes he can fly and jumps off a parking structure. With Steve badly injured, Dr. Nolan tells House he cannot possibly treat someone so uncooperative. As Nolan leaves, however, House softly calls him back and says, \\"I need help.\\" He begins therapy with Nolan and House says, \\"I want to get better.\\" House takes his medication for the first time, and tells Alvie that his new plan is to cooperate, much to the chagrin of Alvie, who feels betrayed. Nolan brings House a suit and has him mingle at the hospital's fund- raising party. His assignment is to make connections with strangers. It is difficult for House at first, but then he has fun toying with people. Lydia becomes his accomplice and before she leaves, she kisses House. House discusses the kiss with Nolan. Lydia is married. He also feels guilty about what happened to Steve, and Nolan tells him to apologize personally. During group therapy, Dr. Beasley suggests the patients put on a talent show. House has an idea of how to help Steve, who had been trying to \\"save\\" the silent girl, Annie, with a music box confiscated in the nurse's station. Steve calls it her \\"voicebox\\". House convinces Beasley to allow them to get the music box, but Dr. Nolan comes in to break up the group and wheels Steve away, saying that House was \\"trying to fix, instead of moving on\\". House rebuffs Lydia because he knows that, in the end, someone will get hurt. House is given a day pass by Dr. Nolan who requests his presence. He arrives at a hospital to find Nolan at the bedside of his dying father; a tearful Nolan asks House for a consultation. House has nothing to add to the diagnosis, confirming that Nolan Sr.'s condition is terminal. House accuses Nolan of having no one else to turn to but his own patient (House himself). Nolan tells House that he does not need him to make deductions, and House realizes that what he needs is company, so he stays and sits in silence. When House returns to Mayfield, he finds Lydia upset over her sister-in-law. He apologizes and dances with her. They find an empty room and have sex. The residents hold a talent show. House does not participate at first, but is coaxed into helping Alvie when he cannot finish his rap on stage. House apologizes to Steve, and as he wheels him away, Steve breaks his silence and gives the silent Annie the music box he was holding. For the first time, she speaks to say 'thank you'. Lydia arrives and House takes her in to see the group watching her sister-in-law playing \\"Bach's Cello Suite No. 1\\" on the cello. After learning that Annie is being released from Mayfield, House goes to Nolan's office to confront him. Dr. Nolan tells House that Lydia and her husband are taking Annie to a rehab facility in Arizona. House demands an overnight pass, and over Nolan's objections he goes to see Lydia at her home. He is startled when Lydia's young son answers the door. House wants her to stay, and Lydia says she wants to but ends up asking House to leave. Back in the Mayfield parking lot, House talks to Dr. Nolan about his feelings, which, in conjunction with House getting close enough to someone to be hurt in the first place, convinces him that House deserves the recommendation to the medical board, showing that he learned to talk about his problems instead of abusing Vicodin and deserves his medical license back. Mayfield gives House a good-bye party, and House is discharged and gets on a bus back to Princeton. After the departure of House, Alvie decides he wants to get better and goes back on his medication. Production Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital was used for exterior shots of the hospital.http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/07/house_television_show_returns.html Cultural references Several references to other depictions of psychiatric clinics are made, including: * House's walk into the building echoes Shock Corridor (1963) * Several scenes, including House wearing a knit cap during his visit to Nolan's office, are references to the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest directed by Milo≈° Forman. * Ward No. 6 is a reference to a short story of the same name. Reception The episode was well received by critics. Metacritic reported generally favorable reviews with a score of 77/100 based on 8 reviews.http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/houseseason6 The show earned a 9.5 rating out of 983 votes on TV.com. Entertainment Weekly stated \\"a trite, untrue mental-illness mystery insults the show's high IQ, but doesn't diminish the opener's capture-the-imagination thesis: that a redeemed House can be just as compelling as a rude House.\\" Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said \\"the episode has a few sentimentality issues (any plot point involving a music box walks a very fine line), but it doesn't matter much because the characters are so vivid they even outshine House at times, which can only be good for him.\\" Alan Sepinwall from The Newark Star-Ledger praised the episode saying \\"for one night, this is the best House, and its leading man, have been in a long time.\\" The episode also won for Best Episodic Drama at Writers Guild of America Awards 2009. Rating In its original broadcast, \\"Part One\\" was viewed by an estimated 16.5 million viewers, with \\"Part Two\\" bringing in approximately 17.25 million viewers. Compared to the rest of the sixth season, the episodes became the highest-rated in front of \\"Epic Fail\\", which received only 14.44 million viewers. The two-hour season premiere garnered the top Nielsen Ratings on the first night of the broadcast networks' premiere week. The show averaged a 6.7/16 with 17.1 million viewers. The rating was a significant rise from the previous year's season premiere, which averaged a 5.6/16 and 14.4 million viewers. 4.43 million Canadians watched this episode, making it the most viewed program of the week.

In the 1971 by-election, he campaigned against the amalgamation of St. Vital into the new \\"unicity\\" of Winnipeg. In 1973, he was supported by many Progressive Conservatives as the candidate most likely to defeat New Democratic Party incumbent Jim Walding. He narrowly lost to Walding on both occasions.

He presided over the trial of a prominent Hell's Angels member in 1993, and considered the question of whether a Winnipeg Sun reporter had a right to protect a confidential source.

This ruling was overturned on appeal.Kevin Rollason, \\"No jail for parking scofflaws\\", Winnipeg Free Press.

Its members are found in fresh and brackish waters of southern Europe, northern Africa, the wider Near East, the Aral and Caspian Seas, and rivers associated with these. Several species in the genus are threatened. Most species are fairly small to medium-sized cyprinids, but the genus also includes several members that can surpass in length and the largest, the mangar (L. esocinus) can reach . Systematics The type species is Luciobarbus esocinus, for which the genus was established by Heckel in 1843. The type species scientific name essentially means \\"pike-like pike-barbel\\" (after the northern pike, Esox lucius), though a more aliteral translation would be \\"pike-like wolf-barbel\\". Like many other cyprinids, the present genus was long included in Barbus. It appears to be a very close relative of the typical barbels - which include that genus type species, Barbus barbus -, and may well warrant inclusion in Barbus. Many modern authors prefer to consider it a subgenus instead. It is, moreover, not entirely clear what species to place in Luciobarbus if it is deemed valid. The IUCN argues for a rather inclusive circumscription. Nonwithstanding the taxonomy and systematics of this ill-defined assemblage, their closest living relative is probably Aulopyge huegelii.de Graaf et al. (2007), Almod√≥var et al.

Founding a company in the oil additive industry. Youth - Paola, Kansas Edward Ray Justice, Sr. was born June 12, 1921 in Paola, Kansas. Lawrence Milton \\"Zeke\\" Justice was born March 12, 1920 in Paola. James Russell \\"Gus\\" Justice was born July 16, 1916 in Paola. The Justice brothers were associated with cars and speed since the earliest years of their life. Growing up in Paola, Kansas, they started driving before they were teenagers. Their dad, Harry Milton Justice was an auctioneer in the Horse and Mule market. He would also auction farms and other large ticket possessions. Their mother, Anna Rule Justice was the more mechanically minded of their parents and where the boys were influenced with mechanics. They had three older sisters; Elma, Alberta and Marie. The first time the brothers did business together was when Ed and Zeke started a bike rental business at their home. The hung a sign on the tree in front of their house, \\"Justice brothers Bike Rentals\\". They had bought old bikes, some broken down and repaired and repainted them before putting them in their rental fleet. Two of the three brothers were involved in serious auto accidents in their youth. Gus was thrown from his Chevrolet after hitting another car that had pulled into a farm road intersection illegally. He was permanently paralyzed from this accident. Gus had to leave college due to his injuries. Zeke was involved in an auto accident with a truck in which one of the occupants of the car was killed. Gus bought a Cafe in Paola with the money that the townspeople had donated after his accident. Both Zeke and Ed worked at the Cafe for Gus. Ed would apply to and be accepted by Fry Aircraft School in Kansas City, Kansas. Zeke went to work at Western Auto in Kansas City. Pre War, Early years - California The lure of the car crazy culture of Southern California called and Ed Justice, Sr. responded by driving out on the famed Route 66 to his new home. The trip was paid for by his three passengers who paid $25 each and were allowed to bring anything that fit in a peck sack. Ed was able to convince his brother Zeke to leave his job at Western Auto in Kansas City by getting him a job with the legendary multi- millionaire Joel Thorne as part of his race shop fabrication crew. Thorne and his crew won the 1946 Indy 500 with George Robson as his driver. During his time there, Zeke met a young Frank Kurtis who had a rented space in the Thorne shop. Zeke would later become Frank's first employee when he formed Kurtis- Kraft after World War II. During his time at Thorne Engineering in Burbank, California, Zeke worked on a variety projects including the occasional side projects. Two interesting side projects were the modification of a car for a young Bill Pollack and the development of a three-wheel car under Frank Kurtis. Bill Pollack would later win the first grand prix at Pebble Beach in 1951. Bill also designed the road racecourse in Southern California known as Willow Springs. The three wheel car was sold to Gary Davis and became known as the Davis Motor Car Three Wheel, appearing on the cover of the August 1950 issue of Motor Trend magazine. War years Ed enlisted into the Army Air Corps during the beginning of World War II and served in the eighth airforce in Europe. Zeke suffered from Polio and was unable to serve in the military. He continued to work for Joel Thorne, whose shop was now making aircraft parts for the war effort. Gus Justice had been paralyzed in an automobile accident in Kansas at the age of 21 and was unable to serve in the military in World War II. Post World War II years After the war Ed joined Zeke at Kurtis- Kraft where they helped build many of the now legendary Kurtis-Kraft midget, Indy cars, and sports cars. During their time at Kurtis-Kraft, Ed and Zeke opened a separate shop in Glendale, California where they would do race car fabrication and repair. This was filling the need caused by the tremendous demand at the time and also Kurtis-Kraft's lack of time to address repairs due to the production of new cars. Kurtis-Kraft midgets were available in completed form or also in \\"kit\\" form. The Justice Brothers were hired by many to build \\"kit\\" cars for them, including Bill Vukovich, Loren Bennett, Jack Zimmermann and others. While at Kurtis-Kraft, Ed and Zeke installed the first Dzus fasteners on a race car while Frank was out of town on business. At first Frank was not happy with their change to his design, but later realize the benefit of using Dzus fasteners. The idea came from Ed's training as an aircraft mechanic. Ed had worked at Douglas Aircraft Flight Test in Santa Monica, California before the war and was an A&E.; The first race car with Dzus fasteners was \\"Bullet\\" Joe Garson's Kurtis-Kraft midget sponsored by Bowes Seal Fast and owned by famed race car driver Rex Mays. It was during their time at Kurtis-Kraft that Zeke met Chestein Wynn, a retired attorney who had received a formula from his son Clarence for an oil additive. The product grabbed Zeke's interest which caused him to share it with his brother Ed. They both were convinced that their future would be bright selling a product that no one had heard of on the opposite coast from where it was being made. Selling a midget that they built, they took the $2,500 profit and moved to Jacksonville, Florida. At the time they moved, Ed's wife was six months pregnant with their first child. Their distribution territory was Florida, Georgia and Cuba. Current The Justice brothers later relocated back to California.

He finished a distant third on the primary vote, with 22.8 percent behind former Liberal and Country League Premier Richard Layton Butler and Labor challenger Sydney McHugh. However, on the second count, almost 83 percent of his preferences flowed to McHugh, enough for McHugh to decisively defeat Butler with 56 percent of the two-party vote. Quirke later won the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Stanley, serving from 1941 to 1956 as a Labor member, He left Labor in 1956 and won the seat of Burra as an independent. He joined the LCL in 1963, continuing to hold Burra until he resigned from politics in 1968. Quirke and the other independent in the legislature, Tom Stott held the balance of power at the 1962 election. They both provided confidence and supply to the Playford Liberal and Country League (LCL) as a minority government in the hung parliament, allowing Playford to remain in power for what would be his final term. Stott became Speaker of the South Australian House of Assembly following the election. In 1963 Quirke ceased being an independent, joined the LCL, and served in the Playford LCL ministry in the portfolios of Irrigation, Lands, and Repatriation until the LCL lost government at the 1965 election.

It refers to the process of infusing vaccine-primed T lymphocytes into lymphodepleted recipients for the purpose of enhancing the proliferation and function of those T cells and increasing immune protection induced by that vaccine. The concept takes advantage of data from animal and studies in vaccinology and the homeostasis of T cells and has applications in the treatment of infectious disease, immunodeficiency syndromes, and cancer. Basic Immunology Vaccines Historically, the effect of vaccines -particularly against pathogens- has been assessed by measurement of their induction of a B-cell- mediated -or humoral- immune response, i.e. the production of pathogen- specific antibodies. In the study of both infectious diseases and cancer, a majority of potential immune targets are only expressed intra-cellularly, and are thus inaccessible to antibody-mediated elimination. T-cell mediated immunity, by contrast, has the potential to recognize targets expressed either extra- or intra-cellularly and has therefore been studied extensively for treatment of these diseases. A number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that vaccines against pathogens, bystander (non-pathogenic) proteins, tumor-associated antigens, or whole tumor cells, can induce specific T-cell mediated immune responses.Neelapu SS, Kwak LW, Kobrin CB, et al. Vaccine-induced tumor-specific immunity despite severe B-cell depletion in mantle cell lymphoma. Nat Med 2005;11(9):986-91.Biagi E, Rousseau R, Yvon E, et al.

Immunotherapy of high-risk acute leukemia with a recipient (autologous) vaccine expressing transgenic human CD40L and IL-2 after chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Blood 2006;107(4):1332-41. A number of approaches have been considered to amplify T cell mediated immune responses(e.g. IL-2, CTLA-4, IL-7, CD137), and some of these have shown clinical efficacy in eliminating particular types of cancer, most notably melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. T-Cell Homeostasis and Homeostatic Proliferation The use of immunotransplant to enhance T cell- mediated immune responses, derive from studies of T cell homeostasis. The total cohort of T cells in an organism maintain homeostasis ‚Äì a consistent total number of T cells in the peripheral blood. Transient elevations in peripheral blood T cell counts cause the whole population to diminish, transient depletions cause the whole population to proliferate, generally maintaining a roughly total T cell count. The latter situation ‚Äìlymphodepletion‚Äì has been studied extensively and the proliferation of mature T cells upon transfer into the lymphopenic host is referred to as ‚Äúlymphodepletion-induced‚Äù or ‚Äúhomeostatic‚Äù proliferation.Wrzesinski C, Restifo NP. Less is more: lymphodepletion followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant augments adoptive T-cell-based anti-tumor immunotherapy. Curr Opin Immunol 2005;17(2):195-201. It has been shown that homeostatic proliferation induces not only quantitative changes in T cell cohorts, but qualitative changes as well, such as increased function and the development of a memory- cell phenotype.Hamilton SE, Wolkers MC, Schoenberger SP, Jameson SC. The generation of protective memory-like CD8+ T cells during homeostatic proliferation requires CD4+ T cells. Nat Immunol 2006;7(5):475-81. The mechanism of these changes has been shown to be primarily due to upregulation of a group of cytokines including IL-7 and IL-15 induced by lymphodepletion. Additionally, lymphodepletion is a non-selective method of eliminating several known regulatory, or immunosuppressive, subsets of immune cells, such as regulatory T cells.Ghiringhelli F, Larmonier N, Schmitt E, et al. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells suppress tumor immunity but are sensitive to cyclophosphamide which allows immunotherapy of established tumors to be curative. Eur J Immunol 2004;34(2):336-44. Clinical Trials Of T-Cell Adoptive Transfer These observations have prompted several clinical studies of infusing pathogen- or tumor-specific T cells into lymphodepleted patients. A group at the National Cancer Institute demonstrated remarkable efficacy by infusing melanoma-specific T cells (obtained by growing tumor-infiltrating T cells ex vivo) into melanoma patients treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy. In a series of studies (to 2005) of this approach, up to 70% of treated patients were shown to have regressions of their tumors, many of which had been considerable in size and refractory to other therapies.Dudley ME, Wunderlich JR, Yang JC, et al. Adoptive cell transfer therapy following non- myeloablative but lymphodepleting chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with refractory metastatic melanoma. J Clin Oncol 2005;23(10):2346-57.Dudley ME, Yang JC, Sherry R, et al. Adoptive Cell Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma: Evaluation of Intensive Myeloablative Chemoradiation Preparative Regimens. J Clin Oncol 2008. These findings compare favorably with standard-of-care therapies for melanoma which generally lead to tumor regressions in only ~10-12% of patients. Pre-Clinical Studies And Clinical Trials Of Vaccine-Primed T-Cell Adoptive Transfer (I.E. Immunotransplant) Because of the logistic difficulty of obtaining tumor-specific T cells via the ex vivo expansion of tumor-infiltrating cells, a number of studies have examined inducing these cells in vivo by vaccination. Levitsky et al., at Johns Hopkins, in a series of pre-clinical studies demonstrated that vaccine- induced T cells could be considerably more effective when re-infused into lymphodepleted recipients.Borrello I, Sotomayor EM, Rattis FM, Cooke SK, Gu L, Levitsky HI. Sustaining the graft-versus-tumor effect through posttransplant immunization with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF)-producing tumor vaccines.

Blood 2008;111(4):2112-21. Subsequently, a clinical study in patients with multiple myeloma conducted by June et al., demonstrated that a standard vaccination against pneumonia could induce a T-cell-mediated response to the vaccine and that re-infusing these T cells after an extremely lymphodepletive therapy ‚Äìautologous stem cell transplant ‚Äì could significantly enhance that response.Rapoport AP, Stadtmauer EA, Aqui N, et al. Restoration of immunity in lymphopenic individuals with cancer by vaccination and adoptive T-cell transfer. Nat Med 2005;11(11):1230-7. To expand this immunotransplant concept to the amplification of anti-cancer immunity, researchers at Stanford University developed a pre-clinical lymphoma model using a in situ, CpG-base vaccineLi J, Song W, Czerwinski DK, et al. Lymphoma immunotherapy with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides requires TLR9 either in the host or in the tumor itself. J Immunol 2007;179(4):2493-500. to induce anti-tumor immunity and demonstrated that this immunity was enhanced 10-40 fold by immunotransplant.Brody JD, Goldstein MJ, Czerwinski DK, Levy R. Immunotransplantation preferentially expands T-effector cells over T-regulatory cells and cures large lymphoma tumors. Blood 2009;113(1):85-94. The above studies by Levitsky et al., were an important precedent for this work. In fact the Hopkins published preliminary results of a clinical study testing the basic immunotransplant concept in acute myeloid leukemia ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00116467 demonstrating encouraging signals of enhanced anti-tumor immunity.Borrello IM, Levitsky HI, Stock W, et al. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF)-secreting cellular immunotherapy in combination with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as postremission therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Blood 2009;114(9):1736-45. To continue the clinical translation of this approach, in August 2009 the Stanford group initiated a phase I/II clinical trial for patients with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma.ClinicalTrials.gov ID:NCT00490529 That study uses a whole-cell, CpG- activated, autologous tumor vaccine to induce anti-tumor immunity followed by leukapheresis and re-infusion of the vaccine-primed cells immediately after standard autologous transplant. Initial results of this study were presented at the ASCO 2011 Annual Meeting showing successful data towards the primary endpoint: amplification of anti-tumor T-cell responses. http://media.asco.org/player/flashplayer/player.aspx?LectureID=59241&conferenceFolder;=am2011&SessionFolder;=6619&configFile;=config_akamai.xml&IMISID;=67882&UserIP;=171.65.6.4&cs;=[vm_102_9_4106_59241__] See also *Vaccine *Immunology *T-Cell *CpG References Category:Immunology ","title":"Immunotransplant"},{"id":"24430673","text":"Ningjiang may refer to: *Ningjiang District, in Songyuan, Jilin, China *Ning River, in Guangdong, China ","title":"Ningjiang"},{"id":"24430676","text":"David E.

It was built in 1574 or a few years earlier by John William of Losenstein as a private Lutheran German grammar school in Lower Austria. According to the school statutes the school was for the youth of the nobility and non-nobility. John William also restored the nearby castle 'Schallaburg' and parish church in Loosdorf in renaissance style. The Hohe Schule has a small inner courtyard and is noted for its characteristic arcades and the rib vaults in the corridors. School Statutes Two original copies of the statutes of the school (in 16th century German: \\"die Lo√üdorffische Schulordnung\\"), which were printed in Augsburg in 1574, are still left.In 1974 a facsimily of the school statutes was issued in Loosdorf. The statutes resemble those of the Lutheran grammar school of Strasbourg (the predecessor of the University of Strasbourg). Some parts on school rules and punishments even are literally the same, but they do differ on some points.Helene Miklas, Dissertation, p. 206 However, unlike many school statutes in 16th century Germany these statutes are not a mere copy of other statutes, but relatively original. The role of the Hohe Schule in the context of (contra)reformation at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century in Europe has been documented by the University of Vienna.See also Helene Miklas: Die protestantische \\"Hohe Schule\\" in Loosdorf 1574‚Äì1627. Meilenstein auf dem Weg der reformatorischen P√§dagogik in √ñsterreich oder eine blo√üe Episode? In: Paedagogica Historica. International journal of the history of education. New Series 37. 2001. S. 758-760. According to the statutes the education was adapted to the talents of the students. Pupils could start from the age of 4 to 6, which was relatively young, as the Landschaftsschule of Linz did not accept pupils under the age of six. In the Loosdorfian school the pupils would learn to read, write and speak both German and Latin, music, religion, mathematics and a few other subjects. Provincial School In 1592 it got the status of Landschaftsschule, that meant a school for the nobility of Lower Austria with subsidy from the estates of the knights and the lords of Lower Austria. The reason for that was that the then mainly Protestant lords and knight of the parliament of Lower Austria wanted a replacement for the short lived Landschaftsschule of Vienna that had been closed a few years earlier by the emperor. In 1591 they decided not to build a new Landschaftsschule school, but to support existing schools instead. They granted an annual subsidy of five hundred or six hundred guilders and after a school inspection in 1592 that was raised to one thousand guilders, but from 1607 on that probably gradually got less as the subsidy for the other Protestant Landschaftsschule in Horn in that year also was diminished from one thousand to five hundred guilders.Helene Miklas, Dissertation p. 319 In 1601 John William of Losenstein died. His sarcophagus was placed in the parish church of Loosdorf.Nowadays the sarcophagus of John William of Losenstein can be seen in the Castle Museum Schallaburg. On his tomb it can be read that he founded the Hohe Schule and that posterity should enjoy the school. George Christoph of Losensteinleithen inherited the castle Schallaburg to which the school belonged, but also the debts that had amounted to one hundred and twenty thousand guilders. In 1614 George Christoph of Stubenberg in Styria, his father-in-law, took over all his possessions and paid out the creditors.G. Flossmann in Renaissance Schloss Schallaburg - ein Kunstwerk, pp.24-25, Vienna, 1989, In the 17th century the Protestant religion came under pressure in Lower Austria. The Protestants lost the majority in the states of Lower Austria. The school faced financial problems, because less students came to the school and the subsidy from the states of Lower Austria was reduced to 500 guilders per year. The school could stay open for a few years by aid of George Christoph of Stubenberg, but the states of Lower Austria refused to guarantee that they would pay the Stubenberg family back. Autumn 1619 Protestant noblemen from Upper Austria besieged the Abbey of Melk. Imperial troops made an end to that siege and plundered castle Schallaburg and other Protestant castles nearby. Loosdorf and the Hohe Schule were plundered as well. Finally the school had to close in 1627 as a result of an decree issued by emperor Ferdinand II that banned Protestant preachers and teachers from the Archduchy of Austria. The owner of the Schallaburg however secretly kept a Protestant preacher on his castle despite of this decree. Teachers and Students of the School Because of the plundering in autumn 1619 and in later wars little is known about the teachers and students the school.During the Napoleontic wars the Schallaburg also was plundered and the entire archive of the Schallaburg also was lost after the Soviet occupation of Lower Austria following the second world war. (H. Miklas, Dissertation, p. 291) It is estimated that the school in 1593 had about seven teachers and about 150 students. A known teacher of the school was music teacher Daniel Lackner. Vicar Balthasar Masco possibly also gave lessons. He probably played a role in formulating the school statutes. He certainly was one of the inspectors of some school inspections. After two earthquakes in 1590 Masco wrote a small work about earlier earthquakes from the antiquity until 1590, called Erdbidems Spiegel or Speculum terrae motusLater in the work called \\"Speculum terrae motuum\\". (\\"Mirror of the Earth[quakes]\\", printed in Nuremberg in 1591).H. Miklas, Dissertation, p. 394 In the subtitle he wrote that earthquakes are God's wrath and punishments.The words on the first page are: \\"Speculum terrae motus, Das ist: Erdbidems Spiegel.

The Building after School Closure After the school closure in 1627 the building until 1809 served as a private residence for different families of the Austrian gentry.Schweickhardt, \\"Darstellung des Erzherzogtums √ñsterreich unter der Enns\\" (e-book in the Gothic script Fraktur, e-book page n595), 1837, Vienna, VOW, book 8, pages 201-212The main source for Schweickhardt's story on the Hohe Schule was an article written by professor Ignaz Franz Keiblinger in Archiv f√ºr Geschichte, Statistik, Literatur und Kunst, August 13, 15 and 17, 1827 (e-book in the Gothic script Fraktur), Nr. 97-99, pp 529-541, \\"Loosdorf in √ñsterreich unter der Enns und das einst bestandene protestantische Gymnasium daselbst\\". Ignaz Keiblinger (1797-1869) was a teacher and librarian at the abbey of Melk. After 1809 the building was sold to plain citizens. In the 19th century little shops were opened close to the little court. The second floor served as private living space. In the 1980s the building was in a bad condition. In the 1980s the street side of the property was renovated. The shops on the street side were turned into two apartments. Later at the front side of the building two other apartments were created. From 1996 until 2017 the apartments, courtyard and entrance gradually was painted and other changes were made. The house is divided in about ten apartments. In 1996, 2011, 2014 and 2017 the house changed owners.

While the turmoils Bronze Age collapse that separate the Late Bronze Age from the Early Iron Age are well documented, theories of migration during the Middle Bronze Age (20th century BCE) have little direct support. Theories Various outdated theories have postulated waves of migration during the Middle Bronze Age in the Ancient Near East. Mellaart (1958) According to Mellaart, in The End of the Early Bronze Age in Anatolia and the Aegean (1958), for reasons unknown, the Hittites moved into central Asia Minor, conquering the Hattians and later adopting their culture and name. This invasion by the Hittites displaced other peoples living in Anatolia, who in turn displaced the Middle Helladic Greek- speaking peoples to the west. This in turn caused an exodus from Northwestern Anatolia andcreated a wave of refugees who invaded what is now southern Greece and destroyed the Early Helladic civilization. Yet, more recent theories and evidence suggest that a Proto-Indo-Hittite language dates back to the fourth millennium BCE, prior to the Bronze Age.. According to Mellaart, archaeological evidence shows that the cities of Erzerum, Sivas, Pulur Huyuk near Baiburt, Kultepe near Hafik, and Maltepe near Sivas were destroyed during the Middle Bronze Age. The great trading city of Kanesh (Level II) was also destroyed. From there in the hill country between Halys the destruction layers from this time tell the same story. Karaoglan, Bitik, Polatli and Gordion were burnt, as well as Etiyokusu and Cerkes. Further west near the Dardanelles the two large mounds of Korpruoren and Tavsanli, west of Kutahya, show the same signs of being destroyed. The destruction even crossed into Europe in what is now Bulgaria. The migration brought an end to Bulgaria's Early Bronze Age, with archaeological evidence showing that the Yunacite, Salcutza, and Esero centers had a sudden mass desertion during this time. From the Dardanelles, the refugee invaders moved into mainland Greece, and the Peloponnese saw burnt and abandoned cities on par with the much later Dorian invasion which destroyed the Mycenaean civilization. At this time, 1900 BC, destruction layers can be found at southern Greek sites like Orchomenos, , Hagios Kosmas, Raphina, Apesokari, Korakou, Zygouries, Tiryns, Asine, Malthi and Asea. Many other sites are deserted, e.g. Yiriza, Synoro, Ayios Gerasimos, Kophovouni, Makrovouni, Palaiopyrgos, etc. This destruction across Greece also coincided with the arrival of a new culture that had no connection with the Early Helladic civilization, who were the original inhabitants. Northern Greece escaped destruction, as well as southern Anatolia, which during this time showed no disturbances. Minyan ware Gray Minyan ware was first identified as the pottery introduced by this mass movement of new populations into southern Greece around 1900 BC. However, this theory was disproved in the 1950s when excavations at Lerna showed that Minyan ware had a predecessor in the preceding Early Helladic III Tiryns culture.; ; . The advent of Minyan ware coincides with domestic processes reflective of the smooth transition from Early to Middle Bronze Age culture. Genetic research Lazaridis et al. (2017) researched the genetical origins of the Greeks. They found that the ancient Mycenaean and Minoan populations were highly similar, but not identical, and that \\"the Minoans and Mycenaeans descended mainly from early Neolithic farmers, likely migrating thousands of years prior to the Bronze Age from Anatolia, in what is today modern Turkey.\\" According to Lazaridis, \\"Minoans, Mycenaeans, and modern Greeks also had some ancestry related to the ancient people of the Caucasus, Armenia, and Iran. This finding suggests that some migration occurred in the Aegean and southwestern Anatolia from further east after the time of the earliest farmers.\\"Phys.org, Ancient DNA analysis reveals Minoan and Mycenaean origins Lazaridis et al. (2017) further state that \\"the Mycenaeans differed from Minoans in deriving additional ancestry from an ultimate source related to the hunter‚Äìgatherers of eastern Europe and Siberia, introduced via a proximal source related to the inhabitants of either the Eurasian steppe or Armenia.\\" See also * Bronze Age Greece * Bronze Age Anatolia References Sources ;Printed sources    .  * ;Web-sources Category:2nd millennium BC Category:Bronze Age Anatolia Category:Human migration Category:Indo-European history Category:Helladic civilization Category:Cycladic civilization Category:Minoan civilization ","title":"Middle Bronze Age migrations (Ancient Near East)"},{"id":"24430690","text":"Wanee Festival was an annual event held 2005 - 2018 at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park, in Live Oak, Florida.Festival The festival was hosted by the Allman Brothers Band until 2014 and was managed by Live Nation. On November 5th, 2018 it was announced via the Wanee website that the festival would not be occurring at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in 2019, citing the religious holidays of Easter and Passover as the reason the festival was cancelled. No plans for future Wanee Festivals have been announced.  Overview  The festival, hosted by the Allman Brothers Band until 2014 and managed by Live Nation, is held outdoors on two stages (Peach Stage & Mushroom Stage). In later years, The Porch Stage, The Traveling Stage and The Campground Stage have been added and are frequently used now. The Wanee Festival has featured as little as 11 bands/artists its inaugural year to as many as 44 bands/artists in 2011. In recent years, the Wanee Festival has gone from a two-day- to a three-day-long festival. Even though the official festival is only three days long, many festival goers arrive early for the Wanee Kickoff Party, known as Wanee Wednesday, which features less well known artists and is typically the night before the opening day of the festival. The event is generally held in the spring. In addition to the headlining Allman Brothers Band, the festival has featured performances by band members with their own bands, including The Derek Trucks Band, Oteil (Burbridge) and the Peacemakers and Gov't Mule (Warren Haynes). Other guests have included DJ Logic, Big Gigantic, Galactic, Hot Tuna, Lotus, Stephen Marley, Grateful Dead Alumni Bob Weir and Ratdog, Widespread Panic, Stephen Stills, the Black Keys, Junior Brown, Griffin Anthony, The Doobie Brothers, Buddy Guy, Furthur, JJ Grey & Mofro, Little Feat and Zappa Plays Zappa.

This silting rate is considered quite low, compared to other reservoirs on the Yellow River, such as the narrow Yanguoxia Reservoir just downstream, which lost 71.3% of its storage capacity between 1958 and 1964 (and 77%, by 1965), or Sanmenxia Reservoir, which lost 96% of its storage capacity to sedimentation in just 4 years. A ferry on the Liujiaxia Reservoir The reservoir usually does not freeze over in winter, but during the unusually cold weather in early 2008 over half of its surface froze, which necessitated taking measures to protect the turbines of the hydroelectric plant from floating ice.La centrale hydro√©lectrique de Liujiaxia prend activement des mesures pour assurer la production √©lectrique en cas de gel, People's Daily, 28.02.2008. A variety of watercraft operate on the reservoir. Vehicle ferries run frequently across the reservoir between docks in Linxia County (Lianhua Tai) and Yongjing County, providing a shorter and more pleasant route for travel between Linxia City and Liujiaxia Town than China National Highway 213 does.

Crossing of Passaic River The New York and Greenwood Lake Railway was a shortline railroad owned by James Wilson and based in Passaic, New Jersey. It operated primarily to service transfer station facilities for a few private companies, with a trans-load facility at its yard in Passaic. Cars ran on NYGL's trackage, the former Erie Railroad Dundee spur, to interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway on New Jersey Transit's Bergen County Line in Garfield. Former owner Conrail slated the Dundee spur to close in 1996, but customer Atlantic Coast Fibers protested. As a result, Conrail sold the line. The transfer facility also serviced Phill-Con Services' construction debris receiving facility. Phill-Con used the Greenwood shed as a waste transfer station for shipment to Alabama from May 2005 through early 2009. That station became unprofitable with the downturn in constructions and the opening of the nearby Kearny landfill in January 2009, undercutting Phill-Con's disposal fees by $20 per ton. The shortline's name was taken from an earlier unrelated New York and Greenwood Lake Railway that merged into the Erie Railroad in 1943. The NY&GL; suspended operations in 2012, when its last customer ceased operations. The railroad had various equipment, including locomotives NYGL 1267(GP9) and 1268(GP7), as well as Erie 436(SW9), EL 3372(U34CH) and former- LIRR 616 Alco FA-1 stored in Passaic, NJ. In 2015, the 3372 was moved to Boonton, NJ for restoration by URHS, and the 436 has been moved to Ringoes, NJ for excursion service on the BR&W.; They also have several passenger coaches and locomotives NYGL 935 and Erie 833 stored in Port Jervis, NY. The equipment stored in Port Jervis was slated to be used for a planned passenger excursion service along the scenic upper Delaware River, which failed to materialize. The passenger coaches have been heavily vandalized, but the 2 locomotives have stayed in relatively good shape. In 2014, the Erie 833 was cosmetically touched up, and moved to Spencer, North Carolina by Norfolk Southern, for the \\"Streamliners in Spencer\\" event, and then returned to Port Jervis shortly thereafter. Decline and Abandonment On September 13, 2007, the property of the railroad was seized by the IRS for unpaid taxes, and sold for $565,000 to Passaic Street Properties, LLC, a non-carrier, who thereby acquired the rights to operate the line. On May 1, 2018, the company filed a Notice of Exemption to abandon the line and develop the property, including some portion of it as a city park. In addition to the exemption, the town of Garfield and Passaic cut portion of the spur at the Dundee-Bergen line connection, making the line out of service and isolated from shipments during possible reactivation. STB Verified Notice of Exemption On June 10, 2019, the railway formerly petitioned for abandonment, citing negotiations with the future property owner, effectively permanently ending operation of the spur.STB Abandonment Exemption https://www.northjersey.com/videos/news/passaic/passaic- city/2020/02/19/trains-passaic-almost-ready-roll-homeless-debris-being- removed/4807997002/ retrieved Feb 27 2020. publication February 19 2020 All equipment was removed on February 28, 2020.

He was a farmer and led a black self-defense organization. He was notable as a principal figure in the Christiana incident (or riot), 1851, also known as the Christiana Resistance. Edward Gorsuch, a Maryland slaveowner who owned four slaves who had fled over the state border to Parker's farm, was killed and other white men in the party to capture the fugitives were wounded. The events brought national attention to the challenges of enforcing the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Upon Gorsuch's death, Parker fled the area traveling by the Underground Railroad to Rochester, New York, where he met with Frederick Douglass. Douglass arranged for Parker and his party to take a ferry across the Niagara River to Canada, where they gained freedom. Settling in Buxton, Parker learned to read and write, and became a correspondent for Douglass's North Star newspaper. Forty-one men were indicted in the Christiana case, mostly on charges of treason for trying to thwart the Fugitive Slave Law. Hanway, a white man, was tried in the US District Court in Philadelphia, Judge John K. Kane presiding. After he was acquitted by the jury in 15 minutes, the US Attorney's office decided against trying others. Frederick Douglass in his autobiography discusses several incidents of resistance to the Fugitive Slave Law. He ranked the events at Christiana that, \\"more than all else, destroyed the fugitive slave law\\".Frederick Douglass, The Essential Frederick Douglass, Wilder Publications, 2008, p. 434. Ten years before the Civil War, the events in Christiana generated the following headlines, \\"Civil War, The First Blow Struck\\",Thomas P. Slaughter, Bloody Dawn - The Christiana Riot and Racial Violence in the Antebellum North, Oxford University Press, 1991, p. ix. foreshadowing events to come and highlighting the historical significance of the event. William Parker was renowned in the area for his activism against slavery, and his bravery in the protection of his and other blacks' civil and political rights. He assisted many runaway slaves and was one of many people in the area involved in the Underground Railroad. His boldness and leadership in the resistance at his house in Christiana inspired people in the neighborhood. For years the events of the resistance there had been largely attributed to the leadership of white Quakers. But accounts reported they were there in support of their black neighbors and were not openly engaged in the resistance. Early life William Parker was born into slavery on Roedown Plantation in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, to Louisa Simms, an enslaved woman. His father was likely a white man, as Parker was of mixed race.William Parker, \\"The Freedman's Story - Parts I and II\\", Atlantic Monthly, Vol. XVII, February/March 1866, p. 153. His mother died when Parker was very young. In his memoir and slave narrative, The Freedman's Story,The Freedman's Story Parker later wrote that he learned how to fight as a young boy to gain a spot by the warmth of the fire. He dreamed of being free, especially to avoid the regular sale and separation of family members and loved ones. Parker likened the experience of such sales to death and a funeral, as loved ones were usually never seen again. He was approximately seventeen when he ran away to seek his freedom. Freedom Parker eventually reached the free state of Pennsylvania, where he settled in Christiana in Lancaster County. He met and married Eliza Ann Elizabeth Howard. Abolitionist and self defense After being inspired by speeches by William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass, Parker encouraged the formation of a mutual protection society of members from the black community.William Parker, \\"The Freedman's Story - Part I\\", Atlantic Monthly, Vol. XVII, February 1866, p. 161. Christiana was not far from the Maryland border. Slave catchers, including the infamous Gap Gang (see Gap, Pennsylvania), came into the area seeking fugitive slaves to return to their slaveholders. They were paid lucrative bounties for their services; they also often kidnapped free blacks to sell into slavery, as demand was so high for slaves in the Deep South that slave catchers were willing to take the risk. Parker and other members of the mutual protection society used force to prevent the recapture of blacks in the area. They developed an intelligence network to send alerts so that their neighbors would know when slave catchers were about; they would quickly spring into action to retrieve any captives before they could be taken back across state lines. If the laws of the country would not protect them, their family, friends and neighbors, then they would protect themselves. Christiana Resistance (earlier known as the Christiana Riot) Line drawing of William Parker's house, circa 1851. On September 11, 1851, a slaveholder from Maryland (Edward Gorsuch) came bearing a warrant to recover his slaves. Gorsuch had information that his slaves were at Parker's farmhouse. Parker had received intelligence that Gorsuch, a federal marshal and others were on their way to his farmhouse. So when Gorsuch arrived, Parker and his fellow defenders were prepared. Eliza, Parker's wife, sounded a horn alerting neighbors that slave catchers were out and that help was needed. Both sides were resolute in their determination to prevail: Parker convinced of the immorality of slavery, and Gorsuch confident in the law and his right to own slaves. There are conflicting stories of why and how the shooting started, but it resulted in the death of Gorsuch and severe wounding of his son Dickinson. William Parker went into hiding that evening. Using connections on the Underground Railroad to evade federal arrest, he made his way to Rochester, New York. Noted abolitionist and leader Frederick Douglass assisted his passage into Canada by ferry across the Niagara River. He, his wife Eliza, and their three children eventually settled in a black community in Buxton, Ontario, where they purchased a lot of land. They had more children in Canada. A federal grand jury indicted 41 men in the events (including Parker in absentia). Believing that a former slave was not the leader, they first tried Castner Hanway, a white neighbor of Parker. He was acquitted by the jury after 15 minutes of deliberation. The Christiana Resistance was a major sore point for slavery proponents in the years leading up to the Civil War. Life in Canada Parker continued his activism against slavery from his new home in Canada. He turned his attention to acquiring new skills in the fight to gain freedom and improve the race. He attended school in Buxton to become literate. Shortly thereafter he became the Kent County correspondent for the North Star, Frederick Douglass's newspaper published in Rochester, New York. It promoted freedom, and the intellectual and moral improvement of blacks. Parker was also elected to and wrote many communications for the Court of Arbitration (the governing body of the Buxton settlement, a self-governed community). He was elected to the Raleigh Township Council from Buxton, and was repeatedly re- elected by both white and black voters.Victor Ullman, Look to the North Star - A Life of William King, Toronto: Umbrella Press, 1969, pp. 170-173.

Starting with a user-specified bounding box around the object to be segmented, the algorithm estimates the color distribution of the target object and that of the background using a Gaussian mixture model. This is used to construct a Markov random field over the pixel labels, with an energy function that prefers connected regions having the same label, and running a graph cut based optimization to infer their values. As this estimate is likely to be more accurate than the original, taken from the bounding box, this two-step procedure is repeated until convergence. Estimates can be further corrected by the user by pointing out misclassified regions and rerunning the optimization. The method also corrects the results to preserve edges.

Each century or generation is known as a Tabaqah, the plural of which is Tabaqat. The Tabaqat writings depict the past of a particular tradition of religious affiliation or scholarship and follows a chronological parameter that stretch from an authoritative starting-point to the generation (tabaqa) immediately preceding the assumed author.  Development  The tabaqat literature originated sometime within the late eighth and ninth centuries. Another account also cited that the tabaqat format became popular during the period of early hadith transmitter critics, emerging amid the effort to identify, classify, and evaluate transmitters in the discipline known as ilm al-rijƒÅl. The Tabaqat literature were written as tools to assist the muhaddiths in their efforts to classify hadith transmitters and to determine the quality of particular isnads. The isnad as a system for authenticating the memory of the prophetic period required righteous, honest, and competent transmitters in every generation. Biographical entries in the Tabaqat literature typically offer evaluations of the personal, religious and intellectual quality of their subjects.  Examples  Famous examples of Tabaqat literature include Tabaqat al-Hanabilah originally by Ibn Abi Ya'la and then by Ibn Rajab. Tabaqat ul-Mutazilah (as the title suggests, concerned with Islamic theologians of the Mutazilite school) by Ahmad bin Yahya al- Murtada, at-Tabaqat ul-Kubra (about the companions of the Prophet and their successors) by Ibn Sa'd and - more recently - Tabaqat 'Alam ul-Shi'ah (about famous Shi'a scholars] by Aqa Buzurg Tehrani. The case of Ibrahim Hafsi's compendium of works, which are based on the Tabaqat historiographical framework, also demonstrate how the genre is applied in various fields in the Arabo-Islamic civilization and religious disciplines.

Fifty-seven students graduated from the school between 1954 and 1968. The 2000 Florida Legislature unanimously passed legislation establishing a College of Law for Florida A&M; University to be located in Orlando and on June 14, 2000, Governor Jeb Bush signed the bill into law. The legislation included three conditions: the school was required to serve \\"historically underrepresented communities\\"; it had to open by 2003; and it had to earn ABA accreditation within five years. The College of Law admitted its first class in 2002. The American Bar Association (ABA) granted the Florida A&M; University College of Law provisional approval in August 2004, which allowed its first graduates to take the bar exam while the law school continued to work toward meeting ABA standards. LeRoy Pernell, who was dean of the law school at Northern Illinois University, was recruited as the new dean in 2007. He fired a number of faculty and recruited 19 new faculty members. Under Pernell, the law school created its Center for International Law and Justice, and became the only historically black college accepted into the International Association of Law Schools. Full ABA accreditation was achieved in July 2009. Today, the College of Law occupies its own building at 201 Beggs Avenue in downtown Orlando. The four-story building was designed by Rhodes+Brito Architects of Orlando. The College of Law has an onsite law library that is open to the public. The new building opened to students in 2005. Of the 1,807 who applied to the school in 2009, 630 were accepted and 234 enrolled. Seventy-seven percent of the entering class were Florida residents, and 42% were white students.  Rankings  Florida A&M; University College of Law is ranked #146-192 (bottom quartile) by U.S. News and World Report.  Employment and bar passage  According to Florida A&M;'s 2016 ABA-required disclosures, 34.7% of the Class of 2015 obtained full-time, long-term, bar passage required employment ten months after graduation, excluding solo practitioners. Of the Florida A&M; Law alumni who took the Florida bar exam for the first time in July 2019, 61.1% passed. On May 15, 2020, the council of the American Bar Association‚Äôs Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar met remotely and determined this school and nine others had significant noncompliance with Standard 316. This Standard was revised in 2019 to provide that at least 75% of an accredited law school‚Äôs graduates who took a bar exam must pass one within two years of graduation. The school has been asked to submit a report by Feb. 1, 2021; and, if the council does not find the report demonstrates compliance, the school will be asked to appear before the council at its May, 2021 meeting.  Costs  The cost of tuition at Florida A&M; for the 2016‚Äì2017 academic year is $14,131.66 (Residents) and $34,034.59 (Non-Residents) for their full-time day program. The part-time evening program's tuition is $10,028.92 (Residents)and $24,153.58 (Non-Residents). According to Law School Transparency, an in-state student who uses student loans to finance their entire cost of attendance (tuition, fees, living expenses, etc.) will graduate from Florida A&M; with $147,411 in student loan debt, including interest. An out of state student who uses student loans to finance their entire cost of attendance will leave Florida A&M; College of Law with approximately $218,834 in student loan debt, including interest. Approximately 79.2% of students pay full sticker price, meaning they do not receive a scholarship or other grant aid.  Law Library  Florida A&M; University College of Law has an onsite law library that is open to the public. \\"The primary mission of the Florida A&M; University College of Law Library is to enhance study, learning, research, and service conducted at the College of Law by providing present and future resources and services to meet the informational needs of its faculty, students, and staff. The secondary mission of the Law Library is to contribute a valuable community service by providing public access of its collections to the local legal community and to the general public.\\"  References   External links  * Category:ABA-accredited law schools in Florida Category:Educational institutions established in 1949 Category:Florida A&M; University Category:1949 establishments in Florida Category:Historically black universities and colleges in the United States Category:Universities and colleges in Orange County, Florida Category:Historically black law schools ","title":"Florida A&amp;M University College of Law"},{"id":"24431085","text":"250px Bhopal ‚Äì Bilaspur Express speeding 73 km/h between Bina Junction and Khurai Railway Station The Bhopal‚ÄìBilaspur Express/Passenger, is an express passenger train service running between Bhopal Junction railway station of Bhopal City, the capital city of Madhya Pradesh and Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh (formerly in Madhya Pradesh.)

Birrguu Matya is marketed as belonging to the cultural history of the Wiradjuri People who are considered the first inhabitants of the Bathurst district and have been living there for at least 40,000 years. The name Birrguu Matya seems to be attributable to words from two discontiguous languages, Wiradjuri, spoken in southern New South Wales and Paakanytji, spoken in north-west New South Wales. It appears that the words birrguu (Wiradjuri, meaning bush) and matya (Paakanytji, meaning game or bold) were taken from Macquarie Aboriginal Words, published in 1994, only a few years prior to the game being released as a commercial product.http://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2011/07/birrguu-matya-or-the-game- tapatan/ The game can be said to be a simplified Chess and a slightly more strategic Tic-tac-toe or naughts and crosses.  Object & Rules of Birrguu Matya  The object of the game is to get your three stones in a row before your opponent. You can win diagonally, vertically or horizontally. Starting with an empty cloth, each player takes turns placing down one of their stones. Both players are simultaneously complete their line of three while blocking their opponent. Phase two of the game begins when all the pieces are laid done and no one has positioned three in a row. At this stage, players take turns moving their stones one square at a time in any direction, provided the square is vacant. You cannot skip a move and you cannot lift a stone and jump. While the game is similar in strategy to other ancient games, its marketers claim it to be a rarely occurring \\"table game\\", not generally found in Australian indigenous culture. This claim is questionable given that no Australian antecedents of the game have been documented.http://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2011/07/birrguu-matya-or-the-game- tapatan/  References  Category:Australian Aboriginal culture Category:Outdoor games ","title":"Birrguu Matya"},{"id":"24431125","text":"Falling in Love with Jazz is an album by jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins, released on the Milestone label in 1989, featuring performances by Rollins with Clifton Anderson, Bob Cranshaw, Mark Soskin, Jerome Harris and Jack DeJohnette with Branford Marsalis, Tommy Flanagan, and Jeff Watts standing in on two tracks.Sonny Rollins discography accessed 22 September 2009 Reception The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow calls the album an \\"average effort from Sonny Rollins and his regular sextet\\".

He is most remembered for his provocative April 1966 cover story for which the magazine's cover simply asked, \\"Is God Dead?\\" Biography Early years Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Elson was the son of Robert T. Elson, a newspaper reporter who became an editor at Time and Life. He attended St. Anselm's Abbey School (then known as the Priory School) in Washington, D.C. and received an undergraduate degree from Notre Dame in 1953. He also received a master's degree in English from Columbia University in 1954. Elson served in the U.S. Air Force in the 1950s and later became a reporter for the Canadian Press news agency. He was hired at Time and worked initially in the Detroit bureau. He remained at Time in 1987 and eventually held the position of assistant managing editor. 1966 cover story: \\"Is God Dead?\\" He was the religion editor at Time magazine who famously asked, \\"Is God Dead?\\" Elson posed the questions in a cover story for the April 8, 1966 issue of Time. For the first time in the magazine's 43-year history, the cover featured no photograph or illustration. Instead, the cover showed blood-red letters against a black background posing Elson's question, \\"Is God Dead?\\" The New York Times has called the cover \\"a signpost of the 1960s, testimony to the wrenching social changes transforming the United States.\\" Though Elson is most remembered for the \\"Is God Dead?\\" cover, it was one of many stories he wrote for the publication on the subject of religion. Indeed, he had written nine previous cover stories on religious issues for Time. Reaction to the story Elson's cover story provoked extensive discussion. The issue drew Time's biggest newsstand sales in more than 20 years. The publisher received 3,500 letters‚Äîthe most in the magazine's history to that point. The Chicago Sun Times referred to it as \\"a debate that had shocked and confused millions of devout Americans.\\" One syndicated columnist, Jim Bishop, responded angrily to the article, pointing out that a recent Harris Poll showed that 97% of all American claim to believe in God. Bishop suggested the editors at Time had an incorrect view of God: \\"I would guess that the editors think that, if God is still out there, He should alter His image a little, become a hipster, stop dragging His sandals and start snapping His fingers in a Go-Go world.\\" In a May 1966 address, the pastor of the National Presbyterian Church of Washington disputed the \\"God is Dead\\" theory, saying advocating the theory were a small group that had plunged \\"into the depths of existential despair.\\" The pastor further noted, \\"One is moved to ask whether the reporters were sufficiently well acquainted with the deceased as to be able to identify the corpse.\\" Death On September 7, 2009, Elson died at home in Manhattan.

Learning in this sense means that an active process of knowledge creation is taking place within social interactions, but outside of formal learning environments or training facilities. This process can be facilitated by well-designed and structured systems and by supporting ways of communication and collaboration, like the Microtraining method does. A Microtraining arrangement comprises a time span of 15‚Äì20 minutes for each learning session, which can activate and maintain learning processes for a longer period if bundled into series. A Microtraining session can be held face-to-face, online or embedded in an e-learning scenario. Applicability The Microtraining method can be applied to learning situations within organizations and companies, especially when basic knowledge needs to be refreshed or improved and when information is needed for immediate use in daily practice. In comparison to formal learning, Microtraining is an approach aimed at structuring informal learning activities. While formal learning may be a successful approach for people with less knowledge and skills [Tynj√§l√§, 2008], it can be counter-productive for more experienced employees [Jonassen et al., 1993] for whom informal blended learning approaches like Microtraining appear to be working very well [Jonassen/Mayes/McAleese, 1993; Jonassen, 1997]. Organizational requirements With regard to organizational requirements, facilitating the new learning concept by management and accompanying the initial phase of implementing the Microtraining method are crucial for its success. Consequently, the Microtraining method is not meant to be an approach to designing learning materials alone, but involves analyzing learning processes in organizations and supporting change management of learning strategies as a whole. If, for example, employees have insufficient access to a computer or web services supporting online learning activities that are part of the Microtraining approach or if they are not allowed to spend working time learning, any effort to design the best material and collaborative surroundings will fail. Didactical principles The Microtraining method is based on several current learning theories and concepts, one of the most important of which is the theory of Social Constructivism, which sees learning as an active process, taking into account the learner's individual background [Vygotsky, 1978]. The second crucial idea comes from the concept of connectivism, which states that learning is not an internal, solitary process, but that new knowledge is acquired best while working and learning in a lively community [Siemens, 2005]. The method Microtraining sessions are structured as follows: 1 Active start (3 minutes) * Start with a mental activity e.g. thinking, reflecting, organizing and comparing * Communicate the goal of the session 2 Exercise / Demonstration (6 minutes) * Connect with different learning styles by using a combination of pictures, sounds and text. * Stimulate the learning process by giving concrete examples 3 Feedback/ Discussion (4 minutes) * Ensure effective, direct and positive feedback * Stimulate both discussion and knowledge sharing between participants * Check if all participants really understand the content by asking questions 4 Conclusion: What's next? How do we learn more? (2 minutes) * What are the topics we will discuss during the next meeting(s) * Discuss how to retain the knowledge * Stimulate involvement and ensure participants leave with a clear goal References * Cross, J.: Informal Learning: Rediscovering the Natural Pathways that Inspire Innovation and Performance.

It would create an invisible microwave dome around an airport that could block missiles heading toward incoming and outgoing aircraft.Raytheon focuses on non-lethal weapons,Andrew Johnson, (The Arizona Republic, 09-17-2009) Man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) are shoulder- launched surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) that present a tremendous threat to both civilian and military aircraft. It is estimated 700,000 MANPADs have been built and sold across the world, thousands of which are unaccounted for and sold daily on the black market. The U.S. government says these type of weapons have been used in at least 36 attacks on civilian aircraft in the past three decades. A successful attack of this kind would cause more than loss of life. The estimated cost of a four-hour operational shut down of an airport is $40 million. This would have an estimated $10 billion impact on the U.S. economy and an estimated $300 billion impact globally.  History  Raytheon's experimentation with directed energy weapons began when its research labs' experiments had inadvertently produced the first microwave oven in 1958. Under William Swanson, Raytheon‚Äôs chairman and CEO, the company has become even more focused on directed energy systems. He has stated \\"When I look at directed energy, it's clear that if someone is gonna put us out of business, it will be us.\\" Raytheon Missile Systems developed Vigilant Eagle under a U.S. Defense Department contract and has discussed with the Department of Homeland Security, the potential of using it at U.S. airports. In 2006, a $4.1 million contract with the Department of Homeland Security was issued to assess the anti-missile system. Within the last three years, the company's researchers have shot down multiple types of shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles at a distance of several miles with pulses of microwave energy. The company says that its prototype high-power microwave (HPM) weapon, with an energy focused to within 1 degree, sends an electrical pulse which penetrates through openings in the missile‚Äôs metal parts and reaches its computers and guidance system. This energy is powerful enough to damage electrical components and scramble computer chips, causing the missile to fly off course. Raytheon has tested the system at an American airport, but both the company and the airport are unwilling to disclose which one because of a confidentiality agreement.  Effects  Examples of shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles The VE works by directing electromagnetic radiation; specifically, a set of high-frequency microwaves toward any projectile fired at an aircraft that is either taking off or landing. For example, if someone were to launch a shoulder-fired projectile or missile from outside the airport during an aircraft's takeoff, the VE airfield would detect the missile's presence and would shoot a microwave beam to deflect it from the airfield. Vigilant Eagle consists of three major components: a missile detecting and tracking subsystem (MDT), a command and control system, and a scanning array. The MDT is a fixed grid of passive infrared (IR) cameras. The command and control system determines where the launch of the projectile is taking place. Using the scanning array, it can interfere with the MANPAD's guidance system and deflect it away from the aircraft.  Advantages and disadvantages  The first large difference between the ground-based Vigilant Eagle and other aircraft protection systems is the lower cost between it and its rivals. Mike Booen, Raytheon‚Äôs chief of directed-energy programs estimates that the system can be built for about $25 million per airport if the system is deployed in at least twenty-five airports. Of all the airports located within the U.S., the top 31 airports account for 70 percent of the country‚Äôs takeoffs and landings. \\"If Vigilant Eagle is installed in all of them, the expenditure would total less than $1 billion, compared with the $6‚Äì$12 billion it would take to install protection systems on 6,000 aircraft\\". Airline carriers have also stated concerns with airplane-mounted systems because of the weight and cost of these systems. The DHS has stated that the cost of each flight carrying the countermeasure would be approximately $350; however, during the airlines‚Äô best year ever, they only earned about $600 per flight. It is also unclear whether the airlines or the government would bear the cost of using these types of systems. The biggest challenges in implementing this new system is whether the private and public sectors can be convinced the new technology is worth the expensive price and difficult logistics. A government-accountability report from April 2009 cited several the problems facing the Defense Department's non-lethal weapons program. This report used another of Raytheon's non-lethal weapons systems, the Active Denial System, as an example. One of the problems discussed was that the systems' components were \\"too complex\\". Critics of the program have also stated that the diameter of protection provided by the system is inadequate to thwart all threats imposed by MANPADS. The University of Southern California reported in a study funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that ‚Äúthe capability of MANPADS to reach targets at altitudes of up to or beyond 15,000 feet allow these weapons to be used at a radius of 50 miles or more from most airports, making perimeter facility control largely ineffective.‚Äù Northrop Grumman has also estimated that \\"the zone of vulnerability around the airport is 300 square miles.\\" This would mean that the system would need to utilize a perimeter around the airport that is believed to be ‚Äúunrealistic.‚Äù See also * Area denial weapon, to prevent an adversary from occupying or traversing an area * Directed-energy weapons * Long Range Acoustic Device * Missile defense * Radiation  References  Category:Non-lethal weapons Category:Counter-terrorism in the United States Category:Directed-energy weapon of the United States Category:Missile defense Category:Raytheon Company products ","title":"Vigilant Eagle"},{"id":"24431184","text":"Portrait of the artist and his family, ca. 1590, now at the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam Jacob Willemszoon Delff the Elder, (c. 1550 in Gouda5 May 1601 in Delft)Delff, Jacob Willemsz.

Biography Seventh of eight children, Puccioni was born in and grew up in Rome. After graduating in architecture at the Sapienza University of Rome, he won a Fulbright scholarship that allowed him to study at CalArts in Los Angeles where he received MFA in Film and Video in 1991. Career He started his professional career working for Rai Television, directing short docudramas. After directing a series of short films for the festival circuit he produced the film project Intolerance, a collective film against racism made up of shorts. He directed one of the shorts, while the others were directed by several other young Italian filmmakers such as Gabriele Muccino and Paolo Virz√¨, but also by veteran director Citto Maselli. Puccioni made his full feature directorial debut in 2001 with Quello che Cerchi (\\"What you are looking for\\"). Using several digital formats, it is a road movie telling the story of a detective and a runaway teenager. The film, released in Italy in 2002, was awarded in the festival circuit and was greeted by Nanni Moretti as one of the best film debut of the year. Between 2003 and 2006, he went back working for television and directed several documentaries and short films. Among those the short Corpo Immagine with the actress Piera Degli Esposti and the still unknown and young Nicolas Vaporidis was presented at the 61st Venice Film Festival. In 2007, his second feature film Riparo (distributed as Shelter Me in the US and as Shelter in other countries) premiered at the 57th Berlin International Film Festival. Contains a longer list of reviews in the Italian press. Riparo was screened at the New Directors/New Films series among the over 90 festivals around the world. The film starred the international actress Maria de Medeiros and tells the story of a lesbian couple and an Arab teenager who illegally immigrated to Italy. Il Colore delle Parole (\\"The Color of Words\\") is a feature documentary that premiered at 66th Venice Film Festival about the roots and the multiple identities of the African community in Italy.

Education John Carver was educated at Fort Street High School'A scientist of world renown', Canberra Times, 23 February 2005 and obtained a first-class honors degree in physics in 1947 from the University of Sydney. On an Australian National University scholarship, he went to Cambridge and obtained a PhD in nuclear physics. Career After obtaining a PhD from Cambridge, Carver returned to the Australian National University (ANU) as a Research Fellow in the Department of Nuclear Physics. Eight years later, he won the position of Elder Chair of Physics at the University of Adelaide. This institution was not well equipped for nuclear physics research, and so Carver utilised the proximity of the Weapons Research Establishment and entered the field of atmospheric physics. Carver was involved in the design and launch of the first Australian- made satellite, which recorded data on the absorption of ultraviolet radiation in the upper atmosphere over a number of years. In 1970 Professor Carver was elected to the chair of the UN Scientific and Technical Sub-Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and he held this position for the next 26 years. In 2000 he was awarded the UN's COSPAR Medal for this outstanding contribution. In 1978 he returned to the ANU as director of the Research School of Physical Sciences, a position he held until 1992.

Jones. Originally listed at Grade II by English Heritage for its architectural and historical importance, its status was upgraded further to \\"Grade II*\\" on 18 March 2011. The Art Deco design has been described by The Daily Telegraph as \\"particularly glorious, with its elegant, curved lines ‚Äì rather like a stately ocean liner.\\" Description The pool measures and can accommodate 500 bathers.  History  The lido was built in 1937-38 to designs by the architect Richard Jones, and was hailed as the most innovative design of its type in Britain. With its tea terrace, sun deck, and caf√© perched on the flat roof and distinctive curved wings at either end, it became the only lido to be featured in the Design Museum in London. In 1958, Butlins attempted to buy the derelict lido for development. The application was opposed by residents and eventually rejected by the Ministry of Housing. In 1998, the lido was reopened by Sports Minister Tony Banks. The restoration was achieved through a public and private sector partnership costing ¬£2 million. Banks revealed he had a personal link to the Grade II listed building through his mother, who used to visit it during the Second World War. He said: \\"Open air sites are not able to attract National Lottery funding, so the money for this had to come through private investors having the vision to bring a piece of our heritage back into use.\\" The reopening ceremony came two days after the lido let in its first visitors for three years. On 18 March 2011, John Penrose, the Minister for Tourism and Heritage in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, approved the upgrade of Saltdean Lido's listed status from Grade II to the second highest grade, Grade II*. Such buildings are defined as being \\"particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest\\". On 30 May 2012, it was announced that the ownership of the Lido would be handed back by leaseholder Dennis Audley to Brighton and Hove City Council after legal discussions.Saltdean Lido: Campaigners' joy as pool handed back, BBC News, 31 May 2012James, Ben Residents joy over Saltdean Lido deal, The Argus, 1 June 2012 After an extensive campaign by local residents, the Save Saltdean Lido Campaign successfully lobbied the freeholders of the site (Brighton & Hove City Council) to stop housing development and take back the lease on the site. Following a 9-month procurement process the Saltdean Lido Community Interest Company (set up by the campaign group) took ownership of a 60-year lease in 2014. The lido reopened in 2017.

Some objects found by the Muslims when they entered Khaybar‚Äîa siege-engine, 20 bales of Yemenite cloth, and 500 cloaks‚Äîpoint out to an intense trade carried out by the Jews. In the past some scholars attempted to explain the siege-engine by suggesting that it was used for settling quarrels among the families of the community. Today most academics believe it was stored in a dep√¥t for future sale, in the same way that swords, lances, shields, and other weaponry had been sold by the Jews to Arabs. Equally, the cloth and the cloaks may have been intended for sale, as it was unlikely that such a quantity of luxury goods were kept for the exclusive use of the Jews. However, these commercial activities led to some resentment that is similar to the economic causes that were behind persecutions in many other countries throughout history.Veccia Vaglieri, L. \\"Khaybar\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam Expulsion of the Jews from Khaybar During the reign of Caliph Umar (634‚Äì644), the Jewish community of Khaybar were transported alongside the Christian community of Najran to the newly conquered regions of Syria and Iraq.

However, Umar also forbade non-Muslims to reside in the Hejaz for longer than three days.Giorgio Levi Della Vida and Michael Bonner, Encyclopaedia of Islam, and Madelung, The Succession to Prophet Muhammad, p. 74 Since then, the Jews of Khaybar traveled around many areas throughout the Islamic Empire as artisans and merchants and maintained a distinctive identity until the 12th century.

Hayato Sakamoto broke the tie in the fifth inning when he hit a double off the left field wall, scoring Tani and Shinnosuke Abe, who singled to open the inning. Gonzalez was relieved by Tetsuya Yamaguchi in the sixth inning after he allowed Fighters' hitters to reach first and second with one out. The Giants' lead was then cut to one after Yamaguchi gave up an RBI single to Tomohiro Nioka before retiring the next two batters. The Giants responded when Yoshinori Tateyama relieved Takeda to start the seventh inning. Tateyama gave up a single to Tani before being replaced by Masanori Hayashi who immediately gave up a single to Abe. With runners at first and third, Noriyoshi Omichi was brought in as a pinch hitter, and Fighters' manager Masataka Nashida responded by bringing in Shintaro Ejiri. After this pitching change, Giants' manager Tatsunori Hara switched pinch hitters and sent Lee Seung-Yeop to the plate instead of Omichi. Ejiri gave up an RBI single to Lee then retired the next two batters, finishing out the top half of the inning with the Giants leading 4‚Äì2. Ejiri continued to pitch through a scoreless eighth inning and was followed up by Naoki Miyanishi, who kept the Giants hitless in the ninth. After Yamaguchi pitched through a scoreless seventh inning, Daisuke Ochi put together a hitless eighth. In the ninth inning, the Fighters put the leadoff man on first against Giants' closer Marc Kroon. With two outs, Shinji Takahashi cut the Giants' lead to one run when he doubled off the wall in center. Kroon then put the winning run on first after he walked Sledge but earned a save after striking out the next batter, resulting in Gonzalez's first career postseason win. Game 2 Due to injury, Yu Darvish (seen here in 2007) pitched for the first time in 43 days when he started Game 2. Despite experiencing back soreness and shoulder fatigue, Yu Darvish started Game 2 for the Fighters. Darvish had not pitched since September 20, 43 days before his surprising Game 2 start. A week before the series, trainer Seiichiro Nakagaki stated that it would be \\"virtually impossible for him to pitch in the series\\". Pitching coach Masato Yoshii echoed this belief when he stated that he would require a \\"miraculous recovery\\" to pitch in time for the series. Darvish was seen practicing before Saturday's series opener, however, prompting some speculation that he would make an appearance in the series. During the game, spectators noticed that Darvish had altered his pitching form‚Äîhe shortened his stride to prevent aggravating his lower back injury. After the series, Darvish assessed his health and believed that he was \\"about 50 percent\\". The Giants started Tetsuya Utsumi, who had not pitched since a regular season game on October 12. He pitched into the third inning, where, with two outs, he gave up a solo home run to Atsunori Inaba. Shinji Takahashi then doubled and quickly scored on an RBI single by the next batter, Terrmel Sledge. The Fighters continued to produce offense as Eiichi Koyano reached base on an infield single. Sledge and Koyano both scored on Yoshio Itoi's right field double. Utsumi was then relieved by Shun Tono, who ended the Fighters' four-run third inning. The Giants cut the Fighters' lead in half by scoring two runs in the top of the fourth inning. With two outs, Alex Ram√≠rez singled before Yoshiyuki Kamei hit a home run off the left field foul pole. Darvish continued to pitch into the sixth inning after getting out of a fifth inning bases-loaded situation by striking out former teammate Michihiro Ogasawara. Relieving Darvish at the start of the seventh inning, Naoki Miyanishi pitched a scoreless inning, while Takayuki Kanamori followed it up with a scoreless inning of his own. Closer Hisashi Takeda then earned a save after completing a scoreless ninth to secure the win for the Fighters 4‚Äì2. Game 3 Atsunori Inaba's (seen here in 2008) first-inning home run was the first of six total by both teams. Wearing a Giants' jacket, former U.S. President and US Major League Baseball team owner George W. Bush threw the ceremonial first pitch to Giants' catcher Shinnosuke Abe prior to Game 3. Bush watched the game from a private box with former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, U.S. Ambassador John Roos and former Giants' player and manager Sadaharu Oh. In the first inning, Atsunori Inaba hit a solo home run off Giants' starter Wirfin Obispo. Eiichi Koyano put the Fighters up 2‚Äì0 with a solo home run of his own in the second. The home runs continued during the Giants' half of the inning when both Lee Seung-Yeop and Shinnosuke Abe hit solo shots off Fighters' starter Keisaku Itokazu. A Michihiro Ogasawara home run then gave the Giants a one-run lead in the bottom of the third. After a scoreless fourth inning, Kensuke Tanaka tied it up with the game's final home run in the fifth. Both teams' combined six home runs narrowly missed tying the Japan Series record of seven achieved by the Giants and Kintetsu Buffaloes during 1989's Game 7. With two outs in the bottom of the fifth inning, Itokazu walked Hayato Sakamoto then gave up a single to Tetsuya Matsumoto. Ogasawara brought in both runners when he doubled to left-center field, putting the Giants up 5-3. Masanori Hayashi replaced Itokazu at the start of the sixth to retire three straight Giants batters. After relieving Obispo to start the seventh, Daisuke Ochi pitched a scoreless half-inning. Brought in to pitch in the eighth inning, Tetsuya Yamaguchi hit the first batter, Tanaka; two consecutive errors then allowed Tanaka to score, cutting the Giants' lead to one. Fighters pitcher Kazumasa Kikuchi, who had pitched a scoreless seventh inning, was relieved by Shintaro Ejiri in the eighth after putting two batters on base. Abe gave the Giants two insurance runs when he drove home both of Ejiri's inherited runners with a two-out single. Kroon was brought in to start the ninth; despite allowing a base runner on the Giants' third error of the game, Kroon preserved the team's three-run lead. The win marked the Giants' 100th Series victory in franchise history. Game 4 Game 5 Game 6 Tetsuya Utsumi (seen here in 2006) received a Game 6 win after replacing the injured Shun Tono in the first inning. For Game 6, the Giants decided to skip starting pitcher Tetsuya Utsumi after he allowed four runs in two and two-thirds innings in game two; pitcher Shun Tono started the game in his place. However, after facing four batters, Tono was forced to leave the game in the first inning after a hit by Shinji Takahashi struck him on his right wrist. Inheriting runners on second and third with two outs, Utsumi entered the game and retired Terrmel Sledge for the final out of the inning. In the top of the second inning, Yoshiyuki Kamei reached base with a one-out double off of Fighters' starter Masaru Takeda and advanced to third base on a Yoshitomo Tani ground out. Kamei then scored when Shinnosuke Abe doubled to deep center field, giving the Giants the lead. In the top of the sixth inning, Takeda gave up a two-out single to Tetsuya Matsumoto. Fighters right fielder Atsunori Inaba then fell down while attempting to field a ball hit by Michihiro Ogasawara, resulting in the game's only error. This error allowed Matsumoto to score from first base. Utsumi continued to pitch into the bottom of the inning until he was relieved by Kiyoshi Toyoda. Utsumi's scoreless four and two-thirds innings (eventually resulting in a win) was seen as a redemption after his short Game 2 outing and four previous Japan Series losses. Takeda pitched a scoreless seventh inning, followed by Giants reliever Tetsuya Yamaguchi who did the same in the bottom of the inning. Takeda pitched into the eighth inning until he was relieved by Shintaro Ejiri, who closed out the top of the inning. In the bottom of the inning, Daisuke Ochi surrendered a leadoff single followed by two strikeouts and a walk. Kroon was then brought in to face pinch hitter Tomochika Tsuboi who grounded out to finish the eighth inning. After Fighters closer Masanori Hayashi held the Giants to two runs in the final inning, Kroon gave up a leadoff double to Tomohiro Nioka and allowed the pinch runner to reach third later in the inning. He then struck out Inaba and Takahashi to achieve the four-out save and secure the series. Despite having runners on base every inning and leaving a total of 13 on base, the Giants completed a six-pitcher shutout.

History AMS, 1954)|left In the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, Daomei () in Gangwei was one of the areas from which PLA forces shelled Kinmen County (Quemoy), Republic of China (Taiwan). The Daomei milita dug eleven trenches and built 136 air raid shelters. On September 8, Chinese Nationalist forces fired 1,285 shells at Wu Yu, destroying 151 homes and a granary. 37 members of the Daomei militia took eight boats to Wu Yu bringing 130,000 jin of food for the islanders. No one died or was injured. In February‚ÄìMarch 1959, Huojian Commune ('rocket commune'; ) and Hongqi Commune ('red flag commune'; ) were combined to create Gangwei Commune (). In late 1984, Gangwei Commune became Gangwei Township (). On January 1, 1988, ten villages of Gangwei Township were transferred to Longjiao She Ethnic Township (). On December 29, 1988, Gangwei Township became Gangwei Town (). Railway development plans include the construction of a 45-km-long branch line from Zhangzhou railway station eastward, across most of Longhai City, to terminate at the China Merchants Group industrial area () on the southwestern shore of Xiamen Harbor, opposite Xiamen Island (). The branch will be known as the Gangwei Railway (), and will support trains running at speeds up to 120 km/h.

The fruit body has several characteristics with which it may be identified: a dark reddish-brown cap; yellow to greenish-yellow pores on the undersurface of the cap; and a reddish-brown stem with long narrow reticulations. Aureoboletus mirabilis is found in coniferous forests along the Pacific Coast of North America, and in Asia. Unusual for boletes, A. mirabilis sometimes appears to fruit on the wood or woody debris of Hemlock, suggesting a saprobic lifestyle. Despite occasional appearances to the contrary, Aureoboletus mirabilis is mycorrhizal, and forms close mutualistic associations with hemlock roots. Taxonomy and phylogeny William Murrill originally described Aureboletus mirabilis. Aureoboletus mirabilis was first described by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912 as Ceriomyces mirabilis, based on specimens found in Seattle, Washington. In a subsequent publication that same year, he switched the genus to Boletus. In 1940, fungal taxonomist Rolf Singer transferred the taxon to the genus Xerocomus; five years later he switched it to Boletellus. However, many mycologists did not recognize the distinction between Boletus and Boletellus before molecular phylogenetics studies found them to be distinct genera. In 1966, American mycologist Harry Delbert Thiers wrote about the issue in his survey of California boletes: > The proper disposition of this species in the present taxonomic scheme of > the boletes is somewhat debatable. ... The distinction between Boletus and > Boletellus is not so clear-cut. The spores are typically smooth which, in > conjunction with the divergent tube trama, dry to moist pileus and yellow > tubes, seem to place it very convincingly in Boletus. However, the present > disposition in Boletellus seems most satisfactory to me. The sporocarps have > the stature and general appearance of other members of that genus such as > Boletellus russellii and B. ananas (Curt.) Murr. These similarities include > the disproportionately long stipe which is frequently shaggy-reticulate and > constricted at the apex, and a comparatively small pileus. Nine years later, after further consideration, Thiers changed his mind: > In an earlier paper this species was considered to belong to the genus > Boletellus because of its stature, general appearance, and because some > workers had reported the spores as being obscurely punctate or roughened. > Repeated examinations of California material have failed to reveal any > roughened spores and since, in modern concepts Boletellus is restricted to > species having such spores, it has been placed back in Boletus. The species has also been placed in genus Heimioporus, newly described in 2004 by Swiss mycologist Egon Horak. In 2015 it was transferred to the genus Aureoboletus based on DNA evidence. The specific epithet mirabilis means \\"admirable\\" or \\"marvelous\\". Aureoboletus mirabilis is commonly known as the \\"admirable bolete\\", the \\"bragger's bolete\\", and the \\"velvet top\\". In a 2001 analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences for a number of taxa in the Boletales order, A. mirabilis was found to be most closely related to species such as Boletus edulis, Phylloporus rhodoxanthus, and Tylopilus felleus. Within the Boletales clade (a group of related species roughly equivalent to the Boletales order), these species were all in the so-called \\"boletoid radiation\\", a group of taxa that are thought to have diverged evolutionarily from a single boletoid ancestor. However, more recent studies containing more taxa have found A. mirabilis to be most closely related to Aureoboletus species. Description The bulk of Aureoboletus mirabilis is typically hidden from sight, existing as masses of almost invisible fungal threads called mycelium, which form the active feeding and growing structures of the fungus. The mushrooms, or fruit bodies are created solely for the production of spores by which the fungus reproduces itself. The caps of the fruit bodies are up to in diameter, red or brownish-red in color, initially convex but flattening out as they develop. The cap is fleshy, with a rough surface that is slippery or slimy in young specimens, or in moist environments. Older specimens generally have dry and velvety cap surfaces. The texture of the cap surface is rough, at first because of flattened-down (appressed) fibrils, and later with bent-back (recurved) scales or sometimes with cracked rough patches that resemble dried cracked mud. Young specimens may have a small flap of thin tissue attached to the margin or edge of the cap, remnants of a reduced partial veil. The surface is covered with tufts of soft woolly hairs, and has persistent papillae. The tubes underneath the cap are up to long, and are initially pale yellowish before becoming greenish-yellow with age, or mustard- yellow if injured. The pores have diameters of 1‚Äì2 mm. The flesh can be pale pink, yellow, or white in color, firm but watery, thick, and either not changing color or becoming deeper yellow with bruising. The flesh is thick at the junction of the stem with the cap. The stem is up to long, usually thickest at the base and tapering upward, up to thick below and at the apex. It typically starts out with a bulbous shape but becomes more equal in width throughout as it matures. The surface is dry, often roughened and pitted, and with a network of grooves or ridges (striations) or reticulations near the top of the stem. It is about the same color as the cap, but will bruise to a darker reddish-brown near the base. The stem is solid (that is, not hollow), and its flesh pale purplish at the top, but yellowish below. Mycelium at the base of the stem is also yellow. Microscopic characteristics Collected in deposit, the spores of B. mirabilis are olive-brown. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are spindle-shaped to roughly elliptical, with smooth, thick walls, and have dimensions of 18‚Äì22 by 7‚Äì9 ¬µm. Overholts' 1940 publication on the species reported spore dimensions of 20‚Äì26 by 8‚Äì9 ¬µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), 4-spored, and have dimensions of 31‚Äì36 by 7‚Äì11 ¬µm. Cystidia (sterile cells on the face of a gill) are thin-walled, and measure 60‚Äì90 by 10‚Äì18 ¬µm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae. Edibility Aureoboletus mirabilis is edible, yet tasteless according to Murrill, who also noted \\"this is one of the most difficult species to preserve, owing to its extremely juicy consistency\\". In contrast, modern field guides suggest this species to be an excellent edible. The Polish Heritage Cookery book opines that in taste, only Boletus edulis surpasses it. When sauteed in butter, the flesh has been noted to have a lemony taste. However, field specimens covered with a white mold, Sepedonium ampullosporum, should not be consumed. Chemical reactions Chemical tests are sometimes used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments present in the fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions may be used as taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B. mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue. Similar species Aureoboletus mirabilis differs from other boletes in the covering of the cap, which superficially resembles that found on the surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, and the absence of a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A. mirabilis by the color and texture of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America. Habitat and distribution Growing out of a decaying hemlock stump, Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Washington, USA The fruit bodies of Aureoboletus mirabilis grow solitarily, scattered, or sometimes in small groups on the ground or on well-decayed conifer logs, especially of western and mountain hemlock, but occasionally also Douglas-fir and western red cedar. The fungus is strongly suspected to form mycorrhizal associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing B. mirabilis mycorrhizae in laboratory culture have failed. Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown cubical rot‚Äîa trait suggestive of cellulose-decomposing saprobic fungi‚Äîthe rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant conifer roots. It has been suggested that B. mirabilis has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other mycorrhizal fungi, and further, that the inability to culture mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown cubical rot are required for fungal growth. Aureoboletus mirabilis, which usually appears from late summer to autumn, is distributed in the hemlock forests of the Pacific Coast Ranges from Northern California to Alaska, the Cascade Range, as well as in interior forests such as in Manitoba. It has a disjunct distribution, as it has been also been collected in Japan and Taiwan.

Described as new to science in 1971, it is commonly known as the manzanita bolete for its usual mycorrhizal association with manzanita trees. Its fruit bodies (mushrooms) have sticky reddish to brown caps up to , and its stipes are up to long and thick. They have a whitish background color punctuated with small black scales known as scabers. Found only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, it is the most common Leccinum species in California. The mushroom is edible, although opinions vary as to its quality. L. manzanitae can be usually distinguished from other similar bolete mushrooms by its large size, reddish cap, dark scabers on a whitish stipe, and association with manzanita and madrone. Taxonomy Leccinum manzanitae was first described by the American mycologist Harry Delbert Thiers in 1971, from collections made in San Mateo County, California, the previous year. In that state, it is known as the manzanita bolete because of its close association with manzanita trees. It is classified in subsection Versicolores of the section Leccinum in the genus Leccinum. Closely related species in this section include L. piceinum, L. monticola, L. albostipitatum, and L. versipelle. Description The pore surface is whitish, with pores up to 1 mm broad. The fruit bodies of Leccinum manzanitae are sometimes massive, occasionally reaching weights of several pounds. The cap is in diameter, spherical to convex when young, and broadly convex to flattened or cushion- shaped (pulvinate). The surface of the cap is often shallowly to deeply pitted or reticulate, sticky, and covered with pressed-down hairs that are more conspicuous toward the edge of the cap. Its color is dark red during all stages of development. The cap's flesh is thick, white when first exposed, but slowly and irregularly changing to dark brownish-gray with no reddish intermediate state. The change in color upon bruising or injury is often more pronounced in young specimens. The tubes comprising the hymenophore are long, with an adnate attachment to the stipe; their color is pale olive when young and darkens when bruised. Pores are up to 1 mm in diameter, angular, and the same color as the tubes. The stipe is long, and thick at the apex, and either club-shaped or swollen in the middle. It is solid (i.e., not hollow), with a dry surface, and covered with small, stiff, granular projections called scabers. The scabers are usually whitish when young, but eventually turn dark brownish-grey with age. The stipe flesh stains a bluish color when bruised, although this reaction is variable and sometimes slow to occur. It has no distinctive taste or odor. Spores are somewhat elliptical to cylindrical and tapered on each end. Leccinum manzanitae mushroom produce a cinnamon-brown spore print. Spores are 13‚Äì17 by 4‚Äì5.5 ¬µm, somewhat elliptical to cylindrical, and tapered on each end (fusoid); their walls are smooth and moderately thick. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 27‚Äì32 by 6‚Äì9 ¬µm, club-shaped to pear-shaped (pyriform) and four-spored. The cystidia are 23‚Äì32 by 4‚Äì6 ¬µm, fusoid to club-shaped with narrow, elongated apices. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe surface) are thin-walled, club-shaped to somewhat fusoid, and sometimes end in a sharp point; they measure 35‚Äì45 by 9‚Äì14 ¬µm. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae of Leccinum manzanitae. The hyphae of the cap cuticle are arranged in the form of a trichoderm (wherein the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, perpendicular to the cap surface). Several chemical tests can be used to help confirm the identify of the mushroom: a drop of dilute (3‚Äì10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution will turn the tubes pale red whereas nitric acid (HNO3) on the tubes produces orange-yellow; a solution of Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) applied to the flesh results in a pale grey color. Thiers also described the variety L. manzanitae var. angustisporae from Mendocino County. Similar to the main form in appearance and habitat, it has smaller, narrowly elongated spores, typically 3‚Äì4 ¬µm wide and 1‚Äì2 ¬µm longer. Edibility Leccinum manzanitae is edible, and its taste is sometimes rated highly, although others have described the flavor as bland. Drying the mushroom may improve the flavor. One field guide advises caution when selecting this species for the table, as there have been poisonings reported with similar-looking mushrooms found in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Similar species In the field, Leccinum manzanitae fruit bodies can be usually distinguished from those of other similar bolete species by its large size, reddish cap, dark scabers on a whitish stipe, and association with manzanita and madrone. L. ponderosum also has a dark red sticky cap, but its flesh does not darken upon exposure, and its cap is smooth when young. L. armeniacum also grows with manzanita and madrone, but its cap is more orange. L. aeneum, known only from California, is another species that associates with manzanitae and madrone. It has an orangish cap and whitish scabers on the stipe that do not darken significantly as the mushroom matures. L. insigne, found in coniferous forests with aspens, has a coloration similar to L. manzanitae. The brown-capped L. scabrum is associated with ornamental birch, usually in cultivated landscapes. L. constans, also found exclusively in California, is paler, and does not undergo color changes when the cut flesh is exposed to air; it is found near madrone in coastal regions. The species L. largentii, found in northern regions of the West Coast, has a dry cap with a fibrillose to scaly edge, dark olive pores, and densely arranged scabers on the stipe. It associates with toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia). Habitat and distribution Leccinum manzanitae is a mycorrhizal species. Its fruit bodies grow singly to scattered in soil under madrone and manzanita. Known to occur only in North America, it is commonly found from central California to southern Oregon, but has also been reported further north in Washington and British Columbia (Canada). Thiers considered it the most abundant Leccinum in California.

First described scientifically by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, the species has been juggled by various authors to several genera, including Boletus, Boletellus, and Xerocomus. Found solely in western North America from British Columbia south to Mexico, the fruit bodies are distinguished by their dark reddish brown to nearly black caps with uneven surfaces, the yellow pores on the underside of the caps, and the red-streaked yellow stems. The fungus grows in summer and autumn on the ground, often in Douglas fir forests or on their margins. The development of the fruit bodies is gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane. Taxonomy Xerocomellus zelleri was first described by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, based on specimens he found on the campus of the University of Washington. Murrill named it Ceriomyces zelleri before switching the genus later that year to Boletus. In 1944, Walter Henry Snell thought the taxon would be more appropriate in the genus Xerocomus. In 1959, mycologists Rolf Singer, Snell and Esther A. Dick transferred the species to Boletellus, explaining that the microstructure of the trama and the faint ornamentation of the spores were inconsistent with placement in Xerocomus. American mycologist Harry D. Thiers, in his 1976 monograph on North American boletes, claimed that he failed to consistently find ornamentation on the spores of material he collected, and preferred to retain the species in Boletus. In 2011, it was moved to the genus Xerocomellus. The specific epithet zelleri was chosen by Murrill to honor Professor Sanford Myron Zeller, mycologist at Oregon State University. Zeller accompanied Murrill in his Seattle expedition, and discovered the first specimens of the mushroom. Description The cap is typically between in diameter, initially convex but flattening somewhat in maturity. It is fleshy, with an uneven velvety surface, and dark brown to nearly black; the margin of the cap is a pale cream color. Young specimens are covered by a grayish bloom. The yellow to dirty yellow flesh inconsistently bruises blue when cut or broken. The tubes that comprise the undersurface of the cap (the hymenium) are up to long and angular, yellow, becoming dirty yellow and finally greenish- yellow; there are 1‚Äì2 pores per millimeter on the hymenium surface. They do not change color when bruised, although they may turn slightly brownish when exposed to the air for a time. The flesh is yellow to dirty yellow, up to thick, and inconsistently bruises blue when cut or broken. The stem is up to tall, thick, and swollen toward the base. The stem surface is red or yellowish with red lines, often white or yellow at the base, and solid (that is, not hollow), with fibrous flesh; in maturity the stem ages to yellowish-red to dark red. The spore print is olive-brown; one source notes that creating a spore print may result in \\"a lot of yellow juice on the paper\\". The spores are ellipsoid in shape, smooth, and have dimensions of 12‚Äì16 by 4‚Äì6 ¬µm, although occasionally there will be some \\"giant spores\\" with lengths of up to 24 ¬µm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are 26‚Äì35 by 9.5‚Äì12 ¬µm, and four-spored. The cystidia are roughly cylindrical and thin-walled, with dimensions of 38‚Äì77 by 5.5‚Äì14.8 ¬µm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae. The fruit body tissue stains a greenish color when a drop of ammonia solution is applied. Edibility Xerocomellus zelleri is an edible species, although care should be taken to ensure that specimens collected for consumption are free of fly larvae. In his book 100 Edible Mushrooms, Michael Kuo gave the mushroom an edibility rating of \\"mediocre\\". There is no distinguishable odor, and the taste is alternately described as pleasant, mild, or \\"slightly acidic\\". The original species description noted that the texture was \\"slightly mucilaginous\\". The mushroom is suitable for preserving or drying, or as a \\"filler\\" to add bulk to a dish. It is harvested and sold commercially in local markets in British Columbia, Canada. Similar species The red-cracked bolete (Xerocomellus chrysenteron) has an olive-brown cap that cracks, exposing flesh that ages to pinkish red. Boletellus chrysenteroides, found only in eastern North America, has a velvety to smooth, dark reddish brown, cracked cap with pale exposed flesh. Fruit body development A collection from Banner Forest, Kitsap County, Washington, USA In 1914, Zeller published a study of the development of the mushroom, made possible by the prolific fruiting of the fungus in Seattle in the fall of 1912. Development was studied by examining thin sections of tissues in different stages of development, and the differentiation of tissues and structures followed by using histological stains. The growth form of Xerocomellus zelleri is called gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane. In this type of development, the cap is formed from hyphae at the top of the stem and subsequently expands by growth along the margins; the hymenium forms later beneath the cap in a direction away from the center. The mushrooms originate as minute fruit bodies (called \\"pins\\" due to their shape) from a yellow mycelium that forms a mat and tends to engulf pine needles. The pins, typically 1‚Äì2 mm in diameter, lengthen vertically until they are roughly three or four times longer than they are thick. Until this point, the fruit body is a homogenous mass of tissue. It differentiates simultaneously into cap and stem along a cleavage plane (an axis along which any cell division occurs) from the outside inward, which gives rise to deep furrow encircling the fruit body. The hymenium is formed in the roof of this furrow, growing inward and upward from the outside edge. The cap develops from the upper section of this division, the stem from the lower. Habitat and distribution In Lincoln County, Oregon This species grows solitarily or in small groups on the ground or in forest duff in mature coniferous forests, occasionally abundant on grassy edges of the forest, rarely on badly decayed conifer logs. It is an ectomycorrhizal mushroom, meaning that the fungal hyphae form sheaths around the rootlets of certain trees, exchanging nutrients with them in a mutualistic relationship. The fungus associates with alder, poplar and other hardwoods, and has been shown in laboratory culture to form ectomycorrhizae with Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). However, the fungus may have saprobic tendencies, as it has been noted to grow under California Redwood (sometimes in the rotted wood of old trunks), a tree not known to form mycorrizhae. It is known to form long rhizomorphs (aggregations of hyphae that resemble roots), and has been noted to be more abundant in sites with buried wood than without. In British Columbia, it occurs from summer to early winter, although it also appears infrequently in early spring. In California, the mushroom often fruits after the rainy period in autumn through to March or April. The dark coloring of the cap make this species difficult to notice, \\"unless a glimpse of the yellow hymenium is obtained\\". Fruit bodies are eaten by the American shrew-mole. Xerocomellus zelleri is distributed in North America in the Pacific Northwest south to California and Mexico. In Mexico, it has been reported in high- altitude cloud forests of Mexican Beech (Fagus mexicana), a rare and endangered habitat. It has also been reported from Tibet, but this may be based on a misidentification. Chemistry Xerocomellus zelleri has been shown to contain the phenethylamine alkaloid compounds tyramine, N-methyltyramine, and hordenine, although the chemotaxonomic significance of this is not clear.

Commonly known as the chicken fat mushroom, the American slippery Jack (or slipperycap), or the American suillus, it grows in a mycorrhizal association with eastern white pine and is found where this tree occurs in eastern North America and China. The mushroom can be recognized by the bright yellow cap with red to reddish-brown scales embedded in slime, the large yellow angular pores on the underside of the cap, and the narrow yellow stem marked with dark reddish dots. Molecular phylogenetics analysis suggests that S. americanus may be the same species as S. sibiricus, found in western North America and western and central Asia. Suillus americanus is edible, although opinions vary as to its palatability; some susceptible individuals may suffer a contact dermatitis after touching the fruit bodies. The fruit bodies contain a beta glucan carbohydrate shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory properties. Taxonomy and classification Charles Horton Peck Suillus americanus was first described scientifically by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1888, based on specimens he had originally collected as far back as 1869, in New York state, near Sand Lake, Albany, and Port Jefferson. In his 1888 publication he indicated that he had originally listed these collections as Boletus flavidus (now known as Suillus flavidus) in his 1869 Report of the State Botanist (published in 1872). However, as was pointed out nearly a century later in 1986, the 1869 report does not actually mention the species; rather, Peck's field notes that year (which served as the basis for the report) reference a collection at Sand Lake upon which the original (1888) description was most likely based. Because Peck failed to designate a type specimen, one of the Sand Lake specimens was lectotypified in 1986. In 1931, French mycologist √âdouard-Jean Gilbert transferred the species to the genus Ixocomus, a now-defunct taxon that has since been subsumed into Suillus. In 1959, Walter H. Snell, collaborating with Rolf Singer and Esther A. Dick, transferred the species to Suillus. In his 1986 version of the authoritative monograph The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, Singer included the species in the subsection Latiporini of genus Suillus, an infrageneric grouping (below the taxonomic level of genus) characterized by a cinnamon-colored spore print without an olive tinge, and wide pores, typically greater than 1 mm when mature. Common names for the species include the American slipperycap,McKnight (1987), pp. 113‚Äì14. the American suillus, or the chicken-fat mushroom. The latter name is a reference to its yellow color. The specific epithet americanus means \\"of America\\". Description The cap is typically between in diameter, broadly convex with a small umbo (a central elevation) to flat with age. The cap margin is curved inwards in young specimens, and may have remnants of a yellowish, cottony veil hanging from it. The cap surface is colored bright yellow with red or brownish streaks and hairy patches. When the fruit body is young and moist, the surface is slimy; as the cap matures and dries out, it becomes sticky or tacky. The tubes which comprise the pore layer on the underside of the cap are deep, and have an adnate (attached broadly to the stem) to decurrent (running down the length of the stem) attachment to the stem. They are yellow, and stain reddish-brown when bruised. The yellow pores are large (1‚Äì2 mm diameter) and angular, and tend to become darker as they age. The pores are slightly wider than long, so that there are about 9‚Äì10 pores per centimeter measured radially, but 12 to 13 per centimeter when measured tangentially, about halfway to the edge. As is the case with all boletes, spores form on the inner surfaces of the tubes and sift through their openings to be borne away on the air currents outside. The stem is by , roughly equal in width throughout, often crooked, and becomes hollow with age. The color of the stem surface is lemon yellow, and it is covered with glandular dots that bruise if handled. The partial veil is not attached to the stem, and usually does not leave a ring on the stem. A whitish mycelium present at the base of the stem helps anchor the fruit body in the substrate. The flesh is mustard yellow, and stains pinkish-brown when cut or bruised. Microscopic characteristics In deposit, the spores are cinnamon-colored. Viewed with a microscope, they are pale yellow, smooth, and roughly elliptical in shape, and measure 8‚Äì9.5 by 3.5‚Äì5 ¬µm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are club-shaped and 4-spored, with dimensions of 21‚Äì25 by 5.5 to 6 ¬µm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the sides of a gill) range in shape from cylindrical to club-shaped and are arranged in bundles. Both the bases of the bundles and the surface of the cystidia may be covered with brown pigment particles. Cheilocystidia are cystidia located in the gill faces. In S. americanus, they are mostly club-shaped, often with an expanded apex, and like the pleurocystidia, are arranged in bundles, with brown pigment particles at the base of the bundles. Bundles of cystidia near the tube openings may sometimes be visible with a hand lens. Like all Suillus species, the cystidia of S. americanus will turn orange-brown in the presence of a solution of 3% potassium hydroxide. The slimy layer on the cap surface results from an interwoven layer of gelatinous hyphae that are typically 3‚Äì5 ¬µm thick. Edibility Suillus americanus is edible. This species is edible, but opinions about its palatibility are mixed: one author says the fruit bodies are \\"coarse and do not taste good\\"; another mentions the \\"thin flesh hardly make this species worthwhile;\\" yet another says \\"The yellow cap may remind you of chicken fat; it has a wonderfully savory mushroom flavor.\\" The slimy texture of the mushroom has been compared to okra. One cookbook author suggests that the mushroom is ideal for spreads, for use on bread or as a dip; baking the fruit bodies in an oven will dry them for future use, and concentrate the flavor. The odor and taste are mild; one field guide suggests it has a \\"distinctive lemony tang\\".McKnight (1987), p. 393. The slimy caps and the pore layer are typically removed before consumption. Similar species Suillus americanus is very similar in appearance to Suillus sibiricus (distributed in western North America and western and central Asia) but the latter species associates with Pinus monticola and Pinus flexilis rather than Pinus strobus. One field guide suggests that Suillus sibiricus has a thicker stem than S. americanus, brown spots on the cap, and is a darker, more dingy yellow. Molecular phylogenetics analysis has shown, however, that specimens of S. sibricus collected from China and western North America, as well as S. americanus from eastern North America, are most likely \\"a single circumboreal taxon\\". Another lookalike species is Suillus subaureus, which can be distinguished microscopically by slightly smaller, hyaline (translucent) spores (typically 7.5‚Äì8.5 by 3 ¬µm), and an association with Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides). Habitat and distribution S. americanus is known for its association with Eastern white pine. Suillus americanus is a common species, and is found growing solitarily or in clusters on the ground throughout northeastern North America, north to Canada, where it typically fruits in the late summer and autumn. It is also found in Guangdong, China, an example of a disjunct distribution. Fruit bodies can often be found in drier weather when other species are not abundant. Suillus americanus is a mycorrhizal species, a mutualistic relationship where the fungus forms a sheath on the surface of the root from which hyphae extend outward into the soil, and inwards between the cortical cells with which they interface to form a Hartig net. The main benefit for the fungus is constant access to a supply of carbohydrates produced by the plant's photosynthesis, while the plant benefits from an enhanced supply of mineral nutrients from the soil, taken up by the hyphae of the fungus. It grows in association with pines, particularly eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). Allergenicity Some susceptible individuals have experienced an allergic reaction after touching Suillus americanus. The symptoms of allergic contact dermatitis generally develop one to two days after initial contact, persist for roughly a week, then disappear without treatment. Cooking the fruit bodies inactivates the responsible allergens. Bioactive compounds Suillus americanus contains a polysaccharide known as a beta glucan that laboratory tests suggest may have anti-inflammatory activity. Known specifically as a (1‚Üí3)-, (1‚Üí4)-Œ≤-D-glucan, its natural function is as a component of the fungal cell wall, where it forms microcrystalline fibrils in the wall that give it rigidity and strength. The anti-inflammatory activity results from the polysaccharide's ability to inhibit the production of nitric oxide in activated macrophages, a cell of the immune system.

First described by American mycologists in the late 19th century, it is commonly known as the stubby-stalk or the short-stemmed slippery Jack. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) produced by the fungus are characterized by a chocolate to reddish-brown cap covered with a sticky layer of slime, and a short whitish stipe that has neither a partial veil nor prominent, colored glandular dots. The cap can reach a diameter of about , while the stipe is up to long and thick. Like other bolete mushrooms, S. brevipes produces spores in a vertically arranged layer of spongy tubes with openings that form a layer of small yellowish pores on the underside of the cap. Suillus brevipes grows in a mycorrhizal association with various species of two- and three-needled pines, especially lodgepole and ponderosa pine. The fungus is found throughout North America, and has been introduced to several other countries via transplanted pines. In the succession of mycorrhizal fungi associated with the regrowth of jack pine after clearcutting or wildfires, S. brevipes is a multi-stage fungus, found during all stages of tree development. The mushrooms are edible, and are high in the essential fatty acid linoleic acid. Taxonomy The species was first described scientifically as Boletus viscosus by American mycologist Charles Frost in 1874. In 1885, Charles Horton Peck, who had found specimens in pine woods of Albany County, New York, explained that the species name was a taxonomic homonym (Boletus viscosus was already in use for another species named by Ventenat in 1863), and so renamed it to Boletus brevipes. Its current name was assigned by German Otto Kuntze in 1898. William Alphonso Murrill renamed it as Rostkovites brevipes in 1948; the genus Rostkovites is now considered to be synonymous with Suillus. Agaricales specialist Rolf Singer included Suillus brevipes in the subsection Suillus of genus Suillus, an infrageneric (a taxonomic level below genus) grouping of species characterized by a cinnamon-brown spore print, and pores less than 1 mm wide. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal DNA sequences shows that the most closely related species to Suillus brevipes include S. luteus, S. pseudobrevipes, and S. weaverae (formerly Fuscoboletinus weaverae). The specific epithet is derived from the Latin brevipes, meaning \\"short-footed\\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"stubby-stalk\\" or the \\"short-stemmed slippery Jack\\". Description The cap is deep brown to reddish-brown, later fading to tan with age, and it does not bruise with handling. The cap surface is smooth, and, depending on the moisture in the environment, may range from sticky to the touch to slimy. Depending on its maturity, the cap shape may range from spherical to broadly convex. The cap diameter measures , and the cap cuticle can be peeled from the surface. The tubes are yellow, becoming olive-green with age, and they have an attachment to the stipe that ranges from adnate (with most of the tube fused to the stipe) to decurrent (with the tubes broadly attached, but running somewhat down the length of the stipe). They are typically up to deep, and there are about 1‚Äì2 tube mouths (pores) per millimeter. The pores are pale yellow, round, 1‚Äì2 mm wide, and do not change color when bruised. The stipe is white to pale yellow, dry, solid, not bruising, and pruinose (having a very fine whitish powder on the surface). A characteristic feature of many Suillus species are the glandular dots found on the stipe‚Äîclumps of hyphal cell ends through which the fungus secretes various metabolic wastes, leaving a sticky or resinous \\"dot\\". In S. brevipes, the form of the glandular dots is variable: they may be absent, slightly underdeveloped or obscurely formed with age. The stipe is usually short in comparison to the diameter of the cap, typically long and thick. It is either of equal width throughout, or may taper downwards; its surface bears minute puncture holes at maturity, and is it slightly fibrous at the base. Collections made in New Zealand tend to have a reddish coloration at the very base of the stipe. The flesh of the mushroom is initially white, but turns pale yellow in age. The odor and taste are mild. The spore print is cinnamon-brown. Microscopic characteristics The spores are elliptical to oblong, smooth, and have dimensions of 7‚Äì10 by 3‚Äì4 ¬µm. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are thin- walled, club-shaped to roughly cylindrical, and measure 2‚Äì25 by 5‚Äì7 ¬µm. They bear either two or four spores. The pleurocystidia (cystidia that are found on the face of a gill) are roughly cylindrical with rounded ends, thin-walled, and 40‚Äì55 by 5‚Äì8 ¬µm. The cells often have brown contents, and in the presence of 2% potassium hydroxide (KOH) will appear hyaline (translucent) or vinaceous (red wine-colored); in Melzer's reagent they become pale yellow or brown. The cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the edge of a gill) are 30‚Äì60 by 7‚Äì10 ¬µm, club-shaped to almost cylindrical, thin-walled, with brown incrusting material at the base, and arranged like a bundle of fibers. In KOH they appear hyaline, and are pale yellow in Melzer's reagent. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe) are 60‚Äì90 by 7‚Äì9 ¬µm, mostly cylindrical with rounded ends, and arranged in bundles with brown pigment particles at the base. The caulocystidia stain vinaceous in KOH. The cuticle of the cap is made of a layer of interwoven gelatinous hyphae that are individually 2‚Äì5 ¬µm thick; the gelatinous hyphae are responsible for the sliminess of the cuticle. There are no clamp connections in the hyphae. Edibility Sources recommend peeling off the slimy cap cuticle before eating the mushroom. Like many species of the genus Suillus, S. brevipes is edible, and the mushroom is considered choice by some. The odor is mild, and the taste mild or slightly acidic. Field guides typically recommended to remove the slimy cap cuticle, and, in older specimens, the tube layer before consumption. The mushrooms are common in the diet of grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park. The fatty acid composition of S. brevipes fruit bodies has been analyzed. The cap contained a higher lipid content than the stipe‚Äî18.4% of the dry weight, compared to 12.4%. In the cap, linoleic acid made up 50.7% of the total lipids (65.7% in the stipe), oleic acid was 29.9% (12.4% in the stipe), followed by palmitic acid at 10.5% (12.6% in the stipe). Linoleic acid‚Äîa member of the group of essential fatty acids called omega-6 fatty acids‚Äîis an essential dietary requirement for humans. Similar species Several Suillus species which grow under pines could be confused with S. brevipes. S. granulatus has a longer stipe, and distinct raised granules on the stipe. S. brevipes is differentiated from S. albidipes by not having a cottony roll of velar tissue (derived from a partial veil) at the margin when young. S. pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S. albivelatus has a veil. S. pungens has a characteristic pungent odor, compared to the mild smell of S. brevipes, and like S. granulatus, has glandular dots on the stipe. Ecology S. brevipes appears early in the succession of mycorrhizal fungi during the regrowth of pine after wildfire. Suillus brevipes is a mycorrhizal fungus, and it develops a close symbiotic association with the roots of various tree species, especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus can supply the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially lodgepole and ponderosa pine. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus has been shown to form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole, loblolly, eastern white, patula, pond, radiata, and red pines. In vitro mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry, western larch, Sitka spruce, and coast Douglas-fir. Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350 ppm), lead (200 ppm), and nickel (20 ppm). During the regrowth of pine trees after disturbance like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species is replaced by another. A study on the ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following wildfire concluded that S. brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout the life of the tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S. brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable for a period of time following disturbance. Habitat and distribution Suillus brevipes grows singly, scattered, or in groups on the ground in late summer and autumn. A common‚Äîand sometimes abundant‚Äîmushroom, it occurs over most of North America (including Hawaii), south to Mexico, and north to Canada. This species has been found in Puerto Rico growing under planted Pinus caribaea, where it is thought to have been introduced inadvertently from North Carolina by the USDA Forest Service in 1955. Other introductions have also occurred in exotic pine plantations in Argentina, India, New Zealand, Japan, and Taiwan.

It is characterized by the distinctive reddish-brown tufted fibers or small scales on the cap, and the presence of a woolly veil on the stem. The caps can reach diameters of up to , while the stems are between long and usually thick. On the underside of the cap is a layer of spongy yellow to yellow-brown angular pores; these pores are covered with a whitish partial veil when young. A mycorrhizal fungus, S. lakei grows in association with Douglas fir, and is found where this tree occurs. It is native to northwestern North America, but has been introduced to Europe, South America, and New Zealand. The mushroom is edible, but opinions vary considerably as to its quality. Taxonomy and naming American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill originally named the species Boletinus lakei after mycologist E.R. Lake of Oregon Agricultural college (now Oregon State University). Lake collected the type specimen from Corvallis, Oregon, in late November, 1907. Rolf Singer later transferred the species to the genera Ixocomus and Boletinus in 1940 and 1945, respectively. In their 1964 monograph on North American Suillus species, Alexander H. Smith and Harry Delbert Thiers transferred the species to Suillus. Simultaneously, they described the S. lakei variety pseudopictus that they said had been misidentified by collectors as Suillus pictus (now called Suillus spraguei) because of its reddish and scaly cap. Singer considered Suillus amabilis to be the same species as S. lakei, but Smith and Thiers later examined the type material of both, and concluded that they were distinct species. Engel and colleagues described a variety in 1996, S. lakei var. landkammeri, based on Boletinus tridentinus subsp. landkammeri described by Czech mycologists Albert Pil√°t and Mirko Svrƒçek in 1949. The nomenclatural databases Index Fungorum and MycoBank consider this synonymous with S. lakei. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"western painted Suillus\\", the \\"matte Jack\\", or \\"Lake's slippery cap\\". Description The pore surface of a young specimen The cap of S. lakei is up to in diameter and initially convex, but flattens out somewhat in maturity. The cap is fleshy, dry, yellowish to reddish-brown but fades with age. It is covered with pressed-down hairs or minute tufted scales in the center, with the yellowish flesh visible between the scales. Heavy rain can wash the fibrils off the cap surface, leaving a sticky, glutinous layer behind. Older specimens may be nearly smooth in age. Remnants of the partial veil sometimes hang from the edge of the cap. The cap margin is initially curved or rolled inwards, but unrolls as it grows and in maturity may be curled upward. Variety pseudopictus has red cap and prominent scales. The tubes that comprise the pore surface on the underside of the cap are deep; the angular pores are up to 2.5 mm wide and radially arranged. The pores range in color from yellow to brownish-yellow to ochre, and stain brownish or reddish- brown when bruised. They are covered by a partial veil in young specimens. The flesh is thick, yellow, and either unchanged in color when bruised or broken, or turns pinkish-red. The stem is long and usually thick, yellow sometimes with reddish streaks, and solid and yellow within. The species usually lacks the glandular dots on the stem that are characteristic of some Suillus species. The stem is either equal in width throughout its length, or tapered downwards. The tissue of the stem base may weakly stain bluish-green when cut, although this reaction is not usually apparent in mature specimens. The ring is delicate and floccose (resembling woolly tufts), and soon disappears or leaves a thin whitish ring on the stem. The spore print is cinnamon to brown in color. The variety calabrus, found in Italy, has a light yellow cap and purple-red scales. Variety pseudopictus has a cap that is redder and more scaly than the more common form. The spores are spindle-shaped to elliptical, have a smooth surface, and dimensions of 8‚Äì11 to 3‚Äì4 ¬µm. There are both two- and four-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), and they are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 28‚Äì36 by 10‚Äì12 ¬µm. Cystidia are plentiful, and are found in bundles lined along the tube mouths (as cheilocystidia), or more commonly, singly along the sides of the tubes (as pleurocystidia). These structures are thin-walled, cylindrical, and measure 48‚Äì60 by 7‚Äì9 ¬µm. The scales on the cap surface comprise more or less erect hyphae with tips that are clustered together. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae. Edibility Suillus lakei is edible, although opinions vary considerably as to its quality. It has been called \\"choice\\", as well as \\"rather coarse and tasteless\\" or \\"mediocre\\". Laboratory tests indicate the fruit bodies to have antimicrobial activity, and contain alkaloids and tannins. Similar species Mushrooms with an appearance similar to S. lakei can often be distinguished by their associations with trees. For example, the eastern North American species S. spraguei grows in association with Eastern White Pine. The cap of S. spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background. S. cavipes and S. ochraceoroseus always grow with Larch. S. ponderosus, which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil. Smith and Thiers note that it is difficult to tell the difference between the two if S. ponderosus has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them. S. decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. S. caerulescens is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured. Habitat and distribution Suillus lakei is indigenous to the Rocky Mountains and western parts of North America. Its range extends south into Mexico. Fruit bodies grow solitarily or in groups on the ground in young conifer stands or grassy parkland. Fruiting occurs in the late summer and autumn. Suillus lakei forms ectomycorrhizae with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and its distribution coincides with this tree. It is one of the most common bolete species found in northwestern Montana and Idaho. In a study of host specificity in pure culture in the laboratory, S. lakei failed to form healthy ectomycorrhizas with Eucalyptus roots‚Äîthe hyphae were covered in mucilage-like deposits and appeared to be collapsed. It has also been noted to prefer poor, exposed soil such as that found on road banks and campgrounds. It can often be found with the mushroom Gomphidius subroseus, another species that associates with Douglas fir. Both Douglas fir and Suillus lakei are non-native introduced species in Europe. The fungus has been found in several central and south European countries following the intentional introduction of Douglas fir. These include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Slovakia. It is considered endangered in the Czech Republic. Suillus lakei has also been reported in the South Island of New Zealand, and South America (Argentina and Chile).

Background  The Mahdist force, under Osman Digna, had advanced on Suakin with an intention to invest it. From Suakin, General Grenfell launched a sortie against the Mahdists, who were attempting to capture the Water Forts. After one and a half hours of fighting, the casualties were 12 on the Anglo- Egyptian side and 1,000 on the side of the Mahdists. After this, the Mahdists withdrew, removing any threat to Suakin.

He was well known in The Bowery and Five Points districts, owning a number of popular establishments throughout the city, most notably McGlory's Armory Hall, a popular Bowery hangout for members of the underworld in the old Fourth and Sixth Wards. Biography Early life and criminal career Reports of Billy McGlory's early life differ. Popular legend has it that he was born in the slums of the Five Points and grew up in an atmosphere of vice and crime, prior to the reform efforts of Reverend Lewis Pease and the Five Points House of Industry during the mid-1850s, however in his day he was reported to have been born and raised in the Sixteenth Ward (bounded by West 14th Street, the Hudson River, West 26th Street and Sixth Avenue), specifically on 16th Street between 6th and Seventh Avenues, by respectable Irish parents. Billy's half- brother by his mother's first marriage, Johnny Thompson, was a well-known Bowery actor. It is likely that as a young man he was a member of both the Forty Thieves and the Chichesters.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 170-172, 229, 298) Former New York City Chief of Police George W. Walling described him in his memoirs as \\"a man out of whom forty devils might be cast were it possible to get at him.\\"Walling, George W.

(pg. 191, 194-198, 199, 202, 204, 290, 334, 343) One of the first saloons he ever opened, known as the Burnt Rag, was located in the basement of 50 Bleecker Street. Only 200 feet away from police headquarters, the so-called \\"notorious thieves' den\\" was subject to frequent police raids. In 1878, he operated Eagle Hall, also known as the Burnt Rag at 6 Rivington Street. By September 1878, he was running another drinking place known as Burnt Rag No. 2, or the Windsor Palace, out of 103 Bowery, formerly occupied by Owen Geoghegan. Geoghegan relocated his saloon to 105 Bowery that same year. McGlory's Armory Hall McGlory opened McGlory's Armory Hall, located at 158 Hester Street,Moss, Frank. The American Metropolis from Knickerbocker Days to the Present Time. London: The Authors' Syndicate, 1897. (pg. 201) in the late 1870s. It was described by a journalist for the Cincinnati Inquirer as having \\"a beastliness and depravity... compared with which no chapter in the world's history is equal.\\" It very quickly became a popular underworld resort, frequented by thieves, pickpockets, and procurers throughout the old Fourth and Sixth Wards for nearly two decades. Armory Hall was often the scene of barroom brawls and gang violence. Drunken customers were robbed, many times by the female regulars who flirted with the victim beforehand, and then dragged from a table by a bouncer and thrown out into the street. Once outside, the victim would be searched by for anything of value and was usually stripped of his clothes.Lardner, James and Thomas Reppetto. NYPD: A City and Its Police. New York: Henry Holt & Co., 2000. (pg. 93) Batterberry, Michael. On the Town in New York: The Landmark History of Eating, Drinking, and Entertainments from the American Revolution to the Food Revolution. New York: Routledge, 1998. (pg. 104) Many of the much feared bouncers of McGlory's Armory Hall were well-known criminals and hired thugs of the Five Points and the New York waterfront. These men were described as \\"some of the most expert rough-and- tumble fighters of the period\\" and could be seen walking the club freely wearing pistols, knives, brass knuckles, and bludgeons which they often used against unruly or otherwise uncooperative customers. Armory Hall was entered from the street through a double doorway, which led into a long, narrow passageway with its walls pained \\"dead black\\". Fifty feet down the unlighted passage was the barroom and from there the main dance hall, furnished with chairs and tables, which accommodated up to 700 people. The music played in the dance hall included a piano, a cornet and a violin. A balcony ran around two sides of the hall with small box seats, some containing secret compartments, separated by heavy curtains reserved for wealthy patrons. These were usually out-of-towners who were known as big spenders in the city's many resorts and clubs. Private exhibitions were held in these boxes \\"even more degraded then the Haymarket\\" and McGlory, as an added attraction, employed half a dozen young males as waitresses \\"dressed in feminine clothing and circulated through the crowd, singing and dancing.\\" They were \\"painted like women\\" and spoke in high, falsetto voices. As well as the many prostitutes and \\"serving girls\\" working in the dance hall, the concert saloon was widely known for encouraging homosexual activity among its patrons.Gilfoyle, Timothy J. City of Eros: New York City, Prostitution, and the Commercialization of Sex, 1790-1920. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1994. (pg. 229, 231) McGlory also held athletic events at Armory Hall and charged 15 cents to attend these promotions. In 1883, his Grand Scarlet Ball included a cakewalk, mixed boxing matches, a beauty contest and a masquerade ball.Gems, Gerald R., Linda J. Borish and Gertrud Pfister. Sports in American History: From Colonization to Globalization. Champaign, Illinois: Human Kinetics, 2008. (pg. 156) In January 1879, McGlory was indicted for running a disorderly house. When he failed to show up in court the following month, his bail was forfeited but no further action was taken. It was the robbery of a contractor, Bernard Lee, and others that prompted District Attorney John McKeon to search for untried indictments against McGlory. He found three and took them to Recorder Frederick Smythe who then ordered McGlory to appear before the General Sessions court. Though McGlory's lawyer requested bail be set at $500, McKeon raised an objection which was supported by Recorder Smythe and raised to $1,000. As a result of this trial, McGlory spent time in The Tombs and thereafter in the penitentiary on Blackwell's Island. He was freed August 13, 1884. During the time of his trial and subsequent imprisonment, McGlory became a member of The Salvation Army and claimed to support the Temperance movement, however upon release from prison he said that he would not take up the temperance cause as he was an \\"awful example.\\" Close of the Armory and legal trouble McGlory gained considerable notoriety from the press, especially from the New York Herald, who titled him the \\"Vicar General.\\" He was one of several prominent figures, along with police officials, politicians, and sportsmen, who attended the bare-knuckle boxing prize fight between John L. Sullivan and Paddy Ryan at Madison Square Garden on January 19, 1885. Upon the election, reform Mayor Abram S. Hewitt, who promised to clean up the vice and red light districts in New York City, closed many of the famous resorts, including Harry Hill's, Frank Stephenson's Black and Tan, Theodore Allen's American Mabille and, in lower Manhattan, The Haymarket. Authorities finally attempted to close Armory Hall in 1889, although their efforts were initially met with some difficulty. In a meeting with Mayor Hugh J. Grant in February, McGlory claimed that he had been trying to rent the building out as a church but had been unable to find tenants. A month later, police visited Armory Hall and reported they had witnessed nothing obscene or improper, \\"not even a cancan.\\" McGlory sold the building to a furniture manufacturer soon after, auctioning off the bar, piano, icebox, and stage scenery in June 1889. A year later, McGlory bought the Hotel Irving, a respectable restaurant and boarding house in uptown Manhattan, and turned it into an all-night saloon and dance hall. The Hotel Irving was located on the corner of Fourteenth Street and Irving Place, across the street from the New York Academy of Music and nearby Tammany Hall and Tony Pastor's place. Complaints were made about the noise and violence but police did not take action until an expos√© by the New York Herald prompted city officials to take action. The hotel's liquor license was revoked in June but McGlory continued to sell alcohol even after his bartender, Edward Kelly, was arrested. District Attorney De Lancey Nicoll ordered McGlory's arrest and, in December 1891, he stood trial at the Court of General Sessions for running a disorderly house. At the trial, the Irving's manager Frederick Krause appeared as the state's witness and described how McGlory \\"muscled\\" his way into running the Irving despite his having no financial ties to it. Edward Corey, the former owner of the Haymarket, had legitimately purchased an interest in the hotel but was chased out by McGlory who threatened his life if he ever returned. In another incident, according to Krause, he himself was assaulted by McGlory when the hotel manager attempted to stop a suspicious looking couple from using one of the rooms. Other charges, aside from liquor law violations, were claimed by prostitute Nellie Martin, bookmaker Samuel Guggenheim, as well as additional witnesses who testified to other serious allegations. Final years Although McGlory's and a few other uptown resorts reopened in the aftermath of Mayor Hewitt's closures, none were able to regain their former prestige, and McGlory finally closed his last dance house in 1900. After aiding his wife Annie in a hearing by the New York Supreme Court, McGlory told reporters that he intended to leave New York and move out West. McGlory was arrested once more on the night of May 30, 1903, and charged with running a saloon called the Emerald on Third Avenue in the Bronx without a liquor license. He was tried at the Morrisania Court two days later and explained to Judge Mayo that he had applied for a hotel license instead of a regular liquor license and hadn't intended to violate the law. The arresting detectives told the court they had arrested him because the brewery had taken away the establishment's license. Bail was set at but McGlory was unable to pay it and he was taken to Harlem Prison to await trial. He met a young man while in prison, Warren Adams, who was being held for public drunkenness. Adams had traveled from Boston to attend a funeral and was arrested after he'd had a few too many drinks. Judge Mayo had sentenced him to prison in default of a fine that Adams was unable to pay being only a dollar short. McGlory offered to pay the spare dollar. When Adams promised to mail him back the money from Boston, McGlory replied \\"Well, if you do it will be the first dollar that ever came back to me.\\" The Oregon Daily Journal reported in 1912 that McGlory was \\"passing into a preaceful old age in a little cottage on the banks of the [East] river,\\" however he was being threatened with expulsion from his home at East 125th Street by his landlord, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, who wanted to build a dock there. It is unknown when Billy McGlory died, however it is possible that he is the William J. McGrory that is recorded as passing away at age 70 in the Bronx on December 26, 1928. At least one writer thought he was dead before 1917 and a newspaper from 1929 refers to him as the \\"late Billy McGlory.\\" References Further reading * Costello, Augustine E.

Viewed as an agent provocateur of the secret police, he was hated and boycotted by the Moscow intelligentsia.  Biography  Born ' () in Moscow, he changed his name to Victor Louis in the 1950s, when he began writing for the Western press. His Russian mother died a week of his birth; his father came from a well-off (prior to the 1917 revolution) German (Prussian) family that lived in Moscow.Kevorkov, Vyacheslav (2010), p. 12-15 Starting from 1944, Lui managed to land a series of low-level support staff positions with foreign embassies in Moscow, which got him into trouble with the NKVD; he was arrested in Leningrad around 1946 and later tried and sentenced to 25 years of labour camps on espionage charges (Article 58).Kevorkov, Vyacheslav (2010), p. 35, 65 He did time in Inta. He was released around 1956 and started co-operating closely with the KGB. His first official employment was with the CBS News Moscow bureau,Kevorkov, Vyacheslav (2010), p. 121-122 where, as his own account has it, he gave his boss, Daniel Schorr, a tip, allegedly based on an article in that reported the cancellation of a Hungarian ballet trip to Moscow,Kevorkov, Vyacheslav (2010), p. 122-123 about the imminent Soviet invasion of Hungary in November 1956. His next job was as an assistant to Edmund Stevens of Look magazine.Kevorkov, Vyacheslav (2010), p. 123 Louis wrote for The Evening News until 1980, and then for the Sunday Express. As he would have news nobody else had, occasionally he made world headlines. As a journalist and a source of information for other foreign correspondents in the USSR, he was considered to purvey the western world with information that the Soviet r√©gime would consider interesting to deliver, without committing itself to it. His first sensational journalistic scoop was breaking the news through The Evening News‚Äîalbeit cautiously worded‚Äîabout the imminent ouster of Krushchev in October 1964. In his autobiographical accounts, Louis claimed that the report was based solely on his analysis of circumstantial evidence such as the disappearance of a big portrait of Khrushchev in the centre of Moscow and Khrushchev's name being expunged from Soviet media news reports,Kevorkov, Vyacheslav (2010), p. 142-156 even though he admitted that the initial hint had been given to him by his \\"friend\\" who worked at the USSR Broadcasting Committee ().Kevorkov, Vyacheslav (2010), p. 142-143 According to his own account, Louis had a series of personal meetings with the KGB chairman Yuri Andropov from the late 1960s till the mid-1970s.Kevorkov, Vyacheslav (2010), p. 207 Louis claimed that Andropov personally gave him the go-ahead when, having overheard Andropov's telephone conversation with Leonid Brezhnev, he volunteered to go to Chile in the wake of the military junta's in the autumn of 1973 to ascertain that Luis Corval√°n, the general secretary of the Communist Party of Chile, was alive.Kevorkov, Vyacheslav (2010), p. 320-321 Louis reported that the Soviet Union might be considering a preventive nuclear attack against China as well as the information about the Moscow metro bombing of 1977; he ascribed the latter to dissidents, which gave the authorities a pretext for a harsh crackdown. In 1968, a few months before the publication of Twenty Letters to a Friend by Joseph Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva (who had defected two years prior), Louis brought out the KGB's unauthorized copy in Germany to damp the sensation. He was instrumental in smuggling both Khrushchev's memoirs and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Ward to the West, although in the latter case he is believed to have had the aim of compromising the writer at home. He had an opulent dacha at Bakovka west of Moscow, \\"where he lived like a millionaire\\"; he also had a series of expensive cars, including the makes of Porsche, Bentley and Mercedes-Benz, some of them vintage. From 1965, he and his wife ran a lucrative 'hard-currency' business publishing the directory Information Moscow for foreigners in Moscow. Until 1982, Louis' KGB overseer was KGB Major General Vyacheslav Kevorkov, who in 2010 published a book in Russia about Victor Louis' life that he claimed was based on the latter's oral accounts to him shortly before death. According to Kevorkov's 2010 interview, he would normally meet Louis at safe houses (never at the KGB headquarters at Lubyanka) and give him assignments directly from Yuri Andropov; Kevorkov claimed that Louis never was a KGB officer, or a staff agent. He also noted that Louis was not good at writing in any language and his articles were edited by his English wife. The book, Victor Louis : Man with the Legend (), is written in first person as a quasi-biography (on behalf of Louis), in a fictional style, without reference to any documents. He died of a heart attack in London on 18 July 1992, a few months after the demise of the USSR; his cremated remains were interred in the Moscow Vagankovo Cemetery.Gravesite photo http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/sergey_v_fomin/72076302/652574/652574_600.jpg He was survived by his wife (since November 1958) ‚Äì UK-born Jennifer Margaret, Statham, a former nanny to a diplomat at the British Embassy in MoscowBlazes Along a Diplomatic Trail By J.

He also published short stories under the names Grant Doyle Cooper and James Linnel. He was born in Claremont, Tasmania to a well-connected Lindisfarne family but was more interested in an adventurous outback life than one of business and politics. From 1917 he was to make frequent forays into the Western Australian bush to experience first-hand life in the bush and deserts of outback Australia. His experience of aboriginal life was augmented by reading the works of anthropologist Baldwin Spencer. He was already a successful contributor of short stories to overseas magazines in 1931 when he wrote his first novel, Tybal Men, set in a WA sheep station. He is regarded as giving a realistic depiction of bush life and aboriginal culture, though criticised for emulating the \\"violent excesses of the American cowboy novel\\".Sydney Morning Herald 24 November 1933 His brother Don (Donald Manners Thirkell) Norman (24 April 1909 - 10 March 2001) was a writer (e.g. Errol Flynn : the Tasmanian story W.N.

Background  Plaintiff John R. Stanton brought suit against the Baltic Mining Company, in which he owned stock, to enjoin (stop) the company from paying income tax imposed under the Revenue Act of 1913. Stanton argued that because the income tax contained no provision for depletion of a mine's ore, it was a direct tax on the mine's capital. As a direct tax, Stanton argued, it was invalid without meeting the apportionment requirement of Article I, Section 9, and was not covered by the Sixteenth Amendment. Stanton appealed from the district court's denial of the injunction.  Opinion of the Court  The U.S. Supreme Court noted that the case \\"was commenced by the appellant [John R. Stanton] as a stockholder of the Baltic Mining Company, the appellee, to enjoin the voluntary payment by the corporation and its officers of the tax assessed against it under the income tax section of the tariff act of October 3, 1913.\\" On a direct appeal from the trial court, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, and rejected Stanton's request for a court order to prevent Baltic Mining Company from paying the income tax. Stanton argued that the tax law was unconstitutional and void under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that the law denied \\"to mining companies and their stockholders equal protection of the laws and deprive[d] them of their property without due process of law.\\" The Supreme Court rejected that argument. Stanton also argued that the Sixteenth Amendment \\"authorizes only an exceptional direct income tax without apportionment, to which the tax in question does not conform\\" and that therefore the income tax was \\"not within the authority of that Amendment.\\" The Court also rejected this argument and upheld the constitutionality of the income tax under the 1913 Revenue Act.

Site history From 1951 until the late 1970s, the site was owned by a local businessman, Clayburn Robinette, who used it as a gravel pit and then as a landfill for non-methane-emitting waste (technically called a cold-fill). By the 1960s the site was known locally as \\"Mt Trashmore\\". When the landfill reached ground level, it was covered with concrete, brick and an eight-foot clay cap. The site, which had become a large hill in an otherwise flat area, was left unused and overgrown with vegetation until the late 1970s. At this time, a man named Mark Collor, who had grown up in River Forest and operated a water slide in suburban Kansas City, noticed it while driving along the highway, and became excited by its potential. \\"Try to find a hill in Chicago, it's a little hard,\\" Collor told the Chicago Tribune in 2009. \\"My friend and I saw that hill with that sign on top of it for The Flame restaurant, and I said, 'There's a hill!'\\" Collor signed an agreement with the Robinette family to build two water slides and a few small buildings on the property. The park's tongue-twister name came about because Collor had been amused by a story his brother-in-law had told about meeting a man in Joplin, Mo., named Ebenezer Floppen. Operation history When the park first opened on July 5, 1980, it had only two simple, 800-foot concrete water slides. People slid down on rubber mats in groups of up to eight at a time. The mats were colour-coded to manage the flow of crowds through the slides: for instance, patrons carrying red mats entered the slides at noon and came out at 12:30, while those with blue mats entered at 12:30 and left at 1pm. The water park had paid for its installation costs by 5 August 1980, and became a major summer attraction for residents of surrounding towns and communities as people lined up for rides down the large winding slides. After two years, Collor sold the park to a businessman he knew from Oak Park and River Forest High School. During the 1980s, the park added five additional slides. The new slides included: two flat racer slides in which people slid down head-first on folded rubber mats; two semi-enclosed tube body slides; and a smaller slide in which patrons rode inner tubes into a nearby wading pool. The slides were also unique in that they were lined with a blue rubber foam material which would prevent injuries from contacts with the slide walls. Due to the design of the two main large concrete slides, especially with the V-shaped configuration of their side walls, people could also slide quite high up the walls of the slides, especially when hitting a turn at high speeds. Around 1987, the large concrete slides were resurfaced with flat bottoms with humps and bumps. Patrons rode the slides solo on inner tubes, getting bumped up and down and sideways as they went down the renovated slides. To fit the new rides, the park was renamed \\"Doc River's Roaring Rapids Water Park.\\" Closure and rumours The park closed for good at the end of the 1989 season for unknown reasons. Neglected and abandoned since, the slides and wading pool have fallen into ruin. The site has become popular with urban explorers, and the mystery surrounding its closure has given rise to online speculation that park patrons had been injured or killed. \\"It closed somewhere around 1989 because a teenager was going down a slide and flew off of the side,\\" Flickr user gotnataliex3 claimed. \\"Once he died, no one really wanted to come back and it later closed. I'm pretty sure it was due to lawsuits.\\" \\"I read some kid got killed going down the speed sides [sic], the one he walked down in one of the videos,\\" YouTube user Anthony Koyer commented. \\"I guess when the kid got to the end, he kept going and messed himself up on the side walk that was at the bottom, right after the small area you are should have slowed down and stopped! I guess he kept going. I used to glide it to the end myself, but would hook my legs at the edge so I would stop before hitting the side walk, I guess that kid did not. This caused the down slide of the place.\\" \\"Rumor has it that the park was closed down due to water filtration issues, along with the zoning board deeming that because the park was located atop a landfill it was originally an oversight,\\" YouTube user Mark Palmer commented. \\"That's what I recall from the time.\\" Meanwhile, on an online discussion forum for Villa Park locals, Jack Steen argued the park had closed \\"because the toxic waste buried only slightly below the ground and covered with the thin layer of almost-cement was LEAKING AND BURNING THE SKIN OF THE CHILDREN WHO WERE USING THE PLACE FOR RECREATION.\\" There is no evidence for these claims, which are likely to be urban legends. However as of December 2018, the park is listed on the website of a law firm specialising in amusement park injuries, which claims: \\"We have successfully gone up against all major water parks in the United States including, but not limited to [this park]\\". As a ruin The site is still owned by the Robinette family, which operates a nearby demolition business. There are security cameras, signs warning against trespassing, a roadblock on a road that leads to the park, and a permanent chain-link fence has been erected around the site. None of this has deterred curious explorers. By July 2009, the two large concrete slides had numerous cracks and splits in the concrete that had sprouted saplings six to eight feet tall. At that time, the rubber foam lining had peeled off the slide walls and lay jumbled in the slides, the slide walls were covered with graffiti, and the slides were also filled with tree branches and dirt, especially about 150 feet above the plunge pool, where a retaining wall had recently collapsed and filled one of the slides to its rim with dirt and weeds. Both racers were cracked and peeled badly: surfacing was missing in a few spots filled with more weeds and overgrowth, the body slides were choked with leaves and branches, the smaller inner tube slide had numerous saplings sprouting from its base and was also badly split and cracked, and the wading pool was also cracked and full of weeds. Other retaining walls elsewhere in the park that once held elevated gardens continued to sag severely in July 2009. As of April 2019, the only remnants of the water park that can be seen from Route 83 are some lights that illuminated the water park. A big red billboard that says ‚ÄúAdvertise Here‚Äù can be seen at the top the hill.

Gresford Colliery was a coal mine located a mile from the North Wales village of Gresford, near Wrexham. History Sinking The North Wales Coalfield, of which Gresford was part, runs from Point of Ayr, on the Flintshire coast to the Shropshire border. Although coal mining records date back to the 15th century, it was not heavily exploited until the 18th century. By 1900, more than 12,500 miners produced three million tonnes a year. Industrialist Henry Dennis of Ruabon, and his son Henry Dyke Dennis, began the colliery near Gresford in 1907. The site was on the edge of the Alyn Valley, between the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway (later the Great Western Railway's Birkenhead to London Paddington line), and the old main road between Wrexham and Chester. The Dennis' company United Westminster & Wrexham Collieries took four years to sink two deep shafts, the Dennis (downcast) and the Martin (upcast), located apart. It was one of the deepest coal mines in the Denbighshire coalfield, the Dennis shaft reaching a depth of about and the Martin shaft about . Operations The first coal was produced in June, 1911 and full production reached before the outbreak of World War I. Three seams were worked: the Crank, the Brassey (named after engineer Thomas Brassey), and the Main. House coal was produced from the Crank seam, the Brassey seam was virtually gas free whilst the Main seam was very gaseous. Working conditions at the colliery were dusty, and very hot, the temperature often more than . The Dennis section was divided into six districts: the 20s, 61's, 109's, 14's and 29's districts, along with a very deep district known as \\"95's and 24's\\".Gresford Colliery Explosion, Hansard, 23-02-37 These districts were worked by the longwall system but the 20's and 61's, which were furthest from the shaft, were worked by hand when the remaining districts were mechanised. The coal was renowned as being of very good quality and hot burning. In 1934, 2,200 men were employed at the colliery, with 1,850 working underground and 350 on the surface. Strike, mechanisation and profitability The government passed the Coal Mines Act 1911 requiring every new colliery to have two intake airways into the mine, to allow air to circulate in the workings and only one air intake be allowed for the movement of coal. Gresford Colliery was in operation before the law came into force and was exempt. Retro digging a new shaft made little commercial sense, and not much profit had ever came out of the pit, so the Dennis didn't undertake the work. After the General Strike, cost-cutting measures were introduced in all mines, including in safety provision. Five local collieries - Westminster, Wrexham & Acton, Vauxhall and Gatewen - shut in quick succession during the 1920s and 1930s. Mechanisation, believed by the workers and unions to improve working conditions, created more dust and explosions, in an economic climate where the government were reluctant to enforce regulation. By 1934, there were two main sections to Gresford Colliery, the Dennis and the South-east, which were both part mechanised. 2,200 miners worked in three eight-hour shifts. Some miners worked double shifts to earn extra money despite it being illegal. The Dennis family owned a residual 45% stake in the colliery, and wanting additional profitability put manager, William Bonsall, under pressure to increase the productivity of the whole colliery. Accident One of Britain's worst coal mining disasters occurred at the colliery. The Gresford Disaster occurred on Saturday 22 September 1934, when 266 men died following an underground explosion. As there was a football match on the Saturday afternoon between Wrexham and Tranmere Rovers, on Friday, 21 September, many miners doubled up their shifts so they could attend the match. This meant there were more miners down the pit than there ordinarily would have been. The explosion occurred in the Dennis district at around 2am, the time when the men would be having their mid-shift snack. Only six men survived the blast. A fire followed the explosion, and the mine was sealed off at the end of the following day. On 25 September, rescuer George Brown was killed on the surface when another explosion blew a seal off the Dennis shaft and he was hit by flying debris. Only eleven bodies were ever recovered. The mine owners docked the men half a day's pay, as they had not completed a full day's shift. Investigation Sir Henry Walker, the Chief Inspector of Mines, chaired the inquiry which opened on 25 October 1934, at Church House, Regent Street, Wrexham. Walker was assisted by John Brass, for the mine owners; and Joseph Jones for the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). Both sides employed barristers, Hartley Shawcross for the owners; while the MFGB were offered pro bono publico the services of Labour MP and barrister Sir Stafford Cripps. Walker wanted access to the evidence, and although the pit was reopened in March, 1935, for safety reasons the Dennis section remained closed, and was eventually sealed. Having adjourned the inquiry in December, 1934, by December 1936, Walker legally had to make his final report. The report noted that before the accident ventilation in some districts was possibly inadequate: in particular, it was noted that 14's and 29's districts were poorly ventilated. The report after the accident, considered that the main return airway for the 109's, 14's and 29's districts was far too small at 4 feet by 4 (according to one witness).Report by Sir Henry Walker in Colliery Engineering, March 1937 Evidence was given that 95's and 24's district, at 2,600 feet deep, was uncomfortably hot. There were numerous breaches of regulations regarding the firing of explosive charges in 14's district, taking of dust samples, and other matters.At the inquiry a pit deputy (whose job was to oversee the safety of the workings) admitted that he carried out shotfiring during his shifts in addition to his other duties. It was revealed that he fired more charges during his shift than a full-time shotfirer could have safely carried out. The colliery had made an operating loss in 1933, and the manager, William Bonsall, had been under pressure from the Dennis family to increase profitability.Inquiry Failed to Heal the Wounds, Wrexham Chronicle, 30-09-04 He had spent little time in the Dennis section of the pit in the months before the disaster, as he was overseeing the installation of new machinery in the mine's other section, the South-Eastern or Slant. Subsequent to the accident a number of theories were advanced in the Report as to the explosion's exact cause: Sir Stafford Cripps, the miners' legal representative, suggested that an explosion had been triggered in 95's by shotfiring (the firing of explosive charges) near a main airway. The miners' appointed Assessor also surmised that a large quantity of gas had accumulated at the top of the face in 14's district, which was then ignited by an accident with a safety lamp or by a spark from a coalcutter. The legal representatives of the pit's management, however, suggested that firedamp had accumulated in the main Dennis haulage road beyond the Clutch (a junction on the main drift where the underground haulage machinery was located) and which was ignited at the Clutch when a telephone was used to warn miners of the influx of gas.Report by Sir Henry Walker in Colliery Engineering, March 1937 This interpretation sought to deny that poor working practices were the ultimate cause of the disaster. After the report was presented to parliament in January 1937, in April 1937, at Wrexham Petty Sessions, 42 charges were made against the colliery company, the manager and officials. Most were withdrawn or dismissed, but manager William Bonsall was convicted on eight counts of breaking mining safety law, and fined ¬£140 with ¬£350 costs. Gresford Colliery Disaster Relief Fund The national and local newspapers focused on stories of heroism and bereavement, with speculation about who was at fault, or what caused the disaster left alone. The disaster left 591 widows, children, parents and other dependants. In addition, over 1500 miners were temporarily without work, until the colliery was re-opened in January 1936. After each newspaper opened its own fund, they and national donations by September 1935 totalled ¬£565,000. The sum was divided equally split between the Lord Mayor of London's \\"Mansion House Fund\\" and the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire's \\"Denbighshire Fund.\\" The local committee which met in Wrexham took monies from both funds, and appointed a visitor to ensure that immediate relief was distributed in the form of grants and temporary weekly allowances. The two funds were amalgamated in July 1935, under the provision of a trust deed to form the Gresford Colliery Disaster Relief Fund, with three trustees: the Lord Mayor of London, the Governor of the Bank of England and the Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire. They devolved power to a local administration committee, who paid monies via an honorary actuary. The fund was wound up after the deaths of the last dependants, and donated residual monies to the creation of the memorial to the victims unveiled in 1982. After the accident The mine remained sealed off for six months after the explosion. Districts of the mine were gradually reopened, although the Dennis district, where the explosion occurred remained sealed. Coal production restarted in January 1936, and by 1945 there were 1,743 men employed. Gresford was officially closed on 10 November 1973 due to a combination of exhaustion of existing coal reserves and geological problems. In memoriam To this day, Wrexham Library has the memorial book on display with a list of the poor souls still buried underground. There is also a painting in All Saint's church, Gresford, depicting scenes from the disaster and rescue. Nine years after the closure of the pit, in 1982 the head gear wheel was preserved as part of the Gresford Disaster Memorial. It was dedicated on 26 November 1982, in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the surviving relatives of those miners killed in the disaster. In 2000, as a final act of remembrance, the names of all those who lost their lives in the pit were added to the memorial. On the 75th anniversary in 2009, various memorials took place, including Wrexham Football Club delaying their match by 15 minutes - as they would normally have done in the days when the mine was working.

This fort can be visited in a day from Nashik. This fort is located on the busy Nashik-Vapi Route. History Ramsej fort saw the war against Mughal Empire for six and a half years. The first killedar (fort commander) was Suryaji Jadhav, but after five and a half years he was transferred and a new killedar was appointed as per the rotation of posts policy of Maratha empire. In 1682 Aurangzeb sent Sahabuddin Khan to conquer the fort. Shahbuddin Khan had vowed to capture the fort with his 40,000 army and strong artillery within a few hours. But the 600 Maratha soldiers on the fort kept his forces at bay for many months by fierce array of slingshots, lit haystack and huge stones even though they did not have cannons on the fort. Once the Mughal artillery managed to break the fort walls in the evening and they assumed that the fort will be captured easily. But all 600 Marathas on the fort worked for a full night and rebuilt the entire broken section of the wall, much to the despair and awe of the Mughals. Such fierce resistance made the Mughal soldiers believe that the Marathas on the fort knew black magic. The inability of Mughal Sardar to capture the fort started frustrating Aurangzeb. He raised a wooden platform to storm the fort. Marathas were very smart in the fact that Shivaji and his son Sambhaji had a policy of keeping enough ammunition even on the forts having no cannons or guns. Ramshej was no exception and even though it did not have cannons it had sufficient ammunition. The fort commander had an idea and utilised amply available animal skin and wood on the fort to make wooden cannons. Coupled with the ammunition already present on the fort these wooden cannons started inflicting heavy losses on mughal army. The retaliation from the Marathas was so strong that he left the responsibility to Bahadurkhan and went to Junnar. Bahadurkhan also tried to capture the fort by fooling Marathas into believing that the Mughals were preparing for a full fledged frontal assault. While his real plan was send 200 of his best troops from the rear side of the fort by climbing the steep cliff. The Maratha commander was aware of the fact and allowed these 200 soldiers to climb the rope. Once they had climbed up the rope, he cut the rope as a result of which 200 of the best mughal soldiers fell and died in the valley. Bahadurkhan was distraught and found that Marathas were receiving secret supplies from the nearby forts. He carefully blocked all the paths to nearby Maratha forts. There was dire shortage of food on the fort. Seeing this situation Maratha King Sambhaji acted quickly by sending his sardars Rupaji Bhosle and Manaji More with an 8,000 strong army and supplies. They tried to break through the Mughal line but we're unable to supply the fort. Sambhaji was in great worry that his fiercely brave warriors were fighting without food. But the luck supported the Marathas and due to severe bad weather Bahadurkhan relaxed his encirclement for one day enabling Rupaji and Manaji to supply the fort with supplies enough for 6 more months. Bahadurkhan then tried to win the fort with the help of a 'mantrik' as he believed that the Marathas had ghosts under their control. The Marathas again fooled him as the mantrik was himself a maratha soldier in disguise who led the Mughal army in a deadly ambush of the marathas. Bahadurkhan and Mughals fled the deadly ambush and several Mughals were killed in this surprise attack. Bahadurkhan was also unable to siege the fort, finally, he burnt the wooden platform and left the battle. Aurangzeb sent Kasim Khan Kirmani to lead the battlehttp://trekshitiz.com/trekshitiz/marathi/Ramshej-Trek-R-Alpha.html and it is said that the Mughals conquered Ramshej Fort by paying bribe to the new killedar. Ramsej was one of the forts which surrendered to British Army in 1818 after the fall of Trymbakgad fort.https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Nasik/022%20Places/001%20Place.htm#RamsejFort Captain Briggs describes that there were eight guns, 9 small cannons called jamburasand 21 jingals on the fort. Places to see The fort is located on a high tableland with escarpments on all the sides. There are good steps on the eastern side of the fort which lead to the entrance gate. There is a temple of Lord Ram at the entrance of the fort. There is a water cistern near the temple holding potable water. On the eastern side of the fort is the main gate of the fort which is chiseled from the parent rock. There are many rock-cut water cisterns on the fort.

The Dos Leyendas show took place on March 21, 2008 in CMLL's main venue, Arena M√©xico, Mexico City, Mexico. The event was to honor and remember CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth, who died in March 1987. Starting in 1999 CMLL honored not just their founder during the show, but also a second lucha libre legend, making it their version of a Hall of Fame event. For the 2008 show CMLL commemorated the life and career of wrestler Black Shadow. This was the tenth March show held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas name, having previously been known as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth from 1996 to 1998. The main event of the Dos Leyendas show was fought under Lucha de Apuestas (\\"bet match\\") rules where the loser would have his head shaved bald. The match saw Perro Aguayo Jr. defeat H√©ctor Garza. After his loss, Garza stood in the center of the ring to have all his hair cut off. The show featured five further matches, all Six-man \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team match, one being an all-female match and one featuring CMLL's Mini-Estrella division. Production Background Since 1996 the Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a show in March each year to commemorate the passing of CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth who died in March 1987. For the first three years the show paid homage to Lutteroth himself, from 1999 through 2004 the show paid homage to Lutteroth and El Santo, Mexico's most famous wrestler ever and from 2005 forward the show has paid homage to Lutteroth and a different leyenda (\\"Legend\\") each year, celebrating the career and accomplishments of past CMLL stars. Originally billed as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth, it has been held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") since 1999 and is the only show outside of CMLL's Anniversary shows that CMLL has presented every year since its inception. All Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2008 show was the 13th overall Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show. Storylines The Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Homage to Salvador Lutteroth and Black Shadow In September 1933 Salvador Lutteroth Gonz√°lez founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), which would later be renamed Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Over time Lutteroth would become responsible for building both Arena Coliseo in Mexico City and Arena Mexico, which became known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". Over time EMLL became the oldest wrestling promotion in the world, with 2018 marking the 85th year of its existence. Lutteroth has often been credited with being the \\"father of Lucha Libre\\", introducing the concept of masked wrestlers to Mexico as well as the Luchas de Apuestas match. Lutteroth died on September 5, 1987. EMLL, late CMLL, remained under the ownership and control of the Lutteroth family as first Salvador's son Chavo Lutteroth and later his grandson Paco Alonso took over ownership of the company. The life and achievements of Salvador Lutteroth is always honored at the annual Homenaje a Dos Leyenda' show and since 1999 CMLL has also honored a second person, a Leyenda of lucha libre, in some ways CMLL's version of their Hall of Fame. For the 2008 show CMLL commemorated the life and career of wrestler and lucha film star Alejandro Cruz Ortiz, generally known under the ring name Black Shadow. Cruz's career started in 1942 and he did not fully retire until 1981. As Black Shadow, Cruz teamed up with Blue Demon, to form a very successfully and popular team known as Los Hermanos Shadow (\\"The Shadow Brothers\\"), although they were not related. The duo won the Mexican National Tag Team Championship once, but are best known for their long running feud with El Santo. The Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, between El Santo and Black Shadow in 1952 has been named one of the most important Lucha de Apuestas matches in Mexican history. He also started in several films, often alongside Blue Demon.

Life Denis Dighton was the son of the caricaturist Robert Dighton and a younger brother was Richard Dighton. He enrolled as a student of the Royal Academy in 1807 and exhibited 17 pictures there between 1811 and 1825. He enjoyed the patronage of the Prince of Wales, who had been a close friend of his mother. Through the influence of the prince, he received a commission in the army in 1811, however, he soon returned to civilian life. By 1814 he had received the title of Military Painter to H.R.H. the Prince Regent. The prince sent Dighton to the Southern Netherlands just before the Battle of Waterloo, and seems to have bought all his exhibited pictures. Dighton visited the Waterloo battlefield five days after the victory and executed nine paintings of the battle. He fell from royal favour when his intermediary with the Prince Regent, Sir Benjamin Bloomfield, lost his place in the royal household, to be replaced by Sir William Knighton. After this loss of patronage, Dighton became mentally ill; he moved with his wife and son to Brittany, where he lived supported by the Artists' Benevolent Fund until his death at the age of 35 on 8 August 1827. Dighton is mostly known for his paintings of battle scenes especially depicting the Peninsular War and Waterloo; he also painted a scene of Nelson being shot at the Battle of Trafalgar.

The fierce competition in the textile industry caused many factories to go bankrupt, close or move their businesses elsewhere. Hardick & Seckel was combined with a number of other factories which were bought by the municipality of Enschede. The property continued to be used by local companies for many years until it was allowed to stand largely empty. In 1984 a new lease through an initiative of a few municipal officials saw the renovation of the site for use as a \\"business centre\\". The building was renovated and adapted to the modern requirements, financially supported by the European Union. The Hardick & Seckel complex consisted of three main buildings. The buildings were divided into several business units, offices and storage units. From 1985 to 1987 the company operated at a loss but the following 20 years it operated profitably. This continued until May 2006 with help from the Entrepreneurs Foundation Centers Enschede (SOCE). In 1997 the Enschede municipality initiated a plan to close Hardick & Seckel. The entrepreneurs were not part of that plan and were to be removed from the area. After resistance by the incumbent operators in the building, by the council and the college, a final agreement reached in 1998 meant Hardick & Seckel remained there as a business centre. It was a long road to keep the business complex open, but the buildings proved popular. Eventually in 2001 the alterations and adjustments were completed. Hardick & Seckel proved to still be in the attention of the municipality of Enschede. By the end of 2006, the complex, together with the surrounding plots (a total business area of 5 hectares) was brought into disrepute again. There was talk of a loss of ‚Ç¨250,000 per year. For that reason, Hardick & Seckel closed. In 2003 the companies occupying the space were operating profitably, but after the introduction of the Rent System companies found it hard to continue. The area is to be demolished in the last quarter of 2009 for redevelopment.

The proposed revision was approved in 1927 by the Church Assembly but rejected by Parliament. Its authorisation was defeated in the House of Commons for a second time on 14 June 1928. In order to reduce conflict with traditionalists, it was decided that the form of service to be used would be determined by the Incumbent and the Parochial Church Council, with the older 1662 forms of services continuing to be available alongside the 1928 forms. Since the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 required measures affecting the Book of Common Prayer to be approved by Parliament before receiving royal assent, the measure authorising its use, together with an annexed copy (a \\"Deposited Book\\"), was submitted to Parliament. The House of Lords approved the Book by a large majority, but the corresponding resolution in the House of Commons was defeated by 33 votes on 15 December 1927. The Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks (later Viscount Brentford) and Rosslyn Mitchell \\"reached and inflamed all the latent Protestant prejudices in the House\\" and argued strongly against it, largely in opposition to the \\"Roman\\" practice of reservation of sacrament which the Book would have legalised in the Church of England, albeit in a limited fashion and for the specific purpose of communion of the sick only. The prayer book was submitted again the following year and defeated a second time in the Commons on 14 June 1928. In response to this rejection, the bishops issued a unanimous statement, asserting the Church of England's right to order its forms of worship and, in 1929, the Upper House of the Convocation of Canterbury resolved that bishops might approve the use of the 1928 book, notwithstanding the lack of parliamentary authority. The 'Shorter Prayer Book', published in 1946 with a preface by the archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher, contained services from the 1662 book with alternative material from the 1928 book in parallel columns. The 1928 revised forms of Matrimony and Baptism were quite widely adopted, but those of other rites tended not to be; the consequence, in practice, being very wide variation in liturgical practice from parish to parish, with very few clergy adhering consistently to the strict observation of either the 1662 or the 1928 forms of worship. In 1966, with some changes, many services from the 1928 book were authorised as legal for public worship, as the First Series of Alternative Services, and subsequently continued in use through authorisation by inclusion in the Alternative Service Book and its successor, Common Worship.

She was still performing (in her 80s) into the 2000s, possibly the last surviving and performing singer of the generation of popular entertainers from the 1930s and wartime years. Her younger sister is Lisa Davis Waltz, a teen actress in the 1950s and 1960s and later, the voice of Anita in Disney's 101 Dalmatians. Music career Born in Plymouth, England, to Harry Lomax Davis and Queenie Davis, she began to sing for the Oscar Rabin Band, co-led by her father and saxophonist Oscar Rabin, at the age of eight, eventually turning professional and singing with, among others, Oscar Rabin, Geraldo, and the Sky Rockets Dance Orchestra. From the age of just 12, accompanied by a chaperone, she also performed and recorded with Django Reinhardt in Paris and on several European tours, and was the featured singer with the Quintette du Hot Club de France during their tour of the U.K. in July-August 1939, including a performance with the Quintette for BBC Television (broadcast in August 1939), of which, unfortunately, no copy appears to survive. She became popular singing for British and Allied troops during World War II, during which time Glenn Miller discovered her in London, and she sang for the Army Air Force Orchestra. After the second world war, she moved to Los Angeles with her father's big band, and with Frank Sinatra for one year on Your Hit Parade. She was part of the Four Girls singing group with Jane Russell, Rhonda Fleming, Della Russell, and Connie Haines. They recorded sixteen singles, and albums which became best sellers. She appeared both in variety shows and films. She was married to William Mann Moore (aka Peter Potter), disc jockey and host of the 1950s Emmy Winning television show, Jukebox Jury. They had three children, William Bell, Merry Bell, and Melinda Beryl. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1996, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her. Still performing into her 80s, she was featured at several concerts/festivals in the mid 2000s with the backing of the guitarist John Jorgenson and his band, who featured her vocals on one track, \\"Don't Worry 'Bout Me\\", on his 2007 CD \\"Ultraspontane\\", reprising her original recording with Django almost 70 years earlier. On 28 October 2011, Davis died in Los Angeles from complications of Alzheimer's disease, at age 87. She was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles.

Data tampering  In February 2017, two Randox employees were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice amid allegations of data tampering within Randox Testing Services, used by many Police Forces in England and Wales for forensic toxicology. Randox acquired this laboratory in Manchester from Trimega laboratories which went into administration in 2014. As of November 2017, around 50 criminal prosecutions for driving offences had been dropped in what BBC home affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw, described as \\"the biggest forensic science scandal in the UK for decades\\". Police forces have begun reviewing over 10,000 criminal cases that may be affected by the alleged data manipulation, including sexual and violent crimes.  Owen Paterson  In March 2019 it was reported that former cabinet minister Owen Paterson, who was a consultant to Randox Laboratories, had helped to lobby the government to seek contracts for them.

These ponies evolved from foundation bloodstock of 60 Timor Ponies that were imported by English settlers from Indonesia to Coffin Bay, on the southern tip of the Eyre Peninsula at Coffin Bay, South Australia. Coffin Bay Ponies are often confused with Australia's most noted feral horses, the Brumby, which lives in wild mobs all over Australia. However, Coffin Bay ponies live in a fenced protected area. Characteristics Coffin Bay ponies have always been reared in a semi-wild and wild manner, which has made them healthy and hardy with strong bones and hooves. Ponies have a conformation which is very reminiscent of a Timor pony with good hindquarters and short legs. They have a kind and intelligent eye. There are two acceptable types of Coffin Bay ponies, the lighter saddle type and a slightly stronger type with clean legs, for both driving and riding. Domesticated ponies have a very manageable and friendly temperament that is suitable for children and small adults. Even feral ponies also possess a friendly, intelligent temperament. Coffin Bay ponies can vary in height but they are not above . They are mainly bay, brown, black, chestnut, grey, red and blue roan and dun, but all solid colours are permissible. Broken colours such as pinto testify to the presence of other bloodlines and are therefore not permitted. White markings on the legs or face are acceptable.  History  In 1839, the settler and British Captain Hawson and his family arrived in Happy Valley in South Australia to live and breed horses. With him came the 60 Timor Ponies which Captain Hawson had purchased from the Rajah of Sumatra in Indonesia. These ponies would be the basis of Hawson‚Äôs newly established stud farm to breed ponies that were well suited for the hot climate. Hawson‚Äôs company expanded and the Timor ponies were moved to his new lease at the Coffin Bay Run in 1847. Here they were bred in a semi- wild, yet controlled manner in the new stud, Coffin Bay Run. In 1857 Coffin Bay Run was sold to W.R. Mortlock who instead of investing in the pure Timor ponies, imported larger horses and ponies, which he crossed with the semi-wild Timor ponies to produce larger stock. Mortlock used approved stallions of the Welsh Cob, Thoroughbred and Arabian Horse breeds in the herd. He also used Clydesdale and Hackney horses who may have had influence on the Coffin Bay Ponies. Mortlock used a selective breeding plan and culled unwanted ponies which were sold. During the early 1860s, the ponies were very popular and often sold in pairs and matching teams to be used for driving, while others were sold and used for polo and as cavalry horses. In 1927 Mortlock's descendants sold the Coffin Bay Run to Martin Cash. Before the sale, the management of the farm and horse herd had been neglected, as it was no longer commercially viable to breed horses. Ponies became untamed and wild, growing rapidly in number and causing major problems for the farm's new owner. Many of the ponies were culled or shot in order to reduce their numbers. The Morgan family purchased the Coffin Bay Run in 1932. This family immediately saw potential for these ponies and sold them instead of shooting them. Ponies became popular again when the depression led to petrol and diesel becoming rationed and very expensive. Tractors, which once had replaced horses for field work on the farms, were now too expensive to use, making ponies and horses indispensable. The Morgan family therefore mustered a small portion of the herd a few times during the year and sold them at markets in Port Augusta. After World War II finished, however, demand for ponies declined as the economy stabilized and the mechanization of society made equine work animals obsolete. Moss Morgan, who owned the farm during this time, developed a new use for Coffin Bay Ponies, which he had mustered, trained to ride, and then sold as riding ponies. In 1972, the farm was taken over by Geoff Morgan. In an attempt to save the herd, he gave the farm to the South Australia Government to transform the land into a national park. Ponies could still live in the park and were there when the Coffin Bay Peninsula was formally declared a National Park in 1982. They were then regarded as feral animals on land being managed for the preservation of native species. The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) then launched a program to eliminate the ponies from the peninsula. Concerned locals banded together to form the non-profit Coffin Bay Pony Society, a volunteer group dedicated to keeping the ponies in the Park. This group would work out a compromise in order to permit the horses to stay if they were managed under more controlled conditions. Ponies had caused damage on land within the national park but it was agreed that the breed had a historical value. In 1991 the first Management Agreement was entered into between the Coffin Bay Pony Society and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. It allowed then a much smaller herd, or \\"mob,\\" consisting of twenty mares, one stallion, and their foals, to live in the park. To avoid the mobs growing in numbers, the ponies were mustered once a year, to be handled and then auctioned. A predetermined price per head went to the NPWS for land management and the rest of the money was used by the Coffin Bay Pony Society. In 1999 the National Parks and Wildlife Service devised a new Draft Management Plan for the area that included the proposal of a Wilderness Zone that would take the ponies away from their natural pastures. After failing to consult with the Office of Environment and Heritage, the Government ordered that the herd should be moved. Following the public outcry that ensued in 2003, the State Government was forced to compromise. Instead of being eliminated, the ponies were relocated to a special parcel of nearby land purchased equally by the Pony Preservation Society and the State Government for A$200,000. On 29 February 2004, the final mob of 35 or 40 ponies were moved to their new home, ironically called the \\"Brumbies Run\\", near Coffin Bay. The ponies are now living there with minimal contact from people, but may be viewed in a vehicle by arrangement with the preservation society. Once a year they are mustered, handled, and auctioned.

The corporation is open to all Mark Master Masons. [DEAD LINK] History It was originally formed as an Operative Lodge in Ayr, and according to the legends and rituals of the order it formed one of the number which constituted the Grand Lodge of Antient and Accepted Freemasons of Scotland in 1736. It has since evolved into a fun or side degree which raises money for local charities. The legends of the order also state that minutes were kept but have since been lost and that the Banner used by the corporation is still preserved by an Ayrshire Freemason and that there are other relics in existence. 20th Century Formation In 1903 the organization was reformed in Edinburgh by Brethren Philip and William Murray. It spread across Scotland and England, but became less popular after World War II. [DEAD LINK] Although not recognised or in amity with the Grand Lodge of Scotland, the candidate must be a regular mason, and many eminent masons are Square Men. [DEAD LINK] There is a degree ceremony and secrets are imparted, but the main purpose is to raise funds for local good causes and charities. Initially the Squaremen only admitted Mark Master Masons who hold or have held office in a Craft Lodge, or who are Royal Arch Companions. Candidates must have been Master Masons for at least five years and be thirty years of age or over. The first Squaremen meetings were held in Edinburgh on the first day of each of the five winter months, November to April, and at the January meeting office bearers were elected. A meeting of Squaremen is called a SHED, as opposed to a Masonic Lodge, and a Grand Shed was formed to oversee the Order. [DEAD LINK] At its prime there were 12 daughter Sheds in existence and these Sheds met fairly regularly and in masonic halls, usually varying their venue each time. The joining fee was originally 60 Scottish merks (¬£3/5/0 or about ¬£15.75), today the fee is in the region of ¬£30 - ¬£50 depending on the Shed. The Order today In the early 21st Century, the order consists of 9 working Sheds in Scotland and 1 in England, each responsible for raising money for local charities selected by the Squaremen of each shed.

When the company went bankrupt, Bergstein and Tutor became owners of dozens of Franchise's films. By 2006, they had also acquired Capitol Films and ThinkFilm, in the process becoming major players in the independent film sector. In March 2010, fourteen creditors attempting to force the five companies controlled by Bergstein and Tutor into Chapter 11 bankruptcy were granted an emergency motion by a court to have an interim trustee appointed to oversee the companies. Capitol Films and ThinkFilm were formally declared bankrupt by a Federal judge in October 2010, and Bergstein's remaining three companies‚ÄîR2D2, CT-1 Holdings and Capco‚Äîin 2011. One of the creditors that had forced Bergstein's companies into bankruptcy, Aramid Entertainment Fund, had its claims against Bergstein's companies dismissed in 2012 ‚Äî a judgment that was upheld by the New York Supreme Court in 2013. In 2012 the former in-house counsel for Capitol Films who had left the company to work for Aramid, was successfully sued by Bergstein for breach of fiduciary trust and malpractice and ordered to pay $50 million in damages to Bergstein. In 2014, another creditor, Screen Capital International, had its claims rejected by a federal judge. Lawyers successfully argued that it was not a legitimate creditor because it had purchased the claims from another entity. The U.S. District and Bankruptcy Courts dismissed the outstanding involuntary bankruptcy cases in 2016. Bergstein also took an advisory role in the sale of Miramax in 2010 to an investor group that included his partner, Ron Tutor. The purchase, for $660 million, included the rights to more than 700 library titles. In 2012, Bergstein sued the owners of Miramax alleging they had reneged on paying him a $6.1 million fee and a 3.33 percent stake as compensation for his role in the acquisition; the litigation ended two weeks later when Bergstein and Miramax reached a settlement. On November 9, 2016, Bergstein was arrested at his Hidden Hills, California home after being indicted for fraud, and was convicted by a Federal jury on March 1, 2018 of defrauding investors out of $26 million. In June 2018 Bergstein was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay a $250,000 fine. Bergstein cried as he requested leniency but United States federal judge P. Kevin Castel said his crimes needed to be \\"punished severely\\" to \\"send a message\\".  Personal life  In 2011, Bergstein, along with his wife Sara, formally dedicated the Conejo Jewish Academy's adult education program to Bergstein's father, naming the program \\"Leonard Bergstein Jewish Academy.\\"Conejo Jewish Academy: A project of Chabad of the Conejo‚ÄîDedicated in Memory of Leonard Bergstein Bergstein currently serves on the board of the Sheriff's Youth Foundation, a youth program run by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and the board at the Grossman Burn Foundation, a nonprofit organization supporting burn survivors and their families.

Ortlieb described it as including \\"every conflict imaginable: life and death, struggle, good and evil, intense suffering and powerful spiritual message.\\" In March of that year associate pastor Dr. Alfred W.

Divided from the rest of the Maasai Mara National Reserve by the Mara River, the Mara Triangle is less visited and less crowded, with a high concentration of game all year-round including the Big Five (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino) and diverse plains game such as cheetah, hyena, jackal, wildebeest, zebra, giraffe, waterbuck and many other species. The Mara Triangle is the area where the herds of the Great Migration enter and exit the Maasai Mara National Reserve from the Serengenti National Park in Tanzania, making it a prime viewing spot for this wildlife spectacle. Crossings of the Mara River are world-renown for being particularly dramatic, featuring in many wildlife documentaries such as Wild Africa and Big Cat Diary. Geography The Mara Triangle is one third of the Maasai Mara National Reserve, with an area of 510 km¬≤. It has two natural borders and one political; to the southwest is the Tanzania/Serengeti border, to the east is the Mara River, and to the northwest is the Oldoinyio Escarpment (also called Oloololo or Siria Escarpment). The landscapes of the Mara Triangle include riverine forest, red oat grasslands, volcanic hills and the 400-metre high Oloololo Escarpment. Tourism The Mara Triangle is managed by the Mara Conservancy, under contract by the Trans- Mara county council, a local non profit organisation formed by the local Maasai, and contains a number of anti-poaching units. There are two permanent lodges inside the Mara Triangle - Mara Serena and Little Governors. There are a few camps on the park's periphery which offer game drives inside the park: Angama Mara, Bateleur Camp, Kichwa Tembo, Kilima Camp, Mara Engai Wilderness Lodge, Mara Siria, and Mpata Safari Club. it is also possible to take your own camping gear and stay at one of the public or private campsites and a number of seasonal mobile camps are set up to coincide with the arrival of the megaherds of the Great Migration each year. The Mara Triangle is easy to access by plane with Angama Mara Airfield, Kichwa Tembo, Mara North, Musiara and Serena airstrips, and with daily scheduled flights connecting it with other parks and reserves in Kenya, the Kenyan coast (Mombasa, Diani, Malindi) and Nairobi (Jomo Kenyatta and Wilson airports). The Mara Triangle is also reachable by road, although this is not recommended for those unfamiliar with the route due to poor road conditions.

He also worked with German krautrockers Can, and BAP. Biography He attended two Catholic boarding schools for nine years and Exeter College of Art and Design for three years, before deciding to take up music full-time and playing his first professional jobs for the US army in Germany. After a return to London, he learned his craft on the road all over Europe and the UK with various band line-ups, playing his own songs from day one and eventually landing his first record deal. One pub-rock influenced LP was followed by two albums for Polydor, both recorded at the legendary Can Studio near Cologne with Jaki Liebezeit and guests Richard Thompson and Toots Thielemans. 'As Real As Disneyland' garnered album-of-month status and sold well in the German-speaking territories, setting a pattern of Dawson having more success abroad than at home that has remained a feature of his career so far. In the early nineties Julian turned his attentions to the USA, making two albums in Nashville with E Street Band bass-player Garry Tallent producing and a host of local guests, including Vince Gill, Duane Eddy, Bill Payne and Steve Forbert. 'Fragile As China' charted in Germany and helped him build a radio presence and a solid following in the USA, where he still tours at least once a year. Visits to the States, and Nashville and Austin in particular, became a regular part of his life, leading to further recordings (five in all for BMG) and co-writes and collaborations with artists such as Dan Penn, Willie Nile, Nicky Hopkins, Jules Shear and Lucinda Williams, with whom he also recorded a memorable duet version of 'How Can I Sleep Without You'. For several years he kept together a live band, featuring guitarist Steuart Smith (now with the Eagles). More albums followed both as a member of Plainsong with Iain Matthews and solo including 'Move Over Darling', with Richard Thompson, Dan Penn and the Roches, 'Under The Sun' with Soft Boys Kimberley Rew and Andy Metcalfe and 2002's 'Hillbilly Zen' with ex-Byrd Gene Parsons. Dawson has performed at festivals such as Newport (USA), Cambridge, Cropredy and Glastonbury in England, on tour with Plainsong, Al Stewart, Fairport Convention and others, on TV's 'Later With Jools Holland' (with the Richard Thompson Band) or the Europe-wide 'Rockpalast' with his own. In 1996 he produced Charlie Louvin's comeback album The Longest TrainCharlie Louvin: The Longest Train: Charlie Louvin: The Longest Train, accessdate: 19 May 2016 and later appeared with him at the BBC Proms. Dawson's 2008 CD Deep Rain, produced in Nashville by Dan Penn, helped to introduce him to a wider audience and was followed by a band tour, preserved on the double CD/DVD Live, released in 2010. He has been producing a first solo album for Beverley Martyn. 2010 also saw the first publication of his biography of Nicky Hopkins by Random House, Germany. The English language book followed in spring 2011, via Desert Hearts in the UK (in hardback) and Backstage Books/Plus One Press in North America (in paperback). First reviews were positive (4 stars from Uncut magazine).

The population fled in 1570 from the Ottoman conquests, but was repopulated in the 17th century.

He became a nuncio and archbishop in 1995 and served in several African countries, Chile, and Canada before being posted to Paris. Beginning in January 2019 he was under investigation by French authorities for sexual crimes. In July 2019, the Vatican lifted his diplomatic immunity to allow him to face criminal charges. He was allowed to relocate to Rome; Pope Francis accepted his resignation in December 2019. His criminal trial will be held in Paris starting on November 10, 2020 and will be held in- person.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/23/popes-former-french- ambassador-stand-trial-sexual-assault-paris/ Career Ventura was born on 9 December 1944 in Borgosatollo, Italy. He was ordained a priest on 14 June 1969 for the Diocese of Brescia. To prepare for a diplomatic career he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1967. He joined the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1978. He earned a doctor of letters and holds a licentiate in canon law. His assignments from 1978 to 1984 were in Brazil, Bolivia and the United Kingdom. He then worked in Rome with the Section for Relations with States at the Secretariat of State until 1995. On 25 March 1995, Pope John Paul II appointed him titular archbishop of Equilium and apostolic nuncio to the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Niger. He was consecrated a bishop on 29 April 1995 by Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Secretary of State. He was made nuncio to Chile on 25 March 1999. On 22 June 2001, John Paul named him apostolic nuncio to Canada. Pope Benedict XVI appointed him apostolic nuncio to France on 22 September 2009, replacing Fortunato Baldelli who had been appointed as Major Penitentiary of the Apostolic Penitentiary.  Criminal allegations  In January 2019 the French authorities opened an investigation into Ventura after a junior official at Paris City Hall accused him of molestation. Ventura has not made comment on the allegations. On 15 February 2019, Le Monde reported that a young male employed by the office of the mayor of Paris had filed a complaint for sexual assault against Ventura and that authorities had launched a formal inquiry in January. The city employee, Mathieu de La Souch√®re, and two other accusers using aliases, have asked French officials to ask the Vatican to waive Ventura's diplomatic immunity. French European Minister Nathalie Loiseau said she expects the Vatican to allow Ventura to be tried. On 22 February a Canadian man, Christian Vachon, charged Ventura had touched him improperly in July 2008 when he was 32. Vachon said Ventura's successor as Nuncio to Canada, Archbishop Luigi Bonazzi, called him the day he registered his complaint to discuss it. Ventura allowed himself to be questioned by French police in April. At his own request, Ventura met with his four accusers on 22‚Äì23 May and denied their charges. The accusers' attorneys were not allowed to ask him questions. On 8 July a Vatican spokesperson said the Holy See had informed French authorities a week earlier that it was waiving Ventura's diplomatic immunity. He called it \\"an extraordinary gesture\\". Le Monde reported it was the first withdrawal of diplomatic immunity on the part of the Vatican in modern history. As of 30 September 2019, Ventura was living at a residence for retired priests in Rome, still subject to French investigators and prosecution. At the time his France trial was announced in July 2020, Ventura was still under investigation for the alleged 2008 incident in Ottawa, Canada was well.https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pope-francis-ex- envoy-luigi-ventura-to-stand-trial-for-sexual-assault-charges-2267783 Resignation Pope Francis accepted his resignation on 17 December 2019, which Ventura had submitted as required on his 75th birthday. Such resignations are either accepted by Pope Francis quickly, as in Ventura's case, or sometimes he kept bishops in their jobs longer. The fact that Ventura resignation was announced on the same day as Francis‚Äô abuse reforms does not seem to be a coincidence. The resignation and its acceptance had been anticipated since Ventura had been relieved of his responsibilities and moved to Rome in September. Lib√©ration, which published some of the earliest complaints against Ventura, called the idea of retiring without referencing the criminal charges against Ventura \\"a beautiful example of Jesuitry\\". Criminal charges and trial On July 23, 2020, the Paris Prosecutor's Office announced that Ventura had been criminally charged with sexually assaulting four men in 2018 and 2019 and will stand trial in Paris starting November 10, 2020.https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-vatican-envoy-to-france-to-face- trial-on-sexual-assault-charges-11595517674 Ventura's lawyer stated that the former nuncio agreed to return to Paris and make in-person court appearances during his trial.https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/13194/paris-court-to-try- nuncio-on-sexual-abuse-charges  See also  *Fortunato Baldelli *Apostolic Nuncio *Apostolic Nunciature to France References Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Apostolic Nuncios to France Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Canada Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Chile Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Ivory Coast Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Burkina Faso Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Niger Category:Italian titular archbishops Category:Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy alumni Category:20th-century Roman Catholics Category:21st-century Roman Catholics ","title":"Luigi Ventura"},{"id":"24432921","text":"The 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment (Airborne) is a light Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron currently serving as the 173rd Airborne Brigade's Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Targeting Acquisition (RSTA) Squadron based out of Tower Barracks in Grafenw√∂hr, Germany. It is the only Airborne RSTA Squadron within the European, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) area of responsibility. The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron was originally organized as a mechanized cavalry reconnaissance squadron in the 1st Cavalry Division. It was the oldest and most experienced squadron (battalion) sized mechanized reconnaissance unit in the US Army. It completed six campaigns in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy during World War II, while attached to various infantry and armored divisions. The 91st Cavalry Recon Squadron was a non- divisional unit and reported directly to the Army's II Corps. The unit was deactivated on 23 June 1953. The 91st Reconnaissance Squadron was re- activated, re-organized, and re-designated the 1st Squadron (Airborne), 91st Cavalry Regiment on 8 June 2006, at Conn Barracks in Schweinfurt, Germany. This reactivation was part of the transition of the 173rd Airborne Brigade to the U.S. Army's new modular force structure. This reactivation was the first time the colors of the 1st Squadron (Airborne), 91st Cavalry Regiment had flown since the end of World War II. Organized as ‚Ä≥Task Force Saber‚Ä≥, 1-91 CAV has subsequently deployed three times to the International Security Assistance Force's (ISAF) Regional Command East in Eastern Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). During OEF VIII 2007-08, the Squadron deployed troops to Nuristan, Kunar, Nangarhar, and Paktika Provinces. During OEF X from 2009‚Äì10, and OEF XII-XIII from 2012‚Äì13, the Squadron deployed to Logar Province. Soon after returning to Germany from OEF XIII in March 2013, 1-91 CAV moved from Conn Barracks in Schweinfurt to Tower Barracks in Grafenw√∂hr due to a Brigade realignment and the imminent closure of USAG Schweinfurt. After moving to Tower Barracks, 1-91 CAV shifted focus from the OEF mission to Airborne proficiency, and NATO support and tactical reassurance. Since 2013, 1-91 CAV has conducted operations in Poland, the Czech Republic, Italy, France, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, and Israel in addition to its German home. Most notably, 1-91 CAV represented the United States in several internationally recognized NATO exercises to include: Operation Steadfast Jazz, Operation Atlantic Resolve and Operation Saber Junction.

When he was advised by friendly foreign forces that an enemy element was approaching his position, Major Bostic rapidly employed mortar fire and close air support on the approaching enemy to suppress them. While directing fire, his position came under enemy small arms fire, nevertheless, he continued to direct fire until the enemy was defeated. When the immediate threat was neutralized, Major Bostic maneuvered his quick reaction force to a forward position to retrieve three casualties. After a lull in the battle, the enemy reinforced their attack and engaged Major Bostick and the forward elements from three sides. Once again, he employed direct and indirect fire on the enemy positions and enabled the lead element to begin to move to more defensible positions. As the fire on his position intensified, Major Bostick positioned himself between the enemy and his own exposed Soldiers who were navigating the mountainous terrain and engaged the enemy with accurate fire. While in this exposed position and under continuous small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire, he was mortally wounded. Major Bostick's selfless actions ensured his Soldiers had sufficient time to retreat through the hazardous terrain in order to seek cover and survive the attack. Major Bostick's actions are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, the 91st Cavalry Regiment, and the United States Army.

Life  Craik grew up in Kennoway, where his father was the schoolmaster of a church-run school.Tayler, p. 1 He had two notable older brothers: George Lillie Craik and James Craik (who served as Moderator of the General Assembly 1863/64).http://www.glasgowwestaddress.co.uk/100_Glasgow_Men/Craik_James.htm From 1820 he joined his brothers at the University of St AndrewsTayler, p. 6 and did well at literature, language, philosophy, and religious studies. By his own admission, he was ‚Äúa religious man without God‚ÄùTayler, p. 9 but drifted back to Christianity in 1826 at the age of 21. In July 1826 he was invited to become the family tutor for Anthony Norris Groves in Exeter Tayler, p.60 where he spent the next two years. He left their employ to return to Edinburgh on 3 May 1828,Tayler, p.98 but a few weeks later he returned to Exeter, to become the tutor to the two sons of John Synge, formerly of Glanmore Castle in Ireland but then living at Buckridge House, near Teignmouth.Tayler, p.99 During his three-year tenure with Synge, Craik made a detailed examination of the original languages of the Bible, publishing a book ‚ÄúEasy introduction to the Hebrew Language‚Äù (London: Sealey and Burnside) in 1831, which was funded by Synge.Tayler, p.122 In 1829 he made the acquaintance of George M√ºller,Tayler, p.128 a Prussian who had come to Teignmouth to convalesce from an illness. The two became lifelong friends.Tayler, p.xiv M√ºller moved down from London in January 1830 to become pastor of the Baptist church in Teignmouth, while Craik took a similar post in Shaldon in April 1831.Tayler, p.125 On 30 March 1832, Craik accepted an invitation from Mr A Chapman to take over the pastorate of Gideon Chapel in Newfoundland Street, Bristol.Tayler, p.144 Shortly afterwards he wrote to George M√ºller asking him to join him in this work, and M√ºller moved to Bristol in the second half of April 1832.Tayler, p.145 As well as the Gideon Chapel, they also led the Bethesda Chapel (neither building remains, having been destroyed during the Second World War), and led many to faith in Jesus Christ. In 1834 the two men founded the Scriptural Knowledge Institution, which still operates today, as part of The George M√ºller Charitable Trust. Henry Craik was known as a very humble and well-liked man. His ability to capture the attention of a congregation was legendary as he expounded the teachings of the Bible with clarity and exuberance.  Family  In 1831 Craik married Mary Anderson.Tayler, p.129 She died on 1 February 1832 from consumption,Tayler, p.142 and he remarried on 30 October 1832, to Sarah Howland.Tayler, p.160 It is not clear how many children they had. After his first son, Henry William (born on 18 January 1834),Tayler, p.170 an unnamed daughter is recorded in his diary as being born in 1836 and dying on 18 February 1837.Tayler, p.189 Another son, George, was born on 29 August 1840 but he died on 28 June 1841.Tayler, p.210 Mary Eliza was born on 30 April 1842 but died on 11 November 1843.Tayler, p.215 On 2 March 1846, his diary talks of walking with his ‚Äúwife and children‚Äù. Another girl was born on 4 August 1847 but his diary intimates that she died in December 1848. However, no mention of this is made in W Elfe Tayler‚Äôs book. Tayler also writes that, whilst dying from stomach cancer, Craik was cared for by his wife and daughter. Another son, also named George, was born on 20 December 1849 and another unnamed lad on 17 September 1853. Craik's eldest brother was the writer and literary critic George Lillie Craik.

The lido was for a number of years closed but reopened undergoing refurbishment under the control of Hilsea Lido Pool for the People. Description The Hilsea Lido is a leisure facility featuring a Main Pool (measuring 67m x 18m ‚Äì 4.6m deep) and a large Splash Pool (45m x 18m x 6ins deep) designed for younger swimmers. At 4.6 metres (15 feet) deep, the lido has the distinction of being the deepest outdoor pool in the UK apart from Broomhill Pool which is the same depth. Though closed throughout 2009 and 2010 due to refurbishment work, the Main Pool is normally a venue for a number of sporting activities such as Water polo, diving championships, as well as swimming. The Splash (paddling) Pool is surrounded by green space and located next to the children's playground, but Portsmouth City Council are proposing replacing it with a water play area (similar to the one near Blue Reef Aquarium in Southsea). The lido is managed by a voluntary group of local residents, the HLPP Trust, under licence from Portsmouth City Council. The site of the lido is connected to Alexandra Park via the Stamshaw Esplanade. Hilsea Lido seen from the air in 1947 History Plans for development of the lido were agreed in 1932 and the lido opened on 24 July 1935. The architect for the lido was Joseph Parkin. The pool originally used seawater, converting later to freshwater, and the lido design included two large fountains which have been retained but are no longer used. The Main Pool and changing facilities were designed for the use of 768 adults and 180 children with accommodation for around 1000 spectators. In 1936 the Lido was visited by the British diving team from 1936 Summer Olympics who gave a demonstration on 31 August During World War 2 the main pool was closed to the general public and was given over to the use of the various military units in the area. Between 1946 and 1951 a miniature railway ran along the lido site. In 1974 the Lido was used as a set for the Bernie's Holiday Camp scene in the film Tommy. Later in the 70s the lido's diving platforms were removed. In 1995 the Lido lent its name to the Vulcan Software management simulation game Hillsea Lido. In 2006 plans for refurbishing the lido were abandoned by the Council, however extended campaigning by residents continued and in 2009 a management trust had been established, now a registered charity. In 2010 Hilsea Lido Pool for the People acquired the lido and adjoining Blue Lagoon building on a 99-year lease Portsmouth City Council. The lido was open for viewing on 19 September 2009 for the Heritage Open Days.HOD website (retrieved 22 September 2009) In June 2012 Sport England gave Hilsea lido Pool for the people a ¬£50,000 grant towards the cost of restoring the pool. The money was used to refurbish the pool's pumps and fit new lockers and showers. In the winter of 2010/11 the splash pool was damaged by freezing conditions. In April 2011 Portsmouth City Council decided to replace the pool with a new design featuring two pools. The new design was named the Hilsea Jubilee Splash Pool and was completed in 2012 at a cost of ¬£332,000. The lido reopened in July 2014. In 2015 a new 2 meter diving platform was added to the lido.

It is located on the shores of the Chukchi Sea on a sandy spit that divides Neskynpil'gyn Lagoon from the sea, close to Idlidlya Island. Population: Municipally, Neshkan is subordinated to Chukotsky Municipal District and incorporated as Neshkan Rural Settlement. History Like many other villages in Chukotka, Neshkan was founded as a result of Soviet economics. In the 1950s, attempts to unify the itinerant reindeer herders of the area, consisting of the Nuteikvyn, Anayan, Tolgunen, and Vylkarney amongst others into a collective farm led to the creation of the village.Strogoff, p. 120f The village took its name from the Chukchi word Naskuk, meaning \\"Seal's Head\\", so called because one of the mountains surrounding the village looks like a seal's head when viewed from the sea. Neshkan has seen some benefit in recent years from the money that has been generated by the exploitation of the oil and gas present in the area, as a number of multi-story houses were built in the village in 2005.Official website of Chukotsky District The Vega Expedition, the first Arctic expedition to navigate through the Northeast Passage, had to winter from September 1878 to July 1879 in a point (67¬∫ 4' 49\\" North, 173¬∫ 23' 2\\" West) near Neshkan. Economy Unlike such villages as Tavayvaam, which have suffered serious economic hardships since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when all the reindeer owned by the villagers were lost, leading to continuing high unemployment in the area, Neshkan's economy is still dominated by reindeer herding, with there being six separate herds maintained by the villagers, though this is also supplemented by fishing. However, the village still endures considerable economic isolation as a result of its geography. Only pensioners are paid in cash, while almost all other transactions are barter or coupons (which are often paid to state employees in the region in lieu of cash). What cash is available is spent on necessary supplies, which, due to the isolation of the village and the resulting difficulties in transporting food and other supplies, is often nearly double the price found elsewhere in the region.East West Institute. Russian Regional Report, Vol. 4, No. 1, 14 January 1999 Demographics The village is small, with a population of 704 according to the most recent census results, split equally between men and women, and a reduction on an estimated 2009 population of 720 people, itself a slight increase on the estimated 2003 population of 704 inhabitants (662 of them indigenous people).Red Cross of Chukotka. Chukotsky District (Archived) Transport Neshkan is 250 km from the district centre Lavrentiya. Air There are weekly flights from Lavrentiya to the village and the only other means of getting there is a four- to five-day off-road journey. Road Like almost all Chukotkan settlements, there is no direct link from the village to any other settlement by permanent road. There is however, a small network of roads within the settlement including:Neshkan - Chukotsky District - Pochtovik Mail Delivery Service * –£–ª–∏—Ü–∞ 50 –ª–µ—Ç –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ –û–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è (Ulitsa 50 Let Velikogo Oktyabrya, lit. 50 Years of October Street) * –£–ª–∏—Ü–∞ –ë–µ—Ä–∑–∏–Ω—è (Ulitsa Berzinya, lit.

Earthquakes Neshkan experienced a number of earthquakes throughout the 20th century, including several quakes during 1928 measuring 7.7 on the Richter ScaleMackey et al., p. 9 and a number measuring between 5 and 6 throughout the second half of the century. At the time that these regular earthquakes began to affect the village, there was a lack of seismic stations in the okrug. In 2002, Bilibino was the site of the only working seismic station in the region and was over 700 km away. Prior to this, there had been a seismic station in Iultin, but this was still over 200 km away and neither was close enough to any epicentre to draw out any trends.Mackey et al., p. 1 In response to these earthquakes and the growing complaints from the inhabitants of Neshkan a permanent station was established in the village, which detected over 150 small quakes in little more than eighteen days,Mackey et al., p. 5 leading geophysicists to suggest that the quakes have been caused by a previously unknown fault extending across this part of Chukotka, a view strengthened by the linear pattern of the quakes and the presence of hot springs in places like Lorino.The Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System. A Seismic Swarm Near Neshkan, Chukotka, Far Northeastern Russia The local toponymy suggests a more longstanding association between the indigenous people, with many geographical objects having names which conjure images of earthquakes such as the mountains Elyulivoigyn, Ivuichin, and Eletkun, meaning \\"shivering\\", \\"moving\\", and \\"dancing\\" mountain respectively, as well as nearby lake names such as Einekuem, meaning \\"buzzing lake\\".Mackey et al., p. 7f These earthquakes have been attributed to the newly theorised Loloveem Fault, which runs from Cape Neshkan, where the village is situated, in a south- southwesterly direction through Neskynpilgyn Lagoon and Innuloon Lagoon.Mackey et al., Fig. 4 Photo gallery File:Neschkan 1 2013-08-01.jpg|Neshkan (Chukotka, Russia; 67¬∞2‚Äò15‚Äô‚ÄôN, 172¬∞57‚Äô50‚Äô‚ÄôW) File:Neschkan 2 2013-08-01.jpg|Neshkan, street scene File:Neschkan 3 2013-08-01.jpg|Neshkan, schoolhouse File:Neschkan 4 2013-08-01.jpg|Neshkan, heating plant See also *List of inhabited localities in Chukotsky District References Notes Sources  K.

Biography Gyulay was born on 1 September 1799 in Pest, Hungary to parents Ign√°c Gyulay von Maros-N√©meth und N√°daska and Maria Freiin von Edelsheim. At the age of seventeen in 1816 he served as a leutnant in the 60th \\"Ign√°c Gyulay\\" infantry battalion. In 1820 he was transferred to the Hesse-Homburg hussar brigade as an oberleutnant and just a year after he was promoted to hauptmann of the Imperial uhlans. In 1826 he was appointed the head of the W√ºrttemberg hussar brigade and soon after in 1829 he became the oberstleutnant of the Hesse- Homburg infantry. In 1831 he was promoted to the rank of oberst and in 1838 to generalmajor. In 1846 he was already the generalleutnant of the 33rd infantry battalion. In 1847 he was the abteilungsf√ºhrer and military captain of the vicinity of Triest. Gyulay's first war-time assignment came in 1848 when the Revolutions of 1848 broke out. First he had to face the Italian states' menace at Pola. He had to defend the imperial fleet stationed in Pola of being seized by its insurgent crew. He immediately relieved the Italian-born sailors of their duties and warned the ships already in sail to do the same. He put the cities of Triest and Pola on defense, armed the ships and filled up their missing Italian crew with people from the local commercial ships. He organized an ad hoc boat squadron as well. Gyulay regrouped the troops retreating from Venice at Isonzo. His efforts prevented a joint Napolitan-Sardinian fleet from ambushing the key ports in the Istria. The Battle of Custoza eased the pressure on the Adriatic coast and Gyulay's precautionary measures secured the area. In 1849 Gyulay had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant general (Feldmarschallleutnant) and that summer was named Austrian Minister of Defense by Emperor Franz Joseph and thus he was involved in Hungarian Revolution of 1848 on the Habsburg side. He was at the siege of Raab on 28 June followed by the Battle of Kom√°rom, which he left in the early stages due at least in part to the tendency of the emperor and his adjutant general Gr√ºnne to bypass his ministry when making military decisions.Rothenburg, G. The Army of Francis Joseph. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 40. He was moved to Milan to take charge of the 5th army division. In 1857, following the resignation of Joseph Radetzky, Gyulay was named Governor of Lombardy-Venetia, residing at Milan. In early 1859, the Kingdom of Sardinia/Piedmont, having allied with France, began mobilizing its army, possibly in preparation for an invasion of Italian territories controlled by Austria. On 23 April, Austria issued an ultimatum to the Sardinians, demanding they demobilize. When the Sardinians refused, the Second Italian War of Independence began. As commander of Austrian forces in Northern Italy, Count Gyulay, now with the rank of feldzeugmeister, was ordered to cross the Ticino River on 29 April, the border between Austrian and Sardinian territory. In response, French forces under Patrice MacMahon were dispatched to defend their Sardinian allies. On 20 May, an Austrian force under Count Stadion was defeated at the Battle of Montebello, after which Gyulay retreated back into Austrian territory. He then suffered another defeat at the Battle of Palestro. The French army then crossed the Ticino into Austrian territory and captured the village of Boffalora sopra Ticino after a small battle. Finally, on 5 June, the main Austrian and French armies met at the Battle of Magenta. The Austrians under Gyulay were defeated, leading to his recall to Vienna. Emperor Franz Josef took personal command of the Austrian army in Lombardy-Venetia, and would go on to lose the subsequent Battle of Solferino. In one of his last military engagements he was reduced to a Regimentskommandeur and was sent to defend Mantua from the Piedmontese invasion. Unsuccessful in doing so he surrendered the city in 1866 eventually leading to its annexation to the newly formed Italy. Gyulay died in Vienna, Austria.  References  *Deak, Istvan.

The foundation of the parish The foundations stone was blessed and laid on 23 March 1889, a ceremony attended by about 1,000 people. Cardinal Moran officially opened the new church on Sunday 22 June 1890, although only the nave had been completed. The new church, described as Italian or Tuscan Gothic, had an impressive facade facing Oxford Street. Coloured marble was incorporated into the basic sandstone and red tuck-pointed brick structure, and Venetian glass mosaics filled the spandrels around the rose window. The mosaics depicted symbols of the four Evangelists and the coat of arms of the Franciscan Order, according to an article in The Builders and Contractors News of 28 June 1890. Unfortunately, all of the mosaics have long disappeared, victims of time and pollution. The Freeman's Journal said that \\"When completed with transepts and sanctuary the church will be one of the largest in Sydney\\". But the 1890 church was never to be completed. In its incomplete state it soon became over-crowded, despite the celebration of five Masses each Sunday. (Canon law at the time prohibited the celebration of Mass after midday.) Archbishop Kelly, therefore decided in 1915 that the church should be completed, despite wartime conditions. It was obvious, though, that even if the church were to be completed according to Barlow's plans it would still be too small for Paddington's Catholic population. A new church was therefore commissioned, designed by Bart Moriarty, but it was to be constructed in two phases. Phase 1 included the sanctuary, sacristies and transepts. Phase 2 would have required the demolition of the 1890 church to make way for the far grander nave of Moriarty's design. The foundation stone was laid on the last Sunday of July 1917. The new Church Building The cost of completing the building immediately was prohibitive and it was decided to make use of the existing portion of the 1890 church as the temporary nave of the new church. The new building (the sanctuary, transepts and sacristies) was blessed and opened on Sunday, June 16, 1918. Phase 2 would commence once the parish had paid off the 10 000 pounds that Phase 1 had cost. However, Phase 2 never eventuated, so the present church consists of the nave of the 1890 church designed by John Barlow, and the transepts, sanctuary and sacristies of the 1918 church designed by Bart Moriarty. It is now clear that Moriarty drew more than a little inspiration for his design from the Sacred Heart Basilica in Timaru, New Zealand. The parish priest of Timaru, Fr Tubman, had commissioned the noted Dunedin architect, Francis Petre, to draw up plans for a church based on photographs of the Saint Thomas Aquinas Cathedral, Reno, Nevada. Fr Tubman had a brother on the staff of the Reno Cathedral and was inspired by that building during a visit in 1907. When work commenced on the construction of the Sacred Heart Basilica, the name of the building surveyor was Bart Moriarty. The Renovation of the church Post Vatican II Following the Second Vatican Council a number of changes were made to facilitate the celebration of the newly revised liturgy. In the mid-1970s a square timber platform was built in the crossing, in front of the old sanctuary, allowing seating in the two side chapels to be turned to face the altar platform. This created a closer contact between the celebrant and congregation during liturgical celebrations, but it also split the congregation into three blocks. Aesthetically, the square was at odds with the round arches, the dome and semi-circular apse. The sanctuary area as you see it today is the result of renovations initiated by Fr Nick Lucas in consultation with architect John O'Brien. The renovations were completed early in 1990. The semi-circular terrazzo extension to the original sanctuary (replacing the timber platform) reflected the shape of the arches overhead. A new altar and lectern were built out of marble from the original pulpit and harmonised with the old high altar. The church was repainted and a new lighting system installed. The new baptismal font of brass and iron has as its pedestal the old font turned upside down. A new stained glass window depicting the baptism of Christ in the Jordan faces the newly positioned font. The original pews, some made by Christian Brothers in the wood-work room of the old Intermediate Technical School, have been stripped to original timber and re-coated, and many have been altered to create the in-the-round effect. The presidential chair is new, but its design was taken from a 19th-century church furniture catalogue. Alterations to the sanctuary and pews, the preparation and erection of the marble work, and the installation of new lighting cost approximately $60 000. Painting of the entire building and the carrying out of other much needed structural repairs cost much more, but the cost was spread over several years.

A., Sa—Ébolt, SGS, Alex Steuard, Russurvey, IMCS, CRS, Inspectorat, Rostest, Transconsulting, Eximtest, Rospromtest  History  On the 19th (6th in the Julian calendar) of October 1917, the Provisional Government passed the statute ‚ÄúOn Chambers of Commerce and Industry.‚Äù The new legislation initiated the creation of territorial chambers, compulsory membership of all managing subjects, rigid boundaries for activities within one province, liabilities on performance of state functions, and the payment of a membership fee equal to four percent of annual tax payments. On the 3rd of April 1923, the North-West Regional Chamber created the first Russian bureau of goods expertise, responsible for the determination of the quality of goods, evaluation of their cost, and the definition of normal losses, sizes of damage caused, and other services. After the 1943 introduction of a new set of regulations, all power over independent expertise became the purview of the National Chamber of Commerce. In the post-war period, the number of surveys carried out grew significantly, and international trade connections strengthened. From 1958 the number of surveys initiated by foreign organisations grew. In 1964, a test centre, GEAZ SOEX, belonging to the expert organisation Soyuzexpertisa CCI RF, was created. The centre was accredited by the Federal Service for accreditation and added to the United register of test laboratories and centres of the Customs union. In June 1999, the External Economic Union, Soyuzexpertisa CCI RF, was reformed into the autonomous non- profit organisation Soyuzexpertisa CCI RF, a wholly owned subsidiary of CCI RF.  Company structure and services  Today, ANO Soyuzexpertisa CCI RF is the largest independent national expertise organisation in Russia, with a holding structure more than thirty representatives in the largest cities and ports of Russia. It employs more than 300 experts with industry experience of more than ten years and owns a number of accredited laboratories.

Louise- Fran√ßoise was known as Mademoiselle du Maine and had no children. Biography Louise Fran√ßoise de Bourbon was born at the Palace of Versailles to Louis Auguste de Bourbon, L√©gitim√© de France, duc du Maine and his wife Louise B√©n√©dicte de Bourbon, known as Mademoiselle de Charolais prior to her marriage. Her father was the eldest legitimised son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. Her mother was later a famous salon hostess at the family home Ch√¢teau de Sceaux. Her mother was also a grand daughter of le Grand Cond√©. Known as Mademoiselle du Maine, she was the youngest of seven children two others of which had been female but had died in infancy. Mademoiselle du Maine was placed in the Abbaye de Maubuisson, a very prestigious abbey in the Saint- Ouen-l'Aum√¥ne area of France, the north-western suburbs of Paris, France.it is here that Gabrielle d'Estr√©es was buried It is located from the center of Paris. As such she grew up here; when once visiting Madame de Maintenon in 1717, Maintenon said that she and her two brothers would have been very pleased with them. Louise-Fran√ßoise was very close to her parents even though the latter were never really close. Louise-Fran√ßoise's mother would frequently embarrass her husband and this caused much friction. On 9 April 1714, she was baptised with the name of her aunt Louise Fran√ßoise de Bourbon, known as Madame la Duchesse. Madame la Duchesse had grown up with the Duke of Maine under the care of Madame de Maintenon. Present at her baptism were the Dauphin, Louis de France who was the guest of honour being helped by Mademoiselle du Maine's other paternal aunt, the Duchess of Orl√©ans. It was the Cardinal de Rohan who baptised Mademoiselle du Maine. In 1718 during the regency of Philippe d'Orl√©ans both of her parents were imprisoned, her father was sent to Doullens and her mother to Dijon. She was moved from the Abbey at Maubuisson to another convent at Chaillot in Paris around the area of the present Trocad√©ro. She stayed at Chaillot till 1720 when her parents were released from their separate imprisonments. At the death of her father, she was given his apartments on the ground floor overlooking the Orangerie and lived next to her mother. Mademoiselle du Maine was rumoured to have been betrothed to one Monsieur de Guise but the said engagement never materialised. By 1740, another possible marriage was with the widowed Prince of Monaco who was often in residence at Versailles. This never occurred either. Another candidate was her first cousin, Louis de Bourbon, youngest son of her namesake and her uncle the Duke of Bourbon. Louise Fran√ßoise is said not to have been attractive; the 1910 book on her mother the duchesse du MaineG√©n√©ral de Pi√©pape, La duchesse du Maine (1910). stated that she was neither pretty nor attractive, and save for her dowry, no one would have sought her hand. He also said that her court hoops were so large that on one occasion they became entangled with those of the Queen and the two women had to stand and pull against each other to disentangle themselves. Louis XV was most annoyed and Monsieur de La Tremoille was sent to the duchesse du Maine with the measurement for the hoops Mademoiselelle should wear, with the rider that in future she should stand at a more respectful distance from the Queen. Louise Fran√ßoise would never marry; dying at the Ch√¢teau d'Anet at the age of 35 having been taken ill while out riding, noted by the duc de Luynes; he noted also No sooner was she placed in her carriage than she fainted away. She never recovered consciousness, and died a few hours later. She left her profitable pensions to her first cousin √âlisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Sens; daughter of her namesake Madame la Duchesse. She was buried at the Chapel of the Ch√¢teau d'Anet; her grave was left by revolutionaries of 1789‚Äì1799. She was outlived by her two elder brothers and her mother.

It covers a broad range of topics including design, architecture, culture, the economy, politics and philosophy. Owned by Cond√© Nast Publications, it is published in London and is an offshoot of the original American Wired. History Current version (2009‚Äìpresent) The current version of the magazine was launched in April 2009, and was the second international version of Wired, after the launch of Wired Italia in March 2009. In November 2009, the British Society of Magazine Editors awarded Launch of the Year to former Wired editor David Rowan. During the same year, Albert Read was announced as publishing director of Wired UK. Wired's former deputy editor, Greg Williams took over from Rowan as editor in January 2017. Michael Rundle (formerly of Huffington Post UK) took over from Nate Lanxon as editor for WIRED.co.uk in March 2015. The current website editor is James Temperton. Both in 2011 and in 2014, Wired UK was named as the magazine of the year by the Digital Magazine Awards. Earlier version (mid‚Äì1990s) Cover of the April 1995 launch issue. The magazine's current incarnation follows an earlier attempt at a British edition of Wired which ran from April 1995 until March 1997. It was initially created as a joint venture with the Guardian Media Group and Wired USs then owners, Wired Ventures, but that incarnation lasted only three or four issues, due to a culture clash between the two parties and low sales figures of 25,000 per month. Wired Ventures then ran the UK edition alone, with an almost entirely new staff, until the magazine was closed with the March 1997 issue, when sales were at 40,000 magazines per month. Wired conference Wired UK, together with Telefonica, held a two-day event on 25‚Äì26 October 2012 at The Brewery in London. The conference was designed to \\"explore the ideas, innovations and people that are reshaping our world\\". Among its speakers were David Karp, founder of microblogging platform Tumblr, and Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian-American freelance journalist and commentator. Wired 2011, hosted between 13‚Äì14 October at the St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, included guest speakers Joanna Shields, Managing Director and Vice President of Facebook EMEA, and Gil Hirsch, founder of Face.com.

Early life and career Allen was the second son of John Hensleigh Allen of Cresselly, Pembrokeshire and his wife, Lady Gertrude Seymour, daughter of Lord Robert Seymour. His father had been MP for Pembroke and his maternal grandfather had been MP for Carmarthenshire. Allen was educated at Rugby School and at Christ Church, Oxford and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in May 1841. He was Recorder of Andover from 1859 to 1872. In 1880 he became Queen's Counsel and in 1881 a Bencher. He was JP and Chairman of the Quarter Sessions for Pembrokeshire.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 Parliamentary career Allen was elected Member of Parliament for Pembroke in 1880, and he held the seat until it was reorganised under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. In the 1885 general election, he was elected MP for Pembroke and Haverfordwest, narrowly defeating Admiral Richard Mayne. He held the seat until he stood down at the 1886 general election. Irish Home Rule and retirement from Parliament During the 1885-86 Parliament it became clear that Allen's views ran contrary to those of the more radical wing of the Liberal Party. He voted against Lewis Dillwyn's bill proposing disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales, and was absent from the division on the land reform bill introduced by Jesse Collings. To compound matters, Allen voted against Gladstone's Irish Home Rule Bill and joined the ranks of the Liberal Unionists. He was also opposed to Welsh disestablishment. Admiral Mayne had been re-adopted as Conservative candidate for Pembroke Boroughs following his narrow defeat the previous years and a suggestion was made that Allen contest the Pembrokeshire seat against William Davies with the support of the Conservatives. Meanwhile, the Conservatives of Milford Haven suggested that the party stand down in favour of Allen contesting the Boroughs as a Liberal Unionist. Allen does not appear to have seriously considered either option and it soon became known that he had decided to retire from the Commons. Shortly after the election was announced, Mayne arrived in the constituency to launch his campaign. At a meeting in Pembroke's Masonic Hall, he emphasised that he had consulted with Allen before travelling to the constituency producing a letter in his possession from Allen confirming his decision to retire. Later life and death He was elected unopposed as a member of Pembrokeshire County Council in 1889, representing the Carew ward. At the first meeting of the council, Allen gained the most votes in the election of aldermen. Soon after he became the first permanent chairman of the county council. Allen died unmarried at the age of 93.'ALLEN, Henry George', Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 26 April 2014 References  External links  * Category:1815 births Category:1908 deaths Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for Welsh constituencies Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:UK MPs 1880‚Äì1885 Category:UK MPs 1885‚Äì1886 Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn Category:People from Pembrokeshire Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Pembrokeshire constituencies ","title":"Henry George Allen"},{"id":"24433889","text":"Bruce Barton (born May 30, 1957) is an American sprint canoeist who competed in the late 1970s.

Director Ulf Andersson devised the concept for Fortress before preproduction began in the second half of 2008. During development, Square Enix approached the developer and proposed making the game a spin-off of Final Fantasy XII. Grin reconceived the game in the recurring Final Fantasy world of Ivalice, and included elements of Final Fantasy XII, such as stylistic motifs and character designs; additional elements included chocobos and other recurring creatures from the Final Fantasy series. It was to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. During development, Square Enix did not pay Grin over several months and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style. Grin worked to bring the game's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series, but after six months of development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix, and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later. Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even a tech demo surfaced. In 2011, Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio, but this was also suspended, and the game will not be released in any form. Premise According to scenario writer Ulf Andersson, the story was set several years after the events of Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings. The plot revolved a magical fortress designed to defend Ivalice from a being known as the Sea King Loemund, who rose every 10,000 years to attempt to conquer the land. During his last attempt, he was slain and his crown was lost in the fortress. Though the myth is mostly disregarded, the story is believed by Basch fon Ronsenburg, now serving the current Archadian Emperor Larsa Solidor under the name of \\"Judge Gabranth\\". Marching to the fortress' location, he and his forces would have needed to fend off the forces of Loemund, who seeks vengeance against his killer's descendant Queen Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca. A central character plot was to be a romantic connection between Basch and Ashe that would fade as Larsa and Ashe grew closer and Basch became entrenched in his fight against Loemund. Other characters involved included the sky pirate Balthier, and earlier main protagonists Vaan and Penelo. A new character, a demigod named Laegd, would join Bache after being defeated in single combat. The main aim of the story was to bring the entire cast of Final Fantasy XII back together for a final fight to save Ivalice.  Development  Gameplay combat test of two characters from the leaked tech demo Fortress started out as an original fantasy game concept designed by Ulf Andersson, Grin's co-founder. Preproduction began in the second half of 2008. Lead character artist Bj√∂rn Albihn described Fortress as \\"a game with an epic scale both in story and production values.\\" The project was developed on a game engine compatible with Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The development team, led by Andersson as a creative director, produced concept art and 3D assets under art director Anders De Geer and Albihn. The game design was led by technical artist Erik Lindqvist. The art style of the game was supposed to be realistic and similar to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim according to Guillaumue Mraz, a level designer at Grin. The game was pitched to various publishers, and the Japanese gaming company Square Enix took an interest in the project. Square Enix president Yoichi Wada visited Grin several times, and liked the action role-playing game concept and its Nordic visual style. After getting the chance to see a boss fight from Bionic Commando, which at the time was being developed by Grin for the Japanese company Capcom, Wada said he had seen enough, and decided that Square Enix would publish Fortress as a Final Fantasy spin-off. Once it became a Final Fantasy title, the Grin founders stated, \\"We wanted to come in and revolutionize Final Fantasy, which is exactly what they need.\\" Fortress was to be set in the fictional world of Ivalice, specifically the version seen in Final Fantasy XII, only set some time in the future. In addition to many original characters and locations, concept art for the game included the character Ashe and a Judge from Final Fantasy XII, as well as chocobos and other recurring creatures of the Final Fantasy series. A portfolio video created by lead technical artist Anders Bodbacka revealed that Larsa Solidor and Basch fon Ronsenburg from Final Fantasy XII were also to be featured. The setting was to be different from a normal Final Fantasy game, with familiar characters exploring a \\"Nordic\\" version of Final Fantasy, and \\"primarily set in a massive fortress\\" according to Linda Dahlberg, a Grin associate producer. Other landscapes such as plains, forests, deserts and snowfields were also designed. Invaders from the sea were to be the main enemies of the game. They were visually based on the Vikings and wielded armor and weapons decorated with sea and sea monster imagery. Planned boss battles included fighting a gargantuan version of the Final Fantasy monster Malboro, where the player would use the seaweed on its back to climb on top of it and drop bombs on the creature's weak spots. According to a design document, the game was divided into at least seven chapters, starting at the gate of the Fortress and leading up to the top of the stronghold. Grin's music director Erik Thunberg was responsible for the game's score, including a track that features a rearrangement of the \\"Prelude\\" theme from the Final Fantasy series.  Cancellation  Square Enix was supposed to pay Grin for the production of Fortress in successive waves in accordance with the project's milestones. No payments were made during the first two months of development, but Grin's co- founder Bo Andersson was initially not worried as he considered delayed payments common and had faith in the project. However, several more months went by without payments, costing the studio 12 million kr a month. Grin closed all of their offices except for the main one in Stockholm, but still no money came. In 2009, Grin released Terminator Salvation, Wanted: Weapons of Fate, and Bionic Commando to negative reviews and poor sales, which caused further financial woes and seemed to make Square Enix nervous. The publisher wanted updates and asked that all of the game's assets, including the code, the music files, and even the game's developer language be faxed to them. This move was described as impossible and \\"almost a criminal behavior\\" by Andersson. Square Enix had changed its mind, and no longer liked the Nordic style of this spin-off game, so a last-minute style change was attempted. The game had been such a well-guarded secret, and had been through so many changes, that most employees did not know they had been working on a Final Fantasy game until very late in development. Grin attempted to change the art style to fit more with traditional Final Fantasy games, but still did not receive any positive feedback. In response, Grin sent Square Enix an image of one of the latter's own games, Final Fantasy XII, and were told that it does not look like a game in Final Fantasys style. Following that exchange, Grin came to the conclusion that there was no longer any way to satisfy the publisher. In early August 2009, a call was received from Square Enix telling them that no payments were coming. Grin's founders considered suing, but had run out of money, leading them to stop production after six months of work. Furthermore, Grin ceased production on all of their other projects and declared bankruptcy due to Sweden's severe laws against operating businesses under a debt load. Magnus Ihrefors, one of the 3D artists who worked on the project, stated that he had only found out about the game's cancellation in August, but it was like a \\"punch in the belly; this was our last chance to get on track again.\\" The developer closed its offices on August 12, 2009, stating that delayed payments from \\"too many publishers\\" caused \\"an unbearable cashflow situation,\\" and referred to Fortress in a farewell note as an \\"unreleased masterpiece that [they] weren't allowed to finish.\\" According to the bankruptcy papers, Square Enix felt that the development goals for Fortress \\"had not been met in a satisfactory way,\\" whereas Andersson claimed the contrary, arguing that the milestones initially set up with a producer from Square Enix had been met. Mraz stated that Grin seemed to have ignored Square Enix's requests for changes, and the Final Fantasy franchise was too important to overlook this behavior. The Anderssons later called the game's cancellation a \\"betrayal‚Äù, and stated they have never received any payment for the initial work done on the game.  Aftermath  After Grin's closure, the former existence of Fortress spread as mentions and concept art of the project appeared on former employees' resumes and portfolios. In January 2010, footage from an alleged tech demo of Fortress was leaked onto the Internet. The video description stated the game's events are \\"set some time after Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings,\\" and mentioned Square Enix's subsidiary Eidos Montreal as a possible new home for the project. Replying to a fan question in May 2010, David Hoffman, director of business development at the North American branch of Square Enix, mentioned Fortress without confirming its existence, stating, \\"I have and had no involvement in the rumored project Fortress.\\" The Fortress project, still supported by Square Enix, was for a time being developed by a different, undisclosed studio, but this ended as well. At an interview at the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Motomu Toriyama of Square Enix stated that Fortress was suspended, saying that the game \\"won't be released.\\" In 2012, music director Erik Thunberg posted a music track intended for the game.

It today houses the National Museum of Capodimonte and art gallery of the city. \\"Capodimonte\\" means \\"top of the hill\\", and the palace was originally just outside the city, which has now expanded to surround it, and somewhat cooler than the city in summer. History In 1738, Charles VII king of Naples and Sicily (later Charles III, king of Spain) decided to build a hunting lodge on the Capodimonte hill, but then decided that he would instead build a grand palace (a Royal Palace, as in Italian \\"Reggia\\" means Royal), partly because his existing residence, the Palace of Portici, was too small to accommodate his court, and partly because he needed somewhere to house the fabulous Farnese art collection which he had inherited from his mother, Elisabetta Farnese, last descendant of the sovereign ducal family of Parma. He commissioned Angelo Carasale, Giovanni Antonio Medrano and Antonio Canevari to build it. Work started in August 1738, but it was to take more than a century to complete, partly because of the difficulty of transporting piperno, the volcanic rock used, from the quarries in Pianura. In 1758, the first part of the palace was opened and the art collection was brought in. In 1759, Ferdinand I succeeded his father Charles and the following year he appointed the architect Ferdinando Fuga to oversee work on the palace and the grounds. In 1787, on the advice of Jacob Philipp Hackert, a laboratory for the restoration of paintings was created. When the Parthenopaean Republic was declared in 1799, Ferdinand fled to Palermo on board Nelson's Vanguard, taking the most valuable items from the palace with him. What remained was looted by the French troops of General Championnet who were billeted there. During the 10 years of French occupation (1806-1815), the palace was the residence of Joseph Bonaparte and then of Joachim Murat. The art collection was transferred to the Naples National Archaeological Museum. When Ferdinand returned from Sicily in 1815, he employed many painters and sculptors to work on the decoration of the palace. Francesco I succeeded his father Ferdinand in 1825 and appointed the architect Antonio Niccolini to oversee work on the palace. Niccolini added monumental staircases, and new suites of rooms for the royal family, continuing work when Ferdinand II succeeded Francesco I in 1830. The palace was finally completed in 1840, and a gallery housing contemporary art was added. With Italian Unification, the royal palace passed in 1861 to the House of Savoy who used it as a residence and also added to the art collections, appointing Domenico Morelli as consultant for new acquisitions. They also added an extensive collection of historic firearms and other weapons. In 1866, the boudoir of Maria Amalia of Saxony was transferred to Capodimonte from the Palace of Portici, and in 1877 a Roman era marble floor was brought in from a Roman villa on Capri. In the early 20th century, the palace became the residence of the Dukes of Aosta. Then in 1920 it became the property of the Italian state. In 1950 it became a museum with many of the exhibits being returned from the National Museum.  Interior  The first and second floors house the National Gallery (Galleria Nazionale). Elsewhere in the palace the royal apartments are furnished with antique 18th century furniture and a collection of porcelain and majolica from the various royal residences. The famous Capodimonte Porcelain Factory was just adjacent to the palace; it was started in 1743 by the Bourbon King Charles.  Gardens  The palace is situated in the Bosco di Capodimonte ('Hilltop Wood'), which serves as a royal hunting preserve. There is still a pleasant park around the palace.

The team played its games at Wiedenmayer's Park in Newark, New Jersey. Newark played in the Eastern League between 1908 and 1911, and they played in the International League from 1912 to 1916. The team featured strong pitching. In 1908, Tom Hughes led the Eastern League in strikeouts. In 1909, Joe McGinnity led in wins (29), games (55) and strikeouts (195) while allowing just 297 hits in 422 innings. In 1910, McGinnity won 30 games and Rube Waddell finished with a 5-3 record. McGinnity continued as player-manager for two more years. The team won the International League pennant in 1913, but the following year they slipped to fifth. In 1915, the Indians suddenly had competition: the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the Federal League moved to town, renamed the Newark Peppers. The Indians could not compete with the major-league Peppers, and moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on July 2, 1915. The following season, the Federal League was dead and the Indians returned to Newark, even playing in the Peppers' old (but still brand-new) ballpark, Harrison Park. But the Indians finished dead last in 1916, and were replaced by the Newark Bears in 1917. (The Bears would continue playing in the old FL stadium until it burned down in 1924.)

Gottschalk (December 16, 1950 - June 21, 2003) was a resident of San Antonio, Texas who gained international notoriety in 2003 through his preference for riding his bicycle clad only in a thong. After numerous interviews, a parade, and at least one arrest, his life ended in suicide at Big Bend National Park. Early years Before his riding habits made him an \\"odd news of the day\\" item, Joseph Gottschalk‚Äîhis surname means \\"God's servant\\"http://german.about.com/library/blsurname01.htm‚Äîled an unremarkable life. He grew up in Dallas, Texas, one of six children. In 1969 at the age of 18 he attended Catholic seminary at Pontifical College Josephinum in Columbus, Ohio, but dropped out after one semester. Described as \\"nerdy, even by seminary standards,\\" Gottschalk was soon drafted into the Vietnam War effort. According to his brother Paul, Gottschalk spent most of his short Army career behind bars refusing to do \\"anything to help the war efforts.\\" He married in 1976 and divorced in 2000 after fathering four children. Thong Man Citing an appreciation for personal liberty and the human form, Gottschalk began riding his bicycle clad only in a thong in April or May 2003. At first he restricted his rides to his south side San Antonio neighborhood, particularly Southside Lions Park, but with time he expanded his routes north into the downtown area. The San Antonio Express-News newspaper published a storyhttps://web.archive.org/web/20031031085528/http://news.mysanantonio.com/story.cfm?xla=saen&xlb;=180&xlc;=991269&xld;=180 on him in their May 5, 2003 metro section that was picked up by the Associated Press and quickly went viral bringing him fame far beyond his own city's limits.http://www.mountainbike.co.nz/politics/caw/ww_0305.html Locally Thong Man, as Gottschalk came to be known, provoked both admiration and disgust. For himself, Gottschalk seemed to enjoy pushing the boundaries of public taste and compared his riding wardrobe preferences to driving the maximum legal speed limit. In response to being labeled a pervert, Gottschalk decried judgment that \\"(based) morality on appearance.\\" In time he gained a kind of cult hero status among a minority of San Antonians, enough so that on May 23, 2003 he was f√™ted as grand marshal of a parade sponsored by a local radio station. Arrest On June 17, 2003, Gottschalk was arrested for indecent exposure.https://web.archive.org/web/20040121235451/http://news.mysanantonio.com/story.cfm?xla=saen&xlb;=180&xlc;=1013635& According to the police report, Gottschalk had forsaken his usual cycling attire for a \\"tan bag\\" which left his anus exposed when he stood up on his bicycle. He was released the following day on 100 dollars bond vowing to fight his Class B misdemeanor offense. It was a question of legality destined to remain unresolved. Death On June 21, 2003 a group of hikers in Big Bend National Park discovered Gottschalk's naked mortal remains at the bottom of a 100-foot drop along the South Rim Loop trail.Death In Big Bend The San Antonio Express-News editorial page mourned the loss stating: \\"Thong Man will be remembered as one of the many colorful, off-beat characters of Alamo City lore.\\" Brewster County Justice of the Peace Shirley Williams declared his death a suicide after a month-long investigation.

The film premiered on July 10, 2009 at the Revelation Perth International Film Festival in Australia. Plot In the not too distant future, society has levied laws against smoking and forced citizens to live in a certain part of town called the \\"SMOKING SECTION\\" if one wants to smoke cigarettes. After crossing the line into the smoking ghetto, Cigarettes now cost $63.49 a pack, and are sold on the street corners and underground bars. The unnamed heroine (Cori Dials) of the film works in the \\"Vice Club\\", an abandoned 1930s era cigarette factory turned club, where a once iconic emblem of a giant cigarette tipping over into a giant ashtray, now sits atop the factory coated with rust like a cancer. Occasionally still tilting into the astray if the wind is strong enough, the giant cigarette squeaks like a siren, going throughout the city. We find the heroine, after her grandmother (Helen Bowman) is hospitalized with emphysema, the Cigarette Girl attempts to break her addiction to nicotine while also escaping the clutches of her employers, the mob-associated operators of the smoker hangout, the Vice Club. Deciding to start packing a pistol along with her packs of cigarettes, the Cigarette Girl becomes an angel of death when she stops smoking and starts killing on the third day to alleviate her acute psychological withdrawal manifested primarily by the ghost of a cowboy who is always on her back to keep smoking.

Reception \\"Both sex and violence are embodied in the fishnet film-noir presence of the striking Dials, 28, a McCarthy 5-foot-9 'starlet' who works as an intern mortician in a Virginia funeral home when she's not stalking through McCarthy's eccentric mise-en- scene or singing lead vocals in his rock group, Fingers Like Saturn.\\" Written by John Beifuss in the Commercial Appeal on September 7, 2009. \\"Everything in Cigarette Girl orbits around Dials, though. McCarthy demands a lot from her in what might be considered something of a superhero origin story. She is asked to be an iconic presence, and she delivers. Dials is a spectacle even when not stripped down to bra, panties, and fishnets. Her palpable combination of toughness and vulnerability makes her character click.\\" Written by Chris Herrington on Sept. 10, 2009. \\"Pure 'smokesploitation,' CIGARETTE GIRL mixes misfit social commentary with beautiful babes and bad boys, guns and glamour, and lots of cigarettes, all shot with the feel of a classic drive-in grindhouse roughie. McCarthy's works include the crowd pleasing SORE LOSERS and TEENAGE TUPELO, regarded as a classic of the underground-into-indie film scene of the '90s. CIGARETTE GIRL looks like it will be his biggest film to date.\\" Live from Memphis on Aug. 20, 2009. \\"'Cigarette Girl' epitomizes guerrilla indie film by experimenting liberally with the medium. It employs hazy, green-toned imagery and dilapidated settings. The retro d√©cor of the sets and the rockabilly costumes feel natural in the world McCarthy has created. It looks like a sleazy dystopian hell to the square crowd, but the progressive viewer will appreciate the detailed fantasy world, rich with atmosphere and attitude.\\" Small Town Critic on Sept. 11, 2009. \\"Cigarette Girl, American indie director, Mike McCarthy‚Äôs first feature film since Superstartlet AD in 2000, was shot in Memphis over eleven days and is a noirish, low budget genre piece that has parallels with exploitation-oriented films such as Tarantino‚Äôs Kill Bill diptych. The lead is a strong, kickass, take-no-prisoners type who, through the film, despite its being set in future times, wears the 1940s cigarette girl nightclub uniform - lacy crinoline skirt, corset, fishnet stockings, and stiletto heels - and drives a black 1970 Cadillac Deville. She is both tender and compassionate whilst being equally willing and able to dole out justice to anyone who wrongs her.\\" Written by Shannon O'Neil on Cinephilia. \\"Cori Dials and Michael McCarthy caused great interest with their special brand of Memphis styled exploitation with Cigarette Girl\\" Monster Year Ends on Revelation Perth International Film Festival, July 14, 2009.

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, published by Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI) in the United States in 1977. Gameplay It was the first wargame to cover the entire conflict depicted in the story (starting from the Fellowship's departure from Rivendell), as opposed to a single battle from it. The game was primarily intended to be played by two players, with the Fellowship player taking the side of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth and the Dark Power player controlling the forces of Sauron and his subordinates. The published game also had abbreviated rules for a three-player version with one player taking the role of Saruman; a fuller version of these rules was printed in issue #37 of Moves magazine. Like most SPI wargames, it is played on a map with a hex grid imposed upon it to regulate movement, using small cardboard counters to represent the units. There are also many cards with data on characters, monsters, and magic items, as well as playable events from the story and a deck to regulate Sauron's searches for the Fellowship. The game can be played in one of two modes. The simpler is the Character Game, which covers only the quest by the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring. In the Character Game the only units controlled by each player are, for the Fellowship player, the members of the Fellowship, and for the Dark Power player, the nine Nazg√ªl, Saruman, the Mouth of Sauron, and possibly Gollum (should he manage to acquire the Ring). The Fellowship player attempts to transport the Ring to Mount Doom, while the Dark Power player attempts to locate the Fellowship, seize the Ring, and take it to Barad-dur. The Dark Power also has the option of winning a military victory, played out by moving Nazg√ªl to various important Fellowship- controlled fortresses and rolling dice see if they are captured (an abstract way of playing out the military campaigns of the war). The more complex mode of play is the Campaign Game, which adds in army units for both sides as well as other characters from the story who were involved in the military campaigns. An odds-ratio combat system is used to play out combat between armies. Players can win with their Ring-based objective from the Character game or by capturing a specified list of objectives with their armies. Characters in the game are rated for their abilities in individual combat, magic, army leadership, endurance, and resistance to the lure of the Ring. The latter rating determines the difficulty they have of voluntarily removing the Ring once they put it on; they gain various benefits by wearing it, but if they do so for too many turns, they become a \\"semi-Ringwraith\\" under Dark Power control. To simulate Sauron's conflicting needs of searching for the Ring versus directing his armies, the Dark Power player is given a variable number of \\"Shadow Points\\" each turn, which they spend to perform various activities. Among these is searching for the Fellowship; although the hex locations of various Fellowship members are known, their identity is not (their counters are kept upside-down), and Sauron must perform search actions with Nazg√ªl or orcs to identify the characters, and to spot them so they can be fought or captured. Which areas of the map can be searched, and with what forces, is controlled by a small deck of cards. Reception Although the game was popular in its day, and won the Charles S. Roberts Award for Best Fantasy Board Game of 1977, it has been criticized for having an optimal strategy for the Dark Power player. Since the only realistically achievable way for the Fellowship player to win is to destroy the Ring, the Dark Power player can simply stack all nine Nazg√ªl on Mount Doom, attempt to spot the Fellowship when it enters the hex (with a good chance of success), and if successful, conduct a series of individual combats to attempt to take the Ring. The Dark Power player has a greater chance of taking the ring this way than by engaging the Fellowship with fewer Nazg√ªl, as they would have to using the normal search mechanism. As a result, the design has been faulted for having the entire game be decided by an enormous brawl atop Mount Doom. Tony Zamparutti reviewed War of the Ring in The Space Gamer No. 16. Zamparutti commented that \\"War of the Rings is not only a fun game, but a fairly good recreation of the events in LOTR.\\" David Ritchie reviewed War of the Ring in Ares Magazine #1, rating it a 7 out of 9. Ritchie commented that \\"Games of War of the Ring range from predictable to cliff-hanging, gut-wrenching suspense. Fairly complex, and requires several hours to play.

He embedded the principle of Positive Thinking in computers and invented the Rule Based Object Oriented technology for developing data processing applications, the development of which he started in the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1972.Profile of Tsvi Misinai ‚Äì Ariel Center for policy research (ACPR) Misinai self-identifies as a secular Jew and currently resides in Rehovot. Misinai first heard about the \\"Hebrew origins of Palestinians\\" theory from his father, Kha'yim Avraham, who served in the Royal Artillery in the Second World War. His interest was rekindled after the 1991 Gulf War, when there was talk about a new order in the Middle East. After the failure of the Oslo Accords that led to the commencement of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in 2000, he abandoned his career as a Computer scientist and devoted his entire life to investigating the Jewish roots of Palestinians. He now spends his entire time tracking down Palestinians who acknowledge their Jewish heritage, and lobbying ministers, ambassadors, religious leaders and activists in both communities. Misinai, and his team of Arabs and Jews, have embarked on a mission of trying to bring peace to Israel through a unique and controversial project called \\"The Engagement\\". Project on Palestinians Hebrew origin Background Tsvi Misinai claims that the majority of the Palestinian people‚Äîincluding those with Israeli citizenship or residency, known variously as Arab citizens of Israel, Arab Israelis, Israeli Arabs, including the Bedouin Arabs of Israel‚Äîare descendants of the ancient Hebrews, as most of the world's Jewish ethnic divisions are. Furthermore, he claims that at least half of them are quietly aware of this fact.Arabs of Jewish Descent in Israel ‚Äì 9 August 2009, Israel National News According to Misinai, unlike the ancestors of the modern day Jews who were city dwellers to a large extent, the Hebrew ancestors of the Palestinians were rural dwellers, and were allowed to remain in the land of Israel to work the land and supply Rome with grain and olive oil. Misinai states the topic of Hebrew origin was spoken of openly by Palestinians until relatively recent history, much like the Egyptians or Lebanese are aware of their origins in the ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians respectively, even if these ancestral origin topics arouse the passions in those countries among those wishing to either stress or de- emphasise them. As with other \\"Arabs\\" whose local indigenous non-Arab origins became relegated issues over time, the Hebrew origin of Palestinians also became a relegated issue over time. For the Palestinians, however, the additional emergence of Zionism in the early 19th century introduced a quandary complicating an unbiased assessment to either acknowledge or deny the local indigenous non-Arab ancestry of a culturally and linguistically Arabized people. In the context of the Palestinians, this quandary was a competing national interest in the land they inhabited. Arab nationalism for Palestinians would thus serve as a counter-force vis-√†-vis Zionism. The topic of the Palestinians‚Äô ancestral Hebrew origin thus became admonished. Then, the establishment of modern Israel by world Jewry, having transpired to the detriment of the Palestinians, transformed the topic of the Palestinians‚Äô Hebrew origin into a liability in the historical narrative for either side to admit, ultimately becoming the object of outright hostility. Conversions and Arabization As a result of remaining in the Land of Israel, the ancestors of the Palestinians partially converted to Christianity during the Byzantine era. Later, with the coming of Islam, they were Islamized through a combination of mainly forced conversions, but also nominal conversions (that is, conversions for form's sake to derive benefits as Muslims, and avoid tributes owed by non-Muslims in Muslim-ruled lands) and others yet out of genuine theological conviction. Conversion to Islam occurred progressively throughout the successive periods of foreign elite minority rule over Palestine, both on an individual basis and en masse, starting with the conversions during the various dynasties of Arabian Muslim rulers from the initial Muslim conquest of Palestine. Following these came rule by Muslim non- Arab dynasties such as the Ayyubids (Kurdish Muslim), Mamluks (Turkic Muslim) and finally the Ottomans (Turkish Muslim). This continuous phase of elite minority foreign Islamic rule over a local indigenous (now largely Muslim) mass was only briefly interrupted by the elite minority foreign Christian rule by the European Crusaders, which lasted from 1099 until their expulsion by the Mameluks in 1291. Standing before the Sapiens building in Rehovot, Misinai and Ovadia Yerushalmi, a Bedouin Jew and key Engagement Movement activist from the Banu Sawarka tribe Misinai states that of this gradual process of conversions (often accompanied by Arabization), the majority were forcibly converted during the Fatimid era under the reign of Caliph al-Hakim who was crowned at the age of 11, and reigned from the years 996 to 1021. Due to his young age, in practice, it was his ministers who wielded the actual power behind the throne for some time. They gave the young Caliph power to influence religious matters only, and appointed him as Imam. In 1009, the extremists among his ministers gained the upper hand and brought upon a series of decrees against Christians and Jews. In 1012, the al-Hakem Edict was issued, under which all Jews and Christians in Palestine were ordered to either convert to Islam or leave. This led to the majority of non-Hebrew origin Christians (i.e., foreign Christians) to leave Palestine, while over 90 per cent of Jews, Samaritans (also of Hebrew origin) and Hebrew-origin Christians converted and became Muslims. They would also become Musta'arabim (Arabized), acculturated into Arab language, custom and culture.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 69 Later, when the edict was finally repealed in 1044 during the reign of Caliph Al-Mustansir of Cairo, only 27 percent of the Jewish converts to Islam returned to Judaism openly, although they too would remain Musta‚Äôarabi (culturally and linguistically Arab). The remainder continued to live as Muslim crypto-Jews in order to continue enjoying the economic advantages of Muslims, such as exemption from paying jizya and kharaj, the ability to sell their agricultural products to the foreign authorities, or gain employment in the government machinery. Many younger persons of Hebrew-origin (Jewish, Christian or Samaritan) saw it simultaneously possible to lead dual lives, incorporating their prior faith while being outwardly Muslim, and accruing material benefits.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 73 Later, with the advent of Mamluk rule, Judaism had reached a breaking point in Palestine. Backing In his 1928 anthropological work, Arabs in Eretz Israel, Israel Belkind, a pioneer of the First Aliyah, advanced the claim that the Palestinian Arabs were descended from the ancient Hebrews.Israel Belkind, \\"Arabs in Eretz Israel\\", Hermon Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1969, p.8 Tsvi Misinai validates his theory of the Hebrew origin of Palestinians on the basis of various findings in terms of historic-demographic, historic-geographic, national-territorial, genetic, behavioural-religious, nomenclature and linguistics, and Palestinian cultural and oral traditions.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 300 In his book Brother shall not lift sword against brother, he details numerous testimonies of their Jewish ancestry by Palestinians and Bedouins, and cites the anthropological studies conducted by Israel Belkind, one of the organizers of the Bilu movement, David Ben-Gurion and Yitzhak Ben-Zvi (both the first Prime Minister and the second President of Israel, respectively). Misinai also cites the following three genetic studies as lending credence to his theory. Among the genetic studies referred to by him include recent genetic studies conducted by Professor Ariella Oppenheim of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem on the male Y chromosome which revealed that the present day Jews and Palestinians represent modern descendants of a core population that lived in the area now constituting the state of Israel and the Palestinian territories, since prehistoric times.Hammer, et al. Figure 2: Plot of populations based on Y-chromosome haplotype data. In 2001, the Human Immunology magazine published a genetic study conducted by Prof. Antonio Arnez-Vilna, a Spanish researcher from the Complutense University of Madrid, who discovered that the immune systems of the Jews and the Palestinians are extremely close to one another in a way that almost absolutely demonstrates a similar genetic identity. Furthermore, a 2002 test by Tel Aviv University researchers, determined that only two groups in the world‚ÄîAshkenazi Jews and Palestinians‚Äîwere genetically susceptible to an inherited deafness syndrome. Classification of the Palestinians Tsvi Misinai separates the Palestinian people into three main groups; the \\"Descendants of Israel\\", \\"Brethren of Israel\\" and \\"Palestinians of miscellaneous origins\\". He states that until recently, there had been very few inter-marriages between these groups, as Palestinians usually tended to marry within their own clans or related clans.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 295 Descendants of Israel The \\"Descendants of Israel\\", he claims, comprise descendants of the ancient biblical Hebrews which are native to the land west of the Jordan River (the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Israel proper). They are more specifically descended from the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Judah, as opposed to the Samaritans who are mainly descended from the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Israel. Misinai claims that the Descendants of Israel had ceased to call themselves Musta‚Äôarbim, when the Brethren of Israel returned to their homeland during the 18th and 19th centuries. Despite this, stories about the Jewish origins of the family were passed on among the Descendants of Israel, and a few Jewish customs were preserved. Both groups began seeing themselves as one people, although endogamous marriages with their own clans ensured the purity of their blood lines until very recently.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 115 =Samaritans= Samaritan High Priest with the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet Samaritan Torah, Nablus, c. 1920. The Samaritans are distinguished among Descendants of Israel, given that their ancient history serves as an analogous precursor to the present situation that Tsvi Misinai argues exists between world Jewry and the Palestinians‚Äîthat upon their returns from exile and re- establishments of Israel, world Jewry misidentified as foreigners the descendants of those Israelites who had stayed behind, first in antiquity misidentifying the Samaritans as foreigners, and today in modern times misidentifying the Palestinians (Arabized Hebrews of the Muslim and Christian faiths) as foreigners. The Samaritans are Descendants of Israel, being descended from farmers among the Israelite Tribes, part of whom were never exiled by the Assyrians or the Babylonians during the period of the destruction of the First Jewish Commonwealth. Their maternal lineages, however, derive from the Small Nations (those who came from Cuthah and others) who were exiled to Samaria by the Assyrians and intermixed with their paternal Israelite ancestors. The alien minority who remained in the land, adopted the Israelite religion (Samaritanism, the sister Israelite religion to Judaism) in the course of time, after the destruction of the First Temple. A portion of the Samaritans exiled by the Assyrians, were later repatriated by the prophet Jeremiah in the days of the Judean king Josiah.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 32‚Äì33 The Babylonians, who followed the Assyrians as the dominant entity in the Fertile Crescent, exiled many Samaritans but skipped over a significant part of the Samaritan population. By the time they arrived in Samaria, the Babylonians found many alien elements in the land of Israel. Consequently, they did not undertake a thorough ethnic cleansing expulsion from Samaria, since the Assyrians had led many areas to be viewed as places whose indigenous population had already been replaced by aliens and needed no further expulsion. Later, when the exiled Israelites (now known as Jews) returned from the Babylonian exile under prophets Ezra and Nehemiah, they misidentified the Israelites who had stayed behind (now known as Samaritans) as foreigners. The reason for the misidentification was because the deportations had led the exiled Israelites and the Israelites who remained behind to develop in different ways. The Babylonian captivity had a number of serious effects on the exiled Israelites (Jews), their religion (Judaism) and their culture. Included among the most obvious of these changes was replacing the original Paleo-Hebrew alphabet (see also Samaritan script) with what is in fact a stylised form of the Aramaic alphabet (now commonly called the \\"Hebrew alphabet\\" because it is the normative form in which Hebrew is written due to Jewish numeric superiority), changes in the fundamental practices and customs of the Jewish religion, the culmination of Biblical prophecy (in the Jewish prophet Ezekiel), the compilation of not only of the Talmud and Halakha (Jewish religious law, absent in Samaritanism) but also the incorporation of Nevi'im (Prophets) and Ketuvim (Writings) as a part of the cannon together with the Torah (in Samaritanism, only the Torah is canonical, see Samaritan Torah), and the emergence of scribes and sages as Jewish leaders (see Ezra and the Pharisees). These resulting differences in religious practices between returnees and those who remained in Israel led to a schism in the Israelites, and whenceforth the creation of separate Samaritan and Jewish entities. Over the centuries, Judaism and world Jewry have come to the acceptance that the Samaritans are indeed descendants of Israelites. The Islamic conquest of Palestine in the first half of the 7th century, and the subsequent Arab rule, marked the beginning of the phase of decline and erosion of Samaritan identity, even more detrimentally than the extreme toll on Jewish identity. The passing of the aforementioned al-Hakem Edict in 1021, along with another notable forced conversion to Islam imposed at the hands of the rebel Ibn Firasa, decreased their numbers significantly, such that they decreased from more than a million in Roman times to just 712 people today. For those who maintained a Samaritan identity and religious association into modern times, they too, like their Palestinian counterparts who had additionally adopted Christianity and later Islam, were nevertheless thoroughly Arabized in language and culture. After the establishment of modern Israel, Samaritans living in what became the State of Israel replaced Palestinian Arabic with modern Hebrew as their day to day language (although Samaritan Hebrew had always been maintained as the liturgical language, along with liturgical Samaritan Aramaic and liturgical Samaritan Arabic). Brethren of Israel The \\"Brethren of Israel\\", which are originally native to the land east of the Jordan River (the East Bank, that is, modern-day Jordan) comprise the descendants of the brother nations of the Hebrews, i.e., the ancient Edomites, Ammonites and Moabites who variously converted to Judaism and moved to Israel before the Roman invasion, and were later forcibly converted together with the \\"Descendants of Israel\\" first to Christianity and then Islam.Edomites, Moabites, Jews, Palestinians ‚Äì the 'salad' of the Jewish people? ‚Äì Jerusalem Post, 20 August 2009 Misinai states that the history of the Brethren of Israel is mostly intertwined with those of the Descendants of Israel. The Moabites, the Ammonites and the Edomites were forcibly converted to Judaism and made an extension of the Israelite nation during the course of King David‚Äôs conquests. Despite this, their kings were allowed to continue to directly hold the reins of power, and they were not incorporated into any of the Israelite tribes. In the case of the Edomites, their fierce opposition to Israelite occupation led King David to order the killing of all male Edomites. Thus, the women in Edom had no alternative but to marry members of the Israelite garrison and other Israelites. As a result, the bloodlines of Edomites from that point onwards were partially Hebrew. After the destruction of the First Jewish Commonwealth by the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar, a considerable part of the Edomites and Moabites were exiled together with the Israelites. The majority of the Ammonites were exiled and those who remained were assimilated into the Moabite communities. The kinship between the Brethren of Israel, and the Israelites continued throughout the period of the Second Commonwealth and henceforth. However, after the destruction of the First Commonwealth and the absence of the hegemony of an Israelite regime, the Moabites and Edomites discarded their affiliation to the people of Israel and left Judaism en masse. To bring them back into the fold, the Hasmonean leaders decided to re-convert them a second time. The mass Judaization campaign was started by John Hyrcanus with the conversion of the Moabites and was ended by Alexander Jannaeus who completed the conversion of the Moabites and also the Edomites after he added their territory to his Kingdom. For the next 1,600 years, these Brethren of Israel continued to be an inseparable part of the People of Israel. The Edomites and Moabites (along with the Samaritans) participated in the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War and inflicted more damage on their enemies, relative to their small numbers, than the Jews.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 30‚Äì31 Since the Edomites and Moabites ancestral lands were located east of the Jordan River, this made them more close to Arabia and more removed from the Jewish people. As a result, they were more susceptible to conversions to Islam, and hence, subsequently became Musta‚Äôarbim. When devastating famines broke out at the beginning of the 16th century, many among these Brethren of Israel emigrated to Persia. As a result of juggling different religious identities to avoid persecution, they eventually forgot their Jewish and Musta‚Äôarbi origins and became radicalised, and started considering themselves to be Arabs.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 113 Later, as things improved in the 18th and 19th century, many of those who left returned from Persia, Yemen and Sudan, shifting residences between present day Jordan and Israel, with the former mountain dwellers returning to their ancient homes, and the Edomites, Moabites, etc., settling in the plains. It is these \\"Brethren of Israel\\", Misinai contends, who constitute most of the Palestinian population east of the Jordan river and the Palestinian refugees (both within the Palestinian territories and outside), while the majority of Palestinians who did not flee and remain in Israel proper, West Bank and Gaza area, are \\"Descendants of Israel\\".Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 119 Misinai traces the beginning of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict and a Palestinian \\"Arab\\" identity to the simultaneous immigration of the Jews from various places and Brethren of Israel (from the east), to the land west of the Jordan river from 1840 to 1947. He states that by 1914 the Brethren of Israel became a very large group among Palestinians there and would remain so, until they were mostly expelled during the Palestinian exodus in 1948.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 144 He argues that these people have now returned to their ancestral homeland east of the Jordan river, and possess no right to the land of Israel.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 314 Misinai states it is this group that are the most anti-semitic and most active in terrorist activities in the intifada, with their objectives being to return to the lands they abandoned in 1948. He claims that the leadership of the Palestinian militant organisations such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, Fatah al-Islam, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, etc., are primarily internally supported by over 1,300,000 Brethren of Israel, who all reside west of the Jordan river. The victims of such terrorist acts tend to be the People of Israel, the Descendants of Israel and a small number of others. According to Misinai, the Brethren of Israel are the smartest group among the Palestinian people and make up the majority of the Palestinian leadership. He states that the early leadership of the various Palestinian nationalist organisations such as Fatah, PLO, PFLP, etc., came primarily from among the Brethren of Israel refugees in the 1948 exodus. While he acknowledges that the Brethren of Israel have suffered more than any other Palestinians, he blames the Brethren of Israel leadership of perpetuating the problem for more than 50 years in order to gain camp followers both among those of their brethren who continue to suffer and among the Arabs and others who feel sorry for them.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 311‚Äì312 Others A Druze man in Peki'in, Israel. Misinai claims that the Druze are partially of Jewish descent. In addition to these two main components, there also include a significantly small percentage of Arabs, descendants of the soldiers who served in the occupying Roman army after the destruction of the Second Temple and even some survivors of the ancient Canaanite and Philistine who are idol worshipers that live in Gaza and in the village of Jisr az-Zarka, near Haifa. A minuscule percentage of Palestinians are also descendants of 500 European Crusaders who stayed behind in Palestine and converted to Islam. These Crusaders, he indicates, are the source of the smatterings of blond haired and blue-eyed Palestinians one witnesses today.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 90 The various entities among the neighbouring small nations of gentiles, such as the Philistines, Canaanites, Jebusites, Amorites, Hivites and Perizzites inhabited the remainder of the historical region of Canaan, from which the Hebrews under Joshua had driven them off and carved out a nation for themselves called Israel. These nations were all eventually vanquished by King David and made a part of the Kingdom of Israel. A large number were later exiled by King Nebuchadnezzar in the course of the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah and the Babylonian exile. A mass Judaization process in Israel in the course of the Hasmonean Period left only a handful of Philistines, Canaanites and other members of the Small Nations. Since conversion was not imposed on remnants of these Small Nations who had been Hellenized, they continued to worship Greek deities. They were forced to nominally accept Christianity during the Byzantine period, and later finally expelled by Caliph Al-Hakim during the Fatimid rule, together with the majority of the Christian descendants of the Roman Army and almost all the Christian Arabs.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 247‚Äì48 A few hundred, however, remained and their descendants constitute the small numbers of idol worshippers who live in Israel in modern times. These include a few Canaanites that reside in the village of Jisr az-Zarqa near Caesarea, a few thousand Philistines and Canaanites in Gaza, and descendants of the Phoenicians in the form of Maronite Catholics (primarily the refugees from Ikrit and Kafr Bir'im). Misinai also claims that the Druze of Israel, Syria and Lebanon are partially of Jewish descent, along with Arab, Midianite, Assyrian and Egyptian origins.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 128 He further states that there were Jewish villages that became part of the Druze community, mostly to avoid being forcibly converted to Islam, such as the residents of the Western Galilee villages of Abu Snein and Yarka.MK Kara: Druze are Descended from Jews ‚Äì 25 October 2010, Israel National News Proportion of Hebrew-descended Palestinians Yatta, southern Mount Hebron Tsvi Misinai claims that nearly 90 per cent of the Palestinian people living in Israel proper and the occupied territories are of Hebrew descent (with the percentage among the population of the Gaza Strip being higher than 90 per cent),The lost Palestinian Jews - 20 August 2009, Jerusalem post but a greatly reduced percentage among Palestinian refugees living outside those areas.The Engagement booklet: The roots and solution to the problem in the Holy land ‚Äî p. 14, Tsvi Misinai In his book Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Misinai puts forward the following statistics pertaining to the proportion of the \\"Descendants of Israel\\" and the \\"Brethren of Israel\\" populations among the Palestinians and Arab Israelis, as of December 2007. It is detailed as four main areas (Judea and Samaria, Gaza strip, East Jerusalem and Israel proper) and are as follows: * In Judea and Samaria‚Äînot counting East Jerusalem, the number of permanent residents was 956,000, of which over 580,000 (61 per cent) were Descendants of Israel. Another 27 per cent were 259,000 Brethren of Israel (of whom were 158,000 descendants of the Edomites and 101,000 descendants of the Moabites). The remainder included 43,000 Arabs (4.5 per cent), 44,000 descendants of the Roman Army, 24,000 Christians from Distant Places and 6,000 Kurds.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 391‚Äì400 * In the Gaza Strip, there were 891,000 permanent residents, including Bedouin. Out of the non- Bedouin, 275,000 were Descendants of Israel, 520,000 were Brethren of Israel (approximately 270,000 descendants of the Moabites and approximately 250,000 descendants of the Edomites), 43,000 descendants of the Roman Army, 4,000 Arabs who live in the Jabali‚Äôya refugee camp; 3,400 Canaanites and 2,700 Philistines all living in Gaza city, and 3,000 Druze that live in the Dir al- Balakh refugee camp. Among the Descendants of Israel in the Gaza Strip, 30,000 are descendants of the Samaritans and 245,000 (27.5 per cent) are descendants of authentic Jews. The population of the Gaza Strip also includes 40,000 Bedouin. The internal distribution of the Gaza Bedouin is 18,000 descendants of Moabites, 14,000 descendants of Edomites and 8,000 Descendants of Israel. In addition to the Bedouin, the total number of the Descendants of Israel is 283,000 (32 per cent), of the Brethren of Israel is 552,000 (62 per cent, 288,000 or 32 per cent descendants of Moabites and 264,000 or 30 per cent descendants of Edomites). * Of the 200,000 non-Jewish residents of East Jerusalem, 82,000 are Descendants of the People of Israel, out of which 2,000 are descendants of Samaritans living in the Samaritan neighbourhood, A-Sumera or Al-Abid. Out of this group, 7,000 are Christians. Some 48,000 are descendants of Kurds who came during the reign of Saladin. Over 32,000 are Brethren of Israel (24,000 descendants of the Moabites and 8,000 descendants of the Edomites). Some 27,000 are of Arab origin, and constitute the main concentration of population of Arab origin among Israeli citizens today. This includes 9,000 members of the veteran Arab settlers, and 14,000 descendants of the Arab Army living in the Mount of Olives neighbourhood. There are also another 11,000 inhabitants who are recognised as non-Arab citizens: 5,000 Armenians and 6,000 non-Arab Christians from various distant locations. * Within Israel proper, 642,000 (45.5 per cent) out of 1,413,000 non-Jewish residents within the Green Line (not counting East Jerusalem) are Descendants of the People of Israel. Some 457,000 are Brethren of Israel in the State of Israel (and another 32,000 in Jerusalem), or 36 per cent of all the Palestinians there (489,000 or 34.5 per cent, including Jerusalem). A further breakdown of this figure shows that the descendants of the Edomites number 166,000, and constitute 13 per cent (of the Palestinians in the State of Israel, or 174,000 or 12.5 per cent, with Jerusalem). The descendants of the Moabites number 291,000, and constitute 23 per cent (315,000 or 22 per cent with Jerusalem). The sum total of veteran inhabitants who are neither Palestinian nor Jewish is 140,000 and includes 121,000 Druze and 19,000 foreigners from Distant Places. The descendants of the Roman Army number 150,000, or 12 per cent (10.5 percent with Jerusalem). The rest, some 16,000, or 1.25 per cent, are Arabs, (43,000 or 3 per cent with Jerusalem). The number of Palestinians within the Green Line is 1,273,000. Among the Palestinians (i.e., those without Israeli citizenship) within the Green Line (not including East Jerusalem) the percentage who are Descendants of the People of Israel is close to 50.5 per cent. Views on Palestinian identity and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict Tsvi Misinai denies the existence of a separate Palestinian people as a historical identity and dismisses it as an utter fabrication. He views the Palestinian nationality as a modern socio-political construct propped up by imperialist Arab Baathist regimes, as a means of claiming rights to the land of Israel and fight the Jews. He also blames them for accentuating hostilities between the Jews and Palestinians. In his book, Misinai asserts that the Palestinian people are a part and parcel of the people of Israel, and that no other party, including an Arab one, possesses the right to compete with the rights of the People of Israel over western Eretz Yisrael and their historical kinship with most Palestinians.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 313 Misinai claims that the Palestinian national identity is not developed, for most Palestinians think of it in religious terms, not territorial. He states that their identity today is only Islamic and that there is a need for them to obtain a modern identity, which is Israeli. He asserts that this modern identity can never be Palestinian, as the country never had such an historical identity and as most Palestinians are themselves the progeny of the ancient Hebrews. Misinai labels the name \\"Palestine\\" as two huge bluffs, both a semantic bluff of the name Palestine and a genetic bluff as Palestine indicates that the modern day Palestinians are scions of the Philistines. Misinai puts forward widespread ignorance about the true Jewish identity of the Palestinians or attempts to hide it, coupled with terrorism, as the root causes in escalating the conflict. He asserts that this is what prevents their liberation and preserves their enslavement within an occupation by a false Arab identity. Misinai claims that even though, many Palestinians are aware of their Jewish origins, they rarely speak about this, and their vast majority does nothing to change their status. Those living under a Palestinian terror regime are deterred from speaking on this subject openly, for fear of being harmed. Many Palestinian parents who aware of their Jewish origins usually don't tell their children. Furthermore, families suspected of Jewish origins are forced to prove their loyalty as Arabs by aiding terrorists and giving their children patriotic names such as Jihad. Such behaviour deters Jews from establishing ties with such families. Even among Israeli Arabs there is a fear of discussion, primarily due to conventions on both sides and particularly the disbelief they would encounter among Jews. They fear that if they try and promote their claim, the Jews will think they are trying to improve their inferior status under false pretenses.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 297‚Äì298 He believes that both his findings and the genetic evidence gathered by Ariella Oppenheim and others render the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict redundant, as it proves that the whole of Israel and the occupied territories belong to both the so-called \\"recognised Jews\\" and \\"unrecognised Jews\\". Misinai also believes that given the option, most Palestinians would support a one-state solution. He also claims that most Palestinians do not hate Jews and are interested in peace with Israel. He claims that many are opposed to the Jewish presence in the Palestinian territories, because the issue has been hijacked by groups‚Äîthe leadership of the Arab world, and Palestinians (both the Brethren of Israel and the Descendants of Israel) who have forgotten their Jewish origins. The primary sin of Zionism, according to Misinai, is the suppression of the historic truth about the Jewish origins of the majority of Palestinians, and ignoring his findings and its ramifications.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 318 He asserts that most of the Palestinians who together with the Jews possess historical rights to Israel have become hostages of descendants of foreigners in their own homeland who control their lives, force terrorism upon them and control the cash designated for Palestinians. Misinai also states that the number of refugees has been deliberately blown out of proportions and that there are far fewer refugees than is widely believed. To this, he attributes the Palestinians' taking advantage of UNRWA's largesse, which gives out free food and aid without asking questions and deliberate gross inflation in the number of refugees by Palestinians themselves.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 218 \\"The Engagement\\": A solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict Concept Engagement Movement logo In contrast to the two commonly discussed solutions to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict‚Äîa two state solution (i.e., two states for two people) vs. a one state solution (i.e., a binational state, one state for two peoples)‚ÄîMisinai believes that the only solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict is a third option: a \\"one state solution for one people.\\" This \\"one state\\" integrates Israel proper with the West Bank and Gaza Strip as one territorial unit, while the \\"one people\\" consists of both groups being bound and re-defined as one united Israeli-Hebrew nation. To this end, he argues it is imperative that the majority of Palestinians reclaim their ethnic Hebrew heritage, although he states that this does not mean reverting to Judaism (neither de-Islamization for Palestinian Muslims, nor de-Christianization for Palestinian Christians, etc.), nor does it mean cultural de-Arabization. Instead, it means the adoption of a national consciousness that acknowledges a common Hebrew origin that embraces all those of such a descent, no matter what their current religion, be they Jewish, Muslim, Christian, or Samaritan, and no matter what their culture. Indeed, already, among the different Jewish ethnic divisions, each has its own traditional community language and distinct traditional culture. It is the amalgam of this diversity that forms Jewish Israeli culture. Likewise, the \\"Jewish\\" Israeli culture would continue with this process, but will add the Palestinians' history, culture and religious diversity, and integrate them as aspects of the Hebrew national consciousness. In order to do so, he believes that the whole concept of Jewishness as the defining factor in Zionism must be re-framed in terms of ethnicity, as opposed to simply religious.Arab Jews ‚Äì Israel National News blog, Tamar Yonah, 29 June 2009 Misinai concedes that \\"The Engagement\\" might seem like a surreal project, but so too did Zionism initially. \\"The Engagement\\", he admits, is a process that requires participation by both sides and mutual acknowledgement of the \\"other\\" as a part of oneself. Uni-lateral Engagement As a prelude to creating conditions to make the re-integration of the majority of Palestinians with the Jews possible, Misinai advocates a \\"Uni-lateral Engagement\\" in which autonomy is granted for the Palestinian territories and the present Palestinian leaderships are removed. He states that Israeli operations in Palestinian areas must be designed not only to ensure the safety of Israeli citizens, but also to liberate the Palestinians from the yoke of the Palestinian leaderships whom he accuses of subjugating them and making their lives wretched, feeding them lies, and leading them from one Nakba catastrophe to another, causing untold damage to the entire region and igniting terrorism around the globe. Their entire terror apparatus must be dismantled, and they must be replaced by a new Palestinian leadership devoted to peace. Should any peace-loving Palestinian leadership fail to appear, Israel must enforce its own authority upon all factions in the Palestinian population.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 354 Re-engagement process Misinai states that the re-engagement will take one of two forms: Residents without citizenship, or Re-engagement with the People of Israel. The process will be carried out on a family-by-family basis, and in certain instances on an individual basis. In the first stage, which will be carried out gradually among all the Palestinian population, each and every Palestinian (except those suspected of terrorist activity) will have three choices: * Loyal Residency: An oath of allegiance to the State, and declaration of waiver of citizenship rights for oneself (if the individual declines to opt for the second course of action that follows). This is equivalent to the American green card, but where additionally, one's status is passed to children on the basis of jus sanguinis (by contrast, children of American non-citizens born on US soil are automatically citizens due to jus soli, whatever the status of the parents). Children of individuals (who are Descendant of Israel) who chose this first option may circumvent status of \\"loyal residency\\" passed on by their parents if they themselves opt for the second course of action that follows. This choice is available only for those Palestinians who do not wish to rejoin the People of Israel, or who are not Descendants of Israel. * Re-engagement with the People of Israel: The expressed desire and willingness to rejoin the People of Israel via an oath of allegiance to the State of Israel and its people, the People of Israel, and declaration that one does not belong to the Arab nation. * Emigration: Emigration and purchase of the √©migr√©s‚Äô house by the State at a fair price (in order not to cause injury to √©migr√©s due to fluctuations in market prices, likely to be depressed by an exodus and surplus of real estate). This choice is available for those Palestinians who, if eligible for the first, or both the first and second options, want neither.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 356‚Äì358 In the event of either of the first two options, neither de-Christianization nor de-Islamization, nor cultural de-Arabization are components of The Engagement. Furthermore, if an individual person wanted to revert to Judaism, this is strictly a personal matter which would be done through the relevant religious channels, which The Engagement process is not a part of in any form. The Engagement is of a national re-unificationist nature. Most importantly, it is thus far the first that is specifically religiously pluralistic (that is, it acknowledges the People of Israel are today of many faiths), an aspect that lends to its very controversy. Citizenship sought by members of world Jewry would continue to be dealt with by the requirements and specifications of the Law of Return. Persons who are neither Jews nor Palestinians, and are seeking residency or citizenship, would follow naturalisation processes and requirements separate from both the Law of Return and The Engagement. =Requirements= Under the scheme while each new member would not be required to convert to Judaism, they would, however, be required to gain mastery of the following: * The Hebrew language (including reading and writing). * The culture of the People of Israel. * The history of the People of Israel, including the forced conversion of their ancestors. * The history of Eretz-Israel. * The Tanakh. * Jewish religious tradition.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, pp. 330‚Äì333 The scope of knowledge or proficiencies required would be equal to that of most secular Jews, and would ensure that the act of re-engagement would have sufficient quality and depth. The scope of knowledge would actually be far greater than that required in conventional conversion to Judaism, and would not exclusively focus on matters of faith and ritual. This is in order to provide a cognitive counterweight to the hostile education and incitement that Palestinians have been subjected to in the past in regard to Israel. Moreover, it will serve to enhance the level of education of participants to enable them to successfully integrate into Israeli society without being marginalised or becoming second-class citizens. Such education, outlined in Option Two above, will continue for a number of years and will be accomplished in a framework similar to the Hebrew language ulpans (intense six month ‚Äòtotal immersion‚Äô crash-courses designed to inculcate basic mastery of Hebrew by new immigrants in Israel). The children of such Palestinians will be enrolled in the Israeli school system, compulsory education just as their Israeli counterparts. The other requirements of enrollees in the scheme are as follows: * Declare their renunciation of their association to the Arab Nation. This, Misinai asserts, does not mean dis-association from Arab culture. * Take a short bath in a Mikveh to remove influence of potential intermarriage with people other than the people of Israel during the generations. This, Misinai states, has a purely national meaning and does not impose any religious undertaking on the person taking it. * Take an oath of allegiance to the People of Israel and the State of Israel. * Palestinians who complete the process of re-joining the People of Israel and are not yet Israeli citizens will receive Israeli citizenship. All re-joining Palestinians will be registered with either an Israeli or a Jewish nationality according to their choice. =Benefits= Those who choose the first path (loyal residency only) will have the option to choose an Arab Islamic (or Christian) education school track, with an abridged Israeli curriculum. The children of those who choose the second path (re-engagement) will be required to enroll in the regular Israeli school system. Only those who complete Israeli education and belong to the second option (the re-engagement path) can progress to the third step ‚Äì service in the IDF, taking an oath of allegiance to the Jewish People. At the beginning, the IDF will establish special units for this population (similar to separate minority units of Bedouin, Druze and Circassians in the formative years of the IDF). Palestinians who are above draft age will undergo abridged military service (current policy for older new Jewish immigrants), then be integrated into the IDF reserve system. Only Palestinians who will serve in the IDF will be eligible for Israeli citizenship (except for those with serious health issues or those who are too old, who receive exemptions). Only the army will have the prerogative to decide which candidates for military service should do civil service in place of military service. Citizenship will carry eligibility for certain civil rights including the right to vote for the Knesset and benefits such as receipt of better social benefits for veterans including higher children's allowances. A citizen who betrays the state will lose his citizenship and be harshly punished. Similarly, a loyal resident who will abridge his oath of allegiance will lose his or her Residency rights and be deported, in particularly serious cases, after offenders complete their sentence. =Exceptions= Only those considered to be Descendants of Israel would benefit from the scheme. Tsvi Misinai states that only a small minority of the Palestinian who are presently outside of the Land of Israel (i.e., the refugees or diaspora) have significant rights over Western Eretz-Yisrael. That right belongs to the original Descendants of the People of Israel (i.e., the Jews, a majority of Palestinians presently in the Land of Israel, and a minority of Palestinians presently outside the Land of Israel), and to the Descendants of the Roman Army (whose historic rights in Eretz-Israel are, however, much lesser than those of the Descendants of Israel). The majority of the Descendants of the Roman Army are presently in Jordan, and despite their long-standing seniority rights in Israel, they must remain there, as most emigrated to Jordan of their own free will after the Six day war of 1967. The only exception to this is specific cases of family reunion.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 365 On the other hand, Brethren of Israel, being native to the land east of the Jordan river, only those who are presently in the Land of Israel will be eligible for \\"loyal residency\\", unless they opt for emigration. Those Brethren of Israel who are presently outside of the Land of Israel (a majority among Palestinian refugees) will not be eligible for \\"loyal residency\\", nor a right of return to the Land of Israel. They possess a right of return to Jordan. This is because they are not ethnically Jews, and their historic Jewish identity came about by forced conversions to Judaism, as is the case with Islam. Furthermore, their rights to Israel go back only 170 years, and are superseded by those of the Jews and Descendants of Israel, who have a historic connection to the land, spanning several thousand years.Brother shall not lift his sword against Brother, Tsvi Misinai, Liad publishing, 2007, p. 246 Reactions Support Holding copies of The Engagement Movement booklet (from left onwards), Misinai, Mordechai Nisan, Asher Shlein, and Mounir Al-Krenawi, Kadima Party politician and the first Bedouin member of the Engagement Movement Tsvi Misinai's theory does have its supporters among some Palestinians, including Sulaiman al-Hamri, a Fatah official from Bethlehem, A tragic misunderstanding ‚Äì Times online, 13 January 2009 and former Palestinian Authority minister Ziad Abuzayyad, who asked Misinai to prepare Arabic language versions of his thesis and the Engagement booklet.'This is a conflict between brothers; it's all a big misunderstanding' ‚Äì 20 August 2009, Jerusalem Post He has also gained support among some Jews, including at least one Israeli government minister who so far has remained unidentified. Among Bedouins, a key vocal supporter of Misinai's theory has been Sheikh Salem al- Huzeil, the head of the \\"Our State\\" Movement and a prominent leader of the Al- Huzeil tribe from Rahat. In October 2009, with the aim of furthering Jewish and Bedouin ties, Al-Huzeil organised a meeting with Misinai and the religious- Zionist ‚ÄúHit‚Äôhabrut‚Äù (Joining Together) Movement, in which he maintained that most of his tribal ancestors were Jewish prior to their forced conversion during the Muslim conquest approximately 1,300 years ago.Sanhedrin Sponsors Unique Bedouin-Jewish Get-Together ‚Äì 13 October 2009, Israel National News The Sheikh's act, however, was not without any repercussions. In the immediate month following the meeting, the Sheikh was the recipient of numerous death threats from Bedouins enraged at his efforts to maintain friendly relations with the Jewish community and to demonstrate for the release of kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit. Posters were distributed calling for the death of Sheikh al-Huzeil. Moreover, several members of his family suffered severe burns after rival Bedouins set his house on fire in Rahat.Death Threats against Bedouin with Jewish Ancestry ‚Äì 2 November 2009, Israel National News Additionally, some Haredi Jewish settler leaders have also welcomed the idea with great enthusiasm, since they believe that once the entire biblical land of Israel is populated with Jews, a new era of peace on Earth will be ushered in. Rabbi Dov Stein, secretary and one of the seven- member leadership councilCurrent members of the Sanhedrin ‚Äì thesanhedrin.org, 5 October 2009 of the current nascent Sanhedrin (a Jewish religious council of 200 rabbis modelled on the biblical Sanhedrin rulers of Jerusalem), also supports the Hebrew origin of most Palestinians. Misinai (far right) at a meeting with elders from the Bedouin Al-Huzeil tribe which claims Jewish descent and Sanhedrin members, which took place in Rahat on 13 October 2009 Stein, however, as an Orthodox Jew, differs with Misinai on its implications, since he sees Jewish nationhood as primarily defined by religious affiliation to Judaism, even where one may not necessarily be of Hebrew ancestral origin, and not defined by Hebrew ancestral origin. Stein asserts that it's because the Jews uphold the Torah that they have the right to Israel. Therefore, in order to be accepted, Stein argues that the Palestinians must give up Islam and embrace Judaism as a prerequisite for re-joining the Jewish people.'Jews they are definitely not' ‚Äì 20 August 2009, Jerusalem Post Among Israeli academics and intellectuals, Tsvi Misinai has received the avid support of Mordechai Nisan, a professor and scholar of Middle East Studies from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Nisan was also asked by the Sanhedrin to serve as its professional consultant on this issue, while Elon Yarden, an attorney who has written a series of books about the land of Israel and its inhabitants, has also reached the same conclusion as Misinai.According to the law of Moses and Ishmael ‚Äì Avinadav Vidkon, Benni Mekimi Among the Druze, Druze MK Ayoob Kara of the Likud party agrees with Misinai's claim about the Druze, and further postulates that all Druze rather than just a few villages, are actually descended from Jews who were forced to convert to Islam. Kara has even gone as far as saying that he can bring forward genetic evidence to prove it. Criticism Misinai's thesis and work has also garnered controversy, both at home and abroad, among some Palestinians and Jews alike, with the criticisms mostly coming from the Palestinian side. One Palestinian intellectual, Ismail Al-Shindi, professor of Islamic Jurisprudence at Al-Quds Open University denied that Jews ever maintained a sizeable population in the land of Palestine, or that they were forcibly converted by the Ottomans, and he even went as far as to accuse Misinai of \\"falsifying\\" history to Hebraize Palestinians.Falsifying History to Hebraize Palestinians ‚Äì Islamonline.com, 16 July 2009 Another Palestinian, Kamel Katalo, professor of Sociology at Al- Khalil University in Hebron, has stated that he has read Tsvi Misinai's booklet and come to the conclusion that Misinai makes strident generalisations and reaches spurious and completely erroneous conclusions based on questionable premises, stating that there is no such thing as a \\"Jewish gene\\". His most notable Arab Israeli critic is the former Balad MK, Azmi Bishara, who dismissed his thesis as yet another Jewish plot to remove the Palestinians from their land. Misinai has accused both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities of being indifferent to his findings.4 Palestinians claim descent from Jews forced to convert ‚Äì 29 October 2008, Haaretz Literature Tsvi Misinai has written two books on this subject, Hearing is Believing ‚Äì The Roots and the Solution to the Eretz-Israel Problem explaining his thesis and detailing numerous testimonies, linguistic and name similarities, genetic and natural science findings, cultural and religious similarities, as well as a shortened version Brother Shall not Lift Sword against Brother.

Roop is also Director of Programming for The Dock's parent company, Larche Communications, which has three other broadcasting licenses. Childhood and early life Roop began working as a child actor at the age of eight, appearing in more than 30 television and radio commercials, including Pizza Hut, Wrangler Jeans, and McCain French Fries. He also voiced several radio commercials for companies such as Esso and Big Brothers, and worked on several movies, including The Last Season, Night Friend and an episode of the television series Friday The 13th. Roop's family moved from the west end of Toronto to the Waterdown area when he was beginning high school. He spent his formative years at Waterdown District High School. It was through a high school co-operative education program that he developed his interest in radio, completing a placement at the Mohawk College Radio Station CIOI-FM in his fourth year of high school. Radio career After graduating High School, Roop began a two-year radio broadcasting program at Fanshawe College in the fall of 1996. He graduated from the program in the spring of 1998 and started working for BEA-VER Communications, on CKSY FM95 CKSY-FM on March 2, 1998. He started as the Swing Announcer at CKSY-FM. At the time, BEA-VER Communications owned and operated CKSY-FM and CFCO, its AM Oldies sister station, from their Chatham, Kent studios, but had an application in progress to the CRTC for a third FM station. When this application was successful, the company opened CKUE-FM in November 1999, with Roop as the Afternoon Drive host, and moving to the morning show in January 2001. In June 2002, Roop was hired to work as the Afternoon Drive host in Midland, Ontario on CICZ-FM. At the time, CICZ-FM was a country music station, KICX 104 FM. In 2004 Larche Communications opened CIKZ-FM in Kitchener‚ÄîWaterloo. At that time, the KICX 104 FM Program Director was moved to CIKZ-FM to launch the station, at which point Roop was moved to the Morning Show and given the program director title. Roop remained Morning Show host/Program Director on KICX 104 FM until March 2008. During his time in that position, he was named the Canadian Country Music Association's Music Director Of The Year in 2007, and won the Canadian Country Music Association's Personality Of The Year Award in 2006 and 2007 with his co-host Carey Moran. In March 2008, Larche Communications moved its country format to its newly acquired Orillia frequency at CICX-FM, and launched a brand new Classic Rock station on CICZ-FM, now known as 104.1 THE DOCK. Roop said goodbye to his longtime co-host Carey Moran, and moved to Classic Rock, remaining on the 104.1 frequency to launch a new morning show with Meg Whitton and Brian Wicks, both of whom had moved to Midland and decided to stay with Larche Communications after the sale of CIKZ. Shortly after the launch of the Dock, Roop was named Director of Programming for Larche Communications. He now oversees the programming, with the help of his KICX PD's Jack Latimer and Trinette Atkinson, DOCK Midland APD Josh Duncan, on CICZ-FM, CICX-FM, CICS-FM and Don Vail at CJOS-FM in Owen Sound. Canadian Country Spotlight Roop also hosts a weekly, one-hour country music spotlight program called Canadian Country Spotlight, which highlights Canadian country music. It airs weekly on country music radio stations across Canada. The show launched on Labour Day Weekend 2011, and has since featured Jason McCoy, George Canyon, Gord Bamford, Paul Brandt and various other well-known figures from Canadian Country.

The Center for Politics is part of the University of Virginia and draws its funding from a variety of public and private sources. It has its own dedicated staff and building, operating out of historic Montesano, on property once owned by U.S. Senator Thomas S. Martin. The Center for Politics's main focus is civic education and engagement, exemplified by its flagship program, the Youth Leadership Initiative. The Youth Leadership Initiative provides a free technology-based curriculum of civics materials to K-12 schools across the country and around the world, and conducts the largest all-student mock election in the nation each November. The Center for Politics also publishes Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball, a source of comprehensive election analysis which has been recognized as providing the most accurate electoral predictions in the country on its website and through a free weekly e-mail. Additionally, the Center for Politics organizes conferences and programs, publishes books and reports, and supports and promotes college student civic education through internships, voter registration drives, and on-campus speakers.  Mission  The Center for Politics was founded to \\"promote the value of politics and the importance of civic engagement.\\" By improving the political process and citizens' interaction with it, the Center for Politics strives to improve the functioning of government itself. In addition, the mission includes three goals: * Encourage citizens to actively participate in the political process and government * Evaluate and promote the best practices in civic education for students of all ages * Educate citizens through the Center for Politics' comprehensive research, programs, and publications  History  The Center for Politics was founded in 1998 by Robert Kent Gooch Professor of Politics and noted political analyst Larry Sabato, who is known as \\"the most quoted professor in all the land.\\" Its first programs that year were the Virginia Governors' Conference, which evolved into the Virginia Political History Project, and a post-election conference which is now the annual American Democracy Conference. The Youth Leadership Initiative (which provides civic education resources and tools for grades K-12) launched in 1999, as did the National Symposium Series, and the Crystal Ball's election predictions debuted in 2002. In 2008, the Center for Politics moved into its new home at Montesano, an early 20th-century Georgian Revival house on land previously owned by Thomas Staples Martin, US Senator from Virginia. In 2009, the Center for Politics launched its newest program, Global Perspectives on Democracy, a program designed to foster dialogue between citizens in established and emerging democracies around the world, and conduct workshops on civic action plans.  Youth Leadership Initiative  The Youth Leadership Initiative provides free, technology-based civic education materials to K-12 teachers and students in public and private schools in all 50 states and Defense Department schools internationally. The program emphasizes hands-on participation so that students can directly experience the electoral and legislative procedures of American government. The components of the Youth Leadership Initiative include detailed lesson plans, an online mock election, an online policy-making simulation which engages students in the law-making process nationwide, and a political campaign-simulating computer game. In 2008, Diane Trim of Inside the School, a website for secondary educators, ranked the Youth Leadership Initiative's mock election highly, giving it more stars than the other two educational mock election programs reviewed and praising the Youth Leadership Initiative program for its comprehensiveness and ease of use.Inside the School Mock Election Reviews The Youth Leadership Initiative began as a response to a perception of increasing political apathy among citizens and a decline in the number of schools incorporating civics lessons into their curricula. It started in Virginia public schools, but is now nationwide.

With more than 20 staff and six offices, its mission is to conserve and restore the world's largest freshwater resource using policy, education and local efforts, ensuring a healthy Great Lakes and clean water for generations of people and wildlife. Throughout its history, the integration of public engagement and sound policy have been the cornerstone to its approach to Great Lakes restoration and protection. Establishment The proliferation of nuclear power plants around Lake Michigan and threats to Indiana' dunes led activists from the four-state region to convene at a conference on April 12, 1969, organized by Hyde Park Herald editor and Openlands Project staffer Lee Botts. The conferees' top recommendation was for the formation of an organization, with professional staff, to coordinate research and public awareness about threats and policy solutions for the rehabilitation of the largest lake wholly within U.S. borders. The conference organizers announced a year later, at a second conference held May 2, 1970, the formation of an organization, with the formal establishment of a \\"Lake Michigan Federation\\" announced in September. With support from the Chicago Community Trust, Weiboldt Foundation, and others, the group took on a board of directors from Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin, and professional staff, with Botts serving as first executive director.http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/specialcoll/services/rjd/findingaids/LakeMichFedf.html It immediately provided capacity for citizens to monitor pollution discharge permits, and worked to challenge the siting of new and expansion of existing shoreline power plants. With leadership from Botts, in 1971, it successfully lobbied Mayor Richard J. Daley for Chicago to become the first Great Lakes city to ban phosphates in detergents. Seeing the effects of such phosphates led to the need for joint U.S.-Canadian efforts to reduce nutrients causing excessive algae growth. These ecological conditions created an opening for the Federation to help press for the first binational Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and U.S. Clean Water Act, both in 1972. Botts left in 1975, in part due to a disagreement with the Board about the organization's mission. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to head the Great Lakes Basin Commission until 1980, when it was disbanded by the Reagan Administration. Over the years, Botts would return twice, however, as acting executive director in an effort to provide continuity to the organization. Leadership The intervening years saw some contraction, until the appointment of Glenda Daniel as executive director in 1986. During her tenure, the Lake Michigan Federation opened offices in Muskegon, Milwaukee and Green Bay, with its original headquarters remaining in Chicago. With the U.S. and Canada signing a major amendment to the U.S.-Canada Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1987, which among other things allowed for the designation of toxic hotspot \\"Areas of Concern,\\" the Federation made a significant push to empower local communities in these \\"AOCs\\" to seek support for the implementation of cleanups. After Daniel's resignation in 1992, again, the organization contracted, nearly shuttering. In 1998, the Board of Directors appointed Cameron Davis to serve as its executive director. Having started as a volunteer under Botts' guidance in 1986 and rising to serve as deputy director before leaving to pursue a career in environmental litigation, Davis returned with an aggressive focus on advocacy and expanding partnerships in various states, including bipartisan outreach to federal, state and municipal elected officials. In 2003, the Alliance formed the Adopt-a-Beach‚Ñ¢ program, a platform for volunteers to monitor and restore coastlines around the Great Lakes. In 2005, with a unanimous vote of the Board of Directors, the organization changed its name to the \\"Alliance for the Great Lakes\\" and appointed Davis as its first President & CEO. In 2008, the Alliance received the American Bar Association's Distinguished Achievement Award in Environmental Law and Policy, the first not-for-profit citizen's group to win the award. In 2009, the newly elected President Barack Obama, who had once represented South Chicago's lakefront district as a state senator, appointed Davis to coordinate federal inter-departmental Great Lakes restoration work.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/04/obama-taps-cameron- davis_n_211315.html In December 2009, the Board selected Joel Brammeier, the Alliance's Vice President for Policy, as President & CEO.http://www.greatlakes.org/Page.aspx?pid=1004 In 2011, the Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition named Brammeier a co-chair of the 120-plus organization consortium,http://healthylakes.org/about/coalition-staff/ which among other efforts, campaigned for the establishment of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/energy- environment/white-house-proposes-updated-great-lakes- plan/2014/05/30/30930466-e840-11e3-a70e-ea1863229397_story.html Brammeier has been a leading advocate for re-separating the Chicago Area Waterway System to protect the Great Lakes from invasive species such as Asian carp.http://www.greatlakes.org/Document.Doc?id=779 Accomplishments The Alliance's reach has extended to Washington, D.C., where in 1974, based on PCBs' devastating impact in the Great Lakes, the organization led efforts for Congress to ban the chemical through the Toxic Substances Control Act. In 1989, it initiated a lawsuit to prevent the illegal sale of Lake Michigan lake bottom by the Illinois legislature to a prominent Chicago university, despite disagreement about the move from other environmental organizations. Decades later, the case \\"Lake Michigan Federation v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\\" is a seminal decision under the Public Trust Doctrine,http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-23/news/9002200903_1_loyola- lake-bottom-ruling which prohibits the sale of public Great Lakes resources to private entities.http://elr.info/sites/default/files/litigation/21.20111.htm In 2002 and again in 2008, the Alliance helped write and partner with business interests to pass the Great Lakes Legacy Act to fund Area of Concern cleanups.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg42581/html/CHRG-110hhrg42581.htm It helped write and pass the Great Lakes Basin Water Resources Compact to set water conservation standards.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110shrg44332/html/CHRG-110shrg44332.htm The Compact was signed into law in 2008.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2008/08/02/AR2008080201389.html And, with its traditional emphasis on encouraging citizens to get involved, the Alliance continued to build its Adopt-a-Beach‚Ñ¢ program. In recent years the program has surpassed 10,000 volunteers annually and marked a new commitment to data-driven conservation,http://greatlakes.org/volunteer with volunteers using their own data to implement smoking bans at public beaches and inform decisions on \\"microplastics\\" from cosmetics that have the potential to harm ecosystem health.http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/12/new-concerns-about- plastic-pollution-in-great-lakes-garbage-patch/ References Category:Great Lakes Category:Great Lakes region (U.S.) Category:Nature conservation organizations based in the United States Category:Water organizations in the United States Category:Environmental organizations based in Chicago Category:Environmental organizations established in 1970 ","title":"Alliance for the Great Lakes"},{"id":"24434413","text":"Sergei Vyacheslavovich Dymov (; born 11 July 1975) is a former Russian professional football player.

A vigorous monetary economy was based on a widely-circulated currency (the dinar) and the integration of monetary areas that were previously independent. Business techniques and forms of business organisation employed during this time included contracts, bills of exchange, long-distance international trade, forms of partnership (mufawadha) such as limited partnerships (mudharaba), and forms of credit, debt, profit, loss, capital (al-mal), capital accumulation (nama al-mal), circulating capital, capital expenditure, revenue, cheques, promissory notes,Robert Sabatino Lopez, Irving Woodworth Raymond, Olivia Remie Constable (2001), Medieval Trade in the Mediterranean World: Illustrative Documents, Columbia University Press, . trusts (see Waqf), savings accounts, transactional accounts, pawning, loaning, exchange rates, bankers, money changers, ledgers, deposits, assignments, the double-entry bookkeeping system,Subhi Y. Labib (1969), \\"Capitalism in Medieval Islam\\", The Journal of Economic History 29 (1), pp. 79‚Äì96 [92‚Äì3]. and lawsuits.Ray Spier (2002), \\"The history of the peer-review process\\", Trends in Biotechnology 20 (8), p. 357-358 [357]. Organizational enterprises independent from the state also existed in the medieval Islamic world, while the agency institution was also introduced.Said Amir Arjomand (1999), \\"The Law, Agency, and Policy in Medieval Islamic Society: Development of the Institutions of Learning from the Tenth to the Fifteenth Century\\", Comparative Studies in Society and History 41, pp. 263‚Äì93. Cambridge University Press.Samir Amin (1978), \\"The Arab Nation: Some Conclusions and Problems\\", MERIP Reports 68, pp. 3‚Äì14 [8, 13]. Many of these early capitalist concepts were adopted and further advanced in medieval Europe from the 13th century onwards.Jairus Banaji (2007), \\"Islam, the Mediterranean and the rise of capitalism\\", Historical Materialism 15 (1), pp. 47‚Äì74, Brill Publishers. Some have argued that these economic activities laid the foundations for the development of modern capitalism. Market economy A market economy was established in the Islamic world on the basis of an economic system resembling merchant capitalism. Capital formation was promoted by labour in medieval Islamic society, and financial capital was developed by a considerable number of owners of monetary funds and precious metals. Riba (usury) was prohibited by the Qur'an, but this did not hamper the development of capital in any way. The capitalists (sahib al-mal) were at the height of their power between the 9th‚Äì12th centuries, but their influence declined after the arrival of the ikta (landowners) and after production was monopolized by the state, both of which hampered the development of industrial capitalism in the Islamic world.Maya Shatzmiller, pp. 402‚Äì3. Some state enterprises still had a capitalist mode of production, such as pearl diving in Iraq and the textile industry in Egypt.Judith Tucker (1975), \\"Islam and Capitalism by Maxime Rodinson\\", MERIP Reports 34, pp. 31‚Äì2 [31]. During the 11th‚Äì13th centuries, the \\"Karimis\\", an early enterprise and business group controlled by entrepreneurs, came to dominate much of the Islamic world's economy.Subhi Y. Labib (1969), \\"Capitalism in Medieval Islam\\", The Journal of Economic History 29 (1), pp. 79‚Äì96 [81‚Äì2]. The group was controlled by about fifty Muslim merchants labelled as \\"Karimis\\" who were of Yemeni, Egyptian and sometimes Indian origins.The Cambridge economic history of Europe, pp. 438‚Äì40. Cambridge University Press, . Each Karimi merchant had considerable wealth, ranging from at least 100,000 dinars to as much as 10 million dinars. The group had considerable influence in most important eastern markets and sometimes in politics through its financing activities and through a variety of customers, including Emirs, Sultans, Viziers, foreign merchants, and common consumers. The Karimis dominated many of the trade routes across the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean, and as far as Francia in the north, China in the east, and sub-Saharan Africa in the south, where they obtained gold from gold mines. Strategies employed by the Karimis include the use of agents, the financing of projects as a method of acquiring capital, and a banking institution for loans and deposits. Another important difference between the Karimis and other entrepreneurs before and during their time was that they were not tax collectors or landlords, but their capitalism was due entirely to trade and financial transactions.Subhi Y. Labib (1969), \\"Capitalism in Medieval Islam\\", The Journal of Economic History 29 (1), pp. 79‚Äì96 [81‚Äì4]. Though medieval Islamic economics appears to have somewhat resembled a form of capitalism, some Orientalists also believe that there exist a number of parallels between Islamic economics and communism, including the Islamic ideas of zakat and riba. Others see Islamic economics as neither completely capitalistic nor completely socialistic, but rather a balance between the two, emphasizing both \\"individual economic freedom and the need to serve the common good.\\" (see online ) Others point out that Islam has an inherently capitalist nature and argue this most through respect for private property as the foundation of capitalism in Islam, as well as the historical fact that the Prophet Muhammad was an entrepreneur, a merchant.

They have toured in Europe on several times, and they have played with acts such as; Bell Orchestre, Deerhunter, Arab Strap and Mono. Aerial was signed to Nomethod Records in 2006, and has since been released outside of Sweden by labels; Tangled Up!, Thomason Sounds and will be released in late 2009 by Flake Records. The lead singer and guitarist, Sebastian Arnstr√∂m, is also a member of the semi-electronic indie act Simian Ghost.

They all attended high school together, where they studied art, music and cinema. The band grew out of their common interest for mentioned expressions, and they have always been taking great pride in having total control over every aspect of their works. They recorded a self-released demo called You are which got the attention of Swedish indie label Nomethod Records. They recorded their debut album in a similar fashion and it was released in late 2006. Since then they have recorded two more full-length albums and one EP called The legion of dynamic dischord, a not so subtle reference to the American writer Robert Anton Wilson. Other writers mentioned in their work is Allen Ginsberg, H.P. Lovecraft, Arthur C. Clarke and Philip K. Dick. When they released The sentinel in 2007, bass player Joakim Westlund went to Peru and was substituted live by Niklas Wennerstrand, which upon Joakims return decided to stay as a regular member of the band.  Influences  As stated in interviews the band is widely influenced by acts such as Glenn Branca, Sonic Youth, Pavement, Yo la tengo, The Books, Rachel's, Animal Collective, Gastr del sol, The flaming lips and Black Dice. They also had a brief but notable period exploring the genre of post-rock, and was in doing so influenced by bands such as Mono, Mogwai and Explosions in the sky. The band has also said that it has no small debt to the works of kraut rock legends Kraftwerk and Neu!.

In 1844 Caversfield became part of Oxfordshire, but until then it was always an exclave of Buckinghamshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,788. Early history The ancient Roman road between Alchester and Towcester, now the A4421, forms the eastern boundary of the parish. Caversfield's toponym has evolved from Cavrefelle in the 11th century through Kaueresfuld, Chauresfeld, Caffresfeld, Caueresfeud and Kaveresfeld (12th‚Äì13th centuries), and by the 18th century it was Catesfield. Before the Norman Conquest of England the manor was held by one Edward, who was a man of Tostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumbria. The Domesday Book records that in 1086 Caversfield was one of the manors owned by William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. William's descendants retained Caversfield until the beginning of the 14th century. By 1317 Caversfield was held by Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and when the Earl died in 1324 it passed to his niece Joan. She was the wife of David II Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl, who although Scottish had become a peer of England after King Robert the Bruce deposed and exiled him for rebellion. Caversfield remained with the Earl of Atholl's descendants until 1375, when it passed to the heirs of a different branch of the de Warenne family. By the 12th century the Gargate family held the feudal tenancy of Caversfield. In 1236 Muriel de Ros and Isabel de Munbury, the daughters of Hugh Gargate, endowed the tenancy of half of the manor to the Augustinian Priory at Bicester. The priory retained this holding until the Dissolution of the Monasteries after 1536. In the 13th century the Gargate family owned a watermill, a windmill and a house where the manorial court was held. The watermill was presumably on the small River Bure which rises at Bainton, flows south through Caversfield and Bicester and around Graven Hill, and joins the River Ray at Merton. No trace of either mill is known to survive, and the original manor house has gone. Parish church Saxon window in the south side of St Laurence's church tower The oldest part of the small Church of England parish church of Saint Laurence is the Saxon ground stage of the bell tower, probably from the 10th century. The nave and chancel were rebuilt late in the 12th century. Early in the 13th century the chancel was remodelled again in the Early English Gothic style with two lancet windows at its east end, and the bell-stage of the tower was either added or rebuilt. The small north and south aisles were added around the same time. Each aisle is linked to the nave by an arcade of two bays, in which the style of the piers is of about AD 1180 but the Early English Gothic style of the arches is of about 1230. The south walls of the church include a lancet window, a Decorated Gothic window from early in the 14th century and a Perpendicular Gothic window from late in the 15th century. In the 18th century the north and south aisles of St Laurence church were demolished and the two arcades blocked up. In 1874 the Gothic Revival architect Henry Woodyer restored the chancel, rebuilt the aisles and added a vestry to the east of the north aisle. St Laurence's parish is now part of the benefice of Bicester with Caversfield. Church bells Until the 20th century the tower had three bells, including a treble bell that was cast in about 1218 for Hugh and Sibilla Gargate and is believed to be the oldest inscribed bell in England. In the 20th century this bell was removed from the tower and mounted as an historic exhibit inside the church. The tower now has a ring of five bells. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast the tenor bell in 1874 and the fourth bell in 1876. Mears & Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the third bell in 1928 and added new treble and second bells in 1949. CWGC graves in St Laurence's parish churchyard Commonwealth War Graves St Lawrence's parish churchyard includes 25 Commonwealth War Graves connected with RAF Bicester, dating from before and during the Second World War. This was a training station for Bomber Command and a number of the burials are of airmen killed in training accidents. 19 are RAF airmen, including one Australian and one Canadian serving in the RAF. Four are RCAF airmen, one is from the RNZAF and one is a soldier from the Royal Artillery. Economic and social history An open field system of farming prevailed in the parish until 1780, when an inclosure act enabled the enclosure of the common land of the parish. Caversfield is on the old main road between Bicester and Banbury via Aynho. In 1791 an Act of Parliament made both the Bicester‚ÄìAynho road and the Bicester‚ÄìFinmere stretch of the old Roman road into turnpikes. The two roads ceased to be turnpikes in 1877. In the 1920s the Bicester‚ÄìBanbury road was classified as part of the A41 and the Bicester‚ÄìFinmere road was part of the A421. After the M40 motorway was completed in 1990, the Bicester‚ÄìBanbury road was downgraded to B4100 and the Bicester‚ÄìFinmere road was reclassified A4421. In the 19th century Caversfield's status as an exclave of Buckinghamshire was brought to an end. The Reform Act 1832 removed the parish from the Buckingham parliamentary constituency, and in 1839 two further Acts placed exclaves such as Caversfield under their surrounding counties' magistrates and county constabularies. Finally the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 transferred Caversfield to Oxfordshire for all remaining purposes. The architect C.R. Cockerell designed Caversfield House, which was built in 1842‚Äì45 on the site of the former manor house. The architect William Wilkinson designed the neo-Tudor style Brashfield House, which was built in 1872‚Äì75 in the east of the parish by the Roman Road. Until the 20th century Caversfield was a manor and parish with no village and a very small population. However, in 1911 Bicester Airfield was created just east of the Roman road in Launton parish. At the end of the First World War the airfield became RAF Bicester and subsequently housing for RAF personnel was built in Skimmingdish Lane in the eastern part of Caversfield parish. RAF operations ceased in 2004, and the Skimmingdish Lane accommodation is now used by the Defence Logistics Organisation. The parish also now includes accommodation for USAFE personnel serving at the RAF Croughton communications base in Northamptonshire about north of Caversfield. Late in the 20th century Bicester has been greatly expanded with new housing. Parts of the Bure Park housing estate, although contiguous with Bicester, are in Caversfield civil parish.

After five years of lying over their radio, there was no reason anyone should take what they say credibly. It was clear to them that they needed an independent, credible witness to show what was happening.\\"Keiger, 1997. Nightline controversy According to Thayer, Ted Koppel of ABC News made a verbal agreement with Thayer to use footage from the trial on Nightline, then violated that agreement: :\\"[Koppel] returned home with a copy of my videotape. I gave it to him in exchange for his strict promise that its only use would be on Nightline. However, once he had the copy of the tape, ABC News released video, still pictures, and even transcripts of my interviews to news organizations throughout the world.

Despite the fact that ABC provided prominent and repeated credit and generous remuneration for his work, Mr. Thayer initiated a five- year barrage of complaints coupled with repeated demands for more money.\\"Jeffrey Schneider, VP, ABC News, quoted in Richard Linnett and Wayne Friedman, \\"Marketing the news: the selling of Pol Pot.\\" Advertising Age, November 18, 2002, Vol. 73, Issue 46; Section: Briefs. In 2002 Thayer sued Koppel and ABC News for $30 million in punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages. Interview with Pol Pot In October 1997, Thayer returned to Anlong Veng and became only the second western journalist (after Elizabeth Becker in 1978Becker E.

Thayer recounted the story of his interview with Pol Pot in his unpublished\\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" book Sympathy for the Devil: Living Dangerously in Cambodia ‚Äì A Foreign Correspondent's Story.Nate Thayer, Sympathy for the Devil: Living Dangerously in Cambodia ‚Äì A Foreign Correspondent's Story. Penguin Putnam Inc., New York 1999, Pol Pot told Thayer: :\\"First, I want to let you know that I came to join the revolution, not to kill the Cambodian people. Look at me now. Do you think ... am I a violent person? No. So, as far as my conscience and my mission were concerned, there was no problem. This needs to be clarified...My experience was the same as that of my movement. We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as I told you. I admit it now and I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes.\\"Nate Thayer, \\"Day of Reckoning.\\" Far Eastern Economic Review, October 30, 1997: pp. 14‚Äì20. Thayer and the death of Pol Pot Thayer visited Anlong Veng again on April 16, 1998, only a day after Pol Pot had died. After photographing the corpse he briefly interviewed Ta Mok and Pol Pot's second wife Muon, who told Thayer, \\"What I would like the world to know is that he was a good man, a patriot, a good father.\\"Thayer, \\"Dying Breath,\\" April 30, 1998. Thayer was then asked to transport Pol Pot's body in his pickup truck to the site a short distance away where it was later cremated. Thayer claims that Pol Pot committed suicide by drinking poison because of his belief that the Khmer Rouge were planning to \\"hand him over to the Americans\\".\\"Killing Fields Leader 'killed himself',\\" BBC News, January 21, 1999 Interview with Kang Kek Iew In April 1999 Thayer, alongside photojournalist Nic Dunlop, interviewed Kang Kek Iew (Comrade Duch) for the Far Eastern Economic Review after Dunlop had tracked Duch to Samlaut and suspected strongly that he was the former director of the notorious S-21 security prison.Nic Dunlop, The Lost Executioner: A Journey to the Heart of the Killing Fields. New York: Walker & Company, 2006. Dunlop wanted Duch to provide clues that would reveal his identity, and Thayer began probing Duch's story that he was Hang Pin, an aid worker and a born-again Christian: :\\"Then Nate said, 'I believe that you also worked with the security services during the Khmer Rouge Period?' Duch appeared startled and avoided our eyes...Again Nate put the question to him...He looked unsettled and his eyes darted about...He then glanced at Nate's business card...'I believe, Nic, that your friend has interviewed Monsieur Ta Mok and Monsieur Pol Pot?'...He sat back down...and inhaled deeply. 'It is God's will that you are here,' he said.\\"Dunlop, 2006, pp. 271‚Äì72.\\"70's Torturer in Cambodia Now 'Doing God's Work',\\" The New York Times, May 2, 1999 Duch surrendered to the authorities in Phnom Penh following the publication of this interview.Nic Dunlop and Nate Thayer, \\"Duch Confesses,\\" Far Eastern Economic Review, May 6, 1999; vol 170, no. 3:, p. 76.

KKK and white supremacists In 2015, Thayer was the author of a controversial series of articles about race demonstrations in Charleston, South Carolina, in the wake of shootings carried out by Dylann Roof. The stories, which were first published in MarxRand, eventually attracted attention from the mainstream press. In particular, a story called \\"Patriot Games\\" was picked up by mainstream news organizations after being published on MarxRand, and subsequently commissioned as a separate story run in Vice later the same week. In the original version of the story, Thayer claimed that a Ku Klux Klan leader named Chris Barker was doubling as an undercover FBI operative \\"working for and protected by the U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force.\\" As a result of Barker's outing, Thayer wrote in September 2015 that \\"Mr Barker (has called and) hung up the phone several times, sent me incendiary emails and made threatening phone calls, and has since gone on White Nationalist internet forums to try to denounce the articles and defend his reputation\\" and that other Klan members had \\"threatened to decapitate my dog.\\" Plagiarism controversy Blogger Jeremy Duns accused Thayer of plagiarism on March 7, 2013,Jeremy Duns, \\"Nate Thayer is a Plagiarist.\\" a claim that was echoed in New York magazine.Joe Coscarelli, \\"Did Nate Thayer Plagiarize in the Article The Atlantic Wanted for Free?\\" Mark Ziegler, author of the article in question, told the Columbia Journalism Review that he was \\"not ready to accuse Thayer of plagiarism,\\" and said \\"I have no reason not to respect him as a fellow journalist.\\" Ziegler said he was \\"not completely satisfied with the way [his article] was ultimately attributed\\" even in the corrected version of \\"25 Years of Slam Dunk Diplomacy\\".Nate Thayer, \\"25 Years of Slam Dunk Diplomacy\\", NKNews, March 4 2013. The Columbia Journalism Review concluded that Thayer's \\"attribution was sloppy and he represented quotes that were said in other places as if they were said to him\\" but that it did not appear to be a case of plagiarism. The CJR interviewed Thayer's sources, and at least one confirmed he was interviewed extensively by Thayer.

The event lasted for three days, 24 hours a day, and included talks, a programming contest and several satellite activities combining entertainment with geek culture. It was free for attendees, including food and drinks, but they had to undergo a screening process due to the limited number of seats. The SAPO Codebits brand is still owned by SAPO (an Altice operation since 2015) but the team that organized the event has since moved on. In 2016, the team at Bright Pixel (composed mostly of SAPO ex-employees at the time) rebooted the event under a new brand (Pixels Camp) but retaining more-or-less the same format.  Format  Participants preparing to present their projects at the first SAPO Codebits in 2007 The event took place over three consecutive days (and nights), starting on a Thursday. Thursday morning was composed of general keynotes. The programming contest started on the afternoon along with parallel tracks of talks (from invited speakers and self-proposed by participants), both lasting until Saturday morning. Saturday afternoon was reserved for the programming contest presentations and awards ceremony. Entertaiment-focused satellite activities were usually held in the evenings. These included the \\"Nuclear Tacos\\" competition over dinner, the Quiz Show, the Security CTF, the Presentation Karaoke, and sometimes other activities as well. During the night there were the occasional movie projections, but it was mostly a time for participants to work on their projects and sleep in random places around the venue (which was open 24h a day). Programming competition projects could tackle any subject the teams chose to follow, but had to be developed over the three days of the event. Some of them ended up receiving sponsorship from SAPO afterwards.  Candidate selection  Those wanting to attend the event had to apply to attend. Applicants who did not work with technology directly, such as those in marketing, were rejected. Attendees included developers, systems administrators, web designers, etc.  Partners  While SAPO organized the whole event by itself, other companies stepped in as partners, either bringing in gadgets, demos, or other things. Partners included: * O'Reilly - present from 2007 to 2014, with a book stand offering discounts on their books * Microsoft - present from 2007 to 2014 with consoles such as Xbox and occasionally with other projects such as the Interactive Canvas * PT Inova√ß√£o - present from 2007 to 2014 with Meo in Portuguese and other telecom related technologies * Cisco - present from 2007 to 2014, providing the network solution every year and occasionally showcasing projects such as Hologram solutions  Editions  * 2014 - April 10‚Äì12 - MEO Arena, Lisbon - 900 attendees * 2012 - November 16‚Äì18 - Pavilh√£o Atl√¢ntico, Lisbon - 800 attendees * 2011 - November 10‚Äì12 - Pavilh√£o Atl√¢ntico, Lisbon - 800 attendees * 2010 - November 11‚Äì13 - Pavilh√£o Atl√¢ntico, Lisbon - 700 attendees * 2009 - December 3‚Äì5 - Cordoaria Nacional, Lisbon - 600 attendees * 2008 - LX Factory, Lisbon - 500 attendees * 2007 - Gare Mar√≠tima de Alc√¢ntara, Lisbon - 400 attendees  Keynotes  * Some of 2010's keynotes ** Brian Suda - \\"Collecting and Visualizing Data\\" ** Peter Svensson - \\"The rise of Server-side JavaScript\\" ** Bruno Pedro - \\"Everything OAuth\\" ** Tiago Henriques - \\"Computer Forensics - The Digital CSI - What, Why and How\\" ** Jorge Teixeira - \\"Mining Online News\\" * Some of 2009's keynotes ** Kai Seidler - \\"Think before you develop!\\" ** Remy Sharp - \\"HTML5 JavaScript APIs\\" ** Robert Nymann - \\"JavaScript: From Birth to Closure\\" ** Brian Suda - \\"Optional is required\\" ** Brian LeRoux - \\"PhoneGap: Mobile App Developer Zero to Hero\\" * Some of 2008's keynotes ** Jan Lehnardt - \\"CouchDB\\" ** Andrew \\"Bunnie\\" Huang - \\"Making the Chumby\\" ** Jack Moffitt - \\"Exploring XMPP\\" ** Marcus Bauer - \\"Getting started with mobile devices development - Openmoko Freerunner\\" ** Mitch Altman - \\"Hardware Hacking area: Make Cool Things with Microcontrollers (and learn to solder)\\" ** Peter Svensson \\\\- \\"Practical Thin Server Architecture with Dojo\\" * Some of 2007's keynotes ** Mike Culver - \\"Amazon WebServices Architecture\\" and \\"Enterprise WebApp development with Tapestry\\" ** Mahesh Prakriya - \\"IronPython and Dynamic Languages on .NET\\" ** Jim Purbrick - \\"Mashing up the Web, Games, Music, Movies, Money and The Laws Of Physics in Second Life\\", in Di√°rio de Not√≠cias  Satellite events  Satellite events have included concerts (Wray Gun in 2007, Pornophonique in 2009), a Quiz Show, gaming events and workshops on soldering, lockpicking, 3d printing and other areas.

The parent company of the site, Thematic Media (\\"–¢–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –ú–µ–¥–∏–∞\\") developed a group of websites (\\"–¢–æ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä\\" toster.ru, \\"–ú–µ–≥–∞–º–æ–∑–≥\\" megamozg.ru, \\"–ú–æ–∑–≥–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª–∏—â–µ\\" brainstorage.me, \\"–§—Ä–∏–ª–∞–Ω—Å–∏–º\\" freelansim.ru) after they developed habrahabr.ru. In 2007, Habrahabr received two nominations in the ROTOR contest (), which awards prizes to Russian-language web projects. Habrahabr was nominated for the Discovery of the Year () and Online Community of the Year () prizes. The website's author, Denis Kryuchkov, was nominated for the Producer of the Year prize (). In 2009, the website was again nominated for the Online Community of the Year prize. Sections Blogs The blogs comprise three sections: theme-specific, personal and corporate blogs. Each team blog consists of two sections, both of which contain entries that go by the moniker \\"habratopiki\\" (in Russian, \\"—Ö–∞–±—Ä–∞—Ç–æ–ø–∏–∫–∏\\") in the Habr environment. The first section, titled \\"zahabrennye\\" (in Russian, \\"–∑–∞—Ö–∞–±—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ\\"), broadcasts entries that have received high approval from users of the website. The second section, called \\"othabrennye\\" (in Russian, \\"–æ—Ç—Ö–∞–±—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ\\"), contains habratopiki that have received disapproval by users of the Habr platform. Topic-specific blogs, which go by the name \\"Haby\\" (the plural form of the Russian adaptation of the word \\"hub\\"), include sections devoted to programming, IT security, DIY projects, self-care, popular science, open source software, vintage hardware, game development, transportation, programming language-specific threads, and others. Habr's corporate blogs are authored by companies that include Google, Yandex, Intel, Microsoft, Samsung, and ABBYY, among others. Questions and Answers (Q & A) Since the autumn of 2010 has hosted a questions and answers service, similar to Google services FAQ. In this section, any user can ask questions about IT-related topics and receive answers from other members of the project. In 2013, the Q&A; section separated from the main portal Habrahbr, and can now be found under a section that is separated from the main Habr portal. People The \\"people\\" section provides statistics on registered users (distribution by country and region, the number of registered and active users) and includes user rating, built on the basis of their habrasily. In the present karmagraf - a graph showing the cumulative change indicators karma users. Corporate Rating companies, one way or another connected with the sphere of high technologies. Basis rating - the assessment by users of a particular company. Job board The section devoted to industry job boards. All resumes and vacancies divided by sector (\\"consulting, outsourcing,\\" \\"Optimizing sites (SEO)¬ª, ¬´Media\\", etc.). Position can accommodate only a user with a non-negative karma. Summary Users with negative karma will not appear in the list summary. Sandbox Sandbox is designed for posts from read-only users. Posts get there from users who have not yet received access to commenting and creating posts without pre- moderation. After hitting the post in the sandbox it is to see someone from \\"zahabrennyh,\\" and if he is interested in the post, it will be added to the main section.  Mechanisms  * Karma - The karma is a value assigned to each user. It can only be changed by other users. It is a form of community-driven moderation, since a user's karma level determines their privileges. To publish posts, for example, users must have a positive karma value. * Rating - The rating is another value assigned to each user. Rating depends on Karma, positive and negative votes of other users for posts and comments. However, the exact algorithm has not been disclosed by the website. * Voting for topics and comments - This allows users to show their opinion about posts.

The Rahon and the Sikh soldiers who were captured were cremated there. There are eight gurudwaras, three Hindu temples, and three mosques in Urapar. The late Sardar Sampuran Singh Sena was the only sarpanch (head of a village) who had served four terms (20 years) in a row. He was also the first sarpanch after the city gained its freedom. During his tenure as sarpanch, he established a veterinary clinic. In appreciation of his community services, the Governor of Punjab gave him a commendatory certificate at the opening ceremony. He approached Chotu Ram, the Education Minister of Joint Punjab, to upgrade Khalsa Elementary School of Chak-Urapar to a high school. There are more than 100 families from Urapar currently living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Every year they get together and celebrate Urapar Day. Demographics As of the 2001 India census, Urapar had a population of 4,251 (52% male and 48% female). Urapar has an average literacy rate of 87%, higher than the national average of 74% (male literacy is 79%, and female literacy is 71%). In Nawanshahr, 12% of the population is under nine years of age.

It today forms parts of the towns of Oakville, Milton, and Halton Hills in the Regional Municipality of Halton. Named after Cape Trafalgar where Horatio Nelson led the English fleet to victory over the Spanish and French at the Battle of Trafalgar, the township was created in 1806. Trafalgar was one of three townships surveyed by Samuel Street Wilmot after the purchase of land from the Mississaugas in 1805. The boundaries extended from Lake Ontario in the south to Steeles Avenue in the north, and from Winston Churchill Boulevard in the east to Burloak Drive in the west. In 1962, the township was amalgamated into Oakville. Dundas Street was the main transportation corridor through the township. Wheat was the main agricultural crop of farms in the township for most of its history with the crop taking up from one quarter to one third of the cultivated land.

The diocese rejects the ordination of women as priests (or presbyters) and bishops. Diocesan position One of the differences between Sydney and the majority of other Anglican dioceses in Australia has been its unwillingness to allow the ordination of women to the priesthood (itself a term infrequently used in the diocese) or presbyterate. This issue is an indicator of Sydney's difference in ecclesiology and theology to most other dioceses within the Anglican Communion. For many Anglicans outside Evangelical churches and even for many Sydney Anglicans within Evangelical churches, the central act of worship is the celebration of the Eucharist. Within the Anglican Communion the Eucharist can only be presided over by an ordained priest (presbyter). For many who have opposed the ordination of women the sex of the priest who presides at the Eucharist has been a major issue. But in the Sydney diocese the sex of the person who presides at the Eucharist is of less significance than the matter of headship in the church and in the preaching and teaching which is central to Evangelical ministry. Interpretations of the teachings of Paul The reason for Sydney's strong opposition towards the ordination of women to the presbyterate is based partly upon their interpretation of the teachings of the Apostle Paul in respect to the understanding of the Greek word kephale (Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒ∑) mentioned in Ephesians 5:23, as well as the prohibition given to female teachers in 1 Timothy 2:11 and the roles of men and women outlined in his first letter to the Corinthians. The diocese has, however, ordained women as deacons since 1989.http://www.sydneyanglicans.net/portal/historyofsydneydiocese.pdf Women who are ordained as priests outside the diocese, such as Sue Pain who returned to Sydney to take up the position of assistant at St James', King Street, are acknowledged by the diocese as a deacons rather than priests.Lu Piper: \\"The situation was akin to becoming an apprentice plumber and staying an apprentice for the rest of your life no matter how good your qualification....\\" as quoted by Julia Baird, SMH 27 May 2002 In 1994 Harry Goodhew appointed a deacon, Dianne Nicolios, as archdeacon in charge of women's ministries.  Legal action In 1992 a then member of the standing committee of the diocesan synod, Laurie Scandrett, joined with Dalba Primmer (the then Rector of St John's Bega in the Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn) and David Robarts (then the incumbent of Christ Church, Brunswick in the Diocese of Melbourne) in a court action (Scandrett v Dowling (1992) 27 NSWLR 483) to prevent the Bishop of Canberra and Goulburn from ordaining women as presbyters. The action failed in the New South Wales Court of Appeal although it delayed the ordination by several months. Continuing disagreement Sydney's stand on this issue has been a source of bitterness for a minority within the diocese, as indicated by the bulletins of the Movement for the Ordination of Women, as well as an occasional cause of tension between Sydney and the Diocese of Melbourne. However, a number of prominent Sydney Anglicans who are supportive of the ordination of women have ministered or are currently ministering in Melbourne ‚Äî for example Peter Watson (Archbishop of Melbourne, 2000‚Äì2006),Philip Freier enthroned as 10th Archbishop of Melbourne Stephen Hale, Bishop of the Eastern Region and Dianne Nicolios, Archdeacon for Women's Ministries.

It is traditionally not acknowledged to be one of the places where St Thomas, an apostle of Jesus, lived and preached when he came to India. In 1551 AD, Portuguese built a Church over the site where St Thomas is believed to have lived in. Later, in the year 1970, a part of this old Church was demolished and a larger circular Church was built to accommodate more devotees. Little Mount now is a mixed-use residential and commercial area. The neighbourhood houses the IX Metropolitan Magistrates Court (Saidapet). Other Governmental offices located on the periphery of Little Mount include Raj Bhavan (the residence of the governor of Tamil Nadu), the headquarters of the state's Highways Department, and Panagal Maligai, which houses several government offices. Current developments in and around Little Mount include the New Life Assembly of God (NLAG) Church, Checkers Hotel, Lemon Tree Hotel, and the Temple Steps office complex. Little Mount is a stop on Line 1 of the Chennai Metro that runs between Washermanpet and the Airport.  St. Thomas  St. Thomas is believed to have stayed in a tiny cave in Little Mount. He led a spartan prayerful life in solitude, often praying on the top of the hill and preaching to the local crowds that gathered to hear the Good news. The cave is well preserved even today and can be accessed from the old Church (chinna kovil) and is used for prayer and meditation by the devotees from all creeds. On the other side of the cave is an opening through which St. Thomas is said to have fled to escape this assailants. At the front of this opening are the hand and foot imprints of St. Thomas etched on the rock. A little farther away from the cave is an eternal spring from which is believed to be a work of St. Thomas. When St. Thomas was thirsty, he split the rocks and drank the refreshing water that gushed forth from the spring.  shrine of apostle St Thomas & Our Lady of Health Church  The Portuguese realized the importance of this sacred place and in 1551 AD, built a Church in honor of Our Lady of Health. A part of this Church still exists despite several renovations and development activities around it. You can access the cave, in which St. Thomas lived, from a small entrance at the left side of the altar of this Church.  Developments Around the Church  Recent developments in and around the Church include developing a large tract of land behind the Church as Holy Land. All stations of the cross and a few stations of rosary are built in concrete on this land. The altar at the Holy Land is said to have been finished in Italy and blessed by the Pope before it was installed here. New buildings in the Church campus include an adoration chapel, next to the old Church, a new parish office, at the other side of the circular Church, and a pulpit and altar to hold festival celebrations.  Church Festival  The annual feast of Our Lady of Health is held on the fifth Saturday after Easter. It is preceded by flag hoisting nine days earlier and Novena. On each day, mass and prayers are offered for special intentions of a specific category of people. On the feast day, the high mass is followed by a car procession around the Church. Next evening, the flag is lowered after a high mass.  Status of the Church  Recently the Church was elevated to the status of a Shrine. Now it is referred as \\"Shrine of Our Lady of Health.\\" Masses are offered regularly (at 6:15 AM, 11:30 AM, and 6:00 PM during weekdays and (6:30 AM, 8:00 AM, 11:30 AM, and 5:00 PM during Sundays).

She founded the NSW branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in 1960, and in 2001 was made a Member of the Order of Australia for her services to the community. Biography Cover of Margaret Holmes' biography, written by Michelle Cavanagh and published in 2006 Margaret was born into a wealthy Sydney family on 24 January 1909, the eldest of five children, and grew up in Wahroonga. She attended The Women's College, University of Sydney, where she was the first female student to have a car, and studied medicine. While at university, Margaret became involved with the Christian Student Movement and identified with Christian pacifism. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science and in 1933 married a doctor, T. A. G. (Tag) Holmes, instead of becoming one. Margaret and Tag Holmes built a large family home in Military Road, Mosman, a suburb on Sydney's Lower North Shore. Here T. A. G. Holmes had his medical practice and they raised six children. At the beginning of World War II, as many Europeans escaped to Australia, the Holmeses established the \\"50-50 Club\\", a weekly social evening where \\"new Australians\\" could get to know the locals and better integrate into their new society. These cultural events were attended by many European artists and intellectuals, often with musical performances and national dishes from afar. However, as the threat of war entered the Pacific and blackouts and curfews were imposed in Sydney, the Holmeses were informed by the police that these gatherings should end. In 1959, Margaret made a world trip to attend the congress of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in Stockholm; She had come to know of this long-standing women's peace organisation in 1940 through articles in The Peacemaker written by Eleanor Moore. As there was no Sydney branch of WILPF at that time, she joined as an international member. This was to be the beginning of a long and active involvement with WILPF, including founding the NSW Branch when she returned from the congress. Her trip included travelling to Austria for an IFOR conference, to Russia (where she delivered smuggled bibles to the Moscow Baptist Church) and to India (at the invitation of Sushila Nayar, whom she had met at the WILPF congress). It was in the 1960s during the Vietnam War when Margaret's activism became most public. She led demonstrations including the walk-out (details) and was a regular campaigner in downtown Sydney, participating in prayer vigils, candlelight vigils, public meetings and leaflet distribution. During this time she also became active in campaigning for Aboriginal rights and nuclear disarmament. Her biography, Margaret Holmes: The Life and Times of an Australian Peace Campaigner, written by Michelle Cavanagh, was published in 2006. Her life has also been documented in various oral histories and other material, some of which is held by the Australian War Memorial. Honours  In 2001, Margaret was made a Member of the Order of Australia at the Queen's Birthday Honours, \\"for service to the community through organisations promoting peace, human rights and conflict resolution, particularly as a member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom\\". She had been a reluctant nominee for the award, only accepting it in the hope that it might help to promote WILPF. Death  Margaret celebrated her 100th birthday on 24 January 2009 at her home in Sydney, in the company of her six children and nearly all of her nine grandchildren and ten great- grandchildren. She died peacefully on 10 September 2009 in Coffs Harbour, Australia, at the home of her eldest son Bill.

Several provinces, however, and certain dioceses within otherwise ordaining provinces, continue to ordain only men. Disputes over the ordination of women have contributed to the establishment and growth of progressive tendencies, such the Anglican realignment and Continuing Anglican movements. Some provinces within the Anglican Communion ordain women to the three traditional holy orders of bishop, priest and deacon. Other provinces ordain women as deacons and priests but not as bishops; others still as deacons only. Within provinces which permit the ordination of women, approval of enabling legislation is largely a diocesan responsibility. There may, however, be individual dioceses which do not endorse the legislation, or do so only in a modified form, as in those dioceses which ordain women only to the diaconate (such as the Diocese of Sydney in the Anglican Church of Australia), regardless of whether or not the ordination of women to all three orders of ministry is canonically possible. Overview The current situation regarding women's ordination in the Anglican Communion can be seen in the following table, which lists the 38 member churches and the 6 extra-provincial churches: { |- !

In provinces where individual dioceses have considerable autonomy (e.g. the Anglican Church of Australia), some dioceses may be less permissive than the province overall. Ordination of priests The first woman ordained to the priesthood in the Anglican Communion was Florence Li Tim-Oi, who was ordained on 25 January 1944 by Ronald Hall, Bishop of Victoria, Hong Kong, in response to the crisis among Anglican Christians in China caused by the Japanese invasion. To avoid controversy, she resigned her licence (though not her priestly orders) after the end of the war. In 1971, the Synod of Hong Kong and Macao became the first Anglican province to officially permit the ordination of women to the priesthood. Jane Hwang and Joyce M. Bennett were ordained as priests by Gilbert Baker, Bishop of Hong Kong and Macao on November 28, 1971. At the same time, Li Tim-Oi was officially recognised again as a priest.\\"When Hong Kong ordained two further women priests in 1971 (Joyce Bennett and Jane Hwang), Florence Li Tim-Oi was officially recognised as a priest by the diocese\\" http://anorderlyaccount.com/index.php/static2/the_ac_tec_and_acna In 1974, in the United States, 11 women (known as the \\"Philadelphia Eleven\\") were controversially ordained to the priesthood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by three retired Episcopal Church bishops (Daniel Corrigan, Robert L. DeWitt and Edward R. Welles). Four more women (the \\"Washington Four\\") were ordained in 1975 in Washington D.C. by George W. Barrett, retired Bishop of Rochester, New York. All of these ordinations were ruled \\"irregular\\" because they had been done without the authorisation of the Episcopal Church's General Convention. The ordinations were regularised in 1976 following the approval by the General Convention of measures to provide for the ordination of women to the priesthood and the episcopate. The first regular ordination occurred on 1 January 1977, when Jacqueline Means was ordained at the Episcopal Church of All Saints, Indianapolis.\\"Woman Episcopal Priest Celebrates Communion\\", New York Times, 3 January 1977. In 1975, the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada (ACC) passed enabling legislation for women priests; the first six women priests in the ACC were ordained on November 30, 1976. In 1977, the Anglican Church in New Zealand ordained five female priests. In 1980, the Anglican Church of Kenya agreed in principle that women could be ordained, and that each diocese was to be autonomous in taking up the issue. In 1983, Henry Okullu, bishop of the Diocese of Maseno South in the Anglican Church of Kenya, ordained Lucia Okuthe as priest. In the same year, William Rukirande, Bishop of Kigezi in the Church of Uganda, ordained three women as priest, Monica Sebidega, Deborah Micungwa Rukara and Margaret Kizanye Byekwaso. Formal legislation for the ordination of women as priests was ultimately approved in both provinces in 1990. In 1990, Janet Catterall became the first woman ordained an Anglican priest in Ireland. In 1992, the general synod of the Anglican Church of Australia approved legislation allowing dioceses to decide whether to ordain women to the priesthood. In the same year, 90 women were ordained in Australia and two others who had been ordained overseas were recognised. Also in 1992, the Anglican Church of Southern Africa authorised the ordination of women as priests and, in September that year, Nancy Charton, Bride Dickson and Sue Groves were ordained in the Diocese of Grahamstown. Also in 1992, the General Synod of the Church of England passed a vote to ordain women; however, it proved controversial. The Act of Synod, passed in 1993, along with further legislation, allowed parishes to not accept ordained women. In 1994 England's first thirty-two women were ordained as priests. The experience of the first women priests and their congregations was the premise of the television programme The Vicar of Dibley. The legality of the ordination of women in the Church of England was challenged in civil courts by Paul Williamson and others. By 2004, one in five priests was a woman. In 1994, in the Diocese of Barbados, Sonia Hinds and Beverley Sealy became the first women to be ordained as deacons in the Church in the Province of the West Indies on 25 July, the Feast of St James. On 31 May 1996, on the Feast of the Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth, both women were ordained as priests. Rufus Brome, the first Barbadian-born bishop, presided at both ordinations at the Cathedral of St Michael and All Angels in Bridgetown, Barbados. In 1997, Rosalina Villaruel Rabaria became the first woman ordained in the Philippines Independent Church, in the Diocese of Aklan and Capiz on 9 February. In 2015, Bolivia became the first diocese in the Anglican Province of South America (formerly known as the Southern Cone) to ordain women as priests. Also in 2015, Susana Lopez Lerena, Cynthia Myers Dickin, and Audrey Taylor Gonzalez became the first women Anglican priests ordained in the Diocese of Uruguay. Ordination of bishops Episcopal Church in the United States Katharine Jefferts Schori, Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church (2006‚Äì2015), the first female primate in the Anglican Communion The first woman to become a bishop in the Anglican Communion was Barbara Harris, who was ordained suffragan bishop of Massachusetts in the United States in February 1989. As of August 2017, 24 women have since been elected to the episcopate across the church. The election in December 2009 and consecration on 15 May 2010 of Mary Glasspool, who is openly gay and lives with her partner of 20 years, as a suffragan bishop in the Diocese of Los Angeles attracted attention owing to the continued controversy over gay bishops in Anglicanism.Episcopal Life Online, 15 May 2010. The Episcopal Church in the United States also elected the first woman to become a primate (or senior bishop of a national church), Katharine Jefferts Schori, who was elected as 26th Presiding Bishop and Primate of the Episcopal Church at the 2006 General Convention for a nine- year term (2006-2015). Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia The Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia first ordained women as priests in 1977 and was the first Anglican province to elect a woman as a diocesan bishop when, in 1989, Penny Jamieson was elected Bishop of Dunedin. She retired in 2004. In 2008 the Diocese of Christchurch elected Victoria Matthews, former Bishop of Edmonton in the Anglican Church of Canada, as 8th Bishop of Christchurch. In 2013, Helen-Ann Hartley became the first woman ordained in the Church of England to become a bishop when she was elected as Bishop of Waikato and joint diocesan bishop in the Diocese of Waikato and Taranaki.Since 2017, the Rt Rev Dr Eleanor Sanderson has served as Assistant Bishop of Wellington. Wai Quayle became the first indigenous woman to be elected a bishop in the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia in 2019. Anglican Church of Canada Following the first ordinations of women as priests in 1976,\\"Ordination of Women in the Anglican Church of Canada\\" the first woman to become a bishop in the Anglican Church of Canada was Victoria Matthews. She was elected suffragan bishop in the Diocese of Toronto on 19 November 1993 and was ordained to the episcopate on 12 February 1994. She later was the first woman to become a diocesan bishop in Canada when she was elected as Bishop of Edmonton in 1997, an office she held until 2007 when she resigned. She was subsequently elected Bishop of Christchurch in the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia in 2008. Since Matthews' election, twelve more women have been elected to the episcopate in Canada. They are Ann Tottenham (suffragan, Toronto, 1997; retired 2005); Sue Moxley (suffragan, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, 2004; diocesan, 2007; retired 2014); Jane Alexander (diocesan, Edmonton, 2008); Linda Nicholls (suffragan, Toronto, 2008; diocesan, Huron, 2016; Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada, 2019 https://gs2019.anglican.ca/primate/results/); Barbara Andrews (Bishop Suffragan to the Metropolitan with responsibilities for the Anglican Parishes of the Central Interior, 2009); Lydia Mamakwa (Area Bishop for Northern Ontario within the Diocese of Keewatin, with special responsibility for the predominantly Aboriginal parishes of the area, 2010; subsequently Bishop of Mishamikoweesh, the church's Indigenous Spiritual Ministry with the status of a diocese, established in 2014);Wawatay News Online, 13 May 2010.

On 12 May 2018 Melissa Skelton was elected Metropolitan (which includes the title 'Archbishop') of the Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and Yukon. Anglican Church of Australia The Anglican Church of Australia began to ordain women as priests in 1992 and in the late 1990s embarked on a protracted debate over the ordination of women as bishops, a debate that was ultimately decided though the church's appellate tribunal, which ruled on 28 September 2007 that there is nothing in the church's constitution that would prevent the consecration of a woman priest as a bishop in a diocese which by ordinance has adopted the law of the Church of England Clarification Canon 1992, which paved the way for the ordination of women as priests. Following the agreement at the April 2008 bishops' conference of the \\"Women in the Episcopate\\" protocol for the provision of pastoral care to those who reject the ministry of bishops who are women, the first women ordained as bishops were Kay Goldsworthy (assistant bishop, Diocese of Perth) on 22 May 2008 (subsequently elected 12th bishop of the Diocese of Gippsland in the south-eastern Australian state of Victoria and installed on 21 March 2015; and Barbara Darling (assistant bishop, Anglican Diocese of Melbourne) on 31 May 2008. Four more women have since been ordained as bishops: Genieve Blackwell, Regional Bishop in Wagga Wagga and subsequently an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Melbourne (31 March 2012); Alison Taylor, Bishop of the Southern Region, Diocese of Brisbane (6 April 2013); Sarah Macneil, Bishop of Grafton, who was the first woman to be a diocesan bishop in the church (1 March 2014); and Kate Wilmot, an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Perth (6 August 2015).\\"Announcement by the Archbishop of Perth\\", 9 May 2015. On 29 August 2017 Kay Goldsworthy was elected Archbishop of Perth in the Province of Western Australia.ABC Online On taking up her appointment on 10 February 2018, she became the first woman in the Anglican Communion appointed or elected to the office of archbishop. Anglican Church of Southern Africa The first woman to become a bishop in the Anglican Church of South Africa was Ellinah Ntombi Wamukoya, who was elected bishop of the Diocese of Swaziland on 18 July 2012http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2012/07/[updated]-first-female-anglican- bishop-for-africa-elected-in-a-spirit-filled-atmosphere.aspx and ordained and installed on 10 November 2012. Her appointment was closely followed by the election, on 12 October 2012, of Margaret Vertue as bishop of the Diocese of False Bay. She was consecrated and installed on 19 January 2013. Church in Wales On 2 April 2008, the Governing Body of the Church in Wales considered, but did not pass, a bill to enable women to be ordained as bishops. Though the bill was passed by the House of Laity (52 to 19) and the House of Bishops (unanimously), it failed by three votes (27 to 18) to secure the required minimum two-thirds majority in the House of Clerics. However, the Church in Wales decisively ended the role of provincial bishop, whose responsibility was to minister to opponents. On 12 September 2013, the Governing Body passed a bill to enable women to be ordained as bishopsChurch in Wales backs women bishops. BBC News Wales, Sept 12 2013\\"Female bishops voted in by Church in Wales\\", The Guardian, 12 September 2013. subject to the finalisation of a Code of Practice, ultimately published in September 2014.Women Bishops Code of Practice , Church in Wales website On 2 November 2016, Joanna Penberthy was elected as Bishop of St David's in the Church in Wales. She was consecrated in January 2017 and enthroned in St Davids Cathedral in February 2017. On 25 February 2017 June Osborne was elected 72nd Bishop of Llandaff. She was consecrated on 15 July 2017 and installed at Llandaff Cathedral on 22 July 2017. Church of England Since the ordination of women as priests began in 1994, dioceses generally have on the Bishop's senior staff a Dean of Women's Ministry (or Bishop's Adviser in Women's Ministry or similar), whose role it is to advocate for clergy who are women and to ensure the Bishop is appraised of issues peculiar to their ministry. These Advisers meet together in a National Association (NADAWM).National Association of Diocesan Adviser in Women's Ministry (Accessed 7 January 2018) In 2005, 2006 and 2008 the General Synod of the Church of England voted in favour of removing the legal obstacles preventing women from becoming bishops. The process did not progress quickly due to problems in providing appropriate mechanisms for the protection of those who cannot accept this development. On 7 July 2008 the synod held a more-than- seven-hour debate on the subject and narrowly voted in favour of a national statutory code of practice to make provision for opponents, though more radical provisions (such as separate structures or overseeing bishops) proposed by opponents of the measure failed to win the majority required across each of the three houses (bishops, clergy and laity). The task of taking this proposal further fell largely to a revision committee established by the synod to consider the draft legislation on enabling women to become bishops in the Church of England. When, in October 2009, the revision committee released a statement indicating its proposals would include a plan to vest some functions by law in male bishops who would provide oversight for those unable to receive ministry of women as bishops or priests, there was widespread concern both within and outside the Church of England about the appropriateness of such legislation. In the light of the negative reaction to the proposal, the revision committee subsequently announced the abandonment of this recommendation. The synod, meeting in York from 9 to 12 July 2010, considered a measure that again endorsed the ordination of women as bishops. The measure included provisions for individual bishops to allow alternative oversight for traditionalists who object to serving under them, but opponents of the measure argued for stronger provisions. A compromise plan put forward by the archbishops of Canterbury and York (involving the creation of a mechanism providing for \\"co-ordinate jurisdiction\\" in parishes refusing the ministry of a bishop who is a woman whereby another bishop would fulfil episcopal function) was endorsed by the House of Bishops and the House of Laity but narrowly failed (90 votes against to 85 in favour) in the House of Clergy.The Guardian Online, \\"Church of England faces crisis as Synod rejects concession on women bishops\\", 10 July 2010. The draft measure, with only minor amendments, passed in all three houses on 12 July 2010, to be considered by individual dioceses. The measure was approved by 42 of the 44 dioceses, but an amendment by the House of Bishops, offering further concessions to opponents, meant that many proponents of the measure would have reluctantly voted it down, and the synod at York in July 2012 adjourned the decision to a later synod.\\"Archbishop warns against delay over women bishops\\", The Guardian, 12 July 2010. On 20 November 2012, the General Synod failed to pass the proposed legislation for the ordination of women as bishops. The measure was lost after narrowly failing to achieve the two-thirds majority required in the House of Laity after being passed by the House of Bishops and the House of Clergy. At its meeting on 7 February 2013, the House of Bishops decided that eight senior women clergy, elected regionally, would participate in all meetings of the house until such time as there were six women who were bishops sitting as of right. In May 2013 the House of Bishops expressed its commitment \\"to publishing new ways forward to enable women to become bishops\\".\\"Women Bishops\\", Church of England website, May 2013. In July 2013, the synod decided to reintroduce legislation to be addressed in November. In November 2013 the General Synod approved a package of measures as the next steps to enable women to become bishops, generally welcoming a package of proposals outlined for Draft Legislation of Women in the Episcopate (GS 1924). The steering committee's package of proposals followed the mandate set by the July synod and included the first draft of a House of Bishops declaration and a disputes resolution procedure. The debate invited the synod to welcome the proposals and five guiding principles already agreed by the House of Bishops. The General Synod again considered the matter in February 2014 and sent further draft legislation to all the dioceses of the Church of England. All dioceses that were able to meet within the necessary time frame (43 of 44) approved the draft legislation in time for it be debated at the General Synod in York in July 2014. That legislation passed all three houses of General Synod on 14 July 2014, achieving the two-thirds majority required in all three. It gained the necessary parliamentary approvals and royal assent in the subsequent months and was finally approved by the General Synod on 17 November 2014. The first woman to be ordained as a bishop in the Church of England was Libby Lane, whose appointment as Bishop of Stockport (a suffragan see in the Diocese of Chester) was announced on 17 December 2014.

Church of Ireland The Church of Ireland approved the ordination of women as priests and bishops in 1990 and the first women were ordained as priests on 24 June that year. The first woman in the episcopate was Pat Storey, who was consecrated Bishop of Meath and Kildare on 1 December 2013.Irish Examiner, 20 September 2013 On 19 September 2013, Storey was chosen by the House of Bishops to succeed Richard Clarke as Bishop of Meath and Kildare.

Several have provided for the ordination of women as priests for some years. The Episcopal Church of Cuba is the only extra-provincial church to ordain women as bishops, the first of whom was Nerva Cot Aguilera who was appointed as a bishop suffragan in 2007.Aguilera, 71, died suddenly on 10 July 2010 after a brief illness with severe anemia. Episcopal Life Online item, 11 July 2010. Aguilera was appointed by the Metropolitan Council, the ecclesiastical authority for the Episcopal Church of Cuba which in January 2010 appointed Griselda Delgato Del Carpio (who, along with Aguilera, was one of the first two women priests ordained in Cuba in 1986) as bishop coadjutor (assistant bishop with the right of succession). She was ordained to the episcopate on 7 February 2010 and installed as diocesan on 28 November 2010 following the retirement of Miguel Tamayo-Zald√≠var. Controversies and breakaway groups The ordination of women has been a controversial issue throughout the Anglican Communion. While the majority of the 38 provinces of the Anglican Communion ordain women as priests, and many have removed all barriers to women becoming bishops, some have taken formal or informal steps to provide pastoral care and support for those who cannot in conscience accept the ministry of women as priests and bishops. The Church of England, for example, has created the office of provincial episcopal visitor (colloquially known as \\"flying bishops\\") to minister to clergy, laity and parishes who do not in conscience accept the ministry of women priests. These are suffragan bishops, appointed by the metropolitans, whose main purpose is to be available for this ministry. There have been a number of protest groups established by conservative Anglicans who see the ordination of women as representative of a trend away from traditional or orthodox doctrine. A network for opponents of women's ordination called the Evangelical and Catholic Mission was established in 1976, and following the consecration of Barbara Harris, the first woman to become an Anglican bishop, in 1989, a group of 22 active and retired bishops established the Episcopal Synod of America, subsequently Forward in Faith North America. A sister organisation, Forward in Faith UK, was established in 1992. There have also been a number of breakaway groups. Following the Congress of St. Louis in 1977, the Continuing Anglican Movement developed which sought to provide a formal ecclesiastical structure for those who felt unable to remain within mainstream Anglicanism. The larger groupings within the Continuing movement have been increasingly active since the publication by Pope Benedict XVI of the Apostolic Constitution Anglicanorum Coetibus in November 2009. Anglicanorum Coetibus provides a canonical structure for groups of former Anglicans to enter into full communion with the Roman Catholic Church, with formal structures in the form of personal ordinariates now in place in Great Britain, the United States and Australia & Japan The long-term impact of Anglicanorum Coetibus on the Continuing movement is unknown, though there is a clear realisation that the loss of significant groups and their associated resources, especially to the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter in the United States, necessitates the need for discussion and discernment between the ongoing affiliates of the movement.

Common purposes of lift table bellows include: * Protecting the operator from moving parts * Protecting the equipment from debris which could prematurely wear out critical components * Maintaining a sterile clean environment inside of the equipment * Meeting medical standards for patient positioning tables in hospitals Use Industry Industries that commonly use lift tables include: * Woodworking * Manufacturing * Food processing * Automotive industry * Aerospace industry Healthcare They are also used in hospitals and physician's offices. In the United States, in some instances, the U.S. Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that bellows be installed on all moving equipment to protect nearby operators and associates. This varies from state to state and industry.

A right-handed batsman, and leg break bowler, Vigar served as an all-rounder with 8,858 runs at 26.28 and 241 wickets at 37.90. From his rained-off debut in 1938, Vigar went on to play 257 matches for his county. His greatest success came in the \\"golden summer\\" of 1947, where he scored 1,735 runs and took 64 wickets. A partnership with Peter Smith of 218 for the final wicket remains an Essex record. He spent the Second World War serving in the Royal Air Force. As his career progressed, his once useful bowling became both less successful and subordinate to Smith's, though he remained a sound and reliable batsman until a decline in form prompted the end of his playing career in 1954. He made minor county and invitation appearances on occasion up to 1965, and spent three years coaching West of Scotland before retiring. Career Early days Vigar was born on 14 July 1917 in Bruton, Somerset. An \\"ungainly\\" batsman, Vigar developed into a \\"determined middle order\\" player, though he would never been known as a \\"hitter.\\" Trevor Bailey recalled him to be \\"a very unusual mix - a very sound batsman, solid and stubborn, and a useful leg- spinner,\\" while Wisden described him as \\"a tall, Somerset-born leg-spinner who turned into one of Essex's most reliable batsmen in the decade after the war,\\" and \\"tweaked a few.\\" Vigar began his cricketing career as a young amateur, playing for the Essex's Young Amateur team against a similar development squad for Surrey in early September 1935. Vigar scored 30 and took three wickets. Vigar's first match, on 28 May, was rained off after Glamorgan had been dismissed for 100 runs on the first day, and Vigar did not bat or bowl. By 1 June, however, he was contributing to Essex's efforts. That day, Essex faced Worcestershire and was bowled for a duck by Peter Jackson before making 24 not out in the second innings. Worcestershire took the full 12 points following a 60 run victory. He played four more matches that season, amassing a total of 50 runs at 8.33, and taking four wickets at 58.75, including a career-best 2/39 against Derbyshire on 25 August. Regular appearances Vigar became a more regular fixture in the 1939 season, where, from June onwards, he began opening the batting on occasion. Playing in 14 County Championship matches, his return of 282 runs at 20.21 including a maiden century, 121 against Gloucestershire on 8 July. Vigar had originally been promoted up the order as a nightwatchman, however he survived to score his century the next day after the player he had been intended to protect, Jack O'Connor, had been dismissed for a duck. Vigar also took eight wickets during the season at 22.62, composed largely from a 4/20 against Cambridge University on 24 June to take Essex to an innings victory. His other contributions were limited during the season, with single figure scores and only small numbers of overs being bowled, nevertheless Essex reached 4th in the County Championship that year. World War II Vigar's first-class career was then put on hold by the Second World War. Between 26 August 1939 and 11 May 1946 he did not make an appearance for Essex. He did, however, serve in the Royal Air Force, and played several matches for armed services teams between 1941 and 1945, as well as a handful of other matches between the South and the North, and various Essex Second XI outings. The first of these matches, on 12 July 1941, saw Vigar playing for his home county of Somerset's Service team, facing Gloucestershire's Services team in Clifton. Batting at six, he made 49, and then bowled four wicketless overs for 43 and took one catch. The two teams met again on 2 August at Taunton Cricket Ground, where Vigar made one run and did not bowl. One final match on 6 September, where Vigar played for the North against the South, saw him score eight and then take two wickets to take his team to a four wicket victory. Two more matches came during the war years. A British Empire XI faced a choice Essex XI selected by Ray Smith on 22 August 1942, in which there was a place for Vigar. Smith's 12-wicket performance in the match outshone Vigar, who scored four runs and bowled four wicket-less overs. Vigar then played for the West against Glamorgan at Cardiff Arms Park on 18 August 1945, where he scored 37 and two wickets. Breakthrough years Graph showing Vigar's runs per season (red bars) and batting averages (blue). Note his most prolific years, 1946-1947, as well as the decline during the mid-1950s, and the absent years of the Second World War. On 11 May 1946, Vigar returned to county cricket with a County Championship match against Somerset. The next two seasons would be Vigar's breakthrough years. He scored 753 runs at 22.14 in 1946, with a century and three half-centuries, and took 51 wickets at 28.03. His season began strongly, with his three half-centuries on the trot, and then the second century of his career - 101 in the second innings against Northamptonshire on 1 June. In strong form, Vigar then took five-wickets against Yorkshire on 10 July, and then six for 78 against Hampshire on 20 July. He followed this with 8/128 on 10 August against Leicestershire, the 80th best performance by an Essex bowler, beating his previous best of 6/78 by some margin and reaching a landmark of 50 first-class wickets, though he was unable to prevent a draw. Two matches later, on 20 August, he took 8/169 also against Leicestershire. In 1947 Vigar returned a career best 1,735 runs at 35.40, with five centuries and eight half-centuries, and took 64 wickets at 43.48. His run total for 1947 placed him 26th across the country. He began his season on 3 May, with a match against Surrey which had low returns of 23 and one, and no wickets, followed by a knock of 84 against Cambridge University. He was also picking up two to three wickets a match. On 31 May, against Nottinghamshire, he scored 111 and 27 - passing 1,500 first-class runs in the process. A knock of 112 followed on 5 July, against Warwickshire, and two matches later Vigar took 5/68 against Gloucestershire. Vigar reached 100 first-class wickets in the next match with 2/73 against Glamorgan on 16 July, and scored 125 against Hampshire on 23 July. A wicket against Worcestershire on 2 August gave him 50 for the season, and a score of 114 came in the next match against Derbyshire. This five-hour knock, along with Peter Smith's 163, compiled a 218-last-wicket partnership which remains an Essex record. Vigar then took 4/75 and scored 84 against Yorkshire on 27 August, and then ended his season in a combined-team match of Surrey and Kent versus Middlesex and Essex on 6 September - where he scored 145 and 53, and took five wickets in the match. 145 would remain his career best with the bat. 1948-1951 Graph showing Vigar's wickets per season (purple bars) and bowling averages (blue). Note his most prolific years, 1946-1947 - the only occasions where his bowling average was lower than the number of wickets he took - as well as the decline during the mid-1950s, and the absent years of the Second World War. Vigar's batting was not bringing consistent returns, and he narrowly missed out on 1,000 runs in the 1948 season, ending with 964 at 25.36, supported by 27 wickets at 41.48. after a knock of 48 and a four-wicket haul against Glamorgan during the opening match of the season on 8 May against Glamorgan, he faced the touring Australian team - so successful in recent times that it had earned the sobriquet The Invincibles. Vigar and his Essex team mates faced the Australians in Southend-on-Sea on 15 May. Vigar collected two wickets for 66 runs during the Australians only innings, however one over bowled before lunch has subsequently entered Essex Club folklore. Vigar, in \\"an attempt to lure Don Bradman into a rash stroke\\" was brought on to bowl. The first of his \\"barely turning\\" deliveries \\"fizzed straight through and Bradman, who was on strike, calmly patted it back,\\" Vigar was heard to say \\"I've got this fella's measure.\\" He was then, however, hit to the boundary between square-leg and mid-wicket five times by Bradman, who was eventually dismissed by Peter Smith for 187. Australia, reaching 721 thanks to further centuries from Ron Saggers, Bill Brown and Sam Loxton. Vigar picked up a pair - two scores of zero - being dismissed first ball in the first innings and second ball in the second innings, as Essex stumbled to an innings defeat. Vigar resumed his career in the County Championship later that month, meeting Nottinghamshire on 19 May. He scored 37 in the first innings, however failed to take a wicket. More often as his career progressed from the successes of 1946 and 1947, he bowling would become less effective, and less used. Nevertheless, on 5 June against Surrey, he returned 3/127 and 3/40 with the ball. In his next match against Gloucestershire on 9 June, he scored 103 and took four wickets in the match. On 30 June, he dismissed Vic Wilson to pass 150 first-class wickets however it was his only wicket of the match. On 21 July he made 94 against Derbyshire, though he only bowled six overs, and on 7 August he made 70 and 32 to pass 3,500 first-class runs. He narrowly missed out on a second century for the season when he was stumped on 99 against Somerset on 14 August, and ended the season with five wicket-less overs and scores of three and 41 against Northamptonshire on 28 August. Essex came 13th in the County Championship that season, and Vigar continued to struggle with his bowling. From bowling 4,611 deliveries for 2,783 runs in 1947, at 3.6 an over, he bowled only 1,827 balls in 1948, and would never bowl more than 1,763 balls in a season for the remainder of his career, and his bowling average over a season would drop below 37.00 only once more. His bowling was slowly being surpassed by Smith, who consistently recorded better returns, and thus Vigar \\"rarely got the most helpful end.\\" His batting, however, continued to flourish, and he scored 1,000 runs in consecutive seasons across 1949 and 1950. The 1949 season saw 1,449 runs at 33.69, with three centuries and seven half centuries. His bowling returned 28 wickets at 32.46, including one five-wicket-haul. Vigar's season opened with a fixture against the Marylebone Cricket Club on 30 April, where he took one wicket and scored three and one. He made 63 against Middlesex on 14 May, and 136 against Kent on 18 May - passing 4,000 first-class runs when he reached 53. For the next two first-class matches he was not called upon to bowl at all, though against Somerset on 18 June he scored his second century of the season, 119 while batting at number three, to take Essex to a ten- wicket victory. Once again, he was not asked to bowl. He followed this up on 6 July with another hundred, 114 against Leicestershire and 63* in the second innings, to pass 4,500 first-class runs. Vigar then took 3/90 against Northamptonshire on 16 July, and scored 86* against Nottingham, passing 1,000 for the season on 20 July. On 10 August, Essex met a touring New Zealand side, Vigar found success: taking 2/49 and 3/41, as well as scoring 89 and 46 in a drawn match. He also made 87 in the next match, against Sussex, and took three wickets. Vigar then met Somerset on 20 August. He made 24 in Essex's first innings, and then proceeded to take 7/102. Though he could not prevent an innings defeat for Essex, these were his best bowling figures of the season, and second best of his career. Other than a half-century against Lancashire on 24 August, however, he made but single figure scores for the remaining three matches of the season, ending with a fixture against Hampshire where he made two and bowled eight wicket-less overs for 41 runs. Essex began the 1950 County Championship with a ten-wicket defeat against Northamptonshire on 10 May. Vigar scored 65 and 34, though failed to take a wicket. He would go on to make 1,020 runs for the season from his 27 appearances, the second consecutive time he would pass 1,000 runs in a calendar year - the third time in his career overall and also the last. His bowling continued to decline, however: his 1,763 deliveries were the most he would bowl in a season, and his 21 wickets was the best return he would have, for the remainder of his career. Vigar made 86 in the next match on 13 May against Glamorgan, though he only bowled eight overs. Against Surrey on 20 May, though he only scored 13 and 16, they took him passed 5,500 first-class runs, and he took 3/71 and scored 46* against Nottinghamshire on 7 June. His bowling was now being consistently outperformed by Peter Smith's, who since 1947 had enjoyed seasonal wicket returns of 172, 92, 82 and 127 wickets - each higher than Vigar's career best returns. Nevertheless, Vigar took 5/57 to Smith's 4/96 against Sussex on 10 June, and scored 144 against Northamptonshire on 17 June. In the next match, on 21 June against Yorkshire, he took his 200th first-class wicket, Len Hutton, for 156. Vigar then top-scored in an innings of 60 as Essex were dismissed for 158 by Somerset on 28 June, and another half-century of 56 against the same opposition on 5 July took him past 6,000 first-class runs. On 23 August, following a string of low scores and wicketless overs, Vigar and his county faced a touring West Indies side at home. Managing only one in the first innings, he took a catch to dismiss Everton Weekes for 23 but was not called onto bowl. He made 11 in the second innings but could not prevent the tourists from winning by seven wickets. The final County Championship match for Essex quickly followed on 30 August. Vigar made 25, passing 1,000 runs for the season on the only day where play was possible. Essex, however, finished bottom of the Championship table. Essex began the 1951 season with a match against Cambridge University where Vigar scored a duck and did not bowl. He opened his account for the season with 10* and six, and one wicket against the MCC on 9 May. He would go on to score only 553 runs from his 23 matches with a best of 58 however, at an average of 26.33 inflated by eight not outs. He also bowled the fewest deliveries in the season since 1939, taking only eight wickets at 38.75. Against Glamorgan on 16 May he made the first of his three half-centuries for the season, 54*, but again went wicketless while his counterpart Smith took eight wickets. His season-best 58 came on 30 June against Leicestershire, taking him past 6,500 first-class runs, and this was followed two matches later by a knock of 52* against Lancashire on 7 July. He scored 46 and collected three wickets against Sussex on 1 August, took three wickets against Surrey on 8 August, however the remainder of his season was fairly unproductive. He was again outperformed by Smith, who took 87 wickets at 27.74, as Essex reached 8th in the County Championship. As the 1951 season progressed, Vigar also became involved with the Ilford cricket school, the first of its kind in Essex. Along with Trevor Bailey, Sonny Avery and Bill Morris, Vigar assisted Harold Faragher in its development. Final seasons Vigar featured in 31 matches in the 1952 season, the most of his career, and scored 634 runs at 23.48. He made only two centuries, the fewest since 1939, and his average was inflated by 17 not outs, also the most of his career. His bowling also continued to struggle - 19 wickets at 37.63. 1952, however, was also the final season for his rival bowler Peter Smith, who only managed two wickets in one match. Vigar opened his season against Cambridge University, making 41* and bowling 11 unsuccessful overs. On 15 May, he faced TN Pearce's XI - a team that included Smith - and scored 28 and 33. He took 4/90 and 4/69 against Surrey on 21 May; took one wicket during a match against a touring Indian side; and scored 63* and took 2/40 against Leicestershire on 7 June - passing 7,000 first-class runs in the process. A series of low scores followed, until 20 August where he took 2/18 against Middlesex. On the final match of the season, Essex faced Yorkshire on 29 August. Vigar made 10* in the first innings, and 58 in the second as Essex followed on, however this could not prevent Yorkshire taking a ten-wicket win. Vigar struggled further in the 1953 season - taking only four wickets at 55.75, his worst career figures since 1938. His batting was an improvement on the previous season, however, scoring 796 runs at 24.87 from 26 matches, including four half-centuries. He faced Hampshire on 2 May, scoring two and 19* but not being asked to bowl, followed by 37* and 12*. He then made 47 against Middlesex on 16 May, and again on 30 May against Sussex, however he followed this with a pair on 3 June. Opening the batting on 27 June against Kent, he made 77, and took 3/56. He followed this with 52 against Kent at Blackheath on 4 July, and 64 against Leicestershire on 17 July. On 1 August, he faced Worcestershire, and his knock of 15 took him passed 8,000 first-class runs. Against the touring Australian side in the lead up to the 1953 Ashes series, the tourists took victory by an innings and 212 runs, as Essex were routed for 129 and 136 in the face of the oppositions' 477/7 declared. Vigar managed only two in each innings and did not bowl. Vigar regained some form with a score of 42 against Leicestershire on 19 August, then 50 and 39 against Gloucestershire on 26 August. In the final match of the season, against Warwickshire, he managed 19 and 22. Essex came 12th in the County Championship. 1954 was Vigar's final season, and he played 22 matches. He scored 621 runs at 20.03, with three half-centuries, and took seven wickets at 44.14.

A fox farm was established in the village in 1955 and a processing factory for seafood and meat canning was opened in 2009. Culture The area around the village was used as the setting for the film The Chief of Chukotka. The Lorino hot springs are located from the village. The village has a high school, a daycare center, a boarding school, a cultural center, a food store, a hospital, a post-office, and a breeding farm with more than 300 Arctic foxes.

The original structure was built in 1860 making it the oldest freshwater outdoor public swimming baths in the United Kingdom that is still operating. Description The pool The pool is fed by spring water drawn from beneath the baths and is 50 yards long by 25 yards wide (approx 45.7 x 22.9 metres). Facilities include disabled access and toilets, changing rooms, a sun terrace, a large lawn alongside the pool, cold and warm outdoor showers, a small paddling pool and a kiosk selling refreshments. It is open every day in season, which typically runs from early May to late October, and with an autumn season (since 2017). It opened for its 160th consecutive season on Saturday 25 July, with COVID-19 restrictions in place. History The Pells outdoor swimming baths in Lewes is the oldest documented fresh or spring water public pool in the United Kingdom that is still running. The baths were established by public subscription in 1860 and built in 1861, and originally had two pools alongside each other - a subscription bath and a public bath, that was free. The current pool is set within the brick-lined subscription bath, with the lawn alongside it where the free baths were. The land on which they were constructed, the Town Brook, was originally gifted to the townspeople of Lewes in May 1603 by John Rowe, a local lawyer. The original document (with the James I of England wax seal) is in the vaults of the local Town Hall. In the mid-19th century, those in charge of the Borough of Lewes sought to create a public swimming baths, drawing the water, then as now, from the spring water under the land. By public subscription, 442 pounds 5 shillings and 6 pence was raised, and donors included many of the town‚Äôs leading citizens, including both local MPs, Baxters print works, and Harveys and Beards brewers. Those donating ¬£5 or more were given lifetime free admission to the pool, then known as the Lewes Swimming Baths. As recorded in the Lewes Town Book from 1860: ::‚ÄúIt having been a matter of deep regret that the Town of Lewes possessed no public Swimming Baths nor any convenient or safe place for bathing the Constables of the Borough desirous of promoting an object of such public importance invited the Co-operation of their Townsmen in bringing the matter to a practical issue. ::‚ÄúThe \\"Town Brook\\" was selected as the site peculiarly appropriate for the purpose - Meetings were held, plans were drawn and estimates prepared Subscription lists were opened and local committees formed for collecting subscriptions throughout the extended Borough it being also agreed that a Donation of ¬£5 and upwards should entitle the Donor to a permanent free admission to the Baths. ::‚ÄúThe Constables finding that their appeal to their Fellow Townsmen was most liberally responded to, entered into a Contract with Mr. George Harman for the construction of the Baths together with suitable dressing rooms and a Cottage for the residence of an Attendant.‚Äù The work of construction however was delayed that year \\"owing to the extraordinary wet weather interfered with and delayed\\" and completed 1861. The baths opened on Wednesday 29 May 1861: \\"despite a north easterly gales brought into immediate requisition by the public, giving the greatest satisfaction to those who used them\\". With the money raised by subscription two separate baths were built, screened from the Pells millpond by a tall flint wall and elegant brick entrance. People had to pay to use the subscription baths (5 shillings for a season ticket, or 6d for a day), or they could use the larger, shallower public bath alongside free, where people both swam and washed themselves. The new baths thus kept working men from swimming naked in the Pells millpond which they had previously done - and gave local workers a place to wash. The baths were open from 6am to 9pm, allowing working men to bathe before their working day started and after it had finished. They opened for only three hours on Sunday mornings until 9am. Women were allowed to bathe, but they were admitted but at separate times to the subscription baths on two mornings when they were reserved just for women. Men and women bathed separately, and there is no indication that girls under the age of 14 were admitted at all. Over 200 season tickets were sold at 5 shillings (3/6 for boys) and more than 1000 daily admissions at 6d (3d for boys) over the first season. The baths were not always pristine, as a letter to the Sussex Express and County Herald recorded in the 1870s: ‚ÄúThe baths were opened on 1 May this year and have been, owing to recent hot weather, extensively patronised. Yet notwithstanding this they have not been cleaned out or supplied with clean water ... A large portion of the surface is covered with floating scum and underneath the water seems mainly composed of small particles of dust and dirt.‚Äù The Pells area The wider Pells area around the ponds was developed into a kind of Victorian pleasure gardens and constituted the major public grounds in Lewes ‚Äì the Pells recreation ground was created as a walled garden and playground for children in 1897, commemorating Victoria‚Äôs Jubilee. The bath attendant's duties included maintenance of the wider Pells grounds and pond. In very cold winters, the pond and wetlands froze and could be skated on. The water in the swimming baths made a better and smoother skating surface, and it was lowered to allow it to freeze, with tickets sold for 2d at the baths. Records show this continued in the first half of the 20th century, with nearly 100 tickets sold in February 1928. The Pells continued to be used during the Great War, and although the number of season tickets sold was small, daily attendances were high in sunny years. In the 1920s, the Lewes Education Committee paid for an instructor at the baths each year to help children to learn to swim, with the successful swimmers getting a season ticket free for the following year. Swimwear became the norm, and girls swam as well as boys, with both sexes wearing similar one-piece costumes. The pool continued to be popular and improvements were made with changing cubicles (called \\"boxes\\" at the time) being added, new toilets put in and the old oil- powered pumps replaced with electrical pumps in 1928. The records show that the pool made a healthy annual surplus, which was then reinvested periodically in improvements, as well as paying for the annual maintenance costs. The first increase in ticket prices did not take place until 1934, 70 years after the pool opened, when the season ticket prices went up from 5 shillings to 7 shillings and sixpence, and day tickets from threepence to fourpence. Bad flooding in 1937, plus severe frost damage from earlier years, meant significant repairs to the pool were needed, and the bath attendant‚Äôs cottage was condemned in 1938 as unfit for habitation. The Free Bath also fell into disuse as indoor sanitation improved. With the outbreak of the Second World War, large numbers of troops were stationed in the town and the Pells Pool was used for training - for example fireman trained dressed in full kit and carrying equipment to help them prepare for sea or river action. When the war ended, the Borough of Lewes bought the elegant Grange Gardens which lie on the south side of Lewes to create a new public park. They had plans to build a heated indoor swimming pool on the eastern side of the Grange with a car park alongside. The pool and the lake at the Pells would have been turned into playing fields, with the whole area grassed over. Public protests and the lack of public resources meant the plans never materialised. In 1950, the main pool at the Pells was renovated and the disused free pool turned into the lawn which exists today. Prior to the 1950s, the Pool had been surrounded by grass, and the land around would be muddy. And before the filtration system was installed in the late 1950s, the water was green and dark, which made young children learning to swim in the pool sometimes reluctant to enter the water. However, schools around the area continued to use the pool for swimming lessons. Later that decade, sun terraces were added, plus more changing rooms, and the current kiosk built in 1960. So by the time the Pells centenary was celebrated in 1961, the Chairman of the Parks Committee, Anne Dumbrell, could boast that the Pells was ‚Äúone of the most pleasant inland open-air baths in this part of the country.‚Äù The Centenary programme reveals that in 1961, the season ran from 1 May to 30 September and the pool opened weekdays, Saturdays and bank holidays. It was open from 9am-8pm, although it closed for lunch 1pm-2pm. Season tickets cost 20 shillings (¬£1) for adults, 10 shillings for juniors (50p). Day tickets were 1 shilling (5p), and 4d (1.66p) for juniors. Spectators also paid 4d and towels, costumes and caps could be hired. The District Council took over the pool in 1974 as local government reorganisation took effect. In the late 1980s, the Pells was again at risk of closure with the baths due to be sold in 1991 to help finance the building of the new Lewes Leisure Centre, which would give the town its first indoor swimming pool. The District Council suggested that the indoor swimming provided would make the Pells redundant. But there was a public outcry at the proposal with a 4,000 strong petition organised by the Save the Pells Pool Campaign and the discovery that John Rowe's 1603 gifting of the land prevented it being sold for development. Continued vigorous campaigning and well-attended annual town meetings throughout the 1990s kept the pool open. In 1999 a petition was raised with 4,000 signatures against proposals for the pool to be closed and a skateboard park built on the site. As a consequence the District Council ran the pool for a further season with the agreement that a community organisation was formed to operate the pool in the long term. In 2000, the Lewes Town Council took up the trusteeship of the Town Brook trust from the District Council. A charity - the Pells Pool Community Association - was formed and took over the running of the pool on 26 May 2001, nearly 140 years to the day since the Pool opened. The Town Council contributed ¬£10,000 per year for three years, later this budget was extended indefinitely. Page 11.Paraphrased from: Lidos in the UK Investment in the pool has continued through support from the Town Council,http://www.lewes-town.co.uk/infopage.asp?infoid=1040 local sponsors and strong support from the local community, and developments include extensive new pipework, repairs to the pool itself, paving and tiling, disabled toilets, changing rooms and new pumps. One important effect has been to ensure the temperature of the pool is significantly warmer than before ‚Äì since as water was lost each day through cracks in the pool tank, it had to be topped up each day with fresh (and cold) water from the underground spring. The Pells Pool celebrated its 150th Anniversary in 2011. Plans for the future development of the Pells, including an improved paddling pool, redeveloped kiosk, are envisaged, pending planning decisions being made about the redevelopment of the adjoining North Street Quarter. Those plans would place the Pells Pool itself inside the flood defences for the wider area, and allow for physical development of the pool to be undertaken with greater confidence. With the increasing popularity of open water swimming for exercise and health, the pool introduced early morning opening times during weekdays in 2015, returning closer to the original 1860s pattern of morning through to evening opening times. The Pells Pool was announced as a finalist in the category Sussex Visitor Attraction in the Sussex Life magazine awards in October 2015. In the 2017 season, a refurbished paddling pool was opened and the Pells trialled an autumn season, running to mid-October, and it this operated fully in 2018. The 2018 season - starting in early May and finishing in mid October- was thus the longest season at the Pells since before the second world war, and in 2019 this was extended further to opening to the end of October. The Pool hosted its first writer in residence in the 2017 season, and its first artist in residence in 2019. The Pool was due to take part in the planned Pells Centenary in 2020 celebrating the gift of the wider area of Pells land and wetlands to the community in 1920.

Many of the fueling stations include not only conventional gasoline but also ultra-low-sulfur diesel/biodiesel blend, E-85 ethanol fuel blend, compressed natural gas (CNG) and plug-in electric.Department of Fleet Management , City of Chicago. History Prior to 1991, fleet management functions were carried out by individual departments. The Department of Streets and Sanitation (S&S;), Bureau of Equipment Services, was the largest of these fleet management subgroups prior to the establishment of DFM, and was managed by John O'Donnell. Consolidation efforts began in 1987, when Equipment Services functions were moved to the Department of General Services. The intent of this restructuring was to provide fleet management services to other departments. This operation was first headed by Thomas O'Connor, followed by Peter Carroll. In 1991, the need for a dedicated fleet management organization was realized with the creation of DFM. Initially, DFM was given fleet management responsibility for Streets & Sanitation, Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), and several smaller departments, with a total fleet of approximately 3,500 units, and managed by Philip Corbett. In 1993, the Chicago Department of Aviation (CDA) fleet, deployed at the City's O'Hare and Midway Airports and numbering over 1,200 units, was brought under the DFM umbrella. Richard Santella served as Commissioner of Fleet Management from 1994 to 1998, followed by Robert Degnan. The year 2000 brought the addition of the Chicago Fire Department fleet of 140 fire engines, 105 ambulances, and 87 aerial units under Fleet Management's supervision. In 2004, the City's fleet centralization process was accelerated when the Chicago Department of Water Management and Chicago Police Department were added as DFM customer departments. All told, the department now manages a fleet in excess of 13,000 units, servicing nearly 50 entities. The department's annual budget is in excess of $100 million.http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_EDITORIAL/2010BudgetOverviewandRevenueEstimates.pdf, Page 123 DFM also services City \\"sister agencies\\", which maintain separate operating budgets but have relinquished fleet management responsibility in order to reduce operating costs. These agencies include the Chicago Park District, Chicago Housing Authority and the Chicago Transit Authority's non- revenue fleet. The driving force behind the centralizing fleet services is the philosophy of \\"core mission\\", the concept that the resources of each department should be focused on their area of expertise. Simply put, an auto mechanic is not assigned to put out fires, catch criminals, or tend to injured animals, so why should fire fighters, police officers or animal control experts focus on fixing trucks? With Chicago's fleet centralization process complete, all vehicle and equipment specifying, ordering, building, maintaining and fueling operations are now overseen by Fleet Management's 600+ employees. Commissioner Michael J. Picardi was appointed by Mayor Daley to head the Department of Fleet Management in March 2002. For over three years prior to his appointment, he served as the Department's First Deputy Commissioner under Robert Degnan. In May 2005, Commissioner Picardi was selected by Mayor Daley to head the City's largest civilian agency, the Department of Streets and Sanitation. During Picardi's 4 year tenure at Streets and Sanitation, Fleet Management was headed by Howard J. Henneman, who served as Commissioner until his retirement from City employment in June 2009. At that time, Michael Picardi returned to head the Department of Fleet Management for a second time. In January 2010, Mayor Daley suspended Commissioner Picardi for 3 months following a report that a vendor with a criminal history was being used for body repair work on police cars.http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2010/01/daley-suspends- vehicle-commissioner-for-three-months-after-contract-error.html Following Picardi's return from serving his suspension, he was transferred to the Chicago Police Department. Al John Fattore then assumed the role of Acting Commissioner of Fleet Management until January 28, 2011, at which time Mayor Daley named Patrick Harney to run the department.http://mayor.cityofchicago.org/mayor/en/press_room/press_releases/2011/january_2011/0128_harney_fleet.html Harney was confirmed as Fleet Management Commissioner by the Chicago City Council on February 9, 2011. On April 22, 2011, Mayor-elect Rahm Emanuel announced that Fleet Management and General Services functions would once again be merged into a single department.http://www.suntimes.com/4953371-417/rahm-emanuel-to-put-all-city- assets-under-one-department.html David Reynolds was appointed as Commissioner of the combined departments in May 2011. Facilities and Inftrastructure Image:dfm2.jpg|Fleet Management facility at 1685 N. Throop Street A new, purpose built maintenance facility was brought on line in the Fall of 2009. The Western Boulevard Maintenance Facility has been certified as one of only 4 \\"LEED Certified\\" municipal maintenance facilities in the State of Illinois. The dozens of small gas pumps that were once scattered throughout Chicago's police stations, fire houses and maintenance facilities have been replaced by 11 consolidated fueling sites, which dispense diesel fuel (blended with biodiesel), unleaded gasoline, compressed natural gas (CNG), and ethanol. In addition to eliminating environmental issues associated with aging storage tanks, the sites incorporate streamlined fuel delivery and tracking. All fueling transactions are now captured real time, and stored in a database. The data is then analyzed to identify vehicle performance issues or fraudulent fueling activity. The flagship station, located at 65th and State Streets, features solar panels for electricity, stations that supply alternative fuels, and a two-acre natural area that helps manage stormwater runoff. Technological Innovations Upon delivery, all City-owned vehicles are entered into a Vehicle Maintenance and Reporting Tool (VMART) program, a customized version of the \\"M4\\" system developed by Maximus. Pertinent characteristics of each vehicle are captured by the system. This information is available to the office staff, maintenance personnel, and anyone who may need to review it. Data mining software developed by Business Objects is utilized to run detailed reports regarding any aspect of the fleet's vehicle information, fueling logs and maintenance history. Using this software, all information entered into the database can be accessed in myriad combinations. Maintenance operations can also be analyzed to show which trucks are experiencing the most downtime, or which mechanics and shops are the most productive. In addition to the many other services provided to City departments, DFM staffs a 24/7 Fleet Service Center, utilizing an \\"E-Trakker\\" system to manage the repair of downed vehicles.

The teaching of the Catholic Church on ordination, as expressed in the Code of Canon Law, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and the apostolic letter Ordinatio sacerdotalis, is that only a Catholic male validly receives ordination,Codex Iuris Canonici canon 1024, c.f. Catechism of the Catholic Church 1577 and \\"that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful.\\" In other words, the male priesthood is not a policy of the Church but an unalterable requirement of God. As with priests and bishops, the church ordains only men as deacons.Catechism Compendium, Q. 333 The church cannot ordain anyone who has undergone sex reassignment surgery, and may sanction or require therapy for priests who are transsexual, regarding these to be an indicator of mental instability.  History  Early Church References are made within the earliest Christian communities to the role of women in positions of church leadership. Paul's letter to the Romans, written in the first century, commends Phoebe who is described as \\"deaconess of the church at Cen'chre-ae\\" that she be received \\"in the Lord as befits the saints, and help her in whatever she may require from you, for she has been a helper of many and of myself as well.\\" In the same chapter, Paul greets a number of women prominent within the church as \\"co-workers in Christ Jesus\\", including Priscilla, who hosted a house church with her husband, and Junia, who Paul appears to identify as an Apostle. Bernadette Brooten, \\"Junia... Outstanding Among the Apostles\\" (Romans 16:7), Women Priests: A Catholic Commentary on the Vatican Declaration (Paulist Press, 1977) http://people.brandeis.edu/~brooten/Articles/Junia_Outstanding_among_Apostles.pdf In AD 494, in response to reports that women were serving at the altar in the south of Italy, Pope Gelasius I wrote a letter condemning female participation in the celebration of the Eucharist, arguing that those roles were exclusively reserved for men. \\"We have learned to our annoyance that divine affairs have come to such a lower state that women are encouraged to officiate at sacred altars and to take part in all matters imputed to the offices of the male sex, to which they do not belong.\\" In the church of Santa Prassede in Rome, \\"Theodora Episcopa\\" ‚Äî episcopa being the Latin for \\"bishop\\" but in feminine form ‚Äî appears in an image with two female saints and the Virgin Mary. Ecclesiastical tradition explains that this Theodora was mother of Pope Paschal I, who paid for the church. The use of a title usually reserved for a consecrated Roman bishop could therefore be seen as honorific, rather than suggesting that she herself undertook a leadership role, or it could be a later addition.Ute E. Eisen, Women Officeholders in Early Christianity: Epigraphical and Literary Studies, (2000), p204 The parallel in modern Eastern Christianity is that the wife of a priest is titled \\"Presbytera\\" (Greek) or \\"Matushka\\" (Russian) according to her role as elder or mother of the parish church. Church Fathers Many Church Fathers did not advocate for or permit the ordination of women. Clement of Rome taught that the apostles chose only men to succeed them,New Advent: Clement of Rome's Letter to the Corinthians 44 Our apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that there would be strife on account of the office of the episcopate. For this reason, therefore, inasmuch as they had obtained a perfect fore-knowledge of this, they appointed those [ministers] already mentioned, and afterwards gave instructions, that when these should fall asleep, other approved men should succeed them in their ministry. The First Council of Nicaea, the first ecumenical council, subsequently decreed that deaconesses were not ordained ministers because they did not receive the laying on of hands, were to be considered lay persons.Nicaea Council I, Canon XIX Likewise in the case of their deaconesses, and generally in the case of those who have been enrolled among their clergy,...And we mean by deaconesses such as have assumed the habit, but who, since they have no imposition of hands, are to be numbered only among the laity. Concerning the \\"constant practice of the Church\\", in antiquity the Church Fathers Irenaeus,Irenaeus, Against Heresies 1:13:2 Tertullian,Tertullian, \\"Demurrer Against the Heretics\\" 41:4‚Äì5; \\"Baptism\\" 1; \\"The Veiling of Virgins\\" 9 Hippolytus,Hippolytus, \\"The Apostolic Tradition\\" 11 Epiphanius,Epiphanius, \\"Against Heresies\\" 78:13, 79:3 John Chrysostom,John Chrysostom, \\"The Priesthood\\" 2:2 and AugustineAugustine, \\"Heresies\\" 1:17 all wrote that the priestly ordination of women was impossible. The Council of Laodicea prohibited ordaining women to the Presbyterate, although the meaning of Canon 11 has received very different interpretations as to whether it refers to senior deaconesses or older women presiding over the female portion of the congregation. In the period between the Reformation and the Second Vatican Council, mainstream theologians continued to oppose the priestly ordination of women, appealing to a mixture of scripture, Church tradition and natural law.Some translated extracts from contemporary theological textbooks are given here Even so, mainstream theologians did not dismiss the ordination of women as deacons. Ecumenical councils Ecumenical councils, according to the church, are a part of the universal and extraordinary magisterium, making their canons and decrees infallible insofar as they are about the Catholic faith and morals.CCC 85-90 Canon 19 of the First Council of Nicaea (325 CE) declared deaconesses to be laywomen:Nicaea 1 Canons > Like treatment should be given in the case of their deaconesses, and > generally in the case of those who have been enrolled among their clergy. We > mean by ‚Äòdeaconesses‚Äô those who have assumed the habit, but who, since they > have not had hands laid upon them, are to be numbered only among the laity. Canon 15 of the Council of Chalcedon (451 CE) declared that deaconesses are ordained and must practice celibacy after ordination:Chalcedon canons > No woman under forty years of age is to be ordained a deacon, and then only > after close scrutiny. If after receiving ordination and spending some time > in the ministry she despises God's grace and gets married, such a person is > to be anathematised along with her spouse.  Church teaching  Requirements of holy orders While the church believes Christians have the right to receive the sacraments,CCC 1269 the church does not believe in a right to ordination.CCC 1578 The church believes the sacraments work ex opere operatoCCC 1128 as manifestations of Jesus' actions and words during his life,CCC 1115 and that according to dogma Jesus only chose certain men as apostles.CCC 1577 The church teaches that a woman's impediment to ordination is diriment, of divine law, public, absolute, and permanent because Jesus instituted ordinationCCC 1210 by ordaining the twelve apostles,CCC 1556 since holy orders is a manifestation of Jesus' calling of the apostles.CCC 1575 Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood In 1976, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued the Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood which taught that for doctrinal, theological, and historical reasons, the Church \\"does not consider herself authorized to admit women to priestly ordination\\". Reasons given were the Church's determination to remain faithful to its constant tradition, its fidelity to Christ's will, and the iconic value of male representation due to the \\"sacramental nature\\" of the priesthood. The Church teaching on the restriction of its ordination to men is that masculinity was integral to the personhood of both Jesus and the men he called as apostles.Inter Insigniores section 5 The Church sees maleness and femaleness as two different ways of expressing common humanity (essence).Catechism of the Catholic Church 355, 383, 369‚Äì72, 1605, 2333. Ordinatio sacerdotalis On May 22, 1994, John Paul II promulgated Ordinatio sacerdotalis, where he states that the Church cannot confer priestly ordination on women: Pope John Paul II explains the Catholic understanding that the priesthood is a role specially set out by Jesus when he called twelve men out of his group of male and female followers. John Paul says that Jesus chose the Twelve after a night in prayer and that the Apostles themselves were careful in the choice of their successors. The priesthood is \\"specifically and intimately associated in the mission of the Incarnate Word himselfOrdinatio sacerdotalis, #2 Pope Paul VI, quoted by John Paul in Ordinatio sacerdotalis, wrote, \\"The Church holds that it is not admissible to ordain women to the priesthood, for very fundamental reasons. These reasons include: the example recorded in the Sacred Scriptures of Christ choosing his Apostles only from among men; the constant practice of the Church, which has imitated Christ in choosing only men; and her living teaching authority which has consistently held that the exclusion of women from the priesthood is in accordance with God's plan for his Church.\\" Response of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith On Oct 28, 1995, in response to a dubium concerning Ordinatio sacerdotalis, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said: :Dubium: Whether the teaching that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women, which is presented in the Apostolic Letter Ordinatio sacerdotalis to be held definitively, is to be understood as belonging to the deposit of faith. :Responsum: Affirmative. This teaching requires definitive assent, since, founded on the written Word of God, and from the beginning constantly preserved and applied in the Tradition of the Church, it has been set forth infallibly by the ordinary and universal Magisterium (cf. Second Vatican Council, Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen Gentium 25, 2). Thus, in the present circumstances, the Roman Pontiff, exercising his proper office of confirming the brethren (cf. Lk 22:32), has handed on this same teaching by a formal declaration, explicitly stating what is to be held always, everywhere, and by all, as belonging to the deposit of the faith.RESPONSUM AD PROPOSITUM DUBIUM CONCERNING THE TEACHING CONTAINED IN \\"ORDINATIO SACERDOTALIS\\" Doctrinal Commentary on Ad tuendam fidem On July 15, 1998 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a doctrinal commentary on Ad tuendam fidem. In it, the Congregation gave examples of Catholic doctrines owed the full assent of faith, including the reservation of ordination to men only: Decree on the Attempted Ordination of Some Catholic Women On December 2, 2002, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued the Decree on the Attempted Ordination of Some Catholic Women. In it, the Congregation states that the doctrine of ordination was definitively proposed by John Paul II in Ordinatio sacerdotalis: The Congregation further stated that to deny the dogma is to oppose the magisterium of the Pope: Catechism The Catechism of the Catholic Church, promulgated by John Paul II on August 15, 1997,John Paul II, Fidei Depositum 3 The Catechism of the Catholic Church, which I approved 25 June last and the publication of which I today order by virtue of my Apostolic Authority, is a statement of the Church's faith and of catholic doctrine, attested to or illumined by Sacred Scripture, the Apostolic Tradition and the Church's Magisterium. states that the church is bound by Jesus' choice of apostles: 2008 excommunication order The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued and published on May 29, 2008, in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, a decree signed by Cardinal William Levada, by determining that women \\"priests\\" and the bishops who attempt to ordain them would incur excommunication latae sententiae. Pope Francis Pope Francis said \\"that door is closed\\" regarding women's priestly ordination, affirming the teachings of his predecessors, including St. Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. He expanded on this in a November 2016 informal statement on the return flight from his papal visit to Sweden to commemorate the Reformation: \\"On the ordination of women in the Catholic Church, the final word is clear, it was said by St. John Paul II and this remains.\\" Francis added that women are very important to the Church, specifically from a \\"Marian dimension. In Catholic ecclesiology there are two dimensions to think about... The Petrine dimension, which is from the Apostle Peter, and the Apostolic College, which is the pastoral activity of the bishops, as well as the Marian dimension, which is the feminine dimension of the Church.\\" The Church is depicted as the bride of Christ, as a woman. Ordination to the diaconate  In contrast to the ordination of women to the Catholic priesthood, the ordination of women to the diaconate is being actively discussed by Catholic scholars, and theologians, as well as senior clergy. The historical evidence points to women serving in ordained roles from its earliest days in both the Western Church as well as the Eastern Church.Roger Gryson, The Ministry of Women in the Early Church, Collegeville, MN, Liturgical Press, 1976. Although writers such Martimort contends they did not.Aime Georges Martimort, Deaconesses: An Historical Study, translated by K. D. Whitehead, San Francisco, Ignatius Press, 1986. Monastic female deacons in the East received the stole as a symbol of their office at ordination, which took place inside the sanctuary. The First Council of Nicaea (325) stated that deaconesses of heretical sects \\"do not receive any imposition of hands, so that they are in all respects to be numbered among the laity.\\"Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils First Council of Nicaea, canon 19 The later Council of Chalcedon (451) decreed \\"A woman shall not receive the laying on of hands as a deaconess under forty years of age, and then only after searching examination.\\" Gryson argues that the use of the verb cheirotonein and of the substantive cheirothesia clearly indicate that women deacons were ordained by the laying on of hands.The Canonical Implications of Ordaining Women to the Permanent Diaconate, Canon Law Society of America, 1995, p. 19. Women ceased to function as deacons in the West in the 13th century. In the past century, K. K. Fitzgerald, Phyllis Zagano, and Gary Macy have argued for the sacramental ordination of women as deacons. A significant contribution on this aspect was made Jean Dani√©lou, in an article in La Maison-Dieu in 1960. The Second Vatican Council in the 1960s revived the permanent diaconate, raising the question of female engagement from a purely theoretical matter to one with practical consequences.The Canonical Implications of Ordaining Women to the Permanent Diaconate, Canon Law Society of America, 1995. Based on the idea that women deacons received and are capable of receiving the sacrament of Holy Orders, there have been continued modern-day proposals to ordain permanent women deacons, who would perform the same functions as male deacons and be like them in every respect. In 1975 the German Roman Catholic Episcopal Synod in W√ºrzburg voted in favour of ordaining women deacons.Domradio.de:\\"Wir erleben das noch\\", Diskussion um die Frauenordination, 31. M√§rz 2017 The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome indicated it was open to the idea and ruled in 1977 that the possibility of ordaining women as deacons was \\"a question that must be taken up fully by direct study of the texts, without preconceived ideas.\\" The International Theological Commission looked at the issue in the 1990s and its report was approved for publication by Joseph Ratzinger, where it indicated that the matter is one for the Magisterium to decide. In 2015, Archbishop Jean-Paul Durocher, of Gatineau, Canada, called for the restoration of women to the diaconate at the Synod of Bishops on the Family. In 2016, Pope Francis formerly established a Commission to study the ministry of deaconesses in the early church, exploring their roles, the rites they participated in, and the formulas employed to designate them as deaconesses. The \\"Pontifical Commission for the Study of the Diaconate of Women\\" included twelve scholars under the presidency of Cardinal Luis Ladaria Ferrer. The first meetings were held in Rome. In 2018 Pope Francis indicated that there had been as yet no conclusive decisions, but that he was not afraid of ongoing studies. Finally in January 2019, two of its members confirmed that a report had been formally submitted. In October 2019, Members of the Synod of Bishops for the Amazon asked that women be given leadership roles in the Catholic Church, although they stopped short of calling for female deacons.Angelusnews.com:, but there were many bishops also, who voted by 137 to 30 Katholisch.de: Amazonassynode (German), October 27, 2019 in favour of female deacons.Katholisch.de: Viele Bisch√∂fe f√ºr verheiratete Priester und Frauendiakone (German), October 18, 2019 In February 2020, Pope Francis seemed to reject the possibility of ordaining women deacons in the immediate term. However, in April he initiated a new ten- person commission to consider the issue in terms of practice. Ordination and equality  The Roman Catholic Church states that the hierarchical structure of the ordained ministerial priesthood is ordered to service for all of the baptized faithful.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church\\" 1120 In Mulieris dignitatem, Pope John Paul II advocated for Christian complementarianism, writing: \\"In calling only men as his Apostles, Christ acted in a completely free and sovereign manner. In doing so, he exercised the same freedom with which, in all his behavior, he emphasized the dignity and the vocation of women, without conforming to the prevailing customs and to the traditions sanctioned by the legislation of the time.\\"Pope John Paul II, Mulieris Dignitatem 26 In calling only men as his Apostles, Christ acted in a completely free and sovereign manner. In Ordinatio sacerdotalis, John Paul II wrote: \\"the fact that the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Mother of the Church, received neither the mission proper to the Apostles nor the ministerial priesthood clearly shows that the non-admission of women to priestly ordination cannot mean that women are of lesser dignity, nor can it be construed as discrimination against them. Rather, it is to be seen as the faithful observance of a plan to be ascribed to the wisdom of the Lord of the universe.\\"Pope John Paul II, Ordinatio Sacreditalis 3 Furthermore, the fact that the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Mother of the Church, received neither the mission proper to the Apostles nor the ministerial priesthood clearly shows that the non-admission of women to priestly ordination cannot mean that women are of lesser dignity, nor can it be construed as discrimination against them. Rather, it is to be seen as the faithful observance of a plan to be ascribed to the wisdom of the Lord of the universe. The Roman Catholic Church does not regard the priest as the only possible prayer leader, and prayer may be led by a woman. For example, when no priest, deacon, instituted lector or instituted acolyte is available, lay people (either men and women) may be appointed by the pastor to celebrate a Liturgy of the Word and distribute Holy Communion (which must be consecrated beforehand by a priest). During these liturgies, a layperson is to act as \\"one among equals\\" and avoid formulas or rites which are proper to ordained ministers. Religious life is a distinct vocation in itself, and women live in consecrated life as a nun or religious sister, and throughout the history of the Church it has not been uncommon for an abbess to head a dual monastery, i.e., a community of men and women. Women today exercise many roles in the Church. They run catechetical programs in parishes, provide spiritual direction, serve as lectors and extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, and teach theology. In 1994, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments interpreted the 1983 Code of Canon Law to permit girls and women to assist at Mass as altar servers. Still many people see the Church's position on the ordination of women as a sign that women are not equal to men in the Catholic Church, though the Church rejects this inference.Rausch, Thomas P. Catholicism in the Third Millennium. Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 2003.  Dissenting views  There is a controversial suggestion that the mother of Pope Paschal I, the Lady Theodora, was a Bishop in the Catholic Church.Ute E. Eisen, Women Officeholders in Early Christianity: Epigraphical and Literary Studies, (2000), p204 Since 2002 Roman Catholic Womenpriests has conducted ordination ceremonies for women to become deacons, priests and bishops, saying that these ordinations are valid because the initial ordinations were conferred by a validly ordained Catholic male bishop (Romulo Antonio Braschi, who left the Roman Catholic Church in 1975) and therefore they are in the line of apostolic succession. However, the Catholic Church considers these ordinations to be invalid, and decreed excommunications for those involved in the ceremonies. Roman Catholic Womenpriests interprets the works of certain Catholic scholars (for example, former minister John Wijngaards, liturgical reformist Robert W. Hovda, and theologian Damien Casey), to say that they have doctrinal support for the ordination of women. Women's Ordination Worldwide, founded in 1996 in Austria, is a network of twelve national and international groups whose primary mission is the admission of Roman Catholic women to all ordained ministries. Members include Catholic Women's Ordination (founded in March 1993 in the United Kingdom), Roman Catholic Womenpriests (founded in 2002 in America), Women's Ordination Conference (founded in 1975 in America) and others. The first recorded Catholic organization advocating for women's ordination was St. Joan's Alliance, founded in 1911 in London. In February 2011, 144 German- speaking academic theologians (making up one-third of the Catholic theology professors in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) submitted a document styled as Church 2011 calling for a list of concessions including \\"women in (the) ordained ministry.\\" Memorandum:Church 2011 In 2014 the Bishop of Basel, Felix Gm√ºr, allowed the Basel Catholic church corporations, which are officially only responsible for church finances, to formulate an initiative appealing for equality between men and women in ordination to the priesthood. Also in 2014, the Association of Catholic Priests in Ireland stated that the Catholic Church must ordain women and allow priests to marry in order to survive. Other dissenters on the subject of women's ordination are the Austrian-based Call to Disobedience, also as of 2013 a minority in the American \\"Association of U.S. Catholic Priests\\" favor ordaining women as priests, and the majority of that organisation favour allowing woman deacons. The Pontifical Biblical Commission studied the matter in 1976, and found nothing in Sacred Scripture that specifically barred women from accession to the priesthood. Catholic women religious were major participants in the first and second meetings of the Women's Ordination Conference. In 1979, Sister Theresa Kane, then the president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, spoke from the podium at Washington, DC's Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, and asked Pope John Paul II to include women \\"in all ministries of our Church.\\" In the audience were fewer than fifty sisters wearing blue armbands, symbolizing women's ordination. When Pew Research polled Americans in 2015, 59 percent of those who self-identified as Catholic believed that the church should ordain women.In Defiance Of The Church, Some Catholic Women Seek Priesthood NPR, Sept 16, 2015 However these included people who did not self identify as practising. A \\"History of the women's ordination movement in the U.S. Roman Catholic church\\" was published in 2015.Daigler, Mary Jeremy. 2015. Incompatible with God's design: History of the women's ordination movement in the U.S. Roman Catholic church. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield. There is at least one organization that, without Church authority, calls itself \\"Roman Catholic\\" that ordains women as priests at the present time, Roman Catholic Womenpriests; and several independent Catholic jurisdictions have been ordaining women in the United States since approximately the late 1990s. These organizations are independent of, and unrecognised by, the Roman Catholic Church. There are several others calling for the Roman Catholic Church itself to ordain women, such as St. Joan's International Alliance, Circles, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, Catholic Women's Ordination, and Corpus, along with others. On April 19, 2009, Womenpriests elected four bishops to serve the United States: Joan Mary Clark Houk, Andrea Michele Johnson, Maria Regina Nicolosi, and Bridget Mary Meehan. The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had issued a decree in 2008 declaring such \\"attempted ordinations\\" invalid and that, since Canons 1378 and 1443 apply to those who participate in these ceremonies, all were excommunicated. Edward Peters, a doctor of canon law, explains that their excommunication results in virtue of a combination of other canons which arise from application of Canons 1378 and 1443. In response, Womenpriests said its members are \\"loyal member of the church who stand in the prophetic tradition of holy disobedience to an unjust law.\\"editors, \\"In the Beginning,\\" National Catholic Reporter May 1, 2009, 4.

Several tournaments were organized and the Hand-pelota, remonte and pala championships were introduced for the first professional pelotaris.

The process and ceremonies of ordination varies by denomination. One who is in preparation for, or who is undergoing the process of ordination is sometimes called an ordinand. The liturgy used at an ordination is sometimes referred to as an ordinal. Ordination of women has been taking place in an increasing number of Protestant churches during the 20th century. While ordination of women has been approved in many denominations over the past half century, it is still a very controversial and divisive topic. Overview of the theological debate Most (although not all) Protestant denominations ordain church leaders who have the task of equipping all believers in their Christian service (). These leaders (variously styled elders, pastors, or ministers) are seen to have a distinct role in teaching, pastoral leadership. Protestant churches have historically viewed the Bible as the ultimate authority in church debates (the doctrine of sola scriptura), as such the debate over women's eligibility for such offices normally centers around interpretation of certain Biblical passages relating to teaching and leadership roles. The main passages in this debate include , and , , Increasingly however, supporters of women in ministry argue that the Biblical passages used to argue against women's ordination might be read differently when more understanding of the unique historical context of each passage is available. They further argue that the New Testament shows that women did exercise certain ministries in the apostolic Church (e.g., , , , ; , , and . Often quoting ,they argue that the good news brought by Jesus has broken down all barriers and that female ordination is an equality issue that Jesus would have approved of. They also quote , and argue that in talking to Mary, Jesus is calling for women to evangelize In turn, those who argue for a male only ministry will say that the claims to contexts that change the apparent meaning of the texts at hand to one supporting female ordination are in fact spurious, that the passages that appear to show women in positions of authority do not in fact do so and the idea that the good news of Jesus brings equality before God only relates to salvation and not to roles for ministry.

However, several provinces (such as the Church of Pakistan‚Äîa united Protestant Church created as a result of a union between Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Presbyterians) and certain dioceses within otherwise ordaining provinces (such as the Diocese of Sydney in the Anglican Church of Australia), continue to ordain only men. Disputes over the ordination of women have contributed to the establishment and growth of conservative separatist tendencies, such the Anglican realignment and Continuing Anglican movements. Some provinces within the Anglican Communion, such as the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, ordain women to the three traditional holy orders of bishop, priest and deacon. Other provinces ordain women as deacons and priests but not as bishops; others still as deacons only; and seven provinces do not approve the ordination of women to any order of ministry.  Baptist  The very diverse organizations which employ the term Baptist in self-designation: * The Baptist organizations in Germany and Switzerland (Bund Evangelisch-Freikirchlicher Gemeinden, Bund Schweizer Baptistengemeinden) ordain women. * The Southern Baptist Convention (the largest of the various Baptist denominations) does not support the ordination of women; however, some churches that are members of the SBC have ordained women. Though each SBC church is autonomous and may choose whether or not to ordain women, the local associations and state conventions have the right to not seat messengers from those churches at the annual meetings, and some have done so. * Baptist groups in the United States that ordain women include American Baptist Churches USA, North American Baptist Conference, Alliance of Baptists, Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (CBF), Missionary Baptist Conference, USA, National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. and Progressive National Baptist Convention.Glenn T.

In 1953, Reverend Lydia Emelie Gruchy was the first Canadian woman to receive an honorary Doctor of Divinity.  Australia  * The Uniting Church in Australia has ordained women since it formed in 1977. The three member denominations, the Congregational Union of Australia, the Methodist Church of Australasia and the Presbyterian Church of Australia had all ordained women prior to Union. The Congregational Union of Australia ordained the first woman in Christian ministry in Australia, Rev Winifred Kiek in 1927. The Methodist Church of Australasia first ordained women (Rev Margaret Sanders and Rev Coralie Ling) in 1969, while the Presbyterian Church of Australia ordained its first woman minister in 1974. After formation of the Uniting Church in Australia, the continuing Presbyterian Church of Australia reversed the decision to ordain women in 1991. * The Presbyterian Church of Australia does not ordain women. As mentioned above some of its congregations left to join the new Uniting Church in 1977, 14 years later in 1991 it ceased ordaining women to the ministry, but the rights of women ordained prior to this time were not affected.Scheme of Union of the Presbyterian Church of Australia.  Pakistan  * The Presbyterian Church of Pakistan ordains women.

See Elizabeth Hooton and Mary Fisher though it was longer before they held positions as clerk of a yearly meeting (e.g., Mary Jane Godlee as first female clerk of the London Yearly Meeting in 1921) though they were clerks of the then separate women's meetings which did wield authority. * 'Christian Connection Church: An early relative of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the United Church of Christ, this body ordained women as early as 1810. Among them were Nancy Gove Cram, who worked as a missionary with the Oneida Indians by 1812, and Abigail Roberts (a lay preacher and missionary), who helped establish many churches in New Jersey. Others included Ann Rexford, Sarah Hedges and Sally Thompson. * The Christian and Missionary Alliance in the USA does not ordain women, but it does in other nations.

These ordinations are considered irregular and are not officially recognized in the church yearbook. In some parts of the world the Adventist Church, commissions women instead of ordaining. They can perform almost the same duties as an ordained minister but do not hold the title of ordained. This is because recent votes at the worldwide General Conference Sessions turned down a proposal to allow ordination of women. There was a strong polarization between nations, with Western countries and North Asia Pacific generally voting in support and other countries generally voting against. A further proposal to allow local choice was also turned down. In practice, there are numerous women working as ministers and in leadership positions.

Currently, it is necessary to convert data between CAD and FEA packages to analyse new designs during development, a difficult task since the two computational geometric approaches are different. Isogeometric analysis employs complex NURBS geometry (the basis of most CAD packages) in the FEA application directly. This allows models to be designed, tested and adjusted in one go, using a common data set. The pioneers of this technique are Tom Hughes and his group at The University of Texas at Austin. A reference free software implementation of some isogeometric analysis methods is GeoPDEs. Likewise, other implementations can be found online. For instance, PetIGA is an open framework for high performance isogeometric analysis heavily based on PETSc. In addition, MIGFEM is another IGA code which is implemented in Matlab and supports Partition of Unity enrichment IGA for 2D and 3D fracture. Furthermore, G+Smo is an open C++ library for isogeometric analysis. In particular, FEAP is a finite element analysis program which includes an Isogeometric analysis library FEAP IsoGeometric (Version FEAP84 & Version FEAP85). An account of the developments leading up to IGA has been documented in . Advantages of IGA with respect to FEA Isogeometric analysis presents two main advantages with respect to the finite element method: *There is no geometric approximation error, due to the fact the domain is represented exactly *Wave propagation problems, arising for instance in cardiac electrophysiology, acoustics and elastodynamics, are better described, thanks to the reduction of numerical dispersion and dissipation errors. Meshes In the framework of IGA, the notions of both control mesh and physical mesh are defined. A control mesh is made by the so called control points and it is obtained by a piecewise linear interpolation of them. Control points play also the role of degrees of freedom (DOFs). The physical mesh lays directly on the geometry and it consists of patches and knot spans. According to the number of patches that are used in a specific physical mesh, a single-patch or a multi- patch approach is effectively employed. A patch is mapped from a reference rectangle in two dimensions and from a reference cuboid in three dimensions: it can be seen as the entire computational domain or a smaller portion of it. Each patch can be decomposed into knot spans, which are points, lines and surfaces in 1D, 2D and 3D, respectively. Knots are inserted inside knot spans and define the elements. Basis functions are C^{p-m} across the knots, with p degree of the polynomial and m multiplicity of a specific knot, and C^{\\\\infty} between a certain knot and the next or preceding one. Knot vector A knot vector, normally indicated as \\\\Xi = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, ..., \\\\xi_{n+p+1} \\\\\\\\}, is a set of non-descending points. \\\\xi_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} is the i^{th} knot, n is the number of functions, p refers to the basis functions order. A knot divides the knot span into elements. A knot vector is uniform or non-uniform according to the fact that its knots, once their multiplicity is not taken into account, are equidistant or not. If the first and the last knots appear p + 1 times, the knot vector is said to be open. Basis functions Once a definition of knot vector is provided, several types of basis functions can be introduced in this context, such as B-splines, NURBS and T-splines. B-splines B-splines can be derived recursively from a piecewise constant function with p = 0: N_{i, 0}(\\\\xi) = \\\\mathcal{I}_{[\\\\xi_i, \\\\xi_{i+1})}(s) \\\\quad 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n Using De Boor's algorithm, it is possible to generate B-splines of arbitrary order p: N_{i, p}(\\\\xi) = \\\\frac{\\\\xi - \\\\xi_i}{\\\\xi_{i+p} - \\\\xi_i} N_{i, p - 1}(\\\\xi) + \\\\frac{\\\\xi_{i+p+1} - \\\\xi}{\\\\xi_{i+p+1} - \\\\xi_{i+1}} N_{i + 1, p - 1}(\\\\xi) \\\\quad 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n valid for both uniform and non-uniform knot vectors. For the previous formula to work properly, let the division of two zeros to be equal to zero, i.e. \\\\dfrac{0}{0} := 0. B-splines that are generated in this way own both the partition of unity and positivity properties, i.e: \\\\sum_{i=1}^n N_{i, p}(\\\\xi) = 1 \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\xi N_{i, p}(\\\\xi) \\\\geq 0 \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\xi So as to calculate derivatives or order k of the i^{th} B-splines of degree p, another recursive formula can be employed: \\\\frac{d^k}{d^k \\\\xi} N_{i, p}(\\\\xi)= \\\\frac{p!}{(p-k)!} \\\\sum_{j=0}^k \\\\alpha_{k, j} N_{i + j, p - k}(\\\\xi) where: \\\\alpha_{0, 0} = 1 \\\\alpha_{k, 0} = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{k - 1, 0}}{\\\\xi_{i + p - k + 1} - \\\\xi_{i}}, \\\\alpha_{k, j} = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{k - 1, j} - \\\\alpha_{k - 1, j - 1}}{\\\\xi_{i + p + j - k + 1} - \\\\xi_{i + j}} \\\\quad j = 1, ..., k-1, \\\\alpha_{k, k} = \\\\frac{- \\\\alpha_{k - 1, j - 1}}{\\\\xi_{i + p + 1} - \\\\xi_{i + k}}. whenever the denominator of an \\\\alpha_{j, j} coefficient is zero, the entire coefficient is forced to be zero as well. A B-spline curve can be written in the following way: \\\\textbf{C}(\\\\xi) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n N_{i, p}(\\\\xi) \\\\textbf{B}_i where n is the number of basis functions N_{i, p}, and \\\\textbf{B}_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d is the i^{th} control point, with d dimension of the space in which the curve is immersed. An extension to the two dimensional case can be easily obtained from B-splines curves. In particular B-spline surfaces are introduced as: \\\\textbf{S}(\\\\xi, \\\\eta) = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\\\sum_{j = 1}^m N_{i, p}(\\\\xi) M_{j, q}(\\\\eta) \\\\textbf{B}_{i, j} where n and m are the numbers of basis functions N_{i, p} and M_{j, q} defined on two different knot vectors \\\\Xi = \\\\\\\\{\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, ..., \\\\xi_{n+p+1}\\\\\\\\}, \\\\mathcal{H} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\eta_1, \\\\eta_2, ..., \\\\eta_{m+q+1} \\\\\\\\}, \\\\textbf{B}_{i, j} represents now a matrix of control points (also called control net). Finally, B-splines solids, that need three sets of B-splines basis functions and a tensor of control points, can be defined as: \\\\textbf{S}(\\\\xi, \\\\eta, \\\\zeta) = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\\\sum_{j = 1}^m \\\\sum_{k = 1}^l N_{i, p}(\\\\xi) M_{j, q}(\\\\eta) L_{k, r}(\\\\zeta) \\\\textbf{B}_{i, j, k} NURBS In IGA basis functions are also employed to develop the computational domain and not only for representing the numerical solution. For this reason they should have all the properties that permit to represent the geometry in an exact way. B-splines, due to their intrinsic structure, are not able to generate properly circular shapes for instance. In order to circumvent this issue, non-uniform rational B-splines, also known as NURBS, are introduced in the following way: R_i^p(s) = \\\\frac{N_{i, p}(s) \\\\omega_i}{W(s)} where N_{i, p} is a one dimensional B-spline, W(s) = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} N_{i, p}(s) \\\\omega_i is referred to as weighting function, and finally \\\\omega_i is the i^{th} weight. Following the idea developed in the subsection about B-splines, NURBS curve are generated as follows: \\\\textbf{C}(s) = \\\\sum_{i = 1}^n R_i^p(s) \\\\textbf{B}_i with \\\\textbf{B}_i i^{th} vector of control points. The extension of NURBS basis functions to manifolds of higher dimensions (for instance 2 and 3) is given by: R_{i, j}^{p, q}(s, t) = \\\\frac{N_{i, p}(s) M_{j, q}(t) \\\\omega_{i, j}}{\\\\sum_{a = 1}^n \\\\sum_{b = 1}^m N_{a, p}(s) M_{b, q}(t) \\\\omega_{a, b}} R_{i, j, k}^{p, q, r}(s, t, w) = \\\\frac{N_{i, p}(s) M_{j, q}(t) L_{k, r}(w) \\\\omega_{i, j, k}}{\\\\sum_{a = 1}^n \\\\sum_{b = 1}^m \\\\sum_{c = 1}^l N_{a, p}(s) M_{b, q}(t) L_{c, r}(w) \\\\omega_{a, b, c}} hpk-refinements There are three techniques in IGA that permit to enlarge the space of basis functions without touching the geometry and its parametrization. The first one is known as knot insertion (or h-refinement in the FEA framework), where \\\\overline{\\\\Xi} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\overline{\\\\xi_1}=\\\\xi_1, \\\\overline{\\\\xi_2}, ..., \\\\overline{\\\\xi_{n+m+p+1}} = \\\\xi_{n+p+1}\\\\\\\\} is obtained from \\\\Xi = \\\\\\\\{\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2, ..., \\\\xi_{n+p+1}\\\\\\\\} with the addition of more knots, which implies an increment of both the number of basis functions and control points. The second one is called degree elevation (or p-refinement in the FEA context), which permits to increase the polynomial order of the basis functions. Finally the third method, known as k-refinement (without a counterpart in FEA), derives from the preceding two techniques, i.e. combines the order elevation with the insertion of a unique knot in \\\\Xi.

He is the author of four books. Powell is a photographer who specializes in the environmental portrait. Though Powell initially rose to fame because of his relationship with the Beastie Boys, he is now well known for his intimate photographs that have been featured in The New York Times, the New York Post, the Daily News, The Village Voice, TIME, Newsweek, VIBE, The Source, Rolling Stone, and many other publications.  Early life and education  Powell was born and raised in New York City. Powell graduated with an AA in Liberal Arts from LaGuardia Community College and a B.S. in Physical Education from Hunter College. Career Powell originally saw photography as a hobby; taking pictures of family and friends at random. But in 1985, when a girlfriend ‚Äúplayed [Powell] like a soggy cannoli‚Äù, as he described in an interview with The New Yorker, he took the camera she had left at his place and vowed that ‚ÄúShe would be mad sorry she dissed [him] like this‚Äù. Beastie Boys In 1986, Powell ditched his job selling lemon ices out of a street car to tag along with the Beastie Boys on Run-DMC's Raising Hell tour. Some of the photographs that he took while on tour became significant, and Powell gained notoriety, becoming the unofficial ‚Äúfourth Beastie Boy‚Äù. He toured with the group as Def Jam Records‚Äô de facto in-house photographer on their Licensed to Ill tour in 1987 and Together Forever: Greatest Hits 1983‚Äì1991 tour with Run DMC and then again in 1992 on their Check Your Head tour and the 1994 Lollapalooza.Denver, Nate. \\"Access Granted.\\" Mass Appeal, Issue 35: 63-66.

Biography Family background Roger Neville was born in St. Pancras, London, the son of John Ernest Gartside Neville, a stockbroker, and his wife Jane (n√©e Gartside). His grandfather was the actor and theatrical manager Henry Gartside Neville. First World War After attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, as a \\"gentlemen cadet\\", Neville was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry on 14 July 1915. He was soon seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, and appointed a flying officer on 18 November. He joined No. 21 Squadron in early 1916, to fly a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12 single-seat bomber.Shores et.al. (1990), p.290. On 21 July 1916 he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. Neville scored his first aerial victory on 14 September 1916, destroying a German LVG two-seater reconnaissance aircraft south-west of V√©lu. Eight days later, he was wounded in action. In November he was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read: :Second Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) Roger Henry Gartside Neville, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous skill and gallantry. He is a fine leader of patrol work, and has done much to keep enemy machines away from our lines. On one occasion, flying in a rainstorm, after nearly colliding with an enemy machines he pursued it and brought it down half a mile from an enemy aerodrome.\\" Neville returned to duty, assigned to No. 23 Squadron, to fly a Spad VII single-seat fighter. He received a regimental promotion, to lieutenant in the DCLI on 1 July 1917. He gained a double aerial victory on 6 July 1917, destroying and driving down out of control two Albatros D.Vs over Tourcoing, and on 11 July he drove down another D.V out of control over Westrozebeke. His fifth and final victory came on 27 July, when he and Second Lieutenant Frederick J. Gibbs shared in the destruction of an Aviatik C over Kezelberg. Postwar career Neville remained seconded to the RAF after the end of the war, and his period of service was extended for two years on 1 August 1919, again on 1 August 1921, and for a third time on 1 August 1923, by which time he held the rank of flight lieutenant. Neville was eventually granted a permanent commission in the RAF on 5 March 1924, and was promoted to squadron leader on 1 July. On 12 August he was appointed commanding officer of No. 29 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Duxford, and the following year lead his squadron in the 1925 Air Defence Manoeuvres, as part of the defending forces of \\"Westland\\" against the attackers from \\"Eastland\\". On 3 July 1926 he took part in an exhibition of close formation flying by nine aircraft from six fighter squadrons ‚Äî 54 in all ‚Äî as part of the seventh RAF Aerial Pageant at Hendon Aerodrome, at which time No. 29 Squadron were flying Gloster Grebes. On 2 September 1927 he took command of No. 60 Squadron RAF, based in India. On 26 June 1931 he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division) \\"for valuable services in connection with the operations on the North-West Frontier of India between 23 April and 12 September 1930\\". On 1 July 1932 he was promoted to wing commander, and on 19 July took command of the RAF School of Photography at South Farnborough. He then served as Station Commander of RAF North Weald until 14 December 1933, when he was appointed a staff officer at the Headquarters of the Central Area, Air Defence of Great Britain, at RAF Abingdon. On 27 August 1936 he was posted to the Headquarters of the Armament Group at RAF Eastchurch. Neville was promoted to group captain on 1 July 1937. Neville served in the RAF throughout the Second World War, receiving a mention in despatches on 1 January 1946. Personal life Neville married Marion Aldyth Chorlton (1899‚Äì1942), of Prestwich, on 2 April 1918. They had one son, Christopher Roger Gartside Neville (1924‚Äì1998), who joined the RAF in 1944, and served until 1979, retiring with the rank of Air Commodore. After his first wife's death he married Joyce E. Oulton at Hove, Sussex, in December 1943.

He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a football scholarship as a wide receiver. However, Clark was a walk-on to the baseball team, and in three seasons posted a career batting average of .366 with 21 home runs, 137 RBI, and 49 stolen bases. Clark was be drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 20th round of the MLB Draft following his sophomore season, but returned for his junior year. Following that season, he was picked in the 7th round of the 1998 MLB draft by the San Francisco Giants. Professional career San Francisco Giants Clark signed with the Giants in 1998 and was assigned to the Single A Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Northwest League. He spent the majority of the 1999 season at Single A Bakersfield and had a successful stint with them, batting .326 with 11 home runs, 58 RBI and 17 stolen bases. He also played 15 games with the Double A Shreveport Captains. Clark spent the entire 2000 and 2001 seasons in Shreveport. He enjoyed two fairly successful seasons, hitting .272 with 10 home runs and 75 RBI in 2000, and .275 with 6 home runs, 51 RBI and 20 stolen bases in 2001. In 2002 Clark started the season again with the Double A Shreveport Captains before being called up to the Triple A Fresno Grizzlies. However, he also spent 2003 between Double A and Triple A, this time with a new Double A affiliate of the Giants, the Norwich Navigators. Clark played the entire 2004 season in Norwich, batting .292 with 4 home runs and 49 RBI. Clark started the 2005 season with the Triple A Fresno Grizzlies. He played in 127 games with the Grizzlies batting .316 with 13 home runs and 59 RBI. On September 14, 2005 Clark made his major league debut with the Giants. Clark appeared in 8 games with San Francisco mainly as a pinch hitter or runner or defensive replacement. He did not record a hit but scored two runs. Oakland Athletics At the end of the season he was granted free agency by the Giants and was quickly signed to a free agent contract by the Oakland A's Clark started the 2006 season with the Triple A Sacramento River Cats but was called up to the A's and made his first appearance with them on June 20, 2006. Clark appeared in 6 games as a pinch hitter and recorded his first major league hit. He was then recalled to Sacramento where he finished the season hitting .287 with 15 home runs and 67 RBI. Atlanta Braves At the end of the 2006 season Clark was again granted free agency and was signed by the Atlanta Braves. He attempted to make the major league roster in spring training, although he batted .429 in spring training he failed to secure a roster spot and was sent to the Triple A Richmond Braves. Clark played in 134 games with Richmond and hit .275 with 15 home runs and 69 RBI. At the end of the 2007 season Clark was released by the Braves. However, during the 2007 season prior to a game in Richmond, Clark had been introduced to a Korean scout who was in attendance and stated that he liked the way that Clark played.http://www.umassathletics.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/020110aaa.html Hanwha Eagles Prior to the 2008 season Clark signed on with the Hanwha Eagles of the Korean Professional League. That season Clark hit 23 home runs with 80 RBI and 23 stolen bases, and was an All-Star. However, a midseason knee injury caused his average to drop from .315 to .250. Nexen Heroes In 2009 Clark signed and played with the Heroes, hitting .290 with 24 home runs and 90 RBI. He started the 2010 season with the Heroes, hitting .265 with 12 homers and 50 RBI, but was released from the team in July. Tigres de Quintana Roo After leaving the Korean league, Clark again shopped his talents to the baseball world and was signed by the Mexican League team Tigres de Quintana Roo for the 2011 season.

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 22 and 23 October 2009. It is the second serial of the third series, and marks the return of K9. Plot Part 1 The story opens with a \\"mad woman\\" in the attic of 13 Bannerman Road, in the year 2059 in Ealing. Sarah Jane and Luke, who previously lived in the house, are long gone, and Mr Smith ceased to function several years earlier. A teenage boy, Adam, investigates the attic, and learns that the \\"mad woman\\" is Rani, who had fought aliens with Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde. Rani has a flashback of 2009 in her adolescence, aged 15, in Sarah Jane's attic, at which time she overreacted when the group were not paying her much attention. Sarah Jane told her that a flash of lightning that struck the BT Tower was unimportant. Rani then received an email from an old friend, Sam, from her home town by the beach, whom she had told about her encounters with aliens. The email explained that people had been disappearing; Rani meets up with Sam, who sends her to investigate rumours of a demon in an abandoned fairground. Rani then meets Harry, the caretaker, whom she accompanies after lying to him about having a twisted ankle. Harry becomes frightened and tells Rani to leave, but she then sees people with red glowing eyes seemingly enjoying the funfair rides. Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde investigate Sam, who has lived at St Anthony's Children's Home since his parents died in a car accident in 2001. Leaving Luke with Sam, Sarah Jane and Clyde go to the funfair where they discover the red-eyed people on the rides. Rani is shut in a room with Eve, a girl with red skin and rope-like hair, who \\"just wants to play\\" and reveals that she is kidnapping lonely people to make them have fun. Rani is then convinced that she does not need to depend on Sarah Jane and that she should leave her forever. She then glimpses her future, as the mad woman in the attic. Part 2 Rani sees her future as a mad woman living in the attic of Sarah Jane's and wants to change it. She leads Eve out of the \\"haunted mine\\" ride. Eve takes control of the rides again, but Harry tells her to stop, as it will kill her, according to Ship. Eve then possesses Rani, like the other people in the fairground. Harry, Clyde and Sarah Jane then take Eve back to the beach, and K9 gives Ship the black hole energy it needs to leave, also allowing K9 to return home permanently. Rani is let free. Sam and Harry are invited to leave Earth with Eve. As Sarah Jane and her friends are about to leave, Ship grants Rani's wish that Sarah Jane, Luke and Clyde would leave her alone, not understanding that it was not intended literally, and they disappear. Adam reveals that he is the child of Sam and Eve, and he gives the older Rani the opportunity to change her past. Rani's timeline is altered so that Ship does not fulfil her wish. She is then shown in her alternative future, enjoying the company of her children and grandchildren. In this future, it is implied through dialogue that she has just returned from a trip to Washington where she and Luke were catching up with Maria. Continuity *When Ship looks into Sarah Jane's past, clips of her childhood from first and second season episodes, The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith, The Day of the Clown and Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?; these are followed by scenes of her time with the Doctor from the Third Doctor serials The Time Warrior (her introduction) and Planet of the Spiders, and when she returned to Earth in the Fourth Doctor serial The Hand of Fear (these clips also include footage of Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor and Tom Baker as the Fourth); she is also shown with K-9 Mark III from The Five Doctors and with the Daleks in \\"The Stolen Earth\\". Scenes of the near future show the TARDIS' arrival in the Smiths' attic in the following serial, The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith and a very brief glimpse of David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor running through its doors. This episode marks the first use of clips from the \\"classic era\\" of Doctor Who in The Sarah Jane Adventures, though still images of Sarah Jane and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart from the series have been seen previously. It is the second time classic series clips have been used in revived \\"Whoniverse\\" programmes (silent footage having been shown in \\"The Next Doctor\\") and the first time they have been used with sound. *Footage of the TARDIS from The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith marks the first appearance of the TARDIS in any Doctor Who spin-off, aside from a drawing previously seen in the Smiths' attic; (the TARDIS' sound effect was used at the end of the Torchwood episode, \\"End of Days\\"). *Scenes from Luke's past are from \\"Invasion of the Bane\\" (his activation) and The Last Sontaran (Maria's departure). *In the future, Rani Chandra is living in Sarah Jane's former home at 13 Bannerman Road. In the present day, she lives in Maria Jackson's former home at 36 Bannerman Road. *The Last Great Time War is referenced by Eve, although no names are mentioned, the allusions to \\"timelines\\" are clear.

An assessment by the UK's House of Lords Science and Technology Committee found that claims of health effects were unsubstantiated. An update in 2008 found no significant new evidence. The syndrome is not medically recognized.  Potential sources of contamination  Cabin Pressure and Bleed Air Control Panels on a upright Modern jetliners have environmental control systems (ECS) that manage the flow of cabin air. Outside air enters the engines and is compressed in the forward section, prior to the combustion section, ensuring no combustion products can enter the cabin. A portion of that compressed bleed air is used to pressurize the cabin. The ECS then recirculates some of that cabin air through HEPA filters, while the rest is directed to outflow valves, ensuring there is a constant supply of fresh, clean air coming into the cabin pressurization system at all times. Jet engines require synthetic oils for lubrication. These oils contain ingredients such as tricresyl phosphate (TCP or TOCP), an organophosphate, which can be toxic to humans but only in quantities much larger than are found in aviation engine oil. Engine bearing seals are installed to ensure that critical engine bearings are continuously lubricated, and to prevent engine oil from leaking into the compressed air stream. If a bearing seal fails and begins to leak, depending on the location of the seal, some amount of engine oil may be released into the compressed air stream. Oil leaks may be detected by an odour akin to hot frying-pan fume, or, in more serious cases, by smoke in the cabin. This is known in the industry as a fume event.  History  A year-long Australian Senate investigation in 2000 received evidence of some \\"successful applications for workers‚Äô compensation\\" for illness which the applicants attributed to exposure to fumes on a BAe 146. The applicants consisted of approximately 20 crew members who described oil fumes leaking into the aircraft cabin. That investigative committee concluded \\"the issue of fume contaminants should also be considered a safety issue with regard to the ability of cabin crew to properly supervise the evacuation of an aircraft and the ability of passengers to take part in an evacuation\\". On 5 November 2000, both the captain and first officer of a Jersey European Airways BAe 146 became unwell while landing at Birmingham International Airport. Both became nauseous, and the captain experienced double vision and had difficulty judging height, but managed to land the aircraft safely. Both pilots were taken to a hospital but no cause for their illness was found. The incident investigation report concluded that \\"There is circumstantial evidence to suggest that the flight crew on G‚ÄìJEAK were affected by contamination of the air supply, as a result of oil leakage from the auxiliary power unit (APU) cooling fan seal into the APU air stream, and into the ECS system ducting. This contamination allowed fumes to develop, a proportion of which entered the cabin and cockpit air supply.\\" The report noted that both captain and first officer had visited the forward toilet before the onset of their symptoms. Four years before the G-JEAK incident, another operator reported overuse of a disinfectant (formaldehyde) for the toilets and to clean the galley floor and that inhalation of the fumes from that chemical, would produce similar symptoms reported by both the captain and first officer of G-JEAK. \\"The CAA notified UK Operators at that time (CAA ref. 10A/380/15, dated 2 August 1996) of this potential hazard, as the misuse of this agent was apparently widespread.\\"  Research  In 1986, the United States Congress commissioned a report by the National Research Council (NRC) into cabin air quality. The report recommended a ban on smoking on aircraft in order to improve air quality. In 1988, the FAA banned smoking on domestic flights of less than two hours, and in 2000 extended the ban to all domestic and international flights. Research commissioned by the UK government's Department for Transport (DfT) and published in 2000 found no link to long term health. The UK Parliament's Select Committee on Science and Technology concluded in its response to the many complaints received \\"from a number of witnesses, particularly the Organophosphate Information Network, BALPA, and the International Association of Flight Attendants, expressing concerns about the risk of tricresyl phosphate (TCP or TOCP) poisoning for cabin occupants, particularly for crew who might be subjected to repeated exposure in some aircraft types, as a result of oil leaking into the cabin air supply.\\" :\\"This question - including the potential effects on aircrew from any long-term exposure - has been looked at in much greater detail by a Committee of the Australian Senate inquiring into particular allegations of such contamination in the BAe 146. Although its Report[58] referred extensively to cabin air quality and chemical contamination in the aircraft, and recommended that the engine lubricating oil used (a Mobil product) be subjected to a further hazardous chemical review, it made no specific points about TCP or TOCP that have given us additional concerns[59]. The absence of confirmed cases of TOCP poisoning from cabin air and the very low levels of TOCP that would be found in even the highly unlikely worst case of contamination from oil leaking into the air supply lead us to conclude that the concerns about significant risk to the health of airline passengers and crew are not substantiated.\\" According to a 2008 report by Michael Bagshaw, Aviation Medicine Director at King's College London, there have been no peer-reviewed recorded cases of neurological harm in humans following TCP exposure. He pointed to an unpublished report from the Medical Toxicology Unit at Guy's Hospital in 2001 which looked at all exposures dating back to 1943 that showed that all documented exposures were to high concentrations greatly in excess of the amount present in jet oil. In 2009 the UK House of Commons Library service to Members of Parliament summarized the research into a \\"relationship between the [engine oil chemical] leaks and these health symptoms\\" as inconclusive, citing \\"problems with identifying the exact chemical that might be entering the air supply and therefore identifying what impact it may have on health\\" and \\"reports of problems with fumes and/or health symptoms not being reported correctly\\". In the same year, a relatively innovative \\"clean air\\" system was established onboard the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing, the manufacturer of the airplane, is as of yet the only airline corporation to adopt this mechanism. In his 2013 paper, \\"Cabin Air Quality: A review of current aviation medical understanding,\\" Bagshaw noted further: \\"A German study in 2013 of 332 crew members who had reported fume/odour during their last flight, failed to detect metabolites of TCP in urine samples. The authors concluded that health complaints could not be linked to TCP exposure in cabin air.....A syndrome is a symptom complex, consistent and common to a given condition. Sufferers of the ‚Äòaerotoxic syndrome‚Äô describe a wide range of inconsistent symptoms and signs with much individual variability.\\" The evidence was independently reviewed by the Aerospace Medical Association, the US National Academy of Sciences and the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) Expert Panel. All concluded there is insufficient consistency to establish a medical syndrome, and the ‚Äòaerotoxic syndrome‚Äô is not recognised in aviation medicine.\\" The 'nocebo effect' was among the conclusions published in a 2013 COT (Committee on Toxicity) position paper: \\"The acute illness which has occurred in relation to perceived episodes of contamination might reflect a toxic effect of one or more chemicals, but it could also have occurred through nocebo effects. There is strong scientific evidence that nocebo effects can lead to (sometimes severely disabling) illness from environmental exposures that are perceived as hazardous.\\"  Media coverage  In a 2006 article in Aviation Today, Simon BennettBennett is director of the Scarman Centre's distance-learning MSc in Risk, Crisis and Disaster Management, with a PhD in sociology from Brunel University, London. found that media coverage of contaminated cabin air has been sensationalized, with distortions of facts. He cited headlines such as \\"You are being gassed when you travel by air,\\" and \\"Death in the Air\\" and a sub-title of \\"Every day, planes flying in and out of London City Airport are slowly killing us.\\" Bennett noted that the article with the latter subtitle stated in its body that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) found that oil seal failures occur only once in every 22,000 flights. The Sunday Sun in an article entitled \\"Flight Fumes Warning\\", cited the industry pressure group AOPIS in saying that passengers jetting off to their holidays were unknowingly exposed to deadly chemicals, and that brain damage could result if they breathed the toxic fumes. The Sun also cited the UK Civil Aviation Authority finding that leakage into aircraft cabins is a very rare event occurring only if there is a fault with an aircraft. When the results of a clinical audit of the \\"cognitive functioning of aircrew exposed to contaminated air\\" were submitted by Sarah Mackenzie Ross to the UK government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), some media used it to write articles that were sensational and misleading. Dagbladet.no, wrote that the Ross report \\"... adds weight to the hypothesis that compounds resembling nerve gas in cabin and flight deck air have caused irreparable neurological damage to aircrew\\", though the report itself stated that: \\"[T]he evidence available to us in this audit does not enable us to draw firm conclusions regarding a causal link with exposure to contaminated air.\\" Additionally, :The report was a \\"clinical audit of aircrew seen for clinical purposes,\\" and thus there were limitations to the study. :The \\"'aircrew seen for clinical purposes' were in fact a self- selecting sample of pilots.\\" Meaning that they all came from a group that already believed they had been damaged by contaminated air. :That self- selected sample group \\"was not compared to a control group.\\" Ross herself said \\"The conclusions that can be drawn from these findings have limitations.\\" :She further stated: \\"The author ... makes no attempt to ascribe causality.\\" :The report's conclusions were ambiguous: \\"There was no evidence of ... global intellectual decline, language or perceptual deficits .... Indeed pilots were intact on the vast majority of tests. However, there was evidence of under- functioning on tests associated with psychomotor speed, executive functioning and attention ....\\" :And finally, \\"[T]he evidence available to us in this audit does not enable us to draw firm conclusions regarding a causal link with exposure to contaminated air.\\" In 2015, made a documentary on aerotoxic syndrome called Unfiltered Breathed In.

The organization was founded in 1910, in Chicago, as the Drama League of America, and chapters were established throughout the United States. In 1911, the organization began to publish a monthly magazine called The Drama. In 1922, the Drama League established the Drama League Award, and formalized its annual presentation in 1935. History The Drama League was founded in Chicago in 1910 as the Drama League of America. The national organization was created with two primary objectives: to influence the professional production of the best plays by alerting members to performances that warranted their support; and to ensure the continuity of professional theatre by educating the audiences of the future. In 1911 the organization being publishing a monthly magazine, The Drama. By 1926, there were 37 local chapters, or centres, of the Drama League of America. After 17 years of existence, the New York Centre of the organization briefly disbanded, but reorganized in 1928. In 1934, the League decided to recognize theatrical achievement in a different way. A committee consisting of Broadway producers and other theatre professionals created the first‚Äîand still the only‚Äîaudience-selected award for distinguished performance in a theatrical production. Directors' Project In the 1980s, The Drama League experienced major transformation. It now also focused its efforts on providing a training program for directors, and a developmental and support program for playwrights. In 1984 the League initiated a program for young directors that combined training with intensive professional experience for entry-level or early career directors. The program has three phases: # A series of workshops under the guidance of prominent theatre professionals. # Assistant directing assignments (one at a regional theatre, one at a New York Theatre). # A Production with an Equity cast in New York City. In 1988, the Directors' Project was expanded to include a summer directing program to run in conjunction with the Hangar Theatre in Ithaca, New York. Participants in this program travel to the Hangar, where they each direct a children's show and at least two short plays, and serve as assistant director on a main stage production. The Directors' Project also includes two other programs, the New Directors/New Works program, and the Assistant Directors program.

Their stated satirical goals were meant to expose the moneyed interests in keeping the status quo of healthcare at the time.  Modus operandi Much like the earlier Billionaires for Bush, its members arrive at events (both pro and anti reform) in phony limousines wearing fancy attire (tuxedos, top hats, evening gowns, pearls etc.) and address one another by pseudonyms such as \\"Phil T. Rich\\", \\"Z. Roe Compassion\\" and \\"Frida Market\\". They carry signs with slogans such as Let Them Eat Advil, Do not Harm Our Bottom Line and If We Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It! (the latter also being the group's official motto). Their chants include: Walk. It. Off., Wealthcare, Not Healthcare! and Your pain, our gain. Their repertoire also includes songs with satirically modified lyrics set to well known tunes such as The Battle Hymn of the Republic and We Shall Overcome . They are always friendly and polite to reform opponents, making sure to thank them profusely for fighting to protect their supposed fortunes. Likewise they adopt a polite but faux taunting posture towards pro reform advocates. Often these tactics create confusion, with reform opponents returning their friendly gestures and supporters responding angrily back.  History  There were some remnants of the older Billionaires For Bush (B4B) members around the country that were beginning to push back against the Tea Party madness. The \\"Billionaires For Wealthcare\\" name was created and first used by a small group in Phoenix, AZ. Their first action was on August 22 2009 at a Tea Party Protest at Representative Harry Mitchell's office. They created the website and owned the domain. Local activist/videographer, Dennis Gilman, recorded the Billionaires encounter with the Tea Party protesters and produced an excellent video that garnered much media attention. Another group in North Carolina, led by Chase Foster, also began similar actions in the same time frame. After the media attention from the Arizona action, the Phoenix group decided to hand over the domain to the original Billionaires For Bush activists in New York. They were more capable in managing the website and expanding the movement in the same ways they had with B4B. They united the groups in AZ, NC and other cities under the B4W banner. Activities, growth and media coverage They had chapters in 20 states and the District of Columbia. The BFW have been featured or mentioned in numerous media outlets, both mainstream and underground.

It was last assigned to the 44th Operations Group, stationed at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota. The 67 MS was equipped with the LGM-30F Minuteman II Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), with a mission of nuclear deterrence. With the end of the Cold War, the 67th was inactivated on 15 August 1992. History World War II Established in early 1941 as a B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment squadron, it trained under the Third Air Force in the southeastern United States. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, it engaged in anti-submarine patrols over the Gulf of Mexico. Deployed to the European Theater of Operations (ETO), it was assigned to the Eighth Air Force (VIII Bomber Command) in England during the summer of 1942. One of the first B-24 Liberator units assigned to the ETO, the squadron was engaged in very long range strategic bombardment missions over Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany, attacking strategic targets in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Among the targets attacked were submarine installations, industrial establishments, airfields, harbors and shipyards. A detachment deployed to the Ninth Air Force in Algeria in June 1943 to help facilitate the Allied invasion of Sicily by bombing airfields and marshalling yards in Italy. The detachment also participated in the low-level raid on the Ploie»ôti oil fields in Romania on 1 August 1943. Most of the detachment returned to England at the end of August, however some crews and aircraft remained in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) and flew very long range attacks over Italy, Romania, Austria and Sicily and supported Allied ground forces in Sicily as well as attacking Axis forces in Italy. The squadron also supported the Salerno landing. All aircraft and personnel returned to England in October. Example: Missions of Capt. James E. Hill and his 10-man B-24 crew in 1943: 250px The squadron returned to VIII Bomber Command operations and supported the Allied Invasion of France in June 1944 by attacking strongpoints in the beachhead area and transportation targets behind the front line. The group aided the Caen offensive and the Saint-L√¥ breakthrough in July. It dropped food, ammunition and other supplies to troops engaged in the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September. It attacked enemy targets during the Battle of the Bulge between December 1944 and January 1945, by striking bridges, tunnels, rail and road junctions and communications in the battle area. The squadron attacked airfields and transportation in support of the Western Allied Invasion of Germany, and flew a resupply mission during the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. Combat operations concluded with the German capitulation in May 1945. The unit returned to the United States in June 1945, being reassigned to the Second Air Force and re-designated as a B-29 Superfortress 'Very Heavy' bombardment squadron. It trained with B-29s and planned to deploy to the Western Pacific, however the Japanese capitulation in August canceled these plans. It was assigned to Kansas as part of the Continental Air Forces, (later Strategic Air Command or SAC), but it was inactivated in July 1946 as part of the general demobilization of the AAF. Strategic Air Command Reactivated in 1947 under SAC as a paper unit, it was not manned or equipped and was inactivated in 1949 due to budget constraints. It was re-activated in 1950 and used as an Operational Training Unit for B-29 aircrews and maintenance personnel being deployed to the Far East Air Forces during the Korean War. The propeller-driven B-29s were replaced with new B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers in 1953. These aircraft were capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. The B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence in the late 1950s and were being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. The squadron began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in late 1959, before being phased down for inactivation in 1960. Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Squadron The unit was re-activated in 1962 as a SAC ICBM missile squadron. It trained with the 850th SMS in HGM-25A Titan I operations in 1962 and became operational with LGM-30B Minuteman I missiles in 1963. It upgraded to the LGM-30F Minuteman II in 1972. The squadron remained on Cold War nuclear alert until President Bush's directive to stand the Minuteman II down. Dissipated launch codes and pin safety control switches at 15 launch control facilities. Deactivation of the entire missile complex ended in the summer of 1992, the squadron inactivated on 15 August.

It is a frame house built in the late 19th century. It was one of the last buildings designed by regionally important architect Marcus F. Cummings. The building is one of the few houses he designed late in his career, and one of his few in the Queen Anne architectural style. It retains much of its ornate period interior decorations. In 1983 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was used for a time afterwards as the National Bottle Museum, which obtained a state matching grant to restore it. The museum later moved to larger quarters in the village's downtown following a legal dispute with its parent organization. Today the house is home to some professional offices. Building The house sits on a small lot on the west side of the street, just south of High Street (NY 67), partially shaded by tall trees. A parking lot has been built on the south side to serve the offices. The surrounding neighborhood is mostly residential. It is a two-and-a-half-story, four-by-six- bay house on a stone foundation, mostly sided in narrow clapboard with bands and panels emphasizing the structural supports. The slate roof is surrounded by a modillioned cornice. There are projecting two-story bays on the south and east, with a one-story raised balustraded porch on the east at the main entrance. Windows have decorative lintels. A corbeled brick chimney rises on the south end. The main entrance is a six-panel wooden door with stained glass sidelight and transom. It opens onto a central hall, decorated with early Art Nouveau style wallpaper in an embossed floral pattern, running nearly the length of the house, giving access to parlors and other rooms paneled in cherry. A walnut staircase with turned balusters rises to the second floor. Doors at the west end of both hallways have stained glass in the pattern of the hall decoration. On the floor, the oak in a parquet pattern is original. The house also has rare chandeliers that can support either gas or electric lights, functional steam radiators and an intact butler's pantry. It does not appear to have ever had any outbuildings. History The house was designed for James Verbeck, a prominent local attorney. It was one of the last houses built by Cummings, an architect known primarily for his commercial buildings in downtown Troy, before he retired in 1891. Most of his previous houses were built before 1869, in the wake of a devastating fire in Troy, and those were in the Italianate and Second Empire styles. His use of elements of the Queen Anne style here is a strong contrast to his earlier residential work. Verbeck's descendants owned the house until 1978, maintaining it and its furnishings near their original state. The next year, it was donated to the Federation of Historical Bottle Clubs, and converted into the National Bottle Museum. In 1989, the museum obtained a $46,000 state grant to restore the house, repainting it in the original colors, ascertained through paint chip analysis. The museum celebrated its ten-year anniversary in the house and the house's centenary with several events, including a bottle collectors' gathering and auction. Three years later, during a dispute between the federation and the museum, run by the National Bottle Museum Society, the museum was evicted. A covenant in the deed by which the Verbecks donated the house provided that if it were not used as a museum, ownership would revert to the family. As a condition of the grant that restored the house, which required that the house continue to be used as a museum for at least 23 years, the covenant was lifted. The federation put the house on the market. It is now the offices of a local insurance agency. and financial management firm.

One of the first B-24 Liberator units assigned to the ETO, it was soon engaged in very long range strategic bombardment missions over Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany, attacking strategic targets in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Among the targets attacked were submarine installations, industrial establishments, airfields, harbors and shipyards. A detachment deployed to the Twelfth Air Force in Algeria in June 1943 to help facilitate the Allied invasion of Sicily by bombing airfields and marshalling yards in Italy. The detachment also participated in the low-level raid on the Ploie»ôti oil fields in Romania on 1 August 1943. Most of the detachment returned to England at the end of August, however some crews and aircraft remained in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) and flew very long range attacks over Italy, Romania, Austria and Sicily and supported Allied ground forces in Sicily as well as attacking Axis forces in Italy opposing the Salerno landing. All aircraft and personnel returned to England in October. The squadron returned to VIII Bomber Command operations, and supported the Allied Invasion of France in June 1944 by attacking strongpoints in the beachhead area and transportation targets behind the front line. The group aided the Caen offensive and the Saint-L√¥ breakthrough in July. It also dropped food, ammunition and other supplies to troops engaged in the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September. The unit attacked enemy targets during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945, by striking bridges, tunnels, rail and road junctions and communications in the battle area. The squadron attacked airfields and transportation in support of the Western Allied Invasion of Germany, and flew a resupply mission during the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. Combat operations ceased with the German surrender in May 1945. The squadron returned to the United States in June 1945, being reassigned to the Second Air Force and re-designated as a B-29 Superfortress 'Very Heavy' bombardment unit. It trained with B-29s and planned to deploy to the Western Pacific, however the Japanese capitulation in August canceled these plans. It was assigned to Kansas as part of the Continental Air Forces (later Strategic Air Command or SAC), but it was inactivated in July 1946 as part of the general demobilization of the AAF. Strategic Air Command The squadron was re- activated in 1947 under SAC as a paper unit; it was not manned or equipped and inactivated in 1949 due to budget constraints. Reactivated once more in 1950, it was used as an Operational Training Unit for B-29 aircrews and maintenance personnel. It was deployed to the Far East Air Forces during the Korean War. The unit replaced its propeller-driven B-29s with new B-47E Stratojet swept- wing medium bombers in 1953. These machines were capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the late 1950s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence, and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. The squadron began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in late 1959, while being phased down for inactivation in 1960. Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Squadron The unit was re-activated in 1962 as a SAC ICBM missile squadron. It trained with the 850th SMS in HGM-25A Titan I operations in 1962 and was made operational with LGM-30B Minuteman I missiles in 1963. During March 1965 the squadron was responsible for the missile that was launched from a November Flight LF, 10 miles north of Newell, South Dakota. The program was called \\"Project Longlife\\" and was the only successful launch of a LGM-30 Minuteman missile from an operational site. The \\"Project Longlife\\" purpose was to test the launch capabilities from an operational site and to see how much damage the missile caused to the launch silo. The missile contained only enough fuel to burn for 7 seconds with a total flight time of 43 seconds. Many Minuteman missiles have been launched successfully from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The squadron was upgraded to the LGM-30F Minuteman II in 1972. It was located just north of the Black Hills, South Dakota, as part of the 44th SMW. The squadron was responsible for 50 missile silos, also called Launch Facilities (LF), broken down into groups of 10. Each ten missile silos had a control center, or Launch Control Facility (LCF), where two missile officers were on duty 24 hours a day. These LCFs were named after the phonetic alphabet, starting with Kilo. Lima, Mike, November, and Oscar were the other LCFs. The LCFs were designated as \\"one\\", hence Kilo 1 was the LCF, and Kilo 2 through 11 represented the actual missile silos controlled from Kilo 1. In addition to being a normal LCF, Kilo 1 was also the Alternate Command Post, or ACP. All of the other missile sites within the 44th Missile Wing (including the 66th and 67th SMS) reported to Kilo 1. The squadron remained on Cold War nuclear alert until President Bush's directive to stand the Minuteman II down. It dissipated launch codes and pin safety control switches at 15 launch control facilities. Deactivation of the entire missile complex ended in the spring of 1994; the squadron was inactivated on 5 July. Airborne Launch Control System In 1967, the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) was created to provide a survivable launch capability for the Minuteman ICBM force. From 1967 to 1970, one of the squadrons that ALCS missile crews belonged to was the 68th SMS at Ellsworth AFB, SD. These ALCS crews worked together with the 28th Air Refueling Squadron (AREFS) at Ellsworth AFB, who operated several EC-135 variants to include the EC-135A, EC-135G, and EC-135L, all of which had ALCS equipment installed on board.[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997.

Political career Born in Tucuman, Etchecopar attended the University of Buenos Aires and graduated with a law degree.A los 90 a√±os muri√≥ M√°ximo Etchecopar He became part of a Catholic cultural movement along with the likes of Leopoldo Marechal and Francisco Luis Bern√°rdez. A disciple and friend of Jos√© Ortega y Gasset he became a close ally of Rodolfo Irazusta and Carlos Ibarguren.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 118 He wrote for such journals as Sol y Luna and Nueva Politica in defence of oligarchy and in praise of Juan Manuel de Rosas. His works also appeared in Balc√≥n, the journal of anti-Semitic hardliner Julio Meinvielle. In 1942 he was a leading delegate at the Congresa de la Recuperaci√≥n Nacional at Buenos Aires, a failed attempt to unite the various strands of nationalist thought in the country. Diplomacy Following the failure of this initiative Etchecopar became a close ally of Mario Amadeo and under his influence became a supporter of Arturo Frondizi, moving away from nationalism. Etchecopar soon came to concentrate more fully on his diplomatic posts, holding a number of leading positions. He served as Consul-General in Cairo from 1947 to 1948 before moving on to London where he was stationed to 1949. He served as ambassador to the Vatican City from 1950 to 1955 and was awarded both the Order of Pius IX and Magistral Grace of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta for his service. He subsequently acted as Argentina's ambassador to Sweden, Peru, Mexico, Colombia and Switzerland whilst also serving as director of the main training centre for diplomats, the Instituto del Servicio Exterior de la Nacion, from 1966 to 1969. Writing Etchecopar was also noted as a writer, with his main books including Breve y varia lecci√≥n, Unos papeles de Lofredo Paz, Con mi generaci√≥n, Historia de una afici√≥n a leer, Esquema de la Argentina and El fin del Nuevo Mundo.

Komorowski, a Polish patriot and educator, was murdered by the Nazi occupiers at Stutthof concentration camp, together with a number of Polish activists captured during the Polish September Campaign. On 13 June 1999, Reverend Komorowski was among 108 Polish martyrs of World War II, beatified in Warsaw by Pope John Paul II.  Youth  Komorowski was born in Barloschno (today known as Bar≈Ço≈ºno), a village located some 65 kilometers south of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk). His parents were Jan Komorowski (1840‚Äì1892) and Katarzyna n√©e Gencza (1859‚Äì1925). The father, who was a widower with seven children, after the death of his first wife, Joanna Dluzewska, married Gencza in 1888, a widow with one child. They had three children ‚Äì Bronis≈Çaw, Wac≈Çaw (1890‚Äì1891), and Anna (1892-?). In 1892, after the death of Jan Komorowski, Katarzyna married a wealthy farmer Jan Fankidejski (1866‚Äì1934), with whom she had three more children. Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski was raised with the Fankidejski family, and among his stepfather's friends, there were local Polish activists of Eastern Pomerania, patriotic Roman Catholic priests, Jakub Fankidejski (1844‚Äì1883), who also was a historian and teacher at Collegium Marianum in Pelplin, and Feliks Bolt (1864‚Äì1940), who became a senator in the Second Polish Republic. Bronis≈Çaw attended a high school in Culm, and after graduation (1910), he joined a seminary in Pelplin. He was ordained in 1914, and sent to a parish in the village of Langenau, near Praust.  Priesthood  In 1915, he was transferred from Langenau to St. Nicolaus, one of the oldest churches in Danzig. The young vicar, apart from his church activities, helped Polish community of the city, teaching the children Polish history and Polish language. Since 1919, all his sermons were in Polish. In 1923, together with a group of activists, he founded Association of Construction of Polish Churches (Towarzystwo Budowy Kosciolw Polskich), which was a counterbalance to local churches, where German priests were in the majority. Due to his efforts, in 1924, local Poles received former military complex in Langfuhr, where St. Stanislaus Church was opened in May 1925. The church quickly became one of the most important centers of Polish community of the Free City of Danzig, where numerous celebrations took place.  Activities in the Free City of Danzig  Between 1933 and 1934, Komorowski was the only Polish member of the 54-person City Council of the city. He ran in the 1933 election to the Popular Assembly (Volkstag), but lost. For a few weeks in 1935, Komorowski served in the Assembly, for Erazm Czarnecki, who had temporarily left Danzig, after that, he ran in the 7 April 1935 election, losing again. Later on, he founded Gmina Polska Association of Poles, and was a very active member of the Polish community. On 10 October 1937, the Bishop of Danzig, Edward O'Rourke, nominated Komorowski to the post of a parish priest of the so-called personal parishes, which served Polish minority of the city. However, under pressure of Danzig's national socialists, O'Rourke's decision was cancelled by the authorities of the Free City of Danzig. As a result, the Bishop resigned from his post, and was replaced by Karol Maria Splett, who did not give permission to create Polish personal parishes. Father Komorowski, who also served Polish students in Danzig, supported and protected them on several occasions. On 25th anniversary of his service, 2 April 1939, a special mass took place in St. Stanislaus Church, which turned into a patriotic demonstration. Among the faithful, there was General Commissioner of Poland in Danzig, Marian Chodacki.  Death  On 1 September 1939, Father Komorowski together with other Polish priests, was arrested, beaten, and sent to a prison in Danzig‚Äôs Victoriaschule. Soon afterwards, the Germans placed him in Stutthof concentration camp. Polish World War II survivor Roman Chrzanowski wrote in his book \\"Gda≈Ñsk 1939\\": \\"I remember when a week after my arrival, Father Komorowski was taken out of some basement. He was led to the middle of a field, where he was knocked unconscious. Covered in blood, he did not look like a human being. After having been thrown into a barrel with water, he was sent back to the basement\\".Waldemar Matlan, Polish patriots in Gdansk Komorowski, together with a number of Polish activists, was murdered on Good Friday, 22 March 1940 in the woods near the camp. After the war, all bodies were exhumed, and buried at a cemetery in the Gda≈Ñsk district of Zaspa. On 13 June 1999, Reverend Komorowski was among 108 Polish martyrs of World War II, blessed in Warsaw by Pope John Paul II.

Almost immediately, the USAAF IX Engineer Command 816th Engineer Aviation Battalion began clearing the base of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft and repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. The engineers laid down a single 5000' (1500m) all-weather Prefabricated Hessian Surfacing/Compressed Earth runway (3600 PHS/1400 ETH) aligned 14/32. In addition, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Once refurbished, it was known as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-35\\".IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout The 36th Fighter Group, based P-47 Thunderbolt fighters at Le Mans from 25 August though late September 1944.

The fighter planes flew support missions during the Allied invasion of Normandy, patrolling roads in front of the beachhead; strafing German military vehicles and dropping bombs on gun emplacements, anti-aircraft artillery and concentrations of German troops in Normandy and Brittany when spotted. The C-47s participated in Operation Market-Garden, the airborne invasion of the Netherlands, carrying troops of the 82d Airborne Division to a drop site near Groesbeek on 17 September 1944. The following day, the 440th towed CG-4A Waco gliders to the same general location with reinforcements and supplies. Another glider towing resupply and reinforcement mission was flown to Overasselt, the Netherlands on 23 September.

They later declared the day as \\"Prakalpana Day\\" because to them \\"the earth stood still\\" on the natal day of the movement. Swatotsar, the journal of the movement was published by Vattacharja Chandan and named by Dilip Gupta. Swatotsar was dubbed to be an \\"anti-magazine\\" for, in keeping with its iconoclastic content, the magazine was printed to be read in Asian style‚Äîi.e. from back to front. In addition, Swatotsar was shaped like an axe blade, an axe (according to its editors) to be used against the roots of conventionalism. Up to that time, modern Bengali literature and art had been over-burdened by colonial styles, adaptations and ideas such as Surrealism, Absurdist literature, the Beat Generation, Existentialism, Concrete poetry, free verse, blank verse, etc. Consequently, the Prakalpana Movement seeks, as its goal, the defining and promulgating of a brand new, indigenous genre of literature for the literary world of the new millennium. A tiny literary revolution Steve LeBlanc who interviewed Vattacharja Chandan in the beginning of the nineties, wrote: > For all the cliches, deserved or not, and despite its ponderous social > problems, Calcutta has, for the past 20 years or so nurtured a tiny literary > revolution by the mysterious name of Prakalpana Literature. Championed by > its founder and chief conspirator Vattacharja Chandan, Prakalpana > Literature\\\\--the name of the movement and the title of its own bilingual > (Bengali and English) chapbook lit-zine has tried to define a whole new kind > of writing, one that draws from all genres, drama to poetry to fiction. For > an obscure literary movement, Prakalpana has drawn fans far outside the > borders of India including underground American writers and mail art fans > from around the globe\\"...Songs of Kobisena by Steve LeBlanc, Version 90, PMS > Cafe Press, Alston, MS, USA. Vattacharja Chandan, the creator of the concept of this movement initially coined the term Prakalpana, deriving it from Prabandha(essay)+ Kabita(poetry)+ Galpa(story)+ Natak(drama). But later to make the new form globally more acceptable and perceptible, he extended the purview, span and scope of Prakalpana as the convergence of: P for prose, poetry, opera + R for story, drama + A for art, essay + K for kinema + L for culture + N for song, novel...etc.Sarbangin Artmosphere, Generator, Number 7, Mentor, OH, USA. Influence Since visuals are frequently used in Prakalpana, some critics think that the movement features concrete or visual poetry. Actually, Prakalpana is more narrative fiction than poetry, though poetry and visuals might be used in parts of Prakalpana if the concerned writer finds it suitable to mix genres in the same piece of writing. The resulting form is Prakalpana only‚Äînot any other of the discrete ingredients. Moreover, Swachhando or Flow verse, the rhythm of Sarbangin Poetry, is also not concrete poetry, visual poetry, free verse or other pre-conceived forms or meters, but was created from a mixing of prosaic and poetic rhythms and got its name from the pioneering, similarly named Bengali and English poems by Chandan. Prakalpana World Prakalpana Sahitya: Prakalpana Literature magazine began its journey in 1977 to bring all the forms of Prakalpana literature and Sarbangin poetry movement under a single umbrella, as Swatotsar was publishing mostly Prakalpana. So Swatotsar was closed after more than ten years of its existence in 1979 having published twenty issues, in favour of Kobisena and Prakalpana Literature. Bilingual Prakalpana Literature has been publishing Prakalpana, Sarbangin Poetry and all other kinds experimental and avant-garde poetry, apart from essay, review, literary news, letter and artwork from around the globe. It has published sporadically twenty three issues so far. Ashish Deb had left Swatotsar after the first issue and he came back for a short stint in 2005. Dilip Gupta had deserted the movement in 1978 and returned after almost eight years in the eighties. From the very beginning of the movement it did not solely depend on the contributions from the members of the group only as usually like other movements. On the contrary over all these long years, countless non-commercial Indian as well as writers and artists from around the world have contributed to this movement, which have always fertilised and revitalised the movement with longer life and global ambience. To name some of them are: Sammohan Chattopadhyay, Dilip Gupta, Asish Deb, Sukla Mojumdar, Satya Ranjan Biswas, Bablu Roy Choudhury, Shyamoli Mukherjee Bhattacharjee, Ramratan Mukhopadhyay, Nikhil Bhaumik, Baudhayan Mukhopadhyay, Rishin Mitra, Utpal, Niva De, Shaswata Shikdar, Vattacharja Chandan, Uttar Basu,....and Fern G. Z. Carr (Canada), Hugo Pontes, (Brazil); Alfred A Walker, Gerald England (UK); Carla Bertola, (Italy); Jesse Glass,(Japan); Christian Burgaud (France); and John Byrum, Richard Kostelanetz, Don Webb, John M. Bennett, Sheila Murphy, Geof A. Huth, Jeramy Dodds, Brett K. Fletcher, Mick Cusimano &c.....;(USA). Reviews of Kobisena and Prakalpana Literature in the much-read US review magazine Factsheet Five and currently in Zine World and other reviews on line along with the enlistment in the International Directory of Little Magazines and Small Presses, and Poet's Market, enabled the movement to get submissions from different parts of the world. In 1997 Vattacharja Chandan, representing Bengali Literature with Sunil Gangopadhyay and a few others, participated in the Asian Literary Leaders' Conference in Washington DC,USA, where he had informal discussions with some international writers on the movement. When he presented Kobisena to poet Derek Walcott, the Nobel laureate wrote on it:'With thanks'. His visit to some other countries including Bangladesh helped spread to some extent the gospel of this movement abroad. To reach the common non- literary audience, several issues of Kobisena and Prakalpana Literature were published with consumer datebooks which proved popular. In addition to the artists and mail artists like Jorge Ignacio Nazavel Cowan, Syamoli Mukherjee Bhattacharjee, Mick Cusimano, Christian Burgaud, Carla Bertola, Vattacharja Chandan, Norman J. Olson, Hugo Pontes etc., they have also published the works of eminent artists like Rabindranath Tagore, Ramkinkar Baij, Mukul Dey, Sunil Das, Rabin Mandal, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Pranabesh Maity &c.; Here are samples how the international neutral critics are viewing this movement: > :\\"...the other day, I received a brilliant small press mag from India, > Prakalpana Literature, written half in Bengali and half in English, and > filled with oddities from around the world.

It seems a > positive gesture in establishing communication between different literary > and Kobisena the Poet Troop In September 1972 at a convention in Vidyasagar Hall in Kolkata, triggered off a new outfit named Kobisena (meaning Poet troop) of the poetry by the poetry and for the poetry. Accordingly, a pamphlet of four pages, edited by Vattacharja Chandan and published by Rabindra Bhattacharya was out in December, being the mouthpiece of the Sarbangin Poetry Movement‚Äîthe poetry front of Prakalpana Movement. About Sarbangin Poetry (Kobita) Steve LeBlanc observed: > \\" In order to separate prakalpana from collage poetry and other forms of > experimental literature, Chandan introduces the concept of 'Sarbangin > Kobita'-- poetry that grows out of proper imagination, feeling and > realization. Sarbangin Kobita reveals what Chandan describes as > chetanavyasism (wholeness of cosmic matter and revealed sense) while > utilizing the wholesome and artful repetition of words and visuals, sonorous > and mathematical effects in Flow Verse rhythm. The term Sarbangin itself > derives from Chandan's poem 'Kobitaay Sarbangin Amritakharan' and an > accompanying theoretical essay 'Sarbangin Kobita Jagga' published in > Kobisena, a sister publication of Prakalpana Rabindra Bhattacharya left the movement thereafter soon. But Kobisena has been continuing its run still today, piloted by the same editor to publish its new kind of Sarbangin Poetry and to popularise poetry through public performances of poetry reading even in unlikely places like outside the corn field in a village, in front of book stalls of Bengal Cultural Conference, at Kolkata Book Fair, or Kolkata Art Fair, in spite of being encountered by other stall owners which hampered their sales due to the gathering of large crowd attracted by their open readings. In 1973, Kobisenas even stormed into the East Zone Cultural Conference, convened by the government, in procession with posters and festoons and questioned the organizers as to why the new poetry and poets had not been included as the subject of discourses, which resulted in pandemonium and hurried closure of the day's session and thereafter the capture of the dias by the Kobisenas and rejuvenate the session.Ananda Bazar Patrika, Kolkata, 30 December 1973.Purba Bharatiya Sanskritir Ruprekha P 271, Dr. Nilkanta Singh, West Bengal Government, Kolkata, 1977. Besides they kicked off crazy extempore readings at fairs, train, street, beneath the statue, even on the merry go round as well as at countless literary fests and seminars in different grounds and halls. Just as one was the Prakalpana Litfest 2009 on 6 September, the Prakalpana Day in Jibanananda Sabhaghar, Kolkata. Many eminent persons had graced these occasions in different times, to name some of them: Nagarjun, Monindra Roy, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Prakash Karmakar, Madison Morrison, Amitava Dasgupta, Ananda Ghoshhajra, Sandipan Chattopadhyay...&c.; On several occasions Kobisenas used painted hats, belts and peculiar attires and musical instruments to attract the audience.Satyajug, Kolkata, 10 January 1983. The performers of poetry who in different times made their marks were Bablu Roy Choudhury, Rabindra Bhattacharya, Kashinath Mandal, Narak Das, Ashok Bosu, Arun Kumar Chakraborty and Vattacharja Chandan. Chandan even uses his music and songs with his performance of poetry. Since the eighties Kobisena has been published bilingual to reach the global shore. So far it has forty- four issues infrequently published. And this small pamphlet has been an avid traveller around the world. But as to how it has fared, let us read a bit of unaffiliated independent reactions: > :\\" This is an eight sided issues focusing avant garde/ experimental poetry > which frequently includes graphics in the body of the work. The pamphlet is > unusual in several ways, It is bilingual, printed in Bengali and English, > and it carries the exhortation Please copy this issue and distribute > anywhere in the globe....The poetry found in Kobisena is full of the same > concerns poets write of everywhere: relationship and family, life and love, > existence and imagination.

Still the humble impact of Prakalpana Movement as arguably perhaps one of the most important among the experimental and avant garde literary scene in India that has a global presence at this point of time, is evident from the fact that the experimental short stories in Bengali literature seem to have been arranged and deranged on the lines of prakalpana form, which paradoxically is not at all short story. And also the sporadic use of signs, symbols, pictures and henceforth considered unliterary material are being used now in some literature as has been used by Prakalpanites and Kobisenas long ago. Nowadays adopting the western ways and styles is the trendy high tide, rampant and go with the flow downstream everywhere else as in Bengali Literature and art since the colonial days. But being based in Bengali literature, export of the indigenous new concepts of Prakalpana, Chetanavyasism, Sarbangin Poetry, Flow Verse... etc. into the global literary arena in reverse swing from India is an arduous task in the low tide against strong high tides to the upstream. This is more so especially for a non- commercial non-conforming yet non-confronting alternative movement like Prakalpana, being completely independent of the myth of mainstream establishment and anti-establishment and new media communications. This goal might seem however implausible and ambitious to be achieved by an independent alternative literary and art movement like Prakalpana, but not to its artificer and mentor Vattacharja Chandan, who has been spearheading the Movement in each and every theory and practice so far without bothering for any obstacles from the very beginning. And with his world vision catalogue, he still wants to gear up this movement, simply and solely banking on the virtual latent support of some independent, known and unknown brand new and old band of writers, artists and readers scattered around the world. His immediate associate Prakalpanite teammates currently include Ramratan Mukhopadhyay, Nikhil Bhaumik, Bablu Roy Choudhury, Syamoli Mukherjee Bhattacharjee, Boudhayan Mukhopadhyay, and Utpal. The Prakalpanites simply want to plant and spread the seeds of a few new Chetanavyasist species in the literary and art world. But whether they will weather the storm or wither away in some unfavorable literary climate, or forest and flower in a new earth in the new millennium, only the future will say. But so far their spirit is, as one daily newspaper once commented: > \\" The blue blood of the Kobisenas' pen never dries up\\". Dainik Basumati, Kolkata. And as of this time, > \\"For literature that crosses the boundaries this is a good place to look\\". Ku in New Hope International Review On Line, UK.
