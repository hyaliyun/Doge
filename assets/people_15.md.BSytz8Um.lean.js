She was born in Malgrat de Mar (province of Barcelona, Catalonia) to a Puerto Rican mother and a Spanish father. She later lived in the United States, studied in Columbia University, and spent the duration of the Spanish Civil War (18 July 1936 - 1 April 1939) writing her Diario (\\"Diary\\") in Cuba. Her brother, Jos√© Camprub√≠, was owner and publisher of La Prensa, New York's most important Spanish-language daily newspaper, from 1918 to 1942. She eventually became a professor at the University of Maryland before her death from ovarian cancer, aged 69, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, two days after her husband Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez received the Nobel Prize in Literature. Early life  At 4 o'clock in the morning of August 31, Zenobia Salustiana Edith Camprub√≠ y Aymar was born in Calle del Mar 87, in Malgrat de Mar (Barcelona) in a wealthy Spanish-Puerto Rican family. She was registered with the name of Zenobia, Salustiana, and Edith. Zenobia Camprub√≠ Aymar was the daughter of Isabel Aymar Lucca and Raimundo Camprub√≠ Escudero. Her maternal grandfather, Augusto Aymar, was a well-off American merchant and her grandmother was a member of a family of Corsicans, settled in Puerto Rico. Both her mother and grandmother had studied in the best schools in the United States and had many family ties in the United States. Her father, Raimundo Camprub√≠, was an engineer of roads, canals and ports, and, belonged to a family of Catalan military. Zenobia's parents got married in Puerto Rico in 1879, where he had traveled to work for the construction of a highway between Ponce and Coamo. The couple had four children Jos√© (1879), Raimundo, Zenobia (1887) and Augusto. During the first two years of her life, when summer time arrived, the Camprub√≠ family moved to ‚ÄòLa Quinta‚Äô in Malgrat to enjoy the pleasant Mediterranean climate in the summer season. In the winter of 1890, her brother Augusto Camprub√≠ Aymar was born in Barcelona. This would be the last year that Zenobia and her family enjoy the holidays in Malgrat, the reason probably related to the changes of post that her father had. At the age of nine she traveled to the United States for the first time with her brother Jos√© and her mother. The reason was to enter his older brother in a high school in preparation for his subsequent entry into Harvard (Cambridge) and settle the matter of inheritance, due to the fact that her grandmother had died in 1895. After the appearance of Zenobia's health problems, the family was forced to move their residence to the municipality of Sarri√° a year later. In this place, Zenobia meets Maria Muntadas de Capar√°, with whom she will establish a great friendship. In 1900, Zenobia founds a partnership, together with her friend Maria Muntadas, that is called \\"Las Abejas Industriosas\\". By that time she had not yet reached thirteen years of age, but she was already seeing a great spirit of restlessness and organization. In 1901, her father, Mr. Raimundo Camprub√≠, was assigned to Tarragona as Head of Public Works. Zenobia travelled with her mother and younger brother Augusto to Switzerland in search of remedy for a rare ear and eye disease that her brother had suffered after a diphtheria. In March of the same year, the New York youth magazine St. Nicholas published a short story of Zenobia called A Narrow Escape. Also published is her autobiographical work Malgrat, inspired by her stay in the coastal town. Zenobia's father is then transferred to Valencia. During their stay in this city, the family will live on Calle Navelos 14. Beginning the saddest and most boring time of her childhood begin. Zenobia writes and publishes several literary works, among them, The Garret I have known. Zenobia took care of the operation of the family house in Valencia because her mother left for a season with her family in Barcelona. She received a literary award consisting of a Gold Badge from St. Nicholas Illustrated Magazine for Boys and Girls for her work When Grandmother went to school. As a result of a marriage separation, Isabel Aymar (mother of Zenobia) and Zenobia, her daughter, moved to live in the United States in 1905. They settled in Newburgh (New York) where many family members and family friends lived. The trip began with a visit to Canada in September, accompanied by her maternal uncle Jos√©, and her brother Raimundo. They were to Qu√©bec, where her aunt Lillian awaiting them. During these years, her life in the United States is totally different from the Spanish one. She travelled through Washington, Boston and New York. She attended dances, meetings, lunches, teas and all kinds of social events. Meanwhile, she continued reading and studying ‚Äì Latin, literature, music, European and American history ‚Äì writing, attending cultural events, preparing for the future, taking care of her formation. She began to be courted by a lawyer, friend of the family, Henry Shattuck. In 1908, Zenobia enrolled in the Teacher's College of the University of Columbia (New York) to study English literature and composition. After the marriage's reconciliation, Mrs. Isabel Aymar returned to Spain in 1909 in the company of Zenobia and her cousin Hannah. They called \\"the Little American,\\" since she began her university studies in Columbia; she attended cultural activities and women's clubs. She came into contact with American feminism, traveled alone, read the Spanish and English classics and followed a course on literature. They settled in La R√°bida (Huelva) where Mr. Raimundo Camprub√≠ was the chief engineer of the port of Huelva. In a room of the house where they settled, Zenobia improvised a school to teach a group of nineteen children of the surroundings. In 1910, Zenobia's father was transferred to Madrid. The family residence was set in Paseo de la Castellana 18. On the return from a short trip to Switzerland in March 1911, Zenobia and her mother went through Barcelona and visited Malgrat. This was the first time that Zenobia returned to her native house, which she found \\"sad and dark\\". In October, the third trip of Zenobia to the United States takes place on the occasion of the birth of the first daughter of her brother Jos√©, In√©s. The idea of exporting crafts, embroidery and books to North America arises. In the first months of the year 1912, Zenobia returned to Madrid, she continued to publish articles in American magazines. She took advantage of all that Madrid offered and got involved in cultural and intellectual projects. There, she was related primarily concerned with Americans, she was distressed because she could not move freely alone until she met Susan Huntington, who ran the Instituto Internacional de se√±oritas, where foreigners were staying, attending the summer courses they organized. Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez Dedication of Juan Ramon Jim√©nez to Zenobia In 1913, Zenobia kept an epistolary relationship with her North American suitor Henry Shattuck, who came to Spain in May to discuss details about a possible marriage. The 9 July, through a letter, the relation splits up to start being friends. She assisted many conferences, but she could only do so if she was accompanied by an American couple, the Byne. This couple organized parties and in them, she heard about a fierce and strange poet hosted in the residence, who complained about the noise but stuck his ear to the wall when he heard Zenobia's laugh, who he didn't know yet. Zenobia met Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez in 1913, in a conference imparted by Bartolom√© Coss√≠o, celebrated in the Residence where he worked. In 1914, Zenobia translated some verses from The Crescent Moon by Tagore, including a prologue-poem by Juan Ram√≥n. In June she visited √Åvila y Segovia. By the end of the year, there were some disagreements between Juan Ram√≥n and Zenobia. They couldn't deliver La Luna Nueva by Tagore on time for its publication, and to compensate this problem they published the children edition of Platero y yo. In December, Zenobia and her mother boarded in C√°diz on their way to New York, to avoid the relationship of her daughter with the poet. But, on 12 February 1916 the poet Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez arrived to New York and on 2 March Zenobia and him got married in the Catholic Church St. Stephen of New York. They travelled around the United States: Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington... On 7 June they boarded on the ship \\"Montevideo\\", accompanied by Mrs. Isabel Aymar, destination Spain. After landing in C√°diz they arrived to Sevilla, where they spent a couple of days, on their way to La Palma del Condado, where they were expected by Juan Ram√≥n's relatives, who wanted to know his wife at last. On 1 July they arrived to Madrid. In 1917, Zenobia translated and published El Jardinero, El Cartero del Rey, P√°jaros perdidos and La Cosecha by Tagore. Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez added a prologue-poem to them. Also in collaboration with Juan Ram√≥n, she translated El Asceta, El rey y la Reina, Malini, Ofrenda L√≠rica, Las Piedras Hambrientas and Ciclo de Primavera, all of them by Tagore. The same way that Katherine Bourland, Mar√≠a de Maeztu y Rafaela Ortega y Gasset, Zenobia founded in Madrid \\"La Enfermera a Domicilio\\" in 1918, an association which purpose was taking care of ill children and adults from working families, providing them with food and medication and taking them to dispensaries and to the consult of prestigious doctors that attended them for free. In addition, she took control of a little business that compensated the economical problems of the couple, she calmed her husband's mood, encouraging his quill and sorting out problems as important as abandoning Spain with dignity after the outbreak of the Civil War in Spain. On 6 April 1920, the play El Cartero del Rey by Tagore was premiered, translated and adapted to theatres by Zenobia. There were three functions in several days. She made a partnership with her friend In√©s Mu√±oz to continue with the labor of exportation of handicraft, embroidery, ceramic and books to America. They had already received and managed her brother Jos√©'s products. In October, beside Mar√≠a Goyri de Men√©ndez Pidal and Mar√≠a de Maeztu, she founded the Comit√© para la Concesi√≥n de Becas a Mujeres Espa√±olas en el Extranjero. She was secretary since its foundation until 1936. Then, the idea of another business came up: sublet apartments that she would furnish. Her relatives and North American friends used to ask her to look for an apartment with certain characteristics to stay in Madrid, something that wasn't easy, so she decided to do it herself. Juan Ram√≥n and Zenobia moved to 8, Lista St. in 1921. The representation of John M.Synge's play, Jinetes hacia el mar and Zenobia's version and translation of La hermana mayor, by Tagore was made in the Athenaeum of Madrid. In 1922, she did a short trip to Catalonia and Baleares with her friend In√©s Mu√±oz. In Barcelona she would visit her paternal uncle Jos√© Camprub√≠ and her childhood friends. On 15 March 1924, the engineer Raimundo Camprub√≠ died in Madrid, at the age of 78. By the end of June and starting of July, Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n, invited by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca and his family, enjoyed their holidays in Granada; this was not the first time she travelled to this city. In August they spent some days in Moguer and in October they travelled again to around Andaluc√≠a, across M√°laga, C√≥rdoba, Sevilla and Moguer. In 1926, the Lyceum Club Femenino Espa√±ol was founded in Madrid, one of the first women associations created in Spain. Zenobia would be the secretary while Mar√≠a de Maeztu was the president. She developed an important labour impacting noticeably in the cultural scene in those times. In summer, the couple travelled through Spain, they went all over the North West area of the peninsula: Soria, Logro√±o, Pamplona, San Sebasti√°n, Bilbao, Santander, Asturias, Santiago de Compostela, Vigo and Le√≥n. In 1928, the \\"Arte Popular Espa√±ol\\" was inaugurated in Madrid, dedicated to the selling of Spanish handicraft. She decorated the Parador Nacional Sierra de Gredos. On 18 August Mrs. Isabel Aymar died. On July 1929, the couple travelled to Salamanca where they met Unamuno and also they met Zenobia's older brother, Jos√©, and her family came to Spain to visit the expositions of Barcelona and Seville and they would also visit Moguer. In August, they travelled to Southern France and visited Fuenterrab√≠a, Ir√∫n, Hendaya, Biarritz, Bayone, Pau and Tarbes, and settled in Lourdes. In the middle of August 1930, her sister- in-law Ethel and her niece Leontine accompanied Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n travel to Vigo to board towards New York. From Vigo, the couple went to Barcelona to visit Zenobia's friends. In 1931, Zenobia was detected a tumour and she decided not to submit herself to a surgery. She received the X-Ray treatment to avoid the growth. The sculptor Marga Gil Ro√´sset sculpted a Zenobia bust. Zenobia worked in 1935 as decorator of the hotel Paradero de Ifach, in Calpe (Alicante) and progressively stops subletting apartments, as that she decorates is not worthwhile. Exile In the early days of the conflict, Juan Ram√≥n and Zenobia collaborated with the protection of minors in the care and accommodation of children orphaned by the war: they welcomed twelve children from 4 to 8 years of age, in a flat at Velazquez Street. On 22 August 1936, they left Spain. Four days later they boarded in Cher-village in the 'Aquitaine' liner bound for New York and de couple began a journey in which they visited Cuba, United States, Buenos Aires and Puerto Rico, where Zenobia worked as a teacher at the University of Puerto Rico. In 1937 and 1938 the Jim√©nez marriage was located in Cuba and lived in the Hotel Vedado from the Havana. They developed a series of social and cultural activities, as well as, taking part in a political act of support on the Spanish Republican side. They continued taking care of Spanish's orphan's children and fundraising through subscriptions in the press of New York newspapers and other publication. Zenobia also worked as a volunteer in women's prisons and donated her clothes. In January 1939, they moved to New York to settle in Coral Gables, Miami (Florida). At the end of the Civil War, the flat that Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n had in Madrid that survived during all the conflict had been robbed: books, documents and other personal items. In January of the following year, when Juan Ram√≥n taught his first formal lecture at the University of Miami, Zenobia simultaneously read an English version translated by her. In 1942 her older brother died of a heart attack, Jos√© Camprub√≠. In 1943 Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n moved to Washington and, in January of the next year, the University in Maryland wanted Zenobia to teach Spanish to a group of soldiers. After that, they decided to hire her as a teacher in the Department of history and European culture too. In 1945 they moved to live in Riverdale because she was given a permanent job. Two years later, they bought a house where she and Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez taught classes. In 1948 the couple travelled around Argentina and Uruguay. The trip was extended more than three months so the poet could give 12 more lectures. Neither Juan Ram√≥n nor Zenobia imagined the massive and warm reception they received there. In 1950, they travelled during November and December to Puerto Rico due to the nervous breakdowns of Juan Ram√≥n. In 1951, he had to get a cancer operation in Boston. In 1954, he had to have another operation in Puerto Rico, because he didn't want to live in the United States. Zenobia not only left behind an interesting life, but also the possibility of receiving a good treatment for her own health problem. Zenobia signed a contract with the University of Puerto Rico to translate scientific brochures for a year. She started her classes at the University of R√≠o Piedras. At the end of the year, she got operated from cervical cancer in the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In February 1952 she recovered and returned to Puerto Rico. She continued her work at the University. On 18 August, Zenobia performed in the Puerto Rico oath as an American citizen, thus she got dual citizenship. At the beginning of 1953, her brother Augusto suffered a cancer and he spent a season with her and Juan Ram√≥n in Puerto Rico before returning to the United States where he would die at the end of March. Zenobia completed her cancer treatment. Final Years In 1954, Zenobia stopped working at the University because she was given high medical advice. The American magazine published an autobiographical entitled Juan Ram√≥n and I. In 1956, the cancer reappeared and in April and Zenobia started a treatment that would give her great burns. In the month of June, Zenobia flow to Boston for the purpose of being operated again, but the doctors told her not to have the operation and gave her only a few months to live. Zenobia died on 28 October 1956, in Puerto Rico, three days after her spouse received the Nobel Prize for literature. Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez survived two more years, and today, they remain in Moguer, in the cemetery of Jesus. Legacy In 1955, and at their behest, the University of Puerto Rico established a research room for the couple which would concentrate on their personal library and on modern Hispanic literature. The research room now also covers publications about the couple and contains an approximate total of 105,699 volumes and documents. It bears the name of Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez to this day. The House of culture Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n was created in Moguer.

Location and naming  The Gasherbrum massif is a remote group of peaks located at the northeastern end of the Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram range of the Himalaya. The massif contains three of the world's 8,000 metre peaks (if one includes Broad Peak). Gasherbrum is often claimed to mean \\"Shining Wall\\", presumably a reference to the highly visible face of Gasherbrum IV; but in fact it comes from \\"rgasha\\" (beautiful) + \\"brum\\" (mountain) in Balti, hence it actually means \\"beautiful mountain.\\" While the four highest Gasherbrum peaks (Gasherbrum I to IV) have been named and numbered since the 19th century, Gasherbrum V (as well as its neighbour Gasherbrum VI) were only considered as \\"Peaks on the south ridge of Gasherbrum IV\\". The Swiss Geologist and Himalayan expert G√ºnter Oskar Dyhrenfurth recommended to give this independent mountain an own name and proposed in 1934 the name of \\"Gasherbrum V\\", which is now well established.G. O. Dyhrenfurth: Zum Dritten Pol. M√ºnchen, 1952, S. 239  Altitude and climbing status  Although in former literature a height around 7,320 m was traditionally given, the mountain is more likely to be around 7,150 m high. The Russian military 1:100,000 topographical map shows a height of 7,120 m. The currently most accurate map of the region probably is that in the series of \\"Maps of Snow Mountains in China\\", which gives a height of 7,147 m.

It was part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and staffed by civil servants, many of whom were corporate finance professionals with private sector experience. It was led by Mark Russell as Chief Executive at the time of its closure.  Role  The Shareholder Executive managed a portfolio of businesses with a combined turnover of around ¬£12 billion. The businesses varied and could be in the form of a limited company, public limited company, limited liability partnership, statutory corporation, trading fund, executive agency, non-departmental public body or non-ministerial government department. It advised the government on drafting parts of the Postal Services Act 2011 and worked on the privatisation of Royal Mail and the possible mutualisation of Post Office Ltd. It was also involved in establishing the UK Green Investment Bank, the Public Data Group and the British Business Bank. It was not responsible for the government's shares in UK banks, which were managed by UK Financial Investments (UKFI), or the government's property holdings, which were managed by the Government Property Unit (GPU).  History  The Shareholder Executive was originally established in September 2003 as part of the Cabinet Office. In 2004 it moved to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). In 2007 the National Audit Office published a report into the Shareholder Executive. This was broadly positive but had some misgivings about its location in the DTI. Following the split of the DTI in 2007, ShEX moved to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) and then to its successor, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) in 2009. The Shareholder Executive was originally involved in the government's nationalisation of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley at the start of the banking crisis in 2008. It then began the process of splitting off Northern Rock's 'bad bank' mortgage business to form Northern Rock. All bank shareholdings were transferred to UK Financial Investments in November 2008. In 2011 the Government Property Unit was moved from the Shareholder Executive to the Cabinet Office as part of the new Efficiency and Reform Group. In 2015, the government announced that the Shareholder Executive would be transferred to HM Treasury and became subsidiary of UK Government Investments, along with UK Financial Investments. This was due to occur with the end of the government fiscal year on 1 April 2016.  Portfolio Unit  The Portfolio Unit contains businesses where the Shareholder Executive have a shareholding mandate, although the shares themselves are owned by government departments. Its role is either accountable to ministers directly ('executive'), working alongside shareholding teams within departments ('joint team') or advising department shareholder teams ('advisory').

It is a tributary of the Los Angeles River, providing about a fifth of its flow, and drains about . It is called a wash because it is usually dry, especially the lower reaches, only carrying significant flows during and after storms, which usually only occur between November and April. The name of the wash derives from a Tongva village name. About The name Tujunga or Tuxunga means \\"old woman's place\\" in both Fernande√±o and Tongva, where Tuxu means \\"old woman\\". The term is thought to relate to an ethnohistoric narrative, known as Khra'wiyawi, collected by Carobeth Laird from Juan and Juana Menendez at the Leonis Adobe in 1916. In the narrative, the wife of Khra'wiyawi (the chief of the region) is stricken with grief over the untimely loss of her daughter. In her sadness, she retreats to the mountains and turns to stone. It is thought this event became the basis for the village name. King, Chester. Overview of the History of American Indians in the Santa Monica Mountains. Rep.

Prepared for the National Park Service Pacific West Region Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area In fact, there is a large rock in Little Tujunga Canyon which looks like an old woman in a sitting position. However, there was also a Fernande√±o village in the vicinity of Big Tujunga Canyon called Mux√∫nga, which means \\"place of shooting\\" in the Fernande√±o dialect of the Tongva language. The name comes from the verb mux√∫, which means \\"shoot him.\\" Tujunga Wash consists of two forks, both beginning in the San Gabriel Mountains. The upper portion of Big Tujunga Wash is called Tujunga Creek, or Big Tujunga Creek. It travels roughly east to west, and several tributaries from the north and south join it as it flows to Big Tujunga Reservoir, formed by Big Tujunga Dam. Below the dam, the stream is called Big Tujunga Wash. It continues its westward flow, enters San Fernando Valley and is met by Little Tujunga Wash a mile before reaching Hansen Reservoir, which is formed by Hansen Dam. Little Tujunga Wash comes from the north, draining the portion of the San Gabriel Mountains immediately north of Hansen Reservoir. Downstream of the dam, Tujunga Wash flows roughly south and is met halfway to its confluence with the Los Angeles River by Pacoima Wash, which drains the other side of the mountains that Little Tujunga Wash drains. Finally, Tujunga Wash meets the Los Angeles River near Studio City, California. Flooding damage along the wash in 1938 Big Tujunga Dam was built by Los Angeles County and completed in 1931. Big Tujunga Reservoir can hold of water. In the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 it was tested. The dam is currently undergoing a seismic retrofit, which includes doubling the thickness of the gravity arch dam. Hansen Dam was built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and completed in 1940. Hansen Reservoir can hold of water. Their primary purposes are flood control, although they also provide some groundwater recharge. Water cannot percolate in the lower portion of the watershed because it is so urbanized that there is little bare ground and streambeds have been transformed into concrete channels, and the water flows too fast in the upper reaches of the watershed to sink into the ground very much. As a result, the majority of the water is discharged into the ocean. In 1969 there was a flood in the Tujunga Wash: water flowed down a formerly inactive channel and entered a large gravel pit 15 m to 23 m deep. The channel bed degraded by about 4 meters, leading to failure of three highway bridges and loss of seven homes.Bull, W. B. and K. M.

She still clutches the dead body of her adopted-sister, Haani, who was killed by a nervous Aachim shooter. Her previous withdrawal, that caused her to madly desire the strange crystal Amplimet, which lies unguarded near the gate she created to bring the treacherous Aachim to Santhenar from dying Aachan, has evaporated in her grief for her sister. It is not long before Tiaan realises that she is being followed. Indeed, she is soon captured, by her nemesis from the manufacturory, Nish and a strange young woman by the name of Ullii. Tiaan escapes twice but is recaptured both times. However, as Nish bounds her after her second escape attempt, in which Tiaan nearly falls to her death in the Well of Echoes, he is interrupted by an old Aachim woman who states herself to be the Matah of Tirthrax. The Matah forces Nish to release Tiaan, humiliating him with a minor use of her powers. The Matah has Tiaan and Nish relate their story and becomes distressed at the knowledge of the Aachim invasion, led by Vithis. She speaks of the time of The Forbidding as if she were present. The Matah instructs Nish and Ullii to leave Tirthrax and warn their people of the Aachim invasion, though Nish had already sent word by skeet of what he had witnessed. The Matah befriends Tiaan and helps her to deliver Haani's body to the Well of Echoes, an honour befitted to only the greatest of people. The Matah reveals that she is in fact Malien, a heroine from the time of the Mirror. Tiaan decides to go and retrieve the amplimet from the gate room, but finds it missing. She originally accuses Malien, but they eventually realise that Nish is the only possible culprit. Later, Tiaan and Malien head for the balloon on the side of Tirthrax to retrieve the Amplimet and succeed. Nish and Ulii manage to repair and refloat the balloon and head off.

International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; accessed 25 August 2013. He was the local police chief in Knin at the time of Croatia's declaration of independence. In 1990, he took on the position of local Serb leader, organizing the Milicija Krajina militia also known as Martiƒá's Police. From 4 January 1991 to August 1995, Martiƒá held various leadership positions, including President, Minister of Defence, Minister of Internal Affairs, in Serbian Autonomous District (SAO) Krajina and the Republic of Serbian Krajina (both unrecognised). Also in 1991, Serbian opposition leader Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá claimed Martiƒá and Goran Had≈æiƒá had organized an assassination attempt on him. Martiƒá replied that this was \\"an ordinary stupidity\\" and that \\"if he were to organize an assassination attempt, he would go through with it.\\" Martiƒá was critical of Dra≈°koviƒá as Dra≈°koviƒá called against mobilization and called for desertion.Pogledi, 15 November 1991, issue 96, pg. 29 Martiƒá was supported by Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá during the 1993 presidential election in Serbian Krajina.

In a second round of voting in 1994 he was elected President and remained in power until the fall of Serbian Krajina during Croatia's Operation Storm in 1995. After the fall of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, Martiƒá and a large portion of the Serbian Krajina army and civilians, escaped to Banja Luka. Initially, he was rumored to have been either killed or wounded. He did not issue any statement for a number of days.Novine, 6 August 1995. Martiƒá went on to announce a plan of guerrilla warfare that would \\"last until the final freedom of the Republic of Serbian Krajina\\". Martiƒá said in a statement: =ICTY prosecution= Initially indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on 25 July 1995, Martiƒá surrendered on 15 May 2002, and was transferred to the tribunal in The Hague the same day. He was charged with murder, persecution, inhumane treatment, forced displacement, plunder of public or private property, and wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages. He pleaded not guilty to all counts. According to the ICTY, in the amended indictment, he \\"helped organize an ethnic cleansing campaign of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina and virtually the entire non-Serb population was forcibly removed, deported or killed\\". He was originally charged only with ordering a rocket attack on Zagreb which killed seven civilians as retaliation to Operation Flash. Two days later, in an interview, Martiƒá admitted he had personally ordered the shelling of the city.

It is a tributary of the Santa Clara River, the largest stream system in Southern California that is still relatively natural. The creek drains an area of about , making it the Santa Clara River's biggest tributary in terms of watershed size.U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map. Retrieved 2011-03-16. Most of the creek above Lake Piru is located in the Los Padres National Forest. There are two major reservoirs on Piru Creek, Lake Piru and Pyramid Lake, which respectively store water for local irrigation and the California State Water Project. Course Piru Creek originates as several small springs on the north side of Pine Mountain Ridge in the Santa Ynez Mountains, in the Los Padres National Forest. It flows eastwards through a gentle valley, where it is joined by Cedar Creek from the right. After the Cedar Creek confluence the stream turns northeast, receives Sheep Creek from the left, and Mutau Creek from the right. Piru Creek receives Lockwood Creek from the left at Sunset campground on Lockwood Flat, and flows east into a canyon where the valley walls pull in and rise steeper and higher above the river. The Smith Fork of Piru Creek, with headwaters in the San Emigdio Mountains, comes in from the left about south of Gorman. Piru Creek then turns sharply southeast and enters the Pyramid Lake reservoir impounded behind Pyramid Dam, which stores imported water from the West Branch of the California Aqueduct for Ventura County and Los Angeles County. Interstate 5 runs almost a above the east side of the reservoir/former canyon. Below Pyramid Dam, Piru Creek maintains a relatively constant flow due to releases of reservoir water. It turns south and flows through the Topatopa Mountains via the Piru Gorge and along old route of Hwy 99‚àíPyramid Dam Road, forming the boundary between Mount Pinos and Saugus Ranger Districts of the Los Padres National Forest and dropping over Piru Creek Falls.\\"The Definitive Guide to the Waterfalls of Southern and Central California\\", Chris Shaffer, 1997; . The creek flows south, still along the route of old Hwy 99‚àíPyramid Dam Road and through Cherry Canyon, to Frenchman's Flat and the confluence with Osito Creek (left). The creek turns sharply to the west entering another gorge, then south through it where it receives from the right Fish Creek of the northeastern Cobblestone Mountain watershed, ephemeral Turtle Creek (right) and Michael Creek (left), and then from the right Agua Blanca Creek of the western and southern Cobblestone Mountain watershed. It crosses the boundary between Los Angeles County and Ventura County five times before leaving the Los Padres National Forest and being impounded behind Santa Felicia Dam in Lake Piru, the second reservoir on the creek. Below this point the canyon widens and the creek becomes a wide gravelly wash. It reaches the Santa Clara River Valley at the town of Piru, and crosses under State Route 126 to join the Santa Clara River. History Thousands of years ago, Native Americans of the Chumash group lived in the area, but by 500 CE, their former territory along Piru Creek had been occupied by the Tataviam. It is believed that there were once up to 25 Native American villages on the creek, of which eight have been thoroughly studied. Spanish explorer Don Gaspar de Portol√° first traveled up the creek in 1769. In 1839, the Mexican government granted the Rancho San Francisco to Antonio del Valle. The Rancho Camulos was created out of Rancho San Francisco land by Ygnacio del Valle in 1853, and included parts of the valleys of Piru Creek and the Santa Clara River. In 1842, traces of gold were found on a nearby tributary of the Santa Clara River, Placerita Creek, drawing prospectors to the area. By the late 19th century, prospectors had discovered traces of calcite on Piru Creek in Lockwood Valley near Frazier Mountain, north of present-day Pyramid Lake. A town called Lexington was platted near the site in 1887 but was never actually developed. In the 1880s borax was also mined in the upper Piru Creek watershed by the Frazier Borate Company. The Frazier Borate Company established the town of Stauffer in the late 1890s. In 1905 the town received its own post office. However, the mines closed soon afterward and the town went into decline, though it was not abandoned completely until 1942. The Russell Borate Mining Company also acquired land in the Piru Creek area in 1907. By 1912, the Russell mine was the only one left in operation. Ultimately, all the mines were abandoned because of competitions from borax operations in Death Valley. Recreation Trailhead at end of Piru Canyon Road, entrance to lower Piru Creek trails. Hiking, camping, off-roading and rock climbing are some of the recreational opportunities in the Los Padres National Forest that surrounds much of the Piru's course. One well-known trail follows Piru Creek through the lower part of Piru Gorge from Frenchman's Flat to the confluence with Fish Creek, and it is possible to continue all the way south from there to Lake Piru with much scrambling and wading. The entire hike can require more than two days to complete, and flooding from Piru Creek is a potential danger. In the spring, the stretches of Piru Creek from Pyramid Lake to Lake Piru and from Santa Felicia Dam to the mouth are actually possible to raft and kayak. The first stretch has rapids up to Class IV and includes the challenging section known as Falls Gorge, while the calmer second reach has Class I-II rapids only. Controlled water releases from the two dams provide some regulation of the flow although an effort is made to simulate natural discharges. As a result, the section is usually only runnable after rainfall. From downstream of Pyramid Dam to the Los Angeles-Ventura County line, Piru Creek in various sections is designated a National Wild and Scenic River. =Fishing= At one time fishing along Piru Creek was a year-round activity. In the present day, the uppermost limit of natural fish spawning in the creek is below Pyramid Dam, where a cement culvert adjoining the remains of Highway 99 creates a waterfall. Piru Creek was once a popular spot for both fly fishing and bait-casting anglers as it contained both wild and hatchery-raised rainbow trout, along with largemouth bass. The creek is no longer stocked with trout by the California Department of Fish and Game and, due to lack of enforcement from the California Department of Fish and Game, frequent poaching of fish from the creek has reduced both the trout and bass population. Certain spots, posted as \\"catch and release\\" areas and restricted to fishing with barbless, artificial lures, are still somewhat active along a three-mile stretch of the creek from Pyramid Dam to Frenchman's Flat with the best conditions for fishing from January to April (limit of 5 fish per angler). The reach from Pyramid Dam to a small bridge downstream is closed to any fishing.

It is the motherhouse of the St. Ottilien Congregation, otherwise known as the Missionary Benedictines. Foundation In the 16th century a small castle was built at Emming, including a chapel dedicated to Saint Ottilia. Both castle and chapel were made over in the Baroque style in the 17th century. After several changes of owner, and the demolition of much of the castle in 1884, in 1886 the estate came into the possession of Andreas Amrhein, formerly a Benedictine from Beuron Archabbey. His vision of combining the Benedictine way of life with engagement in the Christian mission field had proved impossible to realise within the Beuronese Congregation, and for that reason he sought to found a new and independent group. After an initial foundation in Reichenbach am Regen in the district of Cham in 1884, the community moved to Emming in 1887, where the monastery took its name from the already existing chapel of Saint Ottilia. In 1886/1887 the adjunct Rhabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium St. Ottilien was founded as a school for young Benedictine monks and the first group of missionaries were sent to Africa the same year.  Development  In 1895 Andreas Amrhein resigned from the community, which then became a priory. In 1902 St. Ottilien was elevated to the status of an abbey. After the foundation of another three abbeys, St. Ottilien was chosen in 1914 as the archabbey of the St. Ottilien Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation, also known as the Missionary Benedictines. The Archabbot of St. Ottilien has ever since been ex officio the head of the St. Ottilien Congregation. The abbey grew rapidly until 1930, developing missions in South Africa, Korea and China. St. Ottilien was extended during this period in order to accommodate the expanding community, which grew to almost 400 people. In 1941 the abbey was suppressed by the Gestapo. The monks returned in 1945. From April 1945 until May 1948 the abbey served as a Displaced Persons (DP) camp to some 5,000 concentration camp survivors. The abbey continued to sponsor the Rhabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium St. Ottilien until 1973, when this task was handed over to the Diocese of Augsburg. Both institutions still keep close ties as a part of the administration and teaching staff of the school is held by Benedictine monks.  Buildings  The abbey church, dedicated to the Sacred Heart, was built between 1897 and 1899. Its pointed octagonal spire, 75 metres high, can be seen from a great distance around. In the bell tower hang eight bells, sounding one of the deepest tones in southern Germany . The three-aisled Neo-Gothic abbey church was consecrated in 1903. The mission museum, in the Art Nouveau sacristy to the south of the church, was opened in 1911. Over the years St. Ottilien has added many new facilities: a school (the Rhabanus Maurus Gymnasium), retreat- and guest- houses, a publishing house, workshops and buildings for farming and horticulture.

Bjorli is served by Bjorli Station on the Rauma Line (Raumabanen), providing a convenient method for tourists to reach this destination. A large restaurant was built in 1927 at the rail station to service passengers of cruise ships at the port at √Öndalsnes on Romsdalsfjord. It later burnt down and was not rebuilt. The major tourist attractions at Bjorli include: * Bjorli Ski Center, with early snow, 1 chair lift serving 660 m of vertical drop, and numerous cross-country trails. * Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella National Park's mountains make for spectacular hiking during the summer and skiing in the winter.

Etymology This toponymic surname may derive from prender from a Germanic word for fire or conflagration (cf. brand) where the b became p due to fortition and gast (cf. geest) from a germanic word for wasteland or dry and infertile land meaning the location could have been a burn-beat area. Others think the name is a Saxonized form of Bryn y Gest from the Welsh bryn meaning hill and gest a lenition of cest which means belly or swelling or a deep glen between two mountains having but one opening. It could also lessly come from Pren-dwr-gwest, the inn by the tree near the water. The right etymology is probably Pen-dre-gast. The suffix ast (cf. gast) is of druidic origin like for the cromlech chamber tomb of Penllech yr Ast (the chief slab of the bitch) or Llech-yr-ast (Bitch's stone), in Llangoedmor, Cardiganshire or Gw√¢l y Filiast (Lair of the Greyhound Bitch) or Carn Nant-yr-ast or Llety'r Filiast or Twlc y Filiast.

This is important for potentiometric measurements, including ion selective electrodes, because they measure the activity of the analyte rather than its concentration. TISAB essentially masks minor changes made in the ionic strength of the solution and hence increases the accuracy of the reading. Theory TISAB is very commonly applied to fluoride ion analysis such as in fluoride ion selective electrodes. There are four main constituents to TISAB, namely CDTA (cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetate), sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride and acetic acid (ethanoic acid), which are all dissolved in deionised water. Hence, TISAB has a density ~1.0 kg/L, though this can vary to 1.18 kg/L. Each constituent plays an important role in controlling the ionic strength and pH of the analyte solution, which may otherwise cause error and inaccuracy. The activity of a substance in solution depends on the product of its concentration and the activity coefficient in that solution. The activity coefficient depends on the ionic strength of the solution in which the potentiometric measurements are made. This can be calculated for dilute solutions using the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel equation; for more concentrated solutions other approximations must be used. In most cases, the analyst's goal is simply to make sure that the activity coefficient is constant across a set of solutions, with the assumption that no significant ion pairing exists in the solutions. Example: An ion-selective electrode might be calibrated using dilute solutions of the analyte in distilled water. If this calibration is used to calculate the concentration of the analyte in sea water (high ionic strength), significant error is introduced by the difference between the activity of the analyte in the dilute solutions and the concentrated sample. This can be avoided by adding a small amount of ionic-strength buffer to the standards, so that the activity coefficients match more closely. Adding a TISAB buffer to increase the ionic strength of the solution helps to \\"fix\\" the ionic strength at a stable level, making a linear correlation between the logarithm of the concentration of analyte and the measured voltage. By also adding the TISAB buffer to the samples from which the potentiometric equipment are calibrated, the linear correlation can be used to calculate the concentration of analyte in the solution. : E = K' + \\\\frac{RT}{nF} \\\\ln(c) where E is measured voltage, R is the gas constant, T the temperature measured in kelvins, F is the Faraday constant and n the charge of the analyte. c is the concentration of analyte. TISAB buffers often include chelators which bind ions that could otherwise interfere with the analyte.

With a height difference of between the upstream and downstream reaches, it was the tallest boat lift in the world upon its completion, and remained so until the Three Gorges Dam ship lift in China was completed in January 2016. History Downstream view The boat lift was designed during the Canal du Centre's modernisation program in order to replace a system of two locks and four lifts dating from 1888 to 1919. The canal itself began operations in 1879 and its locks and lifts were able to accommodate vessels of up to 300 tonnes. By the 1960s, this was no longer adequate for the new European standard of 1350 tonnes for barge traffic, and a replacement was sought. Construction of the lift commenced in 1982 and was not completed until 2002 at an estimated cost of ‚Ç¨160 million (then 6.4 billion BEF), but once operational, permitted river traffic of up to the new 1350-tonne standard to pass between the waterways of the Meuse and Scheldt rivers. The lift increased river traffic from 256 kT in 2001 to 2,295 kT in 2006. The four older lifts on the Canal du Centre, which became bypassed by the new Canal du Centre, are on the UNESCO World Heritage list, because of their architectural and historical value. Design Machine hall The structure at Str√©py-Thieu consists of two independent counterweighted caissons which travel vertically between the upstream and downstream sections. Because of Archimedes' Principle, the caissons weigh the same whether they are laden with a boat or simply contain water. In practice, variations in the water level mean that the mass of each caisson varies between 7200 and 8400 tonnes. The caissons have useful dimensions of and a water depth of between . Each caisson is supported by 112 suspension cables (for counterbalance) and 32 control cables (for lifting/lowering), each of diameter. The mass of the counterbalance was calculated to keep the tension in each of the control cables below at all times. The suspension cables pass over idler pulleys with a diameter of . Four electric motors power eight winches per caisson via speed-reduction gearboxes and the lift is completed in seven minutes. The structure is massively reinforced to provide rigidity against torsional forces during operation and has a mass of approximately 200,000 tonnes. The vertically moving watertight gates are designed to withstand a impact from a 2000-tonne vessel. The boat lift is promoted as a tourist attraction in its own right by the government of Hainaut. A pedestrian ticket for a one-way ride on the lift costs ‚Ç¨5.50.

It was seen as an alternative route for Russian oil, bypassing the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. However, in December 2011 the project was suspended by the Bulgarian government due to environmental and supply concerns. History The pipeline project was proposed in 1993‚Äì1994 by several Russian and Greek companies. In 1994, for construction of the pipeline Greece and Bulgaria signed a bilateral agreement, followed by a memorandum of cooperation, signed by Greece and Russia. In February 1998, a Greek consortium for pipeline construction named Bapline was established, and in May 1998, a memorandum of creation of the Transbalkan Oil Pipeline Company was signed. In 2000, a technical specifications and an economic evaluation of the project were prepared by the German company ILF. A joint protocol for preparing the pipeline's construction was signed by the three countries in January 2005. The political memorandum between governments was signed on 12 April 2005. An inter-governmental agreement on the project was agreed on 7 February 2007, and it was signed on 15 March 2007 in Athens, by the relevant ministers of the three countries, in the presence of their leaders, Vladimir Putin (Russian president), Sergey Stanishev (Bulgarian prime-minister), and Kostas Karamanlis (prime-minister of Greece). The agreement establishing the international project company was signed in Moscow on 18 December 2007 and the company‚ÄîTrans-Balkan Pipeline B.V.‚Äîwas incorporated in the Netherlands on 6 February 2008. Construction of the pipeline was scheduled to start in October 2009, and was estimated to be completed by 2011. However, the project was delayed as the Bulgarian government coming to power in July 2009 started to reconsider its participation in the project. On 19 October 2009, Italy, Russia and Turkey signed an inter-governmental agreement agreeing the participation of Russian oil companies in the competing Samsun-Ceyhan pipeline project. On 11 June 2010, Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borisov announced that Bulgaria would not participate in the project to due strong opposition from the local population of Burgas. Later it was said that the government would await an environmental impact assessment before making a final decision about termination of the project. On 7 December 2011, the Bulgarian government officially decided to terminate its participation in the project and proposed that the tripartite inter-governmental agreement be terminated by mutual consent. Technical features and financing The main pipeline with a diameter of would be long, and it would transport 15-23 million tons of oil per year during the first phase, as well as 35 million during the second. The pipeline would have three oil refilling stations, two of which in Bulgaria (the first one at Neftochim close to Burgas) and one at Alexandroupoli. The project included reconstruction of Burgas and Alexandroupolis terminals, including oil tanks with a capacity of 600,000 tons in Burgas, and 1,200,000 tons in Alexandroupolis. The pipeline was expected to cost up to ‚Ç¨1 billion. The investment scheme was not agreed, and it was not decided from which sources the pipeline would be filled. International project company The pipeline was to be constructed and owned by the Dutch-registered Trans-Balkan Pipeline B.V. In this company, a stake of 51% of shares belongs to the Burgas‚ÄìAlexandroupolis Pipeline Consortium, a joint venture of Russian Transneft, Rosneft and Gazprom Neft. Bulgarian Burgas‚ÄìAlexandroupolis Project Company-BG, a subsidiary of Technoexportstroy, owns 24.5% of shares. Greece consortium HELPE S.A. - THRAKI S.A., a joint venture between Hellenic Petroleum and Thraki, which is owned by Prometheus Gas and the Latsis Group, owns 23.5%, while the Government of Greece has 1%. There were speculations that the part of Bulgarian and Hellenic stakes could be sold to other oil companies as Chevron, TNK-BP and KazMunayGas. Also Andrei Dementyev, a deputy industry and energy minister of Russia, has proposed that Kazakhstani KazMunayGas and other shareholders of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium could get a stake in the project. Kazakhstan's Energy Minister Baktykozha Izmukhambetov had said that Kazakhstan wants to buy a stake in the pipeline consortium. Controversy There were several competitive pipeline projects, such as the AMBO pipeline from Burgas to Vlor√´, Pan-European Pipeline from Constan≈£a to Trieste, Odessa-Brody-Plotsk pipeline, Kiykoy-Ibrice pipeline, and Samsun-Ceyhan pipeline ‚Äî all aimed to transport oil from the Black Sea bypassing Turkish straits. The project of the Burgas‚ÄìAlexandroupoli pipeline was described as one of the shortest pipeline through a plain terrain and therefore to be one of the cheapest and cost effective. The critics of the Burgas‚ÄìAlexandroupoli pipeline project raised environmental concerns because of oil tankers traffic in the Aegean Sea, which contains numerous submerged rocks and island populations dependent on tourism and fishing. It has been mentioned that a possible oil spill in the Aegean would be devastating for Greece's tourism industry. The residents of Burgas and Sozopol in Bulgaria voted against in the pipeline in local referendums in the spring of 2008.

In computer security, a chain of trust is established by validating each component of hardware and software from the end entity up to the root certificate. It is intended to ensure that only trusted software and hardware can be used while still retaining flexibility. Introduction A chain of trust is designed to allow multiple users to create and use software on the system, which would be more difficult if all the keys were stored directly in hardware. It starts with hardware that will only boot from software that is digitally signed. The signing authority will only sign boot programs that enforce security, such as only running programs that are themselves signed, or only allowing signed code to have access to certain features of the machine. This process may continue for several layers. This process results in a chain of trust. The final software can be trusted to have certain properties, because if it had been illegally modified its signature would be invalid, and the previous software would not have executed it. The previous software can be trusted, because it, in turn, would not have been loaded if its signature had been invalid. The trustworthiness of each layer is guaranteed by the one before, back to the trust anchor. It would be possible to have the hardware check the suitability (signature) for every single piece of software. However, this would not produce the flexibility that a \\"chain\\" provides. In a chain, any given link can be replaced with a different version to provide different properties, without having to go all the way back to the trust anchor. This use of multiple layers is an application of a general technique to improve scalability, and is analogous to the use of multiple certificates in a certificate chain. Computer security In computer security, digital certificates are verified using a chain of trust. The trust anchor for the digital certificate is the root certificate authority (CA). The certificate hierarchy is a structure of certificates that allows individuals to verify the validity of a certificate's issuer. Certificates are issued and signed by certificates that reside higher in the certificate hierarchy, so the validity and trustworthiness of a given certificate is determined by the corresponding validity of the certificate that signed it. The chain of trust of a certificate chain is an ordered list of certificates, containing an end-user subscriber certificate and intermediate certificates (that represents the intermediate CA), that enables the receiver to verify that the sender and all intermediate certificates are trustworthy. This process is best described in the page Intermediate certificate authority. See also X.509 certificate chains for a description of these concepts in a widely used standard for digital certificates.

Leung responded to the call alone as his partner was still having lunch. His final radio call was received at 12:25 when he reported that he had arrived at the flat and nobody was responding to his knocks. He was subsequently attacked, struggling with his assailant to prevent his revolver being snatched, but was shot five times at close range. Leung took three bullets in the head and two in the back at Flat 552, Shek To House Block B. Under police guard, paramedics wearing bulletproof vests rushed Leung to Yan Chai Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. His revolver, a fully loaded Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolver, a speedloader, and one extra clip of six bullets were missing. The noise complaint was apparently bogus, and was made from an untraceable mobile phone. The police suspected that the officer was lured to the scene for his gun.

At 12:10, masked and alone, he burst into the bank. Watchman Zafar Iqbal Khan, aged 31, struggled with the man. He was shot three times, in the head, body and wrist, and died instantly. The assailant jumped over the counter and snatched money, fleeing with HK$490,000 as well as US$1,000. He fled onto Castle Peak Road and then into the Belvedere Garden shopping arcade, escaping through another exit. Police evacuated the shopping centre and launched a manhunt but failed to catch the robber. The police located several domestic helpers who witnessed the robber removing his balaclava following the crime. With their help the police produced a facial composite image of the suspect that was distributed to frontline officers. The perpetrator was described as a man with short hair and about 1.8 m tall, whom Assistant Police Commissioner Yam described as a \\"calm, cold-blooded and brutal robber\\". A HK$2 million reward was issued.Eddie Luk, $2m reward for bank killer info , The Standard, 12 December 2001 Immediately following the robbery the police noted that the murder weapon appeared to be a police service revolver. Later on, it was revealed that Tsui matched the description of the perpetrator as captured on closed circuit television; key pieces of evidence were a red T-shirt, Mizuno brand shoes and the fact that footage showed the killer to be a left- handed gunman. He was placed near the scene by the police: Tsui boarded a bus from Yat Tung Estate in Tung Chung at 11:11 using the Octopus card issued to his wife; it was clocked in a minibus heading to Tsuen Wan at 11:53.Una So, Octopus card pieces together Tsui's movements , The Standard, 13 April 2007 A red T-shirt carrying a similar distinctive logo as captured on CCTV was found at Tsui's home after his death. The T-shirt, bearing the logo of the Yinchuan International Motor-cycle Travel Festival was a gift to Tsui by the club secretary during his visit to the show in 2000. An expert witness identified the T-shirt as having been worn inside-out during the robbery.„ÄåÂæêÊ≠•È´òÁ•ûÁßòÁ¥ÖË°£ÂØßÂ§èÂ∞ãÊ∫ê ‰∏âËßíÊ®ôË™åËàáÂä´Âå™Á¥ÖË°£Áõ∏‰ºº Ë≠¶ÂçÉÈáåËøΩÊü•„Äç„ÄäÊòéÂ†±„ÄãÔºå2007Âπ¥3Êúà15Êó• Ballistics identified the gun used in the robbery as having been a police service revolver taken from murdered police officer Leung Shing-yan. Zafar Iqbal Khan was a father of four who lived with his brothers in Kwai Chung. His wife and children lived in Pakistan. During the robbery he cocked his Remington shotgun after being shot twice but did not have a chance to fire his weapon before being killed. A ceremony, attended by his relatives, friends, and bank chairman Vincent Cheng, was held at the Kowloon Mosque on 7 December before his body was returned to Pakistan later in the day. 3 Khan was posthumously awarded the Medal for Bravery (Gold) for \\"selfless bravery of the highest order\\", which was accepted on his behalf by his wife. =Financial irregularities= An investigation by the Criminal Intelligence Bureau into Tsui's financial status from January 2000 to March 2006 revealed he had a total of 19 personal banking and investment accounts hidden from his wife. Total assets were HK$2,977,513.Una So, Slain cop had assets worth nearly $3m , The Standard, 11 April 2007 Seven personal and 12 investment accounts were opened under his name around mid-February in 2002, using a friend's address. Between February 2002 and October 2004, Tsui deposited HK$557,718 into the 19 accounts which could not be accounted for. All transactions were in cash. It was reported that Tsui was active in foreign exchange market, commodities, securities, funds, and margin trading, and had lost a total of HK$371,982 in those investments. Tsui and his wife bought one flat in August 1997, and paid HK$574,800 in cash. Two years later, he bought a flat at Tung Chung Crescent with a HK$396,173 down payment, paying monthly instalments of HK$17,778 for a first and a second mortgage. The mortgages were paid off in just five years, HK$388,151 in 2001 and HK$500,000 in 2004. The police alleged that the transactions were inconsistent with a constable's salary, and that the HK$500,000 unexplained cash would be consistent with the bank's loss during the heist in 2001. =Subway ambush= The pedestrian subway where the shootout took place Tsui was also responsible for ambushing two police officers in a Tsim Sha Tsui pedestrian subway, triggering a shoot- out on 17 March 2006. 28-year-old Constable Sin Ka-keung (), survivor of the shoot-out, said that he and 33-year-old Constable Tsang Kwok-hang () were ambushed in the underpass at the junction of Austin and Canton Roads. PC Sin had seen a man lurking on the northern stairs of the subway and attempted to confront him before he was shot in the face. The attacker then proceeded to shoot PC Tsang. PC Tsang was shot in the head, while PC Sin sustained gunshot wounds in the face and leg. Upon doing so, PC Sin got up and attempted to draw his pistol. The attacker then tried to snatch his revolver. Tsui had started the exchange. PC Sin returned two shots, but missed.Andrea Chiu, Rogue cop planned ambush, say police , The Standard, 21 March 2006 PC Sin then grappled with the man and fired two shots before both of them slumped to the floor. PC Tsang was able to get up and shoot Tsui five times in the torso killing him before he later succumbed to his own wounds. The police confirmed that the rusty revolver found beside Tsui's body to be the gun stolen from the late PC Leung in 2001. PC Sin was awarded the Medal for Bravery (Gold) for his actions and wrote a book about his experience.http://www.police.gov.hk/offbeat/1011/eng/1303.htmlhttps://m.scmp.com/news/hong- kong/article/1436571/policeman-who-survived-sensational-2006-devil-cop-shoot- out-launches%3famp=1 Mental state As the inquiry continued, Tsui was found to be an ambitious officer who often topped his class and did well in assessment tests. However, he was often denied promotions or opportunities to join elite units, such as the Airport Security Unit.Slain officer had major ambitions, The Standard, 27 March 2007 He was not media shy, as was demonstrated by his appearance on a television game show. He was happily photographed when he won the chance to buy his flat in a draw. He was again happy to be photographed during the democracy rally on 1 July 2004 dressed in traditional Chinese funeral style (\\"Êä´È∫ªÊà¥Â≠ù\\").'High profile participation in march as a challenge to the Government' (Article with photo), The SunÔºå22 March 2006, Retrieved 7 July 2007 An associate professor of social science at the City University of Hong Kong suggested that Tsui, like many criminals, did not know how to face frustration, and chose instead to take an illegal path in obtaining socially approved goals, such as money, prestige or recognition. It was suggested that the police force should pay more attention to talented officers who fail to gain promotion, and recommended that there should be independent and confidential psychological counselling services for such troubled or frustrated officers. A Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal profiler believed that Tsui's behaviour fit into most of the definitions of schizotypal personality disorder, while an expert from the Queensland University of Technology said Tsui's personality profile matched that of a serial killer who believed he was destined to change the world, probably tried to rise above his self-perceived unremarkable life by playing God, by taking lives.

It started broadcasting by satellite in 1990 and, since 1992, on terrestrial television. In 1994, TV4 became the largest channel and remained so for a number of years. The two channels of Sveriges Television (SVT) lost more and more viewers for a couple of years. After making schedule changes in 2001, SVT1 had practically the same numbers of viewers as TV4. From 2004 to 2019, the TV4 Group was a fully active member of the European Broadcasting Union. History TV4 was launched on 15 September 1990. The channel invested in an extensive news organisation and Swedish drama series. The premiere suffered from technical faults and the drama series weren't popular with critics. In 1991, two of the channels oldest entertainment programmes premiered: the Swedish version of Jeopardy! and the Saturday night bingo show Bingolotto. Bingolotto in particular became highly popular. This year also saw TV4 awarded a license to broadcast terrestrially. Terrestrial broadcasts started on 2 March 1992. During this year, Nyhetsmorgon started and marked the introduction of weekday breakfast television in Sweden. During the 1990s TV4 would broadcast several popular Friday night entertainment shows such as F√•ngarna p√• fortet (Swedish version of Fort Boyard), K√§r och galen, Tur i k√§rlek, P√• rymmen, Sikta mot stj√§rnorna (Soundmix Show), Stadskampen, (Intervilles) and Sm√•stj√§rnorna (Mini Playback Show). They have also broadcast several home-grown sitcoms such as Rena Rama Rolf and En fyra f√∂r tre as well as the soap opera Tre kronor. In the early 1990s, the TV4 Group decided to move their 7pm evening news to 7:30pm in order to compete with the most popular news programme, Rapport, which, at that time, was broadcast on SVT2. This failed and the news was subsequently moved to 6:30pm. In 2004, the evening news was moved to 7pm, and the status quo reinstated. In 2004, TV4 began transitioning to become a digital-only service, starting by shutting down its analogue satellite signal.TV4-Gruppen har avvecklat den analoga satelliten On 19 September 2005, TV4 began shutting down analogue terrestrial transmissions, starting at the island of Gotland. The analogue shutoff was completed by October 2007. Since 2004, TV4 has been broadcasting a Swedish version of the internationally popular Pop Idol format. In July 2018 it was announced that Bonnier Broadcasting would be acquired by Telia Company for 9.2 billion SEK, thus making Telia the new owner of TV4. The acquisition was completed on 2 December 2019. Programming TV4 offers a mix of news, sports, drama series, soaps, entertainment, current affairs programmes, sitcoms, feature films, documentaries and phone-in shows. News is an important part of TV4. It broadcasts the news program Nyheterna, (The News) at 7pm & 10pm and Nyhetsmorgon (News Morning) in the mornings. On weekend mornings there is children's programming in Swedish before Nyhetsmorgon starts. After 11pm until Nyhetsmorgon, it shows reruns and some Swedish and English television series. TV4 Official Fan Zone in Stockholm during UEFA EURO 2012 After the Nyhetsmorgon ends on weekdays the Efter tio (After ten) starts followed by English spoken TV series up until the news at 7pm. In the daytime on weekends there are often reruns and sports programs. Then main Swedish and English TV programs are broadcast up to the 10pm news. Friday nights have included family entertainment at 8pm since the early 1990s. Bingolotto occupied Saturday evenings from 1991 to 2004. TV4 then moved Bingolotto to Sundays and started broadcasting feature films instead. With the start of Deal or No Deal in 2006, family entertainment returned to Saturday nights. Later, there are other entertainment shows on Saturday evenings. On Sunday evenings, Swedish-produced television programs are shown until 9pm when they show a movie on Saturday nights. They also show a movie after the entertainment show. After about 11pm until Nyhetsmorgon starts they show reruns and some Swedish and English television series. The foreign programs are mainly from the UK and USA. All foreign programmes, as well as segments of local programmes with foreign language content (e.g. news interviews), are subtitled into Swedish. TV4 also offers investigative journalism programmes, most notably Kalla fakta (\\"Cold Facts\\"). =Regional stations= As a part of its public service obligations, TV4 owns and operates a number of regional and local opt-out stations. When the local stations were set up, they were owned by both local investors and the TV4 Group themselves. Since the start of TV4 Uppland in 1996, the number of stations has been sixteen. Although some stations have closed and others have been set up, the total number of stations has stayed unchanged. The TV4 Group brought out many of the local stations and became the sole owner of fifteen stations in 2001. The only independent station, TV4 Fyrstad, went bankrupt in 2003 and was replaced by TV4 V√§st, owned and operated by the TV4 Group. The TV4 Group later merged the stations into five regional companies and in 2004, a single company: TV4 Sverige AB. , these are the local TV4 stations: *TV4 V√§rmland (V√§rmland) *TV4 V√§st (\\"West\\") *TV4 G√∂teborg (Gothenburg) *TV4 Halland (Halland) *TV4 √ñresund (The Sound) *TV4 Sydost (\\"Southeast\\") *TV4 J√∂nk√∂ping (J√∂nk√∂ping) *TV4 Skaraborg (Skaraborg County) *TV4 √ñst (\\"East\\") *TV4 Stockholm (Stockholm) *TV4 M√§lardalen (M√§laren Valley) *TV4 Uppland (Uppland) *TV4 G√§vle Dalarna (G√§vle and Dalarna) *TV4 Mitt (\\"Central\\") *TV4 V√§sterbotten (West Bothnia) *TV4 Norrbotten (North Bothnia) After the closedown of the analogue transmitters and the termination of TV4's public service obligations, the pattern of the local stations is due to a major overhaul which will see the number of local stations increase. TV4 Play and C More TV4 Play is the brand used for the video on demand service offered by the TV4 Group (Sweden), more specifically to the streaming services offered on the TV4 Play website, www.tv4play.se. Content on TV4 Play usually comes with advertisements, but users can watch the same content without advertisements on the subscription-based C More platform, which also provides a livestream of TV4 and its sister channels. Jurisdiction As TV4 is broadcast from Sweden, it has to follow much tighter advertising rules than its main competitors, Nordic Entertainment Group (TV3) and Discovery Communications Nordic (Kanal 5). Initially this meant that the TV4 Group was not allowed to include advertising breaks, meaning that the advertising had to be put in between the programmes. Nonetheless, the TV4 Group felt the urge to include advertising breaks. Therefore, it made several Inf√∂r programmes. The Inf√∂r programmes were short versions of TV4 programmes that were scheduled in the middle of programmes. For example, F√•ngarna p√• fortet would be divided into two parts and in between these, Inf√∂r Bingolotto would be shown. This allowed TV4 to broadcast advertising in the gaps between Inf√∂r Bingolotto and the two halves of F√•ngarna p√• fortet. The Broadcasting Commission repeatedly ruled that the Inf√∂r programmes couldn't be considered as real programmes. In 2000 they were replaced by a programme called Dagens namn, in which the current name day was mentioned. This was later on replaced by Om en bok in which famous people presented a book they enjoyed. This ended in April 2002 when a new Radio and TV Law came into force, allowing the TV4 Group to interrupt its programmes for advertising, but not to the same extent as TV3 and Kanal 5. The Radio and TV Law also restricted the amount of advertising that can be shown to ten percent of the programming. Since TV4 was the only commercial channel allowed to broadcast terrestrially, it had to pay a special fee to the government, consisting of a fixed fee and a variable element based on the amount of advertising that the TV4 Group sells. The TV4 Group worked to have this fee removed, especially with the launch of digital terrestrial television. The centre-right Reinfeldt Cabinet intended to relax the advertising rules. TV4 would then broadcast up to twelve minutes of advertising (as opposed to the previous ten minutes in prime time and eight minutes during other time). The amount of advertising overall would also raise from ten percent to fifteen percent, giving TV4 the same rules as the UK-based broadcasters.Annonstid i radio och TV , Swedish Ministry of Culture Personalities * Adam Alsing * Agneta Sj√∂din * Bengt Magnusson * David Hellenius * Jessica Almen√§s * Linda Isacsson * Martin Timell * Peter Eng * Peter Jihde * Yvonne Ryding References External links *Official site *TV4 TV Guide Category:Television channels in Sweden Category:Television channels and stations established in 1990 Category:TV4 AB Category:European Broadcasting Union members Category:1990 establishments in Sweden ","title":"TV4 (Sweden)"},{"id":"5044491","text":"The Sharp PC-5000 was a pioneering laptop computer, announced by Sharp Corporation of Japan in 1983.Sharp PC-5000, Old ComputersJapanese PCs (1984) (13:13), Computer Chronicles It employed a clamshell design in which the display closes over the keyboard, like the earlier GRiD Compass and contemporary Gavilan SC.

When Germany invaded Hungary too in March 1944, Brand became known for his efforts to save the Jewish community from deportation to the Auschwitz concentration camp in occupied Poland and the gas chamber.. In April 1944 Brand was approached by SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Adolf Eichmann, head of the German Reich Security Head Office department IV B4 (Jewish affairs), who had arrived in Budapest to organize the deportations. Eichmann proposed that Brand broker a deal between the SS and the United States or Britain, in which the Nazis would exchange one million Jews for 10,000 trucks for the Eastern front and large quantities of tea and other goods. It was the most ambitious of a series of proposals between the SS and Jewish leaders. Eichmann called it \\"Blut gegen Waren\\" (\\"blood for goods\\"). Nothing came of the idea, which The Times of London called one of the most loathsome stories of the war. Historians have suggested that the SS, including its commander, Reichsf√ºhrer- SS Heinrich Himmler, intended the negotiations as cover for peace talks with the Western Allies that would have excluded the Soviet Union and perhaps even Adolf Hitler. Whatever its purpose, the proposal was thwarted by the British government. They arrested Brand in Aleppo (then under British control), where he had gone to propose Eichmann's offer to the Jewish Agency, and put an end to it by leaking details to the media.; . The failure of the proposal, and the wider issue of why the Allies were unable to save the 437,000 Hungarian Jews deported to Auschwitz between May and July 1944, became the subject of bitter debate for many years. In 1961 Life magazine called Brand \\"a man who lives in the shadows with a broken heart\\". He told an interviewer shortly before his death in 1964: \\"An accident of life placed the fate of one million human beings on my shoulders. I eat and sleep and think only of them.\\"\\"Joel Brand, 58, Hungarian Jew In Eichmann's Truck Deal, Dies\\". The New York Times, 15 July 1964. Background =Early life= German-occupied Europe, 1942 One of seven children, Brand was born to a Jewish family in Nasz√≥d, Siebenb√ºrgen (Transylvania), then part of Austria-Hungary, later NƒÉsƒÉud, Romania. His father was the founder of the Budapest telephone company, and his paternal grandfather, also Joel Brand, had owned the post office in Mukacheve.. The family moved to Erfurt in Germany when Brand was four. When he was 19 he went to stay with an uncle in New York, then worked his way across the United States, washing dishes and working on roads and in mines. He joined the Communist Party, worked for the Comintern as a sailor, and sailed to Hawaii, the Philippines, South America, China, and Japan. In or around 1930 Brand returned to Erfurt, where he worked for another telephone company his father had founded and became a functionary with the Thuringian KPD (Communist Party of Germany). He was still living in Germany when Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor on 30 January 1933, and on 27 February that year he was arrested, as a communist, just before the Reichstag fire. Released in 1934, he moved to Budapest, Hungary, where he worked again for his father's company.; ; . He joined the Poale Zion, a Marxist-Zionist party, became a vice-president of the Budapest Palestine Office, which organized Jewish emigration to Palestine, and sat on the governing body of the Jewish National Fund.. =Aid and Rescue Committee= Oskar Schindler and Hansi Brand, mid-1960s In 1935 Brand married Haynalka \\"Hansi\\" Hartmann and together they opened a knitwear and glove factory on Rozsa Street, Budapest, which after a few years had a staff of over 100. The couple had met as members of a hachscharah, a group of Jews preparing to move to Palestine to work on a kibbutz, but Brand's plans changed when his mother and three sisters fled to Budapest from Germany and he had to support them.; . Brand's involvement in smuggling Jews into Hungary began in July 1941, when Hansi Brand's sister and brother-in-law, Lajos Stern, were caught up in the Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre. Because of the situation in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland, 15,000‚Äì35,000 Jews had fled to Hungary, registering with the National Central Alien Control Office. The Hungarian government expelled 18,000 of this group to German-occupied Ukraine, where on 27‚Äì28 August 1941, the SS and Ukrainian collaborators shot 14,000‚Äì16,000 of them. About 2,000 survived. Brand paid a Hungarian counter-espionage officer to bring his wife's relatives back safely.; . The Hungarian Interior Minister was reportedly shocked when he learned about the massacre, and the deportations were halted. Through the Poale Zion party, the Brands joined other Zionists engaged in rescue work, including Rezs≈ë Kasztner, a lawyer and journalist from Kolozsv√°r (Cluj, Transylvania), and Ott√≥ Komoly, an engineer. In January 1943 the group set up the Aid and Rescue Committee, known as the Va'adat Ha-Ezrah ve'Hatzalah or Va'ada, with Komoly as chair.; also see ; for January 1943, and . Other members included Andreas Biss (Brand's cousin), Samuel Springmann (a Polish jeweller whose family were in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ghetto), Sandor Offenbach, Dr. Miklos Schweiziger, Moshe Krausz, Eugen Frankel, and Ern≈ë Szil√°gyi from the Hashomer Hatzair party. The Va'ada raised money, forged documents, maintained contacts with intelligence agencies, and ran safe houses.. Brand testified during Adolf Eichmann's trial that, between 1941 and the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944, he and the committee had helped 22,000‚Äì25,000 Jews reach Hungary. Oskar Schindler became one of the committee's contacts, smuggling letters and money into the Krak√≥w ghetto on their behalf.; Crowe 2007, p. 295. During a visit by Schindler to Budapest in November 1943, they learned that Schindler had been bribing Nazi officers to let him bring Jewish refugees into his factory in Poland, which he ran as a safe haven. This further encouraged the committee, after the invasion of Hungary, to try negotiating with the SS.. March ‚Äì May 1944 =Invasion of Hungary= Auschwitz II gatehouse from inside the camp. The tracks were completed in 1944 to take the Hungarian Jews straight to the gas chambers in crematoria II and III. When the Germans invaded Hungary on Sunday, 19 March 1944, they were accompanied by a Sonderkommando led by SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Adolf Eichmann, head of the Reich Security Head Office department IV B4 (Jewish affairs). Eichmann's arrival in Budapest signalled the Germans' intention to \\"solve\\" Hungary's Jewish question.. Following Hungary's annexation in 1941 of parts of Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, there were 725,000 Jews in the country, as well as over 60,000 Jewish converts to Christianity and others the Nazis counted as Jews, according to Yehuda Bauer. Most were liberal Jews and fully assimilated, nearly 30 percent were Orthodox, and a small minority were Zionists.. Randolph Braham writes that Jews were viewed with suspicion in Hungary as advocates for democracy, liberalism, socialism and communism. Restrictions had been in place before the invasion, including a prohibition on marrying Christians; according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Hungarian Parliament passed 22 antisemitic laws between May 1938 and March 1944.\\"Museum Condemns Attempts to Rehabilitate Hungarian Fascist Leader\\". United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 28 June 2017. The Jewish leadership in Hungary was aware of the mass murder of Jews in occupied Europe, but the rest of the Jewish community was not, in Braham's view; he writes that the leadership's failure to inform the community and to plan for Hungary's occupation is \\"one of the great tragedies of the era\\". After the invasion, the Hungarian government began isolating Jews from the rest of the community. From 5 April 1944 Jews over the age of six had to wear a 3.8 x 3.8 inch (10 x 10 cm) yellow badge. Jews were forbidden from using telephones, owning cars or radios, travelling or moving home, and had to declare the value of their property. Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked, and non- Jews could not work in Jewish households. Books by Jews or Christians with Jewish heritage were removed from libraries, and Jewish authors could no longer be published. =Meeting with Wisliceny= Rezs≈ë Kasztner On the day of the invasion, Kasztner and Szil√°gyi hid in the apartment of Andreas Biss, a chemical engineer, in Semsey Street, Budapest. They were later joined by Komoly and his wife, and the Brands and their two children.. Wanting to establish contact with the Germans, the committee offered a go-between $20,000 to arrange a meeting with SS Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Dieter Wisliceny, one of Eichmann's assistants.. David Crowe writes that the SS had become an economic force in its own right by 1944, as a result its plundering of Jewish businesses and its ownership of factories relying on slave labour from concentration camps.. Jewish rescue workers had made several attempts to exploit SS corruption. In Bratislava, Slovakia, Gisi Fleischmann and Orthodox Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl, leaders of the Working Group (a group within the Slovakian Jewish Council that served as the equivalent of the Aid and Rescue Committee), had paid Dieter Wisliceny c. $50,000 in 1942 to suspend the deportation to Poland of Jews from Slovakia.; . According to Bauer, only two transports left for Poland after Wisliceny was paid, and the Working Group believed their bribe had succeeded.. In fact, the deportations had been halted for other reasons: Slovakian officials had been bribed; many Jews were protected by government documents showing they were, for example, essential workers; and there had been an intervention from the Vatican in June 1942.; also see and . Encouraged by their apparent success, Fleischmann and Weissmandl devised a more ambitious proposal in November 1942. Known as the Europa Plan or Grossplan, the aim was to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland.; . Nothing came of the proposal, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened to stop it in August 1943.. The Aid and Rescue Committee decided to ask Wisliceny whether the SS were, as Kasztner wrote in a later report, \\"prepared to negotiate with the illegal Jewish rescue committee on an economic basis about the moderation of the anti-Jewish measures\\".. Brand and Kasztner met Wisliceny on 5 April 1944. They told him they were in a position to continue Fleischmann's negotiations and could offer $2 million, with a down payment of $200,000. They asked that there be no deportations, mass executions or pogroms in Hungary, no ghettos or camps, and that Jews who held immigration certificates for Palestine (issued by the British mandatory government) be allowed to leave. Wisliceny accepted the $200,000, but indicated that $2 million might not be enough. He said there would be no deportations and no harm to the Jewish community while negotiations continued, and arranged for Aid and Rescue Committee exemptions from anti-Jewish laws to allow its members to travel and use cars and telephones.; . =First meeting with Eichmann = Adolf Eichmann, c. 1942\\\\. \\"Eichmann, resplendent in his SS uniform, stood in front of his desk and started barking at Brand: 'You ... do you know who I am?\\" Following the contact with Wisliceny, Brand received a message on 25 April that Eichmann wanted to see him.. Brand was told to wait in the Opera Caf√© and from there was driven by the SS to Eichmann's headquarters at the Hotel Majestic.. SS Untersturmbannf√ºhrer Kurt Becher, an emissary of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, was also at the meeting.. Brand wrote that Eichmann wore a \\"well-cut\\" uniform and had eyes he would never forget: \\"Steely blue, hard and sharp, they seemed to bore through you. ... It was only later that I noticed his small face with its thin lips and sharp nose.\\" In a tone that Brand compared to the \\"clatter of a machine gun\\", Eichmann offered to sell him one million Jews, not for money, but for goods from overseas:. > I have already made investigations about you and your people and I have > verified your ability to make a deal. Now then, I am prepared to sell you > one million Jews ... Goods for blood ‚Äì blood for goods. You can take them > from any country you like, wherever you can find them ‚Äì Hungary, Poland, the > Ostmark, from Theresienstadt, from Auschwitz, wherever you like.; also see . Eichmann said he would discuss the proposal with Berlin, and that in the meantime Brand should decide what kinds of goods he was in a position to offer. When Brand asked how the committee was supposed to obtain these goods, Eichmann suggested that Brand open negotiations with the Allies overseas; Eichmann said he would arrange a travel permit. Another member of the Va'ada had a Jewish Agency contact in Istanbul, so Brand suggested he would travel there. He testified years later that on leaving the hotel he felt like a \\"stark madman\\".; for \\"stark madman\\", see . =Further meetings= Eichmann sent for Brand again a few days later. Eichmann was accompanied this time by Gerhard Clages, also known as Otto Klages, chief of Himmler's Sicherheitsdienst (security service) in Budapest. Clages' presence meant that three of Himmler's senior officers ‚Äì Eichmann, Becher and Clages ‚Äì had involved themselves with the Brand proposal.. Clages handed Brand $50,000 and 270,000 Swiss francs that the Germans had intercepted, sent to the Aid and Rescue Committee by rescue workers in Switzerland via the Swedish Embassy in Budapest.. Eichmann told Brand that he wanted 10,000 new trucks for the Waffen-SS to use on the Eastern front or for civilian purposes, as well as 200 tons of tea, 800 tons of coffee, 2,000,000 cases of soap, and a quantity of tungsten and other materials. If Brand returned from Istanbul with confirmation that the Allies had accepted the proposal, Eichmann said he would release 10 percent of the one million. The deal would proceed with 100,000 Jews released for every 1,000 trucks.; also see ; ; . May ‚Äì October 1944 =Mass deportations begin= Jews arriving at Auschwitz II from Hungary, c. May 1944. Most were sent straight to the gas chamber. It remains unclear whether Eichmann told Brand to return to Budapest by a particular date. According to Bauer, Brand said at various points that he was given one, two or three weeks or was advised that he could \\"take [his] time\\". Hansi Brand testified during Eichmann's trial in 1961 that she and her children had to remain in Budapest, effectively as hostages.. Brand and Eichmann met again, for the last time on 15 May, the day the mass deportations to Auschwitz began.. Between then and 9 July 1944, around 437,000 Jews, almost the entire Jewish population of the Hungarian countryside, were deported to Auschwitz on 147 trains. Most were gassed on arrival.; . =Brand leaves for Istanbul= Brand secured a letter of recommendation for the Jewish Agency from the Hungarian Jewish Council. He was told he would be travelling with Bandi Grosz (real name, Andor Gross), a Hungarian who had worked for Hungarian and German military intelligence; Grosz would travel to Istanbul as the director of a Hungarian transport company..Breitman and Aronson 1992, p. 177. The SS drove the men from Budapest to Vienna on 17 May, where they stayed the night in a hotel reserved for the SS. Grosz later testified that Brand's mission had been a cover for his own. He said he had been told by Clages to arrange a meeting in a neutral country between senior German and American officers, or British if necessary, to broker peace between the German Sicherheitsdienst and the Western Allies.; . =Meeting with Jewish Agency= In Vienna, Brand was given a German passport in the name of Eugen Band. He cabled the Jewish Agency in Istanbul to say he was on his way, and arrived by German diplomatic plane on 19 May.. Paul Rose writes that Brand had no idea at this point that the deportations to Auschwitz had already begun. Brand had been told by the Jewish Agency by return cable that \\"Chaim\\" would meet him in Istanbul. Convinced of the importance of his mission, he believed this was Chaim Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization, later the first president of Israel. In fact the man who had arranged to meet him was Chaim Barlas, head of the Istanbul group of Zionist emissaries. Furthermore, not only was Barlas not there, but there was no entry visa waiting for Brand, and he was threatened with arrest and deportation. Brand saw this as the first betrayal by the Jewish Agency.. Bauer argues that Brand, then and later, failed to grasp that the Jewish Agency was powerless. That his passport was in the name of Eugen Band would have been enough to cause the confusion. The visa situation was sorted out by Bandi Grosz and the men were taken to a hotel, where they met the Jewish Agency delegates.. Brand was furious that no one sufficiently senior was available to negotiate a deal.. The Jewish Agency agreed to arrange for Moshe Sharett, head of its political department and later second prime minister of Israel, to travel to Istanbul to meet him. Brand passed them a plan of Auschwitz (probably from the Vrba-Wetzler report) and demanded that the gas chambers, crematoria and railway lines be bombed. The discussions left him discouraged and depressed. He wrote that the delegates lacked any sense of urgency and were focused more on internal politics and Jewish emigration to Palestine, rather than the slaughter in Europe: \\"[They] were undoubtedly worthy men ... But they lacked any awareness of how critical was the period of history in which they were living. They had not looked death in the face day after day, as we had in Budapest ...\\"; . =Interim agreement= Ladislaus L√∂b writes that proposals and counter-proposals flew between Istanbul, London and Washington. The Jewish Agency and Brand wanted the Allies to string the Germans along in the hope of slowing the deportations.. The Agency gave Brand a document, dated 29 May 1944, that offered $400,000 for every 1,000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine, one million Swiss francs per 10,000 Jewish emigrants to neutral countries such as Spain, and 10,000 Swiss francs a month if the deportations were to stop. If the SS would allow the Allies to supply food, clothes and medicine to the Jews in concentration camps, the Nazis would be supplied with the same. Rose writes that the agreement was intended only to give Brand something to take back to Budapest. Brand cabled his wife on 29 and 31 May to tell her (and thereby Eichmann) about the agreement, but there was no response. Rezs≈ë Kasztner and Hansi Brand had been held in Budapest between 27 May and 1 June by the Hungarian Arrow Cross. They received the telegrams when they were released, but Eichmann refused to halt the deportations. =Arrested by British= Moshe Sharett, head of the Jewish Agency's political department; second prime minister of Israel 1954‚Äì1955 In Istanbul Brand was told that Moshe Sharett was unable to obtain a visa for Turkey.. The Jewish Agency asked Brand to meet Sharett instead in Aleppo on the Syrian-Turkish border. He was reluctant; the area was under British control and he was afraid they would want to question him, but the Agency told him it would be safe and he left by train with two of its delegates.. While on the train, Brand was approached by two representatives of Zeev Jabotinsky's Hatzohar (Revisionist Zionist) party and the World Agudath Israel Orthodox religious party. They told him the British were going to arrest him in Aleppo: \\"Die Engl√§nder sind in dieser Frage nicht unsere Verb√ºndeten\\"(\\"the British are not our allies in this matter\\").; for the German, . As soon as he arrived at the Aleppo train station on 7 June, he was stopped by a British man in plain clothes and pushed into a Jeep that was waiting with its engine running.. The British drove him to a villa, where for four days they tried to stop Moshe Sharett from meeting him. Sharett \\"fought a battle of telephones and cables,\\" Bauer writes, and on 11 June he and the Jewish Agency intelligence group were finally introduced to Brand. The discussion lasted several hours.; . Sharett wrote in a report of 27 June: \\"I must have looked a little incredulous, for he said: 'Please believe me: they have killed six million Jews; there are only two million left alive.'\\". At the end of the meeting, Sharett broke the news that the British were insisting Brand not return to Budapest. Brand became hysterical.. =Proposal rejected= Brand was taken to Cairo, where he was questioned by the British for weeks. On 22 June 1944 he was interviewed by Ira Hirschmann of the American War Refugee Board; Hirschmann wrote a positive report about Brand, but his influence was limited.; . Brand went on hunger strike for 17 days in protest at his detention. The British, Americans and Soviets discussed the proposal. British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden wrote a memo on 26 June outlining the options.. The British were convinced they were dealing with a Himmler trick, that Grosz was a double agent, and that Brand's mission was a \\"smokescreen\\" for the Germans to broker a peace deal without the Soviet Union.; . If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of Jews had been released in central Europe, Allied airborne and possibly land-based military operations might have had to stop. Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler's motive‚Äîto turn the Jews into human shields‚Äîbecause it would have allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army.. The Americans were more open to negotiating. A rift developed between them and the British who, Bauer writes, were worried about large-scale Jewish immigration to Palestine, then under British control.. Eden did suggest a counter-proposal on 1 July, but it was reduced, Bauer writes, to a ridiculous minimum. He told the American government that the British would allow Brand to return to Budapest with a message for Eichmann suggesting that 1,500 Jewish children be given safe passage to Switzerland; 5,000 from Bulgaria and Romania be allowed to leave for Palestine; and that Germany guarantee safe conduct for ships carrying Jewish refugees. He did not say what he would offer in return.. On 11 July Prime Minister Winston Churchill put an end to the idea when he told Eden that the murder of the Jews was \\"probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed\\", and that there should be \\"no negotiations of any kind on this subject\\". Of Brand's mission he wrote: \\"The project which has been put forward through a very doubtful channel seems itself also to be of the most nondescript character. I would not take it seriously.\\"Churchill, minute to Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, 11 July 1944, in FO 371/42809/115, and in Prem 4/51/10, National Archives, London, cited in ; also cited, in part, in and . The Cabinet Committee on Refugees decided on 13 July to \\"totally ignore the combined Brandt‚ÄìGestapo approach\\". =Leak to media= The British leaked details of Eichmann's proposal to the media. According to Michael Fleming, the BBC was the first to report it, which means, he writes, \\"it seems that the PWE [Political Warfare Executive] (and hence the Foreign Office) released the information\\". On 19 July 1944‚Äîthe day before the 20 July plot, the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler‚Äîthe New York Herald Tribune (dateline London, 18 July) reported that two Hungarian government emissaries in Turkey had proposed that Hungarian Jews be given safe passage in exchange for British and American pharmaceuticals and transport for the Germans. On 20 July The Times called it \\"one of the most loathsome\\" stories of the war, an attempt to \\"blackmail, deceive and split\\" the Allies, and a \\"new level of fantasy and self-deception\\". The mass deportation of Hungarian Jews had already stopped by the time of the leak. Following publication in mid-June of parts of the Vrba-Wetzler report, which described in detail the use of gas chambers inside Auschwitz, the Jewish Agency in Geneva had cabled London asking that Hungarian ministers be held personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted and passed to Hungarian regent Mikl√≥s Horthy, who on 7 July 1944 ordered an end to the deportations. The British released Brand on 5 October 1944. Brand said they would not allow him to return to Hungary and forced him to travel to Palestine. Bauer disputes this; in his view, Brand was simply afraid of returning to Budapest, convinced the Germans would murder him.; . =Himmler's involvement= Heinrich Himmler Germany's Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, had apparently known nothing about the proposal. He cabled Brigadef√ºhrer Edmund Veesenmayer of the SS on 20 July 1944 to ask about it, and was told on 22 July that Brand and Grosz had been sent to Turkey on the orders of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS. Eichmann himself said during interrogation after the war that the order had come from Himmler, as did SS officer Kurt Becher: \\"Himmler said to me: 'Take whatever you can from the Jews. Promise them whatever you want. What we will keep is another matter.'\\". According to Bauer, the \\"clumsiness of the approach has been a wonderment to all observers\\". Bauer argues that Eichmann wanted to murder Jews, not sell them, but was forced instead to act as Himmler's reluctant messenger. On the day Brand left Germany for Istanbul in May 1944, Eichmann was in Auschwitz checking that it was ready for the trainloads of Jews about to arrive from Hungary. The camp's commander, Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Rudolf H√∂ss, said it would be difficult to process such large numbers, whereupon Eichmann ordered that new arrivals be gassed immediately rather than going through \\"selection\\". This does not suggest that he was going to halt the killing until Brand returned from Istanbul.. In Bauer's view, the presence at one of the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was interested in secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, although not where and when. He may have wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability; in the event that Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler would be able to offer him a peace deal with the West that excluded the Soviet Union.. Brand himself came to believe that the proposal had been designed to drive a wedge between the Allies. Two months before his death in 1964, at the trial in Germany of Eichmann's deputies and , he said he had \\"made a terrible mistake in passing this on to the British. It is now clear to me that Himmler sought to sow suspicion among the Allies as a preparation for his much desired Nazi-Western coalition against Moscow.\\"\\"Allied Rift Called Aim of '44 Nazi Ransom Plan\\". The New York Times, 21 May 1964. =Kasztner train= Brand's failure to return to Budapest was a disaster for the Aid and Rescue Committee. On 27 May Hansi Brand, who at some point during this period had become Kasztner's lover, was arrested and beaten by the Hungarian Arrow Cross.; . Kasztner wrote that on 9 June Eichmann told him: \\"If I do not receive a positive reply within three days, I shall operate the mill at Auschwitz\\"State Attorney Bach, Trial of Adolf Eichmann, session 59, part 6/6, 31 May 1961. (\\"die Muehle laufen lasse\\"). During his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, Eichmann denied having said this to Kastner. He told the court that he did not have the authority to stop or start what was happening in Auschwitz, or to change the deal. The order from Berlin had said: \\"Deportations will continue in the meanwhile and will not be stopped until Joel Brand returns with a statement to the effect that these matters have been accepted by the Jewish organizations abroad.\\"Testimony of Adolf Eichmann, Trial of Adolf Eichmann, session 86, part 3/5, 5 July 1961. Hansi Brand told Claude Lanzman in 1979: Kasztner train passengers on their way to Switzerland from the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, August or December 1944 > We ... [lived] between fear and despair and hope. And that formed itself > into such a heap of stuff, that I can't really describe it ‚Äì how it was and > what it was. Every evening, we went to pieces and during the night, we tried > to build ourselves up again, so we could go into the street ... and look > like human beings again ... And [it] was like being in a windmill; it turned > and moved.; Transcript, Shoah interview with Hansi Brand, Steven Spielberg > Film and Video Archive, p. 22. Bauer argues that the Aid and Rescue committee made the mistake of almost adopting the antisemitic belief in unlimited Jewish power, that Jewish leaders could move around freely and persuade the Allies to act, and that American Jews had easy access to money and goods. The committee had similar trust in the Allies, but the latter were preparing for the invasion of Normandy, which began on 6 June 1944. \\"At that crucial moment,\\" writes Bauer, \\"to antagonize the Soviets because of some hare-brained Gestapo plan to ransom Jews was totally out of the question.\\". Despite the setbacks, Kasztner, Hansi Brand and the rest of the committee secured the release of around 1,684 Jews, including 273 children, who were allowed to leave Budapest for Switzerland by train on 30 June 1944. The committee paid SS officer Kurt Becher $1000 per person in foreign currency, shares, jewellery and gold, raised from the wealthier passengers to cover the cost of the rest. After an unexplained detour to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, the passengers arrived in Switzerland in two batches in August and December that year.; . Joel Brand's mother, sister and niece were on the train, as were 10 members of Kasztner's family and 388 people from the Kolozsv√°r ghetto in his home town. Kastner's relationship with these passengers led to the criticism that his negotiations with Becher had focused on saving people he knew, an allegation that led to his assassination in 1957.Porter 2007, p. 233ff. Later life =Move to Israel= Bauer concludes that Brand was a courageous man who had passionately wanted to help the Jewish people, but his life was plagued after the mission by suspicion, including from other members of the Aid and Rescue Committee, because of his failure to return to Budapest. After the British released him, he joined the Stern Gang, who were fighting to remove the British from Palestine.. He and Hansi Brand lived for the rest of their lives in Israel, at first moving to the Givat Brenner kibbutz, then to Tel Aviv, with their two sons.Wilkinson, Tracy (19 April 2000). \\"Hansi Brand; Worked to Help Jews Escape From the Holocaust\\", Los Angeles Times. =Testimony= Brand offered testimony about the blood-for-goods proposal during several trials. In 1954 he testified at the controversial libel trial in Jerusalem of Malchiel Gruenwald, who was sued by the Israeli government on behalf of Rezs≈ë Kasztner.For the testimony, see . Gruenwald was a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who had moved to Israel after the war. In a self-published pamphlet in 1952 he accused Kasztner, by then an Israeli civil servant, of having collaborated with the Nazis by dealing with Eichmann.. Brand testified for Kasztner, but instead of defending him took the opportunity to accuse the Jewish Agency, whose officials became the first Israeli government, of having helped the British scupper the blood-for-goods proposal.. After a trial that lasted 18 months, the judge concluded that, by negotiating with Eichmann, failing to warn the many to save the few on the Kasztner train, and writing an affidavit after the war for Kurt Becher, Kasztner had \\"sold his soul to the devil\\".. It was because of Kasztner's support for Becher that the Americans decided not to prosecute Becher at Nuremberg. Kasztner also wrote affidavits for SS officers Hans J√ºttner, Dieter Wisliceny and Hermann Krumey.. Eichmann in his prison yard in Israel. He was hanged on 31 May 1962. The judge said that Kasztner's failure to do more to warn the community that they were being sent to the gas chambers, not resettled, had helped Eichmann maintain order, and that the Kasztner train had been a payoff. Tom Segev called the ruling \\"one of the most heartless in the history of Israel, perhaps the most heartless ever\\".. The Supreme Court of Israel overturned most of the verdict in January 1958, ruling that the lower court had \\"erred seriously\\", but Kasztner was assassinated in 1957 as a result of the earlier judgment.. =Eichmann and Frankfurt trials= Brand's book was published in Israel in 1956 as Bi-sheli·∏•ut nidonim la mavet and in German in 1956 as Die Geschichte von Joel Brand. It appeared in English in 1958 as Advocate for the Dead: The Story of Joel Brand by Alex Weissberg, and was serialized in March and April that year by The Observer, which called it \\"the strangest story to come out of the war\\". Joel and Hansi Brand both testified in 1961 during the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem.; for Eichmann's arrest, see \\"Mass Murderer of Jews Found\\". The Guardian, 24 May 1960. Eichmann said he had chosen Brand because he had seemed like an \\"honest, idealistic man\\". That year Life magazine called Brand \\"a man who lives in the shadows with a broken heart\\".Golden, Harry (21 April 1961). \\"A Stranger to the Human Race\\". Life magazine, p. 46. In May 1964 he testified in Frankfurt against two of Eichmann's assistants, SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Hermann Krumey and SS- Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Otto Hunsche. Death Brand died of a heart attack, aged 58, during a visit to Germany in July 1964. He told an interviewer shortly before his death: \\"An accident of life placed the fate of one million human beings on my shoulders. I eat and sleep and think only of them.\\" Over 800 mourners attended his funeral in Tel Aviv, including Colonel Arieh Baz on behalf of Israel's President Zalman Shazar, and Teddy Kollek, director-general of the prime minister's office, on behalf of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol. The eulogy was delivered by Gideon Hausner, the attorney general who prosecuted Adolf Eichmann.\\"Joel Brand Buried in Israel; Shazar and Eshkol Represented at Ceremony\\", Jewish Telegraphic Agency, 23 July 1964.

Future The street is a featured street in Hong Kong and a venue for several films. Hopewell long planned a hotel project, Mega Tower Hotel at the east of the street but received opposition from the surrounding residents and environmental groups. It is because the project would also involve demolition of the historical building of the famous haunted house, Nam Koo Terrace () and felling of various climbing fig trees.

Television In the early days of television, most output was live. The hours of broadcast were limited and so a test card was commonly broadcast at other times. When a breakdown happened during a live broadcast, a standard recording filled in. On the BBC, a film of a potter's wheel was often used for this purpose, filmed at the Compton Potters' Arts Guild. Similar short films, such as a kitten playing, were also used as interludes or interstitial programs to fill gaps in TV schedules. In the United States, these have their roots in the old Saturday afternoon horror movies hosted on independent stations. Music albums Albums of music were typically of a set size determined by the physical medium such as the vinyl record (typically 22 minutes per side) or CD (maximum 80 minutes). It was normal, especially in the 1960s, for artists to attempt to \\"pad out\\" their material to the standard length by including filler tracks of lesser quality. Often songs written by the artists or the producer of an album were included as filler and/or released on the b-side of singles to generate more royalties for the songwriter or artist. Cover versions are often considered to be fillers, though this judgement varies with the amount of creative interpretation and adaption of the original. Similarly, live recordings, demo versions or remixes follow the same argument. On the subject of music downloads, Courtney Love told the Digital Hollywood conference \\"If you're afraid of your own filler then I bet you're afraid of Napster\\", meaning that other artists may be afraid of listeners being able to listen to a full album before buying it.

The Rotters' Club was inspired by Bohumil Hrabal's Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age: a Czech language novel that consisted of one great sentence.http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/archive/arts/sentence.shtml  Plot summary  Three teenage friends grow up in 1970s Britain watching their lives change as their world gets involved with IRA bombs, progressive and punk rock, girls and political strikes.

Fillers fall into the category of formulaic language, and different languages have different characteristic filler sounds. The term filler also has a separate use in the syntactic description of wh-movement constructions.  Usage  Every conversation involves turn-taking, which means that whenever someone wants to speak and hear a pause, they do so. Pauses are commonly used to indicate that someone‚Äôs turn has ended, which can create confusion when someone hasn‚Äôt finished a thought but has paused to form a thought; in order to prevent this confusion, they will use a filler word such as um, er, or uh. The use of a filler word indicates that the other person should continue listening instead of speaking. Filler words generally contain little to no lexical content, but instead provide clues to the listener about how they should interpret what the speaker has said. While there are many different reasons for using filler words, sociolinguists have identified six main reasons for doing so: pausing to give time for the speaker to gather their thoughts, speaking more indirectly in order to encourage politeness, approaching delicate topics gently, emphasizing ideas, providing clues to emotions or behaviors, and communicating uncertainty. The actual words that people use may change (such as the increasing use of like), but the meaning and reason why people use them doesn‚Äôt change. In English In American English, the most common filler sounds are ah or uh and um (er and erm in British English). Among younger speakers, the fillers \\"like\\", \\"you know\\", \\"I mean\\", \\"okay\\", \\"so\\", \\"actually\\", \\"basically\\", and \\"right\\" are among the more prevalent. Christopher Hitchens described the use of the word \\"like\\" as a discourse marker or vocalized pause as a particularly prominent example of the \\"Californianization of American youth-speak,\\" and its further recent spread throughout other English dialects via the mass-media.  Filler words in different languages  * In Afrikaans, , , and are common fillers (um, and uh being in common with English). * In American Sign Language, UM can be signed with open-8 held at chin, palm in, eyebrows down (similar to FAVORITE); or bilateral symmetric bent-V, palm out, repeated axial rotation of wrist (similar to QUOTE). * In Arabic, (\\"means\\") and (\\"by God\\") are common fillers.

Wh-movement is said to create a long-distance or unbounded \\"filler-gap dependency\\".

However, it performed a useful ground-attack role in the China-Burma-India theater, notably from airfields too rough for many other aircraft. As the war drew to a close, the Japanese began using them in kamikaze attacks. Total production was around 2,385 units.

Just as in English, points are scored by playing valid words from the lettered tiles. In French there are 102 tiles - 100 lettered tiles and two blanks known as jokers. The official word list for Francophone Scrabble is L'Officiel du jeu Scrabble. Forms of play A completed game in French There are two forms of competition Scrabble in French. Scrabble classique, also known as partie libre, is match play, as in the English-language game. Duplicate Scrabble is an alternative form of the game where all players have the same letters and board in front of them, and play against the theoretical top score. =Duplicate= An arbiter is used to choose the letters for the game. He draws seven tiles at random to start the game and announces them; the players draw the same seven tiles and the arbiter starts the clock. After the allotted time period, the arbiter stops the clock and the players must submit their solutions to the nearest official. The highest scoring word (known as the top) is announced and placed on the display board by the arbiter, and the players do the same. At the end of the game, the arbiter announces the top - the total score of all the moves, which is the theoretical high score which cannot be beaten. The winner of the game can be expressed in three different ways. Points scored, points dropped compared to the top, or percentage. Rules of duplicate: * The highest scoring word must be placed on the board after each move. However if there is more than one word which have the same score, the arbiter chooses the word which is most apt for opening the board up. * It is possible to score more than 100% by benefitting from a solo top. A solo top is when only one player finds the top play, and is awarded a bonus of 10 points which is added to his total score at the end of the game. * Any invalid word is known as a z√©ro and means what it implies - the player gets zero points for that move * There must be at least one vowel and one consonant in each rack, or else the letters are put back in the bag and redrawn until the rack meets these criteria. If no more vowels or no more consonants remain, the game ends with the final score as it stands at that moment. Both the letter Y and the blank are counted as both a vowel and a consonant. The World Championship The French Language World Championship or le championnat du monde de Scrabble francophone uses the duplicate format and has been held every year since 1972. Two players have won the World Championship five times; Michel Duguet and Christian Pierre. The current World Champion (2007) is Antonin Michel of France. The elite competition is limited to qualifiers who compete in their national championships. Although around 270 take place every year, this is a relatively small field compared to tournaments where more than 1000 people compete. Most other tournaments are open to all members of the international federation. At The French World Championships, more than one title is distributed. There are 5 age categories; cadet (younger than 16) junior (16-18), senior (all players) vermeil (60-69) and diamant (70+). There is an official winner of each age category with the winner of the senior category being the overall world champion. There are also multiple tournaments; duplicate, duplicate pairs, duplicate blitz (60 seconds per move) and a matchplay Scrabble world cup. The match play Scrabble world cup event was introduced in 2006, won by Parfait Mouanda of the Republic of the Congo. The competition was played over 3 days and 12 games, with the two finalists playing a best of three series to decide a winner.

Sweyn Haakonsson (Old Norse: Sveinn H√°konarson, )Anglicized and modern Scandinavian forms include Svein, Sweyn, Svend and Sven. (died c. 1016) was an earl of the house of Hla√∞ir and co-ruler of Norway from 1000 to c. 1015. He was the son of earl H√°kon Sigur√∞arson. He is first mentioned in connection with the battle of Hj√∂rungav√°gr, where the Heimskringla says he commanded 60 ships. After the battle of Svolder in the year 1000, Sveinn became co-ruler of Norway with his half-brother, Eir√≠kr H√°konarson. After Eir√≠kr went to England in 1014, Sveinn was co-ruler with H√°kon Eir√≠ksson. In 1015,Or 1014 or 1016, the sources are hard to reconcile. √ìl√°fr Haraldsson arrived in Norway and claimed the throne. He defeated Sveinn and his allies in the battle of Nesjar. Sveinn retreated to Sweden, intending to muster a force to retake Norway but he died of an illness before he could return. Sveinn married H√≥lmfr√≠√∞r, who was either the daughter or sister of king √ìl√°fr of Sweden. They had the daughter Sigr√≠√∞r, who was married to √Åsl√°kr, son of Erlingr Skj√°lgsson. Another daughter, Gunnhildr, was married to Sveinn √ölfsson. Only one court-poet, Bersi Sk√°ldtorfuson, is recorded as being in Sveinn's service and very little of his poetry has come down to us. The written sources mentioning Sveinn were all written over 150 years after his death. The Swedish historian Staffan Hellberg in 1972 claimed to be able to show that Sveinn was a fictitious person, and that he had never lived.Hellberg, Staffan (1972). Slaget vid Nesjar och \\"Sven jarl H√•konsson\\". Scripta Islandica, Uppsala 1972, pp. 21‚Äì30 (in Swedish). The debate about this formed part of the wider debate about the value of the 12th and 13th century sagas for 11th century history and earlier, and is an example of the saga skepticism, particularly widespread in Swedish academia. Hellberg's conclusions remain speculative. Notes References *Finlay, Alison (editor and translator) (2004). Fagrskinna, a Catalogue of the Kings of Norway.

Larvae and adults are common predators of bark beetles in Europe.  Life cycle  The adults overwinter at the base of conifers, rarely of deciduous trees. They emerge in the spring and fly to lower parts of trees to hunt bark beetles. Their common prey are pine bark beetles Tomicus piniperda and T. minor, and the European spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus. Often they are seen waiting their prey on the bark of fallen pine or spruce trees. Both ant beetles and bark beetles are attracted to monoterpenes from the damaged areas of the fallen trees. Stacked wood is especially attractive due to the monoterpene volatiles. The ant beetles are also attracted to specific pheromone components of bark beetles therefore they often fall into bark beetle pheromone traps.N.J. Mills, \\"The natural enemies of scolytids infesting conifer bark in Europe in relation to the biological control of Dendroctonus spp. in Canada\\", Biocontrol News and Information, Vol. 4, Issue 4, pp. 305-328, 1983. The larvae enter the scolytid galleries and feed on the immature stages of the bark beetles. The larvae grow very slowly, spending two years in the larval stage, and pupate in the fall in niches in the outer bark. Adults of T. formicarius live 4 to 10 months.R. Gauss, ‚ÄúDer Ameisenbuntk√§fer Thanasimus formicarius Latr.als Borkenk√§ferfeind,‚Äù pp. 417-429 in G. Wellenstein (ed.), Die grosse Borkenk√§ferkalamit√§t in S√ºdwest-Deutschland 1944-1951,1954. Males and females mate repeatedly, with many different partners throughout the season. Mating is short, and the copulation precedes a chase and a firm grasp of the female with the male mandibles on her pronotum. The females lay eggs from April to June. Usually they produce 20 to 30 eggs that they lay in bark crevices and in the vicinity of the bark of pine trees running tunnel of the bark beetle. The pink-colored larvae hatch after about a week and live under the bark, where they are predators of bark beetle larvae, eggs and pupae, but also feed on other insects living under the bark. In pursuit of their prey, they are also very quick and very skilled at moving the bark beetle corridors, where they can run backwards. Before pupation, the larvae form an oval chamber which they line with mucus under the bark. The following spring the beetles emerge.Bohumil Star√Ω, Pavel Bezdecka, Miroslav Capek, Petr Star√Ω, Georg Benz, et al.: Atlas der n√ºtzlichen Forstinsekten. Ferdinand Enke, Stuttgart 1990, , S. 37 u. 76  Prey range  T. formicarius feeds on 27 bark-beetle species belonging to 15 genera (Dendroctonus, Dryocoetes, Hylastes, Hylesinus, Hylurgops, Hylurgus, Ips, Leperesinus, Orthotomicus, Pityogenes, Pityokteines, Polygraphus, Scolytus, Tomicus and Trypodendron) which infest coniferous (pine, spruce, larch, Douglas fir,and others), and broad-leaved trees (oak, ash, poplar, and others).B.A. Tommeras, ‚ÄúThe clerid beetle Thanasimus formicarius is attracted to the pheromone of the ambrosia beetle Trypodendron lineatum,‚Äù Experientia, Vol. 44, pp. 536-537, 1988.  Behaviour  The adults grab their prey with all their legs quickly so the prey can't run away. Then the beetle bites between the thorax and abdomen, or head and thorax to leverage out the soft succulent parts of a bark beetle. The whole feeding process takes only about 10 minutes. The clerids can feed on about 3 bark beetles per day for several days. It is interesting that once a clerid begins to feed it almost always finishes the process so it never wastes prey. Different experiments suggest that ant beetles prefer Pinus trees over Abies or Picea for oviposition. Some experiments suggested that bark thickness could be a critical factor limiting pupation of T. formicarius on spruce.Why a Large Range of Prey for a Specialized Predator?

It is primarily associated with Hispania under Visigothic rule (mainly in what was to become modern Spain) and with the Catholic Visigoths/Mozarabs living under Islamic rule, and was soon replaced by the chant of the Roman rite following the Christian Reconquest. Although its original medieval form is largely lost, a few chants have survived with readable musical notation, and the chanted rite was later revived in altered form and continues to be used in a few isolated locations in Spain, primarily in Toledo. Terminology Dissatisfaction with the Islamic term \\"Mozarabic chant\\" has led to the use of several competing names for the music to which it refers. The Islamic term Mozarabic was used by the Islamic rulers of Hispania (Al Andalus) to refer to the Mozarabs, that is, the Visigothic Christians of Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal) living under Muslim rule. However, the chant existed before the Muslim occupation began in 711. Visigothic refers to the Visigoths who dominated the Iberian peninsula in the centuries prior to the Muslim invasion and converted from Arian Christianity to Roman Catholic Christianity in 587. However, this Catholic rite existed in Hispania prior to their conversion, and the chant was not limited to the Visigoths, so \\"Old Spanish\\" can also be seen as an inaccurate alternative. Because the chant was found in Portugal as well as Spain, the term \\"Hispanic\\" has also been used by scholars. Because of the ambiguity and vagueness of the terms \\"Visigothic\\", \\"Hispanic\\", and \\"Mozarabic\\", \\"scholars have come to favour the term 'Old Hispanic' for this repertory\\" . History The basic structure of the rite that came to be known as the Visigothic rite (later Mozarabic) was documented by St. Isidore of Seville in the 7th century. The Credo had already been introduced into the Visigothic rite (later Mozarabic rite) in the Third Council of Toledo of 589, in which the Visigoths officially converted to Catholicism. (The Credo would not be used in the Roman rite in Rome itself until after 1014, at the request of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry II.) The city of Toledo The Visigothic rite (later Mozarabic rite) shares similarities with the Ambrosian rite and Gallican rite, and differs from the Roman rite. As the Christian reconquest of Hispania went on, the Roman rite supplanted the Mozarabic. With the papal appointment of a French abbot as the new archbishop of Toledo, which had been recaptured in 1085, Roman influence could be enforced throughout the Hispanic Church. Following its official suppression by Pope Gregory VII, the Mozarabic rite and its chant disappeared in all but six parishes in Toledo. The Visigothic/Mozarabic rite was revived by Cardinal Jim√©nez de Cisneros, who published in 1500 and 1502 a Mozarabic Missal and Breviary, incorporating elements of the Roman rite, and dedicated a chapel to preserving the Visigothic/Mozarabic rite. However, the chant used for this restored Visigothic/Mozarabic rite shows significant influence from Gregorian chant, and does not appear to resemble the Visigothic/Mozarabic chant sung prior to the reconquest. General characteristics The Visigothic chant (later Mozarabic chant) is largely defined by its role in the liturgy of the Visigothic rite (later Mozarabic rite), which is more closely related to the northern \\"Gallic\\" liturgies such as the Gallican rite and the Ambrosian rite than the Roman rite. Musically, little is known about the chant. Most of the surviving music is written in neumes that show the contour of the chant, but no pitches or intervals. Only twenty or so sources contain music that can be transcribed. However, some things are known about the Visigothic/ Mozarabic repertory. Like all plainchant, Visigothic/ Mozarabic chant was monophonic and a cappella. In accordance with Roman Catholic tradition, it is primarily intended to be sung by males. As in Gregorian chant, Visigothic/Mozarabic chant melodies can be broadly grouped into four categories: recitation, syllabic, neumatic, and melismatic. Recitations are the simplest, consisting primarily of a simple reciting tone. Syllabic chants have mostly one note per syllable. Neumatic chants have a small number of notes, often just two or three, notes per syllable. Melismatic chants feature long, florid runs of notes, called melismas, on individual syllables. In both Visigothic/Mozarabic and Gregorian chant, there is a distinction between antiphonal and responsorial chants. Originally, responsorial chant alternated between a soloist singing a verse and a chorus singing a refrain called the respond, while antiphonal chant alternated between two semi-choruses singing a verse and an interpolated text called an antiphon. In the developed chant traditions, they took on more functional characteristics. In an antiphonal chant, the antiphon is generally longer and more melodic than the verse, which is usually sung to a simpler formula called a psalm tone. In a responsorial chant, the verse and refrain are often comparable in style and melodic content. Visigothic/Mozarabic chants used a different system of psalm tones for psalm antiphons than Gregorian chant. Unlike the standardized Gregorian classification of chants into eight modes, Visigothic/Mozarabic chant used between four and seven, depending on the local tradition. Many Visigothic/Mozarabic chants are recorded with no musical notation at all, or just the incipit, suggesting that the psalm tones followed simple and frequently used formulas. Repertoire =Chants of the Office= Location of Toledo in modern Spain The musical forms encountered in Visigothic/Mozarabic chant present a number of analogies with those of the Roman rite. For example, a comparable distinction exists between antiphonal and responsorial singing. And Visigothic/Mozarabic chant may be seen to make use of three styles: syllabic, neumatic and melismatic, much as in Gregorian chant. In the following descriptions of the principal musical items in both the Visigothic/ Mozarabic Office and Mass, some of these analogies will be discussed further. The items from the Mass are presented here in the appropriate liturgical order. The Antiphons are the largest category of Office chants. Most are moderately syllabic, with simple recitations used for the verses, sung in antiphony. The Alleluiatici are also antiphonal chants, whose text usually involves an alleluia, similar in style to regular antiphons. Unlike the Gregorian repertory, these are sung at Matins and Vespers even on penitential days, when \\"alleluia\\" is omitted from the liturgy. Matins features a musical form called the missa, which consists of an Alleluiaticus framed by two Antiphons and a Responsory. Later missae show common musical material thematically uniting the missa. The Responsories, which are primarily found at the end of a missa, are generally neumatic, consisting of melodic formulas that adjust to fit the lengths of different phrases, ending in a fixed cadence. Other Office chants include the morning-themed Matutinaria, the Benedictiones using texts from the Book of Daniel, the melismatic Soni, and the alleluiatic Laudes. The Psallendi, unrelated to the Psallendae of Ambrosian chant, end with the Doxology. The neumatic Vespertini, like the Lucernaria of Ambrosian chant, usually allude to the lighting of lamps or to nightfall. They show a high degree of centonization, construction from a vocabulary of stock musical phrases, and adaptation, application of a pre- existing melody to a new text. Preces are short, lightly neumatic musical prayers in rhyme with a refrain. They exist in both the Visigothic /Mozarabic rite and the Gallican rite, but the concordance between the two rites appears to be liturgical and not musical. Finally, the Office chants include a number of Hymns, many of which are found throughout Catholic Europe, although we do not know if the same melodies were used. =Chants of the Mass= The Mass is the Christian celebration of the Eucharist. Plainchant occurs prominently in the Mass for several reasons: to communally affirm the faith, to expand on the scriptural lessons, and to cover certain actions. Praelegenda are opening chants corresponding to the Gregorian Introit, which use the same antiphonal structure and psalm tones found in the Visigothic/ Mozarabic Office. Unlike the Gregorian Gloria, the Visigothic/ Mozarabic Gloria in excelsis Deo only occurs in some local traditions. The Trisagion, in which the Greek word \\"hagios\\" is sung three times, sometimes quite melismatically or translated into the Latin \\"sanctus,\\" corresponds to the simple threefold \\"Kyrie eleison\\" sung at the end of the Laus missa of the Ambrosian rite. This is not the liturgical counterpart of the Gregorian Sanctus. Following the Trisagion are the Benedictiones. Like the Benedictiones of the Office, these come from the Book of Daniel, but use more complex melodies, whose refrain structure derives directly from the biblical poetry. The Psalmi are neumatic and melismatic responsorial chants which function similarly to the Gregorian Gradual. On a few holidays, the Psalmo leads directly into a Clamor. Clamores conclude with the refrain of the preceding Psalmo. During Lent, Threni substitute for Psalmi. Each Threnus has a non-repeating refrain followed by several verses, which are sung to the same melody. This function of replacing another chant on certain penitential days is similar to the way the Gregorian Tract replaces the Alleluia. Just as the Gregorian Gradual is followed by the Alleluia, the Visigothic/ Mozarabic Psalmo is followed by the Laus. Like the Gregorian Alleluias, the Laudes include two melismas on the word \\"alleluia\\" surrounding a simpler verse. During Lent, the Laudes use different texts. The Sacrificium corresponds to the Gregorian Offertory. The Sacrificia appear to be closely related to the Soni chants of the Office. A few Visigothic/ Mozarabic Masses include the Ad pacem, a special Antiphon sung for the kiss of peace, or the Ad sanctus, similar to the Gregorian Sanctus. Corresponding to the Ambrosian Confractorium is the Ad confractionem panis, sung for the breaking of the bread. The chant Ad accedentes, corresponding to the Gregorian Communion, follows.

His reign broke from the early Ahom rule and established a multi-ethnic polity in his kingdom. Under him the Ahom Kingdom expanded greatly for the first time since Sukaphaa, at the cost of the Chutiya and the Dimasa kingdoms. He also successfully defended his kingdom against the first Muslim invasions under Turbak Khan. During his time, the Khen dynasty collapsed and the Koch dynasty ascended in the Kamata kingdom. His general, Tonkham, pursued the Muslims up to the Karatoya river, the western boundary of the erstwhile Kamarupa Kingdom, the farthest west an Ahom king had ventured in its entire six hundred years of rule. He was the first Ahom king to adopt a Hindu title, Swarganarayana, indicating a move towards an inclusive polity; and Ahom kings came to be known as the Swargadeo which is the Assamese translation of Ahom word Chao-Pha. He is also called the Dihingia Raja, because he made Bakata on the Dihing River his capital and also belonged to the Dihingia clan. Suhungmung was the last progenitor Ahom king (all subsequent kings were his descendants). Expansion Under Suhungmung the Ahom Kingdom acquired a vision of an extended polity and consolidated rule. He began by suppressing the revolt of the Aitonia Nagas in 1504 and making them accept Ahom overlordship. He surveyed the country and annexed the Habung region.(which was a part of Chutia kingdom).Guha, Amalendu, The Ahom Political System: An Enquiry into the State Formation Process in Medieval Assam (1228-1714),p. 19, He first annexed Habung in 1512 and later also the rest of the Hinduised Chutia kingdom But his biggest successes was against the rest of the Chutiya Kingdom. Ahom territories until 1522 AD before the expansion by Suhungmung. =Against Chutiya Kingdom= As Suhungmung had annexed Panbari of HabungGoswami,Hemchandra, Purani Asam Buranji, p.40.Bhuyan, Surjya Kumar, Deodhai Buranji, p.16.(previously a Chutiya principality)Guha, Amalendu,Pre- Ahom Roots and the Medieval State in Assam: A Reply,p. 73, Before its annexation by Ahoms, Habung was a Chutia dependencyA Chutia chief named Vrihat-patra referred to as Habung-adhipati is mentioned in the copper plate of Durlabhnarayan dated to 1428 A.D. Another plate of Dhirnarayan dated 1522 AD was found in the region which indicates that Habung was reclaimed by Chutias in 1520 A.D. during the war of Dihinhmukh in 1512, the Chutiya king Dhirnarayan attacked the Ahoms at Dikhoumukh the next year, but was unsuccessful. The Chutiyas again attacked the Ahoms in 1520 and occupied the areas up to Namdang and Mungkhrang. But, soon Dhirnarayan died and the reign of the kingdom was passed to the son-in-law named Nitipal who was weak and inefficient in ruling. Many other vassal chiefs of Lakhimpur‚Äå, Majuli, Biswanath became independent and were eventually annexed by the Ahoms. In 1522, the Ahoms fought back, re-occupied their lost territories and erected a fort at Dibrumukh (Dibrugarh). Although, Nitipal tried to attack the fort the following year, he was unsuccessful. Suhungmung then extended the Ahom Kingdom to the mouth of the Tiphao River, where a new fort was constructed. The Chutiyas fortified Sadia but they were soon defeated. The Chutiyas were pursued further and their king and prince were killed in battle. Sati Sadhani also sacrificed her life in this battle. Upon annexing the Chutia territories, the Ahoms came in contact with hill tribes like Miris, Abors, Mishmis and Daflas. Suhungmung established the office of the Sadiyakhowa Gohain and gave charge to Phrasengmung Borgohain to look after the newly acquired Sadiya region. The rest of the newly acquired territories were divided among the Buragohain and Borgohain, while new offices were created to administer the country more efficiently. These included Thao-mung Mung-teu(Bhatialia Gohain)Chao-Cheng-Kung-rin Klangseng was made the first Bhatialia Gohain with headquarters at Habung (Lakhimpur), Thao-mung Ban-lung(Banlungia Gohain) at Banlung (Dhemaji), Thao-mung Mung-klang(Dihingia gohain) at Dihing (Dibrugarh and northern Sibsagar) and Chaolung Shulung at Tiphao (northern Dibrugarh). In 1527, a new ministerial position named Borpatrogohain was created (borrowed from the Chutia Vrihat-patra), and Klangseng(previously posted as Bhatialia Gohain) was given charge.Thao-mung mungteu(Bhatialia Gohain) was made Chao- sheng-lung in Lakni Rungrao 1527.(p.61.)Klangseng is mentioned as Chao-sheng- lung in Lakni Dapplao 1531.(p.64) Though this was not the end of the conflict it brought to an end the first major expansion of the Ahom Kingdom. =Against Kachari Kingdom= In 1526, Suhungmung marched against the Kachari Kingdom. In 1531 Khunkhara, the Kachari king, sent forces under his brother Detcha to drive the Ahoms away from Marangi but the Kachari army was defeated and their commander killed. The Kacharis were pursued up to the capital Dimapur and Khunkhara had to flee. Suhungmung established a Kachari prince, Detsung, as the Kachari king. But Detsung rose in revolt in a few years, and the Ahoms pursued him till Jangmarang where he was killed. The Kachari Kingdom abandoned Dimapur permanently and established their new capital at Maibong. Unlike the Chutiya Kingdom, Suhungming did not take direct possession of the Kachari Kingdom. =Muslim invasions= The first Muslim invasion of the Ahom Kingdom occurred in 1527, but it was defeated and pushed back to the Burai River. A few years later, there was another attempt when a commander advanced up the Brahmaputra in fifty vessels. This too was defeated. In yet another expedition, the Barpatra Gohain slain the commander, Bit Malik, and captured cannons and guns. The most successful among these initial raids on the Ahom Kingdom was the one led by Turbak. Turbak, a Gaur commander, advanced against the Ahom Kingdom in April 1532 with a large force. He first faced Suklen, Suhungmung's son, at Singri. In this battle Suklen was defeated and wounded and the Ahoms retreated to Sala. The Ahoms again faced reverses at Sala and some other expeditions thereafter, but won the first significant victory in March 1533 when a naval force was defeated with heavy losses to Turbak's forces. This led to a period of stalemate with the two armies encamped on opposite banks of the Dikrai River. The Ahoms finally attacked the invaders and defeated them in a number of battles.Nang Mula was also martyred in this battle. In the final battle fought near the Bharali River, Turbak was killed and his army pursued till the Karatoya river in present-day North Bengal. The captured soldiers subsequently became the first significant Muslim population of the Ahom Kingdom. They were called Garia since they were from Gaur, and the appellation was later extended to all Muslims. This population finally became well known as expert brass craftsmen. The Buranjis mention the first use of firearms by the Ahoms in these battles. Death Suhungmung was assassinated by a servant, Ratiman, who stabbed him as he slept in his palace. It is suspected that Suhungmung's son Suklenmung along with Suhungmung's Kachari princess, who became the next king, was responsible for the death. Descendants Suhungmung had four sons. The eldest, Suklen, who succeeded him, was established as the Tipam Raja. His second son, Suleng (also spelled Sureng and sometimes called Deoraja), was established as the Charing Raja. Though Suleng himself did not become a king, some of his descendants enjoyed kingship for some time. The third son, Suteng, was established as the Namrupiya Raja, and his descendants established the Tungkhungia line. The fourth son, Sukhring, also called Dop Raja, remained without any estate. * Suhungmong  Suklenmung (Tipam Raja) * Sukhaamphaa (Khora Raja)  Susenghphaa (Pratap Singha) * Suramphaa (Bhoga Raja) * Sutingphaa (Noriya Raja)  Sutamla (Jayadhwaj Singha)  Suleng (Deoraja) (Charing) * ??

However, the height difference of about between the two rivers would require as many as 32 locks, which was not feasible. In 1879, the Ministry of Public Works adopted a proposal by Edwin Clark which used boat lifts instead of locks. The first lift () was built between 1885 and 1888. It was inaugurated on June 4, 1888 by King Leopold II. The three other boat lifts were finally finished in 1917 and put into service in 1919. There were several reasons for this delay. From 1894 to 1911, the economic need for the canal was repeatedly called into question. Then in 1914, when the three lifts were practically finished, World War I began. = New canal = The old canal could accommodate boats with a displacement of up to 350 tons. In 1957 the Belgian parliament passed a law providing for a major expansion of the canal, increasing the maximum displacement of a boat that could use the canal to . In the event, it was decided to alter the course of the canal rather than to enlarge it along the full extent of its existing length.

The film features Shaam, Arya, Laila, Asin and Pooja in the lead roles as five college students. The film's score and soundtrack are composed by Harris Jayaraj, while Vairamuthu penned the lyrics for the songs. The film tells the reunion of five friends who were together at college and exploring their relationships during the years. The film released after several delays in 2005 and went on to win critical and commercial success. The film marked the first successful film for Jeeva and Shaam while Arya and Asin received several film offers after the release of the film. Plot The movie is all about a group of five college friends ‚Äî Shaam (Shaam), Emaan (Arya), Pooja (Laila), Priya (Asin) and Irene (Pooja). The friends gather for Emaan's wedding, years after everyone has parted ways. The movie starts with Pooja leaving the USA to go to Indian cricketer and her friend Emaan's wedding. Meanwhile, back in India, everyone else is helping Emaan with the preparations for his wedding and catching up with their long- lost college friends. The movie goes through series of flashbacks of old memories during their college days. Emaan and Irene meet for the first time after years. It turns out that they were once in love during their college days but Irene, who is from an unstable family, decides to part ways with Emaan after he loses focus on his long time goal of becoming a successful cricketer. Another flashback occurs when Shaam gets reminded of Pooja. She is a fun-loving tomboyish and naive girl, who is best friends with Shaam. Shaam realizes that he is in love with Priya, but on the other hand, Pooja realizes that she is falling for Shaam. Shaam and Pooja had respectively decided to propose their love interests on the coming Valentine's Day. But on that day, Pooja learns beforehand that Shaam is in love with Priya instead. Heartbroken by what she has just learned, she decides to keep her love for him a secret. When Shaam proposes Priya, she rejects his love as she believes in a more traditional approach towards finding a life partner. She reveals to him that she will be getting married, right after their graduation, to the man of her parents' choice. Pooja eventually goes to the USA for her higher studies and settles down there. Shaam has also tried to move on since then and becomes a fashion designer. The film transitions back to the present on Emaan's wedding day. Everyone attends his wedding as Pooja finally arrives. She is no longer the same girl she was back then, as she is much more mature now and not as tomboyish as she was back then. Over sometime, Shaam has come to realize that he missed Pooja's presence and is much fond of her now. He realizes that he had failed to appreciate her all those times when she was there with him. The day after Emaan's wedding, Pooja leaves to catch her flight back to USA. Right before her departure, she decides to pass Shaam the Valentine's Day card that she had wanted to hand him during their college days and reveals her love for him. Shaam realizes that Pooja is the one that was meant to be for him and not Priya. The movie ends with Shaam accepting Pooja's love for him.

Susi Ganeshan had appealed for the title Pepsi for a film; however, since the title Pepsi was registered by Jeeva, Ganeshan ended up renaming his film Five Star (2002). The title Pepsi had stemmed from the first letter from the names of the five friends ‚Äî Priya, Emaan, Pooja, Shyam and Irene. The film was later renamed and the film took part of the brand Pepsi's tagline in Tamil Nadu - Ullam Ketkumae More - as the new title. Laila was also reported to be a part of the cast. Asin signed the film aged eighteen and the film was meant to mark her d√©but in Tamil films. This was the second film that Asin has worked on after the Malayalam film Narendran Makan Jayakanthan Vaka (2001). While working as a software engineer, Jamshad was approached by Jeeva to audition for the film in 2003 after Jeeva spotted Jamshad walking in his neigborhood. Jeeva gave Jamshad the stage name of Arya for this film. Pooja was also signed on to make her d√©but. Srinath, who worked as an assistant director under Jeeva in 12B (2001), was cast in this film as Shaam and Arya's friend. Model Hemanth Kumar was cast in a negative role. Art director Thotta Tharani created a college campus for the film to be shot in, with his work drawing appreciation. A scene featuring an inter college day cultural had 100 students from various states take part in the shooting while decorations and a podium were put up for a marriage scene in Taj Connemara hotel. Raju Sundaram choreographed five songs including a song shot at hot water springs in New Zealand. The film went through production hell, with three years being spent on the announcement till release. The film was supposed to be the debut film of Arya, Asin, and Pooja. Th delay of the film enabled the lead actors to gain popularity with other releases: Arinthum Ariyamalum (2005) for Arya, M. Kumaran Son of Mahalakshmi (2004) for Asin, and Jay Jay (2003) and Attahasam (2004) for Pooja. Despite giving indications that the film would release after delays on 14 April 2004 it was further pushed back due to financial issues. In May 2005, the Supreme Court finally cleared the decks for the release, as earlier the Madras High court by a 25 February order appointed \\"Joint Receivers\\" for the film, which was objected by Prasad Labs who had gone to Supreme Court. It was agreed that the collections from the film will be received by \\"joint receivers\\" who will pay Prasad Labs for 72 prints of the film. Release The film released on 3 June 2005 and became a commercial success at the box office with pundits describing the film as a \\"sleeper hit\\". A critic from Sify gave the film a verdict of above average and stated that \\"On the whole, Jeeva has been successful to make an entertainer with a wafer-thin story. Everything, from the choice of lead actors, their lines and gestures, interpersed with perfect song-n-dance is perfectly coordinated\\". The film took a 90 percent opening in four Chennai screens with large collections reported at the Devi theatre in Chennai in the opening weekend. The film opened at number two at the Chennai box office despite stiff competition, just below the Rajinikanth starrer Chandramukhi. The film was also dubbed in Telugu as Preminchi Choodu and released on 30 March 2006. Music The music and background score were composed by Harris Jayaraj and became popular upon release. The songs were released on YouTube by Think Music India in 2020.  Legacy  The film was notably one of the first Tamil films in the reunion genre. Several news websites including The Times of India and The New Indian Express listed this film as one to watch on Friendship Day along with several other films including Thalapathi (1991), Kadhal Desam (1996), Friends (2001), Chennai 60028 (2007), Naadodigal (2009), and Nanban (2012). The success of the film brought a series of offers for Shaam, whose career was struggling prior to release. The success of the film prompted ABCD, another film starring Shaam, to release two months later. Arya and Asin were able to consolidate their positions as rising actors. Srinath garnered acclaim for his role as a bespectacled college student in this film. Arya and Pooja, who played lovers in this film, went on to feature opposite each other in Oram Po (2007) and Naan Kadavul (2009). Manigandan, who worked as an assistant director in this film and taught Arya how to act, later worked with Arya in Chikku Bukku (2010). After this film, Shaam and Arya starred together in Purampokku Engira Podhuvudamai (2015). Arya went on to work on several multi-starrers post this film including Pattiyal (2006), Raja Rani (2013), Arrambam (2013), Yatchan (2015),} Bangalore Naatkal (2016), and Kaappaan (2019).

It is in height and became operational in October 1902. It was the last traditional-style 'rock tower' (i.e. offshore lighthouse) to be built by Trinity House.  Construction  In 1900 to 1902 under the direction of Sir Thomas Matthews, the Trinity House Engineer-in- Chief, the lighthouse was built, sited about 165 metres seawards from the base of the cliffs. For the construction, a temporary cable car from the cliff was installed for the transport of workers and stones to an iron ocean platform adjacent to the lighthouse. 3,660 tons of Cornish granite were used in the construction of the tower. The lighthouse was equipped with a first-order revolving catadioptric optic made up of three double panels, giving two white flashes every 20 seconds; The lightsource was a Matthews-designed paraffin vapour burner. The newly built lighthouse was also provided with an explosive fog signal, which was sounded every five minutes in foggy weather; it involved the keepers attaching a small explosive charge together with a detonator to each arm of a jib located on the gallery of the lighthouse; when winched into place, connection was made with a dynamo-electric firing machine inside the lantern, from where the charge was remotely fired.  Operation  For more than 80 years, the red-and-white striped tower was manned by three lighthouse keepers. Their primary job was to maintain the revolving light, which was then visible out to sea. For most of the 20th century cooking was done on a solid- fuel range and the accommodation was lit by paraffin lamps. Electricity first reached the lighthouse in 1975, whereupon an electric lamp was installed in the optic. The explosive fog signal remained in use until 1976 (when it was replaced by an 'ELG 500' electric emitter); at the time Beachy Head was one of the last lighthouses still using explosive signals. The lighthouse was fully automated in 1983 and the keepers withdrawn. A chalk fall on the cliff in 1999 severed the electric cable; during its repair the lamp and fog signal were replaced and upgraded. In June 2010, Trinity House announced in the five yearly \\"Aids To Navigation Review\\" that the light range would be reduced to and the fog signal discontinued. In February 2011, the work was undertaken and light range reduced by the installation of a new LED navigation light system. The old lens, though no longer in use, was left in situ. The fog signal was also discontinued at this time. Trinity House announced in 2011 that it could no longer afford to repaint the distinctive red and white stripes and that it would have to be left to return to its natural granite grey. It stated that because boats now have high tech navigational systems the day marker stripes are no longer essential. However, a sponsored campaign to keep the stripes was launched in October 2011. The required ¬£27,000 was raised. The tower repainting was completed in October using a team including two abseilers. Five coats of paint were applied to the copper lantern at the top and three on each hoop of the tower. In 2019 with the impending demolition of the Royal Sovereign Lighthouse, Trinity House has said it will increase the strength of Beachy Heads light to compensate for the loss of Royal Sovereign.

Commercially, it was one of Lloyd's most successful films and the 12th highest-grossing film of the silent era, pulling in $2,600,000.  Plot  Millionaire J. Harold Manners (Harold Lloyd) finds himself in the poor part of town one day. When he accidentally sets fire to a charity pushcart dispensing free coffee and owned by do-gooder Brother Paul (Paul Weigel), he pulls out his checkbook to cover the damage. Brother Paul, who was talking to another person about his dream to build a mission, assumes he wants to pay for the mission and tells him $1000. Though he finds that a rather hefty amount for a mere pushcart, Manners pays without complaint. Once Manners reads in the newspaper that he is sponsoring a mission, he goes there to dissociate himself from it. He is aghast to find it named the J. Harold Manners Mission. When he starts to tear down the sign, he is scolded by Brother Paul's pretty daughter, Hope (Jobyna Ralston), who does not know who he is. Far from being offended, he is smitten with her. Thus, when Brother Paul returns and invites him inside to tour the place, he readily accepts. Hope, once she learns his identity, apologizes. In order to build up attendance, Manners runs through town provoking people, and winds up with a crowd chasing him right into the mission. Some of the men are in possession of the proceeds of a jewel robbery. Before they can beat him up, however, the police arrive. The quick-witted Manners takes up a \\"collection\\"; the crooks deposit their loot in the hat he is using while the police search everybody. This act earns him the friendship of the gang. He eventually wins the girl and they decide to get married at the mission. His high-brow friends decide to kidnap him, believing they are saving him from a terrible mistake. As they drive away, one of them tells the wedding's \\"reception committee\\" that Manners is not going to marry Hope. The disappointed committeemen get drunk. Then their leader decides to go to Manner's club to confirm the news. They free Manners and head back to the mission. Manners has his hands full shepherding five drunks, but finally gets them all there and marries Hope.  Production  In the late 1920s, Lloyd alternated between making what he called \\"gag pictures\\" and \\"character pictures\\". This was a \\"gag picture\\". This was the first Lloyd film distributed by Paramount Pictures, and was a difficult production for Lloyd and his film company. Numerous scenes were filmed and later cut from the released version. Some of the cut elements, especially an underworld theme, were incorporated into Lloyd's 1928 film Speedy. Lloyd was somewhat disappointed in the final product, and considered shelving the picture. However, it grossed over 2 million dollars upon release.

The Missionaries form an international religious congregation of women representing 79 nationalities spread over 74 countries on five continents.  Foundation  Mother Mary of the Passion, a novice of the Sisters of Mary Reparatrix, a congregation dedicated to the training of women in the spirit of St. Ignatius of Loyola, had been sent in 1865 from France to the Apostolic Vicariate of Madurai in British India, which was under the administration of the Society of Jesus. They had been requested to help train a native congregation of religious sisters. After her religious profession the following year, she was appointed the Provincial Superior of the houses of the congregation in that country. A dissension in the ecclesiastical Province which Mother Mary had previously worked to resolve arose again. As a result, 20 of the Sisters left the congregation, including Mother Mary of the Passion. They gathered in a convent in Ootacamund, which Mother Mary of the Passion had recently established. They formed a new community there under the authority of the local Vicar Apostolic. These women resolved to form a new congregation, and Mother Mary of the Passion traveled to Rome that November to seek permission for this from the Holy See. She obtained this from Pope Pius IX on 6 January 1877, under the name of Missionaries of Mary. Unlike the instruction focus of the Sisters of Mary Reparatrix, the Missionaries would carry out a ministry of providing medical care to the women of India who were unable to receive it from male doctors, due to the practice of purdah, which strictly segregated them from contact with men. Mother Mary of the Passion had seen the consequences and felt called to deal with the situation. As women themselves, they would have access to the parts of the home restricted to females. The Sacred Congregation of the Propaganda Fide, which supervised all Church activities in non-Catholic territories, suggested to her that she open a novitiate in her native France, to train recruits for the new congregation. In keeping with this, one was opened in Saint-Brieuc, and new vocations to the Missionaries came quickly. Mother Mary of the Passion had to return to Rome in 1880 to resolve issues about the new foundation. She had to make yet another voyage there in June 1882. This one was to be a turning point in the identity of the Missionaries. Firstly, they were granted permission to open a house in Rome itself. Secondly, Mother Mary of the Passion came into contact with Bernardino of Portogruaro, the Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor (The Franciscans). Under his guidance, on 4 October that year (the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi), she was admitted to the Third Order of St. Francis, which was a return to the Franciscan vocation to which she had felt called when she was briefly a candidate in a monastery of the Poor Clares early in her life. The new congregation formally adopted the Rule of the Franciscan Third Order Regular on 15 August 1885. At that time they took the name of Franciscan Missionaries of Mary.  Expansion  Chapel St. Joan of Arc, mother house in Paris. Education by the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary in Belgian Congo (circa 1930) The work of the Franciscan Missionaries quickly spread to other countries, including China. It was there, in 1900, that 7 Franciscan Missionaries of Mary were murdered during the Boxer Rebellion, in which missionaries throughout that country were killed. These Sisters were canonized in A.D. 2000 as among the Martyrs of China. By the time of Mother Mary of the Passion's death in 1904, there were 88 communities serving in 24 countries around the globe, serving a variety of services for women and children. There was a mission at Fantome Island, near Palm Island, Queensland as well as a leprosarium. =United States= In November 1903, seven sisters from Canada, Ireland and France arrived in Worcester, Massachusetts, in response to a request for sisters to minister among the many immigrant families from Canada. The following year, Bishop Matthew Harkins of the Diocese of Providence invited them to come to Woonsocket to serve families who worked in the mills.Higgins FMM, Rosemarie. \\"The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary\\", Rhode Island Catholic, September 17, 2015 In 1937 the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary assumed responsibility for the McMahon Memorial Temporary Shelter, where children forcibly removed from homes would be housed until more permanent situations could be found.

The diaspora is found within the United Kingdom, and in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, Mexico, Panama, South Africa, the Samoas and Brazil. Background Cornish emigration was caused by a number of factors, mainly economic, notably a lack of work in the 18th and 19th centuries. During this period many Cornish people or ‚ÄúCousin Jacks‚Äù, as they were known, migrated to other parts of the world in search of a better life.\\"Cousin Jacks\\" is a nickname for the overseas Cornish, thought to derive from the practice of Cornishmen asking if job vacancies could be filled by their cousin named Jack in Cornwall. (1) (2) Many skilled miners sought the opportunity to find work abroad, as a consequence of the decline of the tin and copper mining industries in Cornwall. It is estimated that 250,000 Cornish migrated abroad between 1861 and 1901. These emigrants included merchants, tradesmen, and sailors (as Cornwall is a peninsula in the Atlantic Ocean), but were in the main miners. There is a common saying in Cornwall that \\"a mine is a hole anywhere in the world with at least one Cornishman at the bottom of it!\\" The Cornish economy profited from the miners‚Äô work abroad. Some men sent back ‚Äúhome pay‚Äù, which helped to keep their families out of the workhouse. As well as their mining skills, the Cornish emigrants carried their culture and way of life with them when they travelled. They formed tight-knit communities, and maintained some contact with the people and/or the customs of their homeland. Wrestling competitions took place in the new settlements, Cornish Methodist chapels were constructed. Pasties and saffron cakes became known to many natives of Australia, the Caribbean, and the United States. In areas where there are no mines, this may be due to Cornish seamen among the crews of British Royal Navy vessels. In some locations the playing of brass bands and the singing of Cornish carols, shows an example of Cornish culture's influence. Rugby union was played overseas by the Cornish miners, this helped develop the game in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Teams from these nations have returned the compliment, and have played in Cornwall (New Zealand 1905, 1924, Australia 1908, South Africa 1906, 1912 and the MƒÅori in 1926). Specific locations Today, in many native Anglophone and some Hispanic countries, among others, some of the descendants of these original migrants still celebrate their Cornish ancestry. This is evidenced by the existence of both Cornish societies and Cornish festivals in these countries, as well as a growing overseas interest in the Cornish language. Many of those with Cornish ancestry are now reviving their heritage and a plethora of Cornish family history and genealogy groups exist. =Australia= A statue commemorating Cornish and German miners in Bendigo, Victoria, Australia Today the most famous area of Cornish culture, called 'Australia's Little Cornwall', is the area in South Australia known as the Copper Triangle. This mining area in the northern Yorke Peninsula, including the principal towns of Moonta, Kadina and Wallaroo, was a significant source of prosperity for colonial South Australia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In its heyday Moonta was South Australia's second largest town after Adelaide and was predominately settled by Cornish miners and their families. Today Moonta is most famous for its traditional Cornish pasties and its Cornish style mine engine houses. Many descendants of these Cornish families still live in the Copper Triangle and are intensely proud of their Cornish heritage. Many of the original miners' cottages made from wattle and daub still stand and are still lived in by local residents, and many streets and houses have Cornish names. In Moonta today, the Kernewek Lowender (Cornish for \\"Cornish happiness\\") is the largest Cornish festival in the world and attracts more than 40,000 visitors each event. The South Australian the town of Burra also has Cornish connections. Burra began with the discovery of copper in 1845, by shepherds Thomas Pickett and William Streair. A number of townships soon developed - the South Australian Mining Association town of Kooringa, plus Redruth (Cornish) Aberdeen (Scottish) Llywchwr (Welsh) and Hampton (English). This former copper mining town is listed on the National Estate Register and also declared a State Heritage Area. The great Burra Jinker holds pride of place in Market Square. It was once pulled by some 40 bullocks, four abreast. Straining to the vivid exhortations of six bullock drivers under the leadership of William Woollacott, they hauled the massive jinker for three months, on a 100-mile journey from Adelaide. In April 2001 the Jinker was included in the BankSA Heritage Icons List. An example of the extent of the Cornish diaspora are the miners who worked at the Geraldine mine in Western Australia and had an influence on the nearby town of Northampton. Their produce was shipped out of Port Gregory, Western Australia in small vessels like the tramp steamer SS Xantho and then transhipped to the port of Geraldton where it was loaded onto wool ships bound for England as a form of 'paying ballast'.McDonald, G. K. The Little Boat Harbour: history of Port Gregory. WA Museum, Fremantle. Two of Australia's prime ministers are known to have Cornish ancestry. Robert Menzies was partially Cornish, while Bob Hawke was entirely of Cornish descent. In addition, at least six Premiers of South Australia have been of Cornish origin. Ruse, New South Wales was named after James Ruse, known as Australia's first farmer, who had been transported from Cornwall. =Brazil= Cornish miners played a major role in gold mining in imperial Brazil. The Gongo Soco gold mine, operated by the Imperial Brazilian Mining Association of Cornwall using skilled Cornish miners, produced over of gold between 1826 and 1856. Of particular note was Cornish miner Thomas Bawden (Scorrier, 1814-Mariana, Brazil, 1886), who had migrated to Brazil as a young man to make his fortune, and who on June 1, 1859 bought, for a very modest price, the gold ore exploring rights of \\"Mina da Passagem\\" (in Mariana, the first city and first capital of Minas Gerais Province), then believed to be practically exhausted, from the estate of then recently deceased mineralogy pioneer Baron von Eschwege (Wilhelm Ludwig Freiherr von Eschwege, a German engineer who had been charged by the King, D. Jo√£o VI, to survey Brazilian mineral resources and establish ways of exploitation. See Eschwege's book: Pluto Brasiliensis). After more than four years managing the enterprise, Bawden, now a successful businessman, sold the whole of it, for a remarkably high price, to the newly constituted single-purpose business \\"Anglo-Brazilian Gold Mining Company\\", managed by the experienced Thomas Treloar (Sithney, 1814-London, 1880), who also came from Cornwall. The company received, in 1867, the official visit of Sir Richard Francis Burton, former Africa and Middle East explorer, then acting as consul to Brazil within the British diplomatic service. Consul Burton, a renowned linguist and intellectual as well, described (in the book Explorations of the Highlands of Brazil, 1869) how he had found there a large Cornish community, whose church services included hymns sung in the Cornish language, and had witnessed their eccentric rite of \\"Baptism for the dead\\", based on the apostle Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians 15:29. The \\"Anglo-Brazilian\\" project turned out to be a success and, using newly developed Cornish gold extraction engineering technologies, the \\"Mina da Passagem\\" eventually kept producing large amounts of gold for around ninety years more. =Canada= A Cornish water wheel in British Columbia The oldest and largest area of settlement from the West Country in Canada is that of the northern shore of Newfoundland, also known as the French Shore, due to competing fishing rights. The Cornish made up a significant part of this population, which is noticeable in the local dialect to this day. There are also significant populations of Cornish descent in other areas of Atlantic Canada, in particular, Prince Edward Island. In Ontario, Oshawa and the surrounding Ontario County were the settling grounds of a large number of 19th century Cornish immigrants during the Cornish emigration which considerably reduced Cornwall's population, although these were largely agricultural workers, rather than miners. There were also major Cornish settlements in the Prairie provinces, and on Vancouver Island. Cornish ethnicity is recognised on the Canadian census, and in 2006 1,550 Canadians listed their ethnic origin as Cornish. The name of Cornwall, Ontario however does not indicate settlement by Cornish people since it was named after one of the Dukes of Cornwall (its flag and coat of arms are therefore based on elements from the Duchy of Cornwall). =Mexico= A Cornish mine in Mineral del Monte, Hidalgo, Mexico In the State of Hidalgo in central Mexico a local speciality originates from the Cornish pasty, called pastes which was introduced by miners and workers from Cornwall who were contracted in the silver mining towns of Mineral del Monte and Pachuca. The majority of migrants to this region came from what we now term the Cornish \\"central mining district\\" of Camborne and Redruth. Mineral del Monte's steep streets, stairways and small squares are lined with low buildings and many houses with high sloping roofs and chimneys which indicate a Cornish influence. It was the Cornish who first introduced football to Pachuca and indeed Mexico, as well as other popular sports such as Rugby union, Tennis, Cricket, Polo, and Chess, while Mexican remittances helped to build the Wesleyan Chapel in Redruth the 1820s. The twin silver mining settlements of Pachuca and Real del Monte are being marketed in 2007 as 'Mexico's Little Cornwall' by the Mexican Embassy in London and represent the first attempt by the Spanish speaking part of the Cornish diaspora to establish formal links with Cornwall. The Mexican Embassy in London is also trying to establish a town twinning arrangement with Cornwall. In 2008 thirty members of the Cornish Mexican Cultural Society travelled to Mexico to try and re-trace the path of their ancestors who set off from Cornwall to start a new life in Mexico. =New Zealand= During the 1870s and 1880s, New Zealand had an immigrant drive spearheaded by Sir Julius Vogel of the New Zealand Government. At that time Vogel recognised that the young colony needed labourers, farmers and domestic servants to \\"bring the country in\\". Vogel initiated the Vogel Immigration Scheme (1871‚Äì1888) in which any New Zealand resident could nominate any British resident to immigrate to New Zealand for free if they qualified under the criteria. The criteria was for fit, healthy, young people with primarily labouring, farming or domestic servant skills. The recruiters were told to focus on Cornish and Scots who were known for their hard work ethic and were therefore deemed particularly ideal for colonial life. As the timing coincided with the downturn of the Cornish tin market, a large number of Cornish took up the offer. Many Cornish went to Auckland, Wellington, or Lyttelton (Christchurch), New Zealand. Many Scots went to Dunedin, New Zealand. Peak immigration under the scheme occurred between 1872 and 1874. Records of those who emigrated under the scheme still exist and can be searched at most large New Zealand public libraries. =Pitcairn Islands and Norfolk Island= One of the nine mutineers who arrived on the Pitcairn Islands in 1790,https://mcfarlandbooks.com/product/pitcairn-island-the-bounty- mutineers-and-their-descendants/ Matthew Quintal, was a Cornish man.https://web.archive.org/web/20080518011348/http://www.lareau.org/quintal.html He was one of the only mutineers to have children before his death, being partially responsible for the island continuing to have a population after the deaths of all the original arrivals on . Consequently, due to the island's small and often intermingling population, which has experienced very little change in several hundred years,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/pitcairnislands/11418280/Why- will-nobody-move-to-Pitcairn-the-Pacific-island-with-free-land.html most of its inhabitants partially descend from him to this day. Due to a number of inhabitants of Pitcairn being moved to Norfolk Island in later years, a significant number of his descendants carrying Cornish ancestry live here too.https://www.discovernorfolkisland.com/norfolk/pitcairn.html =South Africa= During the gold rush period on the Witwatersrand many Cornishmen went to the then South African Republic (also known as the Transvaal) in order to seek their fortune. In fact, the pioneering of the Rand gold reef was largely down to the hardrock mining expertise that Cornishmen brought with them from their native country, where tin and copper had been obtained from granite for many centuries. By the end of the 19th century the sheer numbers of Cornish miners on the Rand, sending up to ¬£1 million a year back to Cornwall, even caused friction with the Kruger government which resented the wealth these \\"uitlanders\\" were sending home. The Kruger government's decision to tax these so-called uitlanders without any kind of legislative representation was one of the many reasons behind the outbreak of the Second Boer War. \\"Cousin Jack\\", as the Cornishman was known, also brought a strong rugby tradition, the Cornish pasty and a few other elements of Cornish culture to South Africa that can still be found today. Indeed, there is an area known as New Redruth in Johannesburg and one area of Soweto bears a Cornish language name, Baragwanath. Later Cornish migration to South Africa could be viewed as part of a more general trend of emigration from the British Isles and is thus harder to gauge. The prevalence of Cornish surnames, e.g. Tregowning, amongst people of all races, especially in the Cape of Good Hope, is further testimony to the Cornish contribution to South Africa. =United Kingdom= Cornish people have also moved to a number of other parts of England and the rest of the United Kingdom. Close to the Cornish county border with Devon is the naval city of Plymouth which has had an influx of Cornish people since time immemorial and, during the rise of Devonport Dockyard, was a main source of income for many of the Cornish. Historically the surname Cornish/Cornishe/Cornyshe was given to a Cornish person who had left Cornwall and this surname can be found throughout the British Isles. Today there are significant Cornish populations in Plymouth, Bristol and the capital, London, which is also home to London Cornish RFC. Within Great Britain, Cornish families were attracted from Cornwall to North East England‚Äî-particularly on Teesside, East Cleveland‚Äî-to partake in ironstone and alum mining as a means to earn wealth by using their mining skill. This has resulted in a concentration of Cornish names on and around Teesside that persists into the 21st century. Other areas settled by Cornish miners were Roose in Cumbria and parts of south Wales. In addition Cornish farming families took advantage of cheap agricultural land to relocate to north west Essex, specifically the Great Dunmow area, where the surrounding villages of Stebbing and Lindsell boast descendants with Cornish surnames such as Lanyon, Menhinick and Trembath. =United States= A \\"Cousin Jack's\\" pasty shop in Grass Valley, California Cover of \\"One and All\\": an autobiography of Richard Tangye, of the Cornwall Works, Birmingham Aerial view of the Copper Triangle, South Australia, looking roughly west. Kadina is in the centre (inland), Wallaroo and Moonta on the coast (right and left, respectively) There are estimated to be close to 2 million people of Cornish descent in the US. Cornish culture continues to have an influence in the Copper Country located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin and the Iron Ranges of northern Michigan and Minnesota, as well as in the major copper mining district of Butte, Montana. In Grass Valley, California, the tradition of singing Cornish carols lives on and one local historian of the area says the songs have become ‚Äúthe identity of the town‚Äù. Some of the members of today‚Äôs Cornish Carol Choir are in fact descendants of the original Cornish gold miners. Statues and monuments in many towns pay tribute to the influence of the Cornish on their development. Some inhabitants of Tangier Island, Virginia, a former Cornish fishing settlement, have a Cornish accent that traces back to the Cornish settlers who settled there in 1686.

Career After spending the mid-1960s in London, he reputedly became acquainted with the Rolling Stones' circle of friends. Calling himself \\"Acid King Dave,\\" he allegedly participated in a government drug set-up of Jagger and Richards, resulting in the infamous 'Redlands' bust. Later he moved to Los Angeles, where he would be based for the rest of his life. He may have been best known as the creator of the early 1980s music program, New Wave Theatre, hosted by Peter Ivers, which gained notoriety in the early days of cable television. It was shown as part of USA Network's late night weekend variety show, Night Flight. \\"New Wave Theatre\\" was co-written by longtime Jove collaborator and former Billboard editor Ed Ochs, who also wrote the liner notes to Jove's two records, \\"Sweeter Song\\" and \\"Into the Shrine\\" (co-writing \\"Never Say Never\\" on \\"Shrine\\"). Ochs also co- wrote Jove's only feature film, \\"Stranger Than Love\\" (originally \\"I Married My Mom!\\"), and, with Jove, formed one half of Oxygen, a studio band which fused rock and disco and in 1979 recorded an EP of six original Jove/Ochs songs, \\"The Bones of Hollywood\\". Jove met music video producer Paul Flattery at a 1983 New York Billboard Video conference and formed an association which resulted in the music video \\"Stop in the Name Of Love\\" for the reformed English band The Hollies, with Graham Nash and the TV show \\"The Top,\\" which came about after Peter Ivers' murder. In the immediate aftermath of Iver's killing, Jove was offered help by producer/director/writer Harold Ramis, a friend of Ivers, and together with Flattery, created and made \\"The Top\\" for KTLA. The show was a mixture of live music, videos and humor. Performers on the series include such artists as Cyndi Lauper, who performed \\"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\\" and \\"True Colors,\\" The Hollies performed \\"Stop in the Name Of Love\\" and The Romantics performed \\"Talking in Your Sleep\\" and \\"What I Like About You\\". Guest stars included Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. The host was Chevy Chase, who ‚Äì dressed as a \\"punk\\" of the era‚Äîgot into a physical altercation with an audience member during the opening monologue. He immediately left the taping. The producers then got Andy Kaufman to fill in for Chase and recorded the host segments at a separate, later, session. It was to be the last professional appearance by Andy Kaufman before his death. \\"The Top\\" aired on Friday January 27, 1984 at 7 ‚Äì 8pm. It scored a 7.7% rating and a 14% share. This represented a 28% rating increase and a 27% share increase over KTLA's regularly scheduled \\"Happy Days/LaVerne & Shirley.\\" In 2012, Ed Ochs released his memoir about Jove, \\"Freedom Spy: David Jove and The Meaning of Existence.\\" The book detailed Ochs' experience with Jove. Personal life Jove was married to actress and comedian Lotus Weinstock. Their daughter is actress and musician Lili Haydn. Haydn was an accomplished violinist at a young age, playing locally in Hollywood, CA. Jove claimed extreme fondness for Lili's music and talent and invited friends to meet him at her performances, although few were told it was his daughter they were listening to. Death Jove was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer just before he died in 2004, aged 61, in Los Angeles.

Sujatha, Karunas and Ramesh Khanna play pivotal roles in the film, while the score and soundtrack are composed by Bharathwaj. Plot The movie begins with Jeeva (Ajith Kumar), a driving instructor, leading a happy life with his mother (Sujatha). He also fell in love with Swapna (Pooja Umashankar) after several mishaps. Sujatha hides the Jeeva truth that his father (Nizhalgal Ravi), was murdered by a dada named Manthiram (Babu Antony). The mother, much against the boy‚Äôs wish, packs off Jeeva‚Äôs twin brother, Guru (also Ajith Kumar) with a family who offer to adopt him, who had been witness to the murderer from a close quarter, to a distant town. He escapes from the family and goes to Tuticorin and grows to become a gangster there. When Jeeva visits Tuticorin, he comes across his elder brother, Guru a.k.a. Thala. Seizing the opportunity, the elder brother kidnaps the younger one and decides to go as the driving instructor to Chennai. Initially, he plans to take revenge on his mother for packing him off from their house at a very young age. He hurts her at every step and even plans to sell off all their property. On the other hand, Jeeva is mistaken as the gangster and is subject to attacks by the local gangsters of Tuticorin. He escapes from them and returns to Chennai to save his mother. In the meantime, Guru comes to know about his father's death and Manthiram was the cause for the same. He avenges his father's death and leaves Jeeva with his mother to live happily and goes off to jail to keep his mother in belief that he is somewhere in the world living happily.

Between then and 2004, the pair began shooting for another project for Poornachandra Rao titled Erumugam also starring Richa Pallod, before Ajith Kumar pulled out and the pair subsequently fell out. However Ajith Kumar's wife played a role in reconciling the pair and Saran worked on a fresh script for the actor. Kiran was initially roped in to play a second leading female role after her other film opposite Ajith Kumar, Mahaa, was shelved but Saran later deleted her character from the project. The shooting progressed in October 2004 around Tuticorin and a scene created a ruckus among the public as they mistook the action to be real, as the region had seen similar daylight murders and fights among local mafia in the past.

He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 9 April 1997. He departed on 22 May 1998, before making a two- episode guest appearance the following month. Casting Upon graduating from Deakin University with a BA degree in Drama, Cousins took on a 50-word guest role on Neighbours as an Attendant in a scene where established character Billy Kennedy went bungee jumping. When the producers rang Cousins several months later to offer him the more substantial role of Ben Atkins he accepted. Cousins in an interview with TV Week, \\"I could hardly believe it when they rang and said I had the part, \\"It‚Äôs a big jolt, I‚Äôve been used to leading a student‚Äôs life until now. But I enjoy it so much. I can get up at 5 am with a smile on my face, and sail into work every morning\\". Cousins became \\"a local hero\\" following his casting, as the show is filmed in his home city of Melbourne. Cousins developed a close bond with Ailsa Piper, who plays Ben's mother Ruth Wilkinson, and he described her as his surrogate mother. He explained, \\"When I got the part, everyone told me how vicious and cut-throat the TV industry was. But when I arrived at the studio on my first day, Ailsa ran up to me, gave me this huge hug and said 'Welcome!'. It was definitely a great start!\\" In a 1998 interview with The Weekly News, Cousins detailed how winning the role of Ben left him feeling under constant pressure. He found it difficult to cope with the fame and recognition. Development Following his arrival, Ben moves into Number 30 Ramsay Street and he hides a secret, which has something to do with Ruth Wilkinson (Piper). It was later revealed that Ruth was Ben's biological mother. Piper was surprised by the development, saying \\"I'll never forget the time they told me I was going to have a 21-year- old son and I'd been pregnant at 16. I'd been hiding it all this time.\\" Piper liked that the storyline led to some \\"meaty scenes\\" between Ruth and Ben, and that another side to her character was finally shown. Cousins later explained that Ben's introductory storyline inspired a young female fan to get in contact with her real mother. He said, \\"It was very sobering to me to know that as an actor you can have that sort of impact on people's lives. I'm really moved by this girl's letters. They're a reminder to me that for every difficult thing that Neighbours brings you as a cast member, it brings 10 times more rewards.\\" Ben's younger sister Caitlin Atkins (Emily Milburn) was later introduced to show. Caitlin causes various problems for Ben with her troublesome behaviour, such as making up stories about his childhood and spending a number of nights \\"out on the town.\\" Cousins sympathised with his character, as he has two younger sisters himself. He used his experiences to aid his research for the scenes with Milburn. He also admitted there were \\"quite a few similarities to the Caitlin thing\\", but his sisters were not as bad as her. The last episode to air in Australia before the show's annual Christmas break saw Ben involved in \\"a horrific car smash\\" during a motor race. The stunt was the most expensive scene in the show's history at the time. Cousins thought it was a great end to the year, and was grateful that his stunt double took over during filming. As viewers were left with a cliffhanger, Cousins had to deal with people asking him what the outcome for Ben would be. He later visited the UK just as the same episode aired there, and had to deal with the same questions for a second time. Ben is left in a coma following the accident. After he wakes up, Ben is discharged from the hospital, but he is not full recovered and it takes time for him to \\"piece his shattered life back together.\\" While he was in the hospital, Ben was visited by a stranger, who Ruth realises is his father Geoff Burke (Andrew McKaige), the man who left her when she fell pregnant. Piper commented that Ruth wants to hit him, as he has never taken an interest in Ben until now. Ruth refuses to let Geoff tell Ben who he is, as she thinks Ben will relapse. The storyline marked Ben's departure from the show, as Cousins filmed his final scenes in April 1998. Ben later returns to Erinsborough for Ruth and Philip Martin's (Ian Rawlings) wedding. Storylines Ben grows up in Adelaide with his parents and siblings Nick (Jason Crewes) and Caitlin. His interest in cars leads him to pursue a career as a mechanic. When Ben discovers he is adopted, he decides to try to find his real mother and leaves Adelaide for Erinsborough. Ben arrives in Ramsay Street after responding to an advertisement for the spare room at Number 30. He encounters his birth mother Ruth, when she literally runs into him after practising rollerblading. Ben soon discovers Ruth has two more children, his half-siblings Anne (Brooke Satchwell) and Lance Wilkinson (Andrew Bibby). After settling in, Ben makes several friends in the area. When Anne develops a crush on Ben, it puts a strain on her relationship with Billy Kennedy (Jesse Spencer). Ben realises he has to tell her the truth about being her half-brother even if it means hurting her. Anne refuses to believe it when Ben confesses. After Ben reveals the truth about his identity to Ruth, she explains that she was fifteen when she gave birth to him. She wanted to keep him, but her parents forced her to give him up for adoption. Ben understands this and Ruth and Lance are generally accepting of him, Anne however is slower to come around to idea and is still hurt by Ruth keeping the secret. Anne later relents after plans to move in with her father Bill (Ian Stanley Pearce) and his girlfriend fall through. Ben later takes a job working for Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver), who buys an old bus to use as a mobile restaurant. This is short-lived as the bus is later burned out by Jamie-Lee Duggan (Josephine Clark) leaving Ben out of work. However, Lou buys a local garage and asks Ben if he wants a partnership in the business. Ben accepts but later has seconds thoughts when Lou begins treating him more like an employee than a partner. Lou's friend, Philip, who is dating Ruth, comes up with a solution that sees Lou and Ben have a 49% share apiece and he looks after the other 2%. After Ben overhears a telephone conversation between housemate Lisa Elliot (Kate Straub) and her mother, he mistakenly believes she is in love with him and on the night of her leaving party, he kisses her, much to her surprise. Lisa, flattered, explains she was referring to his mechanical skills and tells him she would be interested in a relationship, if she was not about to leave. Ben then falls for Angela Quinton (Fiona McGregor), whom he met at a night club. Within days, he fixes Angela's car for free and offers her Lisa's old room. But just before she moves in, Ben's other housemate Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) breaks the news to him that Angela had got back together with her ex-boyfriend. Ben and Sarah continue searching for potential tenants but none are suitable until policeman Matt Compton (Jonathon Kovac) applies for the spare room. Ben is hesitant at first but Sarah manages to persuade him to let Matt move in. Within days of moving, things are strained between when the guys when Matt pulls Ben up for failure to renew his driving license on time. Things get even worse between the two when Matt suspects Ben of having dodgy cars in the garage, and begins dating Sarah, making Ben feel like a gooseberry in his own home. However, their mutual love of motor racing brings Ben and Matt together and they become friends just before Matt leaves for a new post in Port Campbell. When Ben's adoptive parents move to the Middle East temporarily, he is left to care for his younger sister, Caitlin. Ben struggles to act in the role of guardian as Caitlin finds it difficult to settle in and is used to having things done for her, as opposed to living in a share house environment. Ben takes his interest in motor racing for the next level and begins spending more and more time at the race track. Lou offers his support but Ben finds it difficult to be competitive, even when goaded by rival racer Steve Van Eck (Daniel Tobias). After Barry Sheene has a few words of encouragement to Ben, he gets the motivation he needs. The day of the big race arrives, and many of the Ramsay Street residents show up at Calder Park Raceway to support Ben. As the race begins, Ben begins doing well and manages to hold his place, but is preoccupied with spotting where Steve is in the line-up. Ben fails to notice a car pull out from the pits right in front of him and they collide. The car flips over and bursts into flames. Ben is cut free from the wreck and rushed to hospital. Ben's family await news all night. Ben's operation is a success but he remains comatose. A mysterious stranger visits Ben, sitting by his bedside and talking to him. The stranger is Geoff Burke, Ben's biological father who read about the incident in the newspaper. Geoff admits his identity to a comatose Ben. After waking up, Ben has no memory of this and Ruth wants it kept that way. Ben is irate when finds out that Geoff was in fact his father, and not a hospital worker as he had believed and he rejects him. However, he realises how lucky he is to be alive and have the chance to get to know both of his natural parents. When Ben is discharged from hospital, He agrees to stay with his family next door after he realizes he would be too much of a burden for his housemates. Geoff decides to stay on and help take care of his son, while getting to know him. Ben finds life challenging when he has to adjust to using a zimmer frame. One day, he falls when getting out of the bath and is forced to wait for Anne to come home to assist him. However, he manages to maintain a positive attitude. Ben's recovery takes a setback when Geoff shows him a video of the crash. When Ben begins to make progress, Geoff decides to return to his family in Sydney and tells Ben he is welcome there any time. After Ben recovers, he returns to Number 30 which is overcrowded with his older brother, Nick (who came to help with Caitlin) and Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) having moved in during his absence. Ben tries to adjust to sharing a room with Nick, but is unable due to his brother's snoring. Geoff later offers Ben a job running his garage in Sydney and he takes him up on it. Ben is worried about leaving Ruth, but she assures him he needs to get to know Geoff. Ben leaves after a farewell Barbecue. The following month, Ben returns for Ruth's wedding to Philip. In early 1999, Ben later phones Anne and Lance to congratulate them on their exam results. Reception For his portrayal of Ben, Cousins earned a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 1998 Inside Soap Awards. The episode featuring Ben's confession about his identity won Best Episode in a Television Drama Serial at the 1997 Australian Film Institute Awards. The award was given to the director of the episode, Peter Dodds. After his arrival, a Daily Record reporter observed the female characters at Number 30 were \\"bowled over by their new flatmate\\". A writer for the same publication noted that Angela's departure \\"plunges Ben into deep despair\\". Stephen Murphy of Inside Soap wrote, \\"You've got to feel sorry for Ben Atkins. Once a happy-go-lucky chap, the likeable mechanic has become a shadow of his former self since his sister Caitlin arrived in town.\\" A writer for the BBC's official Neighbours website stated that Ben's most memorable moment was \\"Being in a coma after a car accident.\\" References External links *Ben Atkins at BBC Online Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional mechanics Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional racing drivers Category:Television characters introduced in 1997 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Ben Atkins"},{"id":"5045280","text":"King Chadae of Goguryeo (71-165, r. 146-165) was the seventh ruler of Goguryeo, the northernmost of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

The type species Nyasasaurus parringtoni was first described in 1956 in the doctoral thesis of English paleontologist Alan J. Charig, but it was not formally described until 2013. Previously, the oldest record of dinosaurs was from Argentina and dated back to the late Carnian stage, about 231.4 million years ago. Nyasasaurus comes from a deposit that dates back to the Anisian stage, meaning that it predates other early dinosaurs by about 12 million years. History of study In the 1930s, the holotype of Nyasasaurus was collected in Parrington's locality B36 from the Lifua Member of the Manda Formation, Ruhuhu Basin near Lake Nyasa in southern Tanzania by Francis Rex Parrington. Other fossils from the same locality included those of cynodonts, dicynodonts, and rhynchosaurs. Most, including those of Nyasasaurus, consist only of fragments of bone. The remains were first described in English paleontologist Alan J. Charig's 1956 doctoral thesis and referred to as \\"Specimen 50b\\".Charig, A.J., 1956, New Triassic archosaurs from Tanganyika, including Mandasuchus and Teleocrater. Dissertation, Cambridge University In 1967 Charig used the name Nyasasaurus parringtoni, in a review of Archosauria, but without any description, so it was commonly considered a nomen nudum; the dissertation was also never published.Charig, A. J. (1967). \\"Archosauria,\\" in The Fossil Record: A Symposium with Documentation, Geological Society of London pp 708‚Äì718 The generic name referred to Lake Nyasa and the specific name honouring Parrington. In 2013 a new description was published by Sterling Nesbitt, Paul Barrett, Sarah Werning and Christian Sidor, including the late Charig as posthumous co-author, ensuring the validity of the name Nyasasaurus parringtoni. The generic name is occasionally misspelled as \\"Nyasaurus\\", as by Theodore Elmer White in 1973. The referred specimen of Nyasasaurus, SAM- PK-K10654, was collected by G. M. Stockley in the early 1930s in the western portion of the Manda Formation at Stockley's locality B27. This locality is listed as a locality from the \\"Upper Bone Bed\\" of the Manda Formation (currently understood to be from the Lifua Member) by Haughton (1932). The specimen was collected under a single field number, S507, presumably from a small area. The specimen was probably associated as evidenced by the bone quality, color and surrounding matrix (dark gray to black carbonate). The consistent sizes of the remains indicate that they represent a single individual. Stockley's locality B27 is located near the village of Gingama and it was probably the only specimen found at this locality, although a nearby locality B26, also listed as Gingama, produced cynodonts, lungfish, amphibians, and a shark. Dicynodonts, cynodonts and archosaurs such as Asilisaurus were also found nearby in the Lifua Member. The name Thecodonotosaurus alophos was coined for this specimen by Haughton (1932). Its holotype consists of three cervical vertebrae and two middle to posterior dorsal vertebrae that are poorly preserved as they are highly fractured and parts of the bone and bone surfaces are eroded. Originally, a comparison of Thecodontosaurus alophos was made only with Coelophysis longicollis. Since then, the species has been largely ignored by all subsequent vertebrate workers and no formal diagnosis of the specimen was ever provided. Nesbitt et al. (2013) found the specimen to not be diagnostic because it does not have any autapomorphic features or a unique combination of characteristics. Therefore, they suggested to abandon the name Thecodonotosaurus alophos and to refer its specimen to Nyasasaurus parringtoni. Description The type specimen, NHMUK R6856, is a partial skeleton belonging to an individual estimated to have been two to three metres in length. It consists of a right humerus, three partial sacral vertebrae and three presacral vertebrae. A second specimen, SAM-PK-K10654 consisting of three cervical vertebrae and two posterior presacral vertebrae, is also known. It was attributed to the same species as NHMUK R6856 because the dorsal or back vertebrae of the two specimens are nearly identical. However, the vertebral features that link NHMUK R6856 and SAM-PK-K10654, including a connection between two bony projections called the hyposphene and hypantrum, are also found in other Triassic archosaurs. Since these characteristics are not unique to the two species they do not by themselves provide sufficient evidence for grouping NHMUK R6856 and SAM-PK-K10654 under the same species. The 2013 description of Nyasasaurus by Sterling Nesbitt, Paul Barrett, Sarah Werning and Christian Sidor used a second line of evidence, the similar positions of the two specimens on the evolutionary tree, to justify their placement as the same species. The study also mentioned the similarity between the presacral vertebrae of both specimens of Nyasasaurus parringtoni and those of the enigmatic avemetatarsalian archosaur, Teleocrater rhadinus. Additionally, the anterior cervical vertebra attributed to NHMUK PV R6795 is extremely elongated relative to that of the middle dorsal vertebrae with a low centrum to neural arch ratio and a significant displacement between the two sides of the articular facet of the centrum. However, it is probable that the limb bones and other elements included in NHMUK PV R6795 do not belong to the same individual. Therefore, it is possible that the vertebrae of Teleocrater rhadinus are also referable to Nyasasaurus parringtoni. An analysis of the interior structure of the humerus indicates that bone growth was rapid, with interwoven bone fibers, many channels for blood vessels that radiate in all directions, and few lines of arrested growth. This structure more closely matches that of the early dinosaur Coelophysis than it does of dinosaur ancestors, suggesting that Nyasasaurus was closer to the ancestry of dinosaurs than other archosaurs at the time. Classification Because it is based on incomplete remains, Nyasasaurus has been difficult to classify. It can be placed confidently within Archosauria, the group of reptiles represented today by crocodilians and birds, Dinosauria, the group of dinosaurs; and within Dinosauriformes, the group that includes birds, non-avian dinosaurs, and several non-dinosaurian groups from the Triassic. Nyasasaurus was suggested to have been a primitive prosauropod dinosaur in 1986,Ginsburg, L., 1986, \\"R√©gressions marines et extinction des Dinosaures\\", Les Dinosaures de la Chine √† la France, Colloque International de Pal√©ontologie, Toulouse, France, 2-6 Septembre 1985; Mus√©um d'Histoire Naturelle de Toulouse, Toulouse pp 141-149 but this hypothesis was disputed. The 2013 analysis suggests that Nyasasaurus may be the earliest known dinosaur, dating to the late Anisian stage, about 243 million years ago, 10 to 15 million years older than any previously described dinosaur, such as Herrerasaurus. Dinosaur affinities of the holotype are supported by the long deltopectoral crest on the humerus, an unambiguously dinosaur top, another feature present only in dinosaurs. The humerus does not share any synapomorphies exclusively with any other Triassic archosaur clade. The possession of three sacral vertebrae instead of two could represent a dinosaur plesiomorphy, but has a complex distribution among dinosauriforms. The elongated neck vertebrae with hollowed-out sides of the referred specimen provides two characters that are exclusive to the derived silesaurid Silesaurus (but absent in the earlier and more basal silesaurid Asilisaurus), and to early theropod dinosaurs. These characters can be interpreted as possibly homologous with features that represent unambiguously skeletal pneumaticity in theropods. Nyasasaurus is likely either a basal dinosaur or close to Dinosauria. Other phylogenetic analyses have indicated that the sister group to Dinosauria is a family of herbivorous dinosauriforms called Silesauridae. The fossil record of silesaurids dates back to the late Anisian (the silesaurid Asilisaurus is also known from the Manda Formation), suggesting that the first dinosaurs also appeared around this time. Before Nyasasaurus was recognized as a possible dinosaur, a long ghost lineage of approximately 16 million years existed between the earliest dinosaurs and earliest silesaurids. Nesbitt et al. (2013) incorporated both specimens, NHMUK R6856 and SAM-PK-K10654, into a phylogenetic analysis. This analysis was based on data from a 2011 analysis by Sterling Nesbitt that included many Triassic archosaurs. When NHMUK R6856 was added to the data set, several possible relationships were found. Various possible evolutionary trees place it as the sister taxon of Dinosauria, the most basal member of Ornithischia (the group that includes most herbivorous Mesozoic dinosaurs), or a member of Theropoda (the group that includes most carnivorous dinosaurs as well as birds). When SAM-PK-K10654 was added to the analysis, it was found to be a theropod. SAM- PK-K10654 possesses several theropod features, including deep pits or fossae in its neck vertebrae, which are not found in NHMUK R6856 because of the limited overlap between the specimens. The following cladogram depicts these possibilities: A large phylogenetic analysis of early dinosaurs and dinosauromorphs by Matthew Baron, David B. Norman and Paul Barrett (2017) found that Nyasasaurus may represent a derived member of Sauropodomorpha most closely related to massospondylids like Massospondylus and Lufengosaurus.Baron, M.G., Norman, D.B., and Barrett, P.M. (2017). A new hypothesis of dinosaur relationships and early dinosaur evolution. Nature, 543: 501‚Äì506. If the hypothesis is proven correct, then the divergence times of all major clades within Dinosauria will be pushed back 10 to 15 million years. In his 2018 thesis on dinosaur interrelationships, Matthew Baron cast doubt on the referral of \\"Thecodontosaurus\\" alophos to Nyasasaurus, arguing that SAM-PK-K10654 instead represents a neotheropod due to the lack of skeletal pneumaticity seen in massospondylids, which would push back the divergence time of neotheropods 10-15 mya.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Baron2/publication/323142682_The_Origin_and_Early_Evolution_of_the_Dinosauria/links/5a9545ce0f7e9ba4297176f6/The- Origin-and-Early-Evolution-of-the-Dinosauria.pdf  See also  * Eoraptor * Alwalkeria * Agnosphitys * Dinosaur evolution Contemporaries *Stenaulorhynchus  References  = Bibliography = * Lambert, David (1994).

The group operates at more than 500 sites with over 7,000 beds. Its flagship hospital is the Priory Hospital, Roehampton, which is best known for treating celebrities particularly for drug addiction. The Priory Group also manages schools, some for students with autism spectrum disorders through Priory Education and Children‚Äôs Services. Some of its facilities are run by its subsidiary Partnerships in Care. In January 2019 it opened its first overseas school in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge. Ownership In 1980 the Priory Hospital in Roehampton was acquired by Community Psychiatric, an American healthcare company, and became the first clinic in what was to become the Priory Group. The Priory Group was the subject of a management buyout, funded by Mercury Asset Management and several banks, in 1994. In 2000 Westminster Healthcare Group (a company owned by Dr Chai Patel) acquired Priory Hospitals from the management team and from Mercury Asset Management for ¬£96 million. In 2002, the company was the subject of another management buyout, this time led by Doughty Hanson & Co, for ¬£289 million. The company was divested to ABN AMRO (later acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland Group) in July 2005 for ¬£875 million, netting the five company directors over ¬£50 million. Advent International took control for an aggregate consideration of ¬£925 million in 2011. In October 2014, former Chief Executive, Tom Riall announced that the group was planning a significant expansion into the mental health community services market and would bid in partnership with ‚Äúincumbent‚Äù NHS providers, an approach that would allow them to come up with new models of care. Anticipating more services to be put out to tender by Clinical commissioning groups, he noted that Priory could contribute \\"considerable commercial bidding expertise‚Äù and become the ‚Äúoverflow provider of choice‚Äù for the NHS.

He was the third son of the eighth king Sindae and the younger brother of the ninth king Gogukcheon, who died without an heir. Background and rise to the throne Upon Gogukcheon's death, his queen Lady U supported Sansang's claim and had him placed on the throne.

Balgi, older brother to Sansang, led a rebel force attacking the capital, gaining military support of Chinese faction. Sansang had his younger brother Gyesu repel the attack, and Balgi committed suicide. Sansang Goguryeo was later attacked by Han Dynasty China and forced to submit to the Han Dynasty. In 209, the capital was moved to Jian by warlord Gongsun Kang of the Han Dynasty. In 217, he granted refuge to a thousand families from the Liaodong region. Successor In the eleventh lunar month of 208, the king chased a sacrificial boar to the village of Jutongchon, where he met a young woman and spent the day with her. The queen heard of this and sent royal forces, failing to kill her owing to her assertion that she conceived. The woman gave birth to a son and became a royal concubine. The son was made crown prince in 213 and later became King Dongcheon. Sansang died during 227, the 31st year of his reign, and was buried in Sansang-neung.

He was the younger brother of Anjang of Goguryeo, and is said to have been tall and wise. The other two of the Three Kingdoms, Baekje and Silla, formed an alliance in response to the Goguryeo threat, leading to a relatively balanced peace. In the only conflict during Anwon's reign, in the ninth lunar month of 540, Baekje laid siege to Usan Castle, but Anwon sent 5,000 cavalry and drove the attackers off. Goguryeo suffered many natural disasters during Anwon's reign, such as flooding, earthquakes, thunderstorms and a severe epidemic, a severe drought, a plague of locusts. Anwon's first queen had not given birth to a son. In his third year on the thone, he had designated as crown prince his eldest son by his second queen, prince Pyeongseong (subsequent king Yangwon). However, in the last year of Anwon's reign, there was a power struggle between his second and third queens who each sought to make her son the crown prince. The aristocracy split into two camps, leading to violent battles during which the king was apparently killed. This internal division was the beginning of a significantly weakening of the royal throne and Goguryeo itself in subsequent years.

During Yangwon's reign, Goguryeo gradually grew weaker and was obliged to take various urgent measures to block foreign invasions, eventually losing the Seoul region to the alliance of the other two Korean kingdoms. Life and reign He was confirmed as heir to the throne in 533, the third year of Anwon's reign. Although he was the heir, it is said that he was not able to simply assume power after his father's death. Anwon had three wives, and because the first did not bear him a son, the other queens strove to put their son on the throne. Yangwon's supporters won the military struggle and he was able to succeed to the throne. Preparing for war in 547, Yangwon rebuilt Baegam fortress and repaired Sin fortress. In 548, he sent 6,000 soldiers against Baekje's Doksan fortress but the Silla general Ju Jin led a relief army and the Goguryeo assault failed. In 550, Baekje invaded and sacked Dosal fortress. Goguryeo counterattacked and struck Baekje's Geumhyeon fortress, but Silla took advantage of this to seize two more Goguryeo castles. In 551, the emerging empire of the G√∂kt√ºrks invaded from Central Asia and laid siege to Sin fortress; unable to take it, they attacked Baegam fortress instead.

Its ships were usually named after trees. Its contribution to Irish neutrality was recognised by the government after the war. In the post-war years the company continued to operate as a commercial strategic reserve until 1984 when, as a result of taking on a series of expensive long-term time charters, it was forced into liquidation. Background Ireland had declared its neutrality when hostilities broke out and in the early years of the war much of its food needs were carried on board Allied vessels. The Irish government realised that they needed to be more independent and self- sufficient. In February 1941, Se√°n Lemass, the Minister for Supplies stated that The creation of an Irish mercantile marine was necessary, as it was as important for the national safety as the Army. On 21 March 1941, Irish Shipping Limited was formed as a company majority owned by the state, which held 51% of the shares. 43¬æ% were owned by Grain Importers Ireland Ltd and the three largest shipping companies in the state, Wexford Steamship Company, Limerick Steamship Company and Palgrave Murphy Limited, held 1¬æ% each. Each of the shareholders also had a representative on the board. Unfortunately the new company had a major problem in that it had no ships and needed to acquire some. Lemass's ministerial secretary John Leydon became the first chairman of Irish Shipping. The wartime fleet Ships of all forms and in all conditions were a very scarce resource during the early years of the war. The company management took control of whatever tonnage, in whatever condition, they could lay their hands on. Its first ship was the which was located in Avil√©s, Spain as the Greek-flagged Vassilios Destounis. It had been abandoned following an attack by a German aircraft in the Bay of Biscay and towed into port by Spanish fishermen, where it was purchased by Irish Shipping. =List of ships operated during World War Two= Acquired in 1941 * (March 1941 ‚Äì 1949) Ex Vassilios Destounis * (28 July 1941 ‚Äì November 1949) Ex Hiafa Trader * (13 May 1941 ‚Äì 1948) Ex Cetvrti * (August 1941 ‚Äì 1949) Ex Leda * (14 October 1941 ‚Äì 1949) Ex Margara * (17 June 1941 ‚Äì 1943, 1945 ‚Äì 1949) Ex Noemijulia * (21 May 1941 ‚Äì 15 May 1943) Ex West Neris * (21 May 1941 ‚Äì 16 November 1942) Ex West Hematite * (26 December 1941 ‚Äì 1 February 1947) Ex Arena * (December 1941 ‚Äì 1946) Ex Otto Acquired in 1942 * 1942 to 1946 * 1942 to 1946 * 1942 to 1949 * 1942 to 1949 Acquired in 1943 * =Other ventures= The nature of the conflict and of the state meant that Irish Shipping had some unusual influences on its commercial operations. This led it into a number of other commercial ventures, most notably marine insurance and ship repair, where it might not necessarily have wanted to be. A combination of the war, and that Irish vessels were sailing out of convoy, led to impossibly high premiums for goods carried in Irish ships. This encouraged the company to set up its own successful marine insurance business which it sold to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland after the war.

Both of these vessels were equipped with refrigerated cargo tweendecks for the carriage of meat. The Irish Spruce ran aground in the Caribbean in 1972 and was subsequently broken up for scrap. The tankers The 1958‚Äì1965, 1959‚Äì1965 and 1954‚Äì1967 were the only tankers ever operated by ISL. Both the Irish Hawthorn and Irish Blackthorn were sold in 1965. The Irish Blackthorn and Irish Hawthorn were steam turbine vessels. The Irish Holly was primarily a coastal oil tanker, triple expansion steam engine. This vessel survived in the fleet for some time after the two larger vessels. =Ships acquired in the 1960s= Two steam turbine ships were owned and operated: * , 1957‚Äì1972 * , 1956‚Äì1972 Due to the sharp increase in the price of oil and the greater thermal efficiencies of diesel engines, these were the last two steam powered ships to be operated by Irish Shipping. Note:-Both of these vessels were acquired in the 1950s, not the 1960s the Poplar in 1956 and the Spruce in 1957, built to order for Irish Shipping, and had refrigerated cargo spaces for the carriage of frozen meat. They both survived to the early 1970s. Two sisters delivered in the early 1960s. Laid down in the very late 1950s. Irish Rowan. First vessel built in the newly formed Verolme Cork Dockyard. 1961. Powered by Doxford diesel engine. Irish Sycamore a sister of the Rowan with similar machinery, built in England. Two other sister ships were operated: * 1963‚Äì1976 IHP 8,450 ON 400358 (c. 1963) * 1962‚Äì1976 BHP 7,250 ON 400269 (c. 1963) The Irish Cedar operated the Cork-Casablanca-Dublin run importing phophate for Gouldings Ireland before the Irish Plane was used on the run. When the Irish Cedar was sold in the 1970s she was converted to an oil exploration vessel, a drill ship. The Irish Plane operated on the Casablanca ‚Äì Dublin ‚Äì Cork run, importing phosphate fertiliser for several years. Both of these sisters were powered by MAN diesel engines, type KZ70-120D =Ships acquired in the 1970s= The Star ships and the Elm Irish Shipping entered a joint venture with the Norwegian Star shipping company and operated two ships; * 1970 -1978 * 1970‚Äì1976 A bulk carrier with retractable/stackable car decks was also acquired; * 1968‚Äì1979 ON 400577 BHP 18,800. ON 400577 The Irish Elm was the second vessel built for Irish Shipping at Verolme Cork Dockyard and made her maiden voyage in 1969. The vessel was a new departure for the company being operated by a GPR (general purpose) crew. Each crew member had a cabin and the vessel had an officers and a crew bar. It also had a swimming pool. The accommodation, all aft was air conditioned. The Main Engine, a MAN, could be manoeuvred from the bridge. She was designed to run with an unmanned machinery space, UMS, for night time sailing in open waters, however this was seldom, if ever achieved. There were many design problems with the UMS equipment, the main problem being that the electronics were germanium based rather than silicon. Silicon had not come to the fore as the most suitable semiconductor material. The germanium was affected by the high ambient temperatures in the engine room. The vessel was primarily designed as a bulk carrier but had electro-hydraulic cranes and pontoon decks fitted after her sea trials. She operated for many years as a car carrier primarily transporting cars from Japan to USA and Europe. The Elm was sold in 1979. A further mis-match of technology was the use of steam driven reciprocating feed pump for the exhaust gas boiler. Controlled by a pneumatic valve, the system required constant attention to ensure correct operation. Celtic Bulk Carriers In the early 1970s ISL set up a joint venture with Reardon Smiths called Celtic Bulk Carriers and between them ordered 12 standard ships from Govan Shipbuilders in Glasgow. The ships were referred to as \\"Clyde\\"-class and the Irish ships were named: * 1973‚Äì * 1973‚Äì * 1973‚Äì Reg T 11360.88 ON 401220 * 1973‚Äì , ON 401218 BHP 11600 The Japanese Ships The and were built in Japan and delivered in 1976. =The Spruce= The company took delivery of their final vessel, the in 1983. Built in Verolme Cork Dockyards, it was a Panamax bulk carrier of . Its ordering and build were the subject of much controversy with many feeling that the Irish government put undue pressure on the company to place the order to keep the dockyard open. Managed Vessels =The Rock Boats=   =Other Managed Vessels= *Lough Beltra *Asgard II Liquidation and aftermath 0n 14 November 1984, the Irish government surprised most observers by placing Irish Shipping Ltd into liquidation. Maurice Tempany, a senior partner at Ernst & Young was appointed as Official Liquidator. He quickly set about laying-off the staff and making preparations for the sale of the ships. With four ships still owned by the company ‚Äì Irish Maple, Irish Rowan, Irish Cedar and Irish Spruce ‚Äì as each came into port it was arrested and eventually sold.

Schroeder challenged the state of freedom of speech in the United States, claiming that the US government may be a tyranny and that the way Americans view their liberties makes Americans hypocrites. Schroeder was a freelance psychoanalyst who studied the sexual basis of all religious experience. His interest in free speech, as well as his psychosexual theories, led him to study the controversial life of 19th-century free speech and women's rights advocate Ida C. Craddock. Career Schroeder entered the University of Wisconsin in 1882 to study engineering, then earned a law degree in 1889. Schroeder practiced law for ten years in Salt Lake City, Utah, working for statehood for Utah. In 1900, Schroeder moved to New York. In 1902, he formed the Free Speech League (a precursor to the American Civil Liberties Union) with Lincoln Steffens and others. Schroeder helped defend his anarchist friend Emma Goldman at her Denver trial. In 1904 Schroeder retired from practicing law and began writing. In his later years, he lived in Greenwich, Connecticut. At the time of Schroeder's death, his friend Lesley Kuhn was preparing for publication another book consisting of reprints of articles written by Schroeder, mainly anti-Mormon in nature. The headings of the articles were \\"Incest in Mormonism,\\" \\"Polygamy in Congress,\\" \\"Polygamy and the Constitution,\\" \\"Polygamy and Inspired Lies,\\" \\"The Sex-Determinant in Mormon Theology,\\" \\"Mormonism and Prostitution,\\" \\"Proxies in Mormon Polygamy,\\" \\"Was Joseph Smith, 'The Prophet,' an Abortionist?\\" \\"Sadism in Mormonism,\\" and \\"Sanctified Lust.\\" His writings became the subject of a lawsuit following his death. In his will, Schroeder left his estate to two friends, with the instruction that the money from the estate be used to gather his voluminous writings and publish them. Two of Schroeder's cousins contested the will and successfully voided it. When upholding a lower court's decision, Judge O'Sullivan of the Connecticut Supreme Court stated in a unanimous three-judge opinion; > The law will not declare a trust valid when the object of the trust, as the > finding discloses, is to distribute articles which reek of the sewer. The > very enumeration of some of the titles which Schroeder selected for his > writings brands them indelibly, and a reading of the article which he called > \\"Prenatal Psychisms and Mystical Pantheism\\" is a truly nauseating experience > in the field of pornography.

It was successful and popular upon releaseKid Brother review and today is considered by critics and fans to be one of Lloyd's best films, integrating elements of comedy, romance, drama, and character development. Its storyline is an homage to a 1921 film called Tol'able David, although it is essentially a re-make of a little-known 1924 Hal Roach feature, The White Sheep, starring Glenn Tryon.  Plot  The Hickorys are a respected family in Hickoryville. Sheriff Jim and his big, strong sons Leo and Olin have little respect for the youngest son, Harold, who does not have their muscles. When Jim, Leo and Olin go to an important town meeting to discuss a dam, Harold is left behind. He puts on his father's gun and badge and is mistaken for the sheriff by \\"Flash\\" Farrell, who runs a traveling medicine show for Mary after the death of her father. Farrell talks Harold into signing a permit to let him, strongman Sandoni and dancer Mary perform. Later, Mary tries to avoid the unwanted attentions of Sandoni and encounters Harold. They are attracted to each other. Harold and Mary When Jim finds out that Harold authorized the medicine show, he orders his son to shut down the performance. Harold tries, but Farrell makes a fool of him, then has him tied up. Harold's sworn enemy, Hank Hooper, pelts him and accidentally starts a fire that consumes the medicine show wagon. Harold invites Mary to spend the night in the family home. Jim is asleep, so Harold cannot get his permission; Harold has to use his wits to overcome the opposition of his brothers. However, Mrs. Hooper and her son Hank show up and take Mary with them, as it would not be decent for Mary to spend the night in a house without \\"womenfolk\\". The next day is a town celebration, where Jim is supposed to turn over to a state official the funds raised by the residents to help build the dam. However, the money is gone. Jim strongly suspects Farrell and Sandoni of being responsible, but Sam Hooper accuses him of the theft and refuses to let him go after them. Jim sends Leo and Olin, but not Harold, after them. When they return empty-handed, Jim allows himself to be tied up. There is talk of lynching. Harold confesses to Mary that he is not the person he pretended to be, but she tells him she has faith in him. Then Hank accuses her of being in on the robbery. Harold fights back when some men grab her, only to have Hank knock him out and set him adrift in a rowboat. He awakens after the boat reaches an abandoned, beached ship. Aboard he finds the real thieves. Sandoni disposes of Farrell after they argue over the division of the loot. Then the strongman spots Harold and chases him all over the ship. Eventually, Harold subdues Sandoni and races back to town with his prisoner and the money to save his father. An impressed Jim tells him, \\"Son, you're a real Hickory.\\" As Harold and Mary walk away, they encounter Hank. Harold musters the courage to fight his longtime nemesis and beats him up. Cast *Harold Lloyd as Harold Hickory *Jobyna Ralston as Mary Powers *Walter James as Jim Hickory *Leo Willis as Leo Hickory *Olin Francis as Olin Hickory * Constantine Romanoff as Sandoni *Eddie Boland as \\"Flash\\" Farrell *Frank Lanning as Sam Hooper *Ralph Yearsley as Hank Hooper Production Lobby card This was the last of Lloyd's features to star Jobyna Ralston, who starred as leading lady in five of his previous films. She would go on to play a supporting part in Wings. Lloyd wanted the film to have more gags than any of his previous features, so around eight writers and gagmen worked on the script. Many of these bits were cut from the finished film, and some were incorporated into Lloyd's subsequent films. The rural setting was a contrast to most of Lloyd's urban films of the mid to late 1920s. It was filmed in then-rural Glendale, Burbank, and Altadena (near current-day Pasadena), and the derelict ship scenes were filmed at Catalina Island. Lewis Milestone directed a majority of the film, in an uncredited capacity. He left the production due to contract problems with another studio. Home media A restored version of The Kid Brother with a new score by Carl Davis was prepared by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill in the early 1990s.

It has platforms on both lines, until 2018 only the Redditch line platforms saw regular services, however since Cross-City Line services were extended to Bromsgrove, the main line platforms now also see regular use.

The B&GR; was linked to the Bristol and Gloucester Railway in 1845 to create a through route to the West Country and then became part of the Midland Railway's expanding network in 1846. The station then became a junction in 1859 with the opening of the Midland's branch line to . This was subsequently extended through to Evesham and in stages between 1866 and 1868. The Midland then opened a second route into Birmingham New Street (the Birmingham West Suburban Railway) in 1885 to provide an alternative to the original B&G; line via Camp Hill, which was becoming increasingly congested at its eastern end (which it shared with the LNWR main line from Euston and the Midland's own route from ). Though the station was used as an interchange between the two lines from the outset, its main line platforms were initially staggered - the northbound platform being located north of the junction and initially connected to the two southbound ones by a foot crossing (which was replaced by a footbridge in 1895). A second platform on the branch was provided in 1894, when the first 350 yards from the junction were doubled. A more comprehensive rebuilding scheme came in 1928, when the Cofton Tunnel was demolished and replaced by a wide cutting, so that the main line towards Northfield and Kings Norton could be quadrupled by the LMS (who had taken over ownership of the station at the 1923 Grouping). This saw the Birmingham-bound platform relocated south of the junction to create the layout still in use today. The Evesham loop line through Redditch and Evesham was used in Midland and LMS days as a relief route for freight traffic to avoid the steeply-graded Lickey Incline in addition to carrying local passenger traffic, but under British Rail auspices it was closed to passengers south of Redditch in October 1962 due to the poor condition of the track (formal closure occurring on 17 June 1963) and completely in July 1964. The remaining part of the branch north of Redditch had seen its service dieselised and improved to hourly in April 1960, only for it to be listed for closure in the Beeching Report of 1963 along with Barnt Green station itself. As a precursor to this, the timetable was drastically cut back in May 1964, with only a handful of (mostly) peak period services being retained. However the route was eventually reprieved in August 1965 after protests from local rail users and the area's four MPs. Stopping trains on the main line southwards toward and were withdrawn in April 1966 (though the station at survived), leaving the by now unstaffed station to be served by the few surviving Redditch to Birmingham trains for the next 14 years (the BR timetable of 1972 lists just four trains in each direction serving all of the surviving local stations on the route - two return trips in the morning peak, one at midday, one in the evening and no Sunday service). The service level was eventually boosted in May 1980, when hourly trains were reintroduced between and Redditch as an extension of the recently commissioned Birmingham Cross-City Line from . This frequency was increased to half-hourly in 1989 and in 1992 the route was electrified (though only the centre main lines were wired beyond Longbridge - the outer lines remain diesel-only and are designated as goods loops). A limited service has also returned to the mainline platforms in recent years, provided by trains on the New St - Worcester - Hereford line (see below). Services Southbound Cross-City line services towards Redditch depart from Platform 4, at 20-minute intervals during the daytime but dropping to every half-hour after 20:00 (Monday-Friday, first train departs at 06:30; last train departs at 23:40). Services to down the Lickey incline began on 29 July 2018, with a 20-minute service in operation from platform 2. Northbound Cross-City line services towards Birmingham New Street and depart alternately from Platform 3 and platform 1, at 10-minute intervals through the day/15 mins after 20:00 (Monday-Friday, first train departs at 06:23; last train departs at 23:08). These trains originate alternately at Redditch and Bromsgrove since the start of operations from the latter on 29 July 2018. On Sundays there are 3tph to Birmingham New Street (2 from Redditch and 1 from Bromsgrove) with 2tph continuing to Lichfield Trent Valley. The station is also served by a limited service on the Birmingham-Worcester Line (Monday-Friday only) to/from Worcester, Great Malvern and Hereford. Barnt Green Station, with an Up freight in 1963 Facilities The station has no permanent buildings (the building located behind shrubs adjacent to Platforms 2 and 3 is a private business, in no way affiliated with the station). It has automatic ticket machines located on platforms 3 and 4, and shelters are provided on Platforms 2, 3 and 4. A footbridge connects all four platforms, although there is no access for wheelchairs. There is step-free access to Platforms 1 and 4. The station has a small (charged) car park adjacent to Platform 4 provided jointly by Bromsgrove District Council/West Midlands Trains. The station along with all those located on the Cross-City line has departure boards showing real time train information, located on Platforms 3 and 4.

The park is located within the Cairngorms National Park. The park is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). History The Highland Wildlife Park was opened in 1972 and has been run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (which also operates the Edinburgh Zoo) since 1986. With the exception of Christmas Day, the park is open every day of the year, weather permitting. In 1980 the park was made famous by obtaining \\"Felicity the Puma\\", a puma that was reputedly captured nearby by a farmer. The puma lived out her days in the park and is now on show stuffed in the Inverness Museum. In the past the park has also been the home to several examples of the famous \\"Kellas cat\\". The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, owner and administrator of the Highland Wildlife Park, altered the theme of the park in 2007 from native species of the Highlands, to species from tundra and mountainous habitats around the world. This move is an attempt to bring the park closer to the working practices of the RZSS's main site, Edinburgh Zoo as well as to increase visitor numbers which had been virtually static for some years. Although the park was in need of serious investment for some years, many locals to the area as well as frequent visitors believe that this move would distance the park from its hitherto unique attraction as a place to see native species in their natural habitat, and will eventually turn the park into another safari park filled with ever more exotic animals in an attempt to attract more of the area's visitors. In response to this view, the RZSS claims that the new animals in the park's collection are for the most part extremely endangered, and their presence at the park will help safeguard their future, as well as demonstrating the Highlands' place in the global ecosystem. However, critics said that many of the animals which were lost in the first wave of alterations (badgers, red foxes, Soay sheep, Highland cattle, polecat) may not have been endangered in the Highlands, but were the kinds of animals that visitors associate with the Highlands and would be extremely lucky to have seen in person during their stay. The first animals to arrive were two bharals in February 2007, closely followed by markhor and yak at Easter. Kiang followed and the first Japanese macaques came at the end of June 2007. In 2008, Bactrian wapiti, Chinese grey goral, Mishmi takin, red panda, Himalayan tahr, Carpathian lynx, Afghan urial, European elk arrived, some coming from Edinburgh Zoo. 2008 also saw the arrival of a purpose-built aviary for Himalayan snowcock. The park also had several Mishmi takin, kiang, markhor, and urial births. The new Amur tiger enclosure has opened at the park, costing ¬£400,000. It is now home to a pair of tigers, Sasha and Yuri a proven breeding pair from Edinburgh zoo. On 11 May, three cubs were born and are now taking their first steps into the main enclosure under the watchful eye of mum Sasha. Births in 2009 also include first breedings at the park for European elk and Himalayan tahr. A new exhibit for a pair of European wolves opened in 2011 as well as a new exhibit for Pallas cats. A bachelor herd of vicuna arrived from Edinburgh Zoo. European cranes also arrived. The Pallas cats have bred, raising 3 kittens. There are new aviaries for snowy and great grey owls. Two female musk ox have arrived at the park from the Netherlands, they are a mother/daughter pair and are the first musk ox imported into the UK in over 20 years. Five female white-lipped deer have arrived at the park from the Edinburgh Zoo, these are the only females of their species in the UK. A new enclosure for European forest reindeer has been built next to the European wolves. A new male polar bear and male Amur tiger arrived at the park. Five European wolves a Japanese serow and two northern lynx were born in 2012 a male musk ox arrived from Sweden, two red pandas also joined the collection. A new Chinese grey goral enclosure has been constructed; their former enclosure is being developed for wolverine. Wolverine have arrived and recent births (June 2013) include the park's first great grey owl, white-lipped deer, red panda and musk oxen along with Turkmenian markhor, European lynx, Amur tiger, Bactrian wapiti, and Mishmi takin. In 2014, a female European bison was returned for reintroduction to Romania, amongst the births at the park were 6 Pallas cat kittens, two female mishmi takinhttp://www.zoochat.com/38/hwp-2014-a-358723/ and a first hatching of satyr tragopan for the park. Summer 2014 saw the start of construction of a new enclosure for a sourced female polar bear that will be arriving at the park in spring 2015. It was confirmed in October 2014 that snow leopard and Amur leopard would arrive at the park in 2015. The last bharal and Japanese serow left the collection in 2014. 2015 saw the arrival of a female polar bear from Aalborg Zoo in Denmark, kept in a specially-built enclosure behind the musk oxen, where there is a sub enclosure for a male that has been introduced to her. In 2018 a resulting polar bear cub was born at the wildlife park. The park's first snow leopards have arrived from Marwell and Krefeld zoos and have been released into a cliff face enclosure, next to the markhor. April 2016 saw the first birth at the park and in Scotland of twin wolverine kits. 2016 also saw the last of the eastern kiang herd transferred to Knowsley safari park. A male European forest reindeer was born in June and the park has welcomed its first Amur leopard, housed in an offshow breeding unit, located at the rear of the park. The offshow pair of Amur leopards produced a pair of twins in summer 2018. The first polar bear to be born in the UK for 25 years arrived at the end of 2017 It was the week before Christmas when we first heard cub noises from inside the cubbing den, confirming our female polar bear Victoria had given birth, a male to be called Hamish The park also had their first European crane and snow leopards born in 2019. Attractions Visitors experience Scottish wildlife past and present in the setting of the Scottish Highlands. On show are a variety of animals found in present-day Scotland, animals that were once present, hundreds, even thousands of years ago, and mountainous regions all over the globe.

The first-generation settlers were members of the Marxist Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair.

The first quantum error-correcting codes are strikingly similar to classical block codes in their operation and performance. Quantum error- correcting codes restore a noisy, decohered quantum state to a pure quantum state. A stabilizer quantum error-correcting code appends ancilla qubits to qubits that we want to protect. A unitary encoding circuit rotates the global state into a subspace of a larger Hilbert space. This highly entangled, encoded state corrects for local noisy errors. A quantum error-correcting code makes quantum computation and quantum communication practical by providing a way for a sender and receiver to simulate a noiseless qubit channel given a noisy qubit channel whose noise conforms to a particular error model. The stabilizer theory of quantum error correction allows one to import some classical binary or quaternary codes for use as a quantum code. However, when importing the classical code, it must satisfy the dual-containing (or self- orthogonality) constraint. Researchers have found many examples of classical codes satisfying this constraint, but most classical codes do not. Nevertheless, it is still useful to import classical codes in this way (though, see how the entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism overcomes this difficulty).  Mathematical background  The Stabilizer formalism exploits elements of the Pauli group \\\\Pi in formulating quantum error-correcting codes. The set \\\\Pi=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ I,X,Y,Z\\\\right\\\\\\\\} consists of the Pauli operators: : I\\\\equiv \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} ,\\\\ X\\\\equiv \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} ,\\\\ Y\\\\equiv \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i\\\\\\\\\\\\ i & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} ,\\\\ Z\\\\equiv \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} . The above operators act on a single qubit-a state represented by a vector in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Operators in \\\\Pi have eigenvalues \\\\pm1 and either commute or anti-commute. The set \\\\Pi^{n} consists of n-fold tensor products of Pauli operators: : \\\\Pi^{n}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array} [c]{c} e^{i\\\\phi}A_{1}\\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes A_{n}:\\\\forall j\\\\in\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 1,\\\\ldots ,n\\\\right\\\\\\\\} A_{j}\\\\in\\\\Pi,\\\\ \\\\ \\\\phi\\\\in\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 0,\\\\pi/2,\\\\pi,3\\\\pi/2\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{array} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Elements of \\\\Pi^{n} act on a quantum register of n qubits. We occasionally omit tensor product symbols in what follows so that :A_{1}\\\\cdots A_{n}\\\\equiv A_{1}\\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes A_{n}. The n-fold Pauli group \\\\Pi^{n} plays an important role for both the encoding circuit and the error-correction procedure of a quantum stabilizer code over n qubits.  Definition  Let us define an \\\\left[ n,k\\\\right] stabilizer quantum error-correcting code to encode k logical qubits into n physical qubits. The rate of such a code is k/n. Its stabilizer \\\\mathcal{S} is an abelian subgroup of the n-fold Pauli group \\\\Pi^{n}. \\\\mathcal{S} does not contain the operator -I^{\\\\otimes n}. The simultaneous +1-eigenspace of the operators constitutes the codespace. The codespace has dimension 2^{k} so that we can encode k qubits into it. The stabilizer \\\\mathcal{S} has a minimal representation in terms of n-k independent generators :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ g_{1},\\\\ldots,g_{n-k}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\forall i\\\\in\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ 1,\\\\ldots,n-k\\\\right\\\\\\\\} ,\\\\ g_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . The generators are independent in the sense that none of them is a product of any other two (up to a global phase). The operators g_{1},\\\\ldots,g_{n-k} function in the same way as a parity check matrix does for a classical linear block code.  Stabilizer error-correction conditions  One of the fundamental notions in quantum error correction theory is that it suffices to correct a discrete error set with support in the Pauli group \\\\Pi^{n}. Suppose that the errors affecting an encoded quantum state are a subset \\\\mathcal{E} of the Pauli group \\\\Pi^{n}: :\\\\mathcal{E}\\\\subset\\\\Pi^{n}. Because \\\\mathcal{E} and \\\\mathcal{S} are both subsets of \\\\Pi^{n}, an error E\\\\in\\\\mathcal{E} that affects an encoded quantum state either commutes or anticommutes with any particular element g in \\\\mathcal{S}. The error E is correctable if it anticommutes with an element g in \\\\mathcal{S}. An anticommuting error E is detectable by measuring each element g in \\\\mathcal{S} and computing a syndrome \\\\mathbf{r} identifying E. The syndrome is a binary vector \\\\mathbf{r} with length n-k whose elements identify whether the error E commutes or anticommutes with each g\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}. An error E that commutes with every element g in \\\\mathcal{S} is correctable if and only if it is in \\\\mathcal{S}. It corrupts the encoded state if it commutes with every element of \\\\mathcal{S} but does not lie in \\\\mathcal{S} . So we compactly summarize the stabilizer error-correcting conditions: a stabilizer code can correct any errors E_{1},E_{2} in \\\\mathcal{E} if :E_{1}^{\\\\dagger}E_{2} otin\\\\mathcal{Z}\\\\left( \\\\mathcal{S}\\\\right) or :E_{1}^{\\\\dagger}E_{2}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S} where \\\\mathcal{Z}\\\\left( \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\right) is the centralizer of \\\\mathcal{S} (i.e., the subgroup of elements that commute with all members of \\\\mathcal{S}, also known as the commutant).  Relation between Pauli group and binary vectors  A simple but useful mapping exists between elements of \\\\Pi and the binary vector space \\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2}. This mapping gives a simplification of quantum error correction theory. It represents quantum codes with binary vectors and binary operations rather than with Pauli operators and matrix operations respectively. We first give the mapping for the one-qubit case. Suppose \\\\left[ A\\\\right] is a set of equivalence classes of an operator A that have the same phase: : \\\\left[ A\\\\right] =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\beta A\\\\ \\\\ \\\\beta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C},\\\\ \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta\\\\right\\\\vert =1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Let \\\\left[ \\\\Pi\\\\right] be the set of phase- free Pauli operators where \\\\left[ \\\\Pi\\\\right] =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left[ A\\\\right] \\\\ \\\\ A\\\\in\\\\Pi\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Define the map N:\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2}\\\\rightarrow\\\\Pi as : 00 \\\\to I, \\\\,\\\\, 01 \\\\to X, \\\\,\\\\, 11 \\\\to Y, \\\\,\\\\, 10 \\\\to Z Suppose u,v\\\\in\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2}. Let us employ the shorthand u=\\\\left( zx\\\\right) and v=\\\\left( z^{\\\\prime}x^{\\\\prime }\\\\right) where z, x, z^{\\\\prime}, x^{\\\\prime}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}. For example, suppose u=\\\\left( 01\\\\right) . Then N\\\\left( u\\\\right) =X. The map N induces an isomorphism \\\\left[ N\\\\right] :\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z} _{2}\\\\right) ^{2}\\\\rightarrow\\\\left[ \\\\Pi\\\\right] because addition of vectors in \\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2} is equivalent to multiplication of Pauli operators up to a global phase: : \\\\left[ N\\\\left( u+v\\\\right) \\\\right] =\\\\left[ N\\\\left( u\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\left[ N\\\\left( v\\\\right) \\\\right] . Let \\\\odot denote the symplectic product between two elements u,v\\\\in\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2}: : u\\\\odot v\\\\equiv zx^{\\\\prime}-xz^{\\\\prime}. The symplectic product \\\\odot gives the commutation relations of elements of \\\\Pi: : N\\\\left( u\\\\right) N\\\\left( v\\\\right) =\\\\left( -1\\\\right) ^{\\\\left( u\\\\odot v\\\\right) }N\\\\left( v\\\\right) N\\\\left( u\\\\right) . The symplectic product and the mapping N thus give a useful way to phrase Pauli relations in terms of binary algebra. The extension of the above definitions and mapping N to multiple qubits is straightforward. Let \\\\mathbf{A}=A_{1}\\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes A_{n} denote an arbitrary element of \\\\Pi^{n}. We can similarly define the phase-free n-qubit Pauli group \\\\left[ \\\\Pi^{n}\\\\right] =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right] \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\in\\\\Pi^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where : \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right] =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\beta\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\beta\\\\in \\\\mathbb{C},\\\\ \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta\\\\right\\\\vert =1\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . The group operation \\\\ast for the above equivalence class is as follows: : \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right] \\\\ast\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right] \\\\equiv\\\\left[ A_{1}\\\\right] \\\\ast\\\\left[ B_{1}\\\\right] \\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes\\\\left[ A_{n}\\\\right] \\\\ast\\\\left[ B_{n}\\\\right] =\\\\left[ A_{1}B_{1}\\\\right] \\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes\\\\left[ A_{n}B_{n}\\\\right] =\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{AB}\\\\right] . The equivalence class \\\\left[ \\\\Pi^{n}\\\\right] forms a commutative group under operation \\\\ast. Consider the 2n-dimensional vector space : \\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2n}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{z,x}\\\\right) :\\\\mathbf{z},\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . It forms the commutative group (\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2n},+) with operation + defined as binary vector addition. We employ the notation \\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{z}\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right) ,\\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{z}^{\\\\prime}\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right) to represent any vectors \\\\mathbf{u,v}\\\\in\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2n} respectively. Each vector \\\\mathbf{z} and \\\\mathbf{x} has elements \\\\left( z_{1},\\\\ldots ,z_{n}\\\\right) and \\\\left( x_{1},\\\\ldots,x_{n}\\\\right) respectively with similar representations for \\\\mathbf{z}^{\\\\prime} and \\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\prime}. The symplectic product \\\\odot of \\\\mathbf{u} and \\\\mathbf{v} is : \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\odot\\\\mathbf{v\\\\equiv}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}z_{i}x_{i}^{\\\\prime}-x_{i} z_{i}^{\\\\prime}, or : \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\odot\\\\mathbf{v\\\\equiv}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}u_{i}\\\\odot v_{i}, where u_{i}=\\\\left( z_{i}x_{i}\\\\right) and v_{i}=\\\\left( z_{i}^{\\\\prime }x_{i}^{\\\\prime}\\\\right) . Let us define a map \\\\mathbf{N}:\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2n}\\\\rightarrow\\\\Pi^{n} as follows: : \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right) \\\\equiv N\\\\left( u_{1}\\\\right) \\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes N\\\\left( u_{n}\\\\right) . Let : \\\\mathbf{X}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right) \\\\equiv X^{x_{1}}\\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes X^{x_{n}}, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathbf{Z}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{z}\\\\right) \\\\equiv Z^{z_{1}}\\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes Z^{z_{n}}, so that \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right) and \\\\mathbf{Z}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{z}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{X}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right) belong to the same equivalence class: : \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right) \\\\right] =\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{z}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{X}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right) \\\\right] . The map \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\right] :\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2n}\\\\rightarrow\\\\left[ \\\\Pi^{n}\\\\right] is an isomorphism for the same reason given as in the previous case: : \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{u+v}\\\\right) \\\\right] =\\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right) \\\\right] , where \\\\mathbf{u,v}\\\\in\\\\left( \\\\mathbb{Z}_{2}\\\\right) ^{2n}. The symplectic product captures the commutation relations of any operators \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right) and \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right) : : \\\\mathbf{N\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right) N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right) =\\\\left( -1\\\\right) ^{\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\odot\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right) }\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right) . The above binary representation and symplectic algebra are useful in making the relation between classical linear error correction and quantum error correction more explicit. By comparing quantum error correcting codes in this language to symplectic vector spaces, we can see the following. A symplectic subspace corresponds to a direct sum of Pauli algebras (i.e., encoded qubits), while an isotropic subspace corresponds to a set of stabilizers. Example of a stabilizer code An example of a stabilizer code is the five qubit \\\\left 5,1,3\\\\right stabilizer code. It encodes k=1 logical qubit into n=5 physical qubits and protects against an arbitrary single-qubit error. It has code distance d=3. Its stabilizer consists of n-k=4 Pauli operators: : \\\\begin{array} [c]{ccccccc} g_{1} & = & X & Z & Z & X & I\\\\\\\\\\\\ g_{2} & = & I & X & Z & Z & X\\\\\\\\\\\\ g_{3} & = & X & I & X & Z & Z\\\\\\\\\\\\ g_{4} & = & Z & X & I & X & Z \\\\end{array} The above operators commute. Therefore, the codespace is the simultaneous +1-eigenspace of the above operators. Suppose a single-qubit error occurs on the encoded quantum register. A single-qubit error is in the set \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ X_{i},Y_{i},Z_{i}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where A_{i} denotes a Pauli error on qubit i. It is straightforward to verify that any arbitrary single-qubit error has a unique syndrome. The receiver corrects any single-qubit error by identifying the syndrome and applying a corrective operation. References * D.

It is also present in North Africa. The species name is sometimes spelt C. levigata, but the original orthography is C. l√¶vigata. Description It is a large shrub or small tree growing to or rarely to tall, with a dense crown. The leaves are long and broad, with two to three shallow, forward-pointing lobes on each side of the leaf. The hermaphrodite flowers are produced in corymbs of six to twelve, each flower with five white or pale pink petals and two or sometimes three styles. The flowers are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dark red pome diameter, slightly broader than long, containing two or three nutlets. Crataegus laevigata (fruits) It is distinguished from the closely related common hawthorn, C. monogyna, in the leaves being only shallowly lobed, with forward- pointing lobes, and in the flowers having more than one style. Each style produces a seed, so its fruits also have more than one seed and these make them slightly oval, in contrast with the single-seeded and therefore round fruits of common hawthorn. The two species hybridise, giving rise to C. √ó media. Taxonomy In the past, midland hawthorn was widely but incorrectly known by the name C. oxyacantha, a name that has now been rejected as being of uncertain application. In 1753 Linnaeus introduced the name C. oxyacantha for the single species of which he was aware, but described it in such a way that the name became used for various species, including both the midland and the common hawthorn. In 1775 Jacquin formally separated the common hawthorn, naming it C. monogyna,Jacquin, N.J. 1775. Florae Austriacae sive Plantarum Selectarum in Austri√¶ archiducatu: sponte crescentium icones, ad vivum colorat√¶, et descriptionibus, ac synonymis illustrat√¶. and in 1946 Dandy showed that Linnaeus had actually observed a different plant, and this would be C. oxyacantha. However, by this time confusion over the true identity of C. oxyacantha was so great that Byatt proposedByatt, J. (1974). Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 69: 15‚Äì20. that the name should be formally rejected as ambiguous, and this proposal was accepted by the International Botanical Congress,Brummitt, R. K. (1986). Taxon 35: 556‚Äì563. although the name continues to be used informally. The midland hawthorn was described botanically as a separate species as long ago as 1798 by Poiret, whose name Mespilus laevigata referred to this hawthorn. Poiret's name is reflected in the revised formal botanical name of midland hawthorn: Crataegus laevigata (Poir.) DC. Cultivars 'Fran√ßois Rigaud' has yellow fruit.Phipps, J.B.; O‚ÄôKennon, R.J.; Lance, R.W. 2003. Hawthorns and medlars. Royal Horticultural Society, Cambridge, U.K. 'Paul's Scarlet' (double red flowers), 'Punicea' (pink and white) and 'Rosea Flore Pleno' (double pink flowers) have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. These cultivars are considered by taxonomists to be derived from hybrids between C. laevigata and C. monogyna, within the named hybrid species C. √ó media. Parasites The hawthorn button-top gall on midland hawthorn is caused by the dipteran gall-midge Dasineura crataegi. References *Flora Europaea: Crataegus *Bean, W. J. (1976).

Moon was around cars and racing from his youth. His father owned \\"Moon Cafe\\" and had a go-kart track he called \\"Moonza\\", a pun on Monza. He was involved in dry lakes hot-rodding in the late 1940s. He founded MOON Speed Equipment (c.1950) and worked to improve the quality and safety of speed and racing products his entire life. Moon was one of the founding members of Speed Equipment Manufacturers Association in 1963. Dean Moon was a hot rodder and innovator of speed parts. He built and raced cars from El Mirage Dry Lake and Bonneville Salt Flats to the drag strips and beyond, and established a company that became an icon in the hot rodding industry. Starting his business from modest beginnings in a garage behind his father's Moon Cafe in Norwalk, he grew it into an internationally recognized brand name. Early products were a multi- carb fuel block, spun aluminum wheel discs, aluminum gas tanks and a foot- shaped throttle pedal. Products carrying the Moon name, including the Moon disc wheel covers and Moon Tank auxiliary fuel containers, were very popular, and Moon Equipment's bright-yellow show cars and drag cars were used as prototypes for Hot Wheels toys. In 1960 Moon purchased the Potvin company from Chuck Potvin, a good friend and manufacturer of ignitions, camshafts and blower drives. In 1962, he moved the company to the Moon Equipment building in Santa Fe Springs, California, and continued producing Potvin products. The very first A.C. Shelby Cobra to reach the United States, delivered to Carroll Shelby, was fitted with a Ford V8 engine and transmission at Dean Moon's shop in Santa Fe Springs, in February 1962. This historic location at 10820 S. Norwalk Blvd. is where MOONEYES still resides today. Moon brought a level of showmanship to the sport of drag racing. His cars not only went fast but looked good with signature Mooneyes decals, yellow paint and chrome plating. His teams were well turned out in all white uniforms with the MOON Logo and cowboy hats. Revell made a plastic model kit of the Chevrolet-powered Dragmaster-chassied Mooneyes dragster, which they termed as a rolling testbed (driven by Gary Cagle to a win at the 1962 NHRA WinternationalsBurgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"More Tree tales, the Mazi model, and Stuff In My Office\\", written 21 December 2007, at NHRA.com (retrieved 19 September 2018)), then as exhibition car shows after it retired from racing.Hot Rod Magazine, September 1961.

He was a prolific striker in the lower leagues during the 1980s and early 1990s, notably for Torquay United. He began his career as a junior with Newcastle United, but on failing to make the grade joined Hartlepool United on a free transfer in November 1981. He scored 8 times in 31 games before leaving the Victoria Ground. However, he returned in December 1983, signing from Horden Colliery, and went on to play a further 80 league games, in which he scored 24 goals. In July 1986 he moved to Torquay United on a free transfer and was top scorer in his first season as Torquay struggled to remain in the league. The fact that they did survive was down to Dobson's goal in injury time against Crewe Alexandra in the final game of the season, injury time only awarded after Torquay defender Jim McNichol had been bitten by a police dog. Dobson's equaliser meant that Torquay stayed in Fourth Division on goal difference, with Lincoln City the first side to suffer automatic relegation to the Nationwide Conference. He left Plainmoor in August 1988, joining Doncaster Rovers for ¬£20,000. After scoring 10 goals in just 24 games for Doncaster, Scarborough stepped in and paid ¬£40,000 for his services. He scored 22 times in 61 games for Scarborough, but was out of favour at the beginning of the 1990‚Äì91 season, joining first Halifax Town on loan in October 1990, with a further loan spell at Hereford United the following month. In January 1991 he moved to Lincoln City for ¬£40,000, a move not taken too kindly by some Lincoln fans given that it was his goal that relegated them to the Conference. However, two goals on his debut soon put paid to any doubts they had and Dobson went on to score 3 more goals in 20 league appearances. In August 1992 he moved to Darlington, but played only 14 games (10 of which were as a substitute), scoring twice before joining Conference side Gateshead, initially on loan, in February 1993 and signing permanently for a fee of ¬£3,500. He won the Conference Golden Boot as top-scorer in the 1993‚Äì94 and 1994‚Äì95 seasons, but after starting the first three games of the following season lost his place and featured only as a substitute until leaving to join Bishop Auckland in November 1995, Gateshead making a profit on the sale. He later ended his football career with Spennymoor United. In May 2001, the Torquay Herald Express reported that Paul, now diagnosed as a diabetic, was living in Newton Aycliffe in County Durham and working as a welder.

The Arboretum is open daily except major holidays; advance tickets are required for all visitors including members. Last ticket time is at 3pm everyday. http://www.morrisarboretum.org/visit_hours.shtml It is located at 100 East Northwestern Avenue, Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. History The Arboretum was formerly the estate of John T. (1847-1915) and Lydia T. Morris (1849-1932), a brother and sister who purchased and landscaped much of the arboretum's current site beginning in 1887. John Morris was interested in growing plants from around the world, including those collected in China by E. H. Wilson around 1900, and many of today's specimens date to Morris' original plantings. The estate became a public arboretum in 1933, after Lydia Morris' death. Note: This includes Collection Metasequoia glyptostroboides (dawn redwoods) Today the arboretum contains more than 13,000 labelled plants of over 2,500 types, representing the temperate floras of North America, Asia, and Europe, with a primary focus on Asia. Significant collections include native azaleas, conifers, hollies, magnolia species, maples, roses, and witch hazels. The arboretum has identified 17 trees in its collection as outstanding specimens: Abies cephalonica, Abies holophylla, Acer buergerianum, Aesculus flava, Cedrus libani var. atlantica 'Glauca', Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Fagus engleriana, Fagus sylvatica f. pendula, Metasequoia glyptostroboides, Pinus bungeana, Platanus √ó acerifolia, Quercus alba, Quercus √ó benderi, Tsuga canadensis f. pendula, Ulmus glabra 'Horizontalis', Ulmus parvifolia, and Zelkova serrata. Features The arboretum is set within a fine, mature landscape, primarily designed in the English park style but with Japanese influences. It includes winding paths and streams, a swan pond, formal rose gardens, and large sweeps of azaleas, rhododendrons, and magnolias. Notable aspects of the arboretum are as follows: \\"Compton\\" (Lydia & John Thompson Morris mansion), (1887-88, demolished 1968), by Theophilus Parsons Chandler, Jr., architect.

At , it is the longest numbered highway of any class in Louisiana. It runs diagonally across the state, connecting the oil and gas fields near the island of Grand Isle with the northwest corner of the state, north of Shreveport. The part south of U.S. Highway 90 near Raceland is Corridor 44, a National Highway System High Priority Corridor. From Alexandria to Shreveport, the LA 1 corridor was used for Interstate 49. Between New Roads, Louisiana, and the interchange with Interstate 49 at Alexandria, Louisiana, LA 10 forms part of the Zachary Taylor Parkway. Route description The southern terminus of LA 1 () is at a dead end in Grand Isle on the south bank of Bayou Rigaud. It heads southwest and west through Grand Isle, turning northwest where it meets LA 3090 (the road to Port Fourchon). At Leeville the road crosses Bayou Lafourche on the Leeville Bridge and begins to parallel the bayou on its west bank, heading through towns such as Golden Meadow, Larose, Lockport, Raceland, Thibodaux, Napoleonville and Paincourtville. At Donaldsonville, where the bayou meets the Mississippi River, LA 1 turns northwest to parallel the river. (Southeast of Donaldsonville, LA 18 and LA 3089/LA 3127 parallel the Mississippi.) Bridge of LA Highway 1 over the Cane River in Natchitoches From Donaldsonville to Port Allen, across the Mississippi from Baton Rouge, LA 1 generally parallels the Mississippi River. It takes a relatively straight inland route, bypassing the curves of the river followed by LA 405 and LA 988. At Port Allen, it meets U.S. Highway 190 at the west end of the Huey P. Long Bridge, and turns west with US 190 to past Erwinville. There it turns back north, running along several back channels and oxbows of the Mississippi to New Roads (which is bypassed by LA 3131), and then heading west from New Roads to Morganza with LA 10 (still paralleling the Mississippi). From Morganza to Lettsworth, LA 1 heads northwest near the Mississippi; LA 15 begins in Lettsworth and continues north along the river while LA 1 continues generally northwest towards Alexandria. LA 1 heads inland through such towns as Simmesport, Moreauville, and Marksville to Alexandria, where it meets the Pineville Expressway (U.S. Highway 165/LA 28). LA 1 turns southwest along its frontage roads - Fulton Street and Casson Street - along with LA 28 Business and U.S. Highway 167 Business to its end at Interstate 49, and continues southwest on Mason Street and northwest on Bolton Avenue. LA 1 in Caddo Parish, after crossing into Louisiana From Alexandria to Shreveport, LA 1 generally parallels Interstate 49, including a bypass around Natchitoches. Louisiana Highway 1 Business runs through downtown Natchitoches before rejoining the original highway just northwest of the city limits. It passes through Shreveport on Youree Drive, Spring Street and Market Street, running concurrently with U.S. Highway 71 from Interstate 20 downtown to a split north of downtown. From Shreveport to the border with Texas, where LA 1 becomes State Highway 77, LA 1 passes through towns such as Oil City, Vivian and Rodessa. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, LA 1 was part of several shorter routes, including: State Route 620 from Grand Isle to Golden Meadow; Route 622 to Cut Off; Route 78 to Raceland; Route 29 to Donaldsonville; and Route 168 to Port Allen. After traveling concurrent with US 190 to a point west of Erwinville, LA 1 followed Route 93 to New Roads; Route 30 to the Marksville area; Route 5 to Alexandria; Route 20 to Shreveport; and Route 8 to the Texas state line. All were designated by various acts of the state legislature between 1921 and 1930. The routes were joined together under the single designation of LA 1 when the Louisiana Department of Highways renumbered the state highway system in 1955, creating a continuous route diagonally across the entire state. Future The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) is converting LA 1 from Golden Meadow to Port Fourchon into an elevated toll expressway called the Louisiana Highway 1 Bridge. These improvements are in order to facilitate in evacuations of Port Fourchon and Grand Isle in the event of a hurricane, as LA 1 in this area is vulnerable to flooding, regardless of strength of storm. When completed, the Gateway to the Gulf ExpresswayGateway to the Gulf Expressway at Google Maps, Retrieved June 21, 2017. will be a elevated toll road from Golden Meadow to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to mid-June 2012, tolls were collected using \\"open road tolling\\" technology; LA 1 was the first road or bridge in Louisiana to have tolls collected in this method. Travelers using the facilities were required to pre-pay either online, by phone, or at one of five kiosks north of the expressway, or use the \\"GeauxPass\\", an electronic toll collection transponder (or \\"toll tag\\") that collects tolls electronically. The GeauxPass is also compatible with the Crescent City Connection and all future Louisiana toll roads and the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, but not the ferries. Beginning in June 2012, a toll plaza was opened at the access ramp in Leeville. Vehicle drivers must now pay before accessing the expressway and the pre-pay kiosks have been removed from their respective sites. The toll plaza accepts cash or credit/debit cards. GeauxPass is still accepted. Funding for the project through taxes and grants was not available, leading to the requirement to pay for the construction via collecting tolls. By law, LA 1 toll revenues may only be utilized to repay construction loan debts for the expressway. The first portion of this project, a two-lane toll bridge over Bayou Lafourche, opened on July 8, 2009. Tolling of the new bridge began on August 3, 2009. The two-lane section from Leeville to Port Fourchon opened on December 9, 2011. Funding is being secured for the section between Leeville and Golden Meadow with the eventual widening of the entire corridor to four lanes.

The Zhdanov Doctrine (also called Zhdanovism or Zhdanovshchina; ) was a Soviet cultural doctrine developed by Central Committee secretary Andrei Zhdanov in 1946. It proposed that the world was divided into two camps: the \\"imperialistic\\", headed by the United States; and \\"democratic\\", headed by the Soviet Union.Green and Karolides (2005), 668. The main principle of the Zhdanov doctrine was often summarized by the phrase \\"The only conflict that is possible in Soviet culture is the conflict between good and best\\". Zhdanovism soon became a Soviet cultural policy, meaning that Soviet artists, writers and intelligentsia in general had to conform to the party line in their creative works. Under this policy, artists who failed to comply with the government's wishes risked persecution. The policy remained in effect until the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953.Taruskin (2010), 12. History The 1946 resolution of the Central Committee was directed against two literary magazines, Zvezda and ', which had published supposedly apolitical, \\"bourgeois\\", individualistic works of the satirist Mikhail Zoshchenko and the poet Anna Akhmatova. Parallel to Zhdanovism, \\"courts of honor\\" were introduced in the party apparatus. Taken from the Tsarist era, these courts were aimed at intensifying Russian patriotism through staged mock trials. The people indicted were not executed, but they paid with their careers. Leningrad party leader Alexis Kuznetsov explained in 1947 that these were designed to target educated individuals within the party. Due to doubts about servility to the West in the central apparatus, even the Central Committee and the MGB had courts. In the battle for spiritual and cultural \\"independence\\", Zhdanovism led to the purging of such characters as Solomon Mikhoels and the writers of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. In 1950, with the \\"Leningrad affair\\", Kuznetsov himself was purged along with Deputy Premier Nikolai Voznesensky. Stalin himself had influence over the turn to more Tsarist policies, reinstating the \\"table of ranks\\" and revising the Soviet anthem. These policies were rolled back by Khrushchev when he came to power. Earlier some critics and literary historians were denounced for suggesting that Russian classics had been influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Moli√®re, Lord Byron or Charles Dickens. Part of Zhdanovism was a campaign against \\"cosmopolitanism\\", which meant that foreign models were not to be unthinkingly emulated, and native Russian accomplishments were emphasized. A further decree on music was issued on 20 February 1948, \\"On Muradeli's Opera The Great Friendship\\" and marked the beginning of the so-called \\"anti-formalism campaign\\". (The term \\"formalism\\" referred to art for art's sake which did not serve a larger social purpose.) Nominally aimed at Vano Muradeli's opera The Great Friendship,For the text in English see Revolutionary Democracy website, accessed 25 April 2017. it signaled a sustained campaign of criticism and persecution against many of the Soviet Union's foremost composers, notably Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Aram Khachaturian and Dmitri Klebanov for allegedly writing \\"hermetic\\" music and misusing dissonance.Braudel (1993), 565. The decree was followed in April by a special congress of the Composers' Union, where many of those attacked were forced publicly to repent. The campaign was satirized in the Anti-Formalist Rayok by Shostakovich. The composers condemned were formally rehabilitated by a further decree issued on 28 May 1958. In Wroc≈Çaw, a congress met in mid-1948. Accompanying Soviet consolidation of power in Eastern Europe, Zhdanov's chosen man Fadejev, president of the Soviet writer's union, made a speech establishing the base for socialist realism outside of the Soviet Union. This targeted three main groups - Soviet-leaning Western intellectuals that Zhdanov hoped would be brought around to Zhdanovism instead of just preaching peace, sympathetic non- Communist artists and intellectuals in liberal democracies, and artists and intellectuals in Eastern Europe and Soviet-occupied Germany who were to be forced to accept the tenets of Zhdanovism and socialist realism. This led to ripples in the West that led to more sympathies and pacifism in the West and benefited the SED in later East Germany.

It featured various content, including music videos, JibJab animated shorts, IFILM picks, viral videos, original content, TV shows such as Arrested Development, and news shorts. It also hosted the semi-finalists for Film Your Issue.

MSN Soapbox was initially an invitation-only beta service under the family of MSN Video products, designed to be a major contributor to the MSN portal. The MSN Soapbox service was discontinued in August 2009.

In addition, while searching for videos, Bing Videos features the following: *Smart Preview that enables the user to preview a video by mousing over its thumbnail. It allows the user to instantly watch a short preview of the original video *Filtering that filters results by video duration *Sorting that sorts results by either relevance or date *View Selection that switches between the grid view and list view *Related People that suggests famous people who are related to the query *Bing Videos is also integrated into other Bing services, including Bing News. = Adult content = Bing Video's preview mode can potentially be used to preview pornographic videos. By simply turning off safe search, users can search for and view pornographic video by hovering the cursor over a thumbnail, since the video and audio, in some cases, are cached on Microsoft's server. Since the videos are playing within Bing instead of the site where they are hosted, the videos are not necessarily blocked by parental control filters. Monitoring programs designed to tell parents what sites their children have visited are likely to simply report \\"Bing.com\\" instead of the site that actually hosts the video. The same situation can be said about corporate filters, many of which have been fooled by this feature. Users do not need to leave Bing's site to view these videos. Microsoft responded in a blog post on June 4, 2009, with a short term work-around. By adding \\"&adlt;=strict\\" to the end of a query, no matter what the settings are for that session it will return results as if safe search were set to strict. The query would look like this: \`http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=adulttermgoeshere&adlt;=strict\` (case sensitive). On June 12, 2009, Microsoft announced two changes regarding Bing's Smart Motion Preview and SafeSearch features. All potentially explicit content will be coming from a separate single domain, explicit.bing.net. Additionally, Bing will also return source URL information in the query string for image and video contents. Both changes allow both home users and corporate users to filter content by domain regardless of what the SafeSearch settings might be.

Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Perls (4 April 1942 ‚Äì 22 July 1987)Perls, Nic, Brad Hill, Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound, Volume 1 by Frank W. Hoffmann, Howard Ferstler, p. 820 was an American audio engineer and the founder and owner of Yazoo Records and Blue Goose Records. Early life Perls grew up in a Jewish family in New York City. The family had achieved some wealth operating New York City's Perls Gallery. Perls was one of a handful of serious East Coast collectors of 78-rpm country blues recordings during the 1960s. As a young man, he made two trips through the Deep South, where he knocked on doors seeking to acquire old blues records. He also was a frequent patron of antique shops in the New York area, always searching for rare blues records. Belzona Records In 1967, Perls began re-recording the sides in his collection, using high-tech equipment in his home, and issuing 33-rpm record albums. These releases generally contained 14 blues tunes each and often included informative liner notes by another blues collector, Steve Calt. The business was initially called Belzona Records. As a recording engineer, Perls's most renowned talent was his ability to ride a phonograph needle along the grooves of an old record in a way that Perls liked to describe as like riding a bobsled through an obstacle course, moving left, right, up or down to avoid as many scratches and gouges as possible. These album releases were always derived directly from 78-rpm shellac originals. By collecting and re-releasing such forgotten blues recordings, Perls preserved many classic blues performances (and later, those in related musical forms like ragtime) that otherwise might have been lost to the ages. The following year, after the Belzona label had released 6 records, an injunction was issued on behalf of a longstanding Scottish record company called Beltona, on the grounds that the name \\"Belzona\\" was too similar and would confuse record distributors. Nick Perls then changed the label's name to Yazoo Records.Wirtz's American Music, https://www.wirz.de/music/yazoo.htm - accessed May 25, 2020 Yazoo Records Under the new name, Perls reissued all 6 of the Belzona recordings, with new labels and covers. He continued releasing the same type of 33-rpm recordings under the Yazoo name, conducting all operations out of his residence in the West Village in New York City. Perls is pictured (in blackface) on the cover of the Yazoo recording Mr. Charlie's Blues. Perls operated Yazoo Records as sole proprietor, occasionally hiring an assistant. The label stayed small and rarely caught much public attention beyond the hardcore blues devotees who eagerly awaited each new release. In the 1980's, Perls' health began deteriorating in the AIDS epidemic. The Yazoo brand was then acquired by Shanachie Records, which eventually re-released the Yazoo catalogue on CD's. Shanachie has continued to use the Yazoo name for this particular line of CD's, and has continued to release new Yazoo albums, initially with some contributions from Perls' collection of 78's. Blue Goose Records In 1970, Perls started Blue Goose Records as a side project, using that label to release music by a variety of live performers that he recorded himself, often in his West Village living room. He was also a finger-pick guitarist but would only play the guitar socially, and strictly in imitation of one or another 1930s blues master. Stylistically, his playing ethos was summed up when he stated that the phrase \\"too choppy\\" is a contradiction in terms. His one foray as a recording artist can be heard as a duet on the song \\"My Game Blues\\", on the first Blue Goose release, Fast & Funky, by bluesman Larry Johnson.. During the early 1970's, Perls initiated a talent agency called Yellow Bee Productions, to help some of the blues performers on Blue Goose to get performance bookings. For about a year during this same period, Perls also used Yellow Bee to operate a juice bar where his performers could appear. Juice bars were a short-lived fad where no alcohol was served, no liquor licensing was required, and patrons could either bring their own liquor or go without, which was particularly popular among the hard drugs subculture of the time. With the closing of the juice bar, Perls also lost interest in the talent agency. Blue Goose Records, boasting almost no well-known celebrity talent names, stayed an even smaller operation than Yazoo. One notable exception may have been Perls' three Blue Goose albums of R. Crumb & His Cheap Suit Serenaders, which were enormously entertaining recordings by the cartoonist (and collector of early jazz and blues records) Robert Crumb and several of his California friends. The last Blue Goose album, \\"Roy Smeck: Wizard of the Strings\\" was issued in 1980. Many of the Blue Goose releases were subsequently converted to compact disc format by a company in Japan whose name translates to Airmail Recordings. Some of these CD's are still available in the U.S. as collectors items. Perls rarely broke even, financially, on any of his business endeavors. He would state that the \\"pop\\" big time did not appeal to him. He remained doggedly independent to the end.  Personal life  According to John Ramsey, Nick's assistant in the mid-1970s, Perls was a verbose New Yorker who strived to be \\"outrageous\\", an adjective that he loved attributing to himself. For instance, for several years he made a habit of wearing different colored checkered socks, (such as green and yellow on one foot, red and white on the other), which he cited as evidence of insanity. Further, Perls encouraged business acquaintances to refer to him as a \\"faggot\\", for the pure shock value. As explanation of this awkward request, Perls would claim that the term \\"homo\\"-sexual did not literally apply to him. The objects of his affections, young, effeminate black men, were not the same as him, rather literally \\"hetero\\" from him. Perls saw himself as a politically conservative, business man. In contrast, his personal lifestyle was built around \\"cruising\\" New York's 7th Avenue and picking up such individuals, leading to numerous short, intense relationships. Perls greatly enjoyed being seen in public arm in arm with his latest find, emphasizing the shock value of their intimacy.

She had been sailing from Yarmouth under the flag of Rear-Admiral Thomas Totty in an effort to reach the fleet of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker in the Sound preparing for the upcoming attack on the Danish fleet, with approximately 650 people on board. As the ship passed the Norfolk coast, she was caught in heavy wind and stuck on the Hammond Knoll Rock off Happisburgh, where she was pinned for some hours in the afternoon before breaking free but immediately being grounded on a sandbank, where the effect of wind and waves tore down the masts and began to break up the ship. She remained in that position for all of the following day, but late in the evening drifted off the sandbank and sank in deep water.Ships of the Old Navy, Invincible. The admiral and 195 sailors escaped the wreck, either in one of the ship's boats or were picked up by a passing collier and fishing boat, but over 400 of their shipmates drowned in the disaster, most of them once the ship began to sink in deeper water. The compulsory court martial investigating the incident, held on in Sheerness, absolved the admiral and the captain (posthumously) of culpability in the disaster, posthumously blaming the harbour pilot and the ship's master, both of whom had been engaged to steer the ship through the reefs and shoals of the dangerous region, and should have known the location of Hammond Knoll, especially since it was daytime and in sight of land.Caledonian Mercury, 23 March 1801 The remains of many of her crew were located by chance in a mass grave in Happisburgh churchyard during the digging of a new drainage channel. A memorial stone was erected in 1998 to their memory by the Ship's Company of the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Invincible, and by the Happisburgh parochial church council.

It is spoken in the Khandesh region, wedged between the territory of Bhili and that of Marathi. It consists of Khandeshi proper, and the Dangri and Ahirani dialects. The words \\"Ahirani\\" and \\"Khandeshi\\" are sometimes used interchangeably: Ahirani as the caste-based name (after Ahirs), and Khandesh as the region-based name.  Etymology  Khandeshi is named after the Khandesh region. There are various theories about the origin of the word Khandesh. One theory states that the name derives from the words \\"Khan\\" (a title used by the Mughal deputies in the region) and \\"desh\\" (country). Another theory suggests the name derives from the words \\"Kanha\\" and \\"desh\\"; \\"Kanha\\" is a name for Krishna, the primary deity worshipped by the Ahir people of the region. Other theories suggests the varying origins of the word \\"Khan\\", including \\"Kanbai\\" (a regional female deity), \\"Kahan\\" (hay or grass) and \\"Khaan\\" (\\"basin\\", as in basin of the Waghur river). A detailed study of the various etymologies of the word Khandesh appears in the book Ahirani Boli by Dr. Ramesh Suryawanshi.  Dialects  Ahirani is a major dialect of Khandeshi. It was originally spoken by the Ahirs (Epic cattle herders) living in the Khandesh region. It is further divided into region-based sub-dialects such as Chalisgaon, Dhule, Malegaon and Dhule group. Ahirani is spoken in the Jalgaon (except Bhusaval, Jamner, Bodwad and Muktainagar) and Nandurbar, Dhule. Outside Khandesh, it is spoken in some parts of Nashik (Baglan, Malegaon and Kalwan tehsils) and Aurangabad. People in the tehsils of Dharangaon, Chopda, Amalner, Sakri, Sindkheda, Dondaicha-Warwade, Shirpur, Taloda, Shahada, Dhadgaon, Akkalkuwa, Navapur, Raver, Parola, Erandol, Satana, India, Malegaon, Baglan also speak Ahirani. In the neighboring state of Gujarat, it is spoken in Surat and Vyara, and in Madhya Pradesh Burhanpur, Ahirani is spoken in and around Amba-Varla. Research by Dr. Ramesh Suryawashi suggests that the Ahirani dialect is also spoken in Dharni tehsil of Amravati district, around the Melghat Tiger Reserve forest area. But it is known as Gavali Boli there. Around 30-35 thousand people speak Gavai boli in 40 villages. According to the 1971 census of India, the number of people who declared Ahirani as their mother tongue was 363,780. A 2011 estimate of the population of the Dhulia, Jalgaon and Nandurbar districts, and the Ahirani speaker tehsils of Aurangabad and Nasik district was 10 million. The non-Ahirs in the region (such as Lewa, Wani, Bhill and Pardeshi castes) started speaking variants of Ahirani mixed with their dialects while interacting with the Ahirs, which led to the birth of other dialects of the language. Chandwadi is spoken around Chandwad hills, Nandubari is spoken around Nandurbar, Jamneri is spoken around Jamner tehsil, Taptangi is spoken by the side of Tapi, Tapti river. Dongarangi is spoken by the side of forest Ajanta hills. All these are region-based names for Khandeshi sub-dialects. Ahirani, Gujar, Bhilau, Maharau, Lewa and Purbhi all are social (caste-based) categories of Khandeshi. Several castes speak their own dialect at home but use Khandeshi for their daily communication outside their communities. The people residing in Nandurbar region of Maha-Gujrat border speak a dialect named as Gujar which is very different from ahirani and close to Gujrathi. These language also used in community and at market places at many towns such as Shahada,Taloda,Mhasawad etc.  Grammar and vocabulary  The Standard Marathi and Ahirani show considerable difference at various levels of structures. This indicates that the source and development of these two dialects are independent. Some of the peculiarities of Ahirani show closeness to Rajashthani and Gujarati. Borrowing and bending the words from Hindi, Marathi and Gujarati, Ahirani has created its own words not found in any of these languages. Ahirani is basically in colloquial form and uses the Devanagari script for its writing. Educated Khandeshis speak standard Marathi as well as Ahirani. In the urban areas, Ahirani is losing its popularity among such people to standard Marathi, but in the rural areas, Ahirani dominates. The language is widely used among the farmers and villagers. It is also known for its secret words used by goldsmiths, cattle sellers, fruit-purchasers, known only to the members of that community.  Literature  Being a rural language, Ahirani has not produced much literature. Bahinabai Chaudhari (1880-1951) is a well-known poet of Khandesh, and the study of her literature is studied and included in Marathi language sources. The language in her poems is different from Ahirani, but influenced by Ahirani. Some say the poet is not Ahirani, but Lewa (a dialect of Khandeshi).  Linguistic research  Dr. RameshSitaram Suryawanshi has authored following works on Ahirani: * Ahirani Bhasha Vaidnynik Abhyasa (1997), a linguistic study, which explains the grammar formation of words and formation of sentences in Ahirani.

He has lost campaigns to represent West Virginia in the United States Senate in 1984, 2006, 2010, and 2012. He was also defeated in the Republican primary in the election for Governor of West Virginia in 1988. Early life, education and career Raese was born in Morgantown, West Virginia. He is the son of Jane Greer Raese and Richard Aubrey \\"Dyke\\" Raese, a former head basketball coach at West Virginia University (WVU). Raese graduated from WVU with a Bachelor of Science degree in education in 1973. While attending West Virginia University he was a member of the West Virginia Beta chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon. He is president and chief executive officer of Greer Industries, a steel and limestone producer. His business interests also include The Dominion Post (Morgantown), the West Virginia Radio Corporation, which owns 32 radio stations, and the MetroNews radio network serving 56 stations. Greer Industries also owns Seneca Caverns, a tourist spot in eastern West Virginia. Chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party During his tenure as Chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party, Raese supported allowing independent voters in West Virginia to vote in Republican Party primaries. He joined with the West Virginia Federation of Young Republicans to promote \\"Initiative, Referendum, and Recall,\\" debating the Democratic Speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates, Chuck Chambers. Political positions Raese supports eliminating the Federal minimum wage, the Department of Education, Department of Energy and the Internal Revenue Service.Politico, John Raese: Abolish Minimum Wage, Oct 12 2010, http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43474.htmlWho Runs Government, Washington Post, accessed Oct 17 2010, Raese opposes abortion, human cloning and federally funded stem cell research. He favors repealing the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and supports the U.S. military's now-defunct Don't Ask Don't Tell policy.John Raese campaign website, Oct 12 2010, http://www.raeseforsenate.org/index.php/category/west- virginia-senate-issues/west-virginia-senate-a-pro-life-conservative/ Who Runs Government, Washington Post, accessed Oct 17 2010, Political campaigns =1984 U.S. Senate election= Raese ran for the U.S. Senate against two-term Governor Jay Rockefeller, during a difficult economic downturn. Rockefeller outspent Raese tenfold, $12 million to $1.2 million. Raese ran as a \\"Reagan Republican\\", a traditional conservative on both economic and social policies, and he challenged Rockefeller's record on such sensitive issues, such as coal mine closures in the state. Some national news organizations were preparing for a possible upset by the little-known Raese as the general election day approached. Raese narrowly lost the U.S. Senate race to Rockefeller in the general election 52%‚Äì48%. Raese challenged the outcome of the race, but without effect. =1988 gubernatorial election= In 1988, Raese ran against three-term Republican Governor Arch A. Moore in the GOP gubernatorial primary, losing 53%‚Äì47%. Moore later lost the general election. =2006 U.S. Senate election= In 2006 Raese ran against Robert Byrd, the longest-serving member of the U.S. Senate and former Senate Majority Leader and Senate Appropriations Chair. Raese won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate with 58 percent of the vote in a field of six candidates. In radio advertisements aired during the primary race, Raese's campaign replayed a tape of an endorsement from Ronald Reagan made during the 1984 Senate race. In the general election, Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky stumped for Raese. Raese stressed the value of the private sector in creating jobs, and the importance of honoring traditional values. He also supported the pro- life movement, the right to bear arms, and tax cuts. During the election, the Byrd campaign criticized Raese for making a comment about Byrd's deceased wife, Erma Ora Byrd. Byrd was reelected by a margin of 64.4% to 33.7%. =2007‚Äì2009= In 2007, Raese's wife, Elizabeth, launched a new statewide women's group, \\"Conservative Women of West Virginia.\\" The group was active for the GOP national and state ticket in the 2008 election. More recently, the group has been supportive of some of the initiatives of the WV Republican Party, including helping with the May 2009 speaking engagement of Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele. In 2008, Raese donated money to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, to the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Jay Wolfe and to the \\"Raese for Senate\\" committee. In the 2008 Republican presidential primaries, he supported former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, donating $1,000 to his campaign in 2007. =2010 U.S. Senate election= Following the death of Senator Robert C. Byrd in 2010, plans were made to hold a special election to fill the unexpired term of his US Senate seat. Republican Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito, daughter of former Governor Arch A. Moore, was initially considered to be a potential candidate for the seat. Raese announced that he was considering a third Senate bid, stating that he might run to her right in a potential primary between the two. Ultimately, Capito declined to run for the seat. Raese subsequently won the Republican nomination, but was defeated by his Democratic opponent, Joe Manchin, in the general election.http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2010/election_2010_senate_elections/west_virginia/question /questions_west_virginia_senate_september_27_2010http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/09/ppp- poll-goper-raese-leads-by-3-points-in-wv-sen-race.php =2012 U.S. Senate election= Raese was unopposed in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate garnering 61,289 votes. He ran against Manchin once again, who received 80% of the Democratic primary ballots, a total for him of 119,725 votes.http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Elections/2012/Senate/West_Virginia/1/ In April 2012, Raese equated smoking bans with Adolf Hitler's yellow badge. He said \\"in Monongalia County now, I have to put a huge sticker on my buildings to say this is a smoke-free environment. This is brought to you by the government of Monongalia County. Okay? Remember Hitler used to put Star of David on everybody‚Äôs lapel, remember that? Same thing.\\" That same day, he referred to President Franklin D. Roosevelt as \\"Fidel Roosevelt.\\" Raese didn't apologize for his statements on Hitler saying \\"I am not going to be intimidated by a bunch of bullshit. I'm not apologizing to anybody or any organization. It's my perfect right to make a speech about meaningful subject matters in this country.\\" He has called guitarist Ted Nugent a \\"patriot\\" for having criticized President Barack Obama. Raese was defeated by his Democratic opponent, Joe Manchin, in the general election. Personal life Raese and his wife Liz have two daughters, Jane and Agnes. Liz is the founder of the Conservative Women of West Virginia (CWWV). They have homes in Palm Beach, Florida, Telluride, Colorado, and Morgantown, West Virginia.Associated Press, Elections 2010, In 2010 Liz Raese was registered to vote in Florida, where their children go to school at The King's Academy in West Palm Beach, so her West Virginia voter registration was purged, leaving her unable to vote for her husband in his 2010 race for the US Senate from West Virginia. Raese, along with Greer Industries colleague Bob Gwynne, designed the golf course at the invitation-only Pikewood National Golf Club in Morgantown, WV.

The object of the mission was to infiltrate the UK in preparation for Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen Seel√∂we in German). Military context Operation Seagull was planned in connection with Abwehr's remit of intelligence gathering for Operation Sea Lion. Despite being planned and launched, the mission was aborted midway during the sea crossing to Ireland. At the time of Seagull's conception, Abwehr chief Wilhelm Canaris had already issued orders that regional Abwehr stations known as \\"Ast's\\" (see Abwehr) were not to attempt to infiltrate into Britain via Ireland for the foreseeable future, due to the dismal failure of Operation Lobster I (\\"Unternehmen Hummer\\" in German) in July 1940. However, Seagull was directed by Army Group Northern France/Belgium via the Brandenburger Regiment attached to Abwehr II anyway. Agents involved Christian Nissen aka \\"Hein M√ºck\\" had already taken part in Operation Lobster I. His orders were to transport an NCO from the Brandenburgers, Helmut Clissmann, and one Abwehr I. radio operator to the southern coast of Ireland to carry out their mission. The vessel chosen was the \\"Anni Braz-Bihen\\". Clissmann was stationed at Westende, Belgium in readiness for the operation. Nissen received his orders from his direct superior in the Regiment, Captain Hollman. Clissmann's mission had two parts. First, he and the radio operator were to be landed by boat in the southern region of Ireland.The spot chosen for the landing was Galway Bay due to Nissen's familiarity with the area gained during his World War I internment in Ireland. Once landed, the two agents were to establish contact with the IRA. After successful contact, Clissmann was to use the help of the IRA to travel to Britain. Once in Britain Clissmann was to seek out suitable guides to help a possible invading force of Brandenburger troops to the Dover area. If travelling to Britain proved impossible, Clissmann was to enlist the help of the IRA in searching within Ireland for guides to the Dover area. In the event of the agents being forced to remain in Ireland, they were to make contact with Captain Hermann G√∂rtz through the German Legation in Dublin. Unfortunately for the Abwehr agents, the entire mission had to be aborted even before reaching the Irish coast. During the seacrossing from France a number of things went wrong; the bilge pump on the boat failed, the Danish mechanic became unconscious after an accident, and the vessel was buffeted by a heavy storm for three days. These events forced Nissen to head back to Brest Bay, France. Involvement of the IRA There was no involvement or prior knowledge of Operation Seagull by the IRA in Ireland, or by agents of the IRA working with Nazi Germany at the time. The mission brief provided by Abwehr II staff to the agents, namely to \\"establish contact with the IRA,\\" provides an insight into the lack of understanding they had of the IRA's strength and presence in Ireland at the time, more than anything that may have come of the plan.

The resulting cabinet, which replaced the Cabinet of Sehested consisting of member of the conservative party H√∏jre, was formed on 24 July 1901 and was called the Cabinet of Deuntzer. The formation of the new cabinet is referred to in Danish as \\"systemskiftet\\", the shift of government. The cabinet marked the introduction of parliamentarism in Denmark and with the exception of the Easter Crisis of 1920 no Danish government since 1901 has been formed against the vote of a majority of the members of Folketinget. There were several internal conflicts within the cabinet. According to Justice Minister Peter Adler Alberti it had 27 crises on minister level, not counting the minor ones, but it did nevertheless manage to institute a number of reforms and in particular an extensive tax reform. The cabinet was replaced by the Cabinet of J.C. Christensen I on 14 January 1905. Formation =Shift of government= Even though the election on 3 April 1901 had reduced H√∏jre's representation in Folketinget to 8 seats of 114, H√∏jre still had a majority of the seats in Landstinget and Hannibal Sehested remained Council President at first regardless of the election results. King Christian IX was however under some pressure to institute a new government that would represent a larger part of the voters. Princess Marie of Orl√©ans, wife of Prince Valdemar and daughter-in-law of Christian IX, was the one to recommend Deuntzer to the king, and she had written a complete step-by-step plan for him on how to get rid of Sehested and H√∏jre. Deuntzer was not an obvious choice for Council President as his only political experience was a failed candidacy for Landstinget 15 years earlier and as he was no more a pronounced member of the Venstre Reform Party than for Hugo Egmont H√∏rring to offer him the position as justice minister in the Cabinet of H√∏rring in 1897, an offer he had declined on the advice of Viggo H√∏rup. Princess Marie knew him from her frequent visits to the office of the East Asiatic Company, where both he and her husband were members of the board, and her main reason for recommending him to the king was the fact that his limited connection to the opposition would prevent his appointment from appearing to be an acknowledgement of parliamentarism. The king made his final decision on whether to make follow Princess Marie's recommendation on 22 May studying the confidential reports of a H√∏jre board meeting and a meeting between the leaders of the party and the editors of the press supporting the party. The reports showed that the party's support of the government mildly put was failing, which was in direct contradiction with Sehested's relaxed description of his situation. That convinced him to ask Sehested to hand in his resignation on 15 July when the king returned from a stay at a health resort. Upon the king's return Sehested turned in his resignation as expected and officially his replacement was yet to be found. Princess Marie had conveniently arranged for Deuntzer to meet the king at a social event at Bernstorff Palace on that evening. During the evening the king asked Deuntzer: \\"So you are a leftist, Mr. Professor?\\",The literal quote in Danish: \\"De er jo venstremand, hr. professor?\\" to which Deuntzer answered: \\"To a degree, Your Majesty.\\"The literal quote in Danish: \\"I nogen grad, Deres Majest√¶t.\\" Apparently this was all he needed to hear, as on the following day he officially asked Deuntzer to form a new cabinet. =Distribution of portfolios= The process of forming the cabinet was not an easy task however. Internally the Venstre Reform Party was split in three groups: The Alberti- wing, the right wing within the party, supported mainly by the farmers of Zealand, the \\"bergians\\" named after the former leader of the party Christen Berg, were supported mainly by the farmers of Jutland and led by the current leader of the party Jens Christian Christensen, and finally the H√∏rup- supporters, forming the left wing within the party, were mainly supported by the voters of Copenhagen and had Viggo H√∏rup, the editor of the newspaper Politiken, as the central figure. The distribution of portfolios became a careful compromise between the three groups and Deuntzer was forced to leave the task of choosing the cabinet member to the leaders of the three groups. His original intention had been for himself to become justice minister and for Ludvig Holstein-Ledreborg to become council president. However both Alberti and Christensen opposed this and Holstein-Ledreborg stated to a journalist that he was not interested in reentering politics at that point in time. Instead H√∏rup himself, even though he was somewhat weakened from cancer, was brought in to represent the H√∏rup-supporters along with Christopher Friedenreich Hage. The new cabinet was officially announced after about a week on 24 July 1901. Cabinet changes The cabinet was changed on 15 February 1902 because of the death of H√∏rup. Hage became the new minister for public works. No changes were made to the cabinet as a result of the 1903 Folketing election and the next change to the cabinet was on 1 February 1904 when Hannes Hafstein took the post as minister for Iceland as the first Icelander. The Constitutional Act of Iceland of 3 October 1903 stated that the minister for Iceland had to be a resident of Reykjav√≠k and be able to read and write Icelandic. The ministry had until then been a part of the justice ministry of Denmark, but with the new Constitutional Act it was made responsible to the Icelandic Althing and Iceland obtained home rule. The fact that Deuntzer had countersigned the nomination of Hafstein was considered Danish meddling in Icelandic affairs, however. Politics =Tax reform= Before 1903 the only direct, Danish tax had been the so-called \\"hartkorn tax\\" on farm land based on a classification of quality, usability and area. The tax reform of 1903 replaced the hartkorn tax with a tax on real estate inspired by the publications of Henry George and introduced a progressive income tax and a wealth tax. Even though the income tax at 1.3%-2.5% would be considered low by modern standards, it was expected to amount to more than half of what the new taxes would bring in. This meant that the tax reform was an extensive redistribution of the tax income generally favoring the farmers and the big landowners in particular at the expense of the town dwellers. =School reform= In an attempt to make the public school system appealing to the entire population a four-year middle school for students over 11 years, was established in 1903 to form a bridge between the Folkeskole and the Realskole (lower secondary school) and the Gymnasium. At the same time the Gymnasium became more up-to-date as Latin and Greek were replaced by English, German, and French as the main subjects of the languages line. Internal conflicts =Alberti's legal reform= The legal reform Alberti presented to the Rigsdag in 1903 was a controversial attempt at controlling violence by reintroducing judicial corporal punishment. Deuntzer was, as a professor of law, strongly opposed to this, and when the law was approved by the Folketing, he threatened to resign if it were approved by the Landsting as well. It was not, however Alberti did manage to reintroduce corporal punishment in 1905 as justice minister in the Cabinet of J.C. Christensen I.

Unlike the typical copy/paste experience in browsers, the Live Clipboard mechanism never needs to display a security dialog to the end user, thus delivering a more streamlined user experience. Live Clipboard is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (version 2.5). As of late 2009, the updated specification, Javascript files and sample code can be found here:  DHTML technical introduction  The Live Clipboard DHTML provides copy/paste functionality for data associated with a web page using the Live Clipboard XML data format. It consists of the following components: *UI elements for displaying the Live Clipboard icon *Javascript objects representing the Live Clipboard object model *Javascript that handles serialization and de-serialization of the Live Clipboard XML data *Javascript callback function registration for retrieving data for copy and pushing data for paste. It is designed to use standard Javascript and CSS techniques to ‚Äúbring the clipboard to the web‚Äù and to work in as many browsers as possible. Currently, it is verified to work in IE 8 and in Mozilla Firefox 3.5.2. The control does not depend on installation of any client-side applications or browser plug-ins, and it never gains access to the contents of the clipboard without explicit user action. = How it works = The control positions a transparent (opacity = 0) input element in a containing \`div\` element with a background .png image of the clipboard icon. When the user gives focus to the input by left- or right-clicking it, tabbing etc. the control script gets the data that should be copied by calling the OnGetLiveClipboardData function. This callback function is implemented by the page developer and returns an instance of LiveClipboardClass containing the data that should be copied to the clipboard. Next, the control script serializes this data to the Live Clipboard XML format, which it sets as the value of the input element and selects. At this point, if the user issues a \\"copy\\" command via the context menu, browser edit menu, command etc., the selected contents of the input are put on the clipboard. Alternately, if the user issues a \\"paste\\" command, the value of the input is replaced with the current data on the clipboard. In this case, the control script detects that the input value has changed, de-serializes the value from Live Clipboard XML format to an instance of LiveClipboardClass, and passes the object to the OnHandleLiveClipboardData function. The paste callback function is implemented by the page developer and responds to the pasted data as desired. Specifically, it might iterate through the present data formats, apply data in any recognized format(s) to the page, make an asynchronous call to the web server to persist state, set up a new feed subscription, etc. It is also valid to do nothing, such as when none of the formats in the pasted data are valid for the associated data. There are mechanisms to use keyboard events to trigger copy/paste. This is accomplished by calling the InitiateKeyboardCopyToLiveClipboard and InitiateKeyboardPasteFromLiveClipboard functions.

Serbia  The Pƒçinja originates from several streams on the western slopes of the Dukat mountain which meet at the village of Radovnica and continue to the west originally under the name of the Tripu≈°nica (Cyrillic: –¢—Ä–∏–ø—É—à–Ω–∏—Ü–∞). The river creates a micro-region of Pƒçinja, with center being the municipal seat of Trgovi≈°te where Tripu≈°nica meets the left tributary of Lesniƒçka reka (Cyrillic: –õ–µ—Å–Ω–∏—á–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–∞) from the south and continues to the west under the name of Pƒçinja. The region represents one of the fastest depopulating and economically least developed parts of Serbia (population of 12,556 in 1971 (34 per km¬≤) and 6,372 in 2002 (17 per km¬≤; down 50%). After the Pƒçinja passes next to the northern side of the mountain of ≈†iroka planina and the village of ≈†ajince where it receives the right tributary of Koƒáurica (Cyrillic: –ö–æ—õ—É—Ä–∏—Ü–∞) from the north, it is prevented to continue to the west by the eastern side of the Rujen mountain and turns south, into the narrow valley between the Rujen and Kozjak mountains. The small village and monastery of Prohor Pƒçinjski are located in the valley. Just after the river passes next to the monastery, after 52 km of flow in Serbia, the Pƒçinja crosses the Macedonian border.  North Macedonia  For the remaining 83 km, the river bends gently to the southwest. It passes next to the villages of Karlovce, Dragomance, Strnovac, Vojnik, Kleƒçevce, Pƒçinja, Studena Bara, Gorno Konjare, Dolno Konjare and the small town of Katlanovo, with the neighboring Katlanovska Banja, the most popular spa in North Macedonia. The upper course in North Macedonia creates a micro-region of Sredorek (Macedonian: –°—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Ä–µ–∫), and the lower a micro-region of Kotorci (Macedonian: –ö–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—Ü–∏), with the gorge of Bader (Macedonian: –ë–∞–¥–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –∫–ª–∏—Å—É—Ä–∞) in between. In the lower course, the Pƒçinja follows the western side of the mountain Gradi≈°tanska and flows into the Vardar river, on the gorge of Taor section of the Vardar's course, halfway between the cities of Skopje and Veles. Katlanovo is located on the highway Skopje-Thessaloniki, and even though some 25 km away from Skopje, a string of Skopje's fast growing suburbs is located along the highway (Jurumleri, Idrizovo, Petrovec), and if the city continues to grow, in some future it will reach Katlanovo and the banks of Pƒçinja.  Characteristics  *The Pƒçinja belongs to the Aegean sea drainage basin. Its own drainage area covers 3.140 km¬≤, of that 1.247 km¬≤ in Serbia and 1.893 km¬≤ in North Macedonia. *The average discharge on the river's mouth into the Vardar is 14 m¬≥/s, and it is not navigable. *All the major tributaries of the Pƒçinja are in North Macedonia: Bistrica, Petroshnica and Kriva Reka from the left; Kumanovska reka, from the right.

It flows to the northwest, with many bends and curves, as it flows through the high, mountain region. The river almost has no settlements (except for the village of Vrulje), before it passes the eastern slopes of the Korijeni mountain and enters the Pljevaljska kotlina (Cyrillic: –ü—ô–µ–≤–∞—ô—Å–∫–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–ª–∏–Ω–∞; Depression of Pljevlja). There, it flows through the Pljevlja coal basin and the city of Pljevlja itself, and continues to the region of Podgora, next to the villages of Radosavec, ≈Ωidoviƒái, Donja Brvenica and the small town of Gradac. The river flows between the region of Bukovica to the north and the northern tip of the Ljubi≈°nja mountain and for the few kilometers forms the border between Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It continues next to the villages of Vikoƒç, Faloviƒái, Godijeno and Brusina, before it empties into the Drina. The city of Foƒça is built at its confluence.  Characteristics  The ƒÜehotina flows for 100 km in Montenegro, and 25 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has no major tributaries, most important being the Voloder, which flows into the ƒÜehotina near Gradac. The river has considerable hydroelectricity potential, but none of it is being used.

(, Football Club Maccabi Netanya) is an Israeli football club based in Netanya. Established in 1934, the club was a founding member of the Israeli League in 1949. After winning their first championship in 1971, the club's golden period lasted until the late 1980s, including three more league titles and a double in 1978. History Maccabi Netanya Football Club was founded in 1934 as a Mandatory Palestinian club and initially played in green and white stripes. The club played their first game against Beitar Netanya in 1935 at the Maccabi stadium, which was located in the center of the city. The club's first season was in 1935‚Äì36 when they played in Liga Gimel which back then was the third tier in Israeli football. After three seasons in Liga Gimel the club won promotion to Liga Bet (second tier), and in the 1941‚Äì42 season they won Liga Bet to secure promotion to the top division which back then was known as the Palestine League. During World War II, the club's activities were suspended due to the situation in Palestine. During the early to mid 1940s, when British soldiers were in Palestine, there were a number of British players who served in military bases near Netanya and played for the club. The most famous were Bertie Mee and Tom Finney, who were the first foreigners to play for the club. The 1943‚Äì44 season of the Palestine League was the first season that Maccabi Netanya played a full season in the top tier of football in the country, they finished the season in the sixth place. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, four of the club's players were killed - Israel Arbaitman, Yehuda Blecher, Haim Goldstein, David Liebster and coach Baruch Feuer. After the establishment of the State of Israel, Maccabi Netanya was among the 13 teams that formed the senior league in Israel. In the 1949‚Äì50 season, Netanya played in the first and only edition of the Israeli League and finished in ninth place. In 1954 the club qualified to the Israel State Cup for the first time and the next season the club finishing in fourth place in the league. After two rather successful seasons, the club had to fight against relegation in the 1955-56 season. Netanya managed to get back in the top of table in the 1957‚Äì58 season as they finished fourth again. In the 1961‚Äì62 season, after a few years in the bottom of the league, the club got relegated to the second division after finishing 12th and final in the league. Netanya played two seasons in Liga Alef until in the end of the 1963‚Äì64 season when they won the league and got promoted back to the top division. With the return of the team to Liga Leumit, the team joined the top ranks, with Mordechai Spiegler playing in its ranks. Spiegler finished three consecutive seasons as the top scorer of the league. In the 1968‚Äì69 season, the team finished third in the league with Spiegler again as the top scorer. After the third-placed finish in 1968‚Äì69, the 1970‚Äì71 season saw Netanya win their first title by a margin of eleven points, back then the largest in Israeli football history. They also reached the State Cup final, but lost 2‚Äì1 to Maccabi Tel Aviv. In 1972‚Äì73 Neyanya finished thirteenth in Liga Leumit, avoiding relegation by only two points. However, the following season they won their second title. In 1975 they changed their kit to play in black and yellow. They won a third title in 1977‚Äì78, and completed the double by beating Bnei Yehuda 2‚Äì1 in the State Cup final. They also finished as winners of their group in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. A fourth championship was won in 1979‚Äì80 by a margin of ten points, whilst their fifth title, in 1982‚Äì83 was won by a fourteen-point margin. In the same season they won the League Cup, a feat repeated the following year. In 1986‚Äì87 and 1988‚Äì89 they reached the League Cup final, but lost on both occasions. In 1994‚Äì95 Netanya finished bottom of Liga Leumit and were relegated to Liga Artzit, in the same season the youth team won the youth championship. After winning the league in 1998‚Äì99 they returned to the top division. However, they were relegated again in 2003‚Äì04 after finishing second from bottom, though they made an immediate return to the top division after finishing as Liga Leumuit runners-up in 2004‚Äì05, a season in which they also won the Toto Cup Leumit. In December 2005 Daniel Jammer, a Jewish German businessman bought the club for a fee of $1,500,000. In 2006‚Äì07 the club finished as Premier League runners-up, a feat repeated the following season. In April 2008 Lothar Matth√§us was appointed manager. Although the club led the league in the early part of the 2008‚Äì09 season, they eventually finished fourth and Matth√§us was sacked and replaced by Nati Azaria. The 2010‚Äì11 season saw the club finishing sixth in the top playoff games. The next season Netanya finished in fourth place when they shared the same number of points as the runners-up. This was quite an achievement considering the fact that the club did not have a stable budget behind them or an owner to invest in the club. They were relegated again in 2012‚Äì13 after finishing second from bottom. In August 2013 Eli Segav and Yossi Maor took over as the new owners of the club. Netanya made an immediate return to the top division after finishing as the champions of Liga Leumuit in the 2013‚Äì14 season, a season in which they also reached the State Cup final, losing 1‚Äì0 to Ironi Kiryat Shmona in front of more than 22,000 supporters of Netanya. The club got relegated again at the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. This season is regarded as the worst season the club has ever had in the first tier of Israeli football and most have said it was the worst in the history of the club. Doron Osidon was appointed the chairman of the club by the mayor of Netanya. Shlomi Dora was signed as the manager of the club. At the start of the season five players got severely injured (including the main goalscorer and captain Eran Levy) which caused for many problems. Dora got sacked after the club did not do well, Reuven Atar got called to replace him. After three months of no real change and barley winning any points, Atar was sacked as well. Guy Tzarfati was called up to be the caretaker manager and after he lost a State Cup game against Sektzia Nes Tziona of the third division he was sacked and was replaced by Meni Koretski who could not save the sinking ship. Koretski decided to quit on March 26. Omer Peretz who retired at the start of the season (after he was one of the players that got injured), became the manager of the club. In June 2016 Eyal Segal (a known die hard supporter of Maccabi Netanya) took over as the new owner of the club and declared the goal is to get promoted at the end of the season. The club started the 2016-17 season with a deduction of 9 points, but still managed to do the unthinkable as they got promoted back to the top flight of Israeli football as the Leumit champions. In the 2018-19 season, the club reached the State Cup final in a replay of the 1978 final against Bnei Yehuda, only this time Netanya lost 4-5 in penalties. Rivalry There is a strong rivalry between Netanya and Beitar Nes Tubruk Netanya. Originally, there were hopes of the two clubs uniting so as not to split allegiances of kids in the city. The merger never came to fruition and since, the two clubs have been at each other's throats both claiming that the other has forced a child not to switch clubs, which is illegal in Israel. On one occasion when two Tubruk players came to shake hands with Netanya players after a derby match in Liga Leumit LeNoar, they were subsequently left out of the team for the club's next league match . The senior derby only took place a handful of times when both clubs played in the second tier, in the 1939 season, 1940 season, 1941‚Äì42 season, 1962‚Äì63 season and in the 1963‚Äì64 season. The 1986‚Äì87 season was the only season the two teams played in the top division at the same time. The first game took place in Tubruk Stadium with 9,000 people in attendance, Yigal Menahem scored the only goal for Maccabi. The derby also took place in the State Cup during the 1947 first round and the 1984 seventh round. There's also a strong rivalry between Netanya and Hapoel Kfar Saba, games between the two are often called \\"Derby HaSharon\\" because the two clubs are known to be the major teams from the Sharon plain. The rivalry was at its peak in the 1981‚Äì82 season which saw the two clubs going head to head for the championship with Netanya losing the title in the final game of the season. Since the late 1990s, the strongest rivalry has probably been Hapoel Beer Sheva. Fans The current Maccabi Netanya's organization fans are Ultra Diamonds, established in 2018 After the disintegration of the Diamonds Army 09 (2009-2018). Maccabi Netanya Fans, 2018 Maccabi Netanya audience is the audience who most frequently named public value of the first round of the Premier League ‚Äì Plan for kicking the violence and racism of the lots. The organization fans have three wins title seasons 2009/2010, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013. Stadium The club plays its home matches at the 13,800-capacity Diamond Stadium, Netanya, which was opened in October 2012. The club former stadium was the 7,500-capacity Sar-Tov Stadium, which was commonly known as HaKufsa (lit. The Box). It was named after Yosef Sar-Tov, who was amongst the club's founders, and was its first chairman. \\"The Diamonds\\" nickname etymology \\"The Diamonds\\" nickname origin is in the large diamonds industry that was in the city of Netanya, in the beginning of diamonds industry in Israel in early 1940s. In the 1940s 33 factories started to work in Israel, mostly in Netanya and Tel-Aviv, and Netanya was nick named \\"Diamonds City\\".

In late 2005 Philippines President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo decided that the province would host the 12th ASEAN Summit and 2nd East Asia Summit in December 2006, which was later moved to January 12‚Äì15, 2007, due to Typhoon Utor. The Philippines was supposed to host the twin summits in December 2007 but Myanmar, the original host for 2006, backed out. Since the province lacked a stand-alone convention centre with complete facilities for a large and prestigious international gathering like the ASEAN Summit, Cebu Governor Gwendolyn Garc√≠a revived the \\"mega dome\\" project but with the design revised as a convention centre instead of a sports arena. The external structure would still be that of a \\"spinning disc\\". A few weeks afterwards a new design was put forwards and was considered, since it was cheaper and easier to build (granting that it was smaller in size too) and that there was a time constraint that the Cebu Provincial Government had to stick to. Construction for the substructure began in April 2006 and work on the superstructure itself, which was largely made up of structural steel, glass and aluminum cladding, began three months after. The centre was finished four months later in late November and was officially inaugurated on January 6, 2007. It has been closed since the October 2013 Bohol earthquake, having suffered major damage, and has since fallen into disrepair.http://www.philstar.com/cebu- news/2013/10/26/1249550/cicc-closed-over-p32m-quake-damage Acquisition of the Mandaue City Government The facility is owned by the Provincial Government of Cebu. In October 2016, it was announced that the City Government of Mandaue will be acquiring the CICC. The city government will pay the provincial government every year from 2016 until 2019. The four payments will amount to about . Upon the first payment by the city government, the convention center will be transferred to the city government. Facilities The convention centre features an International Media Center, a large Plenary Hall, an Exhibition Hall and several Meeting Rooms.

Retrieved 9 March 2010 Wilson (15 February 1876 ‚Äì 15 October 1930), better known as E. H. Wilson, was a notable British plant collector and explorer who introduced a large range of about 2000 of Asian plant species to the West; some sixty bear his name.Eliot Tozer, \\"On the trail of E.H. Wilson,\\" Horticulture, November 1994:59. Career Wilson was born in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire but the family soon moved to Shirley, Warwickshire, where they set up a floristry business.D. J. Mabberley, 'Wilson, Ernest Henry (1876‚Äì1930)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 He left school early for employment at the local nursery of Messrs. Hewitt, Warwickshire, as apprentice gardener, and, aged 16, at the Birmingham Botanical Gardens; there he also studied at Birmingham Municipal Technical School in the evenings, receiving the Queen's Prize for botany. In 1897 he began work at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, where he won the Hooker Prize for an essay on conifers. He then accepted a position as Chinese plant collector with the firm of James Veitch & Sons, who were eager above all to retrieve the dove tree, Davidia involucrata. \\"Stick to the one thing you are after,\\" advised Harry Veitch, who had more than a dozen plant hunters on payroll, \\"and don't spend time and money wandering about. Probably every worthwhile plant in China has now been introduced to Europe.\\"Quoted by Tozer 1994:50. After six months at Veitch's Coombe Woods Nursery, Wilson travelled west towards China, stopping for five days at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts, where he carried a letter of introduction to Charles Sprague Sargent and studied techniques for shipping seeds and plants without damage. He continued across the US by train, and sailed from San Francisco, reaching Hong Kong on 3 June 1899. Sargent had suggested he head straight to Simao to talk to Augustine Henry, who had seen a unique dove tree twelve years previously. Though the tree had been recently cut down when Wilson reached it, he rediscovered the specimens noticed by P√®re David 600 km away in Yichang, Hubei.Years later, the seedlings grown from these were identified as Davidia laeta, not D. involucrata. Wilson collected for two years in Hubei Province, reaching isolated mountain valleys with an intrepid spirit that has made him legendary, before returning to England in April 1902 with seed of 305 species, and 35 Wardian cases of bulbs, corms, rhizomes, and tubers, many of which Veitch introduced into Western commerce, as well as dried herbarium specimens, representing some 906 plant species.Tozer 1994:55. L. regale On his first return Wilson married Helen Ganderton, of Edgbaston, but within six months Veitch sent him out again, this time with the yellow Chinese poppy, Meconopsis integrifolia as his objective. In 1903 Wilson discovered the Regal lily in western Sichuan along the Min River. He revisited the site in 1908 and collected more bulbs, but most of these rotted while en route back to the Arnold Arboretum in Boston. In 1910 he again returned to the Min valley, but this time his leg was crushed during an avalanche of boulders as he was carried along the trail in his sedan chair. After setting his leg with the tripod of his camera, he was carried back to civilisation on a three-day forced march. Thereafter he walked with what he called his \\"lily limp\\". It was this third shipment of bulbs that successfully introduced the Regal Lily into cultivation in the United States. A few of the many plants introduced to western cultivation from his first expedition include Acer griseum, Actinidia deliciosa (kiwifruit), Berberis julianae, Clematis armandii, Clematis montana var. rubens, Davidia involucrata, Ilex pernyi, Jasminum mesnyi, and Primula pulverulenta. Many of the species he collected were formally named by Maxwell T. Masters. In his reminiscence If I were to Make a Garden, Wilson claimed to have introduced 25 species of wild rose to the West. One of them, Rosa willmottiae was named after Ellen Willmott a famous, important sponsor, expert and writer of \\"The Genus Rosa\\". Early in the 20th century Henry Morris Upcher, owner of Sheringham Park, Norfolk, England obtained Rhododendron seeds of various types from Wilson. Plants from this source which can be found at the garden include Rhododendron ambiguum, R. calophytum and R. decorum, among others. Zealand. K.

In subsequent years he became a collector for Sargent at the Arnold Arboretum, and made further expeditions to China in 1907, 1908, and 1910, as well as to Japan (1911‚Äì1916), where he collected 63 named forms of cherry blossom. One of his footprints in Japan is Wilson's introduction of the gigantic \\"Yaku sugi stump\\" called in Yakushima to Western readers in 1914.The old men of the mountains: Yomiuri Shimbun His hypothesis made in 1916, that the Japanese cherry Prunus √ó yedoensis was a hybrid, was supported by hybridisation experiments in Japanese national laboratories in 1965. He returned to Asia in 1917‚Äì1918, exploring in Korea and Formosa. Upon return to the Arnold Arboretum in 1919 he was appointed Associate Director. Three years later he set off for a two-year expedition through Australia, New Zealand, India, Central and South America, and East Africa. In 1927 he became Keeper of the Arnold Arboretum.

He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and received an honorary M.A. degree from Harvard University and a D.Sc. degree from Trinity College. Over 100 plants introduced by Wilson have received the First-Class Certificate or Awards of Merit of the Royal Horticultural Society of London.

General overview  Kolubara is formed by the two small rivers Obnica and Jablanica. Obnica is the river in Western Serbia that springs at the foot of the mountain Medvednik. It flows eastward, through the villages of Suvodanje, Bobova, Majinoviƒá, Priƒçeviƒá and Zlatariƒá, and at the city of Valjevo meets the river Jablanica and forms Kolubara. The Obnica is 25 km long. Jablanica originates on the eastern slopes of the Jablanik mountain, just few kilometers away from Obnica. It curves around Paraƒç mountain and next to the village of Balinoviƒá, before it meets Obnica in Valjevo. Jablanica is 21.5 km long. This is also the beginning of the long region of the Kolubara valley, divided in two large parts, referred to as Upper (gornja) Kolubara and Lower (donja) Kolubara (around the Belgrade's suburb of Obrenovac).  Upper Kolubara  At Valjevo, the Kolubara receives the river Gradac from the right and forms the Valjevo valley between the surrounding mountains, in which it spills in several parallel flows. After Valjevo, the most populous city in western Serbia, there are no major settlements on the river, except for the villages of Mlaƒëevo and Slovac and the river receives the right tributaries of Ribnica and Lepenica and the left tributary of Rabas. At Slovac, near the confluence of the right tributary of the Toplica, the Kolubara carved the epigenetic Slovaƒçka sutjeska, which separates Upper and Lower Kolubara. Upper Kolubara constitutes most of the modern Kolubara District of Serbia.  Lower Kolubara  The Kolubara turns north and continues to flow in several parallel flows, receiving in this section its major tributaries: Ljig River, Turija, Lukavica and Pe≈°tan, from the right; Kladnica and Tamnava, from the left. Due to the floods, even though its valley is densely populated, there are no settlements on the river itself, until it reaches Obrenovac, few kilometers before it empties into the Sava (only navigable near its mouth in Sava). However, many large villages and towns are located in the vicinity of the Kolubara: Lajkovac, Jabuƒçje, Lazarevac, ≈†opiƒá, Skobalj, Vreoci, Mali Borak, Veliki Crljeni, Dra≈æevac, Misloƒëin and Bariƒç, where it flows into the Sava. Lower Kolubara itself is divided in two sub-regions, the (upper) Kolubara coal basin and the (lower) Obrenovac micro-region.  Kolubara coal basin  In Neogene, the region of Kolubara was a huge bay of the Pannonian Sea (Kolubarski zaliv) As a result of abundant vegetation in the ancient sea, region of Kolubara and neighboring Tamnava (around Kolubara's longest tributary) today are immense lignite field which covers over . It is estimated that coal deposits are as much as 22 billion tons, with coal layers being to deep, and over 20 million tons of coal are being extracted each year. Major mines are Rudovci, Kolubara (at Veliki Crljeni) and Kosmaj, with many surface digs being developed lately. With the mines actively covering , Kolubara mine is the largest one in the Balkans. A series of coal based power stations are built in the basin, including Kolubara (130 MW, at Veliki Crljeni), Nikola Tesla B-1 (in 1983) and Nikola Tesla B-2 (both 615 MW, in Obrenovac). Because of its importance for industry and economy in general, the municipality of Lazarevac, to which the coal basin mainly belongs, was attached administratively to the City of Belgrade in 1971. After three years, on 19 September 2007 the river course between Vreoci and Veliki Crljeni was transferred to the new artificial river bed. This will allow the opening of a new surface coal field Veliki Crljeni in September 2008 with an estimated coal reserves of over 30 million tons.Politika daily, 20 September 2007, p.14 The mining projects at Kolubara have been plagued with corruption: in 2011, 16 current and former members of Elektroprivreda Srbije, the operator, were arrested on suspicion of embezzlement. In addition to this, resettlement procedures for affected local communities were, according to civil society organizations, not executed in accordance with Serbian law.Kolubara lignite mine, Serbia, CEE Bankwatch Network. There are possibilities for the development of the tourism, given the vicinity of Belgrade. There are two natural scenic overlooks above the mines. One is \\"Tamnava\\", from which the archeological sites within the mines can be observed, and the other is Medo≈°evac, which is considered as the largest scenic overlook in the Balkans, with the view over the entire mines, which look like \\"the surface of the Moon\\". The Processing section has an exhibition of the old steam locomotives which were used in the mines. There are also several lakes formed in the former mine shafts. The process of displacement of the Kolubara river bed in an effort to make possible exploitation of the \\"Veliko polje G\\" coal seam began in 2007. Phase 2 of the project was finished in July 2017 when another of the river was conducted into the new, displaced bed. \\"Veliko polje G\\" has an estimated coal reserves of 36,4 million tons.  Characteristics  Serbian first army during the Battle of Kolubara, a significant Serbian victory, that took place near Kolubara river in Valjevo. Due to the many long tributaries creating a branchy system within the river's drainage area, the short Kolubara drains relatively large area of . It belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin. The river is not navigable, but its valley is very important for transportation. Here are located Belgrade-Valjevo road, parts of Belgrade-≈†abac road, Ibarska magistrala (Highway of Ibar) and the Belgrade-Bar railway. The Kolubara was the site of one of the major battles on the Balkans in the World War I, the Battle of Kolubara in 1914.

He ruled and expanded the First Serbian Principality (Rascia), and won several wars against other family members that sought the crown. He was the first Serbian monarch with a Christian (non-Slavic) name. Petar was the son of Gojnik, the youngest son of Vlastimir (r. 831‚Äì851) of the first Serbian dynasty (ruling since the early 7th century).  Early life  Petar was born between 870 and 874, as the son of the Prince Gojnik, the youngest son of dynastic founding father Vlastimir.Konstantin Jireƒçek His Byzantine Christian name, in relation to the previous generation of pagan names, shows the spread of Christianization among the Serbs.The entry of the Slavs into Christendom, p. 209 At the time of his birth, Serbia was ruled as an oligarchy consisting of the three brothers Mutimir, Gojnik and Strojimir, although Mutimir, the oldest, had supreme rule.ƒêekiƒá, ƒê. 2009, \\"Why did prince Mutimir keep Petar Gojnikovic?\\", Teme, vol. 33, no. 2, pp. 683‚Äì688. PDF In the 880s, Mutimir seized the throne, exiling his younger brothers and Klonimir, Strojimir's son, to the court of Boris I of Bulgaria. This was most likely due to treachery. Young Petar was kept at the Serbian court of Mutimir for political reasons, but he soon fled to Branimir of Croatia.  Civil wars  Mutimir died in 890 or 891, leaving the throne to his oldest son, Pribislav. Pribislav had only ruled for a year when Petar returned in 892, defeating him in battle and seizing the throne. Pribislav fled to Croatia with his brothers Bran and Stefan. Bran later returned and led an unsuccessful rebellion against Petar in 894. Bran was defeated, captured and blinded (a Byzantine tradition meant to disqualify a person from taking the throne). In 896, Klonimir returned from Bulgaria, backed by Tsar Boris, and invaded Serbia, taking the important stronghold Dostinika (Drsnik, in KlinaRelja Novakovic, Gde se nalazila Srbija od VII do X veka (Where Serbia was situated from the 7th to 10th centuries) [Serbia, Belgrade: Narodna knjiga, 1981], pp. 61‚Äì63.http://www.rastko.rs/isk/vkorac-medieval_architecture.html). Klonimir was defeated and killed.The early medieval Balkans, p. 154  Bulgarian alliance  After several failures to capture the throne by other Vlastimiroviƒás, including the one backed by the Bulgarians, Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria recognized Petar as ruler. He was put under Simeon's protection, resulting in a twenty-year peace and the Serbian-Bulgarian alliance (897‚Äì917). Petar was probably not happy with his subordinate position, and may have dreamed of reasserting his independence; his situation and the succession wars of the three branches of Vlastimir's sons were to play key parts in the coming Bulgarian-Byzantine War. Christianity presumably was spreading in his time. Also, since Serbia bordered Bulgaria, Christian influence and perhaps missionaries came from there. This would increase during the twenty-year peace. According to Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio, Petar ruled under the suzerainty of Leo VI and was at peace with Bulgaria for twenty years.Konstantinos Porphyrogenitos, De Administrando Imperio ch. 32, p. 156  Bulgarian-Byzantine War, Expansion to the west, and death  Constantine VII and Symeon dining. (Madrid Skylitzes, fol. 120r) On May 11, 912, on the death of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise, his brother Alexander III succeeded him. The unpopular, inexperienced, ill and possibly chronically drunk Alexander ruled until his death on June 6, 913. This was ideal for Symeon, who had his troops waiting in Thrace to attack Byzantium. In August 913, Symeon appeared at the walls of Constantinople, seeking no plunder, only the crown. Symeon had, in contrast to Tsar Boris, been schooled in Constantinople, embracing Byzantine ideology, and wanted to rule a joint Roman-Bulgarian Empire as Roman Emperor. Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos recognized Symeon as Emperor of Bulgaria, and married his daughter to Constantine VII. In February 914, Zoe Karbonopsina, the mother of Constantine, quickly ousted Nicholas as regent (although letting him remain the Patriarch), and she, as regent, nullified the title given to Symeon, as well as the marriage plans. Zoe's acts enraged Symeon, who went on to conquer Thrace. The Byzantines had no choice but to look for allies, sending envoys to the Magyars, Pechenegs and Serbs. As Peter had secured the eastern border, he turned to the west, where he sought to strengthen his grip on the local Slavic principalities. He defeated Ti≈°emir of Bosnia, annexing the valley of Bosna. He then expanded along the Neretva, annexing the Narentines, where he seems to have come into conflict with Michael Vi≈°eviƒá, the ruler of Zahumlje (with Travunija and most of Duklja), who was an important Bulgarian ally. Petar (since 897 theoretically a Bulgarian vassal, though not necessarily a willing one) met with the strategos of Dyrrhachium, Leo Rhabduchus, in Neretva,Srbi izmeƒëu Vizantije, Hrvatske i Bugarske where he was offered money and greater independence in exchange for leading an army (also containing Tourkoi, Magyars) against Symeon. It seems that Petar had now agreed to join the Byzantines, but this has not been fully determined. Michael Vi≈°eviƒá heard of the possible alliance between Serbia and the Byzantines, and warned Symeon. Petar was entombed in the church of Peter and Paul in Stari Ras. In 917, a Byzantine army led by Leo Phokas the Younger invaded Bulgaria, but was decisively defeated at the Battle of Achelous on 20 August 917. After Achelous, Symeon sent an army led by Pavle (the son of Bran), to take the Serbian throne, but failed, as Petar proved a good opponent. Symeon sent generals, Marmaim and Theodore Sigritzes,BBNB, p. 27 persuading Petar (through an oath) to come out and meet them, then captured and took him to Bulgaria where he was put in prison, dying within a year. His remains are entombed in the Church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul in Stari Ras, the capital.Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja: Ljetopis' Popa Dukljanina Symeon put Pavle on the Serbian throne.

Life =Early life= She was the daughter of Sir John Drummond, of Stobhall, near Perth, 11th Thane of Lennox and Chief of Clan Drummond, and Mary Montifex, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Sir William de Montifex, Justiciar of Scotland. It has been erroneous postulated that her father was the same John Drummond that was a brother to Margaret Drummond, Queen of Scotland but as this does not align with any historical dates, the latter John was probably a close ancestor. Anabella and her husband the King, depicted on the 1562 Forman Armorial. She married John Stewart (the future Robert III of Scotland) in 1367. Soon, she was enveloped in a power struggle with her husband's brother, Robert. Since Anabella and John did have two daughters, but no sons for several years, he was a supporter of a law that would bar women from inheriting the throne. =Queen= Anabella was crowned with Robert at Scone Palace when he came to the throne in 1390. She continued bearing children until she was past forty and had her last child, the future James I of Scotland, in 1394. King Robert, an invalid since 1384 due to an accident with a horse, grew increasingly despondent and incompetent throughout his reign and was not capable to govern. During this time he is said to have said to her that he should be buried in a dung heap with the epitaph \\"Here lies the worst of kings and the most miserable of men\\". Because the king was not able to rule, Anabella was prompted to manage state affairs as de facto ruler. The chronicles of Scotland generally praise queen Anabella and her conduct as queen. Protecting the interests of her oldest son, David, she arranged a great tournament in 1398 in Edinburgh, where her oldest son was knighted.Marshall, Rosalind K. (2003). p. 47. In April of that year she also called a council where he was created Duke of Rothesay and Lieutenant of the Realm in the same year. Shortly after his mother's death he would be imprisoned by his uncle and died in mysterious circumstances. David was described as debauched, self-indulgent and erratic, and the Duke of Albany did not have to fight hard to control him. The Fife burgh of Inverkeithing was a favourite residence of the queen. Her presence is still recalled in the sandstone font, decorated with angels and heraldry, which she presented to the parish church of the town, one of Scotland's finest surviving pieces of late medieval sculpture. Anabella died in Scone Palace in October 1401, and was buried at her birthplace of Dunfermline. With the loss of her protection, her eldest son David would become the prey of his uncle, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, dying shortly after.

As a restaurateur he also runs The Gilbert Scott at the St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel. Wareing succeeded Michel Roux Jr. as a judge since the seventh series of MasterChef: The Professionals.  Early life  Wareing was born in Southport, Lancashire, in 1970. His father was a fruit and potato merchant who had contracts with schools to provide their produce for school dinners. At the age of 11 his first food-industry related job was with his father, packing potatoes and riding alongside deliveries. He was paid 10p per bag of potatoes packed, all of which went straight into his Post Office saving account. At a young age, Marcus was informed by his father that the business was no longer viable as schools moved on to using pre-prepared frozen food instead of fresh produce. He would later credit his father's long hours with inspiring his own work ethic. At Stanley High School, he found he had a natural talent for cooking. He went on to attend Southport College, where he took a three-year City & Guilds course in catering. Career Wareing first worked at the Savoy Hotel under chef Anton Edelmann in 1988 at the age of 18 where he was employed as a commis chef, before leaving in 1993 to join Albert Roux at Michelin starred Le Gavroche where he first met Gordon Ramsay. Stints at other restaurants in New York City, Amsterdam and at Gravetye Manor in Sussex followed. Wareing joined Gordon Ramsay's Aubergine when it opened in 1993, where he became Sous Chef behind Head Chef Ramsay and would go on to work with him over the course of the following 15 years, which led to Wareing being called Ramsay's prot√©g√©. While he was at Aubergine in 1995, Wareing was awarded the title of Young Chef of the Year by the Restaurant Association. He would later credit Ramsay with teaching him to cook, describing it as \\"the most important time in my life\\". He left Aubergine for a year in 1995 to work with Daniel Boulud in America, and Guy Savoy in France. His return to the UK was also to be his first head chef role, of new restaurant L‚ÄôOranger, which was owned by A-Z Restaurants, which had also owned Aubergine, with stakes held by both Wareing and Ramsay. At the age of 25 he earned his first Michelin star as head chef whilst at L‚ÄôOranger. He gave Angela Hartnett her first job in a restaurant. Following a fall-out between Ramsay and A-Z Restaurants over Wareing's contract at L'Oranger, which saw Ramsay quit Aubergine to open Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, Wareing followed suit by leaving L'Oranger, forcing the restaurant into temporary closure. A-Z Restaurants commenced legal proceedings against the pair, and reopened L‚ÄôOranger with Wareing's former sous chef, Kamel Benamar, as the new head chef. The legal case ended in Ramsay and Wareing paying an out-of-court settlement to the Restaurant group. Ramsay and Wareing worked together to open P√©trus in 1999, with Wareing becoming head chef and operating the restaurant on behalf of Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH), at 33 St James's Street, London. The name came from the French wine P√©trus, which was Ramsay's and Wareing's favourite. Wareing promptly regained the Michelin star he had previously held, with P√©trus being named as a one star restaurant seven months after opening. The restaurant was moved into the Berkeley Hotel in 2003 where it replaced Pierre Koffmann's La Tante Claire, in the same year that Wareing became Chef Patron of the Grill Room at the Savoy Hotel, and he was named Chef of the Year by Caterer and Hotelkeeper's Catey Awards. The return to the Savoy meant that he was competing against Anton Edelmann, his former boss from the River Room at the hotel. Rather than serve a menu similar to the French driven P√©trus, Wareing chose to continue to serve the British cuisine that the Grill Room was known for, including his version of previous menu items such as steak and kidney pudding and potted shrimps. P√©trus went on to be awarded two Michelin stars and five AA Rosettes, while the Savoy Grill achieved its first Michelin star in the hotel's history in 2004. Wareing also opened an American- style diner at The Savoy called Banquette, and converted the previous P√©trus location into La Fleur. He was voted Restaurateur of the Year at the Tatler Restaurant Awards in 2004, and Harden's restaurant guide selected him as the fourth-best chef in London, although La Fleur closed due to problems with the lease for the site. In 2007 P√©trus was awarded its second Michelin star. Following several months of rumours regarding the restaurant, the Berkeley Hotel confirmed in May 2008 that it was going to work with Wareing to launch his only solo restaurant, and he would take on P√©trus' lease from 19 September 2008 onwards. Wareing had previously complained of interference in the kitchen by GRH, and wanted to come out from under Ramsay's shadow, but later admitted that he had engineered the situation so that he could go out on his own. The split with Ramsay and GRH resulted in a public legal battle and feud between the three parties, which when resolved resulted in Wareing stating in an interview for Waitrose Food Illustrated magazine that Ramsay left him bitter and conflicted; \\"half of me thinks he‚Äôs a sad bastard and the other half still adores him.\\" He went on to describe Ramsay as a celebrity chef who wasn't involved in the industry anymore. The legal dispute was resolved with Ramsay gaining the rights to the P√©trus name, and Wareing signing a gag order regarding the situation but continuing to open his restaurant Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley. Wareing remarked of the situation, \\"If I never speak to that guy again for the rest of my life, it wouldn't bother me one bit.\\" Ramsay later responded regarding the feud that he wishes Wareing \\"all the best\\". Wareing's self-named restaurant won the Best Restaurant in London Award by Harden's guide in 2008 and 2009, was awarded two Michelin stars in 2009, and was named Time Out's restaurant of the year in 2010. The new P√©trus was opened around the corner from the Berkeley Hotel at 1 Kinnerton Street, Knightsbridge. Ramsay later joked, that with Heston Blumenthal also opening his new restaurant nearby, the three of them could \\"all have a fight in the street at four in the morning\\". Once Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley opened in 2008, Marcus Wareing Restaurants was founded. The group has since expanded and now comprises three restaurants. In 2009 Wareing was named by magazine GQ as their chef of the year. In 2011, Wareing opened his second restaurant, The Gilbert Scott, in the St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel. GRH had also made a bid to open a restaurant in the space, but was rejected in favour of Wareing's proposal. The restaurant was named after the architect of the hotel, Sir George Gilbert Scott. Wareing believes in promoting good quality, seasonal British food in his menus, and using small suppliers. After an extensive refurbishment in 2014, Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley reopened as Marcus. In September 2014, Wareing opened Tredwells in Upper St Martin's Lane, Seven Dials, London, with Group Operations Director, Chantelle Nicholson, who also acquired the role of Chef Patron of Tredwells in June 2016. In August 2020, Chantelle and Marcus announced that Tredwells is now solely owned by Chantelle, and that he would have no further involvement. = Television and other media = Wareing was first featured on television in the Channel 4 1998 documentary series Boiling Point, documenting his time as Gordon Ramsay's sous chef, his move to P√©trus and the award of his first Michelin star. He was also selected as one of 13 chefs chosen to recreate Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper in 2003. The work was photographed by John Reardon, and features Wareing throwing a brie across into the air whilst standing in the place of Simon the Zealot from Leonardo's work. In 2006, Marcus Wareing and Simon Rimmer represented the North of England in the BBC television series Great British Menu. Wareing beat the Manchester-based chef to go on to the final round. In the final the public chose for him to cook his dessert of egg custard tart with Garibaldi biscuits for the Queen's 80th birthday banquet which was on 17 June 2006. He has continued to be a judge for later seasons for the Great British Menu, something which has occasionally brought him into conflict with other chefs such as Johnnie Mountain. He has criticized some shows in the past such as MasterChef, saying that it has inspired young chefs to chase fame on television and be lazy in the kitchen, although he has appeared on MasterChef, MasterChef: The Professionals and Celebrity MasterChef in the past. Wareing has succeeded Michel Roux Jr. on the seventh series of Masterchef: The Professionals after Roux, Jr.'s contract with the BBC was terminated for advertising potatoes. Wareing has released seven cookbooks to date. Under his new publisher, HarperCollins, he released Marcus at Home in 2016, which spent five weeks in The Sunday Times top 10 bestseller list (cookery books), and New Classics, which was published 2 November 2017. His latest cookbook, Marcus Everyday, was released on 31 October 2019.  Personal life  He has a brother named Brian, who is a catering teacher. Marcus is married to Jane, with whom he has three children, Jake, Archie, and Jessie. He met Jane while he worked at Gravetye Manor, where he was second chef and she worked on reception. After moving to London to work with Ramsay at Aubergine, Wareing kept the relationship going by commuting out to Sussex every Sunday. Ramsay was the best man at his wedding in 2000, and is godfather to Wareing's eldest son Jake. He has raised money for the charity Action Against Hunger, whilst working at the Taste of London festival, and in 2012 competed in a White-collar boxing charity event with other chefs and catering staff for the Hilton in the Community Foundation, having been an amateur boxer in his youth. He has lent his name to the Environmental Justice Foundation campaign to promote sustainable fishing. Wareing has said his favourite cookbook is one by chef Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park in New York City.

He died on 21 July 2014. On 18 December 2008, Lukman was appointed Minister of Petroleum Resources by Nigerian president Umaru Yar'Adua, holding office until March 2010. Birth, education and early career Lukman was born in Zaria, Kaduna State. He trained as a mining engineer at the College of Arts, Science, and Technology, Zaria (now Ahmadu Bello University), and then at Imperial College, London. He earned a higher degree in mining engineering from the University of Mining and Metallurgy in Leoben, Austria (1967‚Äì1968). He obtained a degree in Mineral Economics from McGill University, Montreal in 1978, and an honorary doctorate degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Bologna in Italy. His first job in the mining industry was as an Assistant Mining Engineer with A B Statsgruvor of Sweden (1962‚Äì1964). After returning to Nigeria, Lukman was appointed an Inspector of Mines, later Senior Inspector and then Acting Assistant Chief Inspector in the Federal Ministry of Mines & Power in Jos, Plateau State (1964‚Äì1970). He then became general manager of the Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (1970‚Äì1974). By 1979 Lukman had become general manager and chief executive officer of the Nigerian Mining Corporation, Jos. Senior government and OPEC positions Lukman was appointed Minister of Mines, Power and Steel from 1984 to 1985 in the government of General Muhammadu Buhari. In 1986 he was appointed Federal Minister of Petroleum Resources, holding that position until February 1990. In that role, he was also chairman of the board of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. He was briefly Minister of Foreign Affairs between January and September 1990. He was Chairman of the board of directors of the National Electric Power Authority (1993‚Äì1994). From 1986 he served eight consecutive terms as OPEC president. Lukman was elected OPEC secretary general on 22 November 1994, succeeding Dr. Subroto of Indonesia, whose three-year term ended on 30 June 1994. Lukman was a compromise choice between two competing candidates, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili of Iran and Alirio Parra of Venezuela. He was re-elected to a second term in 1997, holding office until the end of 2000. He was a central figure in the agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to control oil prices early in 1999, followed by agreements to reduce production levels, which led to a surge in prices towards the end of the 1990s. Fourth republic career When Olusegun Obasanjo came into office at the start of the Nigerian Fourth Republic the President retained direct control of the Oil Ministry. Lukman was appointed Special Adviser on Petroleum and Energy Matters to the President in June 1999, replacing Godwin Aret Adams, and Chairman of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). In July 1999 his office announced that 47 offshore Exploration and Production licences awarded by the government to local companies had been cancelled, including 11 highly attractive deep-water blocks given in March 1999 to companies with links to the military. He said the blocks would be open to commercial tender from both local and foreign companies. He was in favour of restructuring the NNPC to make it a fully commercial enterprise, but did not agree that it should divest its controlling stake in the oil producing joint ventures, and at that time was not in favour of rapid deregulation of the domestic fuels market. Lukman resigned in November 2003. The resignation was said to be due to a dispute over oil sector reform with the group managing director of the NNPC. Jackson Gaius Obaseki. The friction had apparently been building up after Lukman completed his term as OPEC president in early 2002, and after Obasanjo moved control and administration of oil blocks from the Petroleum Resources ministry to the NNPC in June 2002. He then became the Chairman of Afren Nigeria when it was established in May 2005. He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and served on the SPE board as regional Director for Africa. In 2007, Lukman became a member of the Supervisory Board of Dietsmann NV of the Netherlands, a leading International Operation & Maintenance company in the upstream energy sector. Lukman was appointed Honorary (unpaid) Advisor on Energy and Strategic Matters to President Umaru Yar'Adua in August 2007. In December 2008 Lukman was appointed Minister of Petroleum Resources, and resigned from his position with Afren, putting his holdings in a blind trust. In February 2010 there were rumours that Lukman had tendered his resignation after a shakeup in the cabinet by the new acting President, Goodluck Jonathan, but that it had not been accepted. In March 2010, he warned that the scarcity of petroleum products in Nigeria would only get worse as long as the government held back on deregulating the industry. He left office on 17 March 2010 when Acting President Goodluck Jonathan dissolved his cabinet. Honours Lukman was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1989 and Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur of France in 1990, as well as being conferred with the First Class rank of the Order of the Liberator from the Republic of Venezuela. He was the first African ever to be honoured with the Fellowship of the Imperial College, University of London.

Several of them hint towards brutal beatings and plans to have her family killed. The opening track, \\"Mafia Style\\" is reference to Gordon's meetings with mobsters on New York's Mulberry Street. According to Jackson, \\"I was hearing a whole lot that I probably shouldn't have been hearing. I was the only girl, and they called me 'the kid', because these were older men and they would say, 'Is the kid going to talk?' and [Gordon] would always say, 'No, the kid doesn't talk,' because I would always say, 'I know nothing about nothing.'\\" The title track, \\"Starting Over\\", was recorded in 2006, but plans to release it as a single that year were scrapped.

Culturally, modern Frisians and the (Northern) Dutch are rather similar; the main and generally most important difference being that Frisians speak West Frisian, one of the three sub- branches of the Frisian languages, alongside Dutch. West Frisians in the general do not feel or see themselves as part of a larger group of Frisians, and, according to a 1970 inquiry, identify themselves more with the Dutch than with East or North Frisians.

(1846‚Äìc. 1902 [1913(?)) was a scout, guide, and spy for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Serving first with the Moccasin Rangers, a pro-Confederate guerrilla group in present-day West Virginia, she later joined the Confederate Army and continued to serve as a guide and spy under General Stonewall Jackson. Childhood Born Nancy Hart in 1846 in Raleigh, North Carolina, she and her family moved to Tazewell, Virginia, when she was an infant. Her mother was first cousin to Andrew Johnson, who became president after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.Hart lived with her family in West Virginia until the outbreak of the Civil War, at which time she developed great sympathy for the Southern cause. During the early years of her life on her family's farm, she became an expert with rifles, pistols, and riding horses. She could reportedly operate a gun or handle a horse as well as a man. She eventually moved in with her sister and brother-in-law, Mary and William Clay Price. William Clay Price was not a soldier, but did things for the Confederate army in the evenings. One day the Union soldiers came to question him. They took him away and killed him down the road from his family. This fueled Nancy's rage and hatred toward the Union cause. Civil War For nearly two years Hart worked for the Moccasin Rangers as a spy and a scout, posing as a farm girl to gather intelligence. She saved the lives of a number of wounded Confederate soldiers by hiding them with sympathizers. She also personally led several cavalry raids against federal outposts. After one such skirmish she was briefly captured, but she persuaded the Union soldiers to let her go based on the fact she was a woman. In early 1861, after a contingent of Union troops passed through her town, Hart's sympathy for the Confederacy prompted her to leave home and join the Moccasin Rangers, led by the infamous Perry Conley. Conley died in the summer of 1862, and with his loss the Moccasin Rangers disbanded, although Hart continued to spy on Union movements. She became a valuable asset to the Rangers, serving both as a spy and a guide to the local region. Hart became so famous and such an enigma for Union forces in West Virginia that a reward was offered for information leading to her capture in 1862. Shortly thereafter, she and a female friend were captured by Union troops led by Lt. Col. Starr and taken prisoner in Summersville, West Virginia. Here, she was photographed unsmiling and unemotional, by an itinerant photographer.Canon, Jill. Civil War Heroines. Santa Barbara, CA: Bellerophon Books, 2000. According to legend, Hart did not smile because of the attire she had to wear for the picture. Civil War telegrapher Marion H. Kerner, an officer who befriended Hart at the encampment, later made her story famous in the magazine, Leslie's Weekly.An 1882 account claims that Kerner had Hart photographed .pp.105-106That same night, Hart escaped from the Union camp on Starr's horse and joined a regiment of about 200 Confederate soldiers led by Major R. Augustus Bailey (the Moccasin Rangers had been disbanded since the death of Perry Conley). A week later, the Confederate troops overran Summersville, burning many of the public buildings and taking Lt. Col. Starr prisoner. Marion Kerner was also captured, but due to the kind treatment he had given Hart during her own imprisonment, she convinced the Confederate officers to release him. However, he was promptly recaptured after attempting to relay a telegram to Union forces. He was released at the war's end. Francis Miller's 1911 \\"Photographic History of the Civil War\\" repeats the claim Hart was captured by Lt. Col. Starr of the 9th West Virginia; a photograph was taken of Hart; she killed a guard with his own gun and a week later led a Confederate unit which captured Starr and the 9th West Virginia July 25, 1862.Miller history Vol. VIII p. 287 Official Records of the Civil War mention the capture of Companies \\"A\\" and \\"F\\" of the 9th West Virginia Infantry at Summersville, West Virginia, July 25, 1862‚Äîbut have no mention of an arrest/escape of a Nancy Hart in 1862.Official Records Series 1 Volume 12 {Part II} Likewise the Official W.V. Adjutant General Report on the 9th W.V. do not show any casualties for July 18‚Äì25, 1862WV Adjutant General Report .pp.229-259 After the war After the war, Hart married the former Ranger Joshua Douglas, and they lived in Spring Creek near Cordova in Greenbrier County during the remainder of their lives. They had two sons, George and Kennos. Nancy later lived with her son on Manning Knob seven miles south of Richwood where her grave now lies. Records of Nancy's death are conflicted. Though her tombstone says she died in 1902, there are no official records of her death in Greenbrier County, where she lived, or in state records. Her husband's death record in the Greenbrier County Courthouse lists him as \\"Married\\" at the time of his death in 1907. Eyewitnesses put her alive and well in Richwood in 1911 when Halley's comet was visible. \\"This means there will be another war,\\" she is alleged to have said. Her two granddaughters, Moppie McCollum and Myrtle Hollandsworth, were interviewed in 1992 and both recalled attending Nancy's funeral around 1913. The marker on Nancy's grave was erected by a 4th grade class at Beaver Elementary School in Craigsville, WV, in 1987 as a class project. The students got the date of Nancy's death from Boyd Stutler's account of her life in his 1963 book West Virginia in the Civil War. Her grave is located on Manning Knob in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, south of Richwood. The grave of Joshua Douglas is in the Richwood City Cemetery in Richwood, WV. A mural depicting the famous photograph of Nancy Hart is also in Richwood. Adaptation Nancy Hart's story has been recreated in the novel Rebel Hart by Edith Hemingway and Jacquelin Shields. In 1992, Susan Matthis Johnson's musical drama \\"Bury Me By Nancy Hart\\" was produced in Richwood, West Virginia by the Mill Whistle Players. The play was produced with cooperation from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the West Virginia Department of Culture and History. The musical drama retells the story of Nancy Hart's capture and escape in the early years of the Civil War. But the story begins in April 1965 when a fire tower watchman was laid to rest beside the grave of the Confederate spy. Ivan Morgan Hunter was a Southern sympathizer who had become enamored of Nancy's memory while working in a fire tower over her grave. Ivan and his gravedigger recount through flashbacks the famous story of how Nancy outwitted her captors and escaped. She led a cavalry of Stonewall Jackson's men into Summersville and burned it to the ground. The play was produced in 1993 in Summersville, West Virginia, as an outdoor drama by the Old Main Players. Johnson also wrote the script for \\"Nancy Hart, Live!\\" a one-woman show starring Pam Butcher also produced by the West Virginia Department of Culture and History's \\"History Alive\\" program in 1994. In 2006, Johnson published an article in the Hur Herald entitled, \\"Will the Real Nancy Hart Please Come Forth.\\" This article cites various historical accounts of Nancy Hart's life.

Neutral and non-aligned countries shown in green. Third- Worldism is a political concept and ideology that emerged in the late 1940s or early 1950s during the Cold War and tried to generate unity among the nations that did not want to take sides between the United States and the Soviet Union. The concept is closely related but not identical to the political theory of Maoism-Third Worldism. The political thinkers and leaders of Third- Worldism argued that the North-South divisions and conflicts were of primary political importance compared to the East-West opposition of the Cold War period. In the Three-World Model, the countries of the First World were the ones allied to the United States. These nations had, and still have, less political risk, better functioning democracy and economic stability, as well as higher standard of living. The Second World designation referred to the former industrial socialist states under the influence of the Soviet Union. The Third World hence defined countries that remained non-aligned with either NATO, or the Communist Bloc. The Third World was normally seen to include many countries with colonial pasts in Africa, Latin America, Oceania and Asia. It was also sometimes taken as synonymous with countries in the Non-Aligned Movement, connected to the world economic division as \\"periphery\\" countries in the world system that is dominated by the \\"core\\" countries. Third-Worldism was connected to new political movements following the decolonization and new forms of regionalism that emerged in the erstwhile colonies of Asia, Africa, and the Middle-East as well as in the older nation-states of Latin America, including pan-Arabism, pan-Africanism, pan-Americanism and pan-Asianism. The first period of the Third-World movement, that of the \\"first Bandung Era\\", was led by the Egyptian, Indonesian and Indian heads of states such as Nasser, Sukarno and Nehru. They were followed in the 1960s and 1970s by a second generation of Third-Worldist governments that emphasized on a more radical and revolutionary socialist vision, personified by the figure of Che Guevara. At the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s, Third Worldism began to enter into a period of decline.  Leaders and theorists  Several leaders have been associated with the Third-Worldism movement, including: * Gamal Abdel Nasser * Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez * Zulfikar Ali Bhutto * Jawaharlal Nehru * Ho Chi Minh * Kwame Nkrumah * Josip Broz Tito * Houari Boumediene * Julius Nyerere * Patrice Lumumba * Michael Manley * Sukarno * Muammar Gaddafi * Amilcar and Lu√≠s Cabral * Thomas Sankara Theorists include: * Frantz FanonMacey, David (2012) Frantz Fanon: A Biography (Second Edition), Verso Books, 13 Nov (Page 20) * Samir Amin * Arghiri Emmanuel  See also  * Maoism (Third Worldism) * Non-Aligned Movement * Third World socialism * Three Worlds Theory  References   Further reading  * Bangura, Abdul Karim, \\"Toward a Pan-Third Worldism: A Challenge to the Association of Third World Studies (Journal of Third World Studies, Spring 2003) * Hadiz, Vedi R., The Rise of Neo-Third Worldism?: The Indonesian Trajectory and the Consolidation of Illiberal Democracy, * Lopes Junior, Gutemberg Pacheco, The Sino-Brazilian Principles in a Latin American and BRICS Context: The Case for Comparative Public Budgeting Legal Research Wisconsin International Law Journal, 13 May 2015 * Malley, Robert, The Call From Algeria: Third Worldism, Revolution, and the Turn to Islam (UC Press) * Malley, Robert, \\"The Third Worldist Moment\\", in Current History (November 1999) * Slobodian, Quinn, Foreign Front: Third World Politics in Sixties West Germany (Duke University Press) * Third Worldism or Socialism?, by Solidarity UK Category:Political terminology ","title":"Third-Worldism"},{"id":"5046480","text":"La 1, LA 1 or LA-1 may refer to: * Louisiana Highway 1, a state highway in Louisiana * Louisiana State Route 1, a former state highway in Louisiana, also known as the Jefferson Highway * Louisiana's 1st congressional district, an American congressional district In broadcasting: * La 1 (Spanish TV channel), a Spanish TV channel * RSI La 1, a Swiss Italian-language TV channel ","title":"LA1"},{"id":"5046492","text":"D.

She debuted on-screen during 2000 and left the show the following year. Development Sara develops feelings for Roy Farmer (Miles Petit) despite him being in a relationship with Claire Toomey (Tina Hall). She tries to seduce Roy by climbing naked into his bed. Petit told Sally Brockway from Soaplife that Roy does not feel able to be with Sara due to their age difference. He initially assumed a paternal role with her and thought her to be vulnerable. He feels sorry for her and gives guidance as he knows about drug addiction. Petit said that \\"Sara's still very immature and has never had a proper relationship. Roy sees her feeling for him as some schoolgirl crush and thinks he'd be taking advantage if he succumbed. He's been very strong because he's smitten with her.\\" Sara decides to prove Roy wrong by attending a self-help clinic. Petit said that this development changed Roy's perception of Sara and ponders a future with her. Though Petit stressed that \\"he would desperately like to get involved, but he believes he should be protecting her.\\" Meanwhile, Claire does not want Sara around because she knew Sara was taking Roy from her. Petit believed that his character would have to leave Claire because he truly loved Sara. Storylines A rebellious teenager who clashed with her young stepmother Nikki Warrington, Sara eventually left home to work as a lap dancer, spending much of her income on cocaine. Sara had relationships with Benji McHugh and Arlo Dean. Sara remained with Arlo longer. One night in August 2000, Sara overdosed on some Ecstasy Arlo had given her and nearly died. Arlo, racked with guilt, panicked and fled into the night. Fortunately, Sara survived. Luisa, Sara's mother made a reappearance in her life for several months., Luisa's boyfriend Tony made a pass at Sara which she denied. After all of this, Tony eventually left Charnham. Later on, Sara discovered her Brother Luke was having an affair with Nikki. This revelation tore the family apart. Sara then formed a relationship with Roy Farmer, despite being much younger than he was. This eventually fizzled out due to the age gap and a constant clash with Claire Toomey, who Roy was sharing his house with at the time. After getting herself back on her feet, she left to join Andrew in Wales. In December 2001 when Luke returned to Charnham, he mentioned Sara had gone missing while staying with friends (off- screen), she was eventually found. Reception A Soaplife reporter said that \\"selfish Sara\\" had a \\"warped logic\\" when she chose to sleep with her mother's boyfriend, Tony.

The species can be exceptionally tall for a moss with stems often exceeding though rarely reaching , but it is most commonly found at shorter lengths of . It is widely distributed throughout temperate and boreal latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and also found in Mexico, several Pacific Islands including New Zealand, and also in Australia. It typically grows in bogs, wet heathland and along forest streams. Description Polytrichum commune is a medium to large moss. It is dark green in colour, but becomes brownish with age. The stems can occur in either loose or quite dense tufts, often forming extensive colonies. The stems are most typically found at lengths of 5 to 10 cm, but can be as short as 2 cm or as long as 70 cm. They range in stiffness from erect to decumbent (i.e. reclining) and are usually unbranched, though in rare cases they may be forked. The leaves occur densely to rather distantly, and bracts are present proximally. The leaves typically measure 6 to 8 mm in length, but may be up to 12 mm long. When dry they are erect, but when moist they are sinuous with recurved tips and are generally spreading to broadly recurved, or sharply recurved from the base. The leaf sheath is oblong to elliptic in outline, forming an involute (i.e. with inward rolling margins) tube and clasping the stem. This sheath is typically golden yellow and shiny, and it is abruptly contracted to the narrowly lanceolate blade. Using a microscope, the marginal lamina can be seen to be level or erect, narrow, and typically 2 to 3 cells wide, though sometimes as many as 7 cells wide. It is toothed from the base of the blade up to the apex, with the teeth being unicellular and embedded in the margin. The costa, or central stalk of the leaf, is toothed on the underside near the apex, and is excurrent, meaning it extends beyond the end of the apex, ending in a short, rough awn. Cross section of a leaf showing parallel lamellae (perpendicular to leaf surface) at 125x magnification The lamellae, ridges of cells that run along the leaf surface, are crenulate (i.e. with small rounded teeth) in profile and are 5 to 9 cells high. Their margins are distinctly grooved with 2 rows of paired, projecting knobs. The marginal cells, when observed in section, may be narrow, but are more typically enlarged and wider than those beneath. They are retuse (i.e. with a rounded apex with a central shallow notch) to deeply notched, and in rare cases are divided by a vertical partition. These cells are smooth and brownish in colour and have relatively thick cell walls. The sheath cells measure 60 to 90 ¬µm long by 10 to 13 ¬µm wide. These cells may be elongated rectangles or strongly linear structures up to 20 times long as wide. They become narrower toward the margins. Marginal lamina cells are 10 to 15 ¬µm wide and are subquadrate (i.e. nearly square). Close-up of capsules (after shedding of calyptra) The plants are sexually dioicous. The leaves of the perichaetium have a long sheath with a scarious (i.e. membranous) margin, while the blades themselves are greatly reduced, gradually narrowing to a finely acuminate tip. These blades have toothed margins, are denticulate to subentire in outline, roughened to almost smooth, and have a costa that is excurrent. The seta, or capsule stalk, is 5 to 9 cm long, and is stout and yellowish to reddish brown in colour. The capsule is 3 to 6 mm long, slightly rectangular to cubic in shape, and brown to dark reddish brown in colour. It is sharply 4 winged, inclined to horizontal, and glaucous when fresh. The peristome measures 250 ¬µm, is pale in colour and has 64 teeth. The calyptra is golden yellow to brownish and completely envelops the capsule. The spores measure 5 to 8 ¬µm, but may be up to 12 ¬µm. Physiology Polytrichum commune is an endohydric moss, meaning water must be conducted from the base of the plant. While mosses are considered non-vascular plants, Polytrichum commune shows clear differentiation of water conducting tissue. One of these water conducting tissues is termed the hadrom, which makes up the central cylinder of stem tissue. It consists of cells with a relatively wide diameter called hydroids, which conduct water. This tissue is analogous to xylem in higher plants. The other tissue is called leptom, which surround the hadrom and contains smaller cells. This tissue is, on the other hand, analogous to phloem. When these two tissue types are taken into account along with the species' exceptional height, it becomes clear that common haircap moss is quite a unique moss considering that the majority of species show little differentiation of conducting tissue and are restricted to much smaller stem lengths. Cross section of a leaf showing parallel photosynthetic lamellae at 400x magnification. The green cells contain chloroplasts. Another characteristic feature of the species (and the genus) is its parallel photosynthetic lamellae on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Most mosses simply have a single plate of cells on the leaf surface, but common haircap moss has more highly differentiated photosynthetic tissue. This is an example of a xeromorphic adaption, an adaptation for dry conditions. Moist air is trapped in between the rows of lamellae, while the larger terminal cells act to contain moisture and protect the photosynthetic cells. This minimises water loss as relatively little tissue is directly exposed to the environment, but allows for enough gas exchange for photosynthesis to take place. The microenvironment between the lamellae can host a number of microscopic organisms such as parasitic fungi and rotifers. Additionally, the leaves will curve and then twist around the stem when conditions become too dry, this being another xeromorphic adaptation. It is speculated that the teeth along the leaf's edge may aid in this process, or perhaps also that they help discourage small invertebrates from attacking the leaves.

Played by Robert Knepper, he is part of the main group of characters in the series and is part of the Fox River Eight. After guest- starring in the series' second episode, \\"Allen\\", the actor became one of the regular cast members. The character was introduced into the series as a fellow prisoner of the protagonist, Michael Scofield (played by Wentworth Miller), at Fox River State Penitentiary. As the leader of a white supremacist group, T-Bag is the most villainous member of the Fox River Eight. In the second season, the character's storyline veers from the main plot as a separate subplot. As the series progresses, more of the background story of the character is revealed. The character has appeared in A&E;'s Breakout Kings, portrayed by Knepper. Appearances Bagwell appears in every episode of the first season except the series pilot, episode 4 \\"Cute Poison\\" and episode 5 \\"English, Fitz or Percy\\". He does not appear in three episodes of the second season: \\"Scan\\", \\"Disconnect\\" and \\"The Message\\". Bagwell appears in every episode in seasons three and four. A younger version of the character, played by Michael Gohlke, appeared in one episode via a flashback sequence in \\"Bad Blood\\". =Season 1= Theodore Bagwell in Season 1 Theodore \\"T-Bag\\" Bagwell is the leader of the Aryan gang inside Fox River. A racist and a pedophile, he is detested by most other inmates, such as John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare) and Benjamin Miles \\"C-Note\\" Franklin (Rockmond Dunbar), but his status within the Alliance for Purity protects him from attacks. Upon the arrival of Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) at Fox River, Bagwell wants to ensnare him as his personal plaything, but is unsuccessful. During a race riot in episode \\"Allen\\", his cellmate and lover is fatally wounded. Believing Scofield was responsible, Bagwell seeks revenge but is stopped by Abruzzi, who has his goons assault him, sending him to the infirmary after which the character is absent for two episodes. When he returns in the episode \\"Riots, Drills and the Devil\\", Bagwell instigates a full-scale riot, during which he accidentally learns of the escape attempt and threatens to tell the other inmates if Michael and the others do not include him; the others have no choice but to agree. At the end of the riot, Bagwell defies the orders of Michael and Abruzzi and murders a guard that could expose the escape. He later frames his friend and fellow Aryan gang member Trokey for the murder. Following this, Bagwell becomes a fully-fledged member of the escape team in the episode \\"The Old Head\\", blackmailing them to include him. Bagwell is initially an endless source of friction on the escape team, testing the others' patience with racist taunts, and is a constant strain on Michael's conscience. Throughout the season, T-Bag is shown as having a sexual interest in other inmates, and coerces his new cellmate Seth into a sexual relationship. After Seth hangs himself, Bagwell moves on to harass newly arrived inmate Tweener, who had alienated himself among Fox River's prison population. Michael, who was feeling guilty about Seth's death, finally confronts Bagwell with a crowbar to the knee and tells him to leave Tweener alone. In the following episodes, friction continues to increase between Bagwell and the other members of the escape team. When the group discovers that they have one too many for a successful escape, Abruzzi gives Bagwell an ultimatum in the episode \\"Odd Man Out\\": back out of the escape or die. Bagwell also learns that his cousin James Bagwell and his son had been killed and is deeply upset. Knowing that Abruzzi was behind it, Bagwell seeks revenge, and slashes Abruzzi's throat with a razor blade in a failed attempt to kill him. Bagwell is among one of six inmates included in the first unsuccessful escape attempt in the episode \\"End of the Tunnel\\". Bagwell is more loyal to the team in the season's later episodes, contributing to keep the escape tunnel hidden and engaging in reluctant relations with a transvestite inmate to further the escape plan. In the episode \\"Bluff\\" his skills at rigging a deck of cards also help the team. Upon learning in \\"The Key\\" that Abruzzi has returned to the prison, Bagwell is frightened and makes a second attempt on Abruzzi's life but is stopped by C-Note, who reminds him that Abruzzi is providing their transportation. Abruzzi claims to have forgiven Bagwell, but the characters keep a wary eye on each other for the rest of the season. In the final episode of the season, Bagwell escapes from Fox River along with Michael, Abruzzi, C-Note, Tweener, and three other inmates. In order to ensure his safety, he handcuffs himself to Michael, knowing that it will keep Abruzzi from killing him. Abruzzi gets his revenge when he cuts off Bagwell's cuffed hand with an axe, seriously wounding him and leaving him for dead. Despite this, Bagwell survives and eludes capture. His last scene of the season features the character staggering through the woods with his severed hand tucked into his armpit. =Season 2= Theodore Bagwell in Season 2 Bagwell has his hand reattached by a veterinary surgeon named Dr. Marvin Gudat, whom he murders afterwards. Bagwell then bleaches his hair to change his appearance, and begins his four episode long journey to Utah, to locate the money Charles Westmoreland had hidden there. In the fifth, sixth and seventh episodes, he rejoins part of the main cast as the group of five fugitives dig for Westmoreland's five million dollars under a garage. Bagwell tricks the other fugitives, stealing all the money, and sets out to find Susan Hollander, the woman who betrayed him. From the eighth episode onwards, Bagwell's storyline separates from the main plot, which concerns the protagonists escaping and later deciding to solve the conspiracy. In the following episode, \\"Unearthed\\", Bagwell arrives at Hollander's house, which has been vacated and is for sale. He is captured at the house by Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) and Roy Geary (Matt DeCaro) after hiding the five million dollars in a locker at a bus station. The next episode follows Bellick and Geary's torture of Bagwell as they try to discover where he has hidden the money. During the torture, the key to the locker that Bagwell had hidden in his sock falls out. The three men scuffle to retrieve it. Bagwell grabs the key and swallows it. Bellick and Geary tie Bagwell to a toilet in the house and shove Copenhagen tobacco in his mouth, along with laxatives. Bagwell passes the key, which has the location information on it. They clean it up, and use plastic handcuffs to attach his wrist to a radiator. Bagwell escapes from the cuff in \\"Bolshoi Booze\\" by re-severing his hand. Geary betrays Bellick and takes the money to an upscale hotel. Bagwell, having placed a tracking device in the bag, tracks it down and kills Geary by smashing his head with a champagne bottle. Before leaving with the money, Bagwell frames Bellick for Geary's murder, by placing Bellick's credit card receipt in Geary's dead, bloody hand. In the \\"fall finale\\" episode \\"The Killing Box\\" the last episode to air for 2006 in the United States, Bagwell sees a Vietnam war vet in a bar, who has a prosthetic hand. It's implied that Bagwell killed the man, as in his next scene of the episode, Bagwell is in possession of the prosthetic hand. He then takes advantage of a postal worker with his wily charms to gain access to Susan Hollander's new address. The postal worker genuinely likes Bagwell, until she recognizes him from a Wanted poster on the wall. Ever the survivalist, Bagwell eliminates her. Bagwell eventually locates Susan, which served as one of the episode's cliffhangers. In his next two appearances of the season, he holds Susan and her children hostage in their home in Ness City, Kansas. He takes them to his childhood home in Alabama in \\"Bad Blood\\", where he reveals that they are his \\"salvation\\" and that he wants to become part of their family. He also explains that he is incapable of having children, presumably because of the nature of his own conception, and that the Bagwell bloodline will die with him. Throughout the episode he is haunted by flashbacks of his childhood, including the sexual abuse he received from his father. Susan rebuffs him, however, saying that she is not able to love him. Bagwell is heartbroken by her rejection and finally leaves them, calling the police to release them from his home. Beginning from the eighteenth episode, the next part of Bagwell's storyline concerns his decision to travel to Thailand. After taking the identity from a therapist he deliberately kills, Bagwell buys a ticket to Bangkok and boards a stop-over flight from Chicago, which coincidentally is the same plane Bellick is flying on. Bagwell recognizes Bellick at Mexico City International Airport in the episode \\"Sweet Caroline\\" and is forced to hide, consequently losing his money in the luggage carousel. He then grapples with a security guard in an attempt to retrieve the money, but fails to overpower him or retrieve the money. He runs away to avoid being captured. Later, security footage of him fleeing is transmitted on a Mexican news station. After narrowly avoiding Sucre and Bellick in the episode \\"Panama\\", Bagwell travels to Panama; there he murders a prostitute. During an unseen encounter, Bagwell is coerced by Agent Kim into aiding the Company's plot to capture Lincoln and Michael, who are also in Panama. Kim's plot fails in the following episode, \\"Fin Del Camino\\", however, and T-Bag finds himself being chased by Bellick, Sucre, and Michael. He escapes Bellick by shooting him in the leg, but is captured soon after by Sucre and Michael. Bagwell escapes once again by stabbing Sucre in the chest with a screwdriver but is followed by Michael to an abandoned house. After Michael refuses Bagwell's truce (feeling responsible for everyone Bagwell has killed since escaping from prison), the two fight. Michael ultimately apprehends Bagwell by viciously impaling his remaining hand to the floor and leaving him for the Panamanian police. He then is transferred to a Panamanian cell, where Bellick is also imprisoned. In his last appearance of the season, Bagwell is seen screaming in a Panamanian jail, a man from the Company leaving him imprisoned for \\"getting caught\\". Bagwell is the fifth member of the Fox River Eight to be taken down by the authorities, and the second member not to die upon interception (the first being C-Note). =Season 3= Imprisoned in Sona along with Michael, Bellick, and Mahone, Bagwell is once again able to charm his way to an easier prison life than most, ingratiating himself to Lechero, a drug lord who is the most powerful man inside. Michael soon blackmails Bagwell about his pedophilic past, in order to gain access to Lechero's cell phone. Bagwell gets Michael the cellphone, but when it is put back Lechero notices that it had been moved. In order to deflect suspicion, Bagwell gets Lechero to question the loyalty of his right-hand man, Sammy, who has been openly hostile to Bagwell. Lechero is successfully manipulated into enlisting Bagwell as his personal spy, increasing Bagwell's position in the prison hierarchy. Bagwell then gains the trust of Lechero's head drug smuggler and dealer, Nieves, only to then kill him by suffocating him with a plastic bag. He also covers up his murder by making it look like a drug overdose, and as a result replaces Nieves on Lechero's crew in the prison. He also protects Sister Mary Francis when the guards enter Sona, developing a liking for her in the process. When she steals Lechero's money, he diverts blame from her on to him and is punished for it by Lechero. Later, when James Whistler is accused of murder and set to be killed, Bagwell attempts to 'help' Michael by asking him to frame his rival Sammy for the murder but Michael refuses to go through with it. When Michael and Whistler are caught trying to escape Sona twice, T-Bag becomes suspicious and figures out that Michael is trying to escape. He blackmails his way onto the team but, along with Bellick and Lechero, is tricked by Michael and captured to allow the others to escape. After the escape, he is tortured until he says Fernando Sucre knows everything that happened about the escape. He finds the bird book that Whistler dropped and puts it into his pocket. He then is taken back to Sona and forms an ambitious plan to kill Lechero. He tricks Lechero into supplying $50,000 for an \\"escape\\" and then smothers him in front of a shocked Bellick. T-Bag then goes to the masses and hands out part of the $50,000 to all the cons. He begins the chant \\"all cons are equal\\" and ingratiates himself with everybody, leaving T-Bag as the new ruler of Sona. =Season 4= T-Bag's character is once again central to the plot, as he holds Whistler's bird book. As mentioned by Lincoln in the premiere episode, a riot in Sona led to T-Bag, Sucre, and Bellick escaping between the third and the fourth season. Much of T-Bag's character arc in this season is devoted to exploring the friction between his discovered yearning for legitimacy and his desire to seek revenge on Michael for leaving him behind in earlier seasons. After crossing the border, T-Bag begins to uncover the clues in the bird book and finds documents conjured up by Whistler to portray Cole Pfeiffer, a top salesman at a corporation called GATE. This forces T-Bag's character to become critical to the plot. T-Bag's storyline is initially separated from the other main characters, and he spends most of his screen time attempting to carry on his charade as the top salesman for the Gate Corporation, while spending most of his time trying to decipher the contents of Whistler's bird book. Eventually, another sales manager exposes him as a fraud, and he quickly flees the building before being arrested. This begins his involvement with the main plotline. In the next episode, he is taken captive by former Company operative Gretchen Morgan, who interrogates him for his role in obtaining Scylla, The Company's little black book. T-Bag learns that the bird book is a means to this end, and that there are people prepared to pay large sums of money for Scylla. For the next few episodes, T-Bag and Gretchen form a partnership, and while she murders the co-worker that exposed T-Bag, he takes Trishanne, the secretary from Gate Corporation, hostage to lure Michael to him and forces him at gunpoint to decipher the clues in Whistler's bird book. They eventually discover the book contains blueprints to the Gate Corporation building, including a path to where Scylla can be decrypted. While forcing Michael at gunpoint into the secret compartment, Bagwell is surprised by Mahone, who along with Michael, captures him. T-Bag is freed in the next episode at the urging of Gretchen, and Michael and his team reluctantly accept him as an ally, as T-Bag's access to Gate is valuable to the plan. In the following episodes, T-Bag appears mainly in scenes at Gate, where he continues to play a salesman. It is established that, together with Gretchen, he is planning on double crossing Michael and his team after they steal Scylla, in order to sell it to a Chinese crime syndicate for 125 million dollars. By the episode \\"Quiet Riot\\", it becomes apparent that Gretchen is clearly the more ruthless and devoted to the plan, while T-Bag begins to grow increasingly attached to his new life and his dialogue shows that he wishes that he actually was Cole Pffeifer rather than Theodore Bagwell. Because of this, the character often shows a softer side in this part of the season. For instance after he learns about the death of Bellick, T-Bag seems to be somewhat upset, despite the nature of their relationship in past seasons. However, he is still shown as intent on exacting revenge on Michael. T-Bag and Gretchen are waiting in T-Bag's office with machine guns in \\"Selfless\\" prepared to ambush the Scylla team when they return. When T-Bag's boss Mr. White spots Gretchen's gun under the table, she takes the entire company hostage. Seeing his chance at a new life at Gate being destroyed forever, T-Bag reluctantly helps her take the GATE employees hostage, but in the same episode T-Bag is arrested by Trishanne (who is actually an under- cover federal agent sent by Homeland Security agent Don Self). At the end of the episode, Michael's team is successful in getting Scylla and hands it over to Self who, in the episode's twist ending, betrays everyone and steals Scylla. After Self murders Trishanne, he forces T-Bag to help him track down Gretchen by giving him the home address of her sister Rita and daughter Emily, whom T-Bag holds hostage while Gretchen and Self find a new buyer for Scylla. In the episode \\"Just Business\\", T-Bag continues to mourn the loss of his new life. When a bible salesman asks to come in, T-Bag believes him to be a Company agent and takes him hostage. After saying he wanted to be Cole Pffeifer and not Theodore Bagwell, he is about to kill the man when Rita tells him not to, saying that he has a chance for a new life. So he lets Rita and Emily go and unties the man, only to be knocked unconscious, proving that the man was a Company agent. In the final third of the season, T-Bag is forced by The Company to work with Lincoln, Gretchen, and Self to get Scylla back by tracking down the buyer. The team is later joined by Mahone. When Gretchen is shot in a fire-fight with the buyer's underlings, T-Bag's character shows lingering hints of his softer side as he implores the others to spare Gretchen's life. Still holding onto his desire for legitimacy, however, T-Bag continues to work with the rest of the team in the next few episodes, but also spies on the rest of them, and in several episodes reports back to The Company's leader, General Krantz, with secret information that he has overheard. It is revealed in \\"VS\\" and \\"SOB\\" that T-Bag hopes to be rewarded for his efforts by becoming a fully fledged Company operative with his own office and desk. As the plot unfolds, he begins to grow back into his old ruthless persona. After the general arrives in Miami in \\"SOB\\", T-Bag starts working more directly with him and his minions. Attempting to impress the general and give him leverage against Michael, T-Bag tracks down Michael's girlfriend Sara Tancredi and holds her captive in \\"Cowboys and Indians\\". Still bent on revenge on Michael, T-Bag decides to rape Sara in \\"Rate of Exchange\\", but is knocked unconscious by Michael, who rescues Sara. After Michael hands over Scylla to Paul Kellerman, he gives them the option of letting T-Bag be exonerated with the rest of them or not. In the end, Sara, Michael, Lincoln, Sucre, Mahone and C-Note vote to have him taken back to prison. In the character's final appearance in the series epilogue of the series finale, set 4 years after the main events of the show, T-Bag is revealed to be back at Fox River. He is seen overhearing an inmate speaking of the captivity of negativity (a term used by GATE). He sees the inmate was reading a book from GATE and he warns the inmate, telling him he does not ever want to see that book again and the inmate replies, referring to T-Bag as sir. He is last seen whistling to a boy to hold his pocket. T-Bag looks up at the sky, once again the king of prison. He is the only member of the Fox River Eight to be in prison when the series ended. =The Final Break= During the movie Prison Break: The Final Break, it shows T-Bag was taken back to jail, in a neighboring prison to Sara. In the prison T-Bag continues to help the General, even though the General claims poverty when asked to pay for contraband T-Bag gets him. The General contacts Gretchen and offers her $100,000 to kill Sara. Michael comes up with a plan to parachute into the prison and rescue Sara. Lincoln offers T-Bag $5,000 to light a fire and set off the fire alarm at 7:00pm the night of the escape. T-Bag demands $100,000, and suggests they can get it by robbing the General of the money he has to pay the bounty on Sara. T-Bag did this to settle grudges with the General, including the General's refusal to pay T-Bag for favors in jail. T-Bag provides Lincoln with the name and phone number of Joe Daniels, (Richmond Arquette) the General's agent. Lincoln agrees to steal the money and put it in T-Bag's account by 7:00. Lincoln and Sucre then steal the $100,000 from Daniels. When T-Bag finds out that the transfer did not take place by 7:00 as promised, he angrily reveals the plot to the warden, and tells her that he was instructed to set off the fire alarm. Special Agent Wheatley responds by demanding the fire alarm and other systems that would cover other noises be turned off. This turned out to be part of Michael's plan knowing T-Bag would talk to the warden. Due to aiding in Sara's escape, T-Bag is put into solitary confinement. =Breakout Kings= In the Breakout Kings episode \\"The Bag Man\\", T-Bag again breaks out of prison to get revenge on the orderlies who wronged his mother. He escapes by stabbing a guard to death with his prosthetic hand, which he has sharpened to a point, while being escorted to the hospital for a replacement. T-Bag is eventually caught and briefly interviewed by Dr. Lloyd Lowery, who wants to find some clue as to the reasoning behind T-Bag's actions. Lloyd concludes the interview by saying, \\"Some machines come out of the factory broken. You're a broken machine.\\" Once he is left alone in the interrogation room, Bagwell quietly agrees. =Season 5= T-Bag returns in the revival season, set seven years after the events of The Final Break. He begins the season still incarcerated at Fox River, but is soon released due to an unknown benefactor. While receiving his possessions back, he receives an envelope that contains a picture of Michael, apparently alive in Ogygia Prison in Yemen. T-Bag contacts Lincoln in Chicago, where he reveals the photo. Lincoln understandably doesn't trust T-Bag, but keeps the photo nonetheless. T-Bag is soon contacted by a doctor who offers him a procedure that would equip him with a robotic hand. T-Bag is skeptical at first, but agrees to undergo the process. After the procedure, he threatens the doctor and demands to know who set it up, and the doctor reveals a man known only as \\"Outis\\", Michael's alias in Yemen. After a one episode absence, T-Bag returns in \\"The Liar\\". He tracks down Sara and he reveals he knows about Michael's activities as Kaniel Outis. He warns Sara of mercenaries tracking her, though Sara rebuffs him. After escaping the mercenaries' attempt on her life, she learns her phone was hacked via her own fingerprint, and suspects Paul Kellerman. Sara contacts T-Bag and asks him to set up a meeting with Kellerman to find out what he knows, to which T-Bag accepts. Bagwell tracks Kellerman to his home and holds him at gunpoint, believing him to be the villainous Poseidon, a rogue CIA operative who is looking to do away with Michael for good and sent his agents after Sara. Kellerman explains he is not Poseidon, but was looking into his operation, known as 21 Void. Before he can finish explaining, Kellerman is killed by Poseidon's mercenaries Van Gough and A&W;, but T-Bag escapes. He later tracks the mercenaries to Virginia in Kellerman's car, where he witnesses them meeting with Jacob, Sara's new husband. T-Bag relays this information to Sara. After a three episode absence, T-Bag returns in the penultimate episode of the season, reading a letter from Michael that concludes with a warning that in exchange for his freedom, T-Bag \\"must take a life.\\" T-Bag drives to Lake Michigan, where he leaves a remorseful message to God on his phone. He then confronts David \\"Whip\\" Martin, Michael's right-hand man during his CIA exploits, and reveals that though he thought himself infertile, Michael discovered that he is Whip's father. In the season finale, Michael reveals he contacted T-Bag as he knew Poseidon, revealed to be Jacob, wouldn't monitor their communications due to Michael's hatred for T-Bag. Michael tells T-Bag he wants him to kill Jacob to ensure everyone can get a happy life even though it means T-Bag will go back to prison. Despite David's objections, T-Bag consents, feeling that some people need to die. T-Bag aids Michael in his plan to frame Jacob, but it goes awry when A&W; kills David. An enraged T-Bag snaps A&W;'s neck and is sent back to Fox River for her murder. There, thanks to Michael, he ends up with Jacob as his cellmate. As the Fox River inmates cheer him on, T-Bag brutally assaults Jacob. Characteristics Robert KnepperDespite being despised by the other convicts for his heinous crimes and affiliation with the Alliance for Purity, T-Bag is quite eloquent and many women find him charismatic and charming. Knepper comments that, \\"T-Bag's not crazy. He knows exactly what he's doing. He's not going to make himself stupid.\\"Ryan, M, \\"Robert Knepper: The bad boy gets the best lines.\\" Chicago Tribune. March 16, 2006. Retrieved on March 2, 2007. In a separate interview, Knepper says, \\"I never play him like a stereotypical racist or redneck.

He likens the character to \\"Truman Capote without a degree.\\"Jensen, J, \\"Pro Cons: Theodore 'T-Bag' Bagwell.\\" Entertainment Weekly. March 16, 2006. Retrieved on March 2, 2007. As an adult, T-Bag starts committing more serious crimes, such as battery, assault, attempted murder, murder, rape, and kidnapping. It is also insinuated that he is a pedophile, and it is implied once in passing that he is also a necrophiliac. The character's sexual appetite ranges from in general, young men and women, adolescents, and children. The character once seduced a transgender woman within the prison at the behest of Sucre so as to obtain a pair of female undergarments necessary for a ruse; yet previously mocked the individual, stating 'I may be social, but that's the boundary line even I won't cross.' When asked about the character's sexuality, Knepper stated, \\"We're not passing judgment. We're not trying to get these people off the hook. T-Bag's not a homosexual. He's a raw animal. He'd [sleep with] anything.\\" Knepper said of fans of the series, \\"Around episode 6 or 7, I got so many letters from people saying, 'When I first started watching this show, I absolutely hated you and I wanted you dead. Now I still want you dead, but I'm starting to feel for you.' I think there's something in my eyes, a childlike thing in there. There's still an innocence. There's still a bit of hope.\\"\\"Criminal Minds.\\" Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved on March 2, 2007. During season four T-Bag starts showing disillusionment with his actions, even saying that he wishes that he could have been Cole Pfeiffer, respected salesman and person. He shows reluctance to undertake disturbing tasks. He shows emotion and is upset after receiving the news of Bellick's death. He does not want to take GATE hostage and reacts emotionally when Gretchen kills Gregory White, his employer and only true friend. He demonstrated authentic reluctance to kill Gretchen's family or the Bible Salesman/Company Agent. He eventually offers to even release him, at great risk to his personal freedom and lets Gretchen's family go. In the fall finale, T-Bag is the main party against Lincoln killing Gretchen, citing her being a mother as a reason, which can be seen as significant as she had tried to kill him not more than a few days earlier. During press for the revival season, Knepper himself stated that he doesn't like talking about the heinous crimes for which T-Bag was initially imprisoned. E!. Retrieved on June 25, 2017.

He was commonly called Son Brimmer, a nickname from his grandmother Annie Brimmer (son is short for grandson). The name apparently stuck when other members of the band noticed that the sun bothered him and he used the brim of a hat to shade his eyes. Early life Shade was born in February 1898 in Memphis, Tennessee, to William Shade and Mary ( Brimmer). Mary was fourteen years old when he was born. After her husband's death from a gunshot wound in 1903, she married a member of the Banks family, but by 1920 she was a widow once again. Shade had two half brothers, Henry Banks and Robert Banks. He credited his mother with teaching him how to play the harmonica, his first instrument. Biography Shade first heard jug band music in 1925, recorded by the Dixieland Jug Blowers, from Louisville, Kentucky. He was excited by what he heard and felt that bringing this style of music to his hometown of Memphis could be promising. He persuaded a few local musicians, though still reluctant, to join him in creating one of the first jug bands in Memphis. The original Memphis Jug Band consisted of Shade and three others: Lionhouse, whom Shade converted from a whiskey bottle blower to a jug blower; Tee Wee Blackman on guitar; and Ben Ramey on kazoo. Shade played the guitar, the \\"bullfiddle\\" (washtub bass), and the harmonica, the instrument on which he was most influential. His pure country blues harmonica style served as the foundation for later renowned harmonicists like Big Walter Horton, Sonny Boy Williamson I and Sonny Boy Williamson II; Charlie Musselwhite credits him as a mentor. He composed many of the band's songs and sang lead vocal on a handful of their recordings. His distinctive guitar style has also been identified as that of the uncredited accompanist who backed the Sanctified Church gospel singer Bessie Johnson on record. The Memphis Jug Band had a fluid membership during the nearly 40 years that it was active, recording under a number of names and in various styles ranging from blues and rags to gospel. All the while, Shade was the backbone of the group, as he was the one responsible for finding new members to keep the band going. The group performed a mixture of traditional and original material. Shade tried, whenever possible, to copyright his music under his name. Besides being the band's musical leader, he was also in charge of their business affairs, planning concerts and distributing income. At the band's peak, Shade worked on a weekly retainer with Victor Records and was able to buy a house with his wife, the singer Jennie Mae Clayton, and $3000 worth of stock in Victor. He lost both the stock and the house shortly after the Great Depression began in 1929.Charters, Samuel (1991). The Blues Makers. Da Capo Press. Part II, p. 22. . The band's visibility declined in the mid-1930s as a result of the overall decline in commercial recordings, a shift in musical taste toward more urbane swing music, and violence occurring in Memphis. Blues revivalists found Shade and his old partners still playing together into the early 1960s and released several field recordings under the name of the Memphis Jug Band. The band during this period usually included Shade's long-time friend Charlie Burse, whom he had hired in 1928 as a vocalist and tenor guitarist, and sometimes included his old rival Gus Cannon. Shade also performed as an accompanist on Cannon's \\"comeback\\" album, Walk Right In, recorded by Stax Records in 1963. Shade's gravestone, Memphis, 2008 Shade died of pneumonia, at John Gaston Hospital, in Memphis, in 1966, aged 68, and was buried in Shelby County Cemetery. The fact that this is a public cemetery and full of unmarked graves, reveals Shade's poverty in his later years. In 2008 a group of musicians based at the Old Town School of Folk Music held a fundraiser and purchased a headstone for his grave. The same group sponsored a \\"brass note\\" on the Beale Street walk of fame, dedicated on August 1, 2009. Shade's band was the first jug band to receive this honor. Discography The Memphis Jug Band recorded nearly 100 sides between 1927 and 1934, making it the most recorded of the pre-war jug bands. In the first four of these years, it recorded at least 60 songs for Victor Records. Over time, the band's style moved to a jazzier beat, as evidenced by its final recordings, in 1934. Famous singles by the band include \\"Lindberg Hop\\", \\"On the Road Again\\", \\"Newport News Blues\\", \\"K.C. Moan\\", and \\"Stealin' Stealin'\\".

It was published in 2001 by Golden Gryphon Press. The story concerns a race of extraterrestrials who land on Earth in order to genetically engineer humanity to be their pets. Plot overview The Lindauzi - a bearlike alien species bred to bond empathically with another species - find themselves adrift when their symbiont species, the Iani, are wiped out by a plague. Seeking another species with which to bond, the Lindauzi settle on Earth, domesticating and breeding humankind to fill the void left by the Iani. With their culture coming apart at the seams, and extinction from feral reversion threatening their species, the Lindauzi believe they have finally found success and salvation in Ilox, a human boy with great emotional sensitivity. As Ilox's bond with his Lindauzi bond-mate Phlarx grows, however, so does his curiosity regarding the history of humanity, and the answers he seeks lead to his expulsion from, and the downfall of, Lindauzi society. Plot summary The novel switches among several different timelines which ultimately tie together in the last few chapters. As the novel opens, the Lindauzi are reeling from the extinction of their soul-mate species, the Iani, without whom they will lose all sense of themselves and succumb to \\"reversion,\\" a return to a feral, animal state. Many Lindauzi are choosing suicide over the possibility of reversion; a civil war has erupted between those who believe it is time for the Lindauzi to surrender to extinction, and those who wish to leave the homeworld in search of a compatible species to replicate the bond the Lindauzi had enjoyed with the Iani. Corviax, son of the Left Emperor, finally wins the right to lead a search expedition; they discover that the humans of Earth share many similarities to the Iani and, believing that the Iani emotional bond with the Lindauzi can be recreated in the humans, Corviax instigates an ambitious scheme to make the human population more receptive to the Lindauzi. He begins by covertly releasing viruses to thin the planet's population, and his fleet endears itself to the sick and traumatized survivors by arriving with a cure for the virus, seemingly by pure coincidence. Once a bond of trust has been established, the Lindauzi begin building settlements and inviting humans to live with them. Further dependence is fostered in the humans by the systematic decimation of the humans' companion animals, such as dogs and cats, by more viruses. Within three or four generations, humanity is completely dependent upon and subservient to the Lindauzi, who have begun their breeding program in earnest. Ilox is the pinnacle of the breeding program, an exceptionally bright and empathic human boy who at an early age can sense the presence and emotions of nearby Lindauzi. He becomes the pet of Phlarx, a young Lindauzi noble, and the two form a deep bond - \\"heart to heart, mind to mind, soul to soul,\\" as is the stated goal of the breeding program. Despite his attachment to Phlarx, Ilox is insatiably curious, especially about human history. \\"Dogs\\" - as humans are now called by the Lindauzi - are forbidden from acquiring this knowledge, but Ilox eventually learns of the origins of the Lindauzi, the extinction of the Iani, and the lengths to which the Lindauzi went to engineer humanity to their specifications. At the same time he comes by this knowledge, Ilox falls in love with another pet human, Nivere, and is caught having sex with her. Nivere is euthanized, and Ilox - formerly seen as the Lindauzi hope for a new partner species - is now thought to be a failed breeding experiment of no use to the Lindauzi. He is separated from Phlarx and abandoned in the wild to fend for himself or die; his disappearance is written off as an accidental death. Ilox is taken in by a small tribe of \\"wolves\\" - humans who have resisted domestication by the Lindauzi and live apart from them, hiding in the ruins of human cities. Ilox eventually adapts to life among the free humans in the settlement of Jackson, and takes a wife, Mary, with whom he has two sons, Caleb and Davy. Despite his new life as a \\"wolf,\\" Ilox misses Phlarx dearly, and one day when Caleb is eleven, Ilox leaves the human settlement to return to his Lindauzi bondmate. Not long after this, the settlement falls under siege by Lindauzi \\"hounds,\\" humans bred to hunt and kill \\"wolves.\\" Caleb, the only survivor of the raid, wanders on his own for a time until he is discovered and brought before Prince Orfassian, son of the late Corviax. Orfassian, impressed with the fact that Caleb can speak (and specifically, curse) in the Lindauzi language, decides to keep Caleb as a novelty, and has him trained as a \\"show dog.\\" Ilox, meanwhile, has been reunited with Phlarx and tries to tell him about the indignities humanity has suffered to become the pets of the Lindauzi. He tries to explain that the symbiotic bond that existed between the Iani and the Lindauzi can never be recreated as long as humanity remains subservient to the Lindauzi, and that humans cannot be forced into loving another being, but must be allowed the choice of loving, as Ilox chose to love his wife Mary. Phlarx cannot comprehend this, however, and thinking that Ilox has been corrupted by living among wolves, has him sealed in a sensory deprivation cocoon in an attempt to correct what Phlarx sees as a flaw in Ilox's otherwise impeccable breeding. This only has the effect of driving Ilox insane, however, and while Ilox is now more dependent upon Phlarx than ever before, he is a far cry from the intelligent, capable companion Phlarx desired. Caleb is eventually reunited with his father, who no longer recognizes him, and the pair escape from the Lindauzi city of Umium - built on the ruins of New York City - via the old city's subway system. They are intercepted by Phlarx, who is on the run from Lindauzi authorities for displaying signs of reversion and is suffering from severe guilt for what he has done to Ilox. Phlarx agrees to take Caleb and Ilox to the \\"Summer Country\\" - South America - where it is too warm for Lindauzi to settle and humans live with relatively little interference. Prince Orfassian, upon hearing of Phlarx's supposed reversion, the escape of Ilox and Caleb, and the truth behind Ilox's supposed \\"death\\" years previously, finally realizes that the bond cannot exist in humans the way it did in the Iani, and that the Lindauzi are facing inevitable reversion and extinction. He arranges for the air filters in the forcefields surrounding the Lindauzi cities to be altered so that carbon monoxide emissions will slowly reach lethal levels, leading to a peaceful and dignified death for his species. Caleb adapts well to life among the human population of the Summer Country, and Ilox slowly begins regaining his senses, though he never recovers them completely. He has recurring prophetic dreams about the death of all the Lindauzi, which the humans of the Summer Country decide to act on, making tentative exploratory forays beyond their safe haven in the tropics. Phlarx does not fare as well as the humans, however; he suffers in the tropical heat, and this, combined with his compromised bond with Ilox, leads to his death within a few months. Ilox dies along with him, and the pair are buried side by side - Ilox on the boundary of the sanctified ground of the village cemetery, and Phlarx just beyond it. Species *Lindauzi: masc. Lindauzu, fem. Lindauza. A genetically engineered, sapient species who require an empathic bond with another compatible species to survive; left unbonded, they will eventually succumb to a total loss of sentience, known as reversion. This is apparently regarded as a fate worse than death, as many Lindauzi chose suicide over possible reversion after the extinction of the Iani. Lindauzi are described as resembling a cross between a bear and a panther; they stand upright, between roughly seven and ten feet tall, and are covered with thick, shaggy fur that is said to have an unpleasant smell when wet. They have retractable claws and fangs and crests of fur on their heads which raise and lower according to mood. Lindauzi are highly intelligent and technologically advanced; they mature much more slowly than humans and seem to have longer lifespans, as well. *Iani: the starfaring humanoid race responsible for genetically engineering the Lindauzi and granting them sapience, creating a partner race. They are described as being very thin and long-fingered, taller than humans, but less so than Lindauzi. The species was completely wiped out by disease, with the last few dying off approximately two generations before Corviax initiated the search for their replacements. They are referred to as the \\"star-cousins\\" of the human race, and it is alluded that they once visited Earth, as Corviax gleaned our planet's location from historic navigational charts. Main characters *Ilox: a human bred and raised by the Lindauzi. He is very tall, fair-haired and pale-skinned; he has exceptional empathic abilities, and is capable of sensing the approach of Lindauzi from a considerable distance. He forms an instant and intense bond with Phlarx, the Lindauzi youngling to whom he is given as a pet. *Phlarx: Ilox's owner, a member of a Lindauzi noble family. Blond-furred, he is rather lackadaisical and careless, and a bit simpleminded. He loves Ilox deeply, but seems to believe that Ilox's love for him is somehow compromised if Ilox has love for anyone else, including Ilox's wife Mary and sons Davy and Caleb. Grows to develop a general empathy of his own for all humans, not just Ilox, as he says he can feel the hatred the humans of the Summer Country feel towards him. Lived in mortal fear of his father Morix for much of his childhood; as an adult, took over management of his father's tobacco plantation, and was engaged to be mated to Xian, a political marriage that would tie his line to the royal family. *Caleb: Ilox's son; he is dark-haired and -complected, but shares his father's incredible empathy. He can sense the thoughts and emotions of nonsentient animals, such as domestic dogs and mice; see the emotional \\"auras\\" of other humans; and sense the feelings of Lindauzi. Learned to speak Lindauzi from his father, a skill that ultimately saved his life after the destruction of his hometown of Jackson in a Lindauzi pogrom. Along with his brother, was disliked by most of the other residents of Jackson due to his heritage, as free humans distrust Lindauzi-bred pets. Under the ownership of Prince Orfassian, became a \\"performing animal,\\" competing in shows and sporting events. *Morix: Phlarx's father. Blond-furred like his son, he is harsh, gruff and largely unloving. Ran a tobacco plantation and had a reputation as a breeder of high-quality dogs. His bondmate was Sandron, Ilox's sire, who died at a young age, leaving Morix bereft. Was prone to vicious outbursts of temper, a trait he passed on to Phlarx. Killed himself after Prince Orfassian learned the truth about Ilox's supposed death. *Mary: Caleb's mother, wife of Ilox. Was one of few Jacksoners able to read, a skill she imparted to Caleb. Discovered Ilox in the snow after his banishment from the Lindauzi plantation and taught him how to live among free humans. Had one stillborn child before Caleb; died giving birth to Davy. *Davy: Caleb's four- year-old brother; died in the Lindauzi raid on Jackson. *Aunt Sara: Mary's sister, charged with taking care of Caleb and Davy after Mary died and Ilox left Jackson; had a particularly intense dislike for Ilox and Caleb, on whom she freely took out her aggressions. Died in the Lindauzi raid on Jackson. *Chlavash: a red-furred Lindauzi breeder in the direct employ of Prince Orfassian, personally charged with training Caleb for participation in shows and athletic events. Among the Lindauzi who opted not to take a human bondmate, he displayed surprising compassion and affection; this was largely directed only at Caleb, though, whom he still seemed to regard only as a valuable and treasured pet rather than as an equal. *Corviax: former Crown Prince of Lindauzian, son of Left Emperor Orfassian, leader of the search fleet that discovered Earth and instigator of chain of events that led to the Lindauzi domestication of humankind. Was quite ruthless in concealing the extent of his species' involvement in the plague that decimated humanity. Died when Ilox was thirteen, at the age of about 120 years. *Crown Prince Orfassian: son of Corviax; described as being fond of strange and novel things. Seemed to have a bit of a temper. Was the first Lindauzi to truly realize and accept that his species was headed for extinction and organized a dignified death via carbon monoxide poisoning, rather than let the Lindauzi race revert and become wild animals. *Tyiul: Phlarx's older sister; seemed to have some genuine care and affection for her brother. *Nivere: Tyiul's companion pet, a girl two years older than Ilox. As she and Ilox grow into adolescence they become attracted to one another and enter into a sexual relationship; additionally, she becomes Ilox's confidant as he shares with her the knowledge he gleaned about human history. When their relationship is discovered, Nivere is put to death. *Ossit: mother of Phlarx and Tyiul, mate of Morix. As is the case with most Lindauzi, her marriage was politically motivated and - like her relationships with her children - devoid of any real affection. One of few Lindauzi who still had memories of the homeworld; opted never to take a human pet and regarded them with open distaste. Committed suicide not long after Phlarx was gifted with Ilox.

The station is located near the township of Dora Creek, on the western shore of Lake Macquarie, New South Wales, Australia and is owned and operated by Origin Energy. It is Australia's largest power station. The plant has two smokestacks rising 200 m (656 ft) in height.https://www.emporis.com/buildings/1249922/chimneys-of-eraring-power- station-newcastle-australia  History and facilities Eraring Power Station view from carpark Construction of the power station began in 1977. The first turbo-alternator was brought online in 1982, with the second and third in 1983, and the fourth in 1984. The generating capacity of each of the four turbines was upgraded from 660 MW to 720 MW between 2011 and 2012. The process of upgrading the control room to a fully digital system was completed in 2005. Salt water from Lake Macquarie is used for cooling and is supplied through a concrete tunnel which passes under Dora Creek and up to the station via open canal. Reclaimed sewage water from the Dora Creek Waste Water Treatment Works is heavily purified and used to generate steam for the turbines as opposed to using municipal potable water supplies. The salt water helps in the cooling of the superheated steam as well as moderation of the temperature of outlet water to minimise thermal pollution. The coal comes from five mines in the local area, delivered by conveyor, rail and private road. There is significant coal storage capacity on site. Eraring power station employs the Fabric Filter system of dust collection, in which particulate emissions resulting from coal combustion are captured as opposed to being released into the atmosphere. Some of this material is stored in an area nearby while some is taken and used as a component of road base. From 2009 to 2013 the Eraring power station has been equipped with Dry Bottom Ash Handling Systems (the MAC - Magaldi Ash Cooler) at all four units. Electricity generated at the station is transmitted through high voltage transmission lines. Turbines 1 and 2 are connected to a 330kV transmission line while turbines 3 and 4 are connected to a 500kV transmission line. =Fire= At 2.16 am on Friday 28 October 2011 unit 2B generator transformer exploded with the transformer oil catching fire. The oil fire burnt for approximately two days and the estimated repair cost was 20 million. Fire and Rescue NSW, assisted by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service controlled the initial incident with subsequent investigations by NSW Police, the Office of Environment & Heritage, and Workcover NSW.  Pollution  As of 2017, The power station has had allegations made against it, regarding the exceedance of NSW air pollution standards. The EPA reported Mercury emissions of 1.3kg, and has begun investigating the alleged under reporting of self collected emission data.

The station was located near Doyalson, on the shores of Lake Munmorah, New South Wales, Australia and was owned and operated by Delta Electricity, a company owned by the New South Wales Government. In July 2012 the coal-fired generators were permanently retired from service. However, the nearby gas-fired Colongra power station, which was commissioned in 2009, remains in operation. History and facilities The station was constructed with 4 English Electric 350 MW turbo-alternators. Munmorah had a total capacity of 1,400 MW. Steam was supplied at a pressure of 2,500 psi and a temperature of 460 ¬∞C. One unit was completed in 1967, another in 1968, and the remaining two in 1969. Units 3 and 4 had fabric filters fitted in the 1980s, and this reduced load to 320 MW each. Units 1 and 2 were relegated to emergency use from 1992. Munmorah drew salt water from Lake Munmorah, part of the Tuggerah Lakes, for condenser cooling. The coal for Munmorah came from two underground mines, Munmorah State mine and Newvale No.2 Colliery, and also from Vales Point coal storage via a series of conveyor belts. In September 2007, the New South Wales State Government announced the commencement of a trial of 'clean coal' technology at Munmorah Power Station. The 5 million trial by the CSIRO and Delta Electricity was part of a larger A$150 million trial jointly funded by the coal companies. On 15 November 2007, 15 Greenpeace activists entered the power station property and switched off one of the conveyor belts as a protest against the climate change policies of the Liberal Party of Australia and Australian Labor Party in the run up to the 2007 federal election. In 2012 Carbon Monitoring for Action estimated the power station emitted 4.246 million tonnes of greenhouse gases as a result of burning coal. Closure Delta Electricity announced on 3 July 2012 the closure of Munmorah power station after 45 years of operation due to decreasing energy demand. Parts of the boilers and turbines needed to be replaced which would have cost about 400 million dollars. Units 3 and 4 had been maintained on standby but have not been in production since August 2010. Munmorah was disconnected from the grid in May 2014 and completely de- commissioned. Plans were made to demolish the station and its out-buildings and sell off the 500 acres of surrounding land for housing and sporting venues. Demolition started in 2016 and was completed by the end of 2018. In December 2015 a survey of the power station precinct found that pollutants(diesel) had entered the water table and made some areas unsuitable for housing. In 2017, the time came to implode the twin chimney stacks at a height of 155m tall, both two stacks toppled over. It was a controlled demolition project. Demolition of the boilers occurred in May 2017 and 2018. Chimney Stacks *2 Emission Stacks at a height of 155 metres tall. Demolition In 2013 was the beginning for demolition to begin on Munmorah Power Station facilities, the first move was to pull away parts from the boilers. That included some facilities inside the boilers and the vents that went to the emission stacks from the boiler facility. In 2015, was time to disconnect all vintage equipment from the large shed and boiler and send them off to the scrap heap. In 2017, the two Emission Stacks at 155 metres tall, came crashing down by a controlled demolition.

The sculpture won a competition organised by the Sibelius Society following the composer's death in 1957. Although her abstract sculpture of pipes is now well regarded as an important Finnish landmark, its initial reception was controversial. The objection centred on the abstract design; and although the design looked like stylised organ pipes, it was known that the composer had created little music for organs. To address her critics' concern, she was required to add Sibelius's face beside the main sculpture.

The Queen's Tower, showing Lions at base Plaque on the ground floor of the Tower A view from the top of the Queen's Tower The Queen's Tower is situated in the South Kensington Campus of Imperial College London, England, just to the north of Imperial College Road. It is 87 metres (287ft) tall with a copper-covered dome at its top. To reach the base of the dome from the ground on foot, one must ascend a series of narrow spiral staircases, comprising 325 steps in total. The tower used to be the central tower of the Imperial Institute, and is now the sole remaining part of that building. History The Imperial Institute was founded on Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887, and its partial demolition began in 1957. At that time it was generally known as the Collcutt Tower, after its designer, the Victorian architect Thomas Edward Collcutt. The tower itself would have been demolished along with the rest of the Institute, had it not been for a public campaign led by the then Poet Laureate John Betjeman, a supporter of 19th-century architecture. He warned that tastes in architecture change, and that the destruction of this building (at a time when Victorian architecture had fallen out of favour) would be a loss.Expansion of Imperial College: Campaign against demolition . Accessed 16 December 2010. Restoration In 1966, with the rest of the building demolished, the tower was repaired to enable it to stand on its own, which involved the construction of new foundations. There are also two stone lions at the foot of the tower, which were once set at the entrance to the Imperial Institute. These two stone lions are pair of a set of four, the other two (which are not in such good condition) are in the grounds of the Commonwealth Institute.

Founded in 1976 as a flower grower, it became a joint stock company in 1989, with 100 percent ownership held by founder Ivica Todoriƒá. It greatly expanded its operations in the following 25 years by acquiring a number of large companies in Croatia and Southeast Europe. The Agrokor group had an annual sales revenue of ‚Ç¨6.465 billion in 2015, which made it the second largest retail and eleventh largest overall company in all of Southeast Europe. As of 31 December 2017, Agrokor employed around 50,900 people. On 1 April 2019, the assets of the demised Agrokor were consolidated within the newly founded Fortenova Group. Within Agrokor, whose primary activity was production and distribution of food and beverages and retail trade, among others, there were also the largest Croatian producer of mineral and spring water Jamnica, ice cream company Ledo, oil, margarine and mayonnaise production company Zvijezda, the largest Croatian meat production company PIK Vrbovec, agricultural-industrial company Belje, the largest Croatian retailer Konzum, and the largest Croatian retail newsstand chain Tisak. Ivica Todoriƒá, founder of Agrokor, served as companies' CEO until April 2017. When Agrokor's financial difficulties became untenable, in March 2017 the government of Croatia hastily drafted and passed the Law on Extraordinary Administration Procedure in Enterprises of Systematic Importance for the Republic of Croatia, and by Todoriƒá's activation of the Law in early April 2017 the Government forestalled the bankruptcy procedure and effectively took control over the company. Special administrator Ante Ramljak was appointed by the Commercial Court on 10 April 2017. Nevertheless, Ivica Todoriƒá remained a nominal owner of Agrokor. Ministry of Economy, Entrepreneurship and Crafts published on its web site the Monthly Report on Economic and Financial Situation and the Implementation of Agrokor's Extraordinary Administration Measures for the period between 10 April to 10 May 2017, written by commissioner Ramljak, in which it was revealed that Agrokor didn't have a business plan for 2017 and was in a crisis of management. On 17 October 2017, the Croatian State Attorney Office launched a criminal prosecution against 13 members of the former governing and supervisory boards, including owner Ivica Todoriƒá himself, on suspicions of abuse of power in economic business, forgery of official documents and breach of trade and business bookkeeping obligations. Ivica Todoriƒá was reportedly residing in London, pending arrest and extradition. On 28 February 2018, Fabris Peru≈°ko was appointed as new Extraordinary Commissioner. More than 80% of Agrokor creditors voted in favor of the Settlement plan on 4 July 2018. Settlement was implemented on 1 April 2019 and business operations and assets were transferred to a new holding company according to the Settlement plan.http://www.agrokor.hr/en/news/fortenova-group-begins-its-business- operations-today/ Agrokor d.d. continues to be under Extraordinary Administration until all legal steps defined by the Settlement plan are fulfilled.

By 1977, business was expanded by new programs: import and export of cereals, oil crops, fruit, and vegetables, with a significant increase in turnover and profits. The company soon become the leader in the flower industry. =1989‚Äì2003: Domestic expansion= In 1989, when the laws become more liberal, Todoriƒá founded the joint-stock company Agrokor.

This was followed by the start of construction work for a distribution center, which was also the largest investment project in the Group. In ƒåitluk (BiH), a new company for ice production named ƒåitluk Ledo was established in 2000. In the same year, Agrokor opened its largest distribution center in Croatia and the region. According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Agrokor had a credit worth of 170 million euros. Agrokor holds 97.4% of the shares of Sarajevski Kiseljak company. Ledo and Irida Daruvar agreed on a strategic cooperation in 2001 for the distribution and sale of frozen fish. Soon afterward, Konzum started with wholesale.

It also acquired 99.76% of PIK Vrbovec and 67.92% of Belje and opened the first drugstore called Kozmo. The product Jana received an EAUSCAR excellence award in the same year as natural spring water. In 2006, EBRD invested 110 million euros into the equity capital of Agrokor and thus gained 8.33% in the Group. In 2007, Agrokor bought Tisak, the largest retail newsstand chain in Croatia. Logistics and distribution center in Dugopolje opened in 2010. In the first three years, Agrokors' combined volume invests totaled 560 million kunas.

Agrokor's bonds started losing value. In February 2017, Moody's reduced the prospects for Agrokor's rating from stable to negative. In April 2017, the government passed a law, nicknamed Lex Agrokor, that allowed the government to appoint an executive with a special crisis management team to steer a restructuring of companies with more than 5,000 employees who were in financial troubles. More than a third of Agrokor's debt in early 2017 was said to be held by Russia's two biggest banks, including the state-owned Sberbank; the Russian ambassador to Croatia's public threat to Agrokor in February 2017 was seen by Croatian analysts as a sign that Agrokor's problems had a geopolitical dimension and were being instrumentalised by Russia to expand its influence and exert pressure.Tycoon‚Äôs Balkan Empire Unravels in 60 Days of Market Panic Bloomberg, 23 March 2017.Russia Looms Over Balkan Giant's Fight to Survive: QuickTake Q&A; Bloomberg, 23 March 2017.JESU LI RUSI ZNALI ZA CRNE PROGNOZE O AGROKORU?

On 28 February 2018, Fabris Peru≈°ko was appointed as new Extraordinary Commissioner. More than 80% of Agrokor creditors voted in favor of the Settlement plan at a hearing held on 4 July 2018. On 26 September 2019 in Cleveland, Fabris Peru≈°ko was presented with the Turnaround and Transaction Award (TMA) for the financial restructuring of Agrokor, proclaimed by the industry in the USA to be the most significant international procedure of its kind in the world in the 'international transaction of the year' category and one of the world's 12 most significant international restructuring procedures in 2018. The Extraordinary Administration Procedure was recognized as an insolvency procedure in England and Wales in November 2017, in Switzerland in February 2018 and in the US, pursuant to Chapter 15, in November 2018. By Regulation of the European Parliament and Council, in July 2018 the Extraordinary Administration Procedure Act was enlisted among the acts recognized as insolvency procedures on the entire EU territory. Settlement was implemented on 1 April 2019 and business operations and assets were transferred to a new holding company, Fortenova Group, according to the Settlement plan. Acquisitions Agrokor's core businesses are the production and distribution of food and drinks and retail, and over the years the group acquired several large Croatian companies in those sectors: * Jamnica ‚Äì the largest water bottling company in Croatia, established in the 1830s and acquired by Agrokor in 1992. * Zvijezda ‚Äì the largest cooking oil and margarine factory in the country, established in 1916 by Samuel David Alexander and acquired in 1993. * Konzum ‚Äì the largest supermarket chain in the country which operates over 600 stores in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Founded as \\"Unikonzum\\" in 1957, the company was acquired by Agrokor in 1994 * Ledo ‚Äì the largest ice cream and frozen food manufacturer in Croatia, established in 1976 and acquired in 1994. * PIK Vrbovec ‚Äì the largest meat manufacturer in the country, acquired in 2005. * Belje ‚Äì the largest agricultural company in the country, acquired in 2005. * Agrolaguna ‚Äì winemaking, olive growing, and cattle farming company acquired in 2005. * Tisak ‚Äì the largest chain of newsstands in the country and the biggest retailer of newspapers and tobacco products.

Several of Agrokor's Croatian subsidiaries are listed on the Zagreb Stock Exchange (ZSE) and Ledo is included in its official share index CROBEX as of September 2010. For approaching international capital markets, Agrokor had to receive a rating by a rating agency as this is a must to give potential investors a benchmark. Without the ratings of Standard & Poor's and Moody's, Agrokor could not have issued two major bonds (one at the end of 2009 about 400 million, one in 2011 about 150 million).Video of Hrvoje Habus, Director for Strategy and Capital Markets, Agrokor d.d. October 2011 In April 2012, Standard & Poor's also revised the outlook on Agrokor's ‚ÄòB‚Äô rating to positive from stable. Agrokor had to be considered by the Croatian market regulator Croatian Competition Agency (, AZTN) for some of its acquisitions. It requested approval of acquisition of Mercator where Agrokor will have to shut down some retail locations in Croatia. In June 2014, Agrokor finalized the acquisition of an 80.75% stake in Mercator, which is the biggest retail chain in Slovenia, and throughout the Balkans, with over 2000 retail stores. On 27 June 2014, Agrokor acquired the majority stake of Poslovni sistem Mercator and became its majority owner.

It was designed by Gregotti Associati International. Completed in January 2012, it is used mostly for football matches with the capability of hosting Olympic Games. It is home to Kawkab Marrakesh football team. The stadium has a capacity of 45,240 people. It replaces Stade Al Harti as the home of Kawkab Marrakech and as the main stadium of the city. It hosted the 2014 IAAF Continental Cup, four games including the final in the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, and the 2014 African Championships in Athletics. History =Construction= Launched on September, 2003, the construction of the stadium lasted 7 years and 3 months. Inauguration took place on January 5, 2011 with friendlies involving two Moroccan teams ; Kawkab Marrakech and Wydad Casablanca facing two French teams ; Olympique Lyonnais and Paris Saint Germain. =Criticism= After more than seven years in construction, the Marrakchis people and the contributors unveiled the first stadium in the world to be both rectangular and host a running track. The criticism from that branched from these constructive decisions is that the distance from the running track to the bleachers is much too far. Considered a fault to the builders, the space contrast is attributed to a lack of potential spectators in the stadium, who avoid the stadium due to poor vision. =Means of access= The stadium is located north of Marrakesh. It is served by the international airport Marrakesh - Menara at fourteen kilometers, and the railway station of the city. Access to the stadium is provided by sixteen doors and a grand entrance.

High school/college  Birkins attended El Camino Real high school in Woodland Hills, California. He played baseball for the Conquistadors and helped them win back-to-back LA City Championships in 1997 and 1998. He was named MVP of the 1998 championship game after throwing a 10 inning complete game, striking out 12, and hitting the go ahead 2-run double. Birkins pitched for the UCLA Bruins in 1999 and led the staff in ERA, but decided to step away after the season due to burn out. During his time away from school, he volunteered as an assistant coach for his alma mater. That June, Birkins was selected in the 33rd round (984th overall) by the Baltimore Orioles. El Camino Real's senior infielder Conor Jackson was drafted in the 31st round (936th overall) by the Cleveland Indians which meant a player and coach from the same high school were drafted on the same day. In the fall of 2000, Birkins enrolled at Los Angeles Pierce College and was rated by Baseball America as the #1 Junior College draft prospect in the country. Birkins signed with the Baltimore Orioles prior to the 2001 draft as they held his rights from the previous year as a \\"draft-and-follow\\" prospect. MLB career Birkins made his Major League debut on May 4, 2006 against the Texas Rangers throwing 2.1 scoreless innings in relief. He struck out Mark Texiera to record his first Major League strikeout. He picked up his first Major League victory on May 28, 2006 against the Anaheim Angels. Birkins retired all four batters he faced including two strikeouts. After the 2007 season, Birkins was claimed off waivers by the Tampa Bay Rays. He was a member of the 2008 Tampa Bay Rays which won the franchise's first American League pennant. He signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies in February 2009 and pitched for the AAA Colorado Springs SkySox in 2009 and 2010. After conclusion of the 2010 season, Birkins retired from professional baseball.

It has been amended several times. Baker River Watershed Floodwater Retarding Structure No.6 Under this Act, the Soil Conservation Service at the Department of Agriculture provides planning assistance and construction funding for projects constructed by local sponsors, often in the form of flood control districts. Restrictions on projects include: the size of the watershed must be 250,000 acres (1011 km¬≤) or less; no single structure may provide more than of flood water retention; no single dam may provide more than of total capacity; and projects with costs greater than $5 million or with structures with total capacities greater than must be approved by Congress. The original 1954 statute sought cooperation between the federal government and states and localities to prevent flood damage. The Secretary of Agriculture was authorized to construct flood protection measures below a certain volume limit. Such initiatives were to be cost-shared and localities were required to contribute rights-of-way. The law also required that the Secretary of the Interior be consulted regarding plans which affect reclamation, irrigation or public lands under the Secretary of the Interior. Related views were to be submitted with project plans to the Congress. Baker River Watershed Floodwater Retarding Structure No.6 Spillway Amendments enacted in 1956 imposed volume limits on projects authorized to be undertaken by the Secretary of Agriculture without Congressional approval. Projects for which the federal contribution was estimated to exceed $250,000 or which exceeded were to be submitted to the Secretary of the Interior for review if they involved reclamation or irrigation lands, or public lands or wildlife under the Secretary's jurisdiction. The views of the Department of the Interior were required to accompany the report to Congress and regulations to coordinate activities of the Department of Agriculture and Interior were mandated. In addition, loans to localities were authorized and the provisions of the Act were extended to apply to Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Amendments to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act in 1958 () also amended this statute to require the Secretary of Agriculture to notify the Secretary of the Interior regarding projects in order that the Secretary of the Interior could prepare a fish and wildlife report to be incorporated in project plans. \\"Full consideration\\" was to be given to such reports by the Secretary of Agriculture; however, the Secretary of Agriculture retained the discretion to adopt fish and wildlife recommendations which are \\"technically and economically feasible.\\" Costs for related surveys and reports are to be borne by the Secretary of the Interior. Amendments adopted later that year () added fish and wildlife development as an aspect of flood control projects to be constructed.

More recently, in May 1978 Four Oaks became the northern terminus of the newly inaugurated Cross-City Line from via Birmingham New Street, with trains running up to every 10 minutes in each direction. The line to the north towards Lichfield City had a less frequent service to begin with (Lichfield being outside the West Midlands PTE boundary), but the growing popularity of the route led to it gaining additional services by the mid-1980s. Eventually, the line was extended to Lichfield Trent Valley in November 1988. Electric operation at the station commenced in 1992 (as far as New Street), with the full line through to Redditch following suit in July 1993.

One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Labour 23 *Liberal Democrats 19 *Conservative 6 Background Before the election the Labour party needed to gain 1 seat to regain a majority on the council that they had lost at the last election in 2004. Labour had 24 seats before the election, while the Liberal Democrats had 18 and the Conservatives had 6. Labour was able to run the council however as the Conservative mayor had agreed not to use her casting vote. Among the councillors who were defending seats at the election was the Labour group leader Marie Rimmer in West Park ward, while the seat in Blackbrook was vacant after the death of Labour councillor Albert Smith earlier in 2006. 16 seats were up for election and as well as candidates from the three political parties who held seats on the council, there were also four candidates from the Community Action Party and one each from the British National Party and the Socialist Labour Party. Election result Labour remained the largest party on the council but lost one seat to the Liberal Democrats to leave the party with 23 councillors. The Liberal Democrat gain from Labour came in Town Centre ward and moved them to 19 seats on the council, however the Labour council leader Marie Rimmer held her seat in West Park with a 457-vote majority. Meanwhile, the Conservatives remained on 6 seats after holding the 2 seats they had been defending. Following the election Liberal Democrat Brian Spencer became the new leader of the council after an agreement between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, with the Liberal Democrats taking 5 of the seats on the cabinet and the Conservative group leader Wally Ashcroft taking the other seat. This came after Labour rejected proposals for all three parties to share power on the council and meant Labour lost power on the council after 70 years.

He was at times attributed with being capable of almost miraculous or mythical deeds in his designated capacity as a close friend and principal advisor of L√™ L·ª£i, Vietnam's hero- emperor, who fought to free the country from Chinese rule. He is credited with writing the important political statements of L√™ L·ª£i and inspiring the Vietnamese populace to support open rebellion against the Ming Dynasty rulers. He is also the author of \\"Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the Wu\\" (B√¨nh Ng√¥ ƒë·∫°i c√°o). Biography =Early life= Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i originally was from H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng Province, he was born in 1380 in ThƒÉng Long (present day Hanoi), the capital of the declining Tr·∫ßn Dynasty.Renowned Vietnamese Intellectuals, p.48 ff. Under the brief H·ªì Dynasty, he passed examination and served for a time in the government. In 1406, Ming forces invaded and conquered Vietnam. Under the occupation, the Ming China attempted to convert Vietnam into a Chinese province and ruthlessly quashed all rebellions. The silk painting of Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i (15th century) =War of independence= Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n reign (1433). Early L√™ dynasty, ancient capital of Lam Kinh, Thanh H√≥a Province, central Vietnam. Inscribed by Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i. Commemorative element. Inscription showed on biography of L√™ L·ª£i, leader of Lam Son uprising (1418-1427) against Ming invaders from China, from beginning to final victory and him becoming the first emperor of the Early L√™ dynasty in 1428. This stele is also one of typical stone sculptures of Vietnam fine art in the 15th century. National Museum of Vietnamese History, Hanoi. In 1417, Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i joined a rebel leader named L√™ L·ª£i, who was resisting the occupation from a mountainous region in Thanh H√≥a Province south of Hanoi. Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i served as the chief advisor, strategist and propagandist for the movement. The war of independence leading to the defeat of the Ming and the inauguration of the L√™ Dynasty lasted from 1417 to 1427.Renowned Vietnamese Intellectuals, p.55 ff. From 1417 until 1423, L√™ L·ª£i conducted a classic guerilla campaign from his bases in the mountains. Following a negotiated truce, L√™ L·ª£i, following the advice of Nguy·ªÖn Ch√≠ch, led his army to the southern prefecture of Ngh·ªá An. From Ngh·ªá An, Vietnamese forces won many battles and gained control over the whole part of Vietnam from Thanh H√≥a southwards. The Ming sent a series of military reinforcements in response to bolster their positions. In 1426, the army of a Chinese general named Wang Tong arrived in the Red River Delta. However, Vietnamese forces were able to cut supply lines and control the countryside, leaving Chinese presence totally isolated in the capital and other citadels. During this period, Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i sought to undermine the resolve of the enemy and to negotiate a favorable peace by sending a series of missives to the Ming commanders.An English translation of one such letter, under the title \\"New Letter to Wang Tong\\", has been published in Renowned Vietnamese Intellectuals, p.69 ff. In 1427 the Ming emperor Xuande sent two large reinforcing armies to Vietnam. L√™ L·ª£i moved his forces to the frontier, where they confronted and utterly defeated Chinese reinforcements in a series of bloody battles, most notably the battle of Chi LƒÉng-X∆∞∆°ng Giang. Wang Tong sued for peace. The numerous Chinese prisoners of war were all given provisions and allowed to return to China. Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i penned a famous proclamation of victory.An English translation of the proclamation, under the title \\"Proclamation of Victory over the Wu\\", has been published in Renowned Vietnamese Intellectuals, pp.63 ff. =Later life= After the war Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i was elevated by L√™ L·ª£i to an exalted position in the new court but internal intrigues, sycophantic machinations and clannish nepotism meant he was not appointed regent upon the emperor's death. Instead that position was bestowed upon L√™ S√°t, who ruled as regent on behalf of the young heir L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng. At some point during the regency of L√™ S√°t, having found life at court increasingly difficult, Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i retired to his country home north of Hanoi in the tranquil mountains of Ch√≠ Linh, where he enjoyed poetry writing and meditation. Today, visitors can visit this site where a large shrine of remembrance, covering from the foot of the mountain to the top is erected to honour the national hero. The site of Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i's house still exists, however only the tiled floors remain original. Close by is an ancient Buddhist temple, which has stood there several centuries before his time. Death Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i's death resulted from a scandal involving the young emperor, L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng, and the wife or concubine of Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i, named Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã L·ªô. Early in 1442, the young emperor began an affair with Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã L·ªô. This affair continued when the emperor visited the old scholar at his home. Not long after having left, L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng suddenly became ill and died. The nobles at the court blamed Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã L·ªô for the young emperor's death, accused them of regicide and had both, along with most members of their extended families, executed. Twenty years later, L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng's son, emperor L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng officially pardoned Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i, saying that he was wholly innocent in the death of Th√°nh T√¥ng's father. Legacy Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i, monument in Quebec City According to Loren Baritz (\\"Backfire: A History of How American Culture Led Us Into Vietnam and Made Us Fight the Way We Did\\", 1985), Trai set down the Vietnamese strategy against the Chinese in an essay. This essay would prove to be very close to the Communists' strategy of insurgency. Specifically you must, \\"subordinate military action to the political and moral struggle...better to conquer hearts than citadels.\\" Most cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him. Family Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i had 5 wives (or concubines) and 7 sons.

(Lady L√™'s)  Work  Being both a military tactician and a poet, Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i's works varied in many areas ranging from literature, history, geography, ceremony and propriety; many of them were missing after his execution. Most of his poems that survive until today were collected in ·ª®c Trai Thi T·∫≠p (·ª®c Trai's Poems Collection) by D∆∞∆°ng B√° Cung, printed in 1868 under Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty. His poems, written in both ancient Chinese (H√°n) and Vietnamese (N√¥m), were highly regarded by notable philosophers, poets, and politicians in Vietnamese history. In 2010, Vietnamese poet Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·ªó and American poet Paul Hoover published the first collection of Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i's poetry in English translation, titled Beyond the Court Gate: Selected Poems. The collection reflects Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i's metaphysical contemplation of tiny details in everyday life, but at the same time set him apart from Li Po's uses of extreme imaginary and formal poetic rules. Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i's poems demonstrate wit, humility, and a conversational tone, and express his personal perception and experience. An example of Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i's writing is his poem To a Friend (Traditional Chinese: Ë®òÂèã, Sino-Vietnamese: K√≠ H·ªØu, Vietnamese: G·ª≠i B·∫°n), as translated and edited by Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·ªó and Paul Hoover: Ë®òÂèã ÂçäÁîü‰∏ñË∑ØÂòÜÂ±ØÈÇÖÔºå Ëê¨‰∫ãÊÉüÊáâ‰ªòËÄÅÂ§©„ÄÇ ÂØ∏Ëàå‰ΩÜÂ≠òÁ©∫Ëá™‰ø°Ôºå ‰∏ÄÂØíÂ¶ÇÊïÖ‰∫¶Â†™ÊÜê„ÄÇ ÂÖâÈô∞ÁÑÇÂøΩÊôÇÈõ£ÂÜçÔºå ÂÆ¢ËàçÂáÑÊ∂ºÂ§ú‰ººÂπ¥„ÄÇ ÂçÅËºâËÆÄÊõ∏Ë≤ßÂà∞È™®Ôºå Áõ§ÊÉüËãúËìøÂùêÁÑ°Ê∞à„ÄÇ To a Friend My fate naturally has many twists and sharp turns, So in everything I trust in the wisdom of Heaven.

His stormy career ended in his enforced resignation. His words - \\"If reason and charity cannot promote the cause of truth and piety, I cannot see how it should ever flourish under the withering fires of wrath and strife\\" - epitomize his career.William H. Hudnut, III. \\"Samuel Stanhope Smith: Enlightened Conservative\\" Journal of the History of Ideas 1956 17(4): 540-552 Early life Smith was born in Pequea, Pennsylvania, on March 15, 1751. He was the son of Robert Smith (1723‚Äì1793) and Elizabeth (n√©e Blair) Smith (1725‚Äì1777). In 1769, he graduated as a valedictorian from the College of New Jersey (name later changed to Princeton University), and went on to study theology and philosophy under John Witherspoon. Career In his mid- twenties, he worked as a missionary in Virginia, and from 1775 to 1779, he served as the founder and rector of Hampden‚ÄìSydney College, which he referred to in his advertisement of 1 September 1775 as \\"an Academy in Prince Edward.\\"Virginia Gazette, Williamsburg, Virginia, 1 September 1775 The school, not then named, was always intended to be a college-level institution; later in the same advertisement, Smith explicitly likens its curriculum to that of the College of New Jersey. \\"Academy\\" was a technical term used for college- level schools not run by the established church.Brinkley, 5 and Appendix I, 847-50 Stanhope Smith held honorary doctorates from Yale and Harvard and was a leading member of the American Philosophical Society. =President of Princeton= Smith studied under president Witherspoon and returned to Princeton as a professor in 1779, and succeeded Witherspoon as president in 1795. The situation during the winter semester of 1806‚Äì07 under Smith's presidency was characterized by little or no faculty-student rapport or communication, crowded conditions, and strict school rules ‚Äî a combination that led to a student riot on 31 March‚Äì1 April 1807. College authorities denounced it as a sign of moral decay. Smith was active in the affairs of the Presbyterian Church and served as moderator of the 11th General Assembly in 1799. Smith was an urbane and cultivated man who sought, in the tradition of Witherspoon, to maintain orthodoxy while opposing tendencies toward rigidity and obscurantism. His efforts were unsuccessful, and he was forced to resign from his office in 1812 as a result of criticism from within the church. In his efforts to reconcile reason and revelation Smith left himself vulnerable to charges of rationalism and Arminianism.Mark A. Noll, Princeton and the Republic, 1768‚Äì1822 (1989); M. L. Bradbury, \\"Samuel Stanhope Smith: Princeton's Accommodation to Reason,\\" Journal of Presbyterian History 1970 48(3): 189‚Äì202 =Theories= Smith was the first systematic expositor of Scottish Common Sense Realism in America. An empiricist in his anthropology and a Lamarckian before Lamarck, he sought to mediate between science and religious orthodoxy. In his work, Stanhope Smith expressed progressive views on marriage and egalitarian ideas about race and slavery. The second edition of his Essay on the Causes of Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species (1810) became important as a powerful argument against the increasing racism of 19th-century ethnology.Dain 2002:40-41. He opposed the racial classifications of naturalists such as Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, Georges- Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, and Carl LinnaeusDain 2002:66. In this text, his attempt to explain the variety of physical appearances among humans involved a strongly environmental outlook. An example he provides involves \\"the blacks in the southern states.\\" Smith noted that field slaves had darker skin pigmentation and other \\"African\\" features than did domestic slaves, and hypothesized that exposure to white, European culture through their \\"civilized\\" masters had changed their anatomy as well. In Smith's essay titled Essay on the Causes of Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species, Smith claimed that Negro pigmentation was nothing more than a huge freckle that covered the whole body as a result of an oversupply of bile, which was caused by tropical climates.Marvin Harris, The rise of anthropological theory: a history of theories of culture, 2001, p. 87 In this essay Smith described the basic concept of sexual selection, this was before Charles Darwin later popularized the theory. Smith is also known for his attempt to refute Thomas Jefferson's claim in Notes on the State of Virginia, that there were no great black writers or artists.Dain 2002:67. In it, he attacked Jefferson's disregard of poetic abilities of Phillis Wheatley, African slave prodigy. Noah Webster cited Stanhope Smith in Webster's 1828 Dictionary in the definition of philosophy. The citation was from Stanhope Smith's second edition of his Essay on the Causes of Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species (1810). The quote as given,\\"True religion, and true philosophy must ultimately arrive at the same principle.\\".Webster, 1828: definition of philosophy Personal life On June 28, 1775, Smith was married to Ann Witherspoon (1749‚Äì1817), the daughter of his mentor and predecessor President. Together, they were the parents of: * Elizabeth Smith, who married John Marsden Pristard. * Frances Ann Smith (1780‚Äì1807), who married Judge John Bartow Prevost (1766-1825). * Anna Maria Smith, who married Thomas Callender (1778‚Äì1827). * Susan French Smith (1784‚Äì1849), who married Dr. Dirck G. Solomons. * Mary Clay Smith (1787‚Äì1864), who married Kentucky Secretary of State Joseph Cabell Breckinridge (1788‚Äì1823), the son of U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge and the father of Vice President John C. Breckinridge. * John Witherspoon Smith, who married Sarah Henrietta Duer (b. 1787), daughter of Continental Congressman William Duer. * Caroline Laurens Smith (1798‚Äì1814), who died young.

Lightweight test automation harnesses are not tied to a particular programming language but are most often implemented with the Java, Perl, Visual Basic .NET, and C# programming languages. Lightweight test automation harnesses are generally four pages of source code or less, and are generally written in four hours or less. Lightweight test automation is often associated with Agile software development methodology. The three major alternatives to the use of lightweight software test automation are commercial test automation frameworks, Open Source test automation frameworks, and heavyweight test automation. The primary disadvantage of lightweight test automation is manageability. Because lightweight automation is relatively quick and easy to implement, a test effort can be overwhelmed with harness programs, test case data files, test result files, and so on. However, lightweight test automation has significant advantages. Compared with commercial frameworks, lightweight automation is less expensive in initial cost and is more flexible. Compared with Open Source frameworks, lightweight automation is more stable because there are fewer updates and external dependencies. Compared with heavyweight test automation, lightweight automation is quicker to implement and modify. Lightweight test automation is generally used to complement, not replace these alternative approaches. Lightweight test automation is most useful for regression testing, where the intention is to verify that new source code added to the system under test has not created any new software failures. Lightweight test automation may be used for other areas of software testing such as performance testing, stress testing, load testing, security testing, code coverage analysis, mutation testing, and so on. The most widely published proponent of the use of lightweight software test automation is Dr. James D. McCaffrey.

He played professional baseball for 17 years from 1905 to 1921, including ten seasons in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers of the American League from 1906 to 1913 and the St. Louis Terriers of the Federal League from 1914 to 1915. In 274 major league games, Willett compiled a 102‚Äì100 win‚Äìloss record with 142 complete games, an earned run average (ERA) of 3.08, 600 strikeouts, and 695 assists in 1,773 innings pitched. Early years Willett was born in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1884. He moved to Caldwell, Kansas, in his youth. Professional baseball career =Wichita Jobbers= Willett began his professional baseball career in the Western Association, playing for the Wichita Jobbers in 1905 and 1906. He compiled a 10‚Äì5 win-loss record with a 2.69 earned run average (ERA) in 16 games during the 1905 season and a 12‚Äì17 record in 38 games for Wichita in 1906. On August 27, 1906, in his final game in a Wichita uniform, Willett held Webb City to one run in 15 innings. Although he lost more games than he won in 1906, he reportedly lost a number of games on flukes and was regarded by many as the best pitcher in the Western Association. =Detroit Tigers= Willett's 1911 American Tobacco card On August 9, 1906, Willett was purchased from Wichita by the Detroit Tigers, and became the first Western Association player to make it with a major league club. Originally scheduled to remain with Wichita through the end of the 1906 season, the Tigers asked in late August that he report early. Willett made his major league debut with Detroit on September 5, 1906, pitching a five-hitter against Chicago. In the final month of the 1906 season, Willett appeared in three games, all as a starter, and compiled a 0‚Äì3 record with a 3.96 ERA. In 1907, Willett saw limited action with the Tigers, appearing in 10 games, six as a starter, and compiled a 1‚Äì5 record with a 3.70 ERA in 48-2/3 innings pitched. Willett became a regular starting pitcher for the 1908 Detroit Tigers team that won the American League pennant. He appeared in 30 games, 23 as a starter, and compiled a 15‚Äì8 record with a 2.28 ERA and 77 strikeouts in 197-1/3 innings pitched. Willett's best season was 1909 when he appeared in 41 games, 34 as a starter, and compiled a 21‚Äì10 record with a 2.34 ERA. He ranked among the American League leaders with 21 wins (third) and a .677 winning percentage (sixth). He also appeared in two games as a relief pitcher in the 1909 World Series, giving up no earned runs and three hits in 7-2/3 innings pitched against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Willett had another strong season in 1910. He appeared in 37 games, 25 as a starter, and compiled a 16‚Äì11 record and a 2.37 ERA. He remained a regular starting pitcher for the Tigers through the 1913 season, compiling records of 13‚Äì14 in 1911, 17‚Äì15 in 1912, and 13‚Äì14 in 1913. =St. Louis Terriers= In January 1914, Willett signed a contract to play for Mordecai Brown's St. Louis Terriers in the Federal League. The Terriers finished in eighth place in the Federal League in 1914, and Willett compiled a career-worst 4‚Äì17 record with a 4.27 ERA in 27 games. In 1915, Willett returned to the Terriers, though he was converted into a relief pitcher. He appeared in 17 games, all but two games in relief, and compiled a 2‚Äì3 record with a 4.61 ERA. He appeared in his last major league game on September 23, 1915, at age 31. =Major league career overview= Willett in 1912 Throughout his career, Willett had a propensity to hit batters with his pitches. He led the American League with 17 hit batsmen in 1912 and was among the league leaders seven straight years from 1908 to 1914. His career total of 106 hit batsmen ranks 73rd in major league history. Willett was an excellent fielding pitcher, consistently achieving a range factor in excess of the league average. Over his career, he had a range factor of 2.89 ‚Äî 71 points higher than the league average of 2.09 for pitchers. In 1910, Willett had 113 assists in 224 innings pitched, meaning that he had an assist every other inning. His range factor of 3.38 in 1912 was a remarkable 1.43 points higher than the league average of 1.95 ‚Äî meaning Willett got to nearly twice as many batted balls as the typical pitcher of his era. Willett was also a good hitter for a pitcher, batting .268 with a .333 on-base percentage and a .427 slugging percentage in 1911. In 1913, he raised his batting average to .283. Detroit trainer Harry Tuthill later recalled, \\"Ed always could hit, but he gave the fans a real thrill one afternoon at old Bennett Park, by clouting two home runs. And in that era of the comparatively dead ball, two home runs in a single game was quite a feat.\\" In 274 career games, Willett had a 102‚Äì100 win- loss record with 142 complete games, an earned run average of 3.08, 600 strikeouts, and 695 assists in 1,773 innings pitched. As a hitter, Willett was above average, posting a .199 batting average (130-for-652) with 56 runs, 5 home runs and 63 RBI. Defensively, he was above average, recording a .949 fielding percentage which was seven points higher than the league average at his position. =Minor leagues= Although his major league career ended with St. Louis in 1915, he continued to play in the minor leagues through the 1919 season, playing for the Memphis Chickasaws of the Southern Association in 1916, the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association in 1917, and the Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League in 1918 and 1919. In 1920, he played for the Rexburg, Idaho, club in the Snake River-Yellowstone League. He began the 1921 season with the Blankenship team in the Pacific International League and also played for a Victoria, British Columbia, team in the first half of the 1921 season. =Managerial career= On June 4, 1921, Willett took over as a player-manager for the Ogden Gunners in the Northern Utah League. He led Ogden to the second half pennant. He went on to manage the Grand Island Champions in 1922 and the Beatrice Blues in 1923, both clubs playing in the Nebraska State League. Family and later years Willett was married in 1908 and filed for divorce the following year in October 1909. He remarried to Elizabeth White on October 25, 1910, in St. Louis. Willett lived in Wellington, Kansas, in his later years and was managing an amateur baseball club there at the time of his death. He died from a heart attack in 1934 at age 50 in Wellington; he was found dead in his hotel room. He was buried at the Caldwell Cemetery in Caldwell, Kansas.

This rennet-free cheese is formed into a log shape and rolled in toasted pinhead oatmeal, to be served with oatcakes or dry toast. The texture is smooth, slightly thicker and grainier than clotted cream, while the colour is a pale primrose yellow. The fat content is typically 67-69%, which is comparable with rich continental cream cheeses such as mascarpone. Historically, it was a cheese for the wealthy, unlike the similarly-aged Crowdie, which is made from the by-products of skimming cream from milk and thus is considered a poor man's cheese. Caboc is Scotland's oldest cheese, dating from the 15th century in the Scottish Highlands. The cheese was first made by Mariota de Ile, the daughter of the chieftain of the Clan MacDonald of the Isles. At 12 years old, Mariota was in danger of being abducted by the Clan Campbell, who planned to marry her to one of their own and seize her lands. Mariota escaped to Ireland, where she learned how to make cheese. On her return, she passed the recipe to her daughter, who in turn passed it onto her daughter. The recipe is still a secret and has been handed down from mother to daughter ever since. The present maker is Mrs Suzannah Stone of Tain, who works with a team of eight local women and her cheese is sold under the seal of Highland Fine Cheeses Ltd. According to legend, the tradition of coating Caboc in oatmeal started as an accident. A cattle herder stored the day's cheese in a box which he had used to carry his oatcakes earlier that day. Apparently, the oatmeal-coated cheese was enjoyed so much that from that day, Caboc has been made with an oaten coating.Cheese.com entryHistorical and textural information from the Teddington Cheese Notes Category:15th- century establishments in Scotland Category:15th-century introductions Category:Cow's-milk cheeses Category:Cream cheeses Category:Scottish cheeses ","title":"Caboc"},{"id":"5046916","text":"Butlers Lane railway station serves the northern part of the Four Oaks district of Sutton Coldfield, England.

This is a miniseries of comic books (also available as a graphic novel) from Ted Naifeh. Polly Pringle is a sheltered young girl who lives at a boarding school and has no desire to go on any adventures‚Äîunlike her friend Anastasia, who describes Polly as \\"the dullest girl I've ever met\\". But one night Polly gets swept up in an adventure when she is captured by the former crew of the famous Pirate Queen Meg Malloy. The setting is an alternate-history version of San Francisco in the second half of the 19th century. Polly's boarding school is a house boat that looks like a huge Victorian-style home. The Golden Age of Piracy is now over, but Claudio, the son of the pirate king, is trying to follow in his father's footsteps.

Located north of Sanssouci Park and the Orangery Palace, it is known for the Bornstedt Crown Estate, former residence of Princess Royal Victoria, and the Bornstedt Cemetery with numerous tombs of famous personages. History Ruinenberg reservoir The settlement arose in the late 12th century, it was first mentioned in a 1304 deed. The Bornstedt manor comprised the present-day gardens of Sanssouci, it was acquired by the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William of Brandenburg in 1664. The Prussian king Frederick William I ceded the estates to the Potsdam orphanage; his son King Frederick the Great had to pay a significant compensation before building Sanssouci Palace from 1744 onwards. He had a water basin erected atop a hill north of the park in order to supply the fountain system, which ultimately failed due to lack of expertise. Frederick had the reservoir decorated with artificial ruins and the hill was called Ruinenberg. From about 1750 the Bornstedt fields were used as a proving ground of the Prussian Army, much to the chagrin of local cotters, until King Frederick William IV after his accession to the throne in 1840 repurchased the estates. He had the Bornstedt manor reorganised according to the concepts of Peter Joseph Lenn√© and turned it into a model agricultural business. The court architect Ferdinand von Arnim built a Norman tower atop Ruinenberg hill and had the Bornstedt manor house and church redesigned in an Italian style according to plans by Friedrich Ludwig Persius. The king also had the village church rebuilt by Friedrich August St√ºler in 1854. Bornstedt and Ruinenberg, In 1864 King William I of Prussia (German Emperor from 1871) handed the Bornstedt estate over to his son, Crown Prince Frederick and his wife Victoria, the daughter of Queen Victoria. The Princess Royal continued the agricultural business as a model farm, she had the manor rebuilt and her son Wilhelm II attended the Bornstedt village school. Upon the death of Emperor Frederick in 1888, however, Victoria left Bornstedt and retired to Friedrichshof Castle in Kronberg im Taunus. In 1928 the crown estates of Bornstedt and Sansouci were incorporated into Potsdam, the former Bornstedt municipality followed in 1935 (by personal decree of Hermann G√∂ring). It became the military base of the Wehrmacht Infantry Regiment 9 Potsdam and several barracks were erected in the vicinity. The Bornstedt Cemetery was enlarged with a \\"heroes' grove\\", decorated with a sculpture by Walter Lemcke. After World War II, the military facilities were used by the Soviet Army until 1993, today many buildings belong to the Fachhochschule Potsdam college campus. In 2001, the Bornstedt Fields were the site of the Federal Horticultural Exhibition (Bundesgartenschau). The present-day Volkspark includes the Potsdam Biosphere.

He also discovered several lost films. Everson's given first names were Keith William, but he reversed them so that \\"William K.\\" would mimic the name of Hollywood director William K. Howard, whom he admired. Early life and career Everson was born in Yeovil, Somerset, the son of Catherine (n√©e Ward) and Percival Wilfred Everson, an aircraft engineer.Profile, filmreference.com; accessed 1 May 2016. His earliest jobs were in the motion picture industry; as a teenager he was employed at Renown Pictures as publicity manager. He began to write film criticism and operated several film societies.Grimes, William. \\"William K. Everson, Historian And Film Preservationist, 67\\", The New York Times, 16 April 1996. Later career Following service in the British Army from 1946 to 1948, Everson worked as a cinema theatre manager for London's Monseigneur News Theatres. Emigrating to the United States in 1950 at age 21, he worked in the publicity department of Monogram Pictures (later Allied Artists)Everson biography, nyu.edu; accessed 1 September 2016. and subsequently became a freelance publicist. Concurrently with his employment as writer, editor and researcher on the TV series Movie Museum and Silents Please, Everson became dedicated to preserving films from the silent era to the 1940s which otherwise would have been lost. Through his industry connections, he began to acquire feature films and short subjects that were slated to be destroyed or abandoned. Many of his discoveries were projected at his Manhattan film group, the Theodore Huff Memorial Film Society, founded by Huff (the biographer of Charlie Chaplin), Everson, film critic Seymour Stern and Variety columnist Herman G. Weinberg as the Theodore Huff Film Society. After Huff's death, Everson added the word \\"Memorial\\". At each screening, Huff members were presented with extensive program notes written by Everson about each film. During the 1960s, these screenings were held in a hall at Union Square. Occasionally, he would make special arrangements with a select invited group to see a 35mm print in a theater. For example, on a Sunday morning in the mid-1960s, he took over Daniel Talbot's New Yorker Theater to show the silent She (1925) to an audience of no more than 15 silent-film buffs. Later, the Huff Society screenings relocated from Union Square to The New School, by invitation of Everson's friend and fellow Huff Society member Joseph Goldberg, who was a professor at The New School. Everson was an influential figure to the generation of film historians who came of age from the 1960s to the 1980s, many of whom were regulars at his New School screenings. Other attendees at the Huff Society included such New York personalities as author Susan Sontag and publisher Calvin Beck. Kevin Brownlow described an infamous incident at the Huff Society: > It was a society that showed the rarest films ‚Äî often in a double bill with > a recognised classic. Everson's programme notes became world-famous (and let > us hope that some enterprising publisher will bring them out). In 1959, > MGM's Ben-Hur received rave reviews and Everson felt they were not deserved > ‚Äî so he showed the 1925 version at the Huff. Rival collector Raymond > Rohauer, experiencing a little trouble himself over a lawsuit from MGM, told > the FBI what Everson was doing, and they confronted him after the > performance.

It would be no exaggeration to say that > single-handedly, he transformed the attitude of American film enthusiasts > towards early cinema. Many of Everson's film programs were assembled from his own personal collection, which comprised over 4,000 titles by the 1970s. These screenings usually showcased minor masterpieces and critically overlooked B pictures that he deemed worthy of reappraisal. He brought these rediscoveries to other venues, such as the Pacific Film Archive and the Telluride Film Festival. He worked as a consultant to producers and studios preparing silent-film projects, and collaborated closely with Robert Youngson, screening and assembling the best in silent comedy for Youngson's feature-length revivals. (Everson even wrote some of Youngson's promotional feature articles for publication.) He assisted in the production of the syndicated TV series The Charlie Chaplin Comedy Theatre (1965) and its offshoot feature film The Funniest Man in the World (1967). He was technical advisor on David L. Wolper's TV specials Hollywood, the Golden Years (1961) and The Legend of Rudolph Valentino (1982). From 1964 to 1984 he taught film history at The School of Visual Arts, and from 1972 to 1996 was professor of cinema studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. He also taught film history courses at The New School. His courses often had an emphasis on comedy, Westerns and British films. Everson sometimes discussed film history as a guest on Barry Gray's late-night radio talk show in New York. He appeared as an actor in Louis McMahon's serial parody Captain Celluloid vs. the Film Pirates (1966); the four-part film, made by a cast and crew of like-minded movie buffs, concerned heinous traffic in rare silent-screen masterpieces.\\"Captain Celluloid vs. the Film Pirates\\", imdb.com; accessed 1 May 2016.

The regiment served for almost a year in Northern Virginia without seeing major action. In June, 1862, Dawes was promoted to major. He served with his regiment at the Second Battle of Bull Run, South Mountain, Antietam, and Fredericksburg. He was in command of the regiment for most of the Battle of Antietam after Lt. Colonel Edward S. Bragg was shot and injured. In March, 1863, Dawes received a promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel and served in the Chancellorsville Campaign, leading a river crossing under fire at Fitzhugh's Crossing on April 29.Magnusen, Steve. \\"To My Best Girl\\", Indianapolis, IN, Dog Ear Publishing, LLC, 2018 () pp. 76-85, 88-124, and 234-239. During the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, Dawes led a counterattack on Confederate Brigadier General Joseph R. Davis's brigade of the 2nd, 11th and 42nd Mississippi Infantry Regiments and the 55th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, many of whom were sheltered in an unfinished railroad cut west of town, and forced the surrender of more than 200 of the Confederate soldiers. He later served that year in the Mine Run Campaign. During a furlough, Dawes returned to Ohio and married Mary Beman Gates (1842‚Äì1921), from Marietta, Ohio, on January 18, 1864. Returning to the Army of the Potomac, he served at the Battle of the Wilderness and the Siege of Petersburg In July 1864, Dawes was offered the full rank of colonel, but declined the promotion. He was mustered out of the army on August 10, 1864, following the Battles of Spotsylvania and Cold Harbor. On February 24, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Dawes for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on April 10, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 743.Hunt, Roger D. and Jack R.

After the war, Dawes became a Companion of the Ohio Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Some of Dawes' letters are available to researchers. From his time in the Civil War, Dawes likely suffered from post- traumatic stress disorder, although he was able to cope with the symptoms.Reid, John J. 'Crisis of the Ottoman Empire: Prelude to Collapse, 1838-1878'. Stuttgart: F. Steiner, 2000. . Retrieved July 12, 2012. p. 423. After the war Dawes returned home to Marietta, Ohio and entered the lumber business. In August of that year, his son Charles Gates Dawes was born, a future Vice President of the United States. In July 1867, Rufus C. Dawes was born at the family home. He would become a well-respected businessman and lawyer, being awarded Chicago's Most Distinguished Citizen Award\\" in 1934. A third son, Beman Gates Dawes, would later serve as a Congressman from Ohio, and Henry May Dawes would be a powerful banker who would serve as Comptroller of the Currency for the United States under Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. Rufus and Mary Dawes also had two daughters, Mary Frances Dawes Beach and Betsey Dawes Hoyt. Dawes also served on the Board of Trustees of Marietta College from 1871 until his death, 28 years later. He was also a Trustee for Ohio's Institute for the Deaf and Dumb. Dawes was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1881 as a representative from the 15th Congressional District. A Republican, he served for one term before losing his bid for re-election because he voted against the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.Sortland, R. A. (1958). Charles G. Dawes: Businessman in Politics. Unpublished manuscript, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH. p. 4. In 1890, he published a well-received account of his Civil War career, Service with the 6th Wisconsin Volunteers. This memoir was republished in Madison, Wisconsin by the State Historical Society of Wisconsin for the Wisconsin Civil War Centennial Commission, in 1962. His reputation as an orator and his influential voice for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Persia prompted President William McKinley to offer Dawes the position of Minister to Persia in 1897, a post he declined due to failing health. Dawes died two years later, August 1, 1899, in Marietta, Ohio and was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, Marietta. Dawes was elected to Marietta College's Hall of Honor in 2003.

It drains an area of the high North Cascades in the watershed of Puget Sound north of Seattle, and east of Mount Baker. With a watershed of approximately in a complex of deep valleys partially inside North Cascades National Park, it is the last major tributary of the Skagit before the larger river reaches its mouth on Skagit Bay. The river flows through Concrete, Washington, near its mouth and has two hydroelectric dams owned by Puget Sound Energy. Course The Baker River rises in the Cascade Range near Whatcom Peak, in the northern section of North Cascades National Park. It flows south, starting in the Baker River Valley north-east of Mount Shuksan. The river flows generally southwest through a steep glacial valley, receiving several short glacial-fed tributaries from surrounding mountains. Many of these tributaries harbor tall, but never officially measured waterfalls. Most of the southern half of the river is impounded in artificial lakes, both part of the . The first reservoir is -long Baker Lake, impounded by Upper Baker Dam. (The lake was formerly a natural lake, until its level was raised by the -high dam.) Lake Shannon, impounded by Lower Baker Dam, begins immediately below Baker Lake and stretches about downstream. Below Lower Baker Dam the Baker River flows unimpeded (except for a small weir at a fish passage station) for about a mile before emptying into the Skagit River. Most of Baker Lake is in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Upper Baker Dam is located in Whatcom County and Lower Baker Dam is located in Skagit County above the town of Concrete. Both dams are owned by Puget Sound Energy. Natural history Baker River at Concrete Baker River sockeye are the only known sustaining population of Sockeye salmon in the Skagit River drainage basin. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) has determined the Baker River sockeye to be genetically distinct from other sockeye salmon. As of 1992 the condition of the population was listed as \\"critical\\". In 1985 only 92 adults were found to return to the river. Since the 1990s, however, the population has recovered somewhat, in part due to improvements in the smolt trapping and transportation system. 20,235 fish were counted in 2003 and since 2010, the numbers have been between 10,000 & 30,000 fish counted per year. The WDFW and others' models predicted a run size for Baker sockeye of 46,268 in 2015. Before Lower Baker Dam was built in 1925 the fish had free access to the river and natural (pre- dammed) Baker Lake. The annual sockeye run at that time was estimated to be approximately 20,000 fish. Artificial enhancement began in 1896 when the State of Washington constructed a hatchery on Baker Lake. This was the first establishment for the hatching of sockeye salmon. The hatchery closed in 1933. The construction of Upper Baker Dam in 1959 inundated the natural Baker Lake and surrounding valley, including the spawning grounds of the Baker River sockeye. Artificial spawning beds were constructed at the upper end of the new Baker Lake. An additional spawning beach was built on Sulfur Creek in 1990. All returning sockeye are trapped below Lower Baker Dam and transported to the artificial spawning beaches. The Baker River also supports other anadromous salmonids such as coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon, winter‚Äì and summer‚Äìrun steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and sea- run cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki).

She was one of the first women in the United Kingdom to be elected to a school board.Late 19th century school boards were public bodies with powers to raise funds locally to provide primary education. The first 30 years Stevenson was born in Glasgow, the youngest daughter of Jane Stewart Shannan, daughter of Alexander Shannan, merchant of Greenock and James Stevenson FRSE (1786-1866), a merchant. Stevenson was one of a large family including her fellow-campaigner and sister Louisa, the architect John James Stevenson, and MP James Cochran Stevenson. The family moved to Jarrow in 1844 when James Stevenson became partner in a chemical works. After he retired, in 1854, the family moved to Edinburgh shortly before Mrs Stevenson died, and in 1859 they settled in a house at 13 Randolph CrescentEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1860 where Louisa, Flora, Elisa Stevenson (1829-1904), an early suffragist, and Jane Stevenson (1828-1904) spent the rest of their lives (the house now bears a plaque to \\"women of achievement\\"). Her first educational project was an evening literacy class for \\"messenger girls\\" in her own home. She was an active member of the Edinburgh Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, and a committee member of the United Industrial Schools of Edinburgh, organising education in ragged schools for some of the most neglected children of the city. She and her sister Louisa were involved in the movement to open university education to women, and as members of the Edinburgh Ladies' Educational Association,Later called the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women they were at the first course of lectures for women given by Professor David Masson in 1868. School board work and other causes Flora Stevenson School, Comely Bank Edinburgh by John Alexander Carfrae The 1872 Education (Scotland) Act made it possible for women to serve on School Boards.This had happened two years earlier in England with the Elementary Education Act 1870. Stevenson's friend Henry Kingsley had told her that she \\"was exactly the kind of person\\" who should have this opportunity.Obituary She was one of the first two women to be elected, and continued in this role for her whole life, eventually becoming chairman of the board. Her experience in working with the poorest children meant that as soon as she was elected she started work on a scheme offering food and clothing in exchange for a commitment to attend school. She was convenor of the attendance committee for many years and gave evidence on this subject to a select committee on education in Scotland in 1887. She believed strongly in the value of industrial schools for \\"delinquent\\" children and her efforts led to the innovative day (non-residential) industrial school at St John's Hill on the fringes of Edinburgh's Old Town. In the 1890s she was involved in plans for the Day Industrial Schools Act (1893), the Scottish Office departmental committee on juvenile delinquents, and a committee advising the Scottish Office on reformatories for inebriates. Stevenson was a strong supporter of good quality education for girls. She disapproved of girls in Edinburgh schools spending five hours on needlework each week while the boys were having lessons, though she promoted the Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic Economy. She told a newspaper, \\"By all means let the girls of this generation be trained to be good \\"housemothers\\" but let it not be forgotten that the well-being of the family depends equally on the \\"housefather\\".\\"The Scotsman 28 September 1876 As well as support for women's suffrage, Stevenson's political views included a belief in strongly enforced school attendance, which she felt was the key to improving the lives of deprived children, and opposition to free school meals, which she thought should be the responsibility of parents, supported by charities when necessary. These themes were sometimes addressed in her lectures on educational subjects, which were usually \\"cordially received\\".See, for example, The Scotsman 21 October 1901 She was a vice- president of the Women's Free Trade Union while tariff reform was a contentious issue, and also of the Women's Liberal Unionist Association. She was involved with many other social projects and charities. She and Louisa paid for their niece, Alice Stewart Ker, to study medicine in Berne for a year. Alice was to become the 13th female British doctor. Honours and her last years The grave of Flora Stevenson, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh In 1899 a new school at Comely Bank, Edinburgh was named after her, and it continues as the Flora Stevenson Primary School. The last few years of her life brought further honours: an honorary LLD from the University of Edinburgh in 1903, a portrait commissioned by public subscription and painted by Alexander Roche in 1904, the freedom of the City of Edinburgh in 1905. Her final years were spent at her house at 13 Randolph Crescent in Edinburgh's West End.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1905-6 She was ill and an operation in St Andrews failed to help. She died there in her hotel and was brought back to Edinburgh for a funeral service and burial in the Dean Cemetery on 30 September 1905, two days after her death. The streets on the way to the cemetery were filled with many mourners, including two or three thousand schoolchildren. Her grave lies on the southern boundary wall above the southern terrace.

It is long, and its drainage basin is . Its final stretch forms the border between the historical duchies of Normandy and Brittany. Its historically irregular course, alternating between two beds on the north and south of the Mont Saint-Michel but eventually definitely settling to the south bed, inspired the saying \\"The Couesnon in its madness placed the Mont in Normandy\\" (\\"le Couesnon en sa folie mit le Mont en Normandie\\"), as the Mont is just to the Norman side of the river's current mouth. However, the administrative boundary separating the two regions does not depend on the course of the river, and is about six kilometers west of the Mont. The mouth of the Couesnon, at Mont Saint-Michel  Geography  The muddy edges of the Couesnon are almost like quicksand to the unwary. The Couesnon, the S√©e and the S√©lune form part of the complex water system of the bay of Mont Saint-Michel. On one side, the tide brings large quantities of sediment which cause large sandbars within the river. On the other, the three watercourses drive the sediment back out to sea. In the 20th century, the Couesnon was turned into a canal, to reduce the erosion of its banks. In 1969, a dam was built. These modifications, and the causeway linking Mont Saint-Michel to the mainland, have caused the buildup of mudflats. To prevent the Mont becoming too connected to the mainland, plans are in place to replace the causeway with a bridge, and to modify the dam so that the sediment can once again be driven out to sea. During spring tides, a tidal bore ‚Äî a wave caused by the incoming tide ‚Äî can be seen working its way up the river.

Initial dolls in the series are: *Victoria Silvstedt *Karen McDougal *Dalene Kurtis *Ava Fabian *Marilyn Monroe The original concept was to release them as limited production run dolls for collectors every year after initial launch. The dolls boasted features such as soft plastic skin, joint articulation for realistic movement, and \\"anatomically correct\\" modelling. Wax casting of the face, hands, and certain other body parts was used to model those areas. Sculptors worked very closely with the Playmates throughout the process. For some of the latter dolls, computer scans of the Playmate's body was used. The proto-type painting schemes and colors for the skin and make-up for each doll was designed by Joe Petro a Los Angeles-based freelance artist. The clothing for the dolls was usually modelled after the clothing used in the Playmate's pictorial or, in the case of Marilyn Monroe, a timeless classic costume associated with the subject. All dolls included a numbered certificate of their production run. A small number of these certificates were also signed by the artist Joe Petro.

The regiment ensures the security of the Kremlin, its treasures, and state officials. In accordance with the federal law of December 8, 1997 \\"On Immortalizing the Soviet People‚Äôs Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941‚Äì1945\\", the regiment also maintains a guard of honor () at the eternal flame of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The regiment is housed in the historic Kremlin Arsenal. History Soviet guard on their way to Lenin's mausoleum, 1988 Soviet guard on their way from Lenin's mausoleum, 1990 When the leaders of the Soviet Union moved from Petrograd to the Moscow Kremlin in early 1918, their protection was entrusted to the Red Latvian Riflemen, under the command of the Commandant of the Kremlin Garrison. In September 1918, the Latvian Riflemen left for the fronts of the Civil War, and they were replaced by the officer cadets of the 1st WPKA Soviet Joint Military School \\"All- Russian Central Executive Committee\\" that were redeployed into the Kremlin for this purpose. In 1924, they were assigned with the duty to guard Lenin's Mausoleum by orders of the ARCEC. In October 1935, the officers' academy left the Kremlin for the Moscow district of Lefortovo and a Special Purpose Battalion was created to replace them on Kremlin and Mausoleum guard duties. On January 28, 1936, the battalion ‚Äì and the Kremlin Garrison (Komendatura Kremlya), to which it was subordinated ‚Äì were transferred from the People's Commissariat of Defense of the USSR to the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD) of the USSR. The UKMK and the 1st Division were separate public security units with neither subordinate to the other, which would not prevent them collaborating closely in Kremlin security activities. On April 8, 1936, in accordance with Order No. 122 for the Moscow Kremlin Garrison, the Special Purpose Battalion became the Special Purpose Regiment; this day is considered the birthday of the regiment. However, the Regiment's Day is celebrated annually on May 7. Since in recent years the date has also been the day of Russian presidential inaugurations, the new President of Russia, following his oath-taking ceremony, receives the salute of the regiment on this day. When the Great Patriotic War began in 1941, the units of the Kremlin Garrison were made responsible for defending the Kremlin, where the State Defense Committee and Chief Military Headquarters were located. On June 25, 1941, the Commandant of the Garrison ordered the regiment to reinforce the defenses, and the regiment set up round-the-clock guard on the Kremlin walls. In 1942‚Äì1943 four groups of snipers from the Kremlin Regiment were sent to the Western and Volkhov Fronts. The snipers killed more than 1,200 German soldiers and officers, losing only 97 men in combat.The Presidential Regiment On February 23, 1944 the Kremlin Regiment was decorated with the Order of the Red Banner. Three battalions from the regiment took part in the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 on Red Square. In 1952 the regiment was reorganized into the Separate Special Purpose Regiment. On May 7, 1965 it was decorated with the Order of the Red Banner for its military achievements during the Great Patriotic War. On May 8, 1967 the regiment took part in the unveiling ceremony of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the Alexander Garden. In 1973 the unit was renamed the Separate Red Banner Kremlin Regiment, later receiving an Order of the October Revolution. Before being deprived of Mausoleum guard duties in 1993 as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the constitutional crisis of that year, the regiment finally received its current designation in accordance with a presidential decree of March 20 that year, this time under the Federal Protective Service. Since 1997 the Kremlin Regiment has resumed guard duties by presidential decree on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and its Eternal Flame, keeping alive the legacy of those who served on the Eastern Front. Changing of the Guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Alexander Garden, Moscow On September 2, 2002 on the basis of the 11th Cavalry Regiment (the Moscow Military District movie-making cavalry unit) a cavalry escort unit was formed as part of the Presidential Regiment. Starting in 2004 a Guard Mounting ceremony has been held on Cathedral Square on Sundays, from March to October. On May 7, 2006 the regiment gained a new regimental color, modeled on the ones used by the Imperial Guard units. It has also recently acquired special ceremonial uniforms closely modeled on those worn on parade by the infantry and the cavalry of the Russian Imperial Guard until 1914. These are worn in addition to modern style dress uniforms adopted during the final years of the Soviet period. Both types of uniform are in dark green with medium blue piping, but the shoulder boards in the historical full dress is different, even through the ranks are just the same, while only officers wear epaulettes in the latter. When in modern dress uniforms, they wear blue berets or peaked caps, but wear the shako, gorgets and tall period boots with the historical full dress, carrying the SKS rifle or sabres in both cases. This is also the case of the Regiment's Presidential Band, which wears white uniforms similar to those by the Imperial Guard bands of the late 19th century. Uniforms based on the ones used by the infantry of the Regiment during the Second World War were worn for the first time by a platoon from the 1st Honor Guard Company during the 2015 Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo. On April 16, 2016, the Guard Mounting that day featured the first woman officer to serve in the Cavalry Squadron, the first time this had happened in a guard changing ceremony.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYfPIV3wsEU This was also the first to be live streamed online.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rCehtzkjjw Notable servicemen of Kremlin Regiment * Mikhail Kasyanov, former Prime Minister of Russiahttp://www.gazeta.ru/kasyanov.shtml * Alexander Korzhakov, former head of the Federal Protective Service of Russia * Andrei Lugovoi, deputy of the State Dumahttp://www.grani.ru/Events/Crime/m.127492.html who was later indicted by UK authorities on charges of murdering Alexander Litvinenko.

A section of a larger river affected by the tides is a tidal reach, but it may sometimes be considered a tidal river if it has been given a separate name. Generally, tidal rivers are short rivers with relatively low discharge rates but high overall discharge, which generally implies a shallow river with a large coastal mouth. In some cases, high tides impound downstream flowing freshwater, reversing the flow and increasing the water level of the lower section of river, forming large estuaries. High tides can be noticed as far as upstream. Oregon's Coquille River is one such stream for which that effect can be noticed.  Overview  The area of a tidal river can be difficult to define. The term \\"tidal river\\" generally encompasses the area upriver of the maximum limit of salinity intrusion and downriver of tidal water level fluctuations. This classification is based on both tidal trends and salinity. By this definition, a tidal river will be affected by tides, surges, and sea level variation, though its water may not have a high salinity content. If that is the case, this section of river can be known as a \\"tidal freshwater river\\" or a \\"river reach.\\" In terms of tides, tidal rivers are classified as microtidal (<2 m), mesotidal (2-4 m), and macrotidal (>4 m). Areas of brackish water seaward of the tidal river section are often called estuaries. A phenomenon commonly associated with tidal rivers is a tidal bore, where a wall of water travels upriver during a flood tide. Freshwater tidal rivers discharge large amounts of sediment and nutrients into the ocean. This is a necessary influx for the global water balance. Rivers contribute about 95% of sediment entering the ocean. Discharge estimates from freshwater tidal rivers are important for informing water resource management and climate analyses. These discharge amounts can be estimated using tidal statistics. Some challenges to estimating discharge amounts include reversing tidal flow, compensation flow for Stokes drift, spring-neap water storage effects, lateral circulation, and multiple distributaries or ebb and flood channels.  Threats  Tidal rivers face threats due to climate change and other human-caused impacts. In tidal river's deltas, mineral and water extraction, reduced sediment input, and floodplain engineering are causing the sinking of deltas. This, combined with rising sea levels, is causing tidal rivers to become deeper which amplifies the tidal motion and increases the extent of salt intrusion. Increasing salinity in tidal rivers could have a detrimental impact on freshwater organisms and alter tidal river ecosystems significantly. The increasing effect of deltaic subsidence, which is due to the removal of gas, oil, and water from deltas, will also increase the risk of flooding.  Tidal river examples  ;Rio de la Plata * Rio de la Plata is a tidal river on the border between Uruguay and Argentina and it is classified as microtidal as its tidal range is less than 1 meter. This river is significant mostly due to its size as more than one tidal wavelength can be accommodated in this river's estuary. Similarly to most tidal rivers, saltwater does not extend far up the river due to its large volume of freshwater discharge. ;Amazon River * This tidal river has the largest volume of sediment discharge and the largest drainage basin size. Because of its large size, saltwater never enters the mouth of the Amazon River and the limit of salinity is 150 km seaward of the river mouth. The Amazon River is classified as macrotidal as its tidal range is 4 to 8 meters at the mouth of the river. During low-flow periods, this rivers tidal area may extend over 1,000 km into the Amazon depression. Navigation The tidal behaviour of a river is an important consideration in riverboat navigation. For major rivers, such as the Saint Lawrence River (and the associated Saint Lawrence Seaway), publications such as an atlas of surface currents (or tidal currents) may be available, based on sophisticated hydrodynamic models, subject to empirical validation.

Cahill argues a case for the Irish people's critical role in preserving Western Civilization from utter destruction by the Huns and the Germanic tribes (Visigoths, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Ostrogoths, etc.). The book presents Western history from the collapse of the Roman Empire and the pivotal role played by members of the clergy at the time. A particular focus is placed upon Saint Patrick. The book details his early struggles through slavery, mirroring much of the content in The Confession of Saint Patrick. Initial portions of the book examine Ireland before the arrivals of Patrick and Saint Augustine of Canterbury. Particular focus is placed upon Saint Columba, the monks he trained, and the monasteries he set up in the Hiberno-Scottish mission. These holy men, according to Cahill, \\"single-handedly refounded European civilization throughout the continent.\\" (p. 4) Publication and reception How the Irish Saved Civilization was first published in March 1995 and appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List for almost two years. It was favourably reviewed in many general-interest, quality newspapers and magazines. However, it also provoked a number of critiques from other reviewers, some of whom offered qualified praise or outright rejections of the main thesis, and some of whom pointed out factual mistakes. One chief example of the latter was the misrepresented nature of the Germanic takeover of the Roman Empire. Lisa M. Bitel states in her review, in The Catholic Historical Review, that Cahill takes an \\"essentially Gibbon-esque view\\" and that the book is \\"pure and simple, a traditional legend of saints.\\" References External links * How the Irish Saved Civilization book review by Father John McCloskey @CatholiCity * How the Irish Saved Civilization @GoogleBooks Category:1995 non-fiction books Category:History books about Ireland ","title":"How the Irish Saved Civilization"},{"id":"5047046","title":"List of aviation accidents and incidents in the war in Afghanistan"},{"id":"5047064","text":"Dan Haigh (born 5 December 1980) is an English musician, film director, video game designer, writer and visual effects artist. He is best known as co- founder of synthwave band Gunship and as the bass player in the English rock band Fightstar.  Early life  Dan Haigh was born in Grimsby and later attended Rugby School.  Music  = GUNSHIP = Gunship (stylized as GUNSHIP) is a British Synthwave band formed in 2014 by Dan Haigh and Alex Westaway and later joined by drummer Alex Gingell. GUNSHIP's music has been described as \\"influenced by the soundtracks of 80s film, television shows, video games & cartoons\\". Haigh wrote the following summary of the project: \\"GUNSHIP is a neon soaked, late night, sonic getaway drive, dripping with luscious analog synthesizers, cinematic vocals and cyberpunk values, exploding from the front cover of a dusty plastic VHS case which has lain forgotten since 1984.\\" The band are credited with helping to popularize the synthwave scene and evolving it by adding rock song structure and extensive use of vocals to a predominantly instrumental genre. GUNSHIP have a reputation for creating innovative and interesting music videos and have collaborated with film director John Carpenter on their claymation homage to 1980s nostalgia \\"Tech Noir\\" co-written and directed by GUNSHIP and Lee Hardcastle. John Carpenter is quoted as describing GUNSHIP as ‚Äúnice and cool.‚Äù and that Gunships ‚ÄòTech Noir‚Äô is ‚ÄúOne of my favorite songs of the year. Gunship rules.‚Äù He also went on to say ‚ÄúIt would be fun to collaborate with Gunship.‚Äù GUNSHIP have also created the \\"first music video made in the GTA 5 Rockstar editor\\" for their song \\"The Mountain\\" and made a music video entirely from pixel art with Jason Tammemagi for their song \\"Revel In Your Time\\" The band's self- titled debut album received excellent reviews from both electronic and rock press alike and was credited with sounding simultaneously like \\"they dropped straight out of the decade itself.\\" and for its excellent modern production \\"first of all, the production on this album is absolutely pristine ‚Äì every fuzzy, reverb-soaked layer of analogue synthesizer sounds perfectly placed in the mix, balanced by melodramatic drum patterns that always stay true to their influence rather than taking a more standard EDM trajectory.\\" mixed by producer Carl Bown \\"It could easily earn a place in synthwave history as one of the first crossover albums\\". In a commentary about a band, a critic wrote, \\"There's no doubt the level of effort they put into everything resonates deeply in the 80s retro community and beyond\\". Dan Haigh has an extensive synthesizer collection and uses a combination of genuine vintage synthesizers and modern synths to achieve the GUNSHIP sound. The collection includes the Juno 106, DSI Prophet 12, DSI Prophet 6, MOOG MiniMoog, MOOG Mother 32, various Oberheim units, Access Virus TI2, MOOG little Phatty, Maschine, ARP Odyssey and a Roland D-50. = Fightstar = Dan Haigh is a founding member of the band Fightstar, a British rock band from London, formed in 2003. The band's line-up comprises lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Although generally considered a post-hardcore band, Fightstar are commonly known to implement additional metal and alternative rock elements into their sound, as well as several other genres. During the band's initial emergence, they were faced with much skepticism due to Simpson's former pop career. However, they began to receive positive reactions to early live shows and their debut EP, They Liked You Better When You Were Dead (2005), was a critical success. Since then, their four studio albums have all obtained top 40 chartings and critical praise. Following They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, Fightstar released their debut studio album Grand Unification in 2006. The album was regarded by one critic as \\"one of the best British rock albums\\" of the decade. The band went on to receive a nomination at the Kerrang! Awards for \\"Best British Band\\", before releasing their second album, One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours in 2007. The following year a compilation album including b-sides and rarities titled, Alternate Endings (2008) was released. The band then self-funded and co-produced their third album, Be Human (2009), which heavily featured orchestral and choral elements. It became their highest charting album after peaking at number twenty in the UK Albums Chart. The band announced an extended hiatus in 2010, allowing its members to concentrate on other projects, including two folk-oriented solo records by Simpson; before announcing their reunion in 2014. The following year, they released their fourth studio album, Behind the Devil's Back, which added electronic elements to their previously known sound. = Film music = Dan Haigh has composed music for numerous film projects.

Paran = Game music = Dan Haigh composed the theme music for the popular WW2 game 'Day Of Defeat'  Video game designer  When Haigh first saw id software's DooM he knew he had to become involved with game development. Dan grew up playing games on an Amiga 500 and credits some of his favorite early games as Syndicate (Amiga), Doom 2 (PC), Quake (PC), Beneath a Steel Sky (CD32), Blade Runner (PC), Alien Breed (Amiga), and the Monkey Island series. Haigh was part of the early mod scene and worked on numerous mods including Rocket Arena 3, \\"Target Quake\\", and later went onto form Lethargy Software with Alex Gingell whom were responsible for the Quake 1 mission pack \\"Deaths Dominion\\" and most notably the \\"Oblivion\\" mission pack for Quake 2 which PC Gamer released as a cover disk Haigh and Gingell conceived the game and together managed a team of 10 amateur modders and tackled the bulk of the design work in order to bring the game to life. Electronic Arts hired Haigh after seeing \\"Oblivion\\" and he went to work on his first official title - Quake 3 Revolution. Haigh later worked for Gearbox Software, pocketeers and Valve  Director  Dan Haigh co-founded the production company Horsie In The Hedge with Alex Gingell in 2005 and has directed numerous music videos and other film material. Haigh wrote and directed the video for Tesseract's 'Singularity' with long time collaborators Alex Gingell and Alex Westaway. Produced by Horsie In The Hedge and Pari Passu films, directing team \\"Horsie In The Hedge\\" (Dan Haigh, Alex Gingell, and Alex Westaway) brought together Bafta nominated and Emmy award-winning director of photography Mark Wolf (Blue Planet) and Richard Van den Bergh's team at Evolution VFX (Skyfall) in order to create a visually arresting and cerebrally stimulating music video. At the behest of the directing team the video embraces and celebrates real life practical visual effects, prosthetics and make-up in stark contrast to most modern CGI laden horror / science fiction works. \\"Can experiences in the mind, if perceived intensely enough, cause manifestations in reality?\\" is the question driving this exploration of the darker side of the human imagination. The video is deliberately left open to interpretation but also proposes \\"What if this was possible... and what if foreign entities used this methodology as a conduit for cross-species reproduction...\\" Haigh co-wrote and directed the competitive trailer for 'In God We Trust' also known as Human Instrumentality Project. The trailer is heavily influenced by Neon Genesis Evangelion, (as are numerous of Haigh's other creative projects) taking contemporary adaptations of some of its core religious themes. The first video Dan Haigh directed for Fightstar was a collaboration with Alex Gingell for the song Palaniuk's Laughter. Haigh was involved to at least some degree in the great majority of Fightstar's music videos. Full details to follow. In the games industry Dan designed levels for games such as Quake and Counter Strike under the pseudonym Inflict. Dan worked for Electronic Arts, Bullfrog, Gearbox Software, Valve and Pocketeers. Aside from design, Dan also created music for video games, most notably for Valve's Day Of Defeat. In the film industry Dan co-founded the London-based production company 'Horsie In The Hedge'. He has written and directed numerous music videos including Tesseract‚Äôs controversial video \\"Singularity\\" and Fightstar's videos for \\"Palahniuk's Laughter\\" and \\"Paint Your Target\\". Dan also co-wrote and directed the film In God We Trust. Dan also made graphics for the Fightstar EP They Liked You Better When You Were Dead. Dan used to skateboard for Purple Team Skateboards. Dan is currently working on a new musical project called GUNSHIP with Alex Westaway.

Key goals are to conserve and enhance the quality and diversity of fish and wildlife and their habitats, to restore floodplain functions in the river corridor, and to provide wildlife-related recreational experiences for the public. Several units within the Complex were established in the 1940s following construction of the lock and dam system. Those units were consolidated into Mark Twain National Wildlife Refuge in 1958. Since then, other areas have been added to Mark Twain, which now includes scattered along of the Mississippi River and short distances up the Illinois and Iowa rivers.

The distance to this point is called the range of the particle. The range depends on the type of particle, on its initial energy and on the material through which it passes. For example, if the ionising particle passing through the material is a positive ion like an alpha particle or proton, it will collide with atomic electrons in the material via Coulombic interaction. Since the mass of the proton or alpha particle is much greater than that of the electron, there will be no significant deviation from the radiation's incident path and very little kinetic energy will be lost in each collision. As such, it will take many successive collisions for such heavy ionising radiation to come to a halt within the stopping medium or material. Maximum energy loss will take place in a head-on collision with an electron. Since large angle scattering is rare for positive ions, a range may be well defined for that radiation, depending on its energy and charge, as well as the ionisation energy of the stopping medium. Since the nature of such interactions is statistical, the number of collisions required to bring a radiation particle to rest within the medium will vary slightly with each particle (i.e., some may travel further and undergo fewer collisions than others). Hence, there will be a small variation in the range, known as straggling. The energy loss per unit distance (and hence, the density of ionization), or stopping power also depends on the type and energy of the particle and on the material. Usually, the energy loss per unit distance increases while the particle slows down. The curve describing this fact is called the Bragg curve. Shortly before the end, the energy loss passes through a maximum, the Bragg Peak, and then drops to zero (see the figures in Bragg Peak and in stopping power). This fact is of great practical importance for radiation therapy. The range of alpha particles in ambient air amounts to only several centimeters; this type of radiation can therefore be stopped by a sheet of paper. Although beta particles scatter much more than alpha particles, a range can still be defined; it frequently amounts to several hundred centimeters of air.

It was built from 1898 to 1904 by order of German Emperor William II according to plans by Ernst von Ihne in Baroque Revival style. The building's front square featured a memorial to German Emperor Frederick III, which was destroyed by the East German authorities.Bodemuseum (Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum) (in German) Landesdenkmalamt Berlin Currently, the Bode-Museum is home to the Skulpturensammlung, the Museum f√ºr Byzantinische Kunst and the M√ºnzkabinett.Bode-Museum (in English) Staatliche Museen zu Berlin History and collections The Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum in 1904 with the memorial on the front square Originally called the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum after Emperor Frederick III, the museum was renamed in honor of its first curator, Wilhelm von Bode, in 1956. Closed for repairs since 1997, the museum was reopened on October 18, 2006 after a ‚Ç¨156 million refurbishment. True to the ethos of its founding director, Wilhelm von Bode, who believed in mixing art collections,Alan Riding (November 27, 2006), German Museums Move Closer to Reunification The New York Times. it is now the home for a collection of sculptures, Byzantine art, and coins and medals.History ‚Äì Sculpture Collection and Museum of Byzantine Art. The presentation of the collections is both geographic and chronological, with the Byzantine and Gothic art of northern and southern Europe displayed separately on the museum‚Äôs first floor and a similar regional division of Renaissance and Baroque art on its second floor. The sculpture collection displays artwork of the Christian Orient (with an emphasis on Coptic Egypt), sculptures from Byzantium and Ravenna, sculptures of the Middle Ages, the Italian Gothic, and the early Renaissance, including the controversial Flora attributed by Bode to Leonardo da Vinci but now widely argued to be a 19th century work. Late German Gothic works are also represented by Tilman Riemenschneider, the south German Renaissance, and Prussian Baroque art up to the 18th century. In the future selected works of the Gem√§ldegalerie will be integrated into the sculpture collection. This is reminiscent of William von Bode's concept of \\"style rooms\\", in which sculptures, paintings, and crafts are viewed together, as was usual in upper middle-class private collections. The M√ºnzkabinett (\\"coin cabinet\\") is one of the world's largest numismatic collections. Its range spans from the beginning of minting in the 7th century BC in Asia Minor up to the present day. With approximately 500,000 items, the collection is a unique archive for historical research, while its medal collection also makes it an important art exhibition. Writing in The Financial Times on the occasion on the museum's reopening in 2006, Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, hailed ‚Äúthe most comprehensive display of European sculpture anywhere.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúIt is no exaggeration to say that in the new Bode Museum, Europe will be able for the first time to read its history ‚Äî aesthetic and religious, intellectual and political ‚Äî in a three-dimensional form.‚Äù Canadian gold coin theft On 27 March 2017, a solid gold coin called the Big Maple Leaf, issued by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2007 as a commemorative piece, was stolen from the museum.Guardian report remembers the theft The coin, at 50 cm in diameter and 2.8 cm in thickness, is made of 24-karat gold and is worth around ‚Ç¨3.7 million.

Species were about three meters (ten feet) long. The genus is known only from the 'Seymouran' Land Vertebrate Faunachron, which is equivalent to the upper part of the Artinskian stage and the lowermost Kungurian stage of the Early Permian. Its fossils were found in the U.S. states of Ohio and Texas. It was a carnivore and preyed upon animals close to its size. Ctenospondylus had a long tail, short back spines, and a very deep yet narrow skull with massive jaws that had sharp teeth. Because of its large size, it was probably the apex predator in its environment, and might have competed with other predators like Dimetrodon for food. A sphenacodontid, it was a close relative of Dimetrodon. In 1936, Alfred Sherwood Romer named the type species Ctenospondylus casei. The generic name, from Greek Œ∫œÑŒµŒØœÇ, kteis, \\"comb\\", and œÉœÜœåŒΩŒ¥œÖŒªŒøœÇ, sphondylos, \\"vertebra\\", referred to the form of the back sail. The specific name honoured Ermine Cowles Case, who first reported the type specimen in 1910.E.C. Case. 1910. \\"New or little known reptiles and amphibians of the Permian (?) of Texas\\". Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 28: 163-181 The fossil had been found in Archer County at the Slippery Creek site in the Belle Plains Formation, dating from the Artinskian. The holotype is AMNH 4047, already found in 1881 by William Fletcher Cummins, collecting for Edward Drinker Cope. It consists of a neck vertebra, two back vertebrae, two broken off spines and rib fragments.Romer, A.S. 1936. \\"Studies on American Permo-Carboniferous tetrapods\\". Problems of Paleontology, 1: 85‚Äì93 In 1964, far more complete material from Utah and Arizona was referred to the species by Peter P. Vaughn. This included specimen NTM VP 1001: a partial skeleton with skull; NTM VP 10014: a number of back vertebrae; NTM VP 10015: additional back vertebrae; NTM VP 10016: two skull bones; and NTM VP 10017: a series of three back vertebrae. The specimens are part of the collection of the Navajo Tribal Museum.Vaughn, P.P. 1964. \\"Vertebrates from the Organ Rock Shale of the Cutler Group, Permian of Monument Valley and vicinity, Utah and Arizona\\". Journal of Paleontology 38: 567‚Äì583 In 1978, David Berman named a second species: Ctenospondylus ninevehensis. The specific name refers to the Niniveh Limestone Member of the Greene Formation, dating from the Sakmarian where it was found at Clark Hill in Monroe County, Ohio. The holotype is specimen MCZ 3386, found by Donald Baird in June 1955. It consists of a partial skeleton with fragmentary skull, a spine from the axis, four back vertebrae, four tail vertebrae, neck ribs, dorsal ribs, a shoulder blade, two humeri, and the right pelvis. Specimen MCZ 4458, a right maxilla, was referred to the species. Berman considered C. ninevehensis more basal than Ctenospondylus casei and only referred the second species to the genus because of the similar spine length.Berman, D.S. 1978. \\"Ctenospondylus ninevehensis, a new species (Reptilia, Pelycosauria) from the Lower Permian Dunkard Group of Ohio\\". Annals of Carnegie Museum 47: 493‚Äì514 Later specimen MCZ 8635-42 was referred, a skull; MCZ 8665, a jugal bone and MCZ 3102, a skeleton with skull. The spines of Ctenospondylus are longer than those of Sphenacodon but shorter than those of Dimetrodon. They also lack the dumbbell-shaped upper profile of the latter genus and are more transversely flattened. The skull of Ctenospondylus is, as far as can be judged from the limited material found, very similar to that of other sphenacodontids.Eberth, D.A. 1985. \\"The skull of Sphenacodon ferocior, and comparisons with other sphenacodontines (Reptilia: Pelycosauria)\\".

Today, almost 75 million children across the world are prevented from going to school each day. As of 2015, 164 states were parties to the Covenant. The right to education also includes a responsibility to provide basic education for individuals who have not completed primary education from the school and college levels. In addition to these access to education provisions, the right to education encompasses the obligations of the students to avoid discrimination at all levels of the educational system, to set minimum standards of education and to improve the quality of education.  International legal basis  The right to education is reflected in international law in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Articles 13 and 14 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.Article 26, Universal Declaration of Human RightsArticle 13, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Article 14, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Article 26 states: > \\"Everyone has the right to education.

Education shall be directed to the full development of the > human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and > fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and > friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further > the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. Parents > have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to > their children.\\" The right to education has been reaffirmed in the 1960 UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, the 1981 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 24 and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. In Europe, Article 2 of the first Protocol of 20 March 1952 to the European Convention on Human Rights states that the right to education is recognized as a human right and is understood to establish an entitlement to education. According to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right to education includes the right to free, compulsory primary education for all, an obligation to develop secondary education accessible to all in particular by the progressive introduction of free secondary education, as well as an obligation to develop equitable access to higher education in particular by the progressive introduction of free higher education. The right to education also includes a responsibility to provide basic education for individuals who have not completed primary education. In addition to these access to education provisions, the right to education encompasses also the obligation to eliminate discrimination at all levels of the educational system, to set minimum standards, and to improve quality. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has applied this norm for example in the Belgian linguistic case. Article 10 of the European Social Charter guarantees the right to vocational education.European Social Charter, Article 10  Definition  Education consists of formal institutional instructions. Generally, international instruments use the term in this sense and the right to education, as protected by international human rights instruments, refers primarily to education in a narrow sense. The 1960 UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education defines education in Article 1(2) as: \\"all types and levels of education, (including such) access to education, the standard and quality of education, and the conditions under which it is given.\\" In a wider sense education may describe \\"all activities by which a human group transmits to its descendants a body of knowledge and skills and a moral code which enable the group to subsist\\". In this sense education refers to the transmission to a subsequent generation of those skills needed to perform tasks of daily living, and further passing on the social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical values of the particular community. The wider meaning of education has been recognised in Article 1(a) of UNESCO's 1974 Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and Education relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. > \\"the entire process of social life by means of which individuals and social > groups learn to develop consciously within, and for the benefit of, the > national and international communities, the whole of their personal > capabilities, attitudes, aptitudes and knowledge.\\" The European Court of Human Rights has defined education in a narrow sense as \\"teaching or instructions... in particular to the transmission of knowledge and to intellectual development\\" and in a wider sense as \\"the whole process whereby, in any society, adults endeavour to transmit their beliefs, culture and other values to the young.\\" The Abidjan principles were passed in early 2019 and provide comprehensive guiding principles on the intersection between private education and the right to education  Assessment of fulfilment  The fulfilment of the right to education can be assessed using the 4 As framework, which asserts that for education to be a meaningful right it must be available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable. The 4 As framework was developed by the former UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, Katarina Tomasevski, but is not necessarily the standard used in every international human rights instrument and hence not a generic guide to how the right to education is treated under national law. The 4As The 4 As framework proposes that governments, as the prime duty-bearers, have to respect, protect and fulfil the right to education by making education available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable. The framework also places duties on other stakeholders in the education process: the child, which as the privileged subject of the right to education has the duty to comply with compulsory education requirements, the parents as the ‚Äòfirst educators‚Äô, and professional educators, namely teachers. The 4 As have been further elaborated as follows: * Availability ‚Äì funded by governments, education is universal, free and compulsory. There should be proper infrastructure and facilities in place with adequate books and materials for students. Buildings should meet both safety and sanitation standards, such as having clean drinking water. Active recruitment, proper training and appropriate retention methods should ensure that enough qualified staff is available at each school. * Accessibility ‚Äì all children should have equal access to school services, regardless of gender, race, religion, ethnicity or socio-economic status. Efforts should be made to ensure the inclusion of marginalized groups including children of refugees, the homeless or those with disabilities; in short there should be universal access to education i.e. access to all. Children who fall into poverty should be granted the access of education because it enhances the growth of their mental and social state. There should be no forms of segregation or denial of access to any students. This includes ensuring that proper laws are in place against any child labour or exploitation to prevent children from obtaining primary or secondary education. Schools must be within a reasonable distance for children within the community, otherwise transportation should be provided to students, particularly those that might live in rural areas, to ensure ways to school are safe and convenient. Education should be affordable to all, with textbooks, supplies and uniforms provided to students at no additional costs. * Acceptability ‚Äì the quality of education provided should be free of discrimination, relevant and culturally appropriate for all students. Students should not be expected to conform to any specific religious or ideological views. Methods of teaching should be objective and unbiased and material available should reflect a wide array of ideas and beliefs. Health and safety should be emphasized within schools including the elimination of any forms of corporal punishment. Professionalism of staff and teachers should be maintained. * Adaptability ‚Äì educational programs should be flexible and able to adjust according to societal changes and the needs of the community. Observance of religious or cultural holidays should be respected by schools in order to accommodate students, along with providing adequate care to those students with disabilities. A number of international NGOs and charities work to realise the right to education using a rights-based approach to development.  Historical development  In Europe, before the Enlightenment of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, education was the responsibility of parents and the church. With the French and American Revolution, education was established also as a public function. It was thought that the state, by assuming a more active role in the sphere of education, could help to make education available and accessible to all. Education had thus far been primarily available to the upper social classes and public education was perceived as a means of realising the egalitarian ideals underlining both revolutions. However, neither the American Declaration of Independence (1776) nor the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789) protected the right to education, as the liberal concepts of human rights in the nineteenth century envisaged that parents retained the primary duty for providing education to their children. It was the states obligation to ensure that parents complied with this duty, and many states enacted legislation making school attendance compulsory. Furthermore, child labour laws were enacted to limit the number of hours per day children could be employed, to ensure children would attend school. States also became involved in the legal regulation of curricula and established minimum educational standards. In On Liberty John Stuart Mill wrote that an \\"education established and controlled by the State should only exist, if it exists at all, as one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose of example and stimulus to keep the others up to a certain standard of excellence.\\" Liberal thinkers of the nineteenth century pointed to the dangers to too much state involvement in the sphere of education, but relied on state intervention to reduce the dominance of the church, and to protect the right to education of children against their own parents. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, educational rights were included in domestic bills of rights. The 1849 Paulskirchenverfassung, the constitution of the German Empire, strongly influenced subsequent European constitutions and devoted Article 152 to 158 of its bill of rights to education. The constitution recognised education as a function of the state, independent of the church. Remarkable at the time, the constitution proclaimed the right to free education for the poor, but the constitution did not explicitly require the state to set up educational institutions. Instead the constitution protected the rights of citizens to found and operate schools and to provide home education. The constitution also provided for freedom of science and teaching, and it guaranteed the right of everybody to choose a vocation and train for it. The nineteenth century also saw the development of socialist theory, which held that the primary task of the state was to ensure the economic and social well-being of the community through government intervention and regulation. Socialist theory recognised that individuals had claims to basic welfare services against the state and education was viewed as one of these welfare entitlements. This was in contrast to liberal theory at the time, which regarded non-state actors as the prime providers of education. Socialist ideals were enshrined in the 1936 Soviet Constitution, which was the first constitution to recognise the right to education with a corresponding obligation of the state to provide such education. The constitution guaranteed free and compulsory education at all levels, a system of state scholarships and vocational training in state enterprises. Subsequently, the right to education featured strongly in the constitutions of socialist states. As a political goal, right to education was declared in F. D. Roosevelt's 1944 speech on the Second Bill of Rights.  The role of education for individuals, the society and the state  Education in all its forms (informal, non-formal, and formal) is crucial to ensure human dignity of all individuals. The aims of education, as set out in the International human rights law (IHRL), are therefore all directed to the realization of the individual‚Äôs rights and dignity. These include, among others, ensuring human dignity and the full and holistic development of the human personality; fostering physical and cognitive development; allowing for the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and talents; contributing to the realization of the full potential of the individual; enhancing self-esteem and increasing confidence; encouraging respect for human rights; shaping a person‚Äôs sense of identity and affiliation with others; enabling socialization and meaningful interaction with others; enabling a person to shape the world around them enables their participation in community life; contributing to a full and satisfying life within society; and empowering and allowing for the increased enjoyment of other human rights. The multiple benefits of education Education is also transformative for the state and society. As one of the most important mechanisms by which social groups, in particular indigenous peoples and minorities are maintained from generation to generation, passing on language, culture, identity, values, and customs, education is also one of the key ways states can ensure their economic, social, political, and cultural interests. The main role of education within a society and the state is to: * Allow for the transmission of culture, values, identity, languages, and customs from one generation to the next; * Promote sustainable economic growth; * Foster democratic and peaceful societies; * Encourage participation and inclusion in decision-making processes; * Encourage a rich cultural life; * Help build a national identity; * Promote social justice aims; * Overcome persistent and entrenched challenges; * Encourage sustainable development, including respect for the environment.  Implementation  International law does not protect the right to pre-primary education and international documents generally omit references to education at this level. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to education, hence the right applies to all individuals, although children are considered as the main beneficiaries. The rights to education are separated into three levels: * Primary (Elemental or Fundamental) Education. This shall be compulsory and free for any child regardless of their nationality, gender, place of birth, or any other discrimination. Upon ratifying the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights States must provide free primary education within two years. * Secondary (or Elementary, Technical and Professional in the UDHR) Education must be generally available and accessible. * At the University Level, Education should be provided according to capacity. That is, anyone who meets the necessary education standards should be able to go to university. Both secondary and higher education shall be made accessible \\"by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education\\".Article 13 (2) (a) to (c), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights = Compulsory education = The realization of the right to education on a national level may be achieved through compulsory education, or more specifically free compulsory primary education, as stated in both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.Article 14, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  Right to education for children  The rights of all children from early childhood stem from the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The declaration proclaimed in article 1: ‚ÄòAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights‚Äô. The declaration states that human rights begin at birth and that childhood is a period demanding special care and assistance [art. 25 (2)]. The 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child affirmed that: ‚Äòmankind owes to the child the best it has to give‚Äô, including education. This was amplified by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 which states that: ‚Äòeducation shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity, and shall strengthen the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. [art. 13 (1)] The World Declaration on Education for All (EFA) adopted in 1990 in Jomtien, Thailand, states in article 5 that: ‚ÄòLearning begins at birth [...] This calls for early childhood care and initial education.‚Äô A decade later, the Dakar Framework for Action on EFA established six goals, the first of which was: ‚Äòexpanding and improving early childhood care and education, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children.‚Äô Protection of children of all ages from exploitation and actions that would jeopardize their health, education and well-being has also been emphasized by the International Labour Organization in Conventions No. 138 on the Minimum Age of Employment (1973) and No. 182 on the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (1999). The United Nations contributed to such endeavours by the Declaration of the Rights of the Child unanimously adopted by the General Assembly in 1959.  The impact of privatization on the right to education  The privatization of education can have a positive impact for some social groups, in the form of increased availability of learning opportunities, greater parental choice and a wider range of curricula. However, it can also have negative effects resulting from insufficient or inadequate monitoring and regulation by the public authorities (schools without licences, hiring of untrained teachers and absence of quality assurance), with potential risks for social cohesion and solidarity. Of particular concern: \\"Marginalised groups fail to enjoy the bulk of positive impacts and also bear the disproportionate burden of the negative impacts of privatisation.\\" Furthermore, uncontrolled fees demanded by private providers could undermine universal access to education. More generally, this could have a negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to a good quality education and on the realization of equal educational opportunities. Supplemental private tutoring, or ‚Äòshadow education‚Äô, which represents one specific dimension of the privatization of education, is also growing worldwide. Often a symptom of badly functioning school systems, private tutoring, much like other manifestations of private education, can have both positive and negative effects for learners and their teachers. On one hand, teaching can be tailored to the needs of slower learners and teachers can supplement their school salaries. On the other hand, fees for private tutoring may represent a sizeable share of household income, particularly among the poor, and can therefore create inequalities in learning opportunities. And the fact that some teachers may put more effort into private tutoring and neglect their regular duties can adversely affect the quality of teaching and learning at school. The growth of shadow education, the financial resources mobilized by individuals and families, and the concerns regarding possible teacher misconduct and corruption are leading some ministries of education to attempt to regulate the phenomenon.

The The agreement is officially called the . In English, the process is most commonly referred to as the \\"posting system\\", though it is also sometimes referred to as the \\"posting agreement\\". The corresponding Japanese term is most commonly written in katakana as \\"\\", though \\"\\" is sometimes used. is a baseball player transfer system that operates between Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and the United States' Major League Baseball (MLB). Despite the drafting of the United States - Japanese Player Contract Agreement, unveiled in 1967 to regulate NPB players moving to MLB, problems began to arise in the late 1990s. Some NPB teams lost star players without compensation, an issue highlighted when NPB stars Hideo Nomo and Alfonso Soriano left to play in MLB after using loopholes to void their existing contracts. A further problem was that NPB players had very little negotiating power if their teams decided to deal them to MLB, as when pitcher Hideki Irabu was traded to an MLB team for which he had no desire to play. In 1998, the Agreement was rewritten to address both problems; the result was dubbed the \\"posting system\\". Under this system, when an NPB player is \\"posted\\", his NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner, with the posting fee based on the type of contract a player signs and its value. The fee is a flat 25% of the value of a minor-league contract; for MLB contracts, the fee is based on the value of the contract that the posted player eventually signs. The player is then given 30 days to negotiate with any MLB team willing to pay the NPB team's posting fee. If the player agrees on contract terms with a team before the 30-day period has expired, the NPB team receives the posting fee from the signing MLB team as a transfer fee, and the player is free to play in MLB. If no MLB team comes to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee is paid, and the player's rights revert to his NPB team. The current process replaced one in which MLB held a silent auction during which MLB teams submitted sealed, uncapped bids in an attempt to win the exclusive negotiating rights with the posted player for a period of 30 days. Once the highest bidding MLB team was determined, the player could then only negotiate with that team. Up to the end of the 2017‚Äì18 posting period, 23 NPB players had been posted using the system. Of these, 12 signed Major League contracts, four signed minor-league contracts, five were unsuccessful in attracting any MLB interest, and two could not come to a contract agreement during the 30-day negotiation period. The five highest-profile players that have been acquired by MLB teams through the posting system are Ichiro Suzuki, Daisuke Matsuzaka, Yu Darvish, Masahiro Tanaka, and Shohei Ohtani. The first three attracted high bids of $13.125 million, $51.1 million, and $51.7 million respectively. Tanaka was the first player posted under a revised procedure that was in place from 2013 to 2017; he was posted for the maximum $20 million allowed under the new rules. Ohtani was the first player posted under the current procedure; his posting fee of $20 million was grandfathered in under the previous agreement. However, since its implementation the posting system has been criticized by the media and baseball insiders from both countries. History The first instance of a Japanese-born player playing in Major League Baseball was in 1964, when the Nankai Hawks, an NPB team, sent three exchange prospects to the United States to gain experience in MLB's minor league system. One of the players, pitcher Masanori Murakami, was named the California League Rookie of the Year while playing for the Fresno Giants (the San Francisco Giants' Class-A team). Giants executives were impressed with his talent and on September 1, 1964 Murakami was promoted, thus becoming the first Japanese player to play in MLB. After Murakami put up good pitching statistics as a reliever, Giants executives sought to exercise a clause in their contract with the Hawks that, they claimed, allowed them to buy up an exchange prospect's contract. NPB officials objected, stating that they had no intention of selling Murakami's contract to the Giants and telling them that Murakami was merely on loan for the 1964 season. After a two-month stalemate the Giants eventually agreed to send Murakami back to the Hawks after the 1965 season. Thus, after pitching one more season for the Giants, Murakami returned to Japan to play for the Hawks. This affair led to the 1967 United States - Japanese Player Contract Agreement, also known as the \\"working agreement\\", between MLB and NPB, which was basically a hands-off policy.Whiting 2004, pp. 75-80. =Complications= Japanese-born player to play in MLB, Hideo Nomo used a loophole to void his NPB contract. MLB and NPB officials created the posting system as a combined reaction to three cases in the 1990s, involving NPB players who moved to MLB. The first of these occurred in the winter of 1994 when pitcher Hideo Nomo, with the help of agent Don Nomura, became the second Japanese-born player to play in MLB, 30 years after Murakami. Nomo, who was not yet eligible for free agency in Japan, was advised by Nomura that the Japanese Uniform Players Contract's reserve clause limited the Kintetsu Buffaloes' control over him to Japan only.Whiting 2004, pp. 102-112.Klein 2006, p. 137. Nomo utilized this loophole by voluntarily retiring from NPB to terminate his contract with the Buffaloes, circumvent its reserve clause and play in MLB. He announced his retirement from NPB in late 1994 and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in February 1995, where he won the National League Rookie of the Year award. The following year, the Dodgers signed Nomo to a three-year, $4.3 million contract. Alfonso Soriano's move to MLB helped prompt the creation of the posting system. In early 1997, after months of negotiations, the San Diego Padres signed a working agreement with the Chiba Lotte Marines that gave the Padres exclusive signing rights to another Nomura client, Hideki Irabu. Although both Irabu and Nomura stated that Irabu would only sign with the New York Yankees, neither the Padres nor the Marines consulted Irabu before finalizing their deal. The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) sided with Irabu, stating that the arrangement unfairly disregarded a player's expressed wishes. However, MLB's executive council ruled that the Padres had not violated any existing rule, and therefore legally held the rights to Irabu. Following this decision, Irabu contemplated a number of different options, including playing in NPB until he became a free agent, and taking the matter to the U.S. judicial system. By May, however, the Padres gave in and traded Irabu to the Yankees, who signed him for $12.8 million over four years.Whiting 2004, pp. 130-134. The final incident occurred in 1998, when Alfonso Soriano was unable to leave the Hiroshima Toyo Carp due to contract restrictions. Soriano disliked the intense Japanese practice schedule, and the Carp denied him a salary increase from $45,000 (the league's minimum) to $180,000 per year.Klein 2006, p. 138. Like Nomo and Irabu, Soriano hired Nomura to help his situation. After first attempting to void Soriano's NPB contract by unsuccessfully arguing that the player was legally a minor when he signed it Nomura advised him, like Nomo, to retire from NPB and pursue a career in MLB. This prompted Carp executives to file an injunction against Soriano and send letters to MLB teams demanding that they cease all negotiations with him.Whiting 2004, pp. 142-144. NPB officials claimed that after the Nomo case they had privately amended the Player Contract to give NPB teams the right to prohibit a player from signing a new contract anywhere after voluntarily retiring.Klein 2006, p. 139. Since MLB officials were not consulted and they did not agree to any changes, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig declared that MLB would recognize Soriano as a free agent on July 13, 1998, and the Carp backed down. He signed a 5-year, $3.1 million contract with the New York Yankees the same year. =Resolution= In 1998, Orix BlueWave general manager Shigeyoshi Ino rewrote the 1967 United States - Japanese Player Contract Agreement, when he drafted the \\"posting system\\".Whiting 2004, p. 146. Selig and NPB Commissioner Hiromori Kawashima signed this new agreement in December 1998. It sought to address each of the problems brought up by the Nomo, Irabu and Soriano cases, by requiring MLB teams to place \\"bids\\" for NPB players. These bids became the basis of transfer fees that are paid as compensation to NPB teams whose star players sign with MLB. NPB players are also allowed to negotiate with MLB teams over the terms of their new contracts. Through the 2013 season, the agreement was in effect on a year-to-year basis, terminable at the option of either the MLB Commissioner or the NPB Commissioner provided notice to terminate is given by June 18 of any given year. A new agreement between MLB and NPB, with significantly different rules, was announced on December 16, 2013 and took effect immediately; it continued through the 2016 MLB and NPB seasons. The agreement was extended for an additional season during negotiations for a new agreement. The current posting agreement was reached after the 2017 MLB and NPB seasons. The agreement runs through October 31, 2021, the expiration date of MLB's current collective bargaining agreement. Not all of the provisions applied immediately‚Äîfor example, the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters were allowed to set a $20 million posting fee, the maximum allowed under the previous agreement, for two-way star Shohei Ohtani, whom they posted shortly after approval of the new agreement. Since the end of the 2018 NPB and MLB seasons, posting fees have been based on the type of contract a player signs and the deal's value. For players signed to MLB contracts, the posting fee is based on the amount of guaranteed money in the initial contract: * 20% of the first $25 million * 17.5% of the next $25 million * 15% of any amount above $50 million For players signed to minor-league contracts, the fee is a flat 25% of the contract's value. The system only applies to players currently under contract with a Japanese team, although players who have nine or more years of playing service with NPB are exempt. It does not apply to free agents or to amateur players who have never played in NPB. Mac Suzuki, Micheal Nakamura, Kazuhito Tadano, and Junichi Tazawa are the only Japanese players to have debuted in MLB without having played in NPB. The system does not work in reverse; it does not regulate MLB players, such as Alex Cabrera, who moved to NPB. Process When a player under contract with a Nippon Professional Baseball team wishes to play in Major League Baseball, he must notify his current team's management and request that they make him available for posting during the next posting period (November 1 ‚Äì March 1 through the 2013 season, and November 1 ‚Äì February 1 in the current agreement). The NPB team can reject this request, and the player will not be posted. However, if the team consents, the player is presented to the MLB Commissioner, who then notifies all MLB teams of the posted player. In the original process, MLB held a four-day-long silent auction during which interested MLB teams submitted sealed bids in U.S. dollars to the Commissioner's Office. After the allotted four days passed, the Commissioner closed the bidding process and notified the posted player's NPB team of the highest bid amount but not who the bidding team was. The NPB team then had four days to either accept or reject the non-negotiable bid amount. If the bid was rejected, the NPB team retained rights to the player. If it was accepted, the successful MLB team was granted the exclusive rights to negotiate with the player for 30 days. If the player and the MLB team agreed on contract terms before the 30-day period expired, the NPB team received the bid amount as a transfer fee within five business days. The player was then free to play for his new MLB team in the coming season. The transfer fee was not included when calculating an MLB team's total payroll, which is subject to a luxury tax when it exceeds $155 million. If the MLB team could not come to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee was paid and the rights to the player reverted to his NPB team. A player could request to be posted again in subsequent years, and the process would be repeated with no advantage to the club that had won the bidding the previous year. Under the current process, the NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner of a posting, with the posting fee determined by the value of the contract that a posted player eventually signs with an MLB organization. Once the MLB Commissioner announces the posting, the player has 30 days to sign with an MLB team. Unlike the past system, in which only the team that won the bidding process had negotiating rights, the current system allows the posted player to negotiate with any MLB team willing to pay the posting fee. As in the previous process, if the player signs with an MLB team during the negotiating window, the signing team will pay the posting fee; otherwise, his rights revert to his NPB team. Also mirroring the past system, an unsuccessfully posted player can request a posting in a later year, with the process repeated. Past postings Of the 58 Japanese-born players who have played in MLB, 16 have entered the league using the posting system. Since the system's creation in 1998, the 25 players that have used it have experienced a range of success. Of these 25, thirteen were immediately signed to Major League contracts and one player who drew no bids on his first posting was signed to a Major League contract on his second posting. These contracts range from $1.4 million to $155 million. Of the remaining eleven, three were signed to Minor League contracts, two were unable to reach a contract agreement and six were unsuccessful in drawing bids from any Major League clubs (one player failed to draw bids during two separate postings).

Criticism Since its implementation in late 1998 the posting system has been heavily criticized. Ichiro Suzuki's agent remarked that \\"the player literally gets zero advantage from [the posting system]... the Japanese teams benefit by holding the players hostage\\". Don Nomura called the process a \\"slave auction\\". Much of the criticism of the system stems from its forcing NPB players to negotiate their contracts solely with the MLB team that submitted the highest bid. The Japan Times columnist Marty Kuehnert believes that since no other team is allowed to submit competitive counter-offers, negotiations result in salaries below the player's market value. Kuehnert also believes the system fosters a \\"take-it-or-leave-it\\" situation; if the team and the player have not finalized contract negotiations by the end of a 30-day period, the team can make a low offer knowing that the player's only other option is to play in Japan for another year. It has been suggested that this is a violation of the Anti-Monopoly Act, a Japanese antitrust law that prohibits parties from signing an international agreement or contract that \\"contains such matters as constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade or unfair business practices\\".Siesta 2008, p. 1092. The Japan Professional Baseball Players Association (JPBPA) was not consulted before the system was implemented by NPB club owners, and did not subsequently ratify it.Whiting 2004, p. 147. Since its introduction JPBPA has expressed many concerns, likening the process to \\"human trafficking\\".Siesta 2008, p. 1095. Agreeing that the system takes unfair advantage of NPB players, the MLBPA offered to help JPBPA fight the posting system in court. However, according to one JPBPA official, the Japanese court process is too long and involved; therefore, the \\"problem can't be helped\\". Yomiuri Giants club representative Hidetoshi Kiyotake has expressed dislike of the system, because it enables Major League Baseball to poach players from Japan. By using the posting system, he says, Japanese teams make a profit in the short term, but by allowing Japan's best players to be sold to MLB, NPB teams and Japanese baseball suffer in the longer term. When Giants pitcher Koji Uehara asked to be posted in 2005, Kiyotake denied his request, saying: \\"We don't recognize the posting system. I've said from the beginning that this is out of the question.\\" In the middle of the 2012‚Äì13 posting season, MLB approached NPB seeking to change the way MLB teams bid for the right to negotiate with NPB players. Instead of using a silent auction in which teams bid blindly, MLB would prefer its teams to participate in a traditional, open auction where the bids are known and teams can knowingly outbid each other. Such a change would likely lower the price of the transfer fees paid to NPB teams. MLB and the players' unions agree that they'd prefer to see the players receive more money for the transfer rather than the teams. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey also believed that these talks provided the JPBPA an opportunity to voice their concerns about the posting system and attempt to gain more leverage for themselves during the posting process. The new agreement, as noted, was announced on December 16, 2013, with most of the changes desired by MLB and players from both leagues. =2006‚Äì07 controversy= The posting system was criticized after the Boston Red Sox paid a total of $103.1 million to sign pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka. The posting system was criticized by MLB insiders and by the U.S. media, after the controversial 2006‚Äì07 posting period. Before the posting of the period's first player, Daisuke Matsuzaka, in early November 2006, there was speculation that he might draw bids as high as $30 millionmore than twice the previous record bid that Ichiro Suzuki had garnered in 2000‚Äì01. After his silent auction was closed, it was revealed that Matsuzaka had drawn a bid of $51.1 million, shocking American and Japanese baseball executives. The Boston Red Sox's winning bid was more than $11 million higher than the next largest. With the negotiations between Matsuzaka and the Red Sox at a stalemate as the negotiation period neared its close, The Washington Post Dave Sheinin questioned both parties' intentions. Sheinin believed that the Red Sox had foreseen the contractual stalemate and had submitted a high bid simply to deny the New York Yankees an opportunity to negotiate with Matsuzaka. However, after Matsuzaka's agent Scott Boras threatened to take Matsuzaka back to NPB if his price was not met, Sheinin theorized that Boras intentionally wanted to hinder contract negotiations. ESPN The Magazine's Tim Kurkjian described the situation as \\"the most obvious game of chicken ever.\\" Sheinin suggested that, should the negotiations fail, Boras could take legal action on the grounds that the requirement of MLB teams to pay large transfer fees to NPB teams artificially depressed the player's personal contract. Boras did not believe that the transfer fee should affect the player's compensation. Despite the negotiation difficulties, the Boston Red Sox eventually signed Matsuzaka. The team paid approximately $103.1 million in total, including the transfer fee and contract, to acquire the pitcher. Kurkjian believes that with fees and contracts this high, small-market teams could not afford to compete with large-market teams for the rights to negotiate with some posted Japanese players. Kurkjian blames the posting system's use of a blind bidding system as the cause of Matsuzaka's \\"outrageous offer.\\" He also postulates that Matsuzaka's high bid amount helped to inflate the bids for Kei Igawa who was posted two weeks later, perpetuating the problem further. After winning the negotiation rights to Igawa, Yankees' general manager Brian Cashman told reporters that \\"the posting system, clearly with what took place this winter, might not necessarily be the best system\\". Kurkjian claims that other MLB executives already believe that a traditional free agent structure, where the highest bidder wins, would be better than the current system. Cashman and Yankees team president Randy Levine met with NPB team officials in early 2007 to discuss the posting system, among other things. These meetings did not result in any immediate changes.

Named after the Yazoo tribe, it was established to provide waterfowl and other migratory birds in the Mississippi Flyway with nesting, feeding, brooding, and resting habitat. The refuge also serves as the headquarters for the Theodore Roosevelt National Wildlife Refuge Complex, and is maintained with an eleven-person staff with a fiscal year 2005 budget of $2,097,000. The refuge office also administers 12,800 acres (51.8 km2) of Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) transfer properties: 42 fee title tracts and 12 easements. A Cooperative farming program provides 3,942 acres (16.0 km2) for local farmers to use. History In the early 1900s, natural habitat supplemented by agricultural crops provided excellent waterfowl hunting in and around the refuge area. Records indicate that ducks, geese and swans were abundant throughout the wintering season. Hunters came from as far away as New England to participate in the sport. Land acquisition began under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act in 1936 with the initial purchase of 2,166 acres (8.77 km2). In March, 1937, an additional 639 acres (2.59 km2) were purchased with plans to acquire 20,000 acres (80 km2). The refuge remained unstaffed from 1936 until 1956. In 1959 the refuge office was built. The Service was given permission to purchase additional land in 1960 under the provision of Section 5928 of the Mississippi Code of 1942, re- compiled by Governor Ross R. Barnett. Various tracts were purchased from individuals and hunting clubs until a total of 12,471 acres (50.5 km2) was reached on July 30, 1969. As land acquisition progressed, habitat management was diversified for mourning doves, wood ducks, Canada geese and colonial wading birds, along with endangered and resident species. A nucleus flock of wild turkey was introduced in 1970. In 1992, the Service purchased the 470 acre (1.9 km2) Cox property bringing total refuge area to 12,941 acres (52.4 km2). Topography Yazoo National Wildlife Refuge's 12,941 acres (52.4 km2) of undulating Delta soils range from heavy clay to silt loam and limited sand ridges (hot spots). Most farm area is classed as prime agricultural land. Elevations range from in the main drainage to in agricultural areas. Yazoo NWR's primary feature is a 4,000+ acre (16 km2) oxbow lake named Swan Lake which formed thousands of years ago when the Mississippi River abandoned a segment of riverbed. In years past, Silver Lake Bayou flowed into the oxbow lake, accelerating the deposit of silt and sediment on the lake bottom, making the lake more shallow. Recently, the Corps of Engineers constructed a new channel to divert silt-laden waters around Swan Lake. Weirs and water control structures maintain water levels in the oxbow lake while the new channel diverts silt-laden flows around the north side of Swan Lake and into Steele Bayou. The Corps project successfully prevents the accelerated build-up of sediment that has reduced water depths in Swan Lake. The past meanderings of the Mississippi River have created a \\"ridge-and-swale\\" topography on the refuge that varies by in elevation. From above sea level in the swamp to on sandy ridges, this mixture of elevations translates into a diversity of habitats for wildlife. Refuge staff have utilized this rolling landscape and through the years have installed 96 water control structures creating over 70 impoundments which have provided a myriad of habitats for migratory waterfowl, colonial wading birds, alligators, and other wildlife. Since 1968, approximately 2,000 acres (8 km2) of marginal agricultural lands have been reforested on Yazoo National Wildlife Refuge. Reforestation has been accomplished by direct-seeding with acorns and with seedling plantings. At least 20 tree species have been planted on refuge lands. These plantations, some of which are among the oldest on record, now provide unique opportunities for researchers to study the development process for the restoration of bottomland hardwoods over time. Reforestation on Yazoo National Wildlife Refuge catalyzed similar habitat restoration on other refuges and private lands throughout the southeast region. Habitats vary from bottomland hardwoods to cypress swamps and agricultural fields. Emphasis is placed on providing food for wintering waterfowl, which utilize the refuge in large numbers, at times exceeding 250,000 birds. These foods consist of corn, milo, rice, wheat, etc. and moist-soil plants. The refuge has over 70 water management units and has restored over 2,000 acres (8 km2) of marginal agricultural land to bottomland hardwoods. Wildlife and protected species Young alligator sunning on a log in Yazoo National Wildlife Refuge A unique opportunity for intensive moist-soil management occurred when the refuge purchased 240 acres (0.97 km2) of abandoned catfish ponds known today as the Cox Ponds. The ponds were reshaped to provide optimal bottom and side slopes, and each pond has its own water control structure and drain. Irrigation wells provide a permanent water source for each pond, giving the refuge broad management options. A rotating cycle of management treatments in these 14 ponds provides habitat for waterfowl, shorebirds, long-legged waders, and other water birds. Some ponds are managed as moist-soil areas while others provide deep water habitat. Frequent visitors to the Cox Ponds include white ibis, glossy ibis, little blue and great blue herons, great egrets, snowy egrets and a wide variety of wintering dabbling and diving ducks. Habitat is provided for southward-bound shorebirds (about 20 species) from July 15 to November. In 2003, the first documented brood of black-bellied whistling ducks in Mississippi was photographed here. In August 2004, as many as thirteen grown ducks plus a brood of eight were observed, indicating an increasing population of this tropical species. The well-established wood duck nest box program produces about 2,000 wood duck hatchlings a year. The boxes are prepared early in the year and checked frequently during nesting season to track hatches and remove non-viable eggs. In addition to waterfowl, the white-tail deer is abundant; hunting is allowed for most native game species except waterfowl. Opportunities for wildlife observation are excellent with good access to a diversity of habitats. The American alligator is a common site in refuge lakes and swamps. The endangered Louisiana black bear are occasionally observed. During fall, winter and spring, numerous visitors travel refuge roads to observe the diverse wildlife which includes white-tailed deer, wild turkey, waterfowl, bobcat, and otter. Facilities The refuge features two wildlife observation areas: * The Holt Collier Boardwalk and Observation Tower is a boardwalk trail leading to an observation platform on Lizard Lake. This area allows viewing of pied-billed grebes, moorhens, wading birds, wood ducks, and American alligators from the safety and comfort of the observation platform. * At Alligator Pond, an open-sided observation tower provides excellent views of alligators, purple gallinules, moorhens, green herons and other wildlife. The all-time-favorite for many visitors is the American alligator. A common resident of the refuge's many sloughs, streams, lakes, and shallow ponds, alligators can often be seen on warm spring days basking on logs or banks, or floating motionless. Common alligator locations are Holt Collier Horseshoe Pond, Alligator Pond, Lizard Lake, Deer Lake, and Alligator Alley. =Hunting and fishing= Yazoo National Wildlife Refuge offers excellent white-tail deer, squirrel, rabbit, and raccoon hunting opportunities. The deer muzzleloader and deer archery hunts are among the most popular hunts in the State. Because Yazoo NWR was established to provide sanctuary for migratory waterfowl, the refuge is closed to duck hunting. ATVs are prohibited on refuge roads and trails; however, all refuge roads are open to foot traffic except where posted. The refuge is closed to fishing due to high levels of pesticides such as DDT and Toxaphene which are found in fish, water and sediment samples taken on the refuge.

This is part of the K-W line. The Koningshooikt‚ÄîWavre Line, abbreviated to KW Line (; ) and often known as the Dyle Line after the Dijle (Dyle) river, was a -long fortified line of defence prepared by the Belgian Army between Koningshooikt (Province of Antwerp) and Wavre (Province of Brabant) which was intended to protect Brussels from a possible German invasion. Construction on the KW Line began in September 1939 after World War II had begun but while Belgium itself remained a neutral state. It was subsequently extended southwards from Wavre towards Namur (Province of Namur). The line itself consisted of bunkers, anti-tank ditches, and barricades including so-called Cointet-elements and played a key role in Allied strategy during the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940. However, its role in the actual fighting was ultimately minimal. In 2009 an inventory of surviving emplacements was begun.www.kwlinie.be  Background  In October 1936, Belgium abandoned its previous military alliance with France, fearful that after the German Remilitarization of the Rhineland, bringing German forces to its borders, it would get involved in a Franco-German war. It was recognised that a policy of neutrality could only be viable if Belgium possessed strong defences. Existing defence plans were therefore pursued more vigorously. A strong defence line was created along the Albert Canal, running eastwards from Antwerp to the modern fortress of Eben Emael and from there to the southwest along the River Meuse. Although this was a powerful position, it had been understood from the outset that Belgium could not resist a major German invasion alone and that despite its neutrality would need to cooperate with the French army to block a German advance. Eben Emael was too close to Germany, and the salient it created was too large, to make it practical for assisting French forces to occupy such a forward position. For this reason a shorter defence line was planned between Antwerp and Namur in the south. This should be the \\"line of main resistance\\", while the Albert Canal-Meuse line would function as a \\"covering line\\", delaying the enemy long enough for allied help to arrive and entrench itself. However, the Belgian government was hesitant to start any large-scale construction along this line as it could be seen by Germany as a breach of neutrality as well as an invitation to occupy the area to the east of it. After the outbreak of the Second World War, Belgium was under considerable pressure from France and the United Kingdom to take their side even before a German invasion, partly because it was feared Belgian defences would collapse before allied troops had the time to reinforce them. To assuage such fears, the Belgian government hastily ordered to improve the Antwerp-Namur position in September 1939. The construction work was largely done by conscripts mobilised in September but also by about a thousand civilian workers hired from private contractors.  Location  The line in the north was anchored on the old fortress belt of Antwerp. This way the existing Fort Broechem, Fort Lier and Fort Koningshooikt could be used. From the latter fort southwards, the line continued to Haacht, protecting the city of Mechelen. From Haacht it ran to Leuven, which city was incorporated into the frontline. Originally, this had not been the case: in this sector between November 1939 and April 1940 the line was shifted to the east four times. The next twenty kilometres, the line followed the course of the River Dyle until Wavre was reached. The area between Koningshooikt and Wavre represented the main position where the Belgian army itself was expected to fight and to the improvement of which most funds were directed. This explains the name Koningshooikt-Wavre line. From February 1940 onwards, the line was extended to the south in the direction of Namur, to close the so-called \\"Gembloux Gap\\" between the Dyle and the Meuse. Also a branch westwards of Wavre was created, running to Waterloo, Halle and Kester, ending in Ninove. This covered the southern approaches of the Belgian capital Brussels. This extension was more symbolic than real, containing only thirty-eight pillboxes, and served to counter German allegations that the K-W line violated Belgian neutrality by being directed against Germany. The western branch pretended to block a possible French advance.  Structure  Pillbox at Wavre, allowing enfilading fire The K-W line was not a massive fortification line with modern forts sheltering the artillery, like the French Maginot Line. There were no permanent fortress garrisons occupying it. In case of war, regular infantry divisions had to entrench themselves along the line after having been withdrawn from the Albert Canal-Meuse covering line. Construction work was aimed at preparing this entrenchment by providing a pre-existing infrastructure, consisting of a telephone network, command bunkers, pillboxes for the machine guns, anti-tank obstacles and inundations. Little was done in the way of digging trenches, placing barbed wire entanglements or laying minefields beforehand. About four hundred concrete pillboxes were constructed. Most of these were placed along a forward line of defence, directly behind main obstacles. To provide some depth, about a kilometre to the west a second line of pillboxes was present. However, when inundations were located in front of the forward line, these were considered to offer enough protection that a second pillbox line could be discarded with. In front of Mechelen, the river Dyle curved to the west. This was seen as an especially vulnerable spot and between the Dyle and the River Nete a third line of pillboxes was constructed covering the eastern approaches of Mechelen. Multiple lines were also present west of Leuven, due to the many changes in the construction plans. The pillboxes were able to withstand hits by the German 15 cm sFH 18, the heaviest howitzer German infantry divisions were equipped with. They were not of a uniform construction; each pillbox was tailored to adapt to the specific terrain conditions of its location, avoiding dead angles and often allowing enfilading fire. To this end they contained up to three chambers in which a single machine gun could be placed. The machine guns were not permanent fixtures; the troops retreating from the covering line were supposed to bring their MG 08s, called \\"Maxims\\", along.

It narrates the emotions of a rejected suitor upon coming to his childhood home, an apparently fictional Locksley Hall, though in fact Tennyson was a guest of the Arundel family in their stately home named Loxley Hall, in Staffordshire, where he spent much of his time writing whilst on his visits. According to Tennyson, the poem represents \\"young life, its good side, its deficiencies, and its yearnings\\".Quoted in Hill. Tennyson's son Hallam recalled that his father said the poem was inspired by Sir William Jones's prose translation of the Arabic Mu'allaqat. Locksley Hall (illustrated) Poetic form Locksley Hall (illustrated) \\"Locksley Hall\\" is a dramatic monologue written as a set of 97 rhyming couplets. Each line follows a modified version of trochaic octameter in which the last unstressed syllable has been eliminated; moreover, there is generally a caesura, whether explicit or implicit, after the first four trochees in the line. Each couplet is separated as its own stanza. The University of Toronto library identifies this form as \\"the old 'fifteener' line,\\" quoting Tennyson, who claimed it was written in trochaics because the father of his friend Arthur Hallam suggested that the English liked the meter.Hill; Rpo.library.utoronto.ca The meter is reminiscent of that of the Nibelungenlied. Plot summary The poem opens with the unnamed protagonist asking his friends to continue ahead and leave him alone to muse about the past and the future. He reveals that the place he has stopped at is called Locksley Hall, and he spent his childhood there. The rest of the poem, though written as rhymed metered verse, follows the stream of consciousness of its protagonist as an interior monologue. The protagonist struggles to reach some sort of catharsis on his childhood feelings. In his monologue, the protagonist begins with fond memories of his childhood sweetheart, but those memories quickly lead to a burst of anger as he relates that the object of his affections abandoned him due to her parents' disapproval. He proceeds to offer a biting criticism of her husband who supplanted him in her affections, interspersed with personal reflection. This criticism is only really interrupted when he reflects that she will eventually have a child, and will be more concerned with her child than about the protagonist. The protagonist promptly continues his angry tirade, this time directed at the mother‚Äìchild relationship. The protagonist seeks escape from his depression by thinking he might immerse himself in some sort of work that would distract him, but finds this impossible, saying: : What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these? : Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys. : Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets overflow. : I have but an angry fancy; what is that which I should do? : I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground, : When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with sound. (lines 99‚Äì104) To be free of his depression, the protagonist continues into a grand description of the world to come, which he views as somewhat utopian. He relapses into anger briefly again when he hears a bugle call from his comrades telling him to hurry up. Tennyson also predicts the rise of both civil aviation and military aviation in the following words: : Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails, : Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales; : Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain‚Äôd a ghastly dew : From the nations‚Äô airy navies grappling in the central blue; In the 20th century, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Slessor was to use Tennyson's expression \\"the central blue\\" as the title for his autobiography. Much of the remainder of the poem is built up of an odd contrast between the beauty of civilisation and the beauty of the noble savage. He recalls the land where he was born (which he only says is somewhere in the Orient), and lovingly notes its lack of civilisation, describing it as \\"Summer isles of Eden\\" and \\"knots of Paradise.\\" In the end, he rejects the ideal of the noble savage, preferring the progress that civilisation has made. He also immediately thereafter turns his back on Locksley Hall, and marches forth to meet his comrades. Main character Tennyson neither identifies the protagonist as a hero nor an anti- hero. The first half of the poem portrays him as a victim, but the second reveals that the protagonist holds views that are now recognised as remarkably racist and sexist; for example: : Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman‚Äôs pleasure, woman‚Äôs pain : Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain: : Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match‚Äôd with mine, : Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine (lines 149‚Äì152) This is contrasted however with Tennyson's known feminist views, making a lot of his similar works a satire on men of the views he wrote about. The narrator is also remarkably emotionally volatile through the poem. A good exampleVictorianweb.org occurs when he reminisces about his love for his cousin Amy; while recalling the wonderful experiences of love, he immediately becomes infuriated with her, even going so far as to throw insults: : Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships, : And our spirits rush‚Äôd together at the touching of the lips. : O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more! : O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore! (lines 37‚Äì40) In the narrator, Tennyson captures and displays many strong emotions‚Äîplacid insightfulness, wonder, love, jealousy, despair, and eventually a sort of catharsis. Tennyson also uses the narrator to speculate on what the world might become: he presents a vision of human advance and conflict, of aerial commerce and combat, resolving in a world of federation, peace, and universal law. As many of these predictions have since been realised, Tennyson's work now seems prescient in many ways. Cultural influence The historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., writing in the Wall Street Journal, quoted the poem to illustrate \\"a noble dream\\" that modern US policy decisions may have been neglecting, and he also stated that Winston Churchill considered it \\"the most wonderful of modern prophecies\\" and Harry S. Truman carried the words in his wallet.Schlesinger, Arthur Jr. \\"Bye, bye, Woodrow.\\" Wall Street Journal. (Eastern edition). New York, N.Y.: 27 October 1993. pg. A16 Lord Tennyson wrote a sequel to Locksley Hall in 1886, \\"Locksley Hall Sixty Years After\\". In the sequel Tennyson describes how the industrialised nature of Britain has failed to fulfil the expectations of the poem of 1842. A line in \\"Locksley Hall\\" would inspire the title of the historian Paul Kennedy's 2006 book on the United Nations, The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations. Locksley Hall was parodied, not without beauty, to the foxhunter at least, by the Victorian English foxhunting MP William Bromley Davenport (1821‚Äì1884) in his poem \\"Lowesby Hall\\", named after a famous hunting seat in Leicestershire, the pre-eminent fox-hunting county. It describes the revived emotion in a jaded and spend-thrift city MP as he recalls the excitement of his youth foxhunting in Leicestershire, and foresees the end of his Victorian aristocratic society: :Can I but regain my credit can I spend spent cash again :Hide me from my deep emotion O thou wonderful champagne :Make me feel the wild pulsation I have often felt before :When my horse went on before me and my hack was at the door later: :Saw the landlords yield their acres after centuries of wrongs :To the Cotton Lords to whom it's proved all property belongs :Queen Religion State abandoned and all flags of party furled :In the government of Cobden and the dotage of the world.Poems of the Chase, collected and recollected by Sir Reginald Graham, Bart.

In a scene from the American film Marathon Man, graduate student Thomas \\"Babe\\" Levy (portrayed by actor Dustin Hoffman) attends an exclusive seminar at Columbia University. During the seminar, his irritable professor, played by Fritz Weaver, quotes the line \\"Let us hush this cry of 'Forward' till ten thousand years have gone\\" from \\"Locksley Hall Sixty Years After\\" and then asks if anyone recognises it. Hoffman's character is the only one who does (he writes down the title in his notes) but does not reveal this to the class. The professor calls him out on this after dismissing the other students. In the television programme Star Trek: Voyager, the dedication plaque of the USS. Voyager quotes from the poem: \\"For I dipt in to the future, far as human eye could see; Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be.\\" Track two of the album Exit by electronic music ensemble Tangerine Dream is called \\"Pilots of Purple Twilight\\" in homage - as discussed in the Wikipedia entry on the band, British poetry was an extramusical source of inspiration, particularly to band leader Edgar Froese. \\"Locksley Hall\\" is also the source of the title of Colum McCann's 2009 novel, Let the Great World Spin. Also, it includes one of the most famous lines in all of English poetry, the last of the following four, albeit very few are aware of the poem whence it came, and it is often, perhaps usually, misquoted: :In the spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast :In the spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest :In the spring a livelier iris changes on the burnished dove :In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love. James Thurber illustrated this poem for Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated. Elizabeth Gaskell mentions the poem in her 1853 novel Cranford. Lines from it are quoted in the 2007 adaptation of the novel.  References  * Hill, Robert W., Jr., ed. (1971). Tennyson's poetry; authoritative texts, juvenilia and early responses, criticism.

Like the closely related Dimetrodon, Sphenacodon was a carnivorous member of the Eupelycosauria family Sphenacodontidae. However, Sphenacodon had a low crest along its back, formed from blade-like bones on its vertebrae (neural spines) instead of the tall dorsal sail found in Dimetrodon. Fossils of Sphenacodon are known from New Mexico and the Utah‚ÄìArizona border region in North America. Researchers currently recognize two species: Sphenacodon ferox (the type species) and Sphenacodon ferocior. Sphenacodon ferocior can be up to 40% larger in overall size (at about long) compared to Sphenacodon ferox (at about ). In addition, the dorsal spines in Sphenacodon ferocior are proportionately 45% taller than in Sphenacodon ferox. The recent discovery of a nearly complete skull of Sphenacodon ferox has helped clarify other distinctions between the two species, including the number of teeth in certain parts of the jaws and the size of the indented notch between the maxillary and premaxillary bones in the upper jaw. The two species occur together in some formations, but Sphenacodon ferox apparently survived later into the Early Permian. Sphenacodon and Dimetrodon typically have been found in different geographical areas that were separated by the ancient Hueco Seaway that penetrated equatorial Pangaea during the Early Permian and \\"covered much of southern New Mexico and parts of West Texas\\". Sphenacodon is known from the west in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, and Dimetrodon is known mainly from the east in Texas and Oklahoma in more deltaic environments. However, the species Dimetrodon occidentalis is found in New Mexico. Each genus would have been an apex land predator in its region and likely preyed on amphibians, diadectids, and early synapsids and diapsids. Sphenacodon appears to have died out before about 280 million years ago during the Wolfcampian. The genus Dimetrodon survived until about 270 million years ago. Such large sphenacodontid predators were later replaced by therapsids, the group of synapsids that includes the direct ancestors of mammals. Description Heavily restored skull of S. ferox in the Field Museum The skull of Sphenacodon is very similar to that of Dimetrodon. It is narrow from side to side and vertically deep, with an indented notch at the front of the maxillary bone in the upper jaw. The upper and lower jaws are equipped with an array of powerful teeth, divided into sharp pointed \\"incisors\\" [precaniniforms], large stabbing \\"canines\\" [caniniforms], and smaller slicing back teeth [postcaniniforms]. The orbit is set high and far back with a single opening (temporal fenestra) behind and partly below the eye, a characteristic of synapsids. Body proportions are also similar to Dimetrodon, with a very large head, short neck, robust trunk, relatively short front and hind limbs, and a tapering tail that makes up about half the animal's entire length. However, the tops of the neural spines along the back bone are strikingly different in each genus. In Dimetrodon, the neural spines develop into long, narrow, cylindrical projections that support a tall vertical dorsal sail that ends near the base of the tail. In Sphenacodon, the neural spines are enlarged but retain a flat-tipped, blade-like shape along the back and tail, and form a crest rather than a tall sail. (The sphenacodontid genus Ctenospondylus also has blade-like neural spines, but its dorsal crest is taller than in Sphenacodon, although not as tall as the sail in Dimetrodon.) There is evidence for strong epaxial muscles along the base of the raised neural spines in both Sphenacodon and Dimetrodon, likely helping to stiffen and strengthen the backbone for walking and for lunging at prey by restricting side-to-side flexing motion. A recent study of the structure of the neural spines on Sphenacodon confirms that the upper parts were not encased in a thick muscular hump and instead protruded above a layer of muscle to form a low dorsal crest. Finds of sphenacodontid specimens in which postmortem distortion of the body caused the dorsal spines to overlap suggests that the spines were not connected by hard or particularly tough tissue. The possible function of a low, skin-covered crest in Sphenacodon is debated. A thermoregulatory role seems unlikely, although the taller crest in Sphenacodon ferocior is allometrically larger than in S. ferox. Recent research has favored a display role for the tall sails in Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus. S. ferox and the larger S. ferocior Both Sphenacodon and Dimetrodon have been depicted with their short limbs splayed outward at 90 degrees from the body in a wide pushup position and with the tail (and even belly) dragging on the ground, similar to modern lizards and crocodiles. A sprawling stance is also typical for Sphenacodon and Dimetrodon skeletons as currently mounted in museums. However, trackways called Dimetropus (\\"Dimetrodon foot\\") that match the foot configuration of large sphenacodontids show animals walking with their limbs brought under the body for a narrow, semi-erect gait without tail or belly drag marks. Such clear evidence for a more efficient upright posture suggests that important details about the anatomy and locomotion of Sphenacodon and Dimetrodon may not be fully understood. Some well preserved narrow Dimetropus tracks found in parts of the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument in New Mexico match the smaller size of Sphenacodon, a genus known from skeletal fossils in the state, but could also come from a small Dimetrodon. Discovery and classification Restoration of two specimens The American paleontologist O. C. Marsh named Sphenacodon (from Greek ' \\"wedge\\" + ' \\"point\\" + ' (-odon) \\"tooth\\") in 1878, based on part of a lower jaw (dentary) bone found in the redbeds of northern New Mexico by fossil collector David Baldwin. In his very short description of the jaw, Marsh cited the back teeth as characteristic (\\"crowns are much compressed, and have very sharp cutting edges without crenulations\\") and assessed the animal as \\"about six feet in length, and carnivorous in habit,\\" although the rest of the skeleton was not known. He did not provide an illustration of the specimen. Marsh gave the genus the Latin specific name ferox \\"fierce\\" and erected the new family Sphenacodontidae, placed under the primitive reptilian order \\"Rhynchocephala\\" (=Rhynchocephalia), then including nearly all groups of early reptiles in addition to the living tuatara. Other paleontologists overlooked Marsh's brief mention of Sphenacodon for almost three decades. In the meantime, the sail- backed Dimetrodon, named in 1878 by rival paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, became a scientifically important genus, known from numerous fossils. Recognition of Sphenacodon as a low-spined carnivorous \\"pelycosaur\\" distinct from Dimetrodon came in the early 20th century with the discovery of more fossils in New Mexico. The proposed taxa Elcabrosaurus baldwini Case, 1907 and Scoliomus Williston and Case, 1913 now are considered junior synonyms of Sphenacodon ferox. In 1937, Alfred Sherwood Romer described a second species from New Mexico named Sphenacodon ferocior (\\"fiercer\\") that was larger and more robust, with proportionately longer neural spines. Romer and Price (1940) provided detailed descriptions of both ferox and ferocior with skeletal reconstructions. A third species, Sphenacodon britannicus, has sometimes been cited in the literature. In 1908 German paleontologist F. von Huene described Oxyodon britannicus, based on part of a maxilla found in England, (The generic name Oxyodon is preoccupied by a fish (Oxyodon Baur, 1906) and so is invalid.) The specimen had been identified earlier as a possible Triassic dinosaur, but von Huene recognized a \\"pelycosaur.\\" Paton transferred the species to Sphenacodon in 1974, noting it would have been an animal about the size of Sphenacodon ferox. However, more recent studies have questioned whether such limited fossil material can be used to distinguish between Dimetrodon and Sphenacodon‚Äîor its own genus. The species \\"Oxyodon\\" britannicus (or as Sphenacodon (?) britannicus) is now generally classified as Sphenacodontidae incertae sedis (of uncertain placement).

He became the mayor of Aurora, Illinois, beginning in April 2005. Prior to his election he worked for over eighteen years in high-ranking positions in the city of Aurora and for five years as a volunteer in the Peace Corps. Weisner was re-elected twice, in 2009 and 2013, serving as mayor until his resignation on October 30, 2016, due to his declining health. He had been diagnosed with cancer two years into his first of three terms as mayor. He died of cancer- related complications on December 28, 2018. Background Weisner was a native of Batavia, Illinois, but moved to Aurora thirty years before becoming a political candidate. Weisner had been married to Marilyn Hogan Weisner since 1972. The Weisners raised two sons; Thaddeus, who died in 2006, and Anthony. Weisner earned his bachelor's degree from Aurora University in organizational management. Prior to becoming an Aurora city employee in 1986, Weisner worked in the private sector and spent five years in the Solomon Islands, where he gave medical services and other assistance to natives with the Peace Corps and International Human Assistance Program. He and his wife were stationed in rain forests on the Island of Guadalcanal. Weisner had held several department head positions in Aurora since beginning his first position as emergency service coordinator in January 1986. By fall 1987, Weisner had become the superintendent of the Aurora Department of Motor Vehicles. He later served as the director of equipment services for Aurora and was subsequently appointed Aurora's director of public property in a 1991 city hall reorganization. In 1999, he was appointed Aurora's director of community services and organizational development, which was his last position before running for public office. He resigned from this position in February 2004 during the city's water contamination crisis. The city's residents were under a boil water order at the time of his resignation. The order to boil drinking water contaminated with E. coli bacteria lasted for ten days. Weisner served as a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Campaign In November 2002, two-term incumbent David Stover announced he would not seek re-election. In May 2003, Weisner announced he would run for election in the February 22, 2005 municipal primary election. Weisner announced his candidacy for mayor almost two years before the election, in order to solidify his base of support, which might have gone to other potential candidates if he waited. Eventually, a final field of five contested for the two spots on the ballot for the April 5, 2005 general election, but Weisner had endorsements from eight of the twelve city council members and a huge funding advantage. In the first Aurora mayoral race without an incumbent in twenty years, Democrat Weisner garnered 60% of the vote and Republican Richard Irvin finished second with 33% to advance to the general election. Irvin was the only African- American in the race. Weisner won eight of the city's 10 wards and nearly two- thirds of its precincts. When Barack Obama visited Aurora on February 25 for his 10th town hall meeting after his 2004 United States Senate election in Illinois, he noted that as a Democrat he was inclined to support Weisner, but he made no endorsement. However, in the final days before the general election, Obama returned to endorse Weisner. The day after the election, the Chicago Tribune reported Weisner took 59% of the vote, and the Chicago Sun- Times reported that he took 68%. When the results were finally tabulated in Aurora, which spans four counties, the Tribune turned out to be correct. Weisner took the oath of office on April 26, 2005. Mayor During the first few weeks of his tenure as mayor, he made national news by considering passing an ordinance against untimely holiday decorations, when citizens complained of Christmas decorations abounding during the summer. At about the same time in June 2005, he was considering proposing a strict whistleblower protection ordinance in response to an alderman bribery scandal. In July 2007, first-term Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher visited Weisner and took footage of the Hollywood Casino of Aurora. In August, when Fletcher's re-election ad campaign began airing on television in Kentucky, journalists began calling Weisner's office about the ads which used the footage as a backdrop for a message regarding the evils and temptations casinos bring into communities. The footage was included in the very first ads that Fletcher aired and the Kentucky press noted that Aurora City Hall was not pleased with the usage. One Kentucky journalist referred to the Aurora casino as the \\"unnamed villain\\" in Fletcher's anti-gambling ads. One of Weisner's major initiatives was to make Aurora the first city in Illinois to construct a complete wireless Internet infrastructure. In January 2008 while it was in the middle of installing the city's Wi-Fi network, MetroFi switched from an advertising-based model to a subscription-based business model and suspended construction. MetroFi had also contracted to install a network for Naperville, Illinois and attempted to sell partially installed networks to both cities. In June 2008, Metrofi shut down all its wifi operations across the nation. In early March 2008, two Aurora City Council Aldermen announced their candidacies for mayor. In May 2008, Weisner announced his intentions to run for re-election in the non-partisan February 24, 2009 primary election after the two challengers announced. In the shadow of the Rod Blagojevich corruption scandal, his campaign has since been criticized by his opponents for accepting contributions from businesses that the city awarded contracts to. Weisner was re-elected on April 7, 2009. He ran unopposed for re-election on April 9, 2013. On May 8, 2015, Weisner announced that he would not seek a fourth term. Resignation and death Weisner was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2007. On August 25, 2016, Weisner announced his intention to step down as mayor, effective October 30, 2016. He cited health (cancer treatment) as the main reason for stepping down. He was succeeded by Alderman Bob O'Connor. Weisner died of cancer-related complications on December 28, 2018. He was 69.

Its fossils are common in European shales. Inside its flippers were finger bones that did not stick out. Halitherium also had the residues of back legs, which did not show externally. However, it did have a basic femur, joined to a reduced pelvis. Halitherium also had elongated ribs, presumably to increase lung capacity to provide fine control of buoyancy. A 2014 review presented the opinion that the genus is dubious.  Classification  Halitherium is the type genus of the subfamily Halitheriinae, which includes the well-known genera Eosiren and Eotheroides and lived from the Eocene to the Oligocene.D. P. Domning. 1996. Bibliography and Index of the Sirenia and Desmostylia.

Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 44(2):122-125 It was originally coined by Johann Jakob Kaup on the basis of a premolar from the early Oligocene (Rupelian) of southern Germany, but Kaup himself mistakenly stated that the premolar, in his opinion, gehort zu Hippopotamus dubius Cuv., unaware that H. dubius is actually a junior synonym of the primitive sirenian Protosiren minima, while simultaneously coining the genus and species name Pugmeodon schinzii for the same specimen.Kaup, J.J., 1838. [tJber Zahnen von Halytherium and Pugmeodon aus Fionheim.] Neues Jahrbuchfiir Mineralogie, Geologic und Paldontologie, 1838: 318-320. For his part, the renowned German paleontologist Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer included the type specimen of Halitherium schinzii in his composite species Halianassa studeri,Meyer, H. von. 1838. [Letter to H. G. Bronn.] Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Mineralogie. Geologic und Pal√§ontologie, 1838: 667-669. whose hypodigm also included the type specimens of Metaxytherium medium and Protosiren minima as well as a Miocene-age maxilla and a skeleton from the molasse basin in Switzerland.Studer, T. 1887.

Memoires de la Societe du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Strasbourg, 2 Mem. GG: 1-12. Later, Kaup synonymized Pugmeodon with Halitherium creating the new combination Halitherium schinzii, and the name Halitherium became universally accepted for the early Oligocene halitheriine material from Europe.Kaup,J.J., 1855. Beitraege zur naeherenKenntnissderurweltlichenSaeugethiere, vol. 2, 1-23pp. Darmstadt. Because Halitherium was originally based on a misidentified type species and due to the widespread use of Halitherium, the sirenian specialist Daryl Domning petitioned the ICZN to designate Pugmeodon schinzii as the type species of Halitherium, and the proposal was approved by the Commission in 1989, effectively making Pugmeodon a junior objective synonym of Halitherium in line with the current concept of Halitherium introduced by Kaup himself.Domning, Daryl, 1987. Halianassa studeri von Meyer, 1838 (Mammalia, Sirenia): proposed designation of a neotype, and proposed conservation of Halitherium Kaup, 1838 by designation of a type species. Bull. Zool.

Opinion 1535: Halianassa studeri von Meyer, 1838 (Mammalia, Sirenia): neotype designated; and Halitherium Kaup, 1838 (Mammalia, Sirenia): Pugmeodon schinzii Kaup, 1838 designated as the type species. Bull. Zool. Nomencl. 46(1): 83-84. Voss (2013, 2014) dismisses Halitherium as a nomen dubium by virtue of being based on non-diagnostic remains. Voss based the opinion on the type species, H. schinzii, being nomen dubium, with its holotype fossil, an isolated molar, having no diagnostic value.Voss, Manja. \\"On the invalidity of Halitherium schinzii Kaup, 1838 (Mammalia, Sirenia), with comments on systematic consequences.\\" Zoosystematics and Evolution 90 (2014): 87. and a 2017 study found specimens traditionally assigned to Halitherium schinzii to be two separate species, one of which takes the name Halitherium bronni Krauss, 1858.

After releasing two studio albums they split up in 1993. History The band formed in Rugby in 1989 and was led by Pete Bain (aka Bassman), who had left Spacemen 3 just before their 1989 album Playing With Fire. Bain was then joined in the new outfit by his former bandmate, drummer Sterling Roswell (aka Rosco). Vocals were initially handled by Nick Haydn but his departure forced Bain to assume them. The group were signed to Beggars Banquet Records offshoot Situation Two throughout their existence.Darkside - Music Biography, Credits and Discography : AllMusic Contrary to much of what is written about the band, Haydn has always claimed he was a founder member, once played with Spacemen 3 himself and wrote most of the band's early material (although credited to 'The Darkside' on record labels), and also played guitar as well as being the lead vocalist. Hayden left the band shortly before he was due to go on stage at a gig in Oxford. Hayden then formed the Oxford band Flite 118 whose set list included much of the early The Darkside songs such as \\"Highrise Love\\", \\"Ocean of Fire\\" and \\"Can't Think Straight\\". The group debuted in April 1990 with the single \\"Highrise Love\\", which was followed by \\"Waiting for the Angels\\" and the album, All That Noise. With Rosco moving to keyboards, the group recruited Craig Wagstaff, whom they had known while in Spacemen 3. The band's next release was the mail-order only Psychedelicise Suburbia live album in 1991. A double-EP in November 1991 preceded second studio album Melomania, which was released in January 1992. With the departure of guitarist Kevin Cowen following the LP's release, Bain then assumed guitar duties for the EP Mayhem to Meditate. When Situation Two rejected the demos cut for a third LP, the band disintegrated. Since the band's split, Bain has recorded several albums under the Alpha Stone name and guested on several of former bandmate Peter Kember's E.A.R albums. Rosco has issued the solo album Ubik under his assumed name Sterling Roswell.

He played collegiately at Penn State University and attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, Maryland. Football Rice signed as a free agent with the Buffalo Bills shortly after the 2006 NFL draft. He was released from the team June 9, 2006, and signed with the St. Louis Rams 2 weeks later , only to be released despite a productive preseason. He worked out for several teams during the 2006 season, and was eventually signed mid- season by the New York Giants. The start of the 2007 preseason found Rice with the Detroit Lions organization, allocated to the Rhein Fire of NFL Europa. The 6'4\\", 256-pound Rice was a three-year starter and a second team All-Big Ten selection at Penn State. He helped the Nittany Lions rank as the conference's top defense in 2005, and made 9 sacks and 147 tackles. He was chosen to play in the 2006 Hula Bowl. An accomplished painter and illustrator, Rice earned dual degrees from Penn State University in 2005: a Bachelor of Arts in integrative arts, along with a Bachelor of Arts in African-American studies. Personal life Between workouts as out as a possible 2006 mid-season replacement for the Kansas City Chiefs, Jacksonville Jaguars, and New York Giants, Rice concentrated on establishing a new business, Mateo Blu. The company publishes limited-edition art prints with proceeds going to charitable causes. Rice began having seizures in August 2007. CAT scans and MRIs identified a tumor on the right frontal lobe of his brain‚Äîironically, the section from which artistic abilities are derived. The tumor was determined to be benign, but surgery became necessary following a second seizure. The surgery, performed at Johns Hopkins University, was successful. The tumor was limited to the surface of the brain, and was removed without damage to Rice's brain. Afterward, Rice was told, instead of a potential loss of his artistic talents, the removal of the tumor might actually allow his talents to develop more fully. During the surgery, reinforcements were placed in Rice's skull, allowing for the possibility of playing football again.

Fossils of Secodontosaurus have been found in Texas in North America in the Wichita and the Clear Fork groups of Early Permian formations.

These discoveries are mentioned in online blogs Dig Into the Past, Dispatches From South Dakota: Willie The Dimetrodon [Day 2], 12 October 2011 http://blog.hmns.org/2011/10/dispatches-from-south-dakota-willie-the- dimetrodon-day-2/Robert Bakker, Secodontosaurus: The \\"Fox-Faced Finback\\" Prehistoric CSI, 26 October 2007 http://hmnspaleo.blogspot.com/2007/10/secodontosaurus-fox-faced-finback.html but so far have not been formally described. The name Secodontosaurus comes from Latin ('to cut') + Greek , (, , 'tooth') + Greek (, 'lizard') and is based on the anatomical term \\"secodont\\" for teeth with cutting edges designed to tear or slice flesh. Paleontologist Robert Bakker has dubbed Secodontosaurus the \\"fox-faced finback\\" after its long jaws. Description A number of partial fossil remains of Secodontosaurus have been identified from its characteristic long skull and jaws. The postcranial skeletal material from different individuals includes parts of the backbone with clear evidence of a tall sail very similar to that of Dimetrodon. The limbs and tail are incomplete but probably resembled those of Dimetrodon as well. Like Dimetrodon, Secodontosaurus would have had a short neck, robust body, short limbs, and a long tail. In light of such similarities, some skeletal remains with missing or fragmentary skulls that were previously identified as Dimetrodon may in fact belong to Secodontosaurus. A key noncranial difference can be found in the axis neck vertebra, which has a tall and broad neural spine in Dimetrodon but has a lower neural spine in Secodontosaurus. S. obtusidens head Robert R. Reisz and others described the skull in detail in 1992, based mostly on a nearly complete skull specimen (MCZ 1124) about long, preserved with a left mandible. In addition to the long, low skull and nearly uniform size of the teeth that contrast with Dimetrodon, the anterior teeth of the upper jaw are slanted back and those of the lower jaw are directed forward for grasping prey. Its rather crocodile-like skull suggests that Secodontosaurus could have been semi-aquatic and may have fed on fish and small swimming amphibians. However, Reisz and his coauthors noted that a tall sail would seem to be a hindrance in pursuit of quick-moving creatures underwater. Instead, the long, narrow snout with forward slanting teeth at the mandible tip might have allowed Secodontosaurus to probe after small animals hiding in burrows and other tight spaces. Discovery and classification The American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope published the first description of Secodontosaurus material in 1880 as a supposed species of his genus Theropleura (\\"mammal rib\\"). Theropleura Cope, 1878 is a junior synonym of Ophiacodon Marsh, 1878 (\\"snake point tooth\\"). The specimen, AMNH 4007 collected by Jacob Boll, was actually a composite that included bones of \\"amphibians\\" and a sphenacodontid. Cope described the teeth as having \\"apices are not very acute. The superficial coating is striate with fifteen or sixteen rather obtuse ridges\\"‚Äîfeatures expressed in the species name Theropleura obtusidens (Latin for \\"obtuse tooth\\" or \\"blunt-toothed\\"). E. C. Case described another specimen of Secodontosaurus, AMNH 4091, as Dimetrodon longiramus [\\"long (lower jaw) ramus\\"] in 1907. In 1916 S. W. Williston illustrated parts of the upper and lower jaws of a new, then unnamed genus, specimen FMNH (WM) 573, that he took for a member of the ophiacodontids, noting, however, its \\"broader, flattened, and cutting teeth\\" compared to Ophiacodon, which has mainly pointed conical teeth. In his 1925 Osteology of the Reptiles, Williston listed the name Secodontosaurus under the Ophiacodontidae, presumably as the new genus from 1916, but did not provide a description or an explanation. Williston likely chose the name Secodontosaurus \\"cutting-tooth lizard\\" for flat, sharp-edged [\\"secodont\\"] teeth that contrasted with the conical teeth typically found in ophiacodontids. In 1936 A. S. Romer made Williston's proposed generic name official but identified Secodontosaurus as a sphenacodontid related to Dimetrodon instead of an ophiacodontid. He also chose Case's Dimetrodon longiramus as the type species and erected the new species S. willistoni from the Clear Fork group, noting its later occurrence and larger size. In 1940 Romer and Price gave priority to Cope's species obtusidens over the synonym longiramus. When Reisz and others redescribed the skull and reviewed other known material for Secodontosaurus in 1992, they also made the species S. willistoni from the later Clear Fork group a junior synonym of Cope's obtusidens, although this species is sometimes retained as distinct in other sources. Evolutionary relationship to Dimetrodon Determining exactly how the members of the Sphenacodontidae‚ÄîDimetrodon, Sphenacodon, Ctenospondylus, Cryptovenator, and Secodontosaurus‚Äîare related to each other has posed an evolutionary puzzle for paleontologists. Dimetrodon and Secodontosaurus have very similar postcranial skeletons, with a tall dorsal sail supported by thin, rodlike cylindrical neural spines. By contrast, Sphenacodon and Ctenospondylus have a lower dorsal crest formed from flat, blade-like neural spines, relatively low in Sphenacodon and taller in Ctenospondylus. However, Dimetrodon, Sphenacodon, and Ctenospondylus have very similar deep skulls with teeth of different sizes while Secondontosaurus has an unusual low, elongated skull with more uniform teeth. Depending on whether the tall dorsal sail or the deep skull is considered the key character in the phylogeny of sphenacodontids, Secodontosaurus is either in a clade with Dimetrodon that excludes Sphenacodon or is placed on a distinct branch of its own with Dimetrodon and Sphenacodon united in a separate clade. In one evolutionary scenario, the tall-sailed Secodontosaurus would have evolved a specialized elongated narrow skull from the deep skull found in a tall-sailed common ancestor that it would have shared with the equally tall-sailed Dimetrodon. The deep-skulled‚Äîbut low- crested‚ÄîSphenacodon would be outside the Secodontosaurus-Dimetrodon clade and would retain characteristics of an earlier stage of sphenacodontid evolution before a tall, thin-spined dorsal sail evolved. Alternative scenarios in which Dimetrodon, Sphenacodon, and Ctenospondylus are united in a deep-skulled clade (Sphenacodontinae) that excludes Secodontosaurus require that either (1) tall, rod-like neural spines are plesiomorphic in the Sphenacodontidae so that the common ancestor of all four genera had a tall dorsal sail that was retained in Secodontosaurus and in Dimetrodon, but was lost by character reversal in Sphenacodon, or (2) the common ancestor of all four genera lacked a tall dorsal sail (and so more closely resembled Sphenacodon), in which case both Secodontosaurus and Dimetrodon would have evolved their very similar-looking tall sails completely independently as an apomorphy. Most recent analyses favor a monophyletic group Sphenacodontinae composed of Dimetrodon, Sphenacodon, and Ctenospondylus, based mainly on shared characters in the skull and the mandible. According to these phylogenetic hypotheses, the long- skulled Secodontosaurus represents a separate branch at the base of the Sphenacodontidae. More complete fossils of early sphenacodontids such as Cryptovenator (currently known only from jaw material) and other forms from the Late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) could help clarify the evolution of the group, and how many times and at what evolutionary stage sails developed.

History The Ridings High School was founded in 1957 and opened by the eminent Labour politician, Tony Benn. =Academy proposal= In 2007, Rob Gibson (Headteacher at the time) was invited by the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) to consider a move to Academy status as the Lead (non-financial) sponsor in a Hard Federation, incorporating King Edmund Community School in Yate. As a result, in September 2009, The Ridings' Federation of Academies was established with two independent academies, Winterbourne International Academy (formerly 'The Ridings High School' and the lead sponsor) and Yate International Academy (formerly King Edmund Community School). The two academies have since parted ways, and now operate under separate trusts. Rob Gibson became the Chief Executive Principal in 2009 of the Federation but left at the end of 2014. Beverley Martin became Chief Executive Principal of the Federation in 2015 and Principal of Yate International Academy. The Winterbourne Academy has approximately 1,820 students on roll including 370 in its sixth form. Winterbourne Academy used to base its curriculum models upon the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme. The Winterbourne International Academy delivered the International Baccalaureate Diploma (post-16). International Baccalaureate results were consistently above the International benchmark pass rate of 80%. Since 2008, The Winterbourne International Academy has had three students awarded the prestigious Prime Minister's Global Fellowship: students have used these awards to travel to China and Brazil. Following major changes at the academy, the International Baccalaureate Diploma was dropped, and thus Winterbourne International Academy became solely Winterbourne Academy. The Principal of Winterbourne Mr Rob Evans announced that he was going to be resigning in 2015. Mr Richard Haupt took his place of Principal on 1 June 2015. In September 2018 Jason Beardmore became the new principal, taking over from Peter Smart who had been interim headteacher since 2017 Academic standards The school (and now Academy) has expanded since its inception, providing services such as a technology college, Arts Centre and Sixth Form. Since 2006 it has offered the International Baccalaureate, becoming the first school in South Gloucestershire to offer this qualification, and even attracting students from abroad. It hosts the most popular Sixth Form in the county, with children joining at the age of 16 from all of the other local secondary schools.

It blocks the release of noradrenaline from nerve terminals. In effect, it decreases output from the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. It also acts by blocking K+ channels and is considered a class III antiarrhythmic. The dose is 5‚Äì10 mg/kg and side effects are high blood pressure followed by low blood pressure and ventricular ectopy. Originally introduced in 1959 for the treatment of hypertension. Its use as an antiarrhythmic for ventricular fibrillation was discovered and patented by Marvin Bacaner in 1969 at the University of Minnesota. The American Heart Association removed bretylium from their 2000 ECC/ACC guidelines due to its unproven efficacy and ongoing supply problems. Many have cited these supply problems as an issue of raw materials needed in the production of Bretylium. By the release of the AHA 2005 ECC/ACC guidelines there is no mention of Bretylium and it is virtually unavailable throughout most of the world. On June 8, 2011 bretylium tosylate was announced as unavailable in the US after request of Hospira Inc. to withdraw its NDA from the market. Bretylium will remain on the FDA's discontinued drug list since its withdrawal was not the result of a safety or effectiveness concern. In mid 2019, it was reintroduced. Uses The drug was used in emergency medicine, cardiology, and other specialties throughout the 1980s-1990s for the acute management of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation refractory to other first line treatments such as defibrillation or lidocaine. It is contraindicated in patients with AV (atrioventricular) heart block or digoxin toxicity. Bretylium should be used only in an ICU or Emergency Department setting and should not be used elsewhere due to its dramatic actions and its predominant side effect of hypotension. Experimental uses It is used in physiological and pharmacological research as an inhibitor of sympathetic transmission. Its mechanism of action is the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerve terminals, both by the inhibition of action potentials in the nerve terminals and by other mechanisms. Its specificity for sympathetic nerves is achieved because it is a substrate for the noradrenaline transporter; hence, it accumulates inside nerve terminals which have this transporter.

Johns and where Biggles also travels to the 1980s to save his new friend. The film stars Neil Dickson, Alex Hyde- White, and Peter Cushing in his final feature film role. Plot Catering salesman Jim Ferguson (Alex Hyde-White), living in present-day New York City, falls through a time hole to 1917 where he saves the life of dashing Royal Flying Corps pilot James \\"Biggles\\" Bigglesworth (Neil Dickson) after his photo recon mission is shot down. Before he can work out what has happened, Jim is zapped back to the 1980s. With assistance from Biggles' former commanding officer William Raymond (Peter Cushing) who lives in the Tower Bridge in London, Ferguson learns that he and Biggles are \\"time twins\\", spontaneously travelling through time when one or the other is in mortal danger. Together, Ferguson and Biggles fight across time and against the odds to stop the Germans changing the course of history by destroying a \\"Sound Weapon\\" with a Metropolitan Police helicopter that was stolen by Biggles while escaping a SWAT Team in 1986 London.

Johns' books entitled Biggles Sweeps The Skies scripted by Chris Bryant to be filmed in Algeria and financed by Universal Pictures. Pre-production work was completed, including building replica period aircraft. James Fox was tapped to play Biggles and even appeared in promotional material. However, the film was cancelled due to budgetary and location problems. Peter James bought the rights to the Biggles stories in 1976 but the film remained in development hell for several years.Decline and fall of the funny film The Observer 8 Feb 1976: 32 The film was produced by Yellowbill Films. John Hough had already directed several movies for Hammer Films and Walt Disney Productions in the United States, and had had box office hits with Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry and Escape to Witch Mountain. He had read the Biggles books as a child and was available after a deal to direct a James Bond film fell through. He was attracted by the unconventional story and signed to direct in November 1984. =Writing= Early versions of the script were written by Michael Fallon and called for an adventure film in the mould of Raiders of the Lost Ark.https://www.yourprops.com/Original-Production-Used-Script-original- production-material-Biggles-1986-YP66134.html The original story would have been much more faithful to Johns' original novels. Some sources claim that during scriptwriting, however, Back to the Future was released and became a major hit, so the script was duly altered by Walwin and John Groves to follow this trend, in an attempt to capitalise on Back to the Future's popularity. However, Biggles had already completed filming by the date of Back to the Future's UK release date of December 1985. The film takes much liberty with the storyline of the original novels. In addition to the introduction of a science-fiction plot, Biggles is much older than in the books (where he is only a teenager in 1917), and the characters Ginger and Bertie feature although they don't join Biggles until much later in the book series. However, the presence of Biggles' friend Algy, adversary Erich von Stahlein and love interest Marie fits with the earlier books in the series.Biggles Fansite: A history of Biggles on film Re-linked 2015-06-12 The sound weapon appears to be based on a real life sonic device that the Nazis were working on during the Second World War. It used a reflector to transmit high energy sound waves. =Filming= Principal photography took place over six weeks between January and March 1985. Before Neil Dickson was cast, Dudley Moore and Jeremy Irons were considered to play Biggles. The film was both Dickson's and Hyde-White's first leading role in a motion picture. It was also Fiona Hutchison's first movie role. She described her character Debbie as 'trapped and terrified.' To play Biggles' rival von Stahlein, Marcus Gilbert researched German WWI fighter aces, especially Manfred von Richthofen. At one point, he can be seen wearing a Blue Max medallion. Veteran stuntman Gerry Crampton coordinated the action sequences and designed the stunts for the film, while second unit director Terry Coles, who had done similar work on Battle of Britain was in charge of filming the aerial sequences. The film includes a scene where Biggles lands a helicopter (a Bell 206 JetRanger) on a flat wagon on a moving train. This was filmed on the Nene Valley Railway and was apparently the first time such a stunt had been attempted. Fifteen takes were needed before the director was satisfied that the sequence was finished. The helicopter was flown by renowned stunt pilot Marc Wolff. The Sopwith Pup which crashes near the start of the film was specially built by Skysport Engineering. The crash was unplanned and the scene was rewritten to work around this. =Locations= The film was mostly shot in London and on various locations in the home counties. Tower Bridge and the surrounding area was extensively used, including the Tower Hotel which doubled as the film crew's base of operations.https://www.thelondonstoryteller.com/before-bond-there-was-biggles/ Some of the aerial sequences were shot near Millbrook Proving Ground in Bedfordshire. The 1917 weapon testing ground scene was shot at the Beckton Gas Works, which a year later was used for scenes in Full Metal Jacket and had been the location for the pre title sequence in the 1981 Bond film For Your Eyes Only and the finale of the John Wayne actioner Brannigan. The weapon itself was a custom made fibreglass dish mounted on a mobile crane. It was filmed at the former London Brick Company works near Brogborough in Bedfordshire, as were the trench scenes. The site is now a landfill and recycling centre owned by FCC Environment. The exterior church scenes were all filmed at All Saints Church, Holdenby, and the courtyard scenes were filmed by the stable blocks of Holdenby House. =Aircraft= Several aircraft were used in the film. These included a Stampe SV.4, which is flown by Biggles, and a Boeing Stearman, which is flown by his archrival, von Stalhein. Both these bi- planes are actually from the 1930s as flying and maintaining actual WWI aircraft was considered prohibitively expensive. The period aircraft seen on the background during ground scenes belonged to the Shuttleworth Collection. The Stampe was flown by Stuart Goldspink while the Stearman was piloted by former WWII bomber pilot John Jordan. The Stampe was later seen in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Reception Biggles received a royal charity premiere on Thursday 22 May 1986 at the Plaza Cinema on Lower Regent Street in London.The Theatres Trust Theatre Database: Plaza Cinema Linked 2015-06-13 The film went on general release in the UK on Friday 23 May 1986The Times, Saturday 17 May 1986, page 18: Films: Biggles - Plaza - From Friday Linked 2015-06-13 To promote the release of the film, the story was published in newspapers in comic strip form and promoted via ABC Cinemas with discounted tickets available. When released in the USA on 29 January 1988, Variety was more positive, praising the action scenes and Dickson's performance especially. Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times found the film enjoyable in parts, but overall disappointing. The film was not a success at the box office. John Hough observed that the film got into profit later through television repeats and video sales. In 2000, a new film entitled Biggles Flies North was announced after the rights to the character and books had been sold on with a prospective shooting date of 2001 and locations filmed in Malaysia. , nothing has materialised. Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed by Stanislas Syrewicz and released by MCA Records on vinyl and cassette tape. Jon Anderson, frontman of Yes wrote the lyrics for the film's signature song, Do You Want to Be a Hero? as well as Chocks Away, while Stanislas composed the rhythm. Anderson and Stanislas were both signed to Island Records at the time and had agreed to collaborate on the music.https://www.keepmovingrecords.com/product/stranded/ Just like the film, the soundtrack drew mixed reviews because of its experimental themes which seemed out of place in a period adventure and heavy use of synthesizers. =Track listing= Jon Anderson ‚Äì \\"Do You Want to Be a Hero?\\" Jon Anderson ‚Äì \\"Chocks Away\\" Deep Purple ‚Äì \\"Knocking at Your Back Door\\" M√∂tley Cr√ºe ‚Äì \\"Knock 'Em Dead, Kid\\" Queen - \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" The Immortals ‚Äì \\"No Turning Back\\" Co-written by John Deacon in his second non- Queen recording. Deacon was asked by John Hough to compose a song for the film after meeting him shortly after Live Aid. The track was released as a single, and the accompanying music video also starred Peter Cushing in his very last on-screen appearance. The song failed to chart. Video game As a tie-in to the film, a video game with the same title was released in 1986 by Image Works for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.World Of Spectrum: Biggles Re-linked 2015-06-12 The game was based on the movie's storyline and featured four different missions which including flying combat sequences with biplanes, a rooftop chase, searching for the secret weapon in a trench setting and first person helicopter gameplay. The game received mixed reviews. Reception Colin Greenland reviewed Biggles for White Dwarf #77, and stated that \\"in a silly story about the Germans developing a sonic weapon in 1917 and threatening history as we know it.

This story was first published in the Desh magazine in 1970 and then published in book form in 1971 by Ananda Publishers. Plot Feluda and Topshe travel to Gangtok for their summer holidays on the starting of the Bengali New Year. While eating breakfast at the Bagdogra Airport, they meet a man named Sasadhar Bose, who works for a chemical firm dealing with aromatic perfumes. He tells that he had attended a nephew's wedding in Ghatshila and had come to Sikkim. While stopping at a place called Teesta Bazaar, the trio comes to know about an accident which took place in the North Sikkim Highway. They learn that a huge boulder crashed on the taxi and the taxi fell off a cliff. But the driver escaped unhurt. Feluda and Topshe is staying at Hotel Snow View while Sasadhar Bose is staying at the dak bungalow. In the evening, Sasadhar Bose comes to Feluda's hotel and informs him that the man who fell down the cliff in the accident, was his partner Shivkumar Shelvankar, who was also the owner of the company. Sasadhar Bose walks out of the hotel to find a flight to Bombay the next day. Feluda meets another Bengali in the hotel, Nishikanto Sarkar. He reveals that he had a statue of a Tibetan God named Yamantak, which had nine heads and 34 hands. He says that he had sold the statue to Shelvankar for a 1000 rupees. While walking on the road, they meet a German hippie, Helmut Ungar, who tells them more about Shelvankar. He tells them that he had a son, whom he loved. But the son ran away from his father. Helmut tells Feluda that on the day of the accident, Mr. Shelvankar and he had decided to travel to a gumpha on the way to Singik. But Helmut changed his mind and left early to take some photographs. He reveals to Feluda that Shelvankar used to keep the statue with him in his pocket as he thought it as a lucky charm. But after the accident, the statue was not found. Helmut also tells that the reason of this superstition is because of the advice of a certain Dr. Vaidya. Later in the evening, Feluda and Topshe go to the Tibetan Institute to learn more of the statue. Feluda asks the driver of the taxi he is travelling in, to come in the morning the next day because he wants to see the scene of the accident. They reach the Tibetan Institute, where the curator declares that the Yamantak which Shelvankar had would cost a little more than 10000 rupees. Feluda returns to the hotel to find Bose waiting for him. Bose tells Feluda that tomorrow he will be leaving for Bombay. Next day, Nishikanto Sarkar tells Feluda that someone threw a paper in his room. The paper consisted of a Tibetan word, which simply meant - death. Later Feluda and Topshe travel to the accident site. There Feluda finds a white button. He also reveals that someone had tried to make the boulder fall by using a strong rod and that this accident was nothing but a well-planned murder. Feluda sends a telegram to Bose asking him to come back to Gangtok. The next day, Nishikanto Sarkar, Helmut Ungar, Topshe and Feluda travel to Rumtek for seeing the lama dance. Feluda learns, through a telegram, that Shelvankar's estranged son is present in a Sikkim monastery and a detective agency has found him. Then, Feluda hears someone shouting. He and Topshe come to the source of the sound and find that Mr. Sarkar had been pushed down the cliff. They rescue him and they come back to Gangtok. In the evening, they come to the dak bungalow, where Helmut is staying. There they meet a strange looking man. Helmut introduces him as Dr. Vaidya. Dr. Vaidya, who specializes in talking to souls of the departed, tells all of them (through Shelvankar's spirit) that he was murdered and Virendra is responsible for his death. Helmut tells that Virendra is Shelvankar's only son. Dr. Vaidya tells Feluda that tomorrow he will be traveling to Pemiangchi. Next morning, Topshe finds a paper near Feluda's ashtray. The paper consisted of the same Tibetan word, meaning death. Feluda tells Topshe that today he will conduct an experiment on the North Sikkim Highway. After conducting the experiment, Feluda concludes that the murder was done by first hitting Shelvankar with a rod and then throwing the vehicle down the cliff. Then, a boulder was thrown to make it look like an accident. The driver was bribed. While Feluda was telling this, a boulder comes crashing down. Topshe saves Feluda from being crushed. In the evening, Helmut comes to Feluda's room and shows him 2 photographs. The photographs were taken during the crime. It shows a man wearing red clothes standing on top of the mountain and seeing the car falling down. When Feluda tells that is that man Virendra, Helmut tells that it is impossible because he is only Virendra. He tells Feluda and Topshe that he did not like his father marrying twice and thus ran away from home. Then his father approached a detective agency to find his son. Then Helmut (or Virendra) came to Sikkim. Helmut tells Feluda that he suspects Dr. Vaidya being the murderer. They decide to travel to Pemiangchi to apprehend Dr. Vaidya. They pull in Mr. Sarkar also. Next day, while travelling to Pemiangchi, Sasadhar Bose also follows them and requests them to take him also. They reach Pemiangchi in the evening. There they find that Dr. Vaidya is not there but he left his stick in the dak bungalow. Feluda then announces that Sasadhar Bose is the killer. He killed Shelvankar to take over the ownership of the company. When Bose says that he had gone to his nephew's wedding during the murder, Feluda reminds him that in the Bengali calendar no wedding is held during the month of Chaitra since it is an inauspicious month and that they had came together to Sikkim during the starting of the month of Baishakh, the first month of the Bengali calendar. Feluda tells that that Sasadhar Bose and Dr. Vaidya are the same person. Dr. Vaidya told Shelvankar of his own life and impressed him. While going to the gumpha, Dr. Vaidya and Shelvankar travelled in the same car. Then Dr. Vaidya/Sasadhar Bose hit Shelvankar with a rod and murdered him. Then he came back to Kolkata. Then as Sasadhar Bose, he travelled in the same plane with Feluda. Dr. Vaidya tried to put the blame on Virendra, although he did not know that Helmut was actually Virendra. When he saw that Feluda was conducting an investigation, he tried to kill Feluda. Feluda also tells that Mr. Sarkar wanted to steal the statue of Yamantak from Shelvankar. So after the murder, he came down to find the statue, But Bose saw him and started harassing him. Bose tries to escape but is caught by leeches. Feluda finds the statue in the belongings of Sasadhar Bose. Sasadhar Bose is arrested and Feluda solves one of his most complex cases. Characters * Prodosh Chandra Mitter aka.

This is essentially a version of the ximage interface where the actual image data is stored in a SysV shared memory segment, and thus need not be transferred across the socket to the X server. For large images, use of this facility can result in some real performance increases. Additionally, some implementations provide shared memory pixmaps. These are two-dimensional arrays of pixels in a format specified by the X server, where the image data is stored in the shared memory segment. Through use of shared memory pixmaps, it is possible to change the contents of these pixmaps without using any Xlib routines at all. Shared memory pixmaps can only be supported when the X server can use regular virtual memory for pixmap data; if the pixmaps are stored in the on-board memory of graphics hardware, an application will not be able to share them with the server. In the 1.15 release of the X.org server the MIT-SHM extension gains two additional requests: 'X_ShmAttachFd' and 'X_ShmCreateSegment', to be able to pass shared memory through file descriptors from client to server and from server to client, reducing the number of copy operations further.

The OITC and Ecuador In late 2005 Germania Ullauri, the mayoress of the Ecuadorian municipality of O√±a, travelled to Cambodia to meet representatives of the OITC to discuss an investment proposal. According to the local media, OITC called itself variously the Oficina Internacional de Control del Tesoro or Oficina Internacional de Control de Tesorer√≠a. It represented itself as being headquartered in Singapore, Cambodia and Malaysia, and declared its intention to establish an office in the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil. The OITC appointed Ullauri as its \\"ambassador\\" to the 219 municipalities of Ecuador. Following her trip to Cambodia, she convened a meeting of municipal leaders from Ecuador's Azuay, Ca√±ar and Morona-Santiago Provinces to brief them on the OITC's proposals. The OITC proposed to invest US$150 million in a hydro- electric project in the region, subject to Ullauri placing $20,000 in a bank account in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as a deposit.

Another $2.5 billion was later offered, for a total of $6 billion. The OITC's \\"Chief of Cabinet\\", Keith Scott, met with the Fijian finance minister Ratu Jone Kubuabola and 215 middle level Fijian chiefs to promise that the money would be brought to Fiji and that \\"this cannot be stopped by any human being.\\"\\"FIJI: Prime Minister Expresses Doubts About Landowners Bank\\", Pacific Magazine, 4 March 2006 According to Ratu Osea Gavidi of the VLRA, the bank would help Fijians to access funds for development purposes which they could not get from commercial organizations, and so make it easier for Fijians to obtain loans.\\"Police to look into bank financers\\", Fiji Times, 3 March 2006 Ratu Osea claimed that the OITC had already invested $400 billion in China, though the Chinese Embassy in Fiji was unable to confirm this. A memorandum of understanding was signed on 3 March between Scott and the head of the VLRA, under which the OITC was to provide 50% of the bank's funding and the landowners the other 50%. They were expected to use their land and resources as collateral. Under the terms of the MOU, the OITC would fund equipment for landowners, the development of a \\"Community Aged Center\\", the development of a community-owned tourist and resort centre, the construction of modern prisons and support for a reforestation programme. The MOU was signed in chaotic circumstances which culminated in the attending journalists being thrown out by security guards acting for the OITC.

Vosanibola said that the government had no knowledge of either party and noted that neither Scott nor the OITC had submitted an application to do business in Fiji, as required by immigration regulations.

They (VLRA) must be careful when someone comes along and promises such a thing, they must check it out first.\\" Following the Fijian government's request for a police investigation, Fiji Commissioner of Police Andrew Hughes told the media that \\"nothing that [the police] received gave credence or legitimacy to the organisation and Mr Scott ... What we can say is that the information that we do have at hand leads us to conclude that the proposed transaction is highly irregular, it is questionable and leaves me with a profound level of suspicion.\\" He urged the Fijian parties to the OITC deal not to \\"send any money if it's requested as some form of an advanced fee for this transaction to proceed\\" (the sending of advance fees is a widely used method of fraud).

The FTIB found that the OITC \\"neither has any fixed address or office nor are there any reliable contact addresses which are pivotal for approval of applications.\\" The decision produced an angry response from the head of the VLRA, who vowed that \\"Our relationship with the OITC will continue no matter what.\\" \\"No permit for $6bn bank\\", Fiji Times, 17 April 2006 OITC story unravels In 2010, the secretive OITC surfaced in Cambodia‚Äôs capital Phnom Penh.

Once the book-packaging company has produced the book, they then sell it to the final publishing company. In this arrangement, the book-packaging company acts as a liaison between a publishing company and the writers, researchers, editors, and printers that design and produce the book. Book packagers thus blend the roles of agent, editor, and publisher. Book-packaging is common in the genre fiction market, particularly for books aimed at preteens and teenagers, and in the illustrated non-fiction co-edition market. Business model Publishing companies use the services of book-packaging companies in cases where the publishing company does not have the in-house resources to handle a project. There are two main reasons that publishing houses hire a book-packaging company: labor-intensive books (books with many illustrations or photographs, books which require coordinating the input of several authors, or 'novelty' books, such as gardening books that contain seed packages) and series books (e.g., Nancy Drew, Sweet Valley High, Goosebumps, and the For Dummies series). In many cases, the book is first conceived as a marketing concept, and a writer is then hired to write the book on a work for hire basis. In some cases, book packaging companies use a celebrity with a very marketable name as the credited author, while using a professional ghostwriter to do most of the writing, researching, and editing. Book-packaging is a common strategy between smaller publishers in different territorial markets where the company that first buys the intellectual property rights, sells a package to other publishers and gains an immediate return on capital invested. The first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all territories and thereby obtain the maximum quantity discounts on the print run for all. Remuneration and credit While the book-packaging sector is little-known outside the publishing world, it provides employment to many freelance authors and illustrators, particularly for those willing to work as ghostwriters, without credit in the book. Most book packaging companies pay a flat rate for manuscripts ranging from several thousand dollars to $1 per word. However, most book packaging companies do not pay royalties, which means that even if a ghostwriter's novel becomes a bestseller, the writer will not receive additional payment. Often, writers or creators working for book-packagers work anonymously as ghostwriters, under the book-packaging company name (\\"by our staff writers\\"), or under a pen name. In some cases, a writer's work will be credited to someone else's name, such as a celebrity, who is paid to be listed as the credited author as a way of increasing sales.

As with other (standing) committees, the activities of a committee of the whole are limited to considering and making recommendations on matters that the assembly has referred to it; it cannot take up other matters or vote directly on the assembly's business. The purpose of a committee of the whole is to relax the usual limits on debate, allowing a more open exchange of views without the urgency of a final vote. Debates in a committee of the whole may be recorded but are often excluded from the assembly's minutes. After debating, the committee submits its conclusions to the assembly (that is, to itself) and business continues according to the normal rules. In legislative assemblies, the committee stage of important bills is typically conducted by the committee of the whole, whereas lesser bills may be considered in smaller committees. Australia In the Australian House of Representatives, the \\"Federation Chamber\\" meets separately from the House and has its own committee room, and deals with uncontroversial matters. The Federation Chamber was created in 1994, to relieve some of the burden on the entire House: different matters can be processed in the House at large and in the Federation Chamber, as they sit simultaneously. It is designed to be less formal, with a quorum of only three members: the Deputy Speaker of the House, one government member, and one non- government member. Decisions must be unanimous: any divided decision sends the question back to the House at large. The Federation Chamber was introduced in 1994, and replaced the previous Main Committee. In the Australian Senate, the Committee of the Whole is provided for by Chapter 21 of the standing orders.ANNOTATED STANDING ORDERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN SENATE Chapter 21 - Committees of the Whole, Parliament of Australia. It is presided over by the Chairman of Committees.ANNOTATED STANDING ORDERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN SENATE Chapter 3 - Deputy President and Chairman of Committees: 11 Duty of Chairman, Parliament of Australia. Canada In the House of Commons of Canada, a Committee of the Whole is chaired by the deputy speaker or the deputy chair of committees. In the past, the Committee of the Whole considered a majority of bills, with few bills being sent to parliamentary committees. The increased workload of MPs has led to a decline in this use of the Committee of the Whole. Now the Committee of the Whole is used mostly for monetary bills and on rare occasions to expedite the passage of other legislation.Jackson and Jackson, Politics in Canada, p. 320 On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper formally apologized in the House of Commons for the government's historical role in the Canadian residential school system. A Committee of the Whole was used, so that aboriginal leaders (who were not Members of Parliament) could be allowed to respond to the apology on the floor of the House.Toronto Star, Jun 13, 2008 \\"NDP aide's Commons sense saved the day\\" Hong Kong In the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, when the debate of the second reading resumes, members debate the general merits and principles of the bill. At the committee stage, the Legislative Council becomes a \\"Committee of the whole Council\\" and goes through the bill clause by clause, making amendments where necessary. After the bill has passed through Committee with or without amendments, it proceeds to the third reading for passage by the Council. United Kingdom In the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the Committee of the Whole House is used instead of a standing committee for the clause-by-clause debate of important or contentious bills. The Chairman of Ways and Means presides in this instance. The Committee originated as means to consider legislation without the presence of royal officers and without a formal record being made of the proceedings. The Speaker was not only relieved of his chair but also excluded from the chamber since he was then regarded as partial to the Crown.Campion, Gilbert (1958) An Introduction to the Procedure of the House of Commons 3rd ed. In the House of Lords, the Committee of the Whole House examines the majority of bills. United States =United States Congress= The United States House of Representatives has one Committee of the Whole, called the \\"Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,\\" with original consideration of all bills that include tax increase or outlay provisions. This committee also receives the President's State of the Union message and historically was responsible for dividing it among other committees, but that is no longer the case. The Speaker of the House designates a member to preside over the Committee, who is normally a member of the majority party who does not hold the chair of a standing committee. Other committees of the whole have existed historically but have been discontinued. The United States Senate considered matters in Quasi-Committee of the Whole (described below) for 197 years from the 1st Congress in 1789 and ceased using it in 1986 during the 99th Congress. Non-legislative use and variants Under Robert's Rules of Order an assembly may move to commit to the committee of the whole, or simply to go into a committee of the whole at the suggestion of the presider and without objection. Upon a successful motion to go into a committee of the whole, the presiding officer designates a member to preside over the committee and yields the chair. The committee may proceed on the referred subject by debating it, considering amendments, or adopting recommendations. To conclude its proceedings, the committee votes to \\"rise and report.\\" The presiding officer of the assembly then resumes the chair and accepts a report from the presiding officer of the committee. The more relaxed committee debating rules are enforced, for examples, Members may speak on a question more than once in a committee of the whole, but members who have not already spoken have priority. While sitting as a Committee of the Whole, an assembly can consider only that matter (or matters) referred to it: Unrelated motions are out of order. Smaller assemblies can avoid the formalities of committing and reporting by considering a matter as if in a committee of the whole, or by considering it informally. Either option opens debate in the manner of the committee of the whole, but the presiding officer retains the chair. In the former case, also called a quasi-committee of the whole, all amendment adoptions are tentative and open debate ends when the assembly adopts a motion other than an amendment. The chair then announces the amendments that were adopted in quasi-committee, which are subject to a confirming vote. In the latter option, votes are binding on the assembly and any successful motion to dispose of the current main motion ends the informal debate. Going into a committee of the whole or quasi committee of the whole are alternatives to taking a straw poll (which is not allowed according to Robert's Rules). The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure rejects both the committee of the whole and quasi committee of the whole procedures as being outdated, and instead recommends the motion to consider informally in their place.

The dam was built for water conservation, irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, flood control, and recreational purposes and as an international border crossing between Zapata and Starr Counties and Tamaulipas. Construction on the dam began in December 1950 and ended in April 1954 but it was dedicated by presidents Adolfo Ruiz Cortines and Dwight D. Eisenhower in October 1953.International Boundary and Water Commission; Falcon Dam Construction The Falcon Dam was authorized by the Treaty for the Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande or Water Treaty of 1944 between Mexico and the United States. Construction on the dam began on 15 December 1950 and the reservoir began to fill on 25 August 1953. The dam was dedicated on 19 October 1953 and work was officially complete on 8 April 1954. By October 1954, the dam's hydroelectric power station began to produce electricity. Characteristics The U.S. Power Station The Falcon Dam is a high and long earthen embankment dam. The dam is made of of earth-fill, of concrete and of reinforced steel. The center of the dam is over-topped with a long spillway with widths ranging from at the top and at the bottom. The spillway is controlled by six fixed wheel gates and can release up to downstream. The Falcon Dam supplies water to two different hydroelectric power plants, one on the Mexican side and another on the U.S. side. Each power plant contains 3 x 10.5 MW Francis turbine generators for a combined total of 63 MW. Each power plant also receives water from the reservoir via 4 x diameter penstocks. The two extra penstocks are for an additional generator if needed. The Falcon Dam created the Falcon International Reservoir that has a volume of and a surface area of . Border crossing The Falcon Dam Port of Entry is a port of entry at the Falcon Dam to the United States on the Mexican border. It is essentially a replacement for the former Zapata Port of Entry, which was situated at a bridge in the town of Zapata, Texas. When the dam was completed, the town was moved to higher ground, and the Zapata Bridge now lies at the bottom of Falcon Lake. 2010 Plot In June 2010, U.S. authorities revealed that the Los Zetas drug cartel had planned to destroy the Falcon Dam to terrorize the rival Gulf Cartel, which smuggles drugs in the area. Small amounts of dynamite discovered near the dam and a copy of a warning helped alert authorities. A larger U.S. and Mexican security presence in the area may have thwarted the attack that Los Zetas had reportedly warned civilians about on the Mexican side of the border.

The band is perhaps best known for performing as the opening act of The Beatles' February 12, 1964 concert at Carnegie Hall. In 1963 the group released the album Well, Well, Well on United Artists Records, produced by LeRoy Holmes. The group also released a cover of the traditional folk song, \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" in December 1963. The \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" single was intended as a lament for the recently assassinated John F. Kennedy and peaked as #126 on the Billboard singles chart. In July 1963, prior to becoming a recording act, the group began playing regularly at the Crossway Inn in Miami. The General Manager of the Crossway Inn, Ray Barbarino, had networking connections and expertise as an entertainment manager and promoter. Utilizing these connections, Barbarino brought his friend and colleague, LeRoy Holmes of United Artists Records, down from New York to listen to the band, successfully securing a recording contract for them with the label. During the mid-1960s, the Crossway Inn hosted appearances by many top celebrities and bands, including Peter, Paul and Mary, The Mamas & the Papas, Fats Domino, and Guy Lombardo & his Orchestra. Over the years, several local Miami talents have become national celebrities following appearances at the Crossway Inn, including The Miami Sound Machine (featuring singer Gloria Estefan) and the popular Latin singer, Willie Chirino. After signing with United Artists, the Briarwood Singers' recorded their one and only album, Well, Well, Well which was issued in late 1963. In early 1964, Barbarino arranged for the band to be the opening act for The Beatles while working with Jackie Gleason and the Miami Beach Convention Center management team. In the early 1970s, Gabe Kaplan, who at that time was an unknown stand-up comedian, repeatedly pestered Barbarino for a job at the Crossway. As he had done with the Briarwood Singers, Barbarino set Kaplan up with his contacts in New York and within a year Kaplan had become a celebrity. It's possible that the character of Vinnie Barbarino from the U.S. sitcom, Welcome Back, Kotter, played by John Travolta, is a tribute of sorts to Ray Barbarino from Kaplan, who was the show's star. Barry Monroe currently plays music professionally in Southern Colorado as Barry Monroe and Friends and with his group, Cheap Therapy. Stan Beach is a retired airline captain and lives in the mountains of western North Carolina in the town of Spruce Pine with his wife Marie. Stan continues to pursue his love of music as a solo singing act and as lead male vocalist and lead guitar player for the local group, Chalk Mountain Connection. The Briarwood Singer's only female member, Dorinda Duncan, went on to sign a solo recording contract with United Artists Records in early 1965, following the breakup of The Briarwood Singers. During 1965 she released the John D. Loudermilk-penned single, \\"They'll Love You\\", as well as an album of Bob Dylan covers titled The Songs of Bob Dylan Through the Heart of a Girl. Bob Hoffman became a journalist and author. He currently lives in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, with his wife Lesley.

It is commonly referred to as multipurpose or Raufoss, meaning red waterfall in Norwegian. This refers to Nammo's precursor company Raufoss Ammunisjonsfabrikker, an ammunition manufacturer established 1896 in Raufoss, Norway. The \\"Mk 211\\" name comes from the nomenclature Mk 211 Mod 0 used by the U.S. military for this round. The Raufoss Mk.211 projectile Design details The multipurpose concept developed by Raufoss is unique in that, instead of using a mechanical fuse, it uses a pyrotechnical detonation train to ensure proper detonation of the explosive and incendiary components. The multipurpose name is based on the projectile having an armor-piercing (tungsten core), an explosive, and an incendiary component, thus making it capable of penetrating lightly armored targets and causing damage to personnel inside the target after penetration. It is a suitable round for engaging helicopters, aircraft and lightly armored vehicles, as well as unarmored vehicles, and it is capable of igniting jet fuel. The Mk 211 has about the same destructive power as a standard 20mm round against such targets and can penetrate 11 mm of RHA at 45¬∞ from a range of 1000 meters. The Mk 211 is a very popular .50 caliber sniper round used in the Barrett M82 rifle and other .50 BMG rifles. It is also often used in heavy machine guns such as the M2 Browning. Due to its popularity, several U.S. arms manufacturers produce the round under license from NAMMO Raufoss AS. There is also a tracer variant, the Mk 300 (NM160 in Norwegian service), used in the Browning heavy machine gun. However, due to the complex structure of the projectile and consequently high costs (ca US$65 per round), the popularity is restricted to special mission profiles. Identification WCC in the US with a projectile probably produced by the NAMMO-Raufoss Company of Norway. Loaded magazine for an M-107 sniper/anti-materiel rifle This round is usually identified by a green over white paint tip mark. Its tracer variant, which is typically only used with belt-fed machine guns in naval applications, includes a row of red paint between the green and white rows. The headstamp on the casing will not help to identify the round as Raufoss. Common headstamps are used, and only designate the location, and year of final assembly of the completed round. Headstamps in general will read as (but are not limited to): HXP 89, WCC 94, LC 01 or FN 91. The two or three letter prefix (HXP, WCC, LC or FN) designates the place of assembly; the two-digit suffix numbers specify the production year. Legality There has been much debate over whether the Mk 211 projectile is legal to use against personnel, or if it is strictly anti-materiel ammunition. The International Committee of the Red Cross has sought to have the ammunition banned, due to concern over the incendiary and explosive components and their effect on personnel. Under the Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868 the \\"military or naval\\" use of explosive or incendiary projectiles with a mass of under 400 grams is forbidden. However, that declaration does not govern the conduct of non-signatory parties. Further, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 ‚Äì which superseded the St. Petersburg Declaration, and were signed by a far wider circle of nations ‚Äì do permit the use of such ammunition for auto-cannons and heavy machine guns. Machine guns firing .50 cal/12.7mm ammunition are heavy machine guns. At best, the ICRC's position can be applied to only the group of nations that were parties to the St. Petersburg Declaration. Trials conducted by Forsvarets Forskningsinstitutt (Norwegian Defence Research Establishment) have concluded that the ammunition most likely does not have an unlawful effect if unintentionally used against personnel, as the round will have penetrated the body and exited on the other side before the explosive and incendiary components of the round are initiated. Upon hitting a person the round will detonate about 50% of the time; if the target is wearing body armor a higher detonation frequency is to be expected (as shown by the ICRC tests carried out in 1999). If detonated, the round will have a significant fragmentation and incendiary effect in a 30-degree cone behind the struck target, and this might affect others standing in the vicinity. The distance the round will travel from ignition to detonation is 30‚Äì40 cm, so if the target is hit at very specific angles the round may still be inside the target at the time of detonation. The official stance of the Norwegian government is that the 12.7 mm MP round should not be used against personnel, but an exception has been made for snipers using the round due to the practical limitations of snipers having to change the type of ammunition used when switching between hardened and soft targets. It is being exported strictly in an anti-mat√©riel capacity.

His life and fortune swung like a weather vane, due to complex plots and the troubled time following Peter the Great's death. Life Son of a boyar, Vasili Dolgorukov was, starting from 1685, a stolnik at the royal court. He was then enlisted in the Preobrazhensky regiment in 1700, starting his true military career. Serving in the Preobrazhensky regiment, he took part in Russian Northern Wars and distinguished himself during the siege of Mitava in 1705. In 1706, he was transferred to Ukraine, where he was under the command of Ivan Mazepa, where he distinguished himself in 1707‚Äì1708 during the squelching of the Bulavin Rebellion. During the Battle of Poltava he was the commander of the reserve cavalry force. In 1715, he was sent to Poland as a represent of Peter (who was ill at that time), where he concluded, in 1716, a pact with Danzig, forcing the city into an anti-Swedish policy. He also accompanied Peter the Great during his foreign travels in 1717 and 1718. Despite being a favorite of Peter the Great, Dolgorukov disapproved a number of Peter's reforms, and eventually became a partisan of tsarevich Alexei Petrovich. In 1718, following Alexei's trial and death, Dolgorukov reproached Peter such a violent behavior towards his own son. Dolgorukov was tried, demoted and exiled to Solikamsk. Following Catherine I's coronation on 7 May 1724. Dolgorukov was brought back from his exile and given the rank of colonel and then brigadier. In 1726, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Caucasus forces. In 1728, as an ultimate consecration of his military career, he was promoted field marshal and member of the Supreme Privy Council. After Anna Ioanovna's coronation in 1730, Dolgoroukov was appointed to Senate and made president of College of War. However, reportedly made insulting remarks regarding persecutions staged by Anna against his family. In 1731, after a complex plot, he was accused of insulting remarks regarding the Empress and sentenced to death. His sentence was changed to life imprisonment first in Schlisselburg fortress, then in Ivangorod in 1737, and finally he was exiled for life to the Solovetsky Monastery in 1739. In December 1741, following Elizabeth's coronation, Dorgorukov was brought back from his exile and fully rehabilitated. Elizabeth named him president of the College of War, a rank that he assumed until his death. While serving in the War College, Dolgoroukov made significant improvements regarding the organization and logistics of Russian military.

The Sugar Bowl is an unusual pure giant sequoia grove on top of Redwood Mountain.Google Books: Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park: Must-Do Hikes for Everyone; by Mike White; Trail 16 (chapter) - Redwood Mountain Grove. Plant life and fire studies The grove contains many types of plant life, with the most significant being the giant sequoias. Within the grove one finds many different tree species. The trees that are most prominent in the grove include species such as the white fir, sugar pine, incense cedar, ponderosa pine, red fir, and Jeffrey pine. Each type of these tree species is most numerous within different sections of the grove. The trees have a significant importance to the grove, and natural disasters such as fires have many effects on it. In 1969, parts of the grove were burned to prevent the possibility of other fires from happening, and they aided in restoring the ecosystem and natural life in the area. Fires such as these were also used for scientific research. The fires can have major effects on forests and other wilderness areas. The fires can act as part of the natural cycle for restoring natural life in the environment and ecosystems in the grove and other parks. The Redwood Mountain Grove was involved in several studies that looked at different species of trees present in the grove and the environment surrounding the area. Some of these studies included the investigation of how fires affected the trees and environment in the grove. The Redwood Mountain Grove was used for the study and analysis of several burns. The burning of small areas in the grove occurred to observe and understand the effects of different fires on the ecosystem. It also presented the benefits to the grove through the examination of the results of the areas burned. They highlighted the effects fires have on the many trees, other natural life, and wilderness of the Redwood Mountain Grove and its surroundings. Noteworthy trees Hart Tree trunk, with basal burn.

The Mayor of High Wycombe, a town in Buckinghamshire, England, is chosen each year at the Annual Meeting of the Charter Trustees. The Charter Trustees of the town of High Wycombe are councillors appointed to the Town Wards who have a ceremonial role as Charter Trustees in addition to their District Council responsibilities.Mayor's Office homepage Annually, one of the Charter Trustees is nominated by his/her peers to be Mayor of the town. The office of Mayor is apolitical and the person represents the town at many civic and ceremonial events, both in the town and at other functions outside the town/district. Robbie Coltrane TV Documentary The ‚Äòweighting in ceremony‚Äô was shown on the first episode of Robbie Coltrane‚Äôs TV documentary series ‚ÄòB-Road Britain‚Äô which was aired in August 2007 on ITV1. It showed the outgoing and former mayor Darren Hayday along with the incoming mayor Valerie Razzaq. Tolling out and Weighing-in Connected with the election of a new Mayor in High Wycombe are the customs of 'tolling out' and 'weighing-in'. The former, which ceased with the Municipal Corporation Act, arose from the behaviour of Mr. Henry Shepard in 1678 who was reported as being drunk and misbehaving himself. It was decreed that the great Bell should be rung out in testimony of his misdemeanours. So according to this ancient custom the old Mayor was tolled out by tolling the great bell on the morning of the new Mayor's election. The party then proceeded in state to Church, and afterwards a drummer who continued to drum the old Mayor out preceded the procession, although this tradition was lost at some point and only reintroduced in 1999. This was followed by the weighing-in ceremony, which took place in the bar Iron Warehouse in White Hart Street. The weighing process is recorded and the result compared to the weight at the end of the mayoral year. For each of the mayor and corporation, if there has been a weight gain in that year, the person is considered to have been gaining that weight at the taxpayers' expense; they would be jeered and booed, historically accompanied with thrown tomatoes and rotten fruit.

History One of the first activities undertaken by Fokker after World War II was the design of a new military aircraft for initial pilot training, the S-11 Instructor. An aircraft trader already placed orders for 100 of these aircraft in 1946, before construction had even begun. The first prototype flew at Schiphol on 18 December 1947. During testing in early 1948 it was found that some aerodynamic changes had to be made to improve the handling of the aircraft. Later that year demonstration flights for several air forces followed and eventually many S-11s were sold to the Royal Netherlands Air Force, Israeli Air Force, Italian Air Force, Brazilian Air Force, Paraguayan Air Force and Bolivian Air Force. Some 170 aircraft were license built in Italy as the Macchi M.416. A limited number of S-11 Instructors are still flying today. The Dutch organization Fokker Four dedicated to the preservation of the aircraft operates four S-11s and amongst other activities still performs with them on airshows.

Over time, as technology became more complex and rules on Accountants' independence and objectivity became stricter, nearly all CPAs gravitated away from reselling the software. Now Sage 100 ERP (see below) is primarily re-sold by a network of independent software consultants. In 1998 State of The Art was acquired by U.K. based Sage Group PLC. In October 2011 Sage released version 4.50 of the MAS 90 (and MAS 200) product line, which included an option to use a Microsoft SQL Server database and also an included single user license for Sage CRM. With the release of version 4.50 Sage discontinued their bundled version labeled Sage Extended Enterprise which combined Sage ERP MAS 200, Sage CRM and Sage FAS Fixed Assets and instead merged those features into the core Sage ERP MAS 90 and 200 4.50. During the Sage Summit 2011 partner and customer conference, Sage North America announced that many of their products, including Sage ERP MAS 90 and 200, would undergo a rebranding in 2012. Beginning with the next release of Sage ERP MAS 90 and 200 the product would be rebranded as Sage 100 ERP. More specifically Sage ERP MAS 90 would launch as Sage 100 Standard ERP and Sage ERP MAS 200 would launch as Sage 100 Advanced ERP . The edition with a SQL Server database would launch as Sage 100 Premium ERP. Sage 100 Standard operates in a file server environment. Sage 100 Advanced is functionally equivalent, but operates in a client‚Äìserver environment running under Windows 20xx operating systems. Sage 100 primarily targets the wholesale distribution industry, and most of the continued development and enhancement to the software line is centered on the wholesale distribution and warehouse management niche. However, it has many enhancements making it suitable for other industries as well; at present, there are over 20 separate software modules, including some for light manufacturing and e-commerce. Sage 100 uses SAP Business Objects' Crystal Reports for almost all of its built-in and custom reports. Some of the remaining 'legacy' modules, such as Work Order Processing or Job Cost still have 'hard coded' non-user editable reports, but users can still create new reports using the included Crystal Reports tool. In November 2015 Sage introduced Sage 100c which was primarily a subscription version of Sage 100 with a modernized interface. Gradually additional Sage 100c specific integrations were added as a benefit of subscription. In 2018, Sage announced that Sage 100c will be renamed as Sage 100cloud to both highlight the benefits of its connected cloud capabilities and stress its integration capabilities with Sage Business Cloud.

M.: Verlag Das Segel, 1960; (zitiert aus/nach: Prediger in der H√∂lle, Gedenkheft zur 25. Wiederkehr des Todestages von Paul Schneider, Verlag Kirche und Mann, G√ºtersloh) Early life Paul Schneider as a student Schneider was born in Pferdsfeld, Germany in 1897, the second of three sons born to Gustav-Adolf Schneider and Elisabeth Schnorr. He had a strong love for his mother and a great respect for his father, who was a pastor and an ardent patriot. Following military service in World War I, Schneider began his theological studies and was ordained in Hochelheim in 1925. The following year, he married Margarete Dieterich, the daughter of a pastor. In 1927, the couple had their first son, followed by a daughter and four more sons. Nazi opposition When President Paul von Hindenburg named Adolf Hitler Chancellor in 1933, Schneider was the pastor of the Hochelheim congregation, having succeeded his father who died in 1926. Initially, Pastor Schneider believed that the new Chancellor, with the help of divine guidance, would lead Germany into a bright future. It did not take long for him to perceive the true character of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime. Schneider did not stand by idly as Nazi leaders ridiculed the morality of the Church. In writing and in preaching, he protested against the vitriol directed against the Church by Nazi officials. Pastor Schneider received no backing from his consistory of the old-Prussian Ecclesiastical Province of the Rhineland, then seated in Koblenz. On the contrary, in order to placate Nazi officials who complained about Pastor Schneider, the consistory transferred him to a remote region of Germany. Early in 1934, Schneider and his family moved to Dickenschied, where he became pastor to the Dickenschied and Womrath congregations. That same year, Pastor Schneider became a member of the Confessing Church, a Protestant organization that opposed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime. On one occasion at the funeral of a Hitler youth boy a Nazi official said in his speech that the deceased would now be member of the heavenly storm of Horst Wessel. Pastor Schneider responded that he would not know if a heavenly storm of Horst Wessel existed but the Lord would bless the boy and take him into his realm. After this, the Nazi leader came forward and repeated his words. Pastor Schneider then responded sharply that he would not allow God's word to be adulterated during a Christian ceremony. As a result he was arrested for one week in June 1934. In March 1935, Nazi officials took Pastor Schneider into ‚Äúprotective custody‚Äù (Schutzhaft), a Nazi euphemism for ‚Äúarrest‚Äù without any judicial warrant. They held him for a few days because he insisted on reading from the pulpit the synodal criticism of the government‚Äôs policy toward the Church. Local Nazi officials summoned Schneider for interrogations twelve times during the winter of 1935/1936. He continued to speak his mind and follow the dictates of his conscience. Some of his friends pleaded with him to avoid confrontation with the Nazis. He responded that he did not seek martyrdom, but that he had to follow his Lord. His primary responsibility was to prepare his family for eternal life ‚Äì not to ensure their material well-being. Arrest and imprisonment In spring 1937, with the support of members of his presbytery, Pastor Schneider began the process of excommunicating parishioners who, because of their allegiance to the Nazi Party, engaged in conduct which violated congregational discipline. Complaints to Nazi officials by the censured led to the arrest of Pastor Schneider. Following two months in the Koblenz prison, officials released him with the warning not to return to the Rhineland, where his home and parish were located. Pastor Schneider knew that, if he returned to his flock, it would mean imprisonment in a concentration camp. Yet, the night before his release, he read in his Bible the story concerning the crisis confronted by Deborah. When Deborah summoned the twelve tribes together to confront the common enemy, only Naphtali and Zebulun responded. Pastor Schneider saw in this Old Testament story [Judges 5:18] a parallel to the crisis which the Church confronted in Nazi Germany, and he concluded that even if his was a minority voice, he must act in harmony with his conscience, and protest. Following his release from prison, Pastor Schneider spent two months with his wife and a few family members and friends in Baden-Baden and in Eschbach. He and Margarete returned home for Harvest Thanksgiving () on October 3, 1937. Pastor Schneider was able to celebrate this occasion with his Dickenschied congregation, but local police arrested him as he journeyed to Womrath for an evening worship service. Paul Schneider's cell in Buchenwald Buchenwald Schneider was incarcerated in Buchenwald, near Weimar, on November 27, 1937, just a few months after the camp opened. In the labor commandos, Pastor Schneider watched out for his fellow inmates. After being sentenced to solitary confinement, he preached the good news of the Gospel from the window of his prison cell. He was moved to the cell when he refused to remove his beret in honour of Hitler on the F√ºhrer's birthday, April 20, 1938 and to salute the swastika flag. He explained his behaviour by saying \\"I cannot salute this criminal symbol\\". He also refused, as he had done earlier, the Hitler salute, saying that \\"you can only receive salvation (Heil) from the Lord and not from a human being\\". From his cell, Schneider accused his captors and encouraged his fellow inmates. On one occasion on Easter Sunday, when thousands of prisoners were assembled for mustering, despite being severely handicapped by previous torture he climbed to the cell window and shouted: \\"Comrades, listen to me. This is Pastor Schneider. People are tortured and murdered here. So the Lord says, 'I am the resurrection and the life!'\\"Kameraden, h√∂rt mich. Hier spricht Pfarrer Paul Schneider. Hier wird gefoltert und gemordet. So spricht der Herr: Ich bin die Auferstehung und das Leben! His speech was interrupted by his tormentors. As others had pleaded years earlier, the man who mopped the floors in the solitary confinement building begged Schneider, \\"Please stop provoking the SS against you... They will beat you to death if you continue preaching from your cell window\\". After June 1938 the only reason for Schneider's imprisonment in Buchenwald was his refusal to accept the order to permanently leave his congregations in Dickenschied and Womrath. He could have been released from the KZ at any time, if he had agreed to accept this order. However, even under severe torture, he refused to do so.https://de.evangelischer- widerstand.de/html/view.php?type=dokument&id;=408&l;=de Death On July 18, 1939, Schneider was murdered with a lethal injection of strophanthin in the camp infirmary.https://www.gdw- berlin.de/vertiefung/biografien/personenverzeichnis/biografie/view-bio/paul- schneider/?no_cache=1 Camp officials notified Margarete Schneider of her husband‚Äôs death and she made the long journey from Dickenschied to retrieve his body in a sealed coffin. Despite Gestapo surveillance, hundreds of people and around two hundred fellow pastors attended Schneider‚Äôs funeral, including many members of the Confessing Church.https://en.evangelischer- widerstand.de/html/view.php?type=dokument&id;=405&l;=en One of the pastors preached at the grave side, ‚ÄúMay God grant that the witness of your shepherd, our brother, remain with you and continue to impact on future generations and that it remain vital and bear fruit in the entire Christian Church‚Äù.

He is the founder of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, a rabbinical seminary he refers to as \\"Open Orthodox\\", a term he coined to describe an offshoot of Orthodoxy, founder of Yeshivat Maharat for Open Orthodox women, co-founder of the International Rabbinical Fellowship, an Open Orthodox rabbinical association founded as a liberal alternative to the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America, and founder of the grassroots organization Coalition for Jewish Concerns ‚Äì Amcha. He received his rabbinical ordination at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (Yeshiva University) in 1968. During the 1970s and 1980s Weiss was best known for his involvement in \\"1 2 3 4; Open up the Iron Door\\" (Soviet Jewry). Increasingly since 2000, his name is associated with a movement to open to women as rabbinical candidates for the \\"stream\\" of Judaism from which his own ordination came: Orthodox Judaism. In the matter of conversion to Judaism, Weiss encountered difficulties with acceptability by the Israeli Rabbinate. Ordination of women by Weiss' movement is a source of friction. 2000s In 2013, Newsweek ranked him the 10th most prominent rabbi in the United States, climbing from number 11 in 2012 and number 12 in 2011, after being ranked number 18 in 2010. On June 29, 2015, Weiss resigned from the Rabbinical Council of America. He resigned before he likely would have been removed as he was denounced as an apikores by many of the leading members of the rabbinate. The Traditional Orthodox communities view his movement as neo-conservative and far removed from orthodoxy. On November 3, 2015, the Moetzes of Agudath Israel of America declared Open Orthodoxy, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Yeshivat Maharat and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism. Hebrew Institute of Riverdale The Hebrew Institute of Riverdale was founded in 1971 in a boiler room of the Whitehall Building off the Henry Hudson Parkway by former members of the Hebrew Institute of University Heights in the Bronx who had moved to Riverdale. Weiss, who had finished his training at Yeshiva University a few years earlier, became the synagogue's rabbi in 1973. The congregation has grown to 850 families, and has served as a platform for Weiss's rabbinical advocacy. In October 2014, Weiss announced that he would step down from his pulpit effective mid-2015. In July 2015 Rabbi Steven Exler became HIR's senior rabbi and Rabbi Weiss continues on its staff.Rabbi Avi Weiss to step down as rabbi of Hebrew Institute of Riverdale The synagogue introduced one Friday night \\"the first woman to lead this service in an established Orthodox synagogue in front of a mixed congregation.\\" Open Orthodoxy Weiss coined the term \\"Open Orthodoxy\\" in 1997. He contrasts it with Conservative Judaism, noting that the latter \\"is generally not composed of ritually observant Jews.\\" Rabbis associated with Orthodox Union (OU) and Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) have opposed this approach. Although there are other critics,Agudath Israel of America denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring Open Orthodoxy, Yeshivat Maharat, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism. Weiss is not without defenders. =Yeshivat Chovevei Torah= In 1999 Weiss founded Yeshivat Chovevei Torah (YCT), a rabbinic seminary in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx after resigning from Yeshiva University, where he had taught at Stern College for Women for decades. The school's graduates work as rabbis in synagogues, college Hillels and schools, but the Rabbinical Council of America does not permit membership to the school's graduates unless they have also been ordained by a traditional Orthodox rabbinical school. In June 2013, Weiss handed over the presidency of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah to Chicago rabbi Asher Lopatin. International Rabbinic Fellowship With Marc D. Angel, Weiss co-founded International Rabbinic Fellowship (IRF); it accepts YCT graduates.The RCA doesn't. =Ordination of Women= In May 2009, Weiss announced the opening of Yeshivat Maharat, a new school to train women, using a title he created. Sara Hurwitz was appointed dean of Yeshivat Maharat.  Activism  Weiss has been vocal on many issues, including emigration and absorption of Soviet Jews, clemency for Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, opposing terrorism, supporting Israel, preserving Holocaust memorials, and exposing anti-semitism. In 1992 he founded Amcha ‚Äì the Coalition for Jewish Concerns, a grassroots coalition engaging in pro-Jewish activism. =Soviet Jewry= Weiss was an early leader of the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry, founded in 1964. It was one of the first American organizations working to free Russian Jews, who were not allowed to emigrate during the Soviet era. The group used demonstrations, lobbying, and education to pressure the Soviet authorities into allowing Jews to leave the country. In 2015, he published his memoir detailing his efforts to liberate Soviet Jews, Open Up the Iron Door: Memoirs of a Soviet Jewry Activist. The book focuses on how grassroots activism and acts of civil disobedience led to important policy changes for the Soviet Jews. =Holocaust remembrance= A response to his \\"Holocaust Symbols or Objects of Worship\\" article in the March/April 2002 issue of Martyrdom and Resistance was printed in the September/October issue. The 2-section article acknowledged that \\"the most trustworthy guardian of the memory .. is to be found in Judaism itself, in its liturgy and its religious calendar.\\" The closing challenged Weiss to accept her idea of wearing a \\"yellow six-sided star ... for a few moments every year.\\" = In the United States = Weiss was an official emissary of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo and former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Weiss has served as personal rabbi to Jonathan Pollard, an American who spied for Israel sentenced to life in prison in 1987. In 1992 Weiss was one of the signators to a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the release of Pollard. In 1989 Weiss conducted a \\"freedom Seder\\" in front of the prison where Pollard was incarcerated. At a speech at New York City Hall in 2001 Weiss criticized President George W. Bush for not making a clearer distinction between Arab acts of terrorism and Israeli acts of self- defense. \\"The trap that he's falling into is that he's drawn a moral equivalency between cold-blooded murder and acts of self-defense,\\" Weiss said. In April 2002 Weiss organized a pro-Israel rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. and a boycott of several large newspapers perceived as having an anti-Israeli bias. In 2006 Weiss organized a protest in front of Syria's UN mission to denounce a Hezbollah offensive in the Middle East. In September 2011, Weiss was arrested in front of the U.N. building in New York while protesting the Palestinian statehood bid. In a July 15, 2015, Haaretz opinion piece, Weiss applauded the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, which he saw as a part of maintaining the separation of church and state and protecting his right to refuse to perform gay weddings. He stated that he would not participate in same-sex weddings, because doing so would run contrary to his religious commitments, but that he had met countless gay individuals and couples, some of whom were members of his synagogue, who lived loving, exemplary lives. \\"If I welcome with open arms those who do not observe Sabbath, Kashrut or family purity laws, I must welcome, even more so, homosexual Jews, as they are born with their orientation.\\" = In Europe = Weiss has travelled worldwide as an activist in various causes. In 1989 Weiss and others protested at a Carmelite convent that had been established at Auschwitz. The group‚Äîdressed in concentration camp clothing‚Äîscaled the walls of the convent, blew a shofar, and screamed anti-Nazi slogans. Workers evicted them from the site. In 1993 Pope John Paul II ordered the closure of the convent, which had been located in a converted building that had stored Zyklon B gas used to kill prisoners at the camp during World War II. He protested President Ronald Reagan's visit to an SS cemetery in 1985. He was arrested in 1990 while protesting Kurt Waldheim's visit to the Salzburg Festival, and again in 1994, when he protested in Oslo, Norway, when PLO chief Yasser Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize. Along with Rosa Sacharin of Glasgow, Scotland, Weiss sued the American Jewish Committee in New York state court in 2003 to stop the construction of a path through the Belzec extermination camp in Poland. They were concerned that mass graves at the site would be disturbed by the work.

The gallery features artwork of famous Icelandic artists and artwork that helps explain the traditional Icelandic culture. History The National Gallery of Iceland was founded in 1884 in Copenhagen, Denmark, by Bj√∂rn Bjarnarson. The collection consisted of donated artwork, mainly by Danish artists. The Al√æingish√∫s, where the collections were on show until 1950 The museum remained an independent institution from its inception in 1884 until 1916 when Al√æingi (the Icelandic Parliament) decided to make it a department in the National Heritage Museum (√ûj√≥√∞minjasafn √çslands). In 1928 a law was passed in Al√æingi on the Council of Culture, and under that law the National Gallery came under the supervision of the council. The collection was on show at the Al√æingish√∫s (the House of Parliament) from 1885 until 1950 when it was transferred to the building of the National Museum of Iceland at Su√∞urgata. There the collection was formally opened to the public in 1951, and in 1961 a law was passed making the museum fully independent. In 1987 the collection was moved again to Fr√≠kirkjuvegur 7. The main building was erected as a freezing plant in 1916, designed by Icelandic architect Gu√∞j√≥n Sam√∫elsson. A later addition to the building is the work of architect Gar√∞ar Halld√≥rsson. Exhibitions National Gallery of Iceland holds rotating exhibitions that reflect its collection or display work by individual artists, Icelandic as well as foreign ones. A variety of pieces from the National Gallery's collection are displayed in the first phase of the exhibition Millenium at The Culture House. The NG's buildings at Fr√≠kirkjuvegur 7 houses several exhibition halls on three floors, an art store, and a caf√©. The NG's offices are situated on Lauf√°svegur 12, adjacent to the exhibition halls.

Its chemical formula is C12H10N2O2, or C6H5NHC6H4NO2. It is a red crystalline solid, usually in form of flakes or powder, with melting point of 74-76 ¬∞C and boiling point of 346 ¬∞C. It is polar but hydrophobic. 2-Nitrodiphenylamine is used as a stabilizer for synthetic rubbers, explosives, propellants (e.g. in Otto fuel II, smokeless powders, in some US Army double-base propellants in solid rockets, and in other applications involving nitric acid esters), plastics, and lubricants. It is also an intermediate for organic synthesis, and a civilian solvent dye. In some explosives, it is used to control the explosion. One of its major uses is to control the explosion rate of propylene glycol dinitrate. As a stabilizer, its major role is to eliminate the acidic nitrates and nitrogen oxides produced by gradual decomposition of nitric acid esters, which would otherwise autocatalyze further decomposition. Its amount is usually 1-2% of the mixture; higher amounts than 2% degrade the propellant's ballistic properties. The amount of the stabilizer depletes with time; remaining content of less than 0.5% (with initial 2% content) requires increased surveillance of the munition, with less than 0.2% warranting immediate disposal, as the depletion of the stabilizer may lead to autoignition of the propellant. Other stabilizers of a similar nature are 4-nitrodiphenylamine, N-nitrosodiphenylamine. While N-methyl-p-nitroaniline(MNA also used in IMX-101), and diphenylamine(DPA) are more commonly employed.

He joined Millwall on a free transfer in September 1992. Moralee scored 20 goals in 76 appearances for Millwall in two seasons as they nearly gained promotion from Division One to the Premier League under Mick McCarthy. Moralee joined Watford for ¬£450,000 in the summer of 1994. Signed as a replacement for 1993‚Äì94 player of the season Paul Furlong, who had left for Chelsea, Moralee proved to be a disappointment, scoring seven times in 69 appearances over two seasons. Watford were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season and Moralee was given a free transfer. Moralee joined Crewe Alexandra, but played only 20 times in two seasons without scoring.

The character appeared in 26 episodes, starting with the first-season episode, \\"Cyrano Andy\\". Thelma Lou is portrayed by Betty Lynn. Thelma Lou lives in the community of Mayberry, North Carolina. She is Mayberry Deputy Sheriff Barney Fife's love interest. Thelma Lou appeared as a semiregular character in The Andy Griffith Show from 1961 until 1966, when the character was dropped from the show following the departure of Don Knotts and his Barney Fife character. She appeared in the 1986 reunion made-for-television movie, Return to Mayberry. Fictional character biography Little is known about Thelma Lou. Barney met Thelma Lou at Wilton Blair's funeral in 1960. In another episode, she is mentioned to have attended Mayberry Union High, graduating in the same class with Barney and Andy Taylor. Aside from her romance with Barney, she was given very little character development during the series' run. She is generally portrayed as a sweet-natured, somewhat touchy, caring person who genuinely has an understanding of Barney, despite his unbecoming antics and personality problems. She sings in the choir. She is apparently self-sufficient; her occupation is never revealed despite references to a never-seen \\"office\\", yet she lives in a roomy and well-decorated house of her own. Like most Mayberry ladies, she is an accomplished cook, being especially celebrated for her \\"cashew fudge\\" (a favorite of Barney's). Thelma Lou's last name is never given on the show, though in her last appearance on the series (\\"The Return of Barney Fife\\") she is married to a man named Gerald Whitfield. Actress Betty Lynn explained that \\"I didn't really need one, until about the fourth year, when Andy had to introduce me to a couple. And he turned to me during rehearsals, and Bob Sweeney was directing, and he said, 'Well, what's your last name? Thelma Lou what?' [laughs] And I said, 'No. I've been \\"Thelma Lou\\" all this time; I don't want a last name. ... All you have to do is say, \\"This is Thelma Lou.\\" You don't need a last name.' So, he said, 'Okay.' And that was it.\\" Prior to the arrival of Helen Crump in Mayberry, Lydia Crosswaithe is introduced as one of Thelma Lou's friends. Lydia's extremely odd personality doomed an effort by Barney and \\"Thel\\" to arrange a date and possible romantic match with Andy. Barney and Thelma Lou The stability of Barney and Thelma Lou's relationship is questionable. Barney dates other women besides Thelma Lou (mainly, diner waitress Juanita, who is mentioned, but never seen or heard). The two call it Splitsville in one episode when Barney pays a bit too much attention to an attractive newcomer to Mayberry. Despite their ups and downs, Thelma Lou stated that Barney was the man she wanted to marry and be the father of her children, and Barney once told Thelma Lou, \\"You're the only one I ever gave a hoot for.\\" He also tells her \\"You're the cat's\\" (as in \\"cat's meow\\"). A running gag on the show involved Barney and Thelma Lou spending a \\"quiet evening together\\" and somebody (usually Andy) walking in on them to find Barney's hair mussed and lipstick prints all over his face. Barney and Thelma Lou went their separate ways when Barney left Mayberry to join the Raleigh police force (coinciding with Don Knotts's departure from the series in 1965). In the sixth-season episode, \\"The Return of Barney Fife\\", Barney returns to Mayberry for a high-school reunion. Intent on getting back with Thelma Lou, Barney discovers she has been married six weeks to a man named Gerald Whitfield. Betty Lynn recounted that she so strongly objected to her character being married to anyone other than Barney that while performing in the episode, she pretended that Whitfield was actually a co-worker who she paid to pretend to be her husband so that she wouldn't \\"be left in a lurch\\" with Barney. This episode is Thelma Lou's final appearance on the series. Thelma Lou appears in the 1986 television reunion movie Return to Mayberry. Her marriage in 1965 is revealed to have lasted only a year before ending in divorce. Barney finally marries Thelma Lou.

When inspections reveal no apparent problems with the electrical system, Felix becomes obsessed with the continuing malfunctions of the elevator; this has a negative impact on his marriage as his wife Saskia (Josine van Dalsum) begins to suspect he is having an affair. When Felix pays yet another visit to the building, he notices a van parked outside from Rising Sun, a manufacturer of microprocessors for automation and a secret supplier of experimental microprocessors to Deta Liften. Felix and Mieke, after collecting newspaper clippings about Rising Sun, try to meet with the company's CEO, who acts nervous and answers abruptly. Mieke invites Felix to meet up with her former university professor who specializes in electronics. The professor explains microprocessors' sensitivity to external factors, such as electric fields, magnetic fields, and radioactivity, which undermine the proper functionality. He tells about a computer built years ago which suddenly begun to self-program and went out of control. The next morning, Felix's boss angrily suspends him for his unauthorized visit to Rising Sun. That evening, the owners of Deta Liften and Rising Sun meet to discuss how to stop the elevator's computer processor, which is built from organic material, from killing people. Saskia leaves Felix, taking their children with her. With nothing left to lose, Felix goes to the building to solve the elevator mystery. He discovers that the elevator has a sentient mind when it tries to prevent him from accessing its microprocessor. Instead Felix climbs into the elevator shaft and finds a pulsating box; inside is sticky goo covering a silicon chip‚Äîthe elevator's heart. As Felix attacks the box with a wrench, the elevator uses its counterweight to knock him off balance. He manages to land on a ledge just below the elevator doors, and is rescued by Mieke just before the elevator is able to crush him. As Rising Sun's CEO arrives to see that his experiment failed, he pulls out a pistol and fires into the biocomputer to seemingly kill it. The computer then shoots one of the broken cables out to drag him inside the shaft and hangs him. As a shaken Felix and Mieke walk down the stairs the elevator's heartbeat continues. Cast * Huub Stapel as Felix Adelaar * Willeke van Ammelrooy as Mieke de Beer * Josine van Dalsum as Saskia Adelaar Critical response Critical reception for De Lift has been mixed, with some commending the film for its blending of humor, and suspense; while others criticizing its execution. Variety Magazine in particular praised the film, writing, \\"Humor from charcoal gray to pitch black, fine suspense, murders and thrills, and all of it without gratuitous gore combine for a jaunty entertainment in The Lift, director Dick Maas‚Äô first theatrical test, which he passes handsomely.\\" Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews rated the film a grade B-, stating that the film was \\"Played more for a black comedy than for a corporate greed or menace film.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times was highly critical of the film, calling it \\"remarkably tension- free\\", and criticized its execution as being \\"too tepid\\". Maslin further stated, \\"In the hands of the right film maker, of course, even a toaster can be terrifying. But Mr. Maas leaves the elevator's potential fiendishness largely unexploited.\\" Time Out London gave the film a negative review, writing \\"the movie is shafted by confusions of script and execution, neither of which match up to the original good idea.\\" TV Guide awarded the film a mixed two out of five stars, stating that the film was \\"Surprisingly effective\\", while also stating that it was not particularly scary.

(A paix√£o segundo G.H.) is a mystical novel by Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, published in 1964. The work takes the form of a monologue by a woman, identified only as G.H., telling of the crisis that ensued the previous day after she crushed a cockroach in the door of a wardrobe. Its canonical status was recognized in 1988 by its inclusion in the Arquivos Collection, the UNESCO series of critical editions of the greatest works of Latin American literature. It has been translated into English twice, the first time in 1988 by Ronald W. Sousa,Clarice Lispector. Passion according to G.H. (Exxon Lecture Series), Univ Of Minnesota Press; 1 edition (September 15, 1988). and then by Idra Novey in 2012.Idra Novey (Translator), Benjamin Moser (Preface). The Passion According to G.H., New Directions (May 8, 2012). Background and publication The novel was written in a quick burst at the end of 1963, following a period of difficulty in Lispector's life. \\"It's strange,\\" she remembered, \\"because I was in the worst of situations, sentimentally as well as in my family, everything complicated, and I wrote The Passion, which has nothing to do with that.\\" The novel was published in the following year by Editora do Author, which was run by Lispector's friends Rubem Braga and Fernando Sabino. Plot summary When the book opens, G.H., a well-to-do resident of a Rio de Janeiro penthouse, reminisces on what happened to her the previous day, when she decided to clean out the room occupied by the maid, who had just quit. \\"Before I entered the room, what was I?\\" G.H. asks. \\"I was what others had always seen me be, and that was the way I knew myself.\\" In the maid's room, G.H. expects chaos. Instead, to her shock, she finds a desert; \\"an entirely clean and vibrating room as in an insane asylum from which dangerous objects have been removed\\". Only one thing disturbs the room's perfect order: black carbon scratches on the dry white wall, outlining a man, a woman, and a dog. Pondering the inscrutable drawing, she realizes that the black maid, whose name she has forgotten, and whose face she has trouble calling to mind, had hated her. Overwhelmed by anger, she opens the door to the wardrobe. Terrified by the cockroach she sees emerging, she slams the door shut, severing the cockroach in its centre, and sees the still-living animal's entrails beginning to ooze out. G.H. is appalled by the sight, but she is trapped in the room by the irresistible fascination for the dying insect. She wants to scream, but she knows it is already too late: \\"If I raised the alarm at being alive, voiceless and hard they would drag me away since they drag away those who depart the possible world, the exceptional being is dragged away, the screaming being [sic].\\" Staring at the insect, her human personality begins to break down; finally, at the height of her mystic crisis, she famously takes the matter oozing from the cockroach ‚Äî the fundamental, anonymous matter of the universe which she shares with the roach ‚Äî and puts it in her mouth. Literary significance and criticism The book's shocking d√©nouement has made it famous in Brazil, but it is its description of the breakdown of G.H.'s personality and the mystical crisis, couched in Lispector's unmistakable language, that has made the novel one of the most important works of Brazilian fiction. Shortly before her death, Lispector told a reporter that of all her books G.H. was the one that \\"best corresponded to her demands as a writer\\". Many critics have agreed, and few Brazilian authors have failed to comment on it, as the extensive bibliography in the UNESCO edition, edited by philosopher Benedito Nunes, indicates. Ronald W. Sousa, translator of the novel from Portuguese to English, re-examines the way most criticism addresses the key issue of the language dynamics of the novel. Rather than seeing the dynamics in a Romantic or avant-garde position, Sousa poses that Lispector does not seek to remake language but rather seeks to work within it. Throughout the novel, \\"G.H. explores before our eyes some of the key oppositions upon which language is built.\\"Sousa, Ronald W. \\"At the Site of Language: Reading Lispector's G.H.\\" Chasqui: revista de literature latinoamericana 18.2 (1989): 43‚Äì48. Literary techniques To accompany the irregular plot and substance of the novel, Lispector uses unique techniques to help convey her overarching ideas and themes. Like most of her works, The Passion According to G.H. is divided into many sections, but it differs since the last sentence of every chapter is also the beginning of the next. This separates the chapters, giving them the semblance of a collection of short stories. However, it also connects the discrete parts of the novel, as if saying that every end is also a beginning ‚Äì something that accompanies Lispector's motifs of time and eternity. Additionally, the narrator is only referred to as 'I', and remains undefined even towards the end of the book. As opposed to most literature, the narrator is not important as a human subject, but rather as a mode to express ideas that are beyond and above the human. Thus Lispector implies that G.H.'s perspective in the novel is not limited to her but is representative of the human species and its breakdown.

It was built by Harry Culver, the founder of Culver City, and opened on September 4, 1924, with local headlines announcing: \\"City packed with visitors for opening of Culver skyscraper.\\" Originally named Hotel Hunt, and later known as Culver City Hotel, the six-story Renaissance Revival building was designed by Curlett & Beelman, the architecture firm behind renowned Art Deco buildings throughout Los Angeles, including downtown Los Angeles' Roosevelt and Eastern Columbia buildings. As Culver City became a movie-making mecca in the 1920s and beyond, the hotel welcomed many legendary stars, some maintaining private residences for months at a time. Culver himself kept his office there. Over the next few decades, the property fell into disrepair. In the 1980s, it was boarded up for a time and at risk of demolition. In the 1990s, the hotel was partially restored and reopened, joining the National Register of Historic Places in 1997, but the Culver Hotel's modern comeback truly began after a hotelier family bought the ailing property in 2007. Since 2007, the hotel's entire plumbing and electrical systems have been upgraded, each of the guestrooms and public spaces have been redone, all 140 handmade windows in the guest rooms have been replaced, and the public spaces have been entirely re-imagined all the while maintaining the property's architectural integrity. The Culver Hotel also hosts live jazz and special events. The flatiron-shaped building is next door to the historic Culver Studios and a few blocks from the Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios, now Sony Pictures. The Culver Hotel has appeared in a wide array of films and television programs, including the Our Gang short Honkey Donkey, The Wonder Years, Party of Five, 7th Heaven, Last Action Hero, Sledge Hammer!, Stuart Little 2, Bones, Cougar Town and Touch. Today numerous television shows, movies or commercials still shoot in and around Culver City, with parts of the hotel's exterior and interior having doubled for a street in London, an apartment in Barcelona or a caf√© in Paris. Owners The hotel was built by Harry Culver, the founder of Culver City, on the site of the city's first movie theater. Mr. Culver's original office and vault are still on the second floor. The hotel was later owned by Charlie Chaplin, who, legend has it, lost the property in a poker game to John Wayne, who owned the hotel for several years and eventually donated it to the YMCA. The Culver Hotel was restored and reopened by Lou Catlett in the mid 1990s and was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The property was then purchased by Abraham Hu who ran it, in conjunction with his son Xing and Nightclub Restaurateur Eddie Harrah, for several years until 2007. The Culver was then sold to the Mallick family. Maya Mallick renovated it. The Culver Hotel is now a 4-star boutique hotel offering 46 guest rooms, a bar and dining scene, meeting and event spaces and live music every evening. Residents The Culver Hotel has housed many stars as guests, including Clark Gable, Mickey Rooney, Greta Garbo, Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, Lana Turner, Red Skelton, Buster Keaton, Dorothy Dandridge, Douglas Fairbanks, Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, all 4 members of the boy band 98 Degrees, Abby Lee Miller of Dance Moms, Countess Luann de Lesseps from Real Housewives of New York City some even maintaining private residences for months at a time. Dwight D. Eisenhower even had a campaign office in the hotel during his run for President in 1952. The nearby Jazz Bakery has been known to put up world-renowned musicians at the Culver Hotel as well. Casts from Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz stayed at the hotel during filming, including the more than 100 actors and actresses who played the Munchkins in the Oz film.

Zhulebino was opened on 9 November 2013. The construction lasted for two years. The station was to be opened on 6 November 2013, however due to a technical failure of a train at neighbouring Lermontovsky Prospekt station it was delayed until the 9th. Its location is outside the Moscow Ring Road beltway. The station is located underground although the track from Vykhino is at the surface for a part of the path. The territory at which the station currently located was until 1984 a part of the town of Lyubertsy of Moscow Oblast. In 1984 it was transferred to Moscow, and subsequently rapid urban development started. The whole area, along with Lyubertsy and other areas along the Kazansky and Ryazansky suburban directions of Moscow Railway were strongly dependent on the station of Vykhino, then the terminus of the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line and a transfer station to both railway directions. In the 2000s, Vykhino was heavily overloaded. Eventually, the decision was taken to extend the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line beyond Vykhino. The construction of the first stretch, with the stations of Lermontovsky Prospekt and Zhulebino, started in August 2011. The tunnels were completed by September 2013. Zhulebino was the terminus until 21 September 2015, when the new terminus at Kotelniki was opened.

Overview  Designed by Cryptography Research, Inc. of San Francisco, SPDC executes code from the encrypted content on the DVD player, enabling the content providers to change DRM systems in case an existing system is compromised. It adds functionality to make the system \\"dynamic\\", as opposed to \\"static\\" systems in which the system and keys for encryption and decryption do not change, thus enabling one compromised key to decode all content released using that encryption system. \\"Dynamic\\" systems attempt to make future content released immune to existing methods of circumvention. Playback method If a method of playback used in previously released content is revealed to have a weakness, either by review or because it has already been exploited, code embedded into content released in the future will change the method, and any attackers will have to start over and attack it again. Targeting compromised players If a certain model of players are compromised, code specific to the model can be activated to verify that the particular player has not been compromised. The player can be \\"fingerprinted\\" if found to be compromised and the information can be used later. Forensic marking Code inserted into content can add information to the output that specifically identifies the player, and in a large-scale distribution of the content, can be used to trace the player. This may include the fingerprint of a specific player.  Weaknesses  If an entire class of players is compromised, it is infeasible to revoke the ability to use the content on the entire class because many customers may have purchased players in the class. A fingerprint may be used to try to work around this limitation, but an attacker with access to multiple sources of video may \\"scrub\\" the fingerprint, removing the fingerprint entirely or rendering it useless at the very least. Because dynamic execution requires a virtual environment, it may be possible to recreate an execution environment on a general purpose computer that feeds the executing code whatever an attacker wants the code to see in terms of digital fingerprints and memory footprints. This allows players running on general purpose computers to emulate any specific model of player, potentially by simply downloading firmware updates for the players being emulated. Once the emulated execution environment has decrypted the content, it can then be stored in decrypted form. Because the content encryption scheme (such as BD+) is separate from the transport encryption scheme (such as HDCP), digital content is transferred inside the player between circuits in unencrypted form. It is possible to extract digital data directly from circuit traces inside a licensed and legal player before that content has been re-encrypted for transport across the wire, allowing a modified player to be used as a decryption device for protected content. Only one such device must exist for the content to be widely distributed over digital networks such as the Internet. The final weakness of all DRM schemes for noninteractive works is the ultimate decryption for display to end-users. The content can at that time be re-encoded as a digital file. The presumption is that re-encoding is lossy, but fully digital copies can be made with modified viewing devices. For example, HDCP to unencrypted DVI adapters exist on the market and can be used by infringers to re-encode digital copies without modifying players. There also exists adapters that will split HDCP-encumbered HDMI stream into a non- encrypted DVI and S/PDIF streams, both digital, allowing for next-to-lossless reconstruction of digital copies witn complete video and audio streams. Further, infringers can make copies through the analog hole. Modern HD televisions are merely 2 megapixels in resolution and the HD specification will be static for at least two decades, as high-expense consumer product cycles are necessarily long and higher resolution provides decreasing benefit to the consumer. By the time the specification is mid-life, cameras with 20 megapixel resolution will be available and able to record full-motion video, allowing for full two-axis oversampling and software reconstruction of the original stream pixel-by-pixel, with the only analog losses being encoded as slight variations in pixel colorand even this loss can be compensated for with color profile adjustment after the re-encode has completed. It would not be possible to compensate for possible compression of the color space dynamic, however, leading to a slight posterizing effect. This effect is already apparent in compressed video and does not seem to bother most consumers.

He played college football at Stanford University. Early years Hill was a high school quarterback at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where he followed in the footsteps of an earlier-day record passer, Gene Washington. He broke most of Washington's high school passing records, and then followed him to Stanford University, where he was converted into a wide receiver, and again broke most of Washington's receiving records. As a senior, he had an ankle injury against Penn State University, that forced him to miss the University of Michigan game and be limited in the next two contests. He ranks eleventh on Stanford's records with 2,225 career receiving yards. He also had 140 receptions, 18 touchdowns and graduated with a 3.3 GPA in Political Science at the age of 20. He was inducted into the Stanford Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Hill was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (62nd overall) of the 1977 NFL Draft. He started his career as a punt returner and backup wide receiver, winning a championship ring with the Cowboys when they defeated the Denver Broncos 27-10 in Super Bowl XII. The following season he became a starting wide receiver over the more-experienced Golden Richards and Butch Johnson. At the end of the season, he made the Pro Bowl, after catching 46 passes for 823 yards and 6 touchdowns, while helping the team to their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance. In Dallas' 35‚Äì31 Super Bowl XIII loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, he caught 2 passes for 49 yards and a touchdown. Known for his quick speed and big play ability, Coach Tom Landry called him ‚ÄúOur Home Run Hitter. I‚Äôve never seen a guy who could adjust to a ball in mid-air like Tony. He is a very explosive player-the type who can turn a short play into a big play in a hurry, because he has excellent running ability and speed.‚Äù In 1979, he and Drew Pearson‚Äîalong with Tony Dorsett‚Äîhelped the Cowboys become the first team in NFL history to have two 1,000-yards wide receivers and a 1,000-yard running back, when he recorded 60 receptions, 1,062 yards and 10 touchdowns. Pearson and Hill also became the first wide receiver tandem in Cowboys history, to record 1,000-yard receiving seasons in the same year. Hill became the number one receiver when Pearson retired after the 1983 season. His best season statistically came in 1985, where he caught 74 passes for 1100 receiving yards and 7 touchdowns. He eventually became one of the top wide receivers in the NFL from 1978 to 1985, and was dubbed the \\"Thrill\\" and \\"Dial 80\\", because of his explosiveness and ability to make big plays. A three-time Pro Bowl selection, during his ten-year career with the Cowboys, Hill led the team in both receptions and yardage for nine straight years. He never played in a Super Bowl again, but played in 10 more postseason games. One of the better performances in his career was in a 1982 divisional playoff game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, when he caught 7 passes for 142 yards in the Cowboys' 38‚Äì0 win. He was waived by the Cowboys in 1987 at the start of training camp. His 8,072 total yards (rushing and receiving), ranks him fifth in the Cowboys All-Time list in that category, behind Hall of Famers Tony Dorsett, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin and current tight end Jason Witten. At the time he ranked first in receiving yards, second in receiving touchdowns and second in receptions in Dallas Cowboys history. =San Francisco 49ers= On July 24, 1987, the San Francisco 49ers outbid the Los Angeles Rams for his services, but he never played another regular season game, after he was released on September 7. Hill finished his 10 NFL seasons with 479 receptions for 7,988 yards and 51 touchdowns in 142 games. He also had 26 100-yard receiving games, rushed for 84 yards, returned 27 punts for 268 yards, and gained 96 yards on 4 kickoff returns. For his career, he averaged 16.1 yards per touch and 16.7 yards per reception. Television appearances In 2000, Hill appeared as a contestant on the short-lived game show Greed. He did not win any money after he got sacked on his $500,000 question as the team's captain. The question was: Which four and their affiliates have the highest global market share? The seven choices were General Motors, Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Toyota, and BMW. Honda, BMW and Hyundai were the incorrect answers. On June 23, 2011 (his birthday), Hill appeared on Good Morning Texas to promote the Market Street Allen USA Celebration, a Fourth of July celebration held annually the last weekend of June in his hometown, Allen, Texas. In honor of headline entertainer Lou Gramm, Hill showcased his singing voice by performing a small portion of one of Foreigner's hit songs, \\"Hot Blooded\\". Broadcasting Hill was the color commentator for ArenaBowl V on Prime Network and was the color commentator for America One's Canadian Football League broadcasts during the Canadian Media Guild strike. He also serves as a color commentator on the Compass Media Networks for NFL and college football. Personal life Hill is the CEO of Legends Sports Promotions, Inc., a company that raises funds for charitable organizations through celebrity basketball, softball, and football games as well as golf tournaments. It also manages athletes for motivational and promotional events. He is currently employed by the City of Allen Parks and Recreation Department as a Resource Development Manager. Hill and his wife Millie have four children: Cassidy, Kelli, Leslie, and Anthony. Cassidy attended Texas State University. Kelli played basketball at Southwestern University. Leslie played soccer at Iowa State University and was named offensive player of the year her senior year. Anthony received a basketball scholarship to Colgate University but transferred to Houston Baptist University after his sophomore year.

Named after the River Severn, the ship was the first to bear the name in 56 years. She was built by Vosper Thornycroft in Southampton to serve primarily as a fishery protection unit within the United Kingdom's waters along with her two sister ships and . All three were commissioned into service in 2003 to replace the five older s. Construction Severn was built by Vosper Thorneycroft Shipbuilding at its shipyard in Woolston, Southampton. Following construction, she was launched on 1 January 2003 as the second vessel of her class. Along with her sister ships, she was among the first vessels to be privately-funded by industry and leased to the Royal Navy for five years. On expiry of this lease, the Royal Navy had the option to either purchase the vessels or return them to VT. On 31 July 2003, Severn was commissioned into the Royal Navy in a ceremony attended by her Lady Sponsor Miss Vicky Anderson in Portsmouth. Operational history Severn undertook her first fishery protection patrol in September 2003. She was also affiliated with the Welsh city of Newport during the same month and awarded the Freedom of the City in June 2006. Between 2005 and 2006, Severn spent a total of 225 days at sea on fishery protection duties, her busiest year to date. In September 2012, Severn was purchased by the Royal Navy, along with her sister ships, after her lease had expired. HMS Severn in Bordeaux, France In October 2014, it was announced that Severn would be the first River- class vessel to deploy overseas to take up the Atlantic Patrol Tasking North, a task traditionally assigned to a frigate or destroyer. Arriving in the Caribbean, Severn patrolled the waters of each British Overseas Territory in the region and was on standby to provide any support, ranging from disaster relief to tackling all forms of illicit trafficking. The ship returned to Portsmouth on 16 July 2015, having visited all of the British Overseas Territories in the region. In December 2015, acting on intelligence from the British National Crime Agency and French DNRED, the ship intercepted the MV Carib Palm off the south coast of the United Kingdom and escorted the ship to Boulogne-sur-Mer, France where it was searched by French customs. The search uncovered of cocaine with a street value in excess of ¬£350m. In April 2017, Severn was detached from fishery protection duties to escort the Russian Navy landing ship Korolev through the English Channel. =Decommissioning and reactivation= After making what was presumed to be her final visit to her affiliated town of Newport, Severn was decommissioned at HMNB Portsmouth on 27 October 2017. In March 2018 ‚Äî six months since decommissioning ‚Äî the Ministry of Defence announced that ¬£12.7 million had been allocated from the EU Exit Preparedness Fund to preserve Severn and her two sister ships, should they be required to control and enforce UK waters and fisheries following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. In November 2018, Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, confirmed that Severn and her sister ships would be reactivated and \\"forward operated\\" from their affiliated ports. =Post- reactivation= Severn underwent a refit in May 2020 in preparation for her planned recommissioning. Following this, she officially recommissioned on 30 June 2020. Despite plans to forward-operate Severn from her affiliated port, the ship remained base ported in Portsmouth as of 4 February 2020. After passing her Operational Sea Training (OST) assessment, Severn returned to operations in July 2020. One of her first operational taskings since rejoining the fleet saw her shadowing Russian Navy destroyer Vice-Admiral Kulakov, corvette Vasily Bykov and their two support ships as they transited through the English Channel in 9 July 2020.

Anyone can use this restroom, regardless of gender identity or expression\\". The term unisex public toilets, also called gender-inclusive, gender-neutral and mixed-sex or all-gender toilets, bathrooms or restrooms, or just toilets, refers to public toilets that are not separated by gender or sex. Unisex public toilets can benefit a range of people with or without special needs (e.g. people with disabilities, the elderly, and anyone who needs the help of someone of another gender or sex). They are also valuable for parents who need to help their infant or young child with using the toilet. While the push for gender neutral bathrooms benefits a number of different demographics, it is driven by the transgender community to combat harassment and violence against these populations. Unisex public toilets take different forms. They may be single occupancy facilities where only one single room or enclosure is provided, or multi-user facilities which are open to all and where users may either share sinks in an open area or each have their own sink in their private cubicle, stall or room. Unisex public toilets may either replace single-sex toilets or may be an addition to single-sex toilets. Unisex public toilets can be used by people of any sex, gender or gender identity, i.e. male, female, transgender, intersex. Such toilet facilities can benefit transgender populations and people outside of the gender binary. Sex- separation in public toilets (also called sex segregation), as opposed to unisex toilets, is the separation of public toilets into male and female. This separation is sometimes enforced by local laws and building codes. Key differences between male and female public toilets in most western countries include the presence of urinals for men and boys, and sanitary bins for the disposal of menstrual hygiene products for women and girls. Sanitary bins may easily be included in the setup of unisex public toilets. The historical purposes of sex-separated toilets in the United States and Europe, as well as the timing of their appearance, are disputed amongst scholars. Safety from sexual harassment and privacy were likely two main goals of sex-separation of public toilets, and factors such as morality also played roles. Paternalism and resistance to women entering the workplace might have also played a role. Some women's groups are worried that unisex public toilets will be less safe for women than public toilets that are separated by sex. Transgender activists have long been pushing for gender neutral bathrooms in order to provide safe spaces for those outside the gender binary. Terminology Gender neutral toilet sign at department of sociology, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden Several alternative terms are in use for unisex public toilets. Some favor all-gender toilets, gender neutral toilets, gender free toilets or all- user toilets or just toilet. The \\"Public Toilet Advocacy Toolkit\\" by the NGO Public Hygiene Lets Us Stay Human (PHLUSH) in Portland, Oregon (United States) from 2015 uses the term \\"all-gender\\". More recently, they have changed to the term \\"all user\\". However, some object to the term \\"gender-neutral\\" and similar terms, believing that neither the spaces nor the terms are truly neutral. They also object to the replacement of the word \\"sex\\" with the word \\"gender.\\" Such people often express a preference for the term \\"mixed-sex.\\" But whatever one calls them, these are toilets which can (in theory) be used by anybody, regardless of sex, gender identity or presentation. The opposite of unisex toilets is referred to as either \\"sex-separated\\" or \\"sex-segregated\\" toilets, or \\"conventional public toilets\\" (since sex separation is currently mostly the norm on the global level). In the United States some scholars have used the term \\"sex separation\\". Robert B.

Unisex public toilet at Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco, US. The sinks in the foreground are shared by all users. Family toilet interior at Hong Kong Tuen Mun Castle Peak Road, Hanford Garden Plaza. The smaller toilet is for children. = Types = Some unisex public toilets are designed to be used by people with disabilities and have either individual or gender-neutral facilities. They can accommodate people with disabilities, elderly people who may require assistance from a carer of another gender, or other cases where public sex-segregated facilities might lead to discomfort. Toilet facilities for disabled people, especially those reliant on a wheelchair, may be either unisex or gender-specific. Unisex public toilets are also common in cases where space is limited, such as in aircraft lavatories and passenger train toilets. Several types can be distinguished: * Single occupancy where only one room or enclosure is provided. This room could be used by several people at once, e.g. a whole family, a carer helping a person needing help. * Multi-user facilities which are open to all and where users may either share sinks in an open area or each have their own sink in their private cubicle, stall or room. * The re-labelling of existing multi-cubicle public toilets, with no real change. This approach was taken in one area at the Barbican Centre in the UK, where some toilets became shared. = Toilets = If more than one toilet fixture is available in a unisex public toilet, the toilet seats or squatting pans are installed in enclosed cubicles in the same way as in sex-segregated toilets. To ensure visual privacy, these may be provided with floor-to-ceiling walls. = Sinks = Sinks are commonly installed in open arrangement as in sex-segregated toilets and used collectively by people of all gender.Huesmann, M. (2016). Transgressing Gender Binarism in the Workplace? Including Transgender and Intersexuality Perspectives in Organizational Restroom Policies. In Sexual Orientation and Transgender Issues in Organizations (pp. 539-552). Springer, Cham Alternatively, a sink can be provided in each cubicle or toilet room, e.g. where the unisex toilet is set up to be used by families and carers. The latter arrangement is more friendly to people requiring to use the sink in a manner calling for a degree of privacy, or taking off items of dress typically worn in public. Examples are: emergency removing menstrual blood stains from clothingStampler, Laura (2017-09-28) 6 Women Share How They Handled Period Leaks In Public, Women's Health https://www.womenshealthmag.com/, refreshing upper body - face, underarms over the sink, or applying makeup, combing, styling hair. = Urinals = The issue of urinals is creating somewhat of a conundrum for many unisex public toilet designers. In many public toilets, the widespread use of urinals for males means that there are more opportunities to meet their needs. There are often queues in front of the toilet rooms for females but not in front of the toilet rooms for males. While toilets are usually located in cubicles with lockable doors, urinals are usually installed freely in rows in sex-separated toilet rooms. This construction leads to a smaller space consumption and thus to more possibilities for water-efficient urination, while promoting more sanitary restroom conditions for men/boys at work/school and elsewhere. Urinals have primarily been offered in public toilets for males, with female urinals being only a niche product. Abolishing all urinals would sacrifice resource advantages and convenience for male users, without improving sanitation or wait time for females. Another possibility would be to offer separate male and female urinals or unisex urinals that can be used by males and females alike, which allows increased flexibility of use. Yet this would raise the problem of arrangement. One option would be to continue to offer urinals in rows, with separation by screens. However, it is questionable whether the less private environment, compared to cubicle toilets, would be met with acceptance. Due to socio-cultural conventions, the concept of men/boys urinating with their backs visible to women/girls would possibly create awkwardness for both genders, and would currently seem strange and contrary to common morals and etiquette for many users. There are other practical issues for females, such as women/girls needing toilet paper, having to lower their pants, and sometimes tending to their menstrual hygiene needs while going to the toilet for urination. An alternative would be to accommodate urinals for both sexes in cubicles or to continue to offer them only in public toilets for males. However, this would at least limit the above-mentioned advantages of urinals. Urinals arranged in cubicles have rarely been installed; the advantages over conventional toilets were not obvious because the same space would still be required in the new arrangement. With all things considered, many unisex public toilet designers are now creating plans in which urinals would be constructed in an isolated section or corner of the toilet room, so that they would not be directly visible to anyone in other areas of the public toilet. This is seen by many public toilet designers as the best possible solution that would balance efficiency with modesty. = Building-related advantages = Especially where space is limited, the double design of the sanitary facilities is not possible or only possible to a limited extent. Unisex toilets are often used in many public transport systems, such as rail vehicles or airplanes. Unisex public toilets are less problematic to use by caretakers of dependents (who include very young children, the elderly, and the mentally and physically disabled) to enter the toilet room together with their charge. Women/girls often spend more time in toilet rooms than men/boys, both for physiological and cultural reasons. The requirement to use a cubicle rather than a urinal means that urination takes longer and sanitation is a far greater issue, often requiring more thorough hand washing. Females also make more visits to toilets. Urinary tract infections and incontinence are more common in females. Pregnancy, menstruation, breastfeeding, and diaper-changing increase usage. The elderly, who are disproportionately female, due to men dying earlier in their old age than females, make longer and more frequent toilet visits. Unisex public toilets can alleviate this problem by providing equal sanitation space for all genders, eliminating the prospect of unused cubicles in the male toilets. Some argue that a two-tier system is also generated via what they called the \\"toilet apartheid\\" by excluding women/girls from important social networking processes in male toilets.Jo Greene: It‚Äôs Time To Get Rid Of Gender-Specific Toilets  Thought Catalog In: thoughtcatalog.com Important agreements and decisions by men/boys are sometimes made at the urinal where females are currently excluded.Kate Wheeling: Stalled Out: How Social Bias Is Segregating America's Bathrooms - The Pacific Standard = Building-related disadvantages = The consolidation of previously gender-separated toilets or the construction of new unisex toilets is sometimes resisted due to administrative and building law difficulties. Also, where public toilets are located are sometimes dictated by existing plumbing design. If the only way to build unisex public toilets is to locate them in isolated spaces a long way from people in charge of supervising the space, such a design may be objectionable on safety grounds. Some argue that laws requiring that women and men be treated the same in public toilet access is unfair. Since the 1980s, \\"potty parity\\" activists campaigned for laws requiring more female-designated public toilets than male-designated public toilets in public buildings, based on the idea that women require more time to use the toilet and thus women's toilets tend to have longer lines. California passed the first law of this kind in 1987, and as of 2009 twenty states in the US have passed similar legislation. Locations  =At private companies= Unless prohibited by law (and when required by law), private companies can provide unisex toilets. =At educational institutions = The Stonewall Centre, an LGBTQ advocacy group, says that certain people feel threatened using facilities that do not adhere to their gender identity, and that this can become an issue when students are harassed by their peers. Advocates argue that forcing trans / non-binary students to use normative gendered public toilets can stigmatize them daily by singling them out. Once again, the response of those opposing such spaces, or opposing them as the norm is safety and privacy for women.  United States  Many colleges and universities (such as Oberlin College in Ohio) have had unisex public toilets as early as 2000. Overwhelmingly, institutions that offer unisex spaces still also offer sex-separated spaces. The University of California at Los Angeles offers more than 160 unisex toilets on campus, but all are single stall. Other collegiate institutions have moved toward creating some unisex public toilets. According to a University of Massachusetts Amherst LGBTQ advocacy organization, The Stonewall Centre, there were more than 150 campuses in the US in 2014 with unisex public toilets. In February 2016, Michigan was the first state in the US to pass a bill that forces transgender students in public schools to use sanitation facilities that correspond with their 'chromosomes and anatomy' at birth. The University of Oklahoma continually adds unisex toilets to their campus to accommodate students who may require use of a less excessively gendered public toilet. (Students that fit under this umbrella may identify as non-heterosexual). As of February 2014, the university had 13 unisex toilets. There are over 150 college campuses across the US that are creating unisex public toilets. In March 2016, New York City private college Cooper Union moved to remove gender designations from campus toilets. In October 2016, University of California Berkeley converted several public toilets into unisex toilets. In March 2017 Yelp announced that they will add a unisex public toilet finder feature on their app. Yelp was one of over 50 companies that signed an amicus curiae brief in favor of a transgender high school student Gavin Grimm who claims that his school board denied him access to the boys' toilet in school and thereby violating Title IX. HRC president Chad Griffin stated on the brief that \\"These companies are sending a powerful message to transgender children and their families that America's leading businesses have their backs.\\"  United Kingdom  In 2015, unisex toilets were set to be introduced into every new school to be built in Scotland in a campaign to eradicate bullying. All future primary and secondary schools will have non-sex-separated toilets. In March 2017, the Glasgow City Council announced that toilets in school will no longer be labeled as 'girls' and 'boys' but instead be labelled as unisex to help students who may be struggling with the issue of gender identity. This will be implemented in three schools first. In the United Kingdom, unisex public toilets are sometimes found on university campuses. In early 2013, Brighton and Hove city council introduced unisex toilets. British universities including Bradford Union, Sussex and Manchester, had already or were in the process of building unisex facilities in 2011. Legislation and country examples Toilet sign for \\"unisex ambulant toilet\\" (accessible toilet) at a park in Brisbane, Australia Toilet block at a park in Brisbane, Australia: the toilet block has two cubicles, both marked as unisex and accessible toilets, and a sink outside of the cubicles for handwashing. =Canada= In April 2014, the Vancouver Park Board decided to install unisex toilets in public buildings, with different signs to identify them. Amongst the options discussed was the rainbow triangle (based on the pink triangle used during the Holocaust), an \\"all-inclusive\\" gender symbol, an icon representing a toilet or the phrases \\"washroom\\" or \\"gender-neutral washroom\\" placed on the entrances to the toilets. According to Global News, a Canadian online newspaper, many different regions across Canada offer unisex toilets and other gender-neutral facilities, but Vancouver was the first municipality to change building codes to require unisex toilets be built in public buildings. This movement, according to commissioner Trevor Loke, was aimed to make everyone feel welcomed and included: \\"We think that the recommendation of universal washrooms is a good idea [...] [w]e will be using more inclusive language based on the BC Human Rights Code.\\" Some initiatives to make public toilets more diverse and inclusive have focused on language simply by using the phrases \\"toilet\\" or \\"gender-neutral toilet\\" in order to be inclusive of all genders and gender identities, or using specifically geared language such as \\"women and trans women\\" as opposed to just \\"women\\" (and vice versa for men and trans men). =China= Unisex toilets have appeared in China since before 2013 in Shenyang and Chengdu by 2015. In 2016 that Shanghai China opened its first public unisex toilet near the Zhangjiabin River in a park, in the Pudong district. Many of these toilets have opened in high-traffic areas for the convenience of all users as rather than specifically for the benefit of sexual minorities. In May 2016 a Beijing- based non-governmental organization launched an 'All Gender Toilets' campaign to bring awareness to this issue in China. This resulted in around 30 locations opening unisex public toilets. = India = In 2014 the Indian Supreme Court gave transgender people, also known as 'hijras', recognition with a third gender. This legislation included creating separate toilets for transgender people in public spaces where transgender people are often met with violence and hostility. T he two-judge Supreme Court bench was led by Justice KS Radhakrishnan, who said, \\"The court order gives legal sanctity to the third gender. The judges said the government must make sure that they have access to medical care and other facilities like separate wards in hospitals and separate toilets\\". In 2017 The Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation sent out guidelines to the Swachh Bharat Mission decreeing that members who are part of the transgender community should be allowed to use the public toilet they are most comfortable with. The central government has allowed transgender people to use the toilets of their choice in public and community toilets. This does not ensure safety from violence. = Japan = \\"Toilets for anyone\\" in Japan As of 2016, no laws were in place regarding the usage of public toilets in relation to gender identity. There may, however, be occasional signs outside public toilets to indicate that the stall is \\"gender free\\". The Tokyo city government was planning to install one unisex toilet in at least seven out of eleven of the buildings being used for the Olympic Games that were planned for 2020. = Nepal = MP Sunil Babu Pant used part of the Parliamentarian Development Fund to build the first two unisex toilets in Nepalganj, one of which is in Bageshwori Park. Starting in 2014 The Nepal Country Report, A Participatory Review and Analysis of the Legal and Social Environment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Persons and Civil Society recommended that in schools separate toilets or unisex toilets should be built for transgender students. = Thailand = The term \\"kathoeys\\" used to describe effeminate male-bodied people, for whom schools have started opening sex-separated toilets for since 2003. After legislation passed, in 2004 a private vocational college in Chiang Mai Thailand gave 15 'kathoey' students the opportunity to use toilet facilities that were solely for them, referred to as 'pink lotus' public toilets. Alliance organizations in Thailand such as the Thai Transgender Alliance and the Transferral Association of Thailand were created to support kathoey people such as by helping create separate public toilet facilities. =United States= There are unisex toilets in some public spaces in the United States. Cooper Union of New York City, New York was the first college in the country to de-gender all of their campus bathrooms in 2015. Despite this, transgender and non-conforming gendered people are still sometimes subject to visual or verbal scrutiny; this is reinforced by the architectural design and heteronormative gendered codes of conduct that are still present within the US. On the federal level, the US Department of Labor is in charge of workplace toilets, which means setting state guidelines through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). For non-work related public toilet guidelines, the Department of Health and Human Services governs regulations. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\\"EEOC\\") has also played a role in interpreting federal statutes and enforcing them. Two statutes relevant to public toilets are Title VII (nondiscrimination in the workplace) and Title IX (nondiscrimination in educational opportunity based on sex). Building codes may be adopted by statute or regulation. They may require sex-separation or they may require unisex toilets. New building codes usually do not apply retroactively. Thus, building owners may choose not to update existing features because it allows them to continue following the older building codes that govern those older features. These regulations are mostly based on the precedent created by original legislation. They sometimes also work to eliminate the longer wait time females often face by creating a ratio of more female toilets than male toilets.  US local ordinances  In most jurisdictions, local governments have the ability to pass ordinances, so long as they do not conflict with state law. San Francisco (California), Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Seattle (Washington), Washington (District of Columbia), West Hollywood (California), Austin (Texas), Cleveland (Ohio), New York City, and the US states of Vermont, New Mexico, New York State, Illinois, and California - have passed measures mandating that single-occupancy toilets in public spaces be labeled as unisex (or gender-neutral).Steinmetz, Katy. \\"The Gender-Neutral Bathroom Revolution Is Growing.\\" Time. January 11, 2016. Retrieved from Two examples for local or state ordinances regarding unisex public toilets (see also: bathroom bill): * The city council of Portland, Oregon passed an ordinance for \\"all-user restrooms\\" in 2015 which directed city bureaus to convert \\"single-user gender-specific restrooms\\" into \\"all-user restrooms\\" within six months.City of Portland, Resolution Number 37175, December 2015 * On May 11, 2018, the Vermont Gov. Phil Scott signed a bill requiring all single-user public toilets to be unisex, effective July 1, 2018. The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group, recommends that employers grant access, and use, to public toilets according to an employee's \\"full time gender presentation\\", and provides a list of recommendations on achieving this.  History of sex-separated toilets  There are competing theories regarding how and why public toilets (or \\"bathrooms\\" in the United States) first became separated by sex in the United States and Europe. = Western sex-separation as a modern development = Under one theory, offered by Terry Kogan, sex-separation as a standard did not emerge in the U.S. until the late nineteenth century. The theory is that the development was a reflection of women's shift and growth in society, i.e. after women entered the workforce and factories. Massachusetts might have been the first state to pass a law mandating sex-separation in 1887. It was titled \\"An Act To Secure Proper Sanitary Provisions in Factories and Workshops.\\" The law required establishments to have separate toilets in businesses. The act called for suitable and separate toilets for females in the workplace. The first public toilet with provision for women in the UK was Whittington's Longhouse, but some scholars state that usually there was a room for both sexes and that it was not until the Victorian era, starting in Great Britain, that sex separation began in the toilet area. Prior to the modern industrial period, toilets were frequently communal and mixed. It was only in the nineteenth century, with increasingly strict prohibitions on bodily display and the emergence of a rigid ideology of gender, that visual privacy and the spatial separation of the sexes were introduced into public toilet design. It has been claimed that the earliest example of a sex-separated public toilet occurred in Paris (France) in 1739 at a ball. = Western sex-separation as pre-modern = Under another view, offered by W. Burlette Carter, sex-separation has long been the standard in the U.S. and Great Britain and most of the world where women's well-being was valued. She argues that when people used chamber pots, sex-separation could be achieved by placing the pot in a separated space. In single-use privies and similar spaces, that separation was achieved by allowing only one \\"sex\\" to use the space at a time. In multi-use spaces, it was achieved either through the same means or by separate spaces for the sexes. Very likely, the primary reasons for establishing these sex-separated spaces were safety and privacy for women and children. Concerns over undesired pregnancy and procreation were additional considerations. Some of these were related to concerns about rape or about moral views about how and when women should become pregnant (e.g., objections to premarital sex). Evidence also suggest that, in earlier centuries, when people sought to create unisex spaces for those who wanted or needed them, authorities resisted. One scholar claims that toilet separation by sex preceded 1739, and that in fact sex separated toilets have been a feature in multi-use spaces since their beginnings. They argue that, prior to the 1887 Massachusetts statute, across the United States and Europe at least, sex-separation was the norm already. For example, Massachusetts had statewide regulations that required sex-separation in particular venues such as schools before 1887. The earliest written reference to sex-separation in the United States may be from 1786. A traveler described bathers using a public spring called Healing Springs, in South Carolina. The bathers would hang Aprons from a tree to mark when the women were bathing and used Hats to mark when the men were bathing. Within the culture of that time, this practice was tantamount to hanging \\"women\\" and \\"men\\" signs. Furthermore, ancient evidence, including art-work, confirms widespread use of sex- separation (or sex segregation), especially in multi-use spaces - therefore not limiting the concept to public toilets. The exceptions were where the spaces were intended for amorous purposes by opposite sex couples, where safety was considered not to be at risk, or where women were not valued by society. = Primary rationales of sex-separation = One theory argues there were four primary rationales for sex-segregated toilets as detailed by state statutes and related literature in the nineteenth century: sanitation, women's privacy, the protection of women's bodies, which were seen as weaker, and to protect social morality especially as it pertained to the nineteenth century ideology of separate spheres.Massachusetts (State). Legislature. General Court. 1887 Chap. 0183. An Act to Secure Proper Sanitary Provisions in Factories and Workshops. State Library of Massachusetts. http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/handle/2452/83308 Subsequently, other states in the US created similar laws, often by amending existing protective labor legislation. Forty-three states had passed similar legislation by 1920. Others argue that safety and privacy were the two main goals of sex-separation (although factors such as morality also played roles). In New York in 1886, for example, factory inspectors asked for separate toilets out of concerns of women who came to them complaining of sexual harassment. Others argued for complete space separation citing the pressure on women to engage in sexual behavior to keep their jobs. Authorities who cared about these issues were trying to respond to those concerns by mandating separation. Indeed, these laws were likely among the first anti-sexual harassment laws in the nation. Many victims in the workplace were afraid to press charges for fear of losing work. Some scholars have tied toilet sex-separation to segregation based on race discrimination in the US. Advocates of this view argue that these approaches share a theme in which a warning is issued against the looming threats: violence and sexual assaults would increase.Kate Wheeling: Stalled Out: How Social Bias Is Segregating America's Bathrooms - The Pacific Standard\\"Restroom doors and drinking fountains: Perspective, mobility and the fluid grounds of race and gender\\" in: Abel, E. (2010). Signs of the times: the visual politics of Jim Crow. Univ of California Press. Some political activists have drawn on the commonality between public toilets being segregated formerly by race and still by sex. On the other hand, while all discrimination has commonalities, the sex-separation within racial groups, even going back to slavery, suggests that the parallel regarding toilets is historically flawed. For example, slave ships were usually separated by sex. This fact suggests that racial segregation in public toilets and sex separation in them may not be as comparable as some suggest. Moreover, women of color and poor women were often denied the safety and privacy that sex- separation afforded; white women were given these amenities because they were white. This denial was a sign of discrimination against based on race and/or poverty, a sign of society assigning a lesser value to them as women, and not a sign of advancement or enlightenment. Men also experienced different treatment, not based on class, but based on race, with black men having less favorable facilities. There is evidence that when sexual minorities sought to create safe spaces that reimagined sex and gender lines their efforts were resisted. = Controversy = Claims of discrimination being the basis of sex separation may actually harm women because they, if incorrect, erase and contort women's history; they may in fact be presented mainly to provide relief for other vulnerable groups. The same applies to theories that ignore the historical role that sexual harassment and sexual assault have played in women's history. In fact, women's struggles for equality is intricately tied up with efforts to find protection from sexual assault and sexual abuse. The interpretation of public toilet histories that claim patriarchy and sexism primarily drove sex-separation treat women's negative experiences with sexual harassment as if they did not exist. Such approaches pose a conflict of interest between protecting women and achieving the integration of trans women.  Society and culture = Developing countries = In both developed and developing countries, many of the organizations active in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) provision have asserted that separate toilets for boys and girls at school are very important to make girls feel comfortable and safe using the sanitation facilities at schools. For example, in 2018, UNESCO stated that single-sex toilets are needed to overcome girls' barriers to education. This concern could potentially apply to boys as well, especially if open urinals are maintained.UNICEF (2012). Raising even more clean hands - Advancing health, learning and equity through WASH in schools. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), New York, USAHouse, S. et al., 2014. Violence, gender & WASH: A practitioner‚Äôs toolkit- Making water, sanitation and hygiene safer through improved programming and services. Available at: http://violencewash.lboro.ac.uk/ As an alternative, some argue that unisex school toilets could be provided at schools in addition to facilities that are separated by gender (which is often the case already in the case of toilets for people with disabilities). WaterAid is researching options of appropriate unisex public toilets in developing countries. In 2017 they stated that those kinds of gender-neutral/mixed-sex toilets, where people can access all toilets irrespective of their gender, is not recommended in contexts where it may increase the risk of violence against women or transgender people, or where it is deemed culturally inappropriate. Many women, especially those who have been victims of sexual abuse in the past, have asserted the right to continue using all-female toilets to minimize the risk of any kind of sexual harassment in public toilets. Some activists favor 'third gender' public toilets which would only be used by transgender people. The degree of agreement or disagreement on such issues is difficult to gauge. However, this is still being debated. Some advocates argue that it would reinforce stigma and result in people being banned from accessing the toilets of the gender they identify with.Benjamin, C, Hueso, A. (2017) LGBTI and sanitation: what we know and what the gaps are. 40th WEDC International Conference, Loughborough, UK, 2017 It has been argued that in some African countries where transgender people are being prosecuted, this option would likely bring no benefit at all to them. In the case of India, it has been found that designing transgender-inclusive sanitation is more than just a technical issue: It requires a deeper examination of the role of caste, gender, and age within the transgender community. Using a toilet that explicitly broadcasts a transgender person's identity to others may not be desirable to all transgender persons. =Gender nonconforming people= Some toilets use a combined gender symbol to indicate a unisex, gender-neutral or transgender-friendly public toilet Advocates in 2013 say that all-gender public toilets are designed to ensure that toilets are fully accessible to all members of society. They argue that unisex public toilets can eliminate discrimination and harassment for people who may be perceived to be in the \\"wrong\\" toilet. Advocates argue that public toilets and sanitation facilities have historically not met the needs of the LGBTI communities. They argue that this is an issue with respect to the human right to water and sanitation and also from the perspective of the Sustainable Development Goal 6, which aim for universal access to sanitation and their vision of gender equality. Advocates argue that those outside the gender binary face harassment and threat of physical violence without access to gender neutral bathrooms. Many hate crimes have taken place following transgender people using a bathroom which others consider incorrect. Alexa Negr√≥n Luciano of Puerto Rico was shot and killed just hours after being reported to police for using a women's bathroom. Hate speech and gun shots can be heard in a video of the killing, causing investigators to treat this incident as motivated by transphobia. Sex- separation of public toilets began gaining traction as a controversial issue for transgender identity in US politics in 2010. It has been argued that walking into a toilet separated by sex requires people to self-separate and that some transgender people report being challenged on what public toilet they choose to use and subsequently \\"do their best to forego use of public toilets altogether\\". In the early twenty-first century, with increased coverage of the transgender community, there have been some initiatives calling for unisex public toilets, instead of only male and female ones, to better accommodate genderqueer individuals.Toilet: Public Restrooms and the Politics of Sharing - Page 192, Laura Noren - 2010 This has become an increasingly contentious issue, as shown in the battles over North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act 2016. Transgender and gender non- conforming persons also may be subject to embarrassment, harassment, or even assault or arrest by others offended by the presence of a person they interpret as being of a different anatomical sex to themselves. Several groups and organizations, whether in person or online, exist in order to combat attitudes and bills that oppose transgender individuals. For instance, the Transgender Law Center's \\"Peeing in Peace\\" is a pamphlet that serves as a resource guide full of information on harassment, safe public toilet campaigns and legal information. =Criticism = Some opponents of unisex public toilets argue that eliminating sex-separation entirely or identifying unisex spaces as the norm is not inclusive and that the approach excludes women. Opponents of unisex public toilets have often referenced concerns that women and children are more likely to be harassed and sexually assaulted there compared to sex-segregated public toilets. Safety in public toilets remains a serious issue for women. The recording of people in private spaces without their consent (such as installing spy cams) is also an issue. Other concerns include that unisex toilets are avoided by women, leading to both discomfort to women and wasting funds. Supporters of single-sex toilets point to the specific needs of women, such as menstrual hygiene, and argue that these require sex-segregation in public toilets, for reasons of personal comfort and privacy, and that this is especially true for teenage girls. Some women's groups (including some feminist and lesbian groups), have opposed making unisex toilets the norm, based on safety concerns for most women and a need for safe spaces. In the UK, groups like WomansPlaceUK have led a charge to secure \\"safe\\" spaces for women, arguing that sexual harassment dangers would be increased for women. They assert that they affirm the existence of transgender people and their right to protection but that women's rights, as they see them, must also be recognized. In this respect, debate has centered around UK proposals to amend the Gender Recognition Act to allow self- identification even for entry into spaces designated for women. Supporters of unisex spaces and access by self-declaration have rejected these claims.Cavanagh, S. L. (2010). Queering bathrooms: Gender, sexuality, and the hygienic imagination. University of Toronto Press. A publication in 2018 argued that the scholarship on the history of sex-separation is flawed and places too much emphasis on the negative sides of sex separation in public toilets for women, ignoring aspects of safety for women from sexual harassment. These false narratives should be corrected and there is also a need for more innovative solutions. Supporters of sex-segregated toilets argue that unisex toilets can make women feel uncomfortable, and that both males and females may feel \\"awkward\\" having to share a toilet with the opposite sex. Transgender advocates have focused attention on rebutting whether transgender people will attack women. They also focus on the experience of transgender people. By one report, 70% of transgender people report facing harassment or assault while trying to use a public toilet in the District of Columbia. Some religious groups have opposed unisex public toilets arguing safety and also morality. In 2017, a conservative Christian faith group leader in Texas has compared the introduction of unisex toilets with the abolition of Bible reading in state schools.Transgender 'bathroom bill' leaves Texas Christians deeply divided - The Guardian In Texas there is energy for and against new bathroom bills by various groups of Christians. In Germany, a member of the German right-wing party Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) regards the unisex toilet as a danger for German women and relates it to sexual assaults by \\"criminal foreigners\\".Eine Toilette f√ºr alle Geschlechter ‚Äì wo ist da eigentlich das Problem? - Stern = Protests and opposition = Backlash has sometimes occurred when unisex public toilets have been implemented without wide public embrace. After backlash, and complaints primarily from women, the Barbican Centre in the UK was required to reconsider its original design, which planned gender-neutral toilets. They later issued a statement promising they would keep sex separated toilets as well. In Los Angeles in 2016 there were violent clashes between supporters and opponents of toilets.\\"Students, protesters fight outside LA school with gender-neutral bathroom\\" In: abc7.com In Germany, the newly installed unisex toilets at Bielefeld University have repeatedly been vandalized.T√§ter zerst√∂ren wiederholt Unisex-Toiletten- Immer wieder wird \\"All Gender\\"-Toilette an Uni Bielefeld besch√§digt - Tag24 In the UK, the advocacy group Resisters plastered stickers all over the UK to protest what they called the confiscation of women's spaces. The stickers were in the shape of a penis and stated, \\"Women Don't Have Penises.\\" A number of local women's groups referred to the behavior as insulting to transgender persons and hate speech. An event hosted by the advocacy group A Woman's Place UK to discuss and protest changes in the UK's Gender Recognition Act to allow self identification faced a bomb threat in June 2018. They believe such changes would result in women and girls' being denied what they call \\"safe spaces\\" and increase women and girls' susceptibility to harassment and violence. Women's Place UK has accused opponents, including those within the UK Labour party of trying to silence women who speak out.

It is a dark blue solid. Vanadium(IV) dioxide is amphoteric, dissolving in non-oxidising acids to give the blue vanadyl ion, [VO]2+ and in alkali to give the brown [V4O9]2‚àí ion, or at high pH [VO4]4‚àí. VO2 has a phase transition very close to room temperature (~66 ¬∞C). Electrical resistivity, opacity, etc, can change up several orders. Owing to these properties, it has been used in surface coating, sensors, and imaging. Potential applications include use in memory devices, phase-change switches, aerospace communication systems and neuromorphic computing. Properties = Structure = structure. Vanadium atoms are purple and oxygen atoms are pink. The V‚ÄìV dimers are highlighted by violet lines in (a). The distances between adjacent vanadium atoms are equal in (b). At temperatures below Tc = 340 K (67 ¬∞C), has a monoclinic (space group P21/c) crystal structure. Above Tc, the structure is tetragonal, like rutile . In the monoclinic phase, the V4+ ions form pairs along the c axis, leading to alternate short and long V-V distances of 2.65 √Ö and 3.12 √Ö. In comparison, in the rutile phase the V4+ ions are separated by a fixed distance of 2.96 √Ö. As a result, the number of V4+ ions in the crystallographic unit cell doubles from the rutile to the monoclinic phase. The equilibrium morphology of rutile particles is acicular, laterally confined by (110) surfaces, which are the most stable termination planes. The surface tends to be oxidized with respect to the stoichiometric composition, with the oxygen adsorbed on the (110) surface forming vanadyl species. The presence of V5+ ions at the surface of films has been confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. = Electronic = At the rutile to monoclinic transition temperature (67 ¬∞C), also exhibits a metal to semiconductor transition in its electronic structure: the rutile phase is metallic while the monoclinic phase is semiconducting. The optical band gap of VO2 in the low-temperature monoclinic phase is about 0.7 eV. = Thermal = Metallic VO2 contradicts the Wiedemann‚ÄìFranz law that holds that the ratio of the electronic contribution of the thermal conductivity (Œ∫) to the electrical conductivity (œÉ) of a metal is proportional to the temperature. The thermal conductivity that could be attributed to electron movement was 10% of the amount predicted by the Wiedemann‚ÄìFranz law. The reason for this appears to be the fluidic way that the electrons move through the material, reducing the typical random electron motion. Thermal conductivity ~ 0.2 W/m‚ãÖK, electrical conductivity ~ 8.0 √ó10^5 S/m. Potential applications include converting waste heat from engines and appliances into electricity, or window coverings that keep buildings cool. Thermal conductivity varied when VO2 was mixed with other materials. At a low temperature it could act as an insulator, while conducting heat at a higher temperature. Synthesis and structure Nanostars of vanadium(IV) oxide Following the method described by Berzelius, is prepared by comproportionation of vanadium(III) oxide and vanadium(V) oxide:Brauer, G. ed. (1963) Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Academic Press. NY. Vol. 1. p. 1267. : + ‚Üí 4 At room temperature VO2 has a distorted rutile structure with shorter distances between pairs of V atoms indicating metal-metal bonding. Above 68 ¬∞C the structure changes to an undistorted rutile structure and the metal-metal bonds are broken causing an increase in electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility as the bonding electrons are \\"released\\". The origin of this insulator to metal transition remains controversial and is of interest both for condensed matter physicsNew studies explain insulator-to-metal transition of vanadium dioxide, PhysOrg. April 11, 2015. and practical applications, such as electrical switches, tunable electrical filters, power limiters, nano- oscillators, memristors, field-effect transistors and metamaterials. Infrared reflectance Transmittance spectra of a / film. Mild heating results in significant absorption of infrared light expresses temperature- dependent reflective properties. When heated from room temperature to 80 ¬∞C, the material's thermal radiation rises normally until 74 ¬∞C, before suddenly appearing to drop to around 20 ¬∞C. At room temperature is almost transparent to infrared light. As its temperature rises it gradually changes to reflective. At intermediate temperatures it behaves as a highly absorbing dielectric. A thin film of vanadium oxide on a highly reflecting substrate (for specific infrared wavelengths) such as sapphire is either absorbing or reflecting, dependent on temperature. Its emissivity varies considerably with temperature. When the vanadium oxide transitions with increased temperature, the structure undergoes a sudden decrease in emissivity ‚Äì looking colder to infrared cameras than it really is. Varying the substrate materials e.g., to indium tin oxide, and modifying the vanadium oxide coating using doping, straining and other processes, alter the wavelengths and temperature ranges at which the thermal effects are observed. Nanoscale structures that appear naturally in the materials' transition region can suppress thermal radiation as the temperature rises. Doping the coating with tungsten lowers the effect's thermal range to room temperature. Uses =Infrared radiation management= Undoped and tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide films can act as \\"spectrally-selective\\" coatings to block infrared transmission and reduce the loss of building interior heat through windows.Guzman, G. Vanadium dioxide as infrared active coating. solgel.com Varying the amount of tungsten allows regulating the phase transition temperature at a rate of 20 ¬∞C per 1 atomic percent of tungsten. The coating has a slight yellow-green color. Other potential applications of its thermal properties include passive camouflage, thermal beacons, communication, or to deliberately speed up or slow down cooling (which could be useful in a variety of structures from homes to satellites). Vanadium dioxide can act as extremely fast optical modulators, infrared modulators for missile guidance systems, cameras, data storage, and other applications. The thermochromic phase transition between the transparent semiconductive and reflective conductive phase, occurring at 68 ¬∞C, can happen in times as short as 100 femtoseconds. =Phase change computing and memory= The insulator-metal phase transition in VO2 can be manipulated at the nanoscale using a biased conducting atomic force microscope tip, suggesting applications in computing and information storage.

It encompasses a sprawling forested area featuring many lakes and streams. These include Belliveau Lake, Victor Lake, Spectacle Lake, Lac D'en Bas, and the Meteghan River. Its inhabitants are mostly situated on the axis of the Patrice and Second Division Roads and along the lake shores. History The first Acadian settlers arrived in Concession in 1818. The Second Division Road was noted in historical documents by 1830. The first wave of Acadians in Clare settled along the shores of St. Mary's Bay from present-day St. Bernard to Little Brook upon tracts of land known as the \\"Bastarache Concession\\" granted to them by the British in May 1775. In January 1801, other tracts were granted, the \\"Deuxi√®me Concession\\" (the Second Division), and the \\"Troisi√®me Concession\\" (the Third Division) lying between the first grants along St. Mary's Bay and the New Tusket settlements deeper inland. The village was simply referred to as \\"les concessions\\" and retains that name to this day. Concession enjoyed railway service from 1879 to 1990. It is now the site of exit 29 of Highway 101. The village was originally served by its own post office beginning in 1886. It is now Rural Route #1 served by the Church Point post office, postal code B0W 1M0. Concession had its own elementary school from the 1920s to the mid-1970s when the local schools were consolidated. The building was converted into a window and woodworking factory. Electrical and telephone utilities became available here in the late 1950s. For many years the inhabitants engaged in agriculture and timbering (lumber, firewood), lumber was sawn at various mills in the village and conveyed to markets via the St. Mary's Bay shores or by railroad. The late 1950s saw the establishment of several large hog farms in Concession which operated until 2007 when low commodity prices and high overhead costs forced their closures. The most prominent structure in the village is the Notre Dame du Mont Carmel Roman Catholic Church. Built in 1902 on the hill near the intersection of the Patrice and Second Division Roads, it is a landmark that can be seen for miles around. Victor Lake in Concession is home to the Camp Jeunesse Acadienne (CJA), a youth summer camp that was at one time ran by nuns; however, it is now staffed by summer students sponsored by government summer jobs programs. The CJA is also the starting point for the extremely popular annual Clare Canoe Trip every Easter weekend. The canoes travel the Meteghan and Salmon River systems in the heightened springtime melt waters. At a nearby home stands the largest Horse Chestnut tree in Nova Scotia. It is 136 centimetres (54 in) in diameter and 17 metres (66 ft) tall. Concession's Lac D'en Bas has the dubious distinction of being the first site of the illegal introduction of the invasive chain pickerel fish species by an overzealous sports fisherman. This voracious predator has decimated native fish stocks here and in other lakes and watersheds of southern Nova Scotia where it has been subsequently introduced. A large Catholic cemetery, Notre Dame Du Mont Carmel/Our Lady of Mount Carmel, is located in the community of Concession. A genealogical index project, completed in 2013, indicates over 850 burials in the cemetery.

Hydrated forms, also rare, include hexahydrate (stanleyite), pentahydrates (minasragrite, orthominasragrite, and anorthominasragrite) and trihydrate - bobjonesite. Medical research Vanadyl sulfate is a component of food supplements and experimental drugs. Vanadyl sulfate exhibits insulin-like effects. Vanadyl sulfate has been extensively studied in the field of diabetes research as a potential means of increasing insulin sensitivity. No evidence indicates that oral vanadium supplementation improves glycaemic control. Treatment with vanadium often results in gastrointestinal side-effects, primarily diarrhea. Vanadyl sulfate is also marketed as a health supplement, often for bodybuilding. Deficiencies in vanadium result in reduced growth in rats. Its effectiveness for bodybuilding has not been proven; some evidence suggests that athletes who take it are merely experiencing a placebo effect.

This forced the closing of beaches on the Atlantic coast. Officials scrambled to identify the source of the material as some local economies struggled with diminished tourism. Reaction Reports of medical waste and sewage spills drove away hundreds of thousands of vacationers, costing the $7.7-billion-a-year tourism industry on the Jersey Shore more than $1 billion in lost revenue that summer, tourism officials say. Later the losses were tallied between 15 and 40% of typical tourism revenue. It was a source of even greater turmoil due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. Sources and reaction Officials finally traced the source of the waste to the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island. After much deliberation, New York City was required to pay $1 million for past pollution damages as well as pay for the cleanup. No reparations were paid to the business owners on the Jersey Shore for revenues lost during the months of inactivity. In response to syringe tides of 1987 and 1988, the participants in the New Jersey Harbor Estuary Program (HEP)New York-New jersey Harbor Estuary Plan , accessed February 19, 2007 implemented an extremely successful effort, known as the Short-term Floatables Action Plan. The plan has been implemented since 1989 and is supposed to curtail floatable debris wash-ups by intercepting debris slicks within the Harbor. With this plan, the extent of beach closures declined from over in 1988 to fewer than in 1989, and closures have remained at a low level in later years. The Short-term Floatables Action Plan has four key elements:Floatable Debris, accessed February 19, 2007 *Surveillance: Environmental organizations will conduct regular air and sea patrols of the Harbor to look for and report slicks of floatable debris. *Regular Cleanups: The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) will use cleanup vessels to collect floatable debris in the Harbor and focuses its activities on conditions when slicks are most likely to occur. *Non-routine Cleanups: USACE also attempts to capture additional debris slicks in the Harbor when they are detected and reported. *Communications Network: United States Environmental Protection Agency coordinates a reporting network as well as cleanup activities among all the program participants. Popular culture The Syringe Tide is referenced in Billy Joel's 1989 hit single \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\" by the line \\"Hypodermics on the shores.\\" In The Simpsons episode \\"The Old Man and the 'C' Student\\", when punishing the students Principal Skinner sends Milhouse to the beach to \\"pick up all this medical waste that's washed up on the shore.\\" Milhouse accidentally pricks himself on a syringe, and Skinner replies \\"Well, just keep working. You'll prick yourself with the antidote sooner or later.\\" The 1988 Skinny Puppy song \\"Hospital Waste\\" was written about the incident. In the episode \\"The Gang Goes to the Jersey Shore\\" from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, Frank and Mac are on a beach covered in needles but blame it on New Jersey being the steroid capital of the world.

It has greyish brown fur and white ear tufts, and has a head-body length of around one and a half feet, or forty to fifty centimeters. They have relatively long tails and long back legs for leaping vertically amongst the trees of their forest habitat. It feeds almost exclusively on the bamboo species of Cathariostachys madagascariensis, preferring the shoots but also eating the pith and leaves. It is unknown how their metabolism deals with the cyanide found in the shoots. The typical daily dose would be enough to kill humans. Greater bamboo lemurs occasionally consume fungi, flowers, and fruit. Its main food source is bamboo and it is the main reason why it has become critically endangered. Areas with high density of bamboo have major human disturbances, where humans cut or illegally cut down bamboo. Its only confirmed predators are the fossa and the bushpigs, but raptors are also suspected. Its current range is restricted to southeastern Madagascar, although fossils indicate its former range extended across bigger areas of the island, including as far north as Ankarana. Some notable parts of the current range are the Ranomafana and Andringitra National Parks. Greater bamboo lemurs live in groups of up to 28. Individuals are extremely gregarious. The species may be the only lemur in which the male is dominant, although this is not certain. Because of their social nature, greater bamboo lemurs have at least seven different calls. Males have been observed taking bamboo pith away from females that had put significant effort into opening the bamboo stems. In captivity, greater bamboo lemurs have lived over the age of 17. Greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) male 2.jpg Greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) male eating 1.jpg Greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) male eating 2.jpg Prolemur simus Cedric Girard-Buttoz.jpg  Conservation status  The greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus), is one of the world's most critically endangered primates, according to the IUCN Red List. Scientists believed that it was extinct, but a remnant population was discovered in 1986. Since then, surveys of south- and central-eastern Madagascar have found about 500 individuals in 11 subpopulations. The home range of the species is likewise drastically reduced. The current range is less than 4 percent of its historic distribution. The reason for the endangerment is climate change and human activities which depleted the primary food source (bamboo). Greater bamboo lemur is a part of prosimian species, which appeared even before monkeys. This species of lemur is not capable of adapting to the rapidly changing habitat. Human activities and climate change have resulted in the depletion of populations and resulted in a few remaining patches of forest capable of supporting this species. The species is endangered by the following: slash and burn farming, mining, bamboo, and other logging, and slingshot hunting.

She was one of four destroyers ordered in 1918 from Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson, Wallsend-on-Tyne under the 14th Order for Destroyers of the Emergency War Program of 1917‚Äì18. She was the second Royal Navy ship to carry the name, after the sloop in 1876. Like her sisters, she was completed too late to see action in the First World War. Construction and design Wild Swan was one of seven Modified W-class destroyers that were completed after World War I, out of an original order for 38 ships issued in April 1918.Friedman 2009, pp. 170, 313‚Äì314. She was built by Swan Hunter at Wallsend on Tyne, being laid down in July 1918, launched on 17 May 1919 and completed on 14 November 1919.Preston 1971, pp. 109‚Äì110. Wild Swan was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of between and depending on load. Displacement was standard and deep load.Preston 1971, pp. 102, 110. Three oil-fed Yarrow boilers raising steam at fed Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines which developed , driving two screws for a maximum designed speed of . The ship carried of oil giving a range of at .Preston 1971, pp. 108, 110. She shipped four 4.7 in (120 mm) BL guns on four single center-line mounts. These were disposed as two forward and two aft in super imposed firing positions. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of two 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" autocannon. Six 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mounts on the center-line. She had a crew of 134 officers and other ranks. Pre-war service On commissioning, the ship joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, based at Port Edgar on the Firth of Forth and from March to July 1920, operated in the Baltic.Smith 1985, p. 236. She remained with the 3rd Flotilla when the Royal Navy's Destroyer Flotillas were reorganised from large flotillas of 16 destroyers and a leader to smaller units of eight ships and a leader in 1921.Preston 1971, pp. 35‚Äì36. The 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, including Wild Swan, transferred from the Atlantic Fleet to the Mediterranean Fleet in September 1922 as a result of the Chanak Crisis, a war scare between Britain and Turkey towards the end of the Greco-Turkish War. The 3rd Flotilla assisted in the evacuation of Greeks from Turkish territory after the end of the year, escorting transports carrying Greek troops.Preston 1971, p. 49. On 24‚Äì25 December 1923, she took part in the unsuccessful hunt for the French airship Dixmunde, searching the Gulf of Gab√®s,English 2019, p. 122. although Dixmunde had in fact been destroyed in an explosion off Sicily on 21 December.Robinson 1975, pp. 347‚Äì349. Wild Swan had her boilers retubed at Sheerness dockyard in June‚ÄìJuly 1926. As a result of the outbreak of the Chinese Civil War the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla was despatched from the Mediterranean to China in order to protect British interests, arriving at Hong Kong on 15 October 1926.Preston 1971, p. 54.The Naval Review February 1930, pp. 97‚Äì99. Wild Swan was based at Jiujiang on the Yangtze river from January to June 1927, and on 26 March Wild Swan and the river gunboat intercepted the British steamer Kiangwo which had been seized by Chinese Nationalist troops to ferry troops up the Yangtze. After negotiation, the Nationalists released the vessel, paying compensation to the ship's owners.The Naval Review February 1930, pp. 105‚Äì106. The Flotilla re-assembled at Hong Kong on 1 May 1928 to prepare to return to home waters, but departure was delayed by the Jinan incident, a clash between Chinese Nationalist and Japanese troops, with the Flotilla not leaving until 8 July.The Naval Review February 1930, p. 116. The 3rd Flotilla was re-equipped with A-class destroyers in 1930, and Wild Swan was placed in reserve.Manning 1961, p. 28. She was re-commissioned in 1931, joining the 8th Destroyer Flotilla on the China Station. Wild Swan transferred to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla based at Singapore in December 1934.Smith 1985, p. 237. The flotilla transferred to the Mediterranean during the Abyssinian crisis.Manning 1961, p. 29. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 saw Wild Swan at Gibraltar and on 23 July she was patrolling in the Straits of Gibraltar when she was near missed by bombs dropped by Nationalist bombers, which resulted in Wild Swan firing back at the aircraft.Alberca 2015, pp. 49‚Äì50. Between 25 and 28 July she took part in the evacuation of civilians from Huelva, and then returned to the United Kingdom, reaching Spithead on 31 July. Wild Swan then joined the Local Defence Flotilla at Portsmouth, taking part in the Coronation Fleet Review for King George VI on 20 May 1937. On 23 August 1937, Wild Swan was paid off into reserve, and remained in reserve at Portsmouth into 1939. She underwent a long refit at Chatham in late 1939 to update her equipment, including the fitting of anti-submarine detection equipment (ASDIC). This refit and consequent trials did not complete until December 1939. Second World War =Early operations= After her refit, Wild Swan was allocated to the 18th Destroyer Flotilla; however, in January 1940 she participated in trials on degaussing equipment, attached to the torpedo school, .Smith 1985, pp. 23‚Äì24. On 25 February 1940, Wild Swan joined the 18th Flotilla and commenced operations.Smith 1985, p. 26. On 4 March, Wild Swan and sister ship were dispatched from Plymouth to join the sloop in the search for a German U-boat that a merchant ship had reported sighting west of the Scilly Isles. Leith attacked a possible contact on that day, with Wild Swan joining in in the attacks on 5 March. Although depth charges brought up an oil slick, it was concluded that the contact was a false alarm, and the ships had been attacking a pre-existing wreck.Smith 1985, pp. 28‚Äì29. On 11 March, the German submarine torpedoed the Dutch tanker and Wild Swan, and the leader were sent to investigate. Wild Swan rescued Eulotas crew before Broke scuttled the remains of the tanker.Smith 1985, p. 30. Wild Swan continued with convoy escort duties and investigating reports of U-boats through the rest of March and into April 1940.Smith 1985, pp. 31‚Äì32. =Holland, Boulogne and Dunkirk= On 18 April, Wild Swan transferred to the 19th Destroyer Flotilla based at Dover.Smith 1985, p. 33. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Part of Britain's response was \\"Operation XD\\", with four destroyers (Wild Swan, , and ) embarking demolition teams in order to destroy key facilities at Dutch ports before they could be captured by the Germans. Wild Swan was tasked with landing its party at the Hook of Holland, arriving there on the afternoon of 10 May. She shelled German paratroops in a wood to the east of Hook of Holland on 11 May. She received damage to her starboard propeller while alongside at the Hook of Holland, and on 12 May was near missed by bombs from a German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber which damaged the ship's condensers, before rescuing survivors from the passenger ship , which had been sunk by German dive bombers.Smith 1985, pp. 34‚Äì36, 46, 49‚Äì52. Wild Swan returned to Dover on 13 May, and went into dock to repair her damaged propeller and condensers.Smith 1985, pp. 55‚Äì56. On 21 May, Wild Swan was ordered to Boulogne, threatened by advancing German troops, picking up 150 British civilians and ferrying them back to Dover.Smith 1985, pp. 58‚Äì59.Winser 1999, p. 11. On 22 May she crossed the Channel to Dunkirk to carry out escort operations, but was diverted to Boulogne to carry out shore bombardment operations against advancing German troops along with the British destroyers and and the French destroyers , , , , , , , and . They were attacked by German bombers, and Wild Swan was near missed by a German bomb, with splinters killing three men and seriously wounding another.Smith 1985, p. 61‚Äì63.Rohwer and H√ºmmelchen 1992, p. 20. On 23 May, Wild Swan took a demolition party to Dunkirk, and returned to Dover that afternoon with 155 military and civilians rescued from Dunkirk.Smith 1985, pp. 63‚Äì64. She then returned to Boulogne, where the situation had deteriorated severely, in order to take place in an evacuation of as many British troops as possible. Wild Swan entered Boulogne harbour at 20:25 hrs, shortly after and had left and was followed in by the destroyers and . As Venetia entered the harbour, she was shelled heavily by a German-manned shore battery and German tanks in an attempt to sink the ship in the entrance to the harbour and trap the remaining two ships. While Venetia was hit seven times, Venomous and Wild Swan managed to return fire with their 4.7 inch guns, suppressing the German shelling, so that Venetia could escape while Wild Swan and Venomous embarked troops (403 aboard Wild Swan and 500 aboard Venomous) before the two ships rejoined Venetia and returned to Dover.Smith 1985, pp. 65‚Äì72.Sebag-Montefiore 2015, pp. 208‚Äì209, 593‚Äì594.Winser 1999, p. 12. On 26 May Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the BEF from Dunkirk started. Wild Swan escorted the ferry Maid of Orleans, carrying drinking water for the trapped troops and the transport Canterbury to Dunkirk on 26 May, picking up General Ralph Eastwood and his staff before returning to Dover. She was then ordered to Portsmouth for a short refit, where her boilers were cleaned and the aft set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a 12-pounder (i.e. 3-inch (76-mm)) anti-aircraft gun, and two extra depth charge throwers fitted.Smith 1985, pp. 79‚Äì80. =Channel and North Sea operations= RFA War Nawab, one of the old tankers to be used as Fire ships as part of Operation Lucid After the refit, on 8 June, Wild Swan rejoined the 19th Destroyer Flotilla.Smith 1985, p. 80. On 17 June, Wild Swan landed a demolition party at St Malo, calling in at Jersey on the way there, where she requisitioned seven small merchant ships to take place in the evacuation of troops from St Malo, part of Operation Cycle.Winser 1999, pp. 44, 46. The 19th Flotilla was then based at Harwich, escorting convoys in the North Sea, and carrying out anti-invasion patrols, together with offensive strikes against enemy shipping.Smith 1985, p. 86. On 30 July, Wild Swan was carrying out an anti-invasion patrol with Whitshed and when Whitshed struck a mine. Wild Swan towed Whitshed stern first back to Harwich.Smith 1985, p. 92. On the night of 10/11 September, Wild Swan, and carried out an offensive sweep off the Belgian coast, attacking several barges and trawlers that were being used as escorts, sinking at least one of the barges and two trawlers.Smith 1985, pp. 98‚Äì101. On the night of 13/14 September Wild Swan and Venomous again struck against German coastal shipping off Boulogne, engaging several German trawlers, before breaking off the engagement when coming under fire from German coastal artillery. On 16 September, Wild Swan collided with the destroyer , sustaining minor damage to the ship's bow.Smith 1985, p. 103. Later in September, Wild Swan was allocated to Operation Lucid, a plan to convert old oil tankers as Fire ships and use them to attack invasion barges in French ports. Wild Swan was part of the escort force on the first attempt to carry out Lucid, on the night of 25/26 September, where and were to be sacrificed, but this was abandoned because of unsuitable weather conditions and the poor condition of the fire ships. A second attempt on 2 October was cancelled due to poor weather. A third attempt was made on the night of 4/5 October, with War Nizam and Mytilus being sent against Calais and Oakfield against Boulogne. Wild Swan again formed part of the escort covering force, but unsuitable weather conditions again caused cancellation.Smith 1985, pp. 104‚Äì107. =Atlantic escort= On 30 October, Wild Swan was transferred to the 7th Escort Group based at Liverpool. One early escort mission with the 7th Escort Group was Convoy HX83, which Wild Swan joined on 4 November. On the night of 4/5 November, the German U-boat , commanded by Otto Kretschmer, fresh from sinking the Armed Merchant Cruisers and , attacked the convoy, firing torpedoes from outside the convoy, with the torpedoes passing between Wild Swan and the destroyer , patrolling on the East side of the Convoy, and sinking the tanker . Neither Wild Swan or Beagle spotted U-99, and despite seeing an explosion, did not realise that the attack had come from their side of the convoy. The crews of Wild Swan and Beagle, both new to North Atlantic convoy operations, were criticised for keeping a poor lookout.Blair 2000, pp. 208‚Äì209.Smith 1985, pp. 112, 114. On 23 December, Wild Swan was departing Liverpool in company with the destroyer when Warwick set off an acoustic mine, and was badly damaged, with the engine room flooded and the ship settling low in the water. Wild Swan towed Warwick back to Liverpool, allowing the damaged ship to be repaired.Smith 1985, pp. 122‚Äì123. On 9 January Wild Swan was detached from Convoy OB270 to search for the survivors of the cargo ship which had been sunk by a German Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor long-range bomber the previous day. Wild Swan and the Armed Merchant Cruiser rescued the survivors later that same day. Despite being short of fuel, Wild Swan was then ordered to search for the steamer , which had been torpedoed and sunk by , with Wild Swan and Esperance Bay rescuing Bassanos survivors.Smith 1985, pp. 125‚Äì130. On 29 January, Wild Swan was returning to Liverpool when she encountered the steamer , which had struck a mine earlier that day and had been abandoned by her crew. The steamer remained afloat, and Wild Swan recovered Westmorelands crew, put them back aboard the steamer and assisted in the recovery of the stricken vessel, with Wild Swans crew later being awarded ¬£600 for taking part in the salvage of the ship.Smith 1985, pp. 131‚Äì132. Wild Swan continued escort operations in the North Atlantic until March 1941, when she underwent a much- needed refit at the Royal Albert Dock in London. The ship's machinery was overhauled extensively, and Type 286 surface search radar fitted. The dockyard was heavily bombed on 19 April and Wild Swan was slightly damaged by German bombs, with near misses causing leaking oil tanksSmith 1985, pp. 134‚Äì138. =Africa and Gibraltar= After completing her refit on 26 April, Wild Swan joined the 1st Destroyer Flotilla based at Portsmouth. A shortage of escorts off West Africa resulted in Wild Swan being ordered to transfer to Freetown, Sierra Leone. Before she was due to sail for Africa, the sinking of the British battlecruiser by the in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, resulted in Wild Swan, together with and being ordered to stand by at Plymouth, ready to be sent to intercept the German Battleship or to escort the battleships and (there was a chance that fuel shortages could force the Battleships' destroyer escort to turn back, leaving them unprotected against submarine attack). Bismarck was sunk on the night of 26/27 May without the need for the three elderly destroyers to intervene, but late on 27 May, the three destroyers were instead ordered to go to the aid of the Ocean boarding vessel , which had been set on fire by German bombers off Cape Cornwall, near Land's End. Wild Swan picked up twenty survivors from Registan, although four of them died.Smith 1985, pp. 141‚Äì144. The three destroyers joined the escort to the Cape-bound convoy WS-8X on 1 June 1941, being detached from the convoy on 3 June and reaching Gibraltar on 6 June.Smith 1985, p. 145. The three destroyers took part in escort duties during the rendezvous of the aircraft carriers and prior to Operation Tracer, but Wild Swan returned to Gibraltar on 10 June. The three destroyers set out for West Africa on 13 June, sailing for Freetown via Bathurst, and arriving at Freetown on 18 June.Smith 1985, pp. 145‚Äì146. Wild Swan carried out escort operations from Freetown through the rest of June and July, but by then the pressure off West Africa had reduced, and Wild Swan was ordered to Gibraltar, reaching there on 10 August.Smith 1985, p. 150. The ship soon began a regular pattern of escorting the Gibraltar to Britain HG convoys as far as fuel would last, this beginning with Convoy HG.70, where the strong escort managed to repel a series of attacks by enemy submarines, so that the only loss was one freighter sunk by bombing.Smith 1985, pp. 150‚Äì151.Blair 2000, pp. 336‚Äì337. Loss On 16 June 1942, Wild Swan was in the Western Approaches as part of the escort for convoy HG84. She was detached for refuelling, and happened to be passing through a group of Spanish trawlers, when a squadron of 12 German Junkers Ju 88 bombers mistook these vessels as the convoy and attacked them. Wild Swan replied vigorously, claiming six German aircraft destroyed. She was, however, already seriously damaged by four near-misses, she lost steering control and collided with one of the Spanish trawlers, which sank almost immediately. She rescued 11 survivors from the trawler, but Wild Swan also sank (at ). The British reported that three of the trawlers were also sunk by bombs.Hammerton, John Alexander (1942). The War illustrated. Volume 6, Issues 131-155. The Amalgamated Press, p. 92 The survivors of both vessels were subsequently rescued after fifteen hours in open boats, but 31 British seamen died through exposure. According to a Ministry of Defence historical document: 17 June 1942 \\"Picked up 10 officers and 123 ratings, five of whom seriously injured, from Wild Swan, (sunk after damaged by air attack and collision with Spanish trawler in Bay of Biscay) and 11 men from Spanish trawler.\\" The survivors were landed at Milford Haven. The Wild Swan's commander, Claude Sclater, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for the action.

Xavier Basil Radoff (Charles Radoff) was born on March 15, 1894 in Izmail, Bessarabia, Russia (present-day Ukraine). Born to Basil Radoff and Marta Eudokia-Radoff. He was the second son and had three sisters. His family was poor and all the family finances went toward the eldest son‚Äôs education. His father died when he was very young. His mother remarried but he was never close with his stepfather. The area he grew up in was diverse in its peoples and cultures. Radoff attained a second grade education only. He then had to start working to help support the family. He was raised in the Russian Orthodox Church. At an early age, he witnessed his mother from time to time hiding Jewish families in their cellar to save them from relocation by soldiers. At the age of 18, Radoff emigrated to the United States arriving at Ellis Island December 5, 1912. The government workers at Ellis Island gave him the anglsied name \\"Charles\\" which he used the rest of his life. Radoff lived in New York City working any job he could find. He eventually found employment at a posh club for the rich as a member of the wait staff. Here he was taught tennis and learned to play rather well. He would sketch in pencil some of the sights in New York. These drawings are lost. Radoff served in the United States Army Cavalry during World War I. The U.S. Army Air Service#Air Service of the AEF became aware of Radoff‚Äôs skills as an artist. His duties included serving as an aerial observer with the Air Corps. While airborne, he would hand draw maps of enemy positions for use in planning by the command staff. Radoff loved France and would revisit in 1921 where he met and later married Camille Alice Richard. The couple stayed in France as shop owners until 1932. The Radoff‚Äôs emigrated to the United States for fear of increasing tensions in Europe. They toured the entire US eventually settling in Los Angeles. Their only child, Vivian Renee Radoff, was born in Los Angeles in 1933 and died in Valencia California in 2013. Radoff continually dabbled with sketching over the years. He didn‚Äôt take it up as a vocation until the late 1950s. He was living in Southern California and opened an Art Gallery in the San Fernando Valley. He had galleries in Van Nuys, Corona del Mar and Reseda. He would show his work at the Festival of Arts in Laguna Beach in the mid-1960s. Radoff mostly painted seascapes and florals. He tried some neo-impressionist styles also. He was an admirer of Marc Chagall‚Äôs work. Radoff continued to paint until he had a stroke in 1985. He died a year later in 1986.http://www.askart.com/artist_bio/Charles_Basil_Radoff/11214960/Charles_Basil_Radoff.aspx See also * List of Russian artists References Category:1894 births Category:1986 deaths Category:20th-century Russian painters Category:Russian male painters Category:Christian artists ","title":"Charles Radoff"},{"id":"5048320","text":"Chew Reservoir is a reservoir at the head of the Chew Valley in the Peak District National Park in Greater Manchester, England.

It used slave labor from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp to produce V-2 ballistic missiles, V-1 flying bombs, and other weapons. Mittelwerk GmbH On the night of 17/18 August 1943, RAF bombers carried out Operation Hydra against the Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center where V-2 development and production was being carried out. On 19 October 1943, the German limited company Mittelwerk GmbH was issued War Contract No. 0011-5565/43 by General Emil Leeb, head of the Army Weapons Office, for 12,000 A-4 missiles at 40,000 Reichsmarks each. Mittelwerk GmbH also headed sites for V-2 rocket development and testing at Schlier (Project Zement) and Lehesten. Beginning in May 1944, Georg Rickhey was the Mittelwerk general manager, Albin Sawatzki was the Mittelwerk technical director over both Arthur Rudolph's Technical Division (with deputy Karl Seidenstuecker) and Hans Lindenberg's 50 engineers of the quality control group located at Ilfeld. Other Mittelwerk/Ilfield engineers included Magnus von Braun in turbopump production, Guenther Haukohl who supervised V-2 production after helping design the assembly line, Eric Ball (assembly line), Hans Fridrich, Hans Palaoro and Rudolph Schlidt. The facility had a communications staff under Captain Dr K√ºhle, an Administrative Division run by B√∂rner under Mittelwerk board member Otto Karl Bersch, and a Prisoner Labor Supply office (Brozsat). Hannelore Bannasch was Sawatzki's secretary. Other projects V-1 cruise missile assembly line at the Mittelwerk II underground facility V-2 weapon in Mittelwerk after liberation In July 1944, Hans Kammler ordered the North Works (Nordwerke) to use cross-tunnels 1‚Äì20 for a Junkers jet and piston engine factory, leaving cross-tunnels 21‚Äì46 for Mittelwerk GmbH. During February‚ÄìApril 1945, the Nordhausen plant built Taifun anti-aircraft missiles and Heinkel He 162 jet fighters and put into operation a liquid oxygen plant. The plant was the Eber project and used equipment evacuated from the Watten bunker and elsewhere to build Heylandt liquid oxygen generators; the 15 generators were nearly complete when the site was captured. The Mittelwerk also contained equipment for producing jet fuel, and in an emergency 1944 decentralization program (named Geilenbergprogramm after Edmund Geilenberg) started the \\"Cuckoo\\" project, an underground oil plant to be \\"carved out of the Himmelsburg\\" North of the Mittelwerk. Additional plans for V-2 rocket plants (the Southern Works near Friedrichshafen and the Eastern Works near Riga) were never fulfilled. V-1 flying bomb assembly began during October/November 1944 in the South end of tunnel A. At the end of January 1945, 51 V-1s were shipped from a dispersed Fieseler factory in Upper Bavaria (code name Cham) to the Nordhausen plant for completion. After a second V-1 factory at Burg was closed, the Mittelwerk Werk II in February 1945 was the only factory producing V-1 flying bombs, and a total of 2,275 V-1s were built by Werk II from September 1944 until April 1945. Although there has long been speculation about other \\"exotic\\" weaponry being constructed or stored at Mittelwerk, evidence of this is scarce. For example, Richard Overy notes in The Bombing War - Europe 1939-1945 (2013): \\"There is some evidence that small spherical bombs containing radioactive waste were stored in the Mittelbau-Dora works [...], but it is not conclusive.\\" Evacuation In late February 1945, the Allied Chiefs of Staff discussed a proposed attack on the Nordhausen plant with a highly flammable petroleum-soap mixture that had been used in the Pacific theatre to deeply penetrate buried strongpoints and scourge them with intense heat. The area was attacked with conventional bombs by RAF Bomber Command on 3 & 4 April. What were believed to be barracks were attacked on 3 April but they actually contained forced labour workers. The attack of 4 April hit the barracks and the town of Nordhausen. The Mittelbau-Dora forced labor was evacuated on 4 April, and scientists evacuated to the Alpenfestung (). Hitler had made an order, the \\"Demolitions on Reich Territory Decree\\", which ordered the destruction of any infrastructure that might be of use to the Allies but it was deliberately ignored by Speer and the Nordhausen plant was evacuated without damage. Aftermath Having been warned to \\"expect something a little unusual in the Nordhausen area\\", and after previously entering the Nordhausen plant from the North through the Junkers Nordwerke, U.S. 3rd Armored Division and 104th Infantry Divisions reached the city of Nordhausen on 11 April 1945 and discovered the dead and sick of the Boelcke Kaserne barracks. Casualties of the V-2 rocket are estimated at 2,541 killed and 5,923 injured. By contrast, of the roughly 60,000 people who passed through Mittelbau-Dora and its subcamps, an estimated 20,000 died either at the camp or at places they were subsequently transported to: 350 were hanged (including 200 for sabotage), many others died from exhaustion, cold, malnutrition or disease. Some were murdered by guards. The total also includes 1,300 to 1,500 prisoners killed by British bombs in early April. =Special Mission V-2= A few of these Operation Paperclip scientists had been at the Mittelwerk. On 22 May 1945, US Army Special Mission V-2 shipped the first trainload of rocket parts for use in projects such as Operation Sandy, Operation Blossom and, at the White Sands Proving Grounds, the Hermes project. The Nordhausen area was to become part of the Soviet zone of occupation, and Soviet Army officers arrived to tour the Nordhausen plant on 26 May 1945. In June 1945, the US Army left the Nordhausen plant as required by JCS Directive 1067/14, with parts, machine tools, and documents (including blueprints for the projected A-9/A-10 intercontinental missile) left for the Soviets. The Red Army occupied the Mittelwerk on 5 July 1945 and demolished both of the entrances of the tunnel system in mid-1948. =The Dora War Crimes Trial= Sixteen of the 19 Dora Defendants in 1947 The 1947 Dora Trial convicted SS Officers and concentration camp kapos, while 3 scientists of the V-2 rocket program were implicated (2 after the trial) and exonerated of Nazi war crimes at the Mittelwerk. On 19 May 1947, the former head of the Mittelwerk facility, Georg Rickhey, was extradited to Germany from Wright Field in the U.S. and acquitted of war crimes at the Dora Trial. Arthur Rudolph, after immigrating to the U.S. and playing key roles in the Pershing missile and Apollo programs, was forced to renounce his U.S. citizenship and return to Germany; the West German government, citing the statute of limitations, never charged him and eventually granted him citizenship. Wernher von Braun, the Technical Director of a separate facility at Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center, visited the Mittelwerk on 25 January 1944, and a 1991 author alleged he witnessed Mittelwerk and Buchenwald war crimes. =Ruins= After a new entrance tunnel had been dug to former rail Tunnel A in 1995, 710 meters of the tunnel system were opened for visitors. Large parts of the system are flooded by ground water, while other parts have collapsed. After the reunification of Germany the tunnels were frequently looted by treasure seekers who gained access via the private mine in the north of the Kohnstein. Willi Kramer, a German archaeologist and scientist who dived in the tunnel system in 1992 and 1998, estimated that 70 tons of material was stolen. Access through these entrances was not secured until 2004, when the mine went into insolvency.

Despite considerable budgetary limitations that hampered the post-war Filipino film industry, Avellana's films such as Anak Dalita and Badjao attained international acclaim. In 1976, Avellana was named by President Ferdinand Marcos as the first National Artist of the Philippines for Film. While Avellana remains an important figure in Filipino cinema, his reputation as a film director has since been eclipsed by the next wave of Filipino film directors who emerged in the 1970s, such as Lino Brocka and Ishmael Bernal. Life Born in Bontoc, Mountain Province, Avellana was educated at the Ateneo de Manila AB '37, where he developed what turned out to be a lifelong interest in the theater. He taught at the Ateneo after graduation and married his teen-age sweetheart Daisy Hontiveros, an actress who eventually also became a National Artist in 1999. Film career Avellana made his film debut with Sakay in 1939, a biopic on the early 20th century Filipino revolutionary Macario Sakay. The film was an immediate sensation, particularly distinguished for its realism which was a typical of Filipino cinema at the time. The treatment is the subject of some controversy today. Avellana's Sakay toed the line with the American-fostered perception of Sakay as a mere bandit, different from the current-day appreciation of Sakay as a fighter for Filipino independence. Raymond Red's 1993 film, Sakay hews closer to this modern view of Sakay. Leopoldo Salcedo, who played Sakay in the 1939 Avellana version, portrayed Sakay's father in the 1993 version in his final film role. Avellana directed more than 70 films in a career that spanned six decades. Anak Dalita (1956) and Badjao (1957) perhaps stand as the most prominent works from his oeuvre. Anak Dalita, which was named Best Film at the 1956 Asia-Pacific Film Festival, was a realistic portrayal of poverty-stricken Filipinos coping with the aftermath of World War II. Badjao was a love-story among the sea-dwelling Badjaos, an indigenous Filipino people hailing from Mindanao. Rolf Bayer was the screenwriter for both films.

The brigade was a 1st Line Territorial Army formation, consisting of three infantry battalions converted into armoured regiments. History The 11th Armoured Brigade was formed from the redesignation of the 126th Infantry Brigade, part of 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division, on 1 November 1941. During this time, the brigade formed part of the 42nd Armoured Division. On 25 July 1942, the brigade was converted from an armoured role (equipped with cruiser tanks) into an infantry support role (equipped with infantry tanks). As part of this conversion, the brigade was re-designated the 11th Tank Brigade. During most of 1943, the brigade was attached to the 77th Infantry (Reserve) Division as a training formation. On 23 November, the brigade was disbanded and its regiments were broken up. Order of battle Subordinate units included: * 107th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (previously 5th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)) * 110th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (previously 5th Battalion, Border Regiment) * 111th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (previously 5th Battalion, Manchester Regiment) * 1st Battalion, Highland Light Infantry Commanders * Brigadier H.L.

Life Margaret was the second child of King Henry III of England and his wife, Eleanor of Provence, and was born at Windsor Castle. Margaret's first appearance in historical record comes when she was three years old, when she and her brother, the future Edward I, took part in an event in London. King Alexander II of Scotland had previously been married to her paternal aunt, Joan of England. In 1244, her father and Alexander II met in Newcastle to resume peaceful relations between the two nations, and it was decided that the future Alexander III of Scotland should marry Margaret. She was betrothed the same year. She was married on 25 December 1251, when she was 11 years old, at York Minster, to King Alexander III of Scotland, who was 10 years of age. The couple remained in York until January the following year, when they continued to their residence in Edinburgh. Margaret is said to have been unhappy in Scotland, and created some tensions between England and Scotland by writing to her family in England that she was poorly treated in Scotland. Because of their age, it was not considered suitable for the royal couple to have sexual intercourse. Margaret was therefore not allowed to see Alexander very often, and because she had evidently been given a good impression of him and came to be fond of him, this made her displeased. Further more, she did not like the royal castle and hated Edinburgh, or the climate in Scotland, and she missed England and her family there. She wrote of her homesickness and complaints to her parents, who asked for her to visit them. The Scots, however, refused permission, because of the risk that she would never return. In 1255, Queen Eleanor sent her physician to Edinburgh to investigate Margaret's well being. He reported that she was pale and depressed, and complained about loneliness and neglect. Her father sent a new delegation, wrote to some of the Scottish earls and demanded that she be better treated. Queen Margaret complained to her father's envoys that she was kept as a prisoner without the permission to travel, and that she was not allowed to see her spouse nor be intimate with him. After this, the king of England and the regency council of Scotland came to an agreement. It was agreed that as the royal couple were now fourteen, they should be allowed to consummate their marriage, and the regency council would be obliged to turn the power over to Alexander in seven years time: Alexander would be obliged to give Margaret physical affection, and allow her freedom to travel to visit her parents. The same year, 7 September 1255, Margaret and Alexander III visited her parents and Margaret's sister Beatrice at Wark. Margaret stayed a bit longer in England after her spouse's departure, but soon followed him when the agreement was secured. In 1257, Margaret and Alexander were captured and held prisoner by the Comyn family, who demanded the expulsion of all foreigners from Scotland. They were eventually released after the intervention of her father and the Scottish regency council. She visited England in 1260‚Äì61, to give birth to her daughter Margaret, and 1269, to attend the translation of Edward the Confessor's relics to Westminster Abbey, both times in the company of Alexander. She was not able to attend her father's funeral in 1272 because of her pregnancy. It was said that Margaret was responsible for the death of a young courtier, who reputedly had killed her uncle Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. She had been given this esquire as a gift from her brother Edward, who visited her in 1257. This incident took place at Kinclaven Castle near Perth in the summer of 1273, where she recuperated after the birth of her son David. While walking along the River Tay accompanied by her confessor, some maidens and several esquires one evening after supper, an English esquire went down to the river to wash his hand clean from some clay. She jokingly pushed him into the river, but he was swept to his death by a powerful current before anyone could help. This was done as a joke, and according to her confessor, she had told her maidens to push him, and everyone had laughed at first, thinking there was no danger for the esquire's life. He was, however, seized by a heavy current, and both he, as well as his servant boy who jumped in to save him, drowned. Margaret was reportedly very upset by the incident. Margaret and Alexander were present at the coronation of Edward I in Westminster in August 1274. Margaret died on 26 February 1275 at Cupar Castle, and was buried at Dunfermline Abbey, Fife. Issue The couple had three children: * Margaret (28 February 1261 ‚Äì 9 April 1283), who married King Eric II of Norway. * Alexander (21 January 1264 Jedburgh ‚Äì 28 January 1284 Lindores Abbey). * David (20 March 1272 ‚Äì June 1281 Stirling Castle); buried in Dunfermline Abbey.

Its use can be detected in urine. 4-AT is a potent irreversible aromatase inhibitor that inhibits estrogen biosynthesis by permanently binding and inactivating aromatase in adipose and peripheral tissue. Aromatase is responsible for the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. Blocking aromatase causes the body to decrease in levels of estradiol, which then results in increase of LH and consequently, testosterone. Since testosterone has myotropic activity and estradiol does not, elevated testosterone levels increase muscle mass. However, there appear to be no human or animal studies testing the hypothesis that 4-AT will produce an anabolic effect. 4-AT is also used by steroid or prohormone users to counteract estrogen level increases caused by aromatization during their steroid cycle. This helps minimize side effects such as gynecomastia but can lead to acne. Also, after a steroid cycle, the compound may be used to shorten the recovery from the testicular suppression that can be the result of the use of steroids. Baylor University conducted an eight-week study to determine the effects of 300 mg or 600 mg of 4-AT in resistance-trained males. Compared to baseline, free testosterone increased by 90% for 300 mg group and 84% for 600 mg group, respectively. Also dihydrotestosterone and the ratio of free testosterone to estradiol increased significantly. The report concluded that \\"[t]he results of this study indicate that eight weeks of 6-OXO supplementation had no effect on body composition or clinical safety markers, but incompletely inhibited aromatase activity and significantly increased endogenous DHT levels that were attenuated after a three-week washout period\\". This study did not utilize a control group and was funded in part by two producers of commercial 4-AT. In a FDA Warning Letter dated July 7, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) argues that marketing of 4-AT violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and as such products containing it are adulterated by legal definition. In 2008, Health Canada issued a warning that 4-AT had a health risk related to blood clotting and recommended all users immediately cease use.

He worked as a football summariser/analyst for BBC Radio Lancashire, commentating on football games in North West England;Blackburn Rovers,Burnley,Blackpool and Preston North End. Background Richard never played professional football, only ever playing amateur football. He gained a Diploma in Physical Education at Carnegie College,Leeds. He was a teacher in Darwen Lancashire teaching Physical Education. Dinnis was also a physical education teacher at Clitheroe Royal Grammar School between 2002‚Äì2003. He obtained his Football Association 'A' Licence coaches badge and then was employed as reserve team coach at Blackburn Rovers]1970-1975.]. When their manager, Gordon Lee took over as manager at Newcastle United, he appointed Dinnis as first team coach. During the 1975‚Äì76 season Dinnis was a peripheral figure. Dinnis himself always said that his main job was to support Gordon Lee. At the start of the 1976‚Äì77 season Dinnis took over the coaching duties with Lee picking and motivating the team. In 1976 Newcastle went to the League Cup Final against Manchester City with Gordon Lee as manager and Dinnis as coach. Caretaker manager When Gordon Lee suddenly resigned as manager in early 1977 after only 18 months in charge, the Newcastle board first offered the job to the Bolton Wanderers manager, Ian Greaves but he turned the job down. The board made a surprising attempt to involve some players in the decision over who should be the next manager. It led to one of the most controversial months in the club history and to the appointment of Dinnis as Caretaker manager until the end of the season. Under Dinnis, the team's form was such that they found themselves with an outside chance of the League championship, but would lose four of the last five games. Nevertheless, Newcastle finished the season in fifth place in the First Division and qualified for the UEFA Cup with a win over Aston Villa in their final home game of the season on 16 May 1977. It was the club's highest league position for 25 years and the first time they had qualified for Europe for seven years. Nine days later and after much boardroom deliberation Dinnis was offered a two-year contract as Newcastle manager. Newcastle manager Newcastle started the 1977‚Äì78 season with a 3‚Äì2 home win over Leeds United, however they then lost the next three matches. In September they lost at home to West Ham United and the Directors issued Dinnis with an ultimatum before the next game at West Bromwich Albion which they again lost 3-0; a result which left Newcastle bottom of the league. Newcastle then met Irish Premier League club, Bohemians in the UEFA Cup, a game they were expected to win, but they drew 0‚Äì0.They then won the Home Leg 4-0 to qualify for the next round,where they were defeated by a Johnny Rep inspired Bastia,who went on to the Final. The next game Newcastle again lost 3‚Äì0, this time to Birmingham City, followed by a fourth consecutive defeat to Coventry City. Dinnis survived despite crisis board meetings. However, following criticism of the board by Dinnis in the media, he was sacked as manager on 9 November 1977. Dinnis was in charge for six months and 21 games. His overall record was nine wins, seven draws and five defeats. He coached Philadelphia Fury of the North American Soccer League in 1978, but resigned mid-season and replaced by player-coach Alan Ball. He then went on to be Youth Coach with Vancouver Whitecaps,working with Head Coach Tony Waiters and G.M.Les Wilson before returning to the U.K. as coach to Middlesbrough,and Director of Burnley F.C.Centre of Excellence. He was for 12 years a summariser/analyst for B.B.C.Radio Lancashire,dealing with Blackburn Rovers,Blackpool,Burnley and Preston North End. http://national.soccerhall.org/history/NASL_AllTimeCoachesRegistry.html http://www.philadelphiaatoms.com/pseudoatoms.html References Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:English football managers Category:Barrow A.F.C. managers Category:Newcastle United F.C. managers Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) coaches Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Association footballers not categorized by position ","title":"Richard Dinnis"},{"id":"5048504","text":"28th NSFC Awards January 3, 1994 \\\\ Best Film: Schindler's List The 28th National Society of Film Critics Awards, given on 3 January 1994, honored the best filmmaking of 1993.

Alper appeared in more than 200 films and TV series from the 1930s to the end of the 1960s. Quite often his work was uncredited and he never received a top billing in one of his movies. His first known screen credit was in The Royal Family of Broadway (1930) a part he had already played on Broadway in 1927/28. His signature character was a chatty taxi driver, which he played at least 20 times, most notably in The Maltese Falcon (1941) as a friendly cabbie who drives Sam Spade, played by Humphrey Bogart, during a mid-film wild goose chase, as well as in such other well-known films as The Big Broadcast of 1937, Lady in the Dark and Angel on My Shoulder. His biggest role should have been the part of Gus Smith in the Alfred Hitchcock film Lifeboat in 1943. Due to his becoming ill right before the start of shooting in August, he was replaced by actor William Bendix. However, he worked for Hitchcock on three other movies: Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941), again as a cabbie, Saboteur (1942), and Strangers on a Train (1951). Frequently seen in comedies, Alper was featured in the Three Stooges films Tricky Dicks (1953) and The Outlaws Is Coming (1965). One of Alper's least characteristic roles was the judo instructor in Jerry Lewis' The Nutty Professor (1963).

One use of the command is to create highly visible separator pages for print jobs. Operation Each argument is truncated at 10 characters and printed on a \\"line\\" of its own. To print multiple words on a single line, they must therefore be passed as a single argument, which is done from the shell by escaping or quoting the words as appropriate. A related and more flexible program is FIGlet, which can display text in different fonts and orientations. Implementation The way that the program is implemented internally is antiquated. The character fonts used are hardwired into the program code itself, as statically initialized data structures. Two data structures are used. The first is a data table comprising a sequence of printing instructions that encode the bitmap for each character (in an encoding specific to the \`banner\` program). The second is an index into that table that indicates, for each character code, where the printing instructions for that character begin and end. Both data structures were hand-written. Spinellis observes that it is \\"difficult to come up with a more error-prone and unmaintainable data format\\". He observes a stark contrast between the source code of the \`banner\` program and automatically generated source code for encoding computer fonts into program data (using the 6-by-10 font data in the source code of the mac68k port of NetBSD for comparison). The automatically generated data are commented, documenting with ASCII art how the bit patterns were derived. The automatically generated data were generated from a bitmap file, itself generated using a bitmap creation/editing program with a graphical user interface. And the automatically generated data are organized in a straightforward and obvious manner ‚Äî a fixed-length sequence of unencoded bytes for each glyph. Spinellis further observes that in modern computer systems it is seldom sensible to embed such data into the program executable image itself, the performance gains of doing so being negligible. Doing so makes it difficult to adapt the program to different locales, or to maintain the program. The more preferred approach in modern systems is to store such data in a separate data file, distinct from the program executable image file, or in a resource fork of the program, that the program reads at run-time.

As host of Ontario Morning in the late 1980s, he was known for his keen mind, calm demeanour, and melodious voice. \\"He had a full, rich voice not often heard in modern radio,\\" said Canadian freelance broadcaster James Careless, who worked with Saxberg at Ontario Morning. \\"He was truly a class act both on and off the air.\\" Saxberg left Ontario Morning to become one of the original CBC Newsworld TV anchors from the latter's start in 1989. Saxberg served with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for 27 years and was popular with news audiences. He was also an active volunteer with the Canadian Media Guild. Saxberg received an Edward R. Murrow Award for his work on the 2005 coverage of the 60th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

He died in a snorkeling accident in Phuket, Thailand, where he was on vacation. He was 47 years old.

It was formed by bassist Ricardo Iorio in 1987 after his previous band V8 disbanded. Herm√©tica was signed to the independent record label Radio Tr√≠poli Discos throughout their career. The band's initial lineup consisted of Iorio, vocalist Claudio O'Connor, drummer Fabi√°n Spataro and guitarist Antonio Romano. Spataro left the band in 1988 and was replaced by Antonio Scotto. This lineup recorded their eponymous album, the first thrash metal album recorded in Argentina. At this point of their career, Herm√©tica performed mainly in Argentina, except for one concert held in Uruguay. In 1990, they released Int√©rpretesan extended play which included covers of Argentine rock and tango songs. Both albums were released by Radio Tr√≠poli Discos as a single CD when digital technology became available. Scotto left the band in 1991 and was replaced by drummer Claudio Strunz. This lineup recorded the band's second studio album, √Åcido Argentino. Herm√©tica opened for Black Sabbath and Mot√∂rhead during their visits to Argentina, but had to cancel their headlining tour in Paraguay. They recorded a live album, En vivo 1993 Argentina, and took part in a concert at a penal facility. They participated in the first Argentine Monsters of Rock festival, which featured Black Sabbath, Slayer, and Kiss. Their last studio album, V√≠ctimas del Vaciamiento, was released in 1994. To promote the album, the group held a concert at the Obras Sanitarias stadium later that year. Herm√©tica disbanded at the end of 1994, a few days before their second concert in Obras. Ricardo Iorio, who performed lead vocals on a number of tracks, formed a new band Almafuerte and served as its vocalist. The remaining ex-members of Herm√©tica hired a new bassist and created the band Mal√≥n. Both bands began a mutual rivalry after their respective establishment. History =Early years and Herm√©tica (1987‚Äì1989)= Herm√©tica logo. Ricardo Iorio was the frontman and bassist of the band V8, which broke up in 1987. After its disbandment, Iorio formed Herm√©tica, which had a similar musical style to V8. Initially, he tried to work with Mart√≠n Knye, a former member of Kamikaze, but after two meetings, the idea was abandoned. Iorio then appointed the guitarist Antonio Romano from the band Cerbero, who had been previously considered for V8. Iorio wanted Romano to be both a vocalist and bassist, but his manager Marcelo Tommy persuaded Iorio to hire someone else. Iorio eventually chose Claudio O'Connor for vocals and Fabi√°n Spataro from the band Mark as drummer. They began to practice at Villa Ballester in 1987. The name of the band is a reference to hermeticism; Iorio saw similarities between the hermetic doctrine and the context of the Argentine heavy metal.Blumetti, p. 2 The first songs composed by Iorio were \\"Sepulcro Civil\\", \\"Masa Anestesiada\\", and \\"Cr√°neo Candente\\". The band's first show was in a pub called \\"Helloween\\" in San Mart√≠n, on May 7, 1988. Although Horcas had been established before Herm√©tica by Osvaldo Civilea fellow member of V8Herm√©tica was the first of the two bands to perform a live concert. Spataro left the band in 1988 because of a labor dispute. He was replaced by drummer Tony Scotto, who was introduced by friends of the band. He performed his first concert with the band in August at the \\"S√°enz Pe√±a\\" clubwhere Spataro played for the last time. The fanzine Zote organized a free concert at the main plaza of Lomas de Zamora, but it was canceled because of the failed military uprising of the Carapintadas insurgents.Blumetti, pp. 2‚Äì3 Herm√©tica made regular appearances at the Arlequines theater in San Telmo in 1989. They were the first heavy metal band to play there. They performed with the bands Doppler, 666, Militia, Genocidio, Ultraje, Cross, Legi√≥n, and Devastaci√≥n. Herm√©tica wanted to record their first album but the national economic crisis had a negative impact on the project. The fanzine \\"Rebellion Rock\\" proposed an independent production, which would be sold at Parque Centenario, but the band rejected this offer. They also rejected working for EMI and instead signed for a new label, Radio Tr√≠poli Discos. They signed a contract in May 1989, and two months later the band began to record the LP at the Sonovisi√≥n studios. The eponymous album Herm√©tica was released in November 1989. It was the first thrash metal album to be recorded in Argentina. Ricardo Iorio made his debut as lead vocalist on the song \\"Desde el Oeste\\". Herm√©tica performed a concert in C√≥rdoba, with the band Hammer. Alberto Zamarbide, a former singer with V8, made a guest appearance during a concert in Mataderos. Herm√©tica ended the year by performing two concerts with Pappo's new band Pappo & The Widowmakers.Blumetti, pp. 3‚Äì4 =Int√©rpretes and √Åcido Argentino (1990‚Äì1992)= Herm√©tica performed many concerts at Cemento. Herm√©tica performed their only concert outside of Argentina in the early 1990s at the \\"Club Platense\\" in Montevideo, Uruguay. They played with Retrosat√°n and Alvacast,two bands from Uruguay. Herm√©tica had to spend the night in the street because of the faulty Uruguayan production. Once they returned to Argentina, they performed at several locations in Buenos Aires and in Mar del Plata with Divididos, Los Violadores, Ar√°cnido and Rata Blanca. They were offered a chance to record an EP with only 27 hours of recording time. They accepted the proposal, and recorded improvised cover versions of songs by V8, Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, Enrique Santos Disc√©polo, Mot√∂rhead, and Manal. Iorio, a fan of a band called Budgie, made deliberate similarities to Metallica's cover EP, The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisitedwhich included a cover version of a song by that band. Herm√©tica performed at the \\"Metal en acci√≥n\\" festival at the Jos√© Amalfitani Stadium, sharing the bill with 2112, Lethal, Horcas, Kamikaze, Alakran, and Riff.Blumetti, pp. 4‚Äì5 The band searched for a new concert venue because the Arlequines was becoming too small for their growing audience. They moved to Cemento, where most of the 1991 concerts took place. They played with the bands Todos tus muertos, Pobres pibes, Nepal, Militia, Devastaci√≥n, Rapier, and Resistencia Nativa. Their albums Herm√©tica and Int√©rpreteswhich had been released as LP records and cassettes, were released by Tripoli on a single compact disc. Tony Scotto left the band because of creative differences and was replaced by Claudio Strunz. Strunz, drummer of the band Heinkel and owner of Herm√©tica's rehearsal room, had already played with the band during practice sessions when Scotto was absent. He made his debut at Sunchales. The band appeared in two television programs, La movida del '90 and Siglo XX Cambalache and recorded their second full-length album, √Åcido Argentino, with 150 hours of recording time at the Aguilar studios. It was released at Cemento on December 27.Blumetti, p. 5 Following an avalanche at San Carlos Minas in January 1992, Herm√©tica joined a charity music festival held at the Chateau Carreras stadium. Herm√©tica played only a few songs at a concert with Riffthe headline band, which ended with minor riots. Herm√©tica were the opening act for Black Sabbath at Obras Sanitarias; Black Sabbath's frontman Ronnie James Dio thanked the band for playing with them. The band leased 25% of the copyright of their songs to Daniel Grinbank, the businessman who brought rock bands to Argentina to play with Black Sabbath. In October 1992, they were the supporting band for Mot√∂rhead in Obras. They were offered a concert in Paraguay, but once in the country the show's producers tried to pay less money than had been agreed. Unable to find an alternative location, the band refused to play and returned to Argentina.Blumetti, pp. 5‚Äì6 =Live albums and V√≠ctimas del Vaciamiento (1993‚Äì1994)= Herm√©tica toured Patagonia at the beginning of 1993. In March that year, √Åcido Argentino was certified gold by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers (CAPIF), having shipped 30,000 copies in Argentina. Tripoli invited them to produce a new studio album in Miami or Los √Ångeles but the band refused, preferring to stay in Argentina. Herm√©tica was scheduled to support Megadeth, but their guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine had health problems which forced the band to cancel the concert. They received proposals to play with Metallica, but rejected the required terms of the contract. After touring in Rosario and Greater Buenos Aires, Herm√©tica performed their first concert in Buenos Aires on May 15, 1993, at Stadium, a new concert hall with a capacity of 5,000. They recorded the live album En vivo 1993 Argentina and a home video. The album included a heavy metal cover version of \\"Si se calla el cantor\\", a song first recorded by folk singer Jos√© Larralde. This album ended the contract with Radio Tr√≠poli, which was renewed. Herm√©tica performed at the Olmos penal facility on August 17, along with Lethal, A.N.I.M.A.L., Massacre, Attaque 77, Pilsen and the British U.K. Subs. The concert was presented by the radio host Norberto Verea, and was recorded and released on a live CD named \\"Radio Olmos\\". The band performed another concert at Stadium on September 4, and began to produce their third studio album.Blumetti, pp. 6‚Äì7 Herm√©tica was part of the 1994 edition of the Monsters of Rock festival in Buenos Aires, alongside Black Sabbath, Slayer, and Kiss. Shortly after, they released their third studio album, V√≠ctimas del Vaciamiento. As the Stadium's hall was not big enough to accommodate the audience, they held a concert at Estadio Obras Sanitarias. Herm√©tica recorded their performance and released it as a live album titled Lo √∫ltimo. Meanwhile, their newest studio album received gold certification. The band recorded a cover version of a folk song, \\"De los pagos del tiempo\\", also by Larralde. The band had received proposals to play at Obras the previous year, which the accepted with the condition that they would organize it themselves. =Disbandment= Herm√©tica's last concert was held in Mar del Plata. Their second concert in Obras was canceled; rumors that Iorio had contracted hepatitis B turned out to be false. The other members sent him a formal request to attend the concert but Iorio refused and the band broke up. Iorio did not attend any meeting since then and ordered the other band members to stop using the name Herm√©tica, which Iorio had invented. Iorio gave his first interviews after the break-up to the Clar√≠n newspaper and the other members to the music magazine Madhouse. Iorio said that the band had always been united, but few weeks before their final concert, the members were not talking to each other. He said he had lied about having hepatitis B, expecting to end the hostilities, but it did not work. Iorio flew from Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires to avoid seeing the other members, who returned by bus. O'Connor, Romano, and Strunz stated in Madhouse magazine that the harsh relation was because Iorio had not consulted the others about the decisions he was making, that he received most of the money, and that he avoided meeting them when they were discussing the problems in the band. The concert in Obras was filmed and released as a live album. The first edition was released under the name Lo √öltimo with a black front-cover; it was edited in studio to match the quality of a regular studio CD. It was later reissued as a double album titled \\"En Concierto\\"; this version was not edited in the studio and reinstated the raw sound of the band's live performance. Ricardo Iorio started a new band, Almafuerte, with guitarist Claudio Marciello and drummer Claudio Cardacci. Iorio took lead vocal duties and included covers of Herm√©tica and V8 songs in his new band's repertoire. O'Connor, Romano, and Strunz hired a new bassist, Karlos Cuadrado, and formed the band Mal√≥n. The bands became rivals; Herm√©tica's popularity was inherited by both bands. A 1995 poll among readers of Madhouse was led by members or works of both bands in all national categories. Herm√©tica remained a popular band in the Argentine heavy metal scene, even among the younger fans who had never seen the band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion. At the 2011 reunion of Mal√≥n, Claudio O'Connor said that their personal conflicts with Iorio would not allow it and that they would not reunite the band if the four members do not have a good personal relationship. Style and lyrics Graffiti in Buenos Aires, which reads \\"La H no muri√≥\\" (). Herm√©tica was a thrash metal band, drawing influences from Mot√∂rhead, Megadeth, and Black Sabbath. Their music was composed primarily by bassist Ricardo Iorio with occasional input from guitarist Antonio Romano, who composed the guitar solos. The band used a counterpoint between the singing styles of their two vocalists; lead singer Claudio O'Connor's vocals were high pitched, while Iorio had a raucous style of singing. Iorio sang segments of some songs but rarely performed songs in their entirety. Iorio thought that his singing style in Herm√©tica was inferior to his later work with Almafuerte because the songs had not been composed specifically for him. The success of Herm√©tica's second studio album √Åcido Argentino allowed the band to increase the budget for the production of its follow-up, V√≠ctimas del Vaciamiento. Iorio proposed re- recording the band's first album with drummer Claudio Strunz and a higher budget, but the label refused his proposal. The musical style of Herm√©tica was considered to be old-fashioned. The band achieved success as a result of their introspective lyrics. Unlike most heavy metal bands, Herm√©tica's music was appealing to poor people. Iorio wrote about his thoughts and concerns from a personal perspective.Blumetti, p. 1 He stated that some of his lyrics were inspired by 1940s Argentine tango music. Herm√©tica was part of the Rock chab√≥n movement within Argentine rock; their music was influenced by Argentine nationalism, family values and neighbourhood-centered localism.Hern√°ndez, p. 278 Iorio said that he does not support racism or fascism. The lyrics, except for covers, were always written in Spanish because Iorio does not approve of artists who write in English to gain foreign audience. The first two albums addressed a variety of topics; the track \\"Memoria de siglos\\" (\\"Memory of centuries\\") references the cult of personality, buck passing, peace through strength, and wage slavery. Each song from their third album is devoted to a different subject.

Estonia became the first nation to hold legally binding general elections over the Internet with their pilot project for the municipal elections in 2005. The electronic voting system withstood the test of reality and was declared a success by Estonian election officials.Reports and Statistics about Internet Voting in Estonia The Estonian parliamentary election in 2007 also used internet voting, another world first.Estonia to hold first national Internet election, News.com, February 21, 2007  Internet voting  The term Power voting (or e-voting) can refer to both fixed voting locations (as in voting booths) and remote (as in over the Internet) electronic voting, in order to reduce the confusion between the two the electronic voting in Estonia is called i-Voting. The security model is modeled after the way in which advance voting and postal voting is handled.  Overview of Estonian Internet voting  The Estonian internet voting system builds on the Estonian ID card. The card is a regular and mandatory national identity document as well as a smart card allowing for both secure remote authentication and legally binding digital signatures by using the Estonian state supported public key infrastructure.What is the ID card? As of March 2007 over 1.08 million cards have been issued (out of a population of about 1.32 million).ID Card Issuing Statistics info-box at the top of the page Internet voting is available during an early voting period (sixth day to fourth day prior to Election Day). Voters can change their electronic votes an unlimited number of times, with the final vote being tabulated. It is also possible for anyone who votes using the Internet to vote at a polling station during the early voting period, invalidating their Internet vote. It is not possible to change or annul the electronic vote on the Election Day. A comparison of the cost-efficiency of the different voting channels offered in the Estonian Municipal Elections (2017) concluded that the Internet Voting is the most cost-efficient voting channel offered by the Estonian Electoral System. The principle of \\"one person, one vote\\" is sustained as the voter can potentially cast more than one ballot but still only a single vote. This was challenged in August 2005 by Arnold R√º√ºtel, the President of Estonia, who saw the new e-voting provisions in the Local Government Council Election Act as a breach of the principle of equality of voting. The President brought a petition against the e-voting provisions to Estonian Supreme Court but lost.Judgment of the Constitutional Review Chamber of the Supreme Court, Case No. 3-4-1-13-05 = Transparency and verifiability = According to 2011 recommendation of OSCE/ODIHR election observers and because of voting client hacking case brought to Supreme Court in 2011, Estonia implemented verification of the vote for individual voter in 2013. Verification is done using smartphone application, using QR code from the screen of desktop voting client, after which on the screen of smartphone verification application displays the name and number of the candidate the vote was cast for. Individual verification is implemented for the voter to verify that the vote cast was stored on vote collecting server up to 30 minutes or one hour, depending on the election. There are no direct means for the voter to verify that the vote was also tallied as cast. Server side source code of voting system was published in June 2013 because of pressure by civil society lead by computer scientist Tanel Tammet, one of the authors of research papers on requirements for electronic voting from 2001. The code was published on GitHub and has been available for all following elections. Neither voting client source code nor reference code has been published as election officials determined this would make it easy for malevolent actors to build fake clients. As voting protocol is public, anyone can build a client. Again, motivated by report of OSCE/ODIHR election observers in 2015, extensive reports of independent observing team lead by J Alex Halderman in 2015 and public pressure by local activists, universal verifiability of vote tallying was introduced in 2017. Verification of the tally is done by mixnet making use of homomorphic properties elGamal encryption provided by library by Douglas Wikstr√∂m. Universal verification of the tally is not a mandatory part of the process and is conducted by the dedicated data auditor. Tallying the votes with mixnet is done in parallel with plain text extraction of the votes from encrypted envelopes, which are decrypted using secret key of voting commission and of which the digital signatures of voters are removed during the process. Although white paper of the 2017-2019 implementation of electronic voting system claims to embrace end-to-end verifiability, this has been denied by independent researchers. Inclusive working group to assess \\"verifiability, security and transparency\\" of the electronic voting was created by minister of entrepreneurship and information technology of newly elected government in June 2019, which produced a report consisting of 25 improvement proposals, proposals 11, 13 and 25 referring to the problems with the concept of verifiability. The coalition agreement of government also states the need for independent international audit for the system.  Criticism  Despite praise from Estonian election officials, computer security experts from outside the country that have reviewed the system have voiced criticism, warning that any voting system which transmits voted ballots electronically cannot be secure.\\"Report on the Estonian Internet voting system,\\" Sept. 3, 2011. https://www.verifiedvoting.org/report-on-the-estonian-internet-voting- system-2/ This criticism was underscored in May 2014 when a team of International computer security experts released the results of their examination of the system, claiming they could be able to breach the system, change votes and vote totals, and erase any evidence of their actions if they could install malware on the election servers.\\"Independent Report on E-voting in Estonia,\\" https://estoniaevoting.org/ The team advised the Estonian government to halt all online voting, because of the potential threats that it possessed for their government. The Estonian National Electoral Committee reviewed the concerns and published a response saying that the claims \\"give us no reason to suspend online balloting\\"; the purported vulnerabilities were said to be either not feasible in reality or already accounted for in the design of the e-voting system.Comment on the article published in The Guardian The Estonian Information System Authority also responded to the claims, describing them as a political, rather than technical, attack on the e-voting system, and criticizing the method of disclosure.E-voting is (too) secure The connection of international researchers group to the Estonian Centre Party (which has long been critical of e-voting) has also been a common speculation among Estonian state officials and has been even suggested by prime minister.Attacks on Estonia's e-voting are political rather than technicalSecurity Analysis of Estonia's Internet Voting System [31c3 by J. Alex Halderman]\\"The criticism made headlines in the international media, receiving coverage from The Guardian and the BBC. This led to a public debate between Alex Halderman and the Estonian authorities. According to Professor Robert Krimmer, the report had many valid points, although the assessment of the impact could be debated.

Server side code was published with Creative Commons BY- NC-ND license on GitHub as result of those efforts in July 2013.Release of E-Election Software Code 'Did Not Go Far Enough' OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission has voiced concerns about Estonian e-voting during all parliament elections, starting from proposal to suspend e-voting if the problems are not addressed in 2007,\\"Yet, unless the above-mentioned factors are effectively addressed, the authorities should reconsider whether the internet should be widely available as a voting method, or alternatively whether it should be used only on a limited basis or at all.\\" then in 2011 suggesting election commission should create an inclusive working group for improving e-voting and implement cryptographic measures to ensure voting is observable\\"In recent years, advances have been made in the field of cryptography to enable end-to-end verification of the votes cast, i.e. a possibility for an individual voter to verify that his/her vote was (i) cast as intended, (ii) recorded as cast, and (iii) counted as recorded. /‚Äî/ Estonia's Internet voting system does not employ such tools. /‚Äî/ The OSCE/ODIHR recommends that the NEC forms an inclusive working group to consider the use of a verifiable Internet voting scheme or an equally reliable mechanism for the voter to check whether or not his/her vote was changed by malicious software.\\" and noting that verification implemented for 2015 only partially addresses previous recommendation.\\"The NEC introduced a verification process for voters to confirm that their online vote was cast as intended and recorded on the ballot storage server as cast, which partially addressed an OSCE/ODIHR recommendation.\\" In 2012 overview of international experience with e-voting, IFES independent researchers notice that although insofar successful, in situation of \\"emerging international electoral standards with respect to Internet voting\\" Estonian voting system faces necessary improvements for \\"better legislation, a transparent policy and formalized procedures\\" as well as \\"broader democratic goals, such as enhancing civic e-participation\\" need to be considered.International Experience with E-Voting In 2013 Free Software Foundation Europe criticized partial publishing of the source code of e-voting system and for using non-software licenses for publication. FSFE also suggests researching into solutions that lessen reliance on system administrators and instead build the system on cryptographic models of trust. Since the weakest part of voting infrastructure is voter's computer, FSFE suggests Estonia should mitigate the risks of unnoticed subversion of votes in compromised client machines and \\"publicise the dangers as widely as possible, along with instructions to minimise the risk and rectify the situation should a risk realise\\".Open Letter on Freedom and Internet Voting to Estonia's National Electoral Committee There have been also attempts to expose problems of voting system by proofs of concept. In 2011 Paavo Pihelgas created a trojan that was theoretically able to change voter's choice without user noticing. He used this as basis for filing an election complaint and demanded that Supreme Court invalidates election results. The court dismissed the case because Pihelgas's \\"voter's rights had not been infringed as long as he had knowingly put himself into the situation\\".OSCE findings on Estonian e-votingComplaint of Paavo Pihelgas to invalidate the electronic voting results of 2011 parliament elections In 2015, an activist from the Estonian Pirate Party, M√§rt P√µder, took credit for casting an invalid ballot \\"using a GNU debugger to locate the breakpoint in Linux IVCA where the candidate number is stored and replace it with an invalid candidate number\\". Being only one among 176 491 e-voters to do it, the activist explained to the media that client application source code should be opened up and taught as part of general education in public schools to make people trust e-voting.Kuidas ma e-valimisi otsast natuke h√§kkisin Later negotiating with electoral commission an activist went on to stress that end- to-end verifiability is a prerequisite for reliable e-voting and that the whole process of planning, procuring and implementing e-voting should be conducted also in English and that way opened up to international community for proper scrutiny.P√º√ºan n√º√ºd aktivistina olla l√§bipaistvuse osas riigile eeskujuks ja annan teada, et k√§isin neljap√§eval Vabariigi Valimiskomisjonis vestluselVaadeldamatu e-h√§√§letus pole usaldusv√§√§rne In 2016 University of Oxford computer scientists while acknowledging relative success of conducting e-voting claimed that e-voting system officials \\"have relied since the system‚Äôs inception on building trust through interpersonal relations\\" and that \\"may work well for a close-knit society such as that of Estonia\\", however \\"informal processes (including lessons learned) should be further clarified and formally documented\\".An Independent Assessment of the Procedural Components of the Estonian Internet Voting System In beginning of June 2019, minister of entrepreneurship and information technology Kert Kingo of the newly elected government created an inclusive working group to assess the \\"verifiability, security and transparency\\" of the Estonian electronic voting system. The working group consisted of state officials, representatives from universities and research institutes, critics, and creators of the system. In December 2019 they presented results of the six-month investigation, with 25 proposals for improving the core infrastructure of the Estonian e-voting system.

Estonia Category:Politics of Estonia ","title":"Electronic voting in Estonia"},{"id":"5048660","text":"Restraints of trade is a common law doctrine relating to the enforceability of contractual restrictions on freedom to conduct business. It is a precursor of modern competition law. In an old leading case of Mitchel v Reynolds (1711) Lord Smith LC said,Mitchel v Reynolds (1711) 1 P Wms 181 > it is the privilege of a trader in a free country, in all matters not > contrary to law, to regulate his own mode of carrying it on according to his > own discretion and choice. If the law has regulated or restrained his mode > of doing this, the law must be obeyed. But no power short of the general law > ought to restrain his free discretion. A contractual undertaking not to trade is void and unenforceable against the promisor as contrary to the public policy of promoting trade, unless the restraint of trade is reasonable to protect the interest of the purchaser of a business.Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co [1894] AC 535 Restraints of trade can also appear in post-termination restrictive covenants in employment contracts. History Chief Justice Coke, 17th century English jurist =England and the UK= Restraint of trade in England and the UK was and is defined as a legal contract between a buyer and a seller of a business, or between an employer and employee, that prevents the seller or employee from engaging in a similar business within a specified geographical area and within a specified period. It intends to protect trade secrets or proprietary information but is enforceable only if it is reasonable with reference to the party against whom it is made and if it is not contrary to public policy. The restraint of trade doctrine is based on the two concepts of prohibiting agreements that run counter to public policy, unless the reasonableness of an agreement could be shown. A restraint of trade is simply some kind of agreed provision that is designed to restrain another's trade. For example, in Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co a Swedish arms inventor promised on sale of his business to an American gun maker that he \\"would not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world, and would not compete with Maxim in any way.\\" To be a valid restraint of trade in the first place, both parties must have provided valuable consideration for their agreement to be enforceable. In Dyer's Case(1414) 2 Hen. 5, 5 Pl. 26 a dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return. On hearing the plaintiff's attempt to enforce this restraint, Hull J exclaimed, \\"per Dieu, if the plaintiff were here, he should go to prison till he had paid a fine to the King.\\" The common law evolved with changing business conditions. So in the early 17th century case of Rogers v ParryRogers v Parry (1613) 2 Bulstr 136 it was held that a promise by a joiner not to trade from his house for 21 years was enforceable against him since the time and place was certain. It was also held (by Chief Justice Coke) that a man cannot bind himself to not use his trade generally. This was followed in Broad v JolyffeBroad v Jolyffe (1620) Cro Jac 596 and Mitchel v ReynoldsMitchel v. Reynolds, 1 P Wms 181, 24 ER 347 (QB). where Lord Macclesfield asked, \\"What does it signify to a tradesman in London what another does in Newcastle?\\" In times of such slow communications and commerce around the country it seemed axiomatic that a general restraint served no legitimate purpose for one's business and ought to be void. But already in 1880 in Roussillon v RoussillonRoussillon v Roussillon (1880) 14 Ch.D. 351 Lord Justice Fry stated that a restraint unlimited in space need not be void, since the real question was whether it went further than necessary for the promisee's protection. So in the Nordenfelt case Lord Macnaghten ruled that while one could validly promise to \\"not make guns or ammunition anywhere in the world\\" it was an unreasonable restraint to \\"not compete with Maxim in any way.\\" This approach in England was confirmed by the House of Lords in Mason v The Provident Supply and Clothing Co.Mason v The Provident Supply and Clothing Co. [1913] AC 724 =United States= In the US, the first significant discussion occurred in the Sixth Circuit's opinion by Chief Judge (later US President and still later Supreme Court Chief Justice) William Howard Taft in United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co.85 F. 271 (1898), aff'd, 175 U.S. 211 (1899). Judge Taft explained the Sherman Antitrust Act of 189015 U.S.C. ¬ß 1. as a statutory codification of the English common-law doctrine of restraint of trade, as explicated in such cases as Mitchel v Reynolds.1 P Wms 181, 24 ER 347 (QB 1711). The court distinguished between naked restraints of trade and those ancillary to the legitimate main purpose of a lawful contract and reasonably necessary to effectuation of that purpose.This distinction has been described as \\"central to modern antitrust.\\" 28 (1978). Bork characterizes Judge Taft's opinion in Addyston Pipe \\"as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, antitrust opinions in the history of the law.\\" 'Id'. at 26. An example of the latter would be a non-competition clause associated with the lease or sale of a bakeshop, as in the Mitchel case. Such a contract should be tested by a \\"rule of reason,\\" meaning that it should be deemed legitimate if \\"necessary and ancillary.\\" An example of the naked type of restraint would be the price-fixing and bid-allocation agreements involved in the Addyston case. Taft said that \\"we do not think there is any question of reasonableness open to the courts to such a contract.\\" The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. During the following century, the Addyston Pipe opinion of Judge Taft has remained foundational in antitrust analysis.See Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 737-39 (1988) (dissenting opinion of Justice Stevens: \\"Although Judge Taft was writing as a Circuit Judge, his opinion is universally accepted as authoritative.\\"). The 1911 decision of the Supreme Court in Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States221 U.S. 1 (1911). relied on Taft's rule-of-reason analysis. In that case, the Court concluded that a contract offended the Sherman Act only if the contract restrained trade \\"unduly\\"‚Äîthat is, if the contract resulted in monopolistic consequences. A broader meaning, the Court suggested, would ban normal and usual contracts, and would thus infringe liberty of contract. The Court therefore endorsed the rule of reason enunciated in Addyston Pipe, which in turn derived from Mitchel v Reynolds and the common law of restraints of trade. In more recent cases, court continue to base their rulings on the Mitchel framework, but attention has turned to such issues as \\"necessary to do what?\\" and \\"how necessary compared to collateral damage?\\" For example, even if a restraint is necessary and ancillary, within the meaning of the Mitchel and Addyston Pipe cases, it may still be an unreasonable restraint of trade if its anticompetive effects and consequent harm to the public interest outweigh its benefits. Thus, Judge Ginsburg opined in the Polygram case: > If the only way a new product can be profitably introduced is to restrain > the legitimate competition of older products, then one must seriously wonder > whether consumers are genuinely benefited by the new product.PolyGram > Holding, Inc. v. FTC, 416 F.3d 29, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2005). A related issue is whether, even if a restraint is necessary and ancillary, available means exist to accomplish the desired result which are less harmful. The FTC-DOJ 2000 Guidelines for Collaborations among Competitors say that, in determining whether a restraint is \\"reasonably necessary,\\" the issue is \\"whether practical, significantly less restrictive means were reasonably available when the agreement was entered into.\\"Guidelines ¬ß 3.2. In other cases, questions have been raised as to whether the restraint was necessary and ancillary to accomplishing only something unworthy of recognition, given the resulting harm involved. In one recent case, a court rejected a credit card issuer's attempted justification of a restriction against competitive dealings said to be reasonably necessary to promote \\"loyalty\\" and \\"cohesion.\\"United States v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 163 F. Supp. 2d 322 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), aff'd, 344 F.3d 229 (2d Cir. 2003). How necessary and necessary to what thus remain controverted issues under the doctrine of Mitchel v. Reynolds. Restraining workers Under English law, restraining clauses in employment contracts are enforceable if: *There is a legitimate interest which needs to be protected. Examples of such interests include business connections and business secrets. *The restraint is reasonable, i.e. sufficiently protects the interest and goes no further. Generally, if a restraining clause is found to be unreasonable, then it will be void. In certain circumstances though the court may uphold it either by construing ambiguities or by severance. Severance consists of the application of what is known as the \\"blue pencil test\\"; if individual words which make the clause excessively wide are able to be crossed out and the clause still makes grammatical sense, without altering the nature of the obligations, then the courts may be willing to sever the illegal aspects of the clause and enforce the remainder. Contemporary application Though the restraint of trade doctrine is still valid, the current use has been limited by modern and economically oriented statutes of competition law in most countries. It remains of considerable importance in the United States as does the Mitchel v Reynolds case.

It was the regional formation of the Army in the South East of England-the Brigade commanded and administered soldiers throughout Kent, Surrey and Sussex-but also Brunei. In December 2014 the Brigade merged with 145 (South) Brigade to form Headquarters 11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East. Early history Following the end of the Second Boer War in 1902 the army was restructured, and the 2nd Infantry Brigade was established as part of the 1st Division in the 1st Army Corps, stationed at Aldershot Garrison. First World War Prince Arthur, the Duke of Connaught, inspecting troops of the 1st Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment, 2nd Brigade. Near Bruay, 1 July 1918. The brigade served with the 1st Division during World War I, from 1914 to 1918 and served throughout the war on the Western Front as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The brigade fought in many of the major battles of the war, first fighting at Mons where they were forced to retreat, and later the First Battle of Ypres, the Second Battle of Ypres and later the Battle of the Somme and Battle of Passchendaele, the Spring Offensive and the Hundred Days Offensive. =Order of Battle= The 2nd Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 2nd Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment * 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) (left February 1918) * 1st Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment * 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps * 1/5th (Cinque Ports) Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment (from February to August 1915) * 1/9th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (from March to November 1915) * 1/5th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) (from October 1915 until January 1916) * 2nd Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 26 January 1916, moved to 1st Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 28 February 1918) * 2nd Trench Mortar Battery (formed 27 November 1915) Second World War Troops from the 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) leap from their Bren gun carriers while training at Bourghelles, 21 March 1940. During the Second World War the 2nd Infantry Brigade saw active service in many of the major campaigns that the British Army fought in, from France with the BEF to Tunisia in North Africa and finally Italy and saw some extremely hard fighting at the Battle of Anzio where, during a German counterattack, the brigade was surrounded and nearly destroyed. In April 1943, during the fighting in Tunisia, Lieutenant Willward Alexander Sandys-Clarke of the 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) was posthumously awarded the brigades' only Victoria Cross of the war. =Order of battle= The 2nd Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) * 2nd Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment * 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders (left 7 March 1940) * 2nd Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 3 September 1939, disbanded 28 December 1940) * 6th Battalion, Gordon Highlanders (from 7 March 1940) =Commanders= The following officers commanded 2nd Infantry Brigade during the war: * Brig. Charles Edward Hudson; 1938 - 1940 * Brig. Arthur Dowler; 1940 - 1941 * Brig. Eric Edward James Moore; 1941 - 1944 * Brig. Adrian Clements Gore; 1944 * Brig. Charles Edward Anson Firth; 1944 * Brig. Richard Neville Anderson; 1944 - 1945 Post-Second World War In the House of Commons on 25 November 2002 the Secretary of State for Defence said that \\"The Brigade (along with 52 Brigade) was being re-roled from a regional brigade headquarters to provide better command and control arrangements for light infantry role battalions, all of which are currently deployable. The reorganisation of the brigade will not result in an increase in the number of deployable troops. The change will bring greater coherence to the way that light role units prepare for operations, through improved co-ordination of training\\". Following broad reorganisation under the Future Army Structures, 2nd Infantry Brigade was renamed 2nd (South East) Brigade in 2007. The name was in line with its revised role as a Regional Brigade, responsible largely for Territorial Army units. The brigade became part of the United Kingdom's Support Command as the 2nd (South East) Brigade. It was not listed under the Army 2020 plan. In December 2014 the Brigade merged with 145 (South) Brigade to form Headquarters 11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East.

Quakers (or Friends) are members of a Christian religious movement that started in England in the 17th century, and has spread throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Some Quakers originally came to North America to spread their beliefs to the British colonists there, while others came to escape the persecution they experienced in Europe. The first known Quakers in North America arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1656 via Barbados, and were soon joined by other Quaker preachers who converted many colonists to Quakerism. Many Quakers settled in Rhode Island, due to its policy of religious freedom, as well as the British colony of Pennsylvania which was formed by William Penn in 1681 as a haven for persecuted Quakers.  The arrival of the Quakers  Mary Fisher and Ann Austin are the first known Quakers to set foot in the New World. They traveled from England to Barbados in 1655 and then went on to the Massachusetts Bay Colony to spread the beliefs of the Friends among the colonists. In Puritan-run Massachusetts five of the two women were persecuted, imprisoned, and their books were burned. Only one man, Nicholas Upsall, was kind to them during their imprisonment. Nicholas became a Friend himself and began spreading Friends' beliefs in Massachusetts. Due to the intolerance of the Puritans, the Quakers eventually left the Massachusetts bay colonies and migrated to the more tolerant colonies in Rhode Island.  The first Monthly Meeting  Nicholas Upsall was banished from Boston and took refuge in the town of Sandwich, Massachusetts. It was there that he helped to establish the first Monthly Meeting of Friends in the United States, which began meeting in 1657 at the home of William and Priscilla Allen. Besides the Allens and Upsall, those in attendance included Richard Kerley and Elizabeth Newland.  Quakers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania  The first Friends who settled along the Delaware River were John Fenwick, Edward Wade, John Wade, and Richard Noble. They formed a settlement at Salem, New Jersey, in 1675. In 1681, King Charles II allowed William Penn, a Quaker, a charter for the area that was to become Pennsylvania. Penn guaranteed the settlers of his colony freedom of religion. He advertised the policy across Europe so that Quakers and other religious dissidents would know that they could live there safely. On November 10, 1681, Robert Wade established the first Monthly Meeting in the colony at his home, which eventually became the Chester Monthly Meeting.  Quakers and abolitionism  Quakers were at the center of the movement to abolish slavery in the early United States; it is no coincidence that Pennsylvania, center of American Quakerism, was the first state to abolish slavery. In the antebellum period, \\"Quaker meeting houses [in Philadelphia] ...had sheltered abolitionists for generations.\\" Branches of Quakerism in North America  Quakers in North America are diverse in their beliefs and practices. Friends there have split into various groups because of disagreements throughout the years. Liberal Friends emphasize the Inner Light as a source of inspiration and guidance. They practice unprogrammed (i.e., spontaneous, Spirit-led) worship, and have no ordained clergy. Among them are both Christians and universalists. Many liberal Friends groups are part of the Friends General Conference. Some of them are part of both the Friends General Conference and the Friends United Meeting; others are independent or not affiliated with any larger group. They are very involved in service projects but not in evangelism. They are widespread throughout Canada and the United States but are concentrated in Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey. Pastoral Friends emphasize the Bible as a source of inspiration and guidance. They practice programmed (i.e., planned) worship led by ordained clergy. Most pastoral Friends groups are part of the Friends United Meeting. They conduct both service projects and evangelism, and are found primarily in Indiana, North Carolina, Iowa, and Ohio. Conservative Friends are a small group that emphasize both the Inner Light and the Bible as sources of inspiration and guidance. They practice unprogrammed worship. Many of them adhere to the traditional standards of \\"plainness\\" in speech and dress (see Testimony of Simplicity). Their meetings are not part of any larger groups. They are found primarily in Iowa, Ohio, and North Carolina. Evangelical Friends strongly emphasize the Bible as a source of inspiration and guidance, considering it the ultimate authority for faith and practice. They practice planned worship led by ordained clergy. Their congregations are often called churches instead of meetings, and they are usually part of Evangelical Friends International. They are very active in evangelism and missionary outreach as well as service projects. They are found throughout the United States and Latin America but are concentrated in Guatemala, Panama, Ohio, California, Oregon, and Kansas. The Religious Society of Free Quakers, originally called \\"The Religious Society of Friends, by some styled the Free Quakers\\", was established on February 20, 1781 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More commonly known as Free Quakers, the Society was founded by members of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, who had been expelled for failure to adhere to the Peace Testimony during the American Revolutionary War. Many of its early members were prominent Quakers involved in the American Revolution before the society was established. Notable Free Quakers at the early meetings include Lydia Darragh and Betsy Ross. Following the end of the American Revolutionary War, the number of Free Quakers began to dwindle as some members died and others were either accepted back into the Society of Friends or by other religious institutions. There is a small group of Free Quakers in Indiana who continue the tradition of the Five Principles (Inner Light, peace, simplicity, justice, stewardship) and the Five Freedoms (from creeds, from clergy, from public worship, from organized membership, from evangelization). Today, the descendants of the original Free Quakers hold an annual meeting of the Religious Society of Free Quakers at the Free Quaker Meetinghouse in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Participants usually meet in an urban center and make their way around the city streets and public spaces (or a series of taverns in the case of a zombie pub crawl) in an orderly fashion. Zombie walks can be organized simply for entertainment or with a purpose, such as setting a world record or promoting a charitable cause. Originating in North America during the 2000s, zombie walks have occurred throughout the world. Format Zombie walks are relatively common in large cities, especially in North America. Some have been established as annual traditions, though others are organized as spontaneous flash mob events or performance art. The complexity and purpose of zombie walks varies. As an advanced technique to heighten interest and realism, some zombie mobs will \\"eat\\" victims to create new zombies, in sight of onlookers. Some participants occasionally dress up as soldiers who are called in to contain the outbreak, or survivors who are trying to defend themselves from the onslaught of the zombie horde. Some events are staged as spoof political rallies organized \\"to raise awareness of zombie rights\\", with participants carrying placards. Some zombie walks have also been staged as \\"hunger marches\\" with the intent of raising awareness of world hunger and collecting items for food banks. A zombie wearing a 'mock' political shirt during a Zombie Walk in Toronto, 2011. History =Gencon 2000= The earliest zombie walk styled event on record was put together rather last-minute at the Gen Con gaming convention in Milwaukee in August 2000. The event was created to poke good-natured fun at the Vampire: The Masquerade LARPers that were taking over large portions of the convention, and disrupt their games. Michael Yates, Mark Stafford, Jacob Skowronek and several others organized the event with roughly 60 participants. The event was later recorded in the book 40 Years of Gencon with photos and recollections from the organizers. While it was rumored that the organizers were arrested and thrown out of the convention for their flash mob of zombies, they were simply questioned by security before being told to disband. =Annual Trash Film Orgy film festival= Another early zombie walk was held in Sacramento, California on August 19, 2001. The event, billed as \\"The Zombie Parade\\", was the idea of Bryna Lovig, who suggested it to the organizers of Trash Film Orgy as a way to promote their annual midnight film festival. It was held again on July 27, 2002, and has since become an annual event, drawing over 1,000 participants in 2012. The event was traditionally held as the kick off to the six-week film festival at Sacramento's historic Crest Theatre until 2014 when the theatre's general manager of 28 years, Laura \\"Sid\\" Garcia- Heberger, couldn't reach a lease renewal agreement with the building owners. Despite the film festival's change of venue, TFO continues the walk as part of a free all-ages event, the \\"Carnival of the Dead\\", which includes food trucks from local vendors, make up stations, live bands, contests, games, and a projected movie in the park at the end of the night. The streets in downtown Sacramento comprising the walk's route are shut down by the city in order to safely accommodate the large numbers of participants. =Toronto and Sherbrooke walk= The first gathering specifically billed as a \\"Zombie Walk\\" occurred in October 2003 in Toronto, organized by local horror movie fan Thea Munster and with only seven participants. A \\"zombie demonstration\\" occurred in Sherbrooke, Quebec, on November 1, 2003, organized by a local grassroots organization, with 60 participants walking on a one kilometer course downtown. Another zombie march was organized the next year by the same group in Sherbrooke, with nearly 200 participants. In subsequent years, the Toronto Zombie Walk has grown tremendously in size, with the 2014 event playing host to more than 15,000 participants. The Zombie Walk has spread to Vancouver, creating the zombie walk tradition in that city. On August 27, 2005, over 400 participants proceeded through Vancouver's Pacific Centre mall, travelled on the SkyTrain (referred to for the event as the \\"SkyBrain\\" or the \\"BrainTrain\\"), and continued 35 blocks to Mountain View Cemetery. =Gaining popularity= The mid to late 2000s saw an exponential gain in popularity for zombie walks, due largely to the success of zombie films at the time, such as the Resident Evil movies, 28 Days Later, Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, George A. Romero's Land of the Dead, and Zombieland. Documentation of zombie walks consequently began to appear more often in mainstream news media and blogs. Zombie walks soon spread across North America and to cities around the globe, such as Mar del Plata, Argentina. Rio de Janeiro had its first zombie walk on November 2, 2007 (Day of the Dead) and the event has become annual since then. On October 29, 2006, nearly 900 \\"zombie walkers\\" gathered at the Monroeville Mall outside of Pittsburgh, which served as the set of George A. Romero's classic zombie film Dawn of the Dead, to participate in Pittsburgh's first annual Walk of the Dead.Donaldson, Bob, and Roberts, Larry. A walk with zombies (Online multimedia presentation.) Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. October 30, 2006. In addition to setting a Guinness World Record, the event was a benefit for the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Pittsburgh's zombie walk has since grown into an annual horror festival called Zombie Fest and organized by The It's Alive Show, a local Pittsburgh late night horror and science fiction television program. The Pittsburgh festival plays host to the annual Walk of the Dead as well as a zombie ball, costume contest, concerts, and celebrity guest appearances, and also serves as the headquarters of The It's Alive Show's World Zombie Day, a world hunger charity event. Zombie walks are also a regular occurrence at ZomBcon, \\"the world's first zombie convention\\" which takes place every October in Seattle. Apart from zombie walks, ZomBcon also features panel discussions with zombie authors, actors and artists, workshops, film screenings, and other activities for zombie fans. ZomBcon also organizes Seattle's annual Red, White and Dead zombie walk every July. =World records= Official Monroeville Mall world record attempt photo in 2006 The first zombie walk world record was set on October 29, 2006 at Monroeville Mall outside of Pittsburgh, during the city's first annual Walk of the Dead. Guinness World Records certified that 894 people participated in the walk. The second zombie walk at Monroeville Mall during the 2007 Zombie Fest was also verified by Guinness World Records as the largest gathering of zombies to date, with 1,028 participants. The 2007 Toronto Zombie Walk drew a crowd of over 1,100 zombies, a number confirmed by Toronto Police Services. At the time, this was the largest zombie walk on record. A zombie march in Brisbane on May 25, 2008 set an unofficial record of over 1,500 participants, according to media reports. On June 21, 2008, a zombie march took place in Chicago with over 1,550 zombies estimated, setting a new unofficial record. Nottingham Zombie Walk in 2008 On October 31, 2008, a zombie walk took place in the Old Market Square of Nottingham, England, with 1,227 attendees. The event was organized by GameCity, and the zombies did dances to zombie-related songs such as \\"Thriller\\", \\"Disturbia\\", and \\"Ghostbusters\\", and featured a performance from American singer Jonathan Coulton. The event achieved a new official Guinness World Record for largest zombie walk. In June 2009, Pittsburgh zombie fans won back the Guinness World Record after Guinness verified that the Zombie Fest 'Walk of the Dead' at Monroeville Mall on October 26, 2008, had 1,341 participating walkers. On July 3, 2009, a zombie walk organized by Fremont Outdoor Movies in Seattle beat all previous zombie walk records. Guinness World Records officially recorded 3,894 zombies at the Red, White and Dead zombie event, though local news claimed 4277 participants. In October 2009, Guinness World Records officially recorded and approved a new record for the largest gathering of zombies. The record was set at the Big Chill Festival in Ledbury, England, on August 6, 2009. There were 4,026 zombie mob participants. On October 25, 2009, the biggest recorded gathering of zombies in the Southern Hemisphere occurred in Brisbane, with over 5,000 participants reportedly in attendance as reported by the Queensland Police. The walk was also a charity event helping to raise awareness and money for the Brain Foundation of Australia. On October 30, 2009, zombie walkers in Grand Rapids, Michigan attempted a second run at the zombie mob world record. An estimated 8,000 participants braved rainy weather to gather in Calder Plaza outside of Grand Rapids's City and County buildings. The event was coordinated by Rob Bliss, organizer of Grand Rapids's first zombie walk. Volunteers collected signatures from the crowd, though the record is currently unverified by Guinness. Organizers of the fifth annual Denver Zombie Crawl in Denver counted more than 7,300 zombie walkers in the event. This is considered to be a low figure, as up to one third of the total participants did not walk through the counter. The crawl took place on October 23, 2010, in downtown Denver at the 16th Street Mall. On October 24, 2010, a reported 10,000-strong zombie walk took place in Brisbane. As with previous years, the event raised money for the Brain Foundation of Australia. New Jersey Zombie Walk in 2010 Guinness officially recognized a new record for the world's largest gathering of zombies on October 30, 2010, at the third annual New Jersey Zombie Walk on the Asbury Park Boardwalk in Asbury Park. Guinness recorded 4,093 zombies at the event, though organizers, police, and fire officials estimate more than 5,000 zombies were in attendance. In July 2011, more cities would attempt to break this world record. On July 2, 2011, Seattle attempted to take back the record at the 3rd annual Fremont Red, White and Dead Zombie Walk hosted by Fremont Outdoor Movies. The zombie count according to Fremont organizers was 4,522 in attendance with estimations of over 4,800‚Äì5,000 after the official stop point for counting zombies. Representatives from Guinness did not attend the event. On July 23, 2011, the Dublin Zombie Walk in Dublin had an estimated 8,000 zombies in attendance, but confirmation is still pending from Guinness World Records. October 2011 also saw multiple attempts to break the New Jersey world record. Over 7,000 zombies are believed to have attended the 9th Annual Toronto Zombie Walk on October 22. Both the annual Denver Zombie Crawl on October 22 and the annual Brisbane Zombie Walk on October 23 claim to have had over 12,000 zombie participants. On October 29, the city of Long Beach, California, set out to break the world record as part of its fourth annual zombie walk, produced by community organizations Long Beach Cinematheque and Mondo Celluloid, and partnered with Michael Jackson-inspired flash mob \\"Thrill the World\\", who set out to break a world record of their own with the world's biggest \\"Thriller\\" flash mob. By night's end, an estimated 14,000 participants had taken over the entirety of the downtown area, breaking local business sales records and all but shutting down traffic for hours. In November 2011, Mexico City counted 9,806 for their large zombie gathering. The zombie walk of October 20, 2012 in Santiago, Chile had more than 12,000 zombies walking in the city, though no Guinness record was broken. On October 28, 2012, Buenos Aires gathered 25,000 zombies. The zombie walk occurring November 2012, in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul) holds the current world record for zombie gathering, recognized by Guinness at a count of 8,027 at Midway Stadium in Saint Paul on October 13, 2012. Estimates of the entire Twin Cities crawl put the zombie event upwards of 30,000 zombie participates, surpassing any other gathering of its kind, official or not. In 2013, the Asbury Park event reclaimed the world record with 9,592 zombies. In October 19, 2013 an estimated 15,000 Chileans took to the streets of Santiago to take part in the city's fourth annual Zombie Walk. The zombies limped two kilometres along the Alameda, one of the main thoroughfares in the Chilean capital. South Brazil The Zombie Walk, annually held in Curitiba, South Brazil, it's known to bear 25,000 to 30,000 zombies and people. Held during the Brazilian Carnival holidays, Curitiba is known to be not much fond of the famous Brazilian festivity preferring instead to host the Psycho Carnival rock festival in which the Zombie Walk was derived off. Many people from states who also do not like samba or the carnival associated acts go to Curitiba for the Zombie Walk and rock festivals around the city. Charity events Charity work continues to be a common component of zombie walks across the planet. Community service organizations such as Zombie Squad have used zombie walks as demonstrations to raise funds and awareness for local and global issues, such as world hunger. Both world record walks at Pittsburgh's Zombie Fest have included food drives. In 2008, The It's Alive Show initiated World Zombie Day. The It's Alive Show encouraged cities all over the globe to celebrate World Zombie Day by holding zombie walks to raise awareness of global hunger. The first World Zombie Day took place October 26, 2008, the same day as Pittsburgh's Zombie Fest, when more than 30 cities worldwide took part. Food drives for local hunger-related charities took place at each participating city's zombie walk. Pittsburgh's walk alone brought in more than one ton of food to benefit the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. The second World Zombie Day took place October 11, 2009, with even more participation from cities all over the world. October 21, 2012 saw over 12,000 participants march through the city of Brisbane. With a new music festival format added to the event, Brisbane Zombie Walk raised $55,000 for the Brain Foundation of Australia, making them the most successful zombie charity event in the world. In 2011, the Brisbane Zombie Walk made over $25,000 for the Brain Foundation. Pub crawl variant Copenhagen Zombie Crawl 2011 ‚Äì held on June 1 (the night before Ascension Day) Some zombie walks incorporate pub crawling, during which participants visit multiple bars over the course of the walk. The first large-scale zombie pub crawl was held in Minneapolis on October 15, 2005. The crawl consisted of roughly 150 participants in zombie costumes moving from bar to bar in the city's Northeast district. The Minneapolis \\"Zombie Pub Crawl\\" has since become an annual event and attendance has grown exponentially. It has been held in Downtown Minneapolis since 2015.Horgen, Tom.Nightlife: 'Dead' ahead Star Tribune. October 16, 2008. Similar large-scale zombie-themed pub crawls have developed in New Orleans, Providence, Rhode Island, Reno, Houston, Eau Claire, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Philadelphia's zombie pub crawl is held on Easter Sunday in celebration of Jesus, \\"the world's most famous zombie\\". Zombie pub crawls are now a regular occurrence in cities all over the world. The New York City Zombie Crawl has involved attendees walk all over Manhattan and drink at different pubs. In 2007, the Viking Hats group organized a Halloween zombie walk in London that ended at the Tate London. London's Zombie Pub Crawl has become an annual Halloween weekend event. In 2007, zombies used bicycles to travel around town in the initial Ride of the Living Dead event in Kenosha, Wisconsin. An offshoot of the non-zombie summer Handlebars and Bars bicycle pub crawl, this event began with about 40 riders in its debut, and has since grown exponentially. In 2014, the event attracted over 400 zombie bicyclists and featured indie-rock bands from the Milwaukee-Chicago corridor as entertainment throughout the day.Handlebars and BarsRide of the Living Dead  Facebook Incidents In 2006, a young woman in Bloomington, Indiana reported to police that a group of \\"zombies\\" attacked her car by covering the vehicle in \\"purple goo\\"; the zombies in question turned out to be participants in a small, local zombie walk, and several arrests were made. At the 2006 Vancouver Zombie Walk, an incident occurred in which two impatient drivers attempted to drive their cars through a crowd of zombies headed down Robson Street: this resulted in some severe injuries among the zombies, but no damage to the vehicles. Another incident involved a pair of zombies using a brick to shatter the window of a man's car; both zombies were arrested. In 2010, the annual Zombie Shuffle in Melbourne saw the largest attendance in its five-year history, but some locals complained of the mess that the zombie \\"gore\\" left behind, as well as the walk's disruption of a play for preschoolers. In 2011 and 2012, participants in the Minneapolis Zombie Pub Crawl broke store windows and caused other damage to the area in which the event was held. Many residents see the event as disruptive to the life of the neighborhood. In 2012, a Russian zombie walk in support of Pussy Riot in Omsk, Siberia was banned by the local government. In October 2015, a shooting occurred at the ZombiCon in Fort Myers, Florida. 1 person was killed and 5 others were wounded. Lawsuits led to cancellation of the event the next year.

Both Eriksson and Harlin are sound engineers and producers for Techno Squirrels. Their music has been used in MTV's The Real World (Sydney), The Real World (Hollywood), The Real World vs. Road Rules Challenge, Regenesis (Sci Fi Channel), and on LucasArts' Thrillville 2 soundtrack. Their debut album, Plastic Makes it Possible, was released in August 2007 with two singles (Love Comes First, and Unbelievable). In September 2007, Love Comes First began getting regular rotation on Sirius Satellite Radio and by October of that year it had reached the number one spot on Channel 35's Top 40. Shortly after Sirius, KCRW's Nic Harcourt picked up another cut off the album, \\"South of Colorado,\\" to play on his nationally syndicated shows \\"Sounds Eclectic\\" and \\"Morning Becomes Eclectic.\\" On February 19, 2008 Om Records released their Chill Compilation, volume 2, featuring Techno Squirrels' \\"Love Comes First\\" track as track 1 on the CD. A remix of the track \\"Love Comes First (StyrofoamKid Remix) was recently included on the Cream Ibiza Paul Van Dyk Compilation of 2008. Style Techno Squirrels' music forms a blending of styles spanning various types of pop and electronic music. Classified as pop, electronica, trance, house, progressive-house, or techno by different music reviewers and critics most people identify Techno Squirrels' sound by its cohesive similarity to itself more than its comparison to other artists. Techno Squirrels' style walks a line between club-destined floor-thumping techno and more sensitive pop productions. Not often ones to settle for a single vocal sample to carry an electronic track, Techno Squirrels are more known for their pop structures (verses, choruses, bridges, etc.) laid over danceable foundations of \\"4-on-the-floor\\" beats and bass lines. They do also, however, depart more dramatically from dance music into electronica tracks closer in nature to artists like the Postal Service, Telepopmusik, or Frou Frou. Background Eriksson, no stranger to electronic and experimental music founded the underground band Schulte/Eriksson (Org Records), who's discordant and poly-rhythmic pop songs caught the ears of legendary BBC DJ John Peel in the late 90s. Around the same time, Eriksson joined with Daniel Hunt and Reuben Wu to sing for their recently formed electropop group, Ladytron. Eriksson recorded their breakthrough single with them, \\"He Took Her to a Movie\\", which ended up on their full length LP after Eriksson's departure from the group (as listed on the 2004 reissue of \\"604\\" by Rykodisc). Ryan Harlin was a filmmaker and recording engineer prior to his involvement with Techno Squirrels. His film work, still actively in production, documents the musical careers of early and influential punk rock bands like the Bouncing Souls, Youth Brigade, and NOFX. Harlin also ran NovaSound, a recording studio in Philadelphia, USA from 1996-2000. Techno Squirrels formed in 2005 in Los Angeles, California. However the two first worked together during a Schulte/Eriksson recording session at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA) - a higher education institution in Liverpool, England whose graduates from that time in the late 90s include, in addition to Harlin and Eriksson, fellow electronic artist Kate Havnevik, record producer Sean McGhee, and Sandi Thom. Ryan Harlin has admitted in several interviews to his early resistance to electronic music and credits record producer and friend Sean McGhee with changing his opinion of the genre. For Lisa Eriksson, it was a trip to the European music festival, Roskilde, which would first expose her to the sounds of early influential artists like Fluke and Underworld. Around the same time, but separate from each other, Harlin and Eriksson were both beginning to experiment with electronic music production. While Lisa Eriksson was beginning to add vintage analog synthesizers and samplers into her work with Schulte/Eriksson, Ryan Harlin was beginning to incorporate electronic elements into his music production and engineering work, even producing two early tracks with Kate Havnevik along with LIPA classmate Duncan Speakman. In 2005, Ryan Harlin and Lisa Eriksson began collaborating musically - passing song ideas back and forth while Eriksson was attaining a master's degree in audio production from the University of Westminster, London, England. Later the two both ended up in Los Angeles, California, Harlin producing films with Emo Riot Productions and Eriksson working in radio production. By the middle of 2005 the two began production on what would become their debut single, \\"Mute\\", released by Rave Police Records in fall 2005. In 2006, their remix of \\"Om Mani\\" showed up in repeated rotation on BBC1's Asian Network program. In April 2007 \\"Om Mani\\" was also featured in an episode of Regenesis, a Canadian Sci-Fi television drama (season 3 episode 6).

James Backhouse (8 July 1794 ‚Äì 20 January 1869) was a botanist and missionary for the Quaker church in Australia. His son, also James Backhouse (1825‚Äì1890), was also a botanist.Ray Desmond: Dictionary Of British And Irish Botanists And Horticulturists. Talyor & Francis, 1994, , p. 31. Early life in England James Backhouse was born in 1794, the fourth child of James and Mary Backhouse a Quaker business family of Darlington, County Durham, England. He was the third after his father and grandfather to be called James Backhouse. His grandfather died as a Quaker prisoner and martyr at Lancaster Castle in 1697. His father, James, (together with his father and brother), founded the Backhouse's Bank in Darlington. His mother was Mary Dearman of Thorne, Yorkshire, also a devout Quaker. His father died when he was a child and his mother brought him up in a religious atmosphere. He was educated in Leeds and began work in a grocery, drug and chemical business, but he developed tuberculosis and became too delicate to pursue a sedentary occupation. Coming from a family of botanists, he was encouraged to spend time in the open air and study botany. An uncle helped him in this and he made botanical trips to Upper Teesdale with the Durham lead miner, John Binks (1766‚Äì1817) who is credited with the discovery of many of the area's rare plants. Binks was a major influence, as was the Newcastle botanist, Nathaniel John Winch, and William Jackson Hooker (1785‚Äì1865). James then spent two years near Norwich learning the nursery trade, and where he first conceived of 'a gospel errand into Australia' believing strongly that this was the will of God. In 1815 Backhouse moved to York, where he and his brother Thomas purchased the York nursery business of John and George Telford in Toft Green, which had been in existence for 150 years. By 1821 the business was flourishing with 37 varieties of vines, 31 of strawberries, 170 gooseberries, 129 roses and 125 apple trees. In 1822 Backhouse married Deborah Lowe, and in 1824 he was admitted as a minister in the Religious Society of Friends. As a dedicated Quaker and clerk of York monthly meeting from 1825, he travelled in the ministry from that year. His commitment and evangelising were central to his life. He addressed a crowd at York racecourse, which his sister Sarah put at two thousand, on 'the iniquity of the frivolities in which they were engaged, and to call their attention to the weightier concerns of eternity' (York Courant, 9 August 1825). In December 1827, the wives of both brothers died, James being left with a son and a daughter. Australia In September 1831, Backhouse sailed for Australia on a mission to the convicts and settlers. In this venture he had the support of the monthly meeting and of his brother, Thomas, also a devout Quaker, who believed evangelising took precedence over business, and who therefore looked after the business on his behalf. The initial journey took five months. His Quaker ministry, assisted by his companion and secretary, George Washington Walker (1800‚Äì1859), began immediately with the crew which was prone to drunkenness and violence. The missionaries arrived at Hobart in February 1832, and they spent the next six years journeying all over the then settled districts of Tasmania, New South Wales, and as far north as the site of Brisbane. They visited Port Phillip in 1837, and the states of South Australia and Western Australia just before they left. They visited penal settlements working for and interceding for prisoners, and deeply concerned by the cruelty and rigours they found. They wrote to Elizabeth Fry about the condition of women prisoners on ships and to the Governor of Van Diemen's Land on the prisons. Death of prisoners was often by murder from other prisoners in appalling conditions. Backhouse and Walker issued a lengthy address to the prison population of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land pleading for prisoners to find salvation in religion. They were tireless campaigners for temperance and thrift. A third of wages paid in spirits was mentioned at a temperance meeting in Perth and they felt 'the prevailing immorality' was fuelled by drink. They also looked at the policy towards Aborigines 'this injured race of our fellow men'. Alongside their work with prisons they set up and visited Quaker meeting houses. South Africa Backhouse and Walker then went to Mauritius and South Africa and continued their missionary work, preaching whenever a few people could be gathered together to hear them. In South Africa they also visited prisons including Robben Island and in more than 19 months and 6000 miles on wagon and horseback he learnt languages including Afrikaans so he could speak to the local populations, attended Quaker meetings, temperance meetings and non-Quaker meetings, and set up a multi-racial school for the poor in Cape Town with money sent by English Friends. On his travels, James Backhouse also collected plants and seeds which he sent back to the York nursery, to Kew Gardens, and to Professor William Hooker, Professor of Botany at Glasgow. His works published on his return, \\"A narrative visit to the Australian colonies\\" (1843) and \\"A narrative visit to the Mauritius and South Africa\\" (1844) are detailed accounts of his travels with engravings from his original sketches of indigenous vegetation, aborigines, chain gangs of prisoners, and numerous missionary stations, with appendices of letters sent to officials, Christian evangelical writings and speeches. England Backhouse returned to England and arrived at London on 15 February 1841. In York, his safe return was greeted fervently by the York Quarterly and Monthly Meetings. The nursery had flourished in his absence but with the coming of the railway had had to move from Toft Green to Fishergate. When his brother died in 1845, he brought his own son James into the business, and with him supervised the move in 1853 to a 100-acre site, greater than Kew, at Holgate. The most striking feature was a rock (alpine) garden, 40 glasshouses, underground fernery and plants from all over the world. He maintained detailed involvement in the family finance, in wills and in the business but he also continued his evangelical work making many visits around the country, including to Dublin. He gave talks to workers at York Glass works in 1858 and also to the rail wagon works. He was involved in Quaker schools at Bootham and Ackworth and gave financial as well as spiritual help for a reading room at a nonconformist chapel in Upper Teesdale. He visited Norway in 1851, 1853 and 1860, holding more than 200 meetings in 1853 and 1860. In 1862 he held over 40 meetings throughout Great Britain and in 1865, aged over 70, there were 53 public meetings at which he exhorted Friends to turn against pomp and parade, the lures of honorific office, elegant or ornamental clothing and using heathen names of days and months. Backhouse maintained his evangelical work all his life, travelling and preaching much in England, Scotland and Ireland. Among his published works, Backhouse wrote or edited \\"A memoir of Deborah Backhouse of York\\" (1828), \\"Memoirs of Francis Howgill\\" (1828), \\"Extracts from the Letters of James Backhouse\\" (1838‚Äì41), \\"The life and correspondence of William and Alice Ellis\\" (1849), \\"A short record of the life and experiences of Thomas Bulman\\" (1851), and numerous sermons, addresses and tracts. With Charles Tylor he wrote \\"The life and labours of George Washington Walker\\" (1862). His son, James Backhouse, was the author of A handbook of European birds (1890) and other publications. James Backhouse was honoured by having the plant genus Backhousia named after him. In 2017 a commemorative plaque was unveiled at 92 Micklegate, York, once the home of the Backhouse brothers, and now of the York Conservation Trust. This was the result of a collaboration between the York Civic Trust, The York Conservation Trust, and the Yorkshire Gardens Trust.

And although this expertise was widely acknowledged, he was also a voice crying in the wilderness, for he sought to herald a gospel greater than he to a body of modern Quakers with little taste for it. His appreciation of his situation is beautifully captured in a 1954 letter to his sister-in-law, which he wrote to decline her invitation to join an intentional community (The Bruderhof ) associated with a non-Quaker sect. He wrote, in part: Life Lewis Benson was born in 1906 in his grandmother's house in Sea Girt, New Jersey.Finding Aid for the LEWIS BENSON PAPERS, 1932-1986, Haverford College Library, February 2009.

He grew up in Weehawken, New Jersey, across the river from New York City. Most of the year, he attended a Scotch Presbyterian Church where his mother taught Sunday school. Each summer, he went to the shore and attended Manasquan Meeting, and First Day School there. He also regularly attended New York Yearly Meeting and the Half Yearly Meeting Manasquan belonged to. At 16, he dropped out of school and became a messenger boy for the Pennsylvania Railroad. Soon after, he came under the influence of George Gurdjieff, a fellow who claimed to have studied in Tibet and have secret knowledge that would allow one to become \\"an autonomous person\\" and get others to do what one wanted. Benson made that man's teaching the center of his inner life, but after seven years in the movement, he became disillusioned. He felt Gurdjieff's teachings were soulless, and he left abruptly. For several years, his life had little direction or hope. He and his mother moved to Manasquan. Borrowing money from relatives, he opened a Studebaker agency, but it during the Great Depression, the business quickly failed. Broke and faithless, Benson despaired and planned to do away with himself. He got in his car and drove as far west as Arizona, but returned home instead of killing himself. Back in Manasquan Meeting, someone at the meeting asked Lewis to go through the old books in their library, to see if any were worth keeping. Being an old meeting, they had an excellent collection of works by early Friends. Reading the Journal of George Fox, Benson learned of Fox's own despair, and his rescue from it through the voice of the Lord. Benson set out to find that experience of rescue himself. He read all the Quaker classics, and began a lifelong collection of detailed notes about them. Benson spent 1933-34 at Pendle Hill, continuing his study of the early Quakers. The following summer, he moved to Shrewsbury, NJ, and helped restart the meeting there that had been laid down in his youth. He then spent a year at Woodbrooke, in England, studying modern Quaker authors, concluding that their connection with the early Quakers was tenuous at best. Others there were excited about what he had found, and urged him to stay another year to write up his results. He didn't, because he felt that would be primarily an academic exercise‚Äîhe was seeking a more evangelical role. Returning to the United States, Benson was invited to be the first librarian at Pendle Hill, to build up a library there, so people wouldn't have to go the Swarthmore or Haverford College libraries. In the summer of 1938, Benson went to Evanston, Illinois, to become the pastoral secretary of a new meeting there. He spent four years there, living and sharing the faith he had rediscovered. Benson had found his mission. For the rest of his life, he worked to deepen his understanding of the message of George Fox, and to share it through writing and speaking. He supported his family by working as a printer. Over the years, he spoke numerous times at prominent Quaker institutions such as Pendle Hill, and Haverford College. His major work, Catholic Quakerism (now republished as 'A Universal Christian Faith')Benson, L: A Universal Christian Faith, New Foundation Fellowship, 2007. based on a series of lectures given at Woodbrooke in the 1960s, was published by Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. The last ten years of his life, he traveled and spoke extensively throughout Britain, Ireland, the United States, Canada, and Japan. Lewis Benson died of leukemia at his home on the Jersey shore in 1986. His library and papers now reside in a special collection at Haverford College Library, but his legacy goes much beyond that. A number of well-known friends have publicly acknowledged the debt they owe Benson. Wilmer Cooper, Founding Dean of the Earlham School of Religion, said: T. Canby Jones, onetime Professor of Religion and Philosophy at Wilmington College, and author of George Fox's Attitude Toward War and \\"The Power of the Lord Is Over All\\": The Pastoral Letters of George Fox, said, Dean Freiday, editor of Quaker Religious Thought, author of Nothing Without Christ, and editor of Barclay's Apology in Modern English said Finally, John Punshon, a Tutor at Woodbrooke College and author of Encounter With Silence, Portrait in Grey, and Reasons for Hope, noted, The New Foundation Fellowship groups in Britain and the United States are also part of Benson's legacy. They formed in the mid-1970s following lecture series of Benson's, and take their name from one of his talks. These groups have reprinted all of George Fox's published writings, have re- instituted the traveling ministry of the early Quakers, and keep many of Benson's writings in print.

The term also applies to the rivalries between a country‚Äôs intelligence services (e.g. CIA and FBI in the United States), or between the police and fire services of a city, such as the NYPD and FDNY. Overview Interservice rivalry can occur over such topics as the appropriation of the military budget, prestige or the possession of certain types of weapons. The latter case can arise, for example, when the navy operates an aircraft carrier, which may be viewed by the air force as an infringement of its traditional responsibilities. Another case was the dispute between the Indian Army and Indian Air Force, which erupted when these two branches fought over the ownership of AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters in 2012.IAF, not Army, will get Apache attack helicopters: Govt - Times Of India Cases =Germany= Many military analysts consider the Wehrmacht, Nazi Germany's armed forces, pioneers of \\"jointness\\" (integrierter Kriegf√ºhrung, in German). They point out that Blitzkrieg, the war-fighting style that brought the Wehrmacht stunning victories between 1939 and 1941, depended upon the close integration of ground and air (and sometimes naval) forces and that even after the Blitzkrieg campaigns gave way to a drawn-out war of attrition, the Wehrmacht routinely conducted operations in a way that would today be called \\"joint\\". That is, elements of two or more services participated in close cooperation with mutually agreed goals, relatively little inter-service rivalry, and a command structure that, at least at the \\"sharp end\\" of operations, promoted, rather than inhibited, a spirit of jointness. Consequently, the analysts assert, the Wehrmacht enhanced its capabilities and improved its combat effectiveness. Hitler certainly understood the value of integrating his land, sea and air forces and placing them under a unified command, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (first under Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg's command; later his own). He also saw the benefit of placing them under operational commanders who possessed at least a rudimentary understanding of the tactics, techniques, needs, capabilities and limitations of each of the services functioning in their combat zone. Hitler was thus innovative and several years ahead of his peers in the democracies, Italy and the Soviet Union. Yet, largely because of Hitler's unusual and autocratic command style and difficulties with delegation, the Wehrmacht lacked elements that today's theorists consider essential to the attainment of truly productive jointness (a single joint commander or Joint Chief of Staff, a proper joint staff, a joint planning process, and an absence of inter- service rivalry) and that, as a result, it often suffered needless difficulties in combat. =Iran= The rivalries shaped between security organizations in Iran are as follows: * Persian Cossack Brigade and Gendarmerie (1912‚Äì1921) * Second Bureau of Imperial Iranian Army, SAVAK and Shahrbani (1957‚Äì1979) * Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Islamic Revolutionary Committeess and Shahrbani (1979‚Äì1991) * Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Basij (1979‚Äì1981) * Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Islamic Republic of Iran Army (1979‚Äìpresent) * Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence (Intensified since 2009) =India= Infighting between the Indian Army and Indian Air Force (IAF) over armed helicopters has existed for a decade; this came to light during the Kargil War in 1999. In 2013, Air Chief Marshal NAK Browne, who faced off against the Army for the helicopter issue, said that the AH-64Ds would be kept in the Air Force. =Japan= The long-term discord between the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy was one of the most notorious examples of inter- service rivalry. The situation, with its origin traced back to the Meiji period, came with both geo-political and military consequences leading to Japan's involvement in World War II. The IJA/IJN rivalry expressed itself in the early 1930s as the \\"strike north\\" (Hokushin-ron) and \\"strike south\\" (Nanshin-ron) factions. The goal of both factions was to seize territories which possessed the raw materials, especially petroleum, which Japan needed to sustain its growth and economy, but which it did not possess itself. The strike north faction advocated the taking of the natural resources of Siberia, by way of Manchuria, a scenario in which the prime role would be taken by the Army, the strike south faction advocated the taking of the oil-rich Dutch East Indies, a scenario in which the Navy would predominate. In order to further their own faction, relatively junior officers resorted to the assassinations of members of the rival faction and their supporters in government. With both factions being opposed to the peace faction, this period has become known as the era of government by assassination. Insubordination by the Kwantung Army led first to the occupation of Manchuria, and later the Second Sino-Japanese War following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. However, at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, any farther expansion northwards into Siberia was shown to be impossible given the Soviet superiority in numbers and armour. With the loss of Army prestige that followed the failure of the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts, the Navy faction gained the ascendency, supported by a number of the powerful industrial zaibatsu, that were convinced that their interests would be best served fulfilling the needs of the Navy, and this paved the way to the Pacific War. The IJA and IJN rivalry also saw both services developing air arms, the Army creating its own amphibious infantry units and running ships and submarines, including submarine chasers and aircraft carriers, the Navy meanwhile would create its own infantry and marine paratroopers. Other examples of this rivalry include the Japanese Navy taking several weeks to inform the Army of the disastrous results of the Battle of Midway. =Pakistan= The Pakistani Armed Forces used to fight over a number of issues. One in particular was predominantly between the Navy and the Army over budget distribution. A key point of friction was the induction of the cruiser PNS Babur. This was resolved, however, when Pakistani think tanks realized the need for interservice harmony and established the Joint Services Headquarters. This unified headquarters has almost eliminated the friction between the services. =United Kingdom= A case in point is the rivalry between the Parachute Regiment and the Royal Marines, which are part of the Army and the Royal Navy, respectively, in the UK. Since some of their capabilities overlap, pressure can be put on the political or civilian decision makers to choose one or the other. Another form of rivalry within the United Kingdom is between certain forces of the Cadets: the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet Force, and the Air Training Corps; and between the Coldstream Guards and the Grenadier Guards, over the issue of seniority. =United States= The U.S. Department of Defense was originally created to provide overall coordination for the various branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, whose infighting, particularly between the Army and Navy, was seen as detrimental to military effectiveness during World War II. The rivalries are also based on services' individual philosophies for rules and behavior. An author wrote in 2012 about the differing cultures of the United States Navy and United States Air Force's pilots: Marines and sailors compete in a Strong-Man Competition. Various mechanisms are used to manage or curb interservice rivalries. In the United States Armed Forces, for example, an officer must complete at least one joint tour in another service to reach the level of Flag or General Officer. Such officers may be described as \\"wearing purple,\\" a reference to the Army's green, the Marines' navy blue, the Air Force's blue, the Navy's white, and the Coast Guard's blue uniforms. One well-known encounter, the Revolt of the Admirals, took place after the end of World War II. The newly-created United States Air Force sought to create a doctrine which relied heavily on strategic long-range bombing and the Army a large number of reservist troops. Both the Air Force and the Army claimed that the future of warfare depended on the issue of nuclear deterrent, and as such the use of naval gunfire support, as well as the amphibious assault doctrine of the U.S. Marine Corps, was outdated and would never be used again. The Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson proceeded to strip the Navy of funds on its first supercarrier, the United States. This cancellation caused multiple high ranking Navy personnel to resign. The aftermath backfired against the Navy, and caused Congress to review, and after investigation enabled the implementation of the creation of a Strategic Air Force supporting a nuclear mission. =Special forces= Interservice rivalries are often played out at divisional or regimental level or between special forces that are part of different services. The rivalry between special-forces units led to the creation of United Kingdom Special Forces in the United Kingdom, and SOCOM in the United States to put them all under a unified command, putting an end to the \\"rice-bowl\\" doctrine which created absurd situations in Iran, Grenada and Panama in the 1980s. In the United Kingdom it has put an end to members of the Special Boat Service being recruited solely from the Royal Marines and it is now a tri-service branch.

Klarer's first visitation would have occurred around seven years old and she was one of the first women to claim a sexual relationship with an extraterrestrial. She promoted an ideal of a better world and beliefs in a cosmic consciousness. In her book Beyond the Light Barrier, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilization. She promoted conspiracy theories of an international cover-up which would essentially keep vital information from the public, and claimed to have been threatened with abduction to press her into revealing details about alien technology. Biography Elizabeth was born in 1910 at Mooi River, Natal, as the youngest daughter of SB and Florence Woollatt. SB was a pioneering veterinary surgeon who subsequently settled at Connington farm near Rosetta in the Natal midlands. Here he became a successful shorthorn farmer, and as dedicated polo player, introduced young people to the sport. Here, at age seven, Elizabeth and her older sister Barbara also had their first supposed UFO encounter. While feeding their Sealyham puppies outside the farmhouse Elizabeth and her sister claimed that they witnessed a silver disc bathed in a pearly luster which swooped over them. Simultaneously a giant, orange-red and cratered planetoid was observed orbiting and rotating high in the atmosphere. The disc would have rushed to meet it, pacing and guiding it northwards, while the planetoid left a smoke trail in its wake. Only months later she would have had another sighting in the company of Ladam, their Zulu farm manager. Ladam interpreted the sighting in terms of Zulu mythology. Elizabeth sometimes alluded to an even earlier sighting, at age three in 1913/14. Elizabeth matriculated from St. Anne's Diocesan College in Pietermaritzburg, and moved to Florence, Italy, to study art and music. Thereafter she completed a four-year diploma in meteorology at Girton College, Cambridge, and was taught by her first husband to fly a Tiger Moth light aircraft. In 1932 the three Woollatt sisters and Maureen Taylor formed the Connington polo team and drew a match against the Durban ladies' team, which is seen as the first officially recorded ladies' match in South Africa. During a 1937 flight from Durban to Baragwanath in a Leopard Moth aircraft, she and her husband would have seen a saucer which approached, coasted along, and then departed from them. During World War II she held a responsible position in RAF Intelligence. She believed in telepathic powers, and tried to enhance these abilities since her youth. =Flying Saucer Hill= In 1954, her sister May, then resident on the farm Whyteleafe in the Natal midlands, relayed to her that the native Zulu people were reporting appearances of the lightning bird in the sky. In response Elizabeth and her children travelled from Johannesburg to the farm, and she ascended Flying Saucer Hill the following day, December 27. There she claimed to have seen the star ship descend and hover three metres above ground, while only emitting a soft hum. Its hull was spinning, though its central dome remained stationary. The spaceman who would later identify himself as Akon was clearly visible through one of three portholes. A barrier of heat emanating from the ship would have prevented her from approaching however, and his scout ship departed again. Some 18 months later, she would visit the hilltop again, after further reports of the lightning bird. On this occasion, on 7 April 1956, Akon would have taken her aboard his scout ship, a craft some in diameter. Once inside, she would have met a second pilot, stocky and darker-skinned than Akon, who was supposedly a foremost botanist, besides astrophysicist, by profession. She was allegedly shown a lens which offered views of earth and people through the craft's floor. With only a hum emanating from below and no sense of movement, they would have been transported to the enormous cigar-shaped mother ship which had a garden-like interior. After meeting its inhabitants, she would have been returned to the hilltop, a similar arrangement as that made between Adamski and Orthon in 1952. During the encounter kisses were exchanged and Akon revealed that Elizabeth was in fact a reincarnated Venusian, and long- lost soulmate. He further explained that they would infrequently take earth women as partners, as the offspring would strengthen their race with an infusion of new blood. He also claimed that a number of Venusians were surreptitiously living among people. According to Akon, humans and their own species (strictly speaking, humans) come from the remote and habitable past of the planet Venus. The original civilization would have migrated in the face of changing planetary conditions (including very unpleasant sulfuric acid showers beyond the impossible temperature). From 17:45 on the 30th of April 1956, various independent observers noted a steady red glow poised at a rocky section of the hill, which remained there until 2:00 in the morning. No sign of a fire could be found afterwards. On July 17, 1956, after their family farm was sold, she made a subsequent visit to the area, and claimed to have taken a series of 7 photos of Akon's scout ship using her sister's (or daughter's) simple Brownie box camera. Vivid light flashes would have turned into a dull grey craft enveloped in a shimmering heat haze. For all of an hour the disc would have darted silently over a rise near the farmhouse, making several weaving detours, and it would have shone silvery in bright sunlight before streaking away out of sight. Edgar Sievers, a ufologist from Pretoria, stated that her family saw her leave the homestead alone, and suggested that the frail Elizabeth would have found it difficult to throw a car hubcap and photograph it at the same time. He also stated that no make of hubcap had been illustrated to sufficiently resemble the disc in the photos. =Space- motherhood= In April 1958 a series of contacts would have started which would set her story apart from the 1950s standard. These visits by Akon would have culminated in a day-long rendezvous with Elizabeth on the high plateau of Cathkin Peak, where he supposedly presented her with a silver ring which enhanced their telepathic connection. Their love was then consummated and a child was conceived at her advanced age of 48 years. After a terrestrial pregnancy she (with her MG car) would have been transported in 1959 to Akon's home planet, Meton, supposedly orbiting Proxima Centauri in the nearby multiple-star system Alpha Centauri. There she would have delivered the male child. Her son, Ayling, stayed behind on Meton to be educated, while Elizabeth reluctantly came home. Meton's planetary vibrations affected her heart, and she was consequently not permitted to return there, instead receiving follow- up visits from Akon and Ayling. The whole trip, delivery and return trip supposedly required less than four months, sufficiently long to enable a nine year stay on Meton however. Klarer took far more time before publishing a book, Beyond the Light Barrier (1980), about her extraterrestrial adventures. On his world lecture tour in the late 1950s, George Adamski made a point of visiting South Africa and looking up Klarer for a chat on their variety of experiences with the friendly, wise \\"space brothers.\\" By that time, Klarer was not the only Adamski follower to experience claimed space-motherhood. =Later years= After her sister and brother-in-law died, Elizabeth returned from Natal to Johannesburg. There she worked for a time in a CNA book store, but found city life stifling. From the 1950s onwards her outlandish claims made her a darling of the press, who also loved to ridicule her. She welcomed any press however, as the dissemination of Akon's message was paramount ‚Äì a life- task of extreme importance. The account of her observations and contact experience in Flying Saucer Review of Nov-Dec 1956 was noticed by Edith Nicolaisen. Nicolaisen's correspondence with Elizabeth consists of 23 letters, written from 1956 to 1976. She published the Klarer story in the small booklet I rymdskepp √∂ver Drakensberg in 1959, and a second edition appeared in 1967. From about 1960 to 1966 Elizabeth worked on the manuscript for her book, which now included the Akon love saga, as she couldn't \\"hide the truth in these matters.\\" In 1968 Elizabeth agreed to be interviewed by ufologist Cynthia Hind, and Hind's write-up of her story appeared in Fate magazine of August that year. Ufologist Kitty Smith established contact with Elizabeth after reading about her in Outspan magazine, and claimed her own sighting of Akon's ship in January 1984. When another South African, Ann Grevler, claimed alien contact in the late 1950s, Elizabeth was outspoken and issued various challenges to her to defend her statements in an open forum. Likewise she denounced Philipp Human's supposed contact through a trance medium, and this caused a rift between them. In her view the space people would never stoop to such methods. In 1975 she was invited by Hermann Oberth to attend the 11th International Congress of UFO Research Groups in Wiesbaden, Germany. She delivered an address there on 2 November, for which she received a standing ovation. In May 1992 Smith arranged a talk by Klarer at the Unidentified Flying Object Club in Pietermaritzburg. This was so popular that the crowd grew too large to cope with. Elizabeth faithfully commemorated the April 7th anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill. On one occasion she befriended SAAF helicopter pilots who sought shelter on the farm during a storm, and they facilitated visits to the hill when a ride on horseback became too difficult for her. Her third husband Aubrey Fielding died in 1981 and his ashes were strewn on the hill. Elizabeth died of breast cancer at age 84, leaving her second book The Gravity File unfinished. The book would have filled in the gaps of the first, besides elucidating the military and political aspects of UFO research, and explaining Akon's \\"electro-gravity propulsion\\" technology. Before her death she related to acquaintances that Ayling (like Akon) was now an astrophysicist, who was crisscrossing the universe with his father, his space woman Clea, and their son. Assessment Ufologist Thomas Streicher concluded that Klarer's claims are generally poorly substantiated, despite some of them being corroborated by witnesses. Her sister and first husband for instance attested two UFO sightings, but witnesses are lacking to confirm her pregnancy, and it remains unknown whether it was ever documented. He speculates that she was perhaps a fantasy-prone individual who merely imagined most of her experiences. Elizabeth's son David, in particular, has no recollection of an event, absence or pregnancy of his mother that could tie in with her purported space adventures in 1959. Ufologist Cynthia Hind noted Elizabeth's absolute conviction that she was telling the truth, and never suspected that she was deliberately lying. Hind suspected that an active imagination or illusions borne from a dream-state of euphoria were to be blamed for the improbabilities and inconsistencies inherent to her stories. Both Hind and Smith however alluded to sightings of Akon by members of the public, and Hind concluded: \\"all these factors need examination and it is time we stopped casting aside [such] cases which, although sounding like hoaxes, are not obviously so.\\" Ufologist Edgar Sievers, who also interviewed her family, was completely satisfied that her experiences, at least up to and including the photographs, were of a physical rather than psychic nature. Ufologist Philipp Human initially heaped effusively praise on Elizabeth, but later changed his stance: \\"I do not believe one word of her supposed [‚Ä¶] contacts and it was a standing joke the way she was helped to photograph an ordinary motor car hubcap. So much for her photographs [‚Ä¶] That was before she added additional material to tell of her pregnancy caused by her Venusian lover, [‚Ä¶] I pray that this book will never be published.\\" To this Edith Nicolaisen replied: \\"Don't be afraid, we shall never publish [the story of her Venusian lover, but] I would like to reprint [the] booklet about her contacts. I do believe that she has had some sort of contact.\\" The Mensa chapter of Johannesburg did not take kindly to her claims and she was heckled during her address. Hard evidence for her claim that she addressed the House of Lords in 1983, and that a paper of hers was read during that year at a UFO congress at the United Nations, has not been found. Supposed hard evidence presented by Elizabeth included her set of 1956 photographs, the ring she received from Akon, a space rock or crystal, and a fern from Meton. Her supportive husband Aubrey remained unperturbed by his wife's love for Akon, reportedly saying, \\"That's all right with me ‚Äì as long as he stays in space where he belongs\\".

He committed suicide after the company was raided by the FBI for mail fraud, unveiling nearly US$100 million in debt. Biography Watson was the son of Geraldine Watson (n√©e Johnson) and Gerald Watson, a well-respected local merchant. Bart, as he was known as a schoolboy, grew up in Belding, Michigan, a suburb of Grand Rapids. Barton attended Belding High School, graduating as valedictorian in 1978. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in the fall of 1978. While in Ann Arbor, Watson also volunteered at an ambulance company. He dropped out after only one semester and returned to Belding to help his mother run a local automobile service station. The excessive attachment to his mother was a pattern maintained throughout his adult life. =Washington, D.C.= Following the divorce of his parents and as a result of financial pressures, Watson and his mother Geraldine moved to the Washington, D.C. area in 1981, residing for a short time in an apartment in Alexandria, Virginia, and later moving to another apartment in Washington near Glover-Archbold Park. Through the use of a fraudulent r√©sum√©, Watson obtained employment as a junior account executive at the I Street branch of E. F. Hutton. Watson's boss and mentor was the notorious Perry Bacon, who figured prominently in the E. F. Hutton check- kiting scandal of the early 1980s. Watson went fast and far, and soon managed accounts worth over a million dollars. However, it came undone when it emerged that he had embezzled more than $700,000 in funds from nine clients. Once the embezzlement was discovered, E. F. Hutton fired him in January 1985. The National Association of Securities Dealers subsequently banned him from the securities industry for life. He went on the lam, but was caught and arrested in San Francisco five months later. In May, 1987 Watson pleaded guilty to mail fraud and was sentenced by Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to one to three years in federal prison. CyberNET Engineering Upon his release from prison after more than two years, Watson returned to Belding and lived with his father for six months, working as a server at a Red Lobster restaurant in Grand Rapids. Afterward, he moved to Grand Rapids where he worked as a sales clerk at a large computer store. By 1990 he had met John Straayer, and together they founded a company called WS Services, a \\"value added reseller\\" of computer systems. The business took off, and they changed the company's name to CyberNET Engineering. After meeting his future wife, Krista Kotlarz, in 1991, Watson's relationship with John Straayer deteriorated. It bottomed out in 1992 when Straayer discovered Watson was keeping two sets of books. By his estimate, Watson had embezzled over $300,000 from company accounts for personal use. He sued Watson, and subsequently found out that Watson had hidden his 1987 fraud case. Watson responded with a countersuit, saying that Straayer had been the one embezzling funds. Finally. in 1993, Watson and Straayer agreed to dissolve the partnership in a settlement. However, Watson kept the CyberNET name and relaunched it as a reseller. Between 1991 and 2000, CyberNET was a moderately successful reseller of Compaq computers as well as providing design and installation for clients. Starting in 2000, however, Watson began to obtain fraudulent loans from a large number of financial institutions based on faked and forged financial statements. By 2002 the Watsons were living a fabulous lifestyle, owning a million-dollar home in Ada, Michigan and driving a Land Rover, a Ferrari, a BMW, a Bentley and two Rolls Royces. This lifestyle, and an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to expand the business internationally, were financed by an ever-increasing number of fraudulent loans. In what became a classic Ponzi scheme, new loans were used to repay the debt already incurred. Watson engaged in other fraudulent schemes as well. For instance, one of his salesmen uncovered an attempt to pass off remanufactured computers as new and sell them to the Hastings, Michigan school system. However, a civil suit by the school system ended in an out-of-court settlement. Watson was a very active participant on the travel website FlyerTalk, where he posted numerous anecdotes and observations from his luxurious travels, which often entailed flying to cities around the world in first class. His username on FlyerTalk was \\"B Watson\\", and his posts on FlyerTalk remain viewable to this day. Raid, suicide and trials In December 2003, an anonymous CyberNET employee alerted the FBI office in Grand Rapids to potential fraud at CyberNET, such as fraudulent loans and forged invoices. The Internal Revenue Service and United States Postal Inspection Service quickly joined the investigation. Investigators quickly got in touch with former CyberNET accountant Guy Hiestand, who had suspected shady doings at CyberNET for some time. However, he had never actually reported it because he did not know the culprit. Investigators discovered that CyberNET had rooked four banks into loaning money for new equipment before depositing it into shell companies to keep the company afloat. On November 17, 2004, federal agents raided the CyberNET headquarters on South Division Avenue in Grand Rapids, seizing the business and all of the Watsons's personal assets. Although he had not yet been charged, Watson knew that he faced decades in prison if convicted. He went incommunicado until the night of November 23, when he called 9-1-1 and told the operator that he had a gun in his mouth. This triggered a lengthy standoff with Watson barricading himself in his home. It ended when Watson committed suicide in the early hours of November 24. It was subsequently determined that CyberNET and the Watsons had over $100 million in debt against approximately $2 million in assets.

He was locomotive superintendent of the Great Northern Railway from 1850 until c. 1866, having from 1840 been Daniel Gooch's assistant on the Great Western Railway. Archibald Sturrock is often remembered for his unsuccessful experiment with steam tenders. However, his principal achievement was the opening of the Great Northern main line and the establishment of GNR‚Äôs reputation for a reliable and comfortable passenger service from London to York and beyond. Career =Dundee Foundry= Sturrock was born in 1816. His father, who was agent to the Bank of Scotland, was shocked when Sturrock, aged 15, took an apprenticeship at the Dundee Foundry. Here he was involved with the construction of a locomotive for the Dundee and Newtyle Railway and met Daniel Gooch, who was to become Locomotive Superintendent of the Great Western Railway. =Great Western Railway= Following a period with Fairbairns in Manchester, and travel abroad, Sturrock persuaded Gooch to offer him a post in the Locomotive department of the GWR in 1840. In spite of a difficult initial relationship with Brunel, Sturrock won his confidence and was appointed Works Manager at Swindon Works. Sturrock worked with Gooch, who was based in London, designing and building the Iron Duke and other GWR locomotives. When the recession of the late 1840s hit the GWR, a glowing reference from Brunel helped secure Sturrock the post of Locomotive Superintendent of the Great Northern Railway in 1850. =Great Northern Railway= During his 16 years with the GNR, Sturrock designed over a dozen classes of both passenger and goods locomotives to meet the needs of the fast- growing railway, where the transport of coal and other minerals was as important to the profitability of the line as passenger traffic. Sturrock was accountable for around 40% of expenditure and he continually battled with the chairman and board to persuade them to purchase locomotives, wagons and carriages in time to meet the growing demands of the line. In 1850 when Sturrock joined the GNR, there were 340 employees in the Locomotive Department and the locomotive mileage was 609,092. When he retired in 1866, the employees numbered 3,834 and the mileage was 4,873,113. =Yorkshire Engine Company= Sturrock had a long and active retirement in Doncaster. He was involved with the founding of the Yorkshire Engine Company and chaired the business for several years. He died in London in 1909.

Raghu is seen to be arrogant and negatively shaded since he was young. He smokes and steals money from his father. Once when Raghu attacks Sujatha's classmate when he helps her, Sujatha breaks all bonds with Raghu. When Raghu's family move to another village, Sujatha and Raghu do not even say goodbye to each other. Meanwhile, Raghu's father gifts Sujatha with silver anklets and requests her to never remove them, to which she obliges. Several years pass by. Raghu and Sujatha are fairly distanced. Sujatha grows up to be a beautiful teenage girl, whereas Raghu becomes a rogue and womanizer. Every time his mother speaks of Sujatha, he feels disgusted. He even goes to the extent of sleeping with his servant. Meanwhile, Sujatha goes to college where she meets Ravi. Ravi is from an extremely poor family and does small jobs to survive his only mother and pay money to the moneylender. He has a decent group of friends, and they are classmates with Sujatha. Ravi has an instant crush for Sujatha, while Sujatha does not reciprocate. Ravi asks Sujatha to come to the temple festival, to which she denies, but in the end, Sujatha comes, indicating that she is in love with Ravi. Ravi and Sujatha start dating and communicate with each other on the train by writing to each other on the blackboard at the side of the train. Once, when building up the courage to board the same compartment in the train as Ravi, Sujatha is spotted by the family astrologer She goes home scared, and as she had expected, the astrologer had told Sujatha's father. Her father tells her that she would be married to Raghu, just like they decided years ago. Sujatha protests, but her father stays firm. This results in Sujatha dropping out from college and staying at home. Sujatha has a sister named Kalyani, who turns out to be the messenger between her and Ravi. Raghu comes for the engagement reluctantly (still thinking their childhood encounter) but instantly falls for her the moment he sees her. He warns Sujatha that she would never go away and marry him in the end. They both are engaged. The whole family go to the family temple after the engagement, and there, Sujatha sees Ravi waiting for her. She is spotted talking to Ravi by Raghu and his gang, and they mercilessly beat him up. Traumatized, Sujatha runs to her father, but Raghu indirectly warns her family that things would turn out wrong if Ravi is seen anywhere near Sujatha. Ravi gets treated, and Sujatha's marriage is nearing. As a last hope, Sujatha asks her sister to inform Ravi without letting any of Raghu's men knowing. Her sister goes to the railway station and waits for Ravi. When he comes, fearing that someone would see her, she writes the details on the blackboard. She eyes him to read it and leaves in a haste and is shown that Raghu's men are actually with her. Ravi comes and reads the board. However, Sujatha's sister has a habit for writing the letters \\"it\\" and \\"la\\" in between words, making it difficult for the readers to read it. Ravi ignores the message and leaves. Fearing that Ravi would come and take Sujatha away, Raghu sends his men to Ravi's house. They trash the whole house and the things inside, sparing his mother. His mother tells Ravi's friends that he should come back with Sujatha and if he does not, she herself would kill him. Ravi who somehow cracked the code that Sujatha's sister wrote, realizes that Sujatha's wedding is the next day. He then mysteriously comes into Raghu's home and writes that he would be the one marrying Sujatha in the end, in blood, triggering Raghu. The same thing happens in Sujatha's home on their wedding day. Raghu, in a rush, asks the family to hurry and complete the wedding. Sujatha goes into the room to change, but in reality, she is waiting for Ravi, after seeing his message on the wall. Raghu comes and breaks open the door, and at the same time, Ravi comes through the roof and rescues Sujatha. Angered and defeated, Raghu goes after the couple, and a chase ensues, which results in Ravi getting wounded by Raghu. The couple and Ravi's friend who helped them escape in the train with the help of the conductor, but Raghu enters the train with his men. The couple escapes to the roof, where they are cornered.

A wild mountain region in the Pyrenees, with peaks rising to 3017 m (Besiberri Sud) and with nearly 200 lakes, many of them of glacial origin, the park comprises a core area of 141 km2 and a buffer zone of 267 km2 surrounding the park. The park's name in Catalan is Aig√ºestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici, freely translated as \\"The winding streams and St. Maurice lake\\". The park has an elevation range of 1600 to 3000 metres and contains four major vegetation zones: lower montane, upper montane, subalpine and alpine. The fauna includes Pyrenean chamois, brown bear, marmot, ermine, roe deer, among other mammals and numerous birds (black woodpecker, common crossbill, lammergeier, golden eagle). The park was created in 1955 after Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, first Spanish national park in the Pyrenees in 1918. Its administrative seats are in Espot and Bo√≠. The park is mainly located in the comarques of Pallars Sobir√† and Alta Ribagor√ßa. Geography Boundaries of the park: -In the core zone -In the peripheral areas. -In black, boundaries of Lleida and Andorra. The national park comprises , divided into two different levels of protection: the core area and the buffer zone surrounding the park. This buffer zone creates a gradation from the inner side, more strictly protected than the external parts of the park. The core area is located in the comarques of Pallars Sobir√† and Alta Ribagor√ßa, and includes the main entrances of the park: On the west side, from the village of Bo√≠, is the Aig√ºestortes plain. Aig√ºestortes means \\"winding waters\\" and is largely flat which allows the river to meander and flow slowly. This area indicates the existence of an old lake, today covered by sediment. To the east, near the village of Espot, is Sant Maurici lake, one of the most famous of the region, from where one can see the spectacular twin peaks of the Encantats. This picture is one of the symbols of the park and is the logo of the park. This area also includes part of the municipalities of Vielha e Mijaran and Naut Aran in the Val d'Aran; Vilaller and Vall de Bo√≠ in the Alta Ribagor√ßa; La Torre de Cabdella in the Pallars Juss√†; and Espot, Alt √Äneu, Esterri d'√Äneu, La Guingueta d'√Äneu and Sort in the Pallars Sobir√†. The buffer zone also contains the forest of la Mata de Valencia, Gerber and Cabanes valleys, Colomers and Saboredo valleys, the Besiberri valley, the lakes of Cabdella and Montardo peak. History Aig√ºestortes National Park from Son Human settlement of the Pyrenees dates back at least to the period of glacial melting. Inside the borders of the national park, there is no record of stable human habitation during this time, but recent archeological studies have found evidence of temporary settlements from 8,500 years ago in the Neolithic Age. During the 19th century, the high Pyrenees became more populated, fueled by strong demand for natural resources with intense forestry, farming, and fishing. At the beginning of the 20th century, hydroelectric electrical power plants were built, resulting in a great transformation of the landscape. On 21 October 1955 the national park was created, becoming the fifth Spanish national park. On 30 March 1988, the Catalan government took ownership of the park, together with an additional buffer zone, according to the Catalan laws. From that date, management of the wild protected areas has been managed by the autonomous government, which has introduced increases to the budget and staffing, along with stricter rules. Since then, forestry exploitation, fishing, camping and any exploitation of natural resources has been forbidden. However, an allowance is made for cattle breeding and the operative hydroelectric generation. Traditional uses of natural resources which are compatible with the protection of the wilderness are only allowed in the buffer zone. In 1996 the national park was enlarged, to a total area of 14,119 hectares. In 1997, after litigation between Catalan and Spanish laws, it was agreed that autonomous regions can also take part in the management of the national parks. Biology The park has an elevation range from 1600 to 3000 metres and different orientation of the valleys. For that reason very different ecosystems can be found inside the park. =Vegetation= Aig√ºestortes vegetation The park has a great variety of alpine vegetation owing to the large range of altitudes. In the lower parts of the valleys, around 1500 m high, typical European deciduous forests with pubescens oak Quercus humilis, European ash Fraxinus excelsior, beech Fagus sylvatica or common hazel Corylus avellana can be found. However, former meadow and pastureland which have been historically exploited by humans are now typically occupied with grasslands and shrubs, dominated by common box Buxus sempervirens or secondary forests with Scots pine Pinus sylvestris. From 1500 m to beyond 2000 m, the dominant vegetation is mountain pine Pinus uncinata forest. Growing at altitudes up to 2400 m, it is the tree best adapted to survive the long, hard winters of the High Pyrenees. At this altitude, alpenrose Rhododendron ferrugineum, and blueberry Vaccinium myrtillus which prefers cooler locations, can be found. Heather Calluna vulgaris\\" or common juniper Juniperus communis prefers more sunny and dry areas. In the north faces at less than 2000 m, there are important silver fir Abies alba forests. La Mata de Valencia is the largest Pyrenean fir tree forest. In the alpine meadows, above 2300 m where trees cannot survive, it is possible to find various other alpine flora species, such as Gentiana alpina. Approximately 8% of the species of the park are endemic to the Pyrenees. Around 7% they are plants with boreo-alpine or artico-alpine distribution, with most of them having arrived in the Pyrenees during the last Ice Age. The most important group of the national park flora belongs to the Eurosiberian group, the typical species from central Europe. =Animals= Animals are not easily spotted in the national park. However, there are about 200 species from the phylum Chordata present, of which two-thirds are birds. Some of the most important ones are capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) and bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus). Also possible to see are black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), wallcreeper (Tichodroma muraria), white-throated dipper (Cinclus cinclus), citril finch (Serinus citrinella) among others. Most representative mammal species are Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica), brown bear (Ursus arctos), stoat (Mustela erminea), alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) (which is not native), fallow deer (Dama dama) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) which were also introduced in the national park during the second half of the 20th century. Among the amphibians, the Pyrenean brook salamander (Euproctus asper) is significant but not easy to spot. The common frog (Rana temporaria) is more or less common. It's necessary to be aware of vipera aspis (Vipera aspis), a viper with a poisonous bite, but it does not usually attack without provocation. In the lakes and rivers, brown trout (Salmo trutta fario), the local trout, shares the region with other introduced species. Geology and climate 250px Aig√ºestortes National Park is an important item in the Pyrenean geology. The predominant rocks are granite and slate, both very old Paleozoic rocks. These emerged from the sea in the Paleogene, during the Alpine orogeny, giving rise to the Pyrenees. Successive quaternary glaciations covered these mountains with huge glaciers. The lakes, the waterfalls, the sharpened peaks, the vertiginous ridges and the U-shaped valleys are the footprints of the erosive action of those ancient glaciers. Today, they have virtually disappeared, except for small glaciers in the central Pyrenees. Today, lakes are the most important contribution of these glaciers, which are fed by rivers and waterfalls. The climate in the park is predominantly cold. The mean temperature is around 0 to 5 ¬∞C. In the upper parts, temperatures hardly reach above 0¬∞C during winter. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 900 to 1300 mm - Mostly as snow in the mountains. Management and information 44% of the territory is government owned. Only 6% of the land has private owners, with the village of Espot extending into the eastern part of the park. Even so, exploitation of natural resources is forbidden in the strictly national park. Public use is one of the most important objectives for national parks and people have the right to visit and walk within it. =Information centres= The park has information centres widely distributed in the area. Bo√≠ is one of the main centres of the park. It has also a public library and an exhibition about the settlement of the Pyrenees and the adaptations to live in the mountains. The Park Information Center at Espot also provides an exhibition about the three leading things of the park: rock, water and life. The Museum of the Shepherds is in Llessui, where the exhibition shows the traditional life and work of the shepherds from this valley. Senet has an information center explaining the evolution of the park in the relation between humans and animals: a history about competition, exploitation and good fellowship. During summer months a little information centre is open in Estany Gento, and a cable railway runs in the higher valley of Torre de Cabdella. There are some explanations about the water and the national park. From all of these centres, it is possible to participate in different organised activities. =Tourism= Tourist activities are regulated. Walking access is free, but it is forbidden to collect any rocks, plants, flowers or mushrooms, and hunting and fishing is prohibited. Camping is also prohibited. It is not possible to enter the park by private car. In Espot or Bo√≠, walkers can hire 4x4 taxis which can transport them to a number of popular locations within the park, such as the Aig√ºestortes plain or Sant Maurici lake. At the Val d'Aran entrances during the summertime, there is also a taxi service that provides easier access to the Colomers or Restanca shelters. At the Vall Fosca, the southern entrance of the park, a cableway connects Sallente with estany Gento, where some nice day walks begin. =Trekking= Summertime is a good time for trekking. There are a lot of possibilities, but it's necessary to be aware of the difficulty of some of the paths and be in good physical condition. The transpyrenean path, GR-11 marked with red and white lines, crosses the park from one side to other. At the information points, hiking brochures available (also in English) which are recommended and shows many of the easy paths with descriptions. Some of them are: * At Bo√≠ valley, from Llebreta Lake to Llong Lake, following Sant Nicolau River. Along this path, a footbridge allows the handicapped people with wheelchairs to visit the Aig√ºestortes plain. * From Espot and the Sant Maurici Lake, an interesting path goes up to the waterfall and Ratera Lake. From this lake, after 15 minutes additional walking, it is possible to arrive at a viewpoint looking over the Sant Maurici Lake. A second option is to walk up to Amitges shelter which provides walkers with experience of the high mountains. * From the parking area of Clot Gran, near the Port de la Bonaigua, to Gerber valley and lakes. * From Banhs de Tred√≤s, at the Val d'Aran, walk to Colomers shelter - this provides a very spectacular walk with a number of lakes. * From Estany Gento, walk to Tort Lake and arrive to the Colomina shelter or Sabur√≥ Lake. A very interesting tour for several days: * Camins vius (Living Paths). This route is a walk along the historic valley paths, most dating back to medieval times and some of more ancient origin, through villages surrounding the national park, passing through Alta Ribagor√ßa, Val d'Aran, and Pallars Sobir√†. * Carros de foc (Chariots of Fire). This route completes a circular tour around some of the shelters that exist in this area. The competitive option (Sky runner) must be completed in less than 24 hours but it's better to have at least four or five days in order to appreciate the experience that this route provides. Other mountain activities as rock climbing, alpinism, snowshoeing or backcountry skiing are also allowed (with some regulations) in the national park. The mountain shelters, the only places where visitors are permitted spend a night into the park, are available to stay for allow traversing the higher peaks in the park. =Mountain biking= Cycling is only allowed on paved routes inside the park (just to Sant Maurici Lake or Aig√ºestortes plain) and is strictly regulated. Some routes are available in the peripheral area, most of them with medium or hard level. * Pedals de Foc: is an organized route for riding around the park (not inside) for several days and possibility of backpacking transfer. Refuges Estany Llong refuge, at the Aig√ºestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park Trekkers can find up to ten guarded refuges in the park and its periphery. These are open during four months (end of spring and summer). During the winter, every refuge has its own opening calendar (usually around Christmas and Easter). It's necessary to book them in advance. Central de reservas The refuges are the following: * Amitges * Colomers * Colomina * Ernest Mallafr√© * Estany Llong * Josep M¬™ Blanc * Pla de la Font * Restanca * Saboredo * Ventosa i Calvell http://www.refugiventosa.com/ Additionally, there are two unguarded but well-equipped refuges (Matar√≥ and Besiberri). Surroundings There is a rich architectural heritage in the region, including the Catalan Romanesque churches of the Vall de Bo√≠. UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site in November 2000.Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Bo√≠ - World Heritage website A good example is the Sant Climent de Ta√ºll church.

The two most common types of modern steel girder bridges are plate and box. The term \\"girder\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"beam\\" in reference to bridge design. Design Technology. \\"Beam Bridges\\". Nova. \\"Bridge the Gap\\", section \\"Beam Bridge\\". Robert Lamb and Michael Morrissey. \\"How Bridges Work\\". Ohio Department of Transportation. \\"Bridge Terms Definitions\\" However, some authors define beam bridges slightly differently from girder bridges. Leonardo Fernandez Troyano. \\"Bridge Engineering: A Global Perspective\\". 2003\\\\. A girder may be made of concrete or steel. Many shorter bridges, especially in rural areas where they may be exposed to water overtopping and corrosion, utilize concrete box girder . The term \\"girder\\" is typically used to refer to a steel beam. In a beam or girder bridge, the beams themselves are the primary support for the deck, and are responsible for transferring the load down to the foundation. Material type, shape, and weight all affect how much weight a beam can hold. Due to the properties of the second moment of area, the height of a girder is the most significant factor to affect its load capacity. Longer spans, more traffic, or wider spacing of the beams will all directly result in a deeper beam. In truss and arch-style bridges, the girders are still the main support for the deck, but the load is transferred through the truss or arch to the foundation. These designs allow bridges to span larger distances without requiring the depth of the beam to increase beyond what is practical. However, with the inclusion of a truss or arch the bridge is no longer a true girder bridge. History Girder bridges have existed for millennia in a variety of forms depending on resources available. The oldest types of bridges are the beam, arch and swing bridges, and they are still built today. These types of bridges have been built by human beings since ancient times, with the initial design being much simpler than what we enjoy today. As technology advanced the methods were improved and were based on the utilization and manipulation of rock, stone, mortar and other materials that would serve to be stronger and longer. In ancient Rome, the techniques for building bridges included the driving of wooden poles to serve as the bridge columns and then filling the column space with various construction materials. The bridges constructed by Romans were at the time basic but very dependable and strong while serving a very important purpose in social life. As the Industrial Revolution came and went, new materials with improved physical properties were utilized; and wrought iron was replaced with steel due to steel's greater strength and larger application potential. Design All bridges consist of two main parts: the substructure, and the superstructure. The superstructure is everything from the bearing pads, up - it is what supports the loads and is the most visible part of the bridge. The substructure is the foundation, transfers loads from the superstructure to the ground. Both must work together to create a strong, long-lasting bridge. The superstructure consists of several parts: *The deck is the roadway or walkway surface. In roadway applications it is usually a poured reinforced concrete slab, but can also be steel grid or wood plank. The deck includes any road lanes, medians, sidewalks, parapets or railings, and miscellaneous items like drainage and lighting. *The supporting structure consists of the steel or concrete system supporting the deck. This includes the girders themselves, diaphragms or cross-braces, and (if applicable) the truss or arch system. In a girder bridge this would include only the girders and the bracing system. The girders are the primary load support, while the bracing system both allows the girders to act together as a unit, and prevents the beams from toppling. *The job of the bearing pads is to allow the superstructure to move somewhat independently of the substructure. All materials naturally expand and contract with temperature - if a bridge were completely rigid, this would cause unnecessary stress on the structure and could lead to failure or damage. By fixing the superstructure at one end, while allowing the other end of a span to move freely in the longitudinal direction, thermal stresses are alleviated and the lifespan of the bridge increased. A concrete girder bridge pier during construction prior to installation of the bridge deck and parapets, consisting of multiple angled pylons for support (bottom), a horizontal concrete cap (center), and girders (top) with temporary wood bracing The substructure is made of multiple parts as well: *An abutment is the foundation that transfers the bridge structure to the roadway or walkway on solid ground. A pier is an intermediate support. *The cap is the part that supports the bearing pads. Depending on the type of support structure, there may or may not be a cap. Wall piers and stub abutments do not require a cap, while a multi-column, hammerhead, or pile-bent pier will have a cap. *The stem or stub is the main body of the foundation. It transfers the load from the superstructure, through the cap, down to the footer. *The footer is the structure that transfers the loads into the ground. There are two primary types of systems: a spread footer, which is a simple concrete slab resting on bedrock; or a piling cap, which utilizes steel piles to reach sound bedrock that may be deep underground. Another system utilizes caissons or steel-reinforced concrete \\"pillars\\" below the stem. Types of girders The stubs at the eastern end of the Dunn Memorial Bridge give a good cross section of girder bridge construction * A rolled steel girder is a girder that has been fabricated by rolling a blank cylinder of steel through a series of dies to create the desired shape. These create standardized I-beam and wide flange beam shapes up to 100 feet in length. * A plate girder is a girder that has been fabricated by welding plates together to create the desired shape. The fabricator receives large plates of steel in the desired thickness, then cuts the flanges and web from the plate in the desired length and shape. Plate girders can have a greater height than rolled steel girders and are not limited to standardized shapes. The ability to customize a girder to the exact load conditions allows the bridge design to be more efficient. Plate girder can be used for spans between 10 metres and more than 100 metres (33 feet to more than 330 feet). Stiffeners are occasionally welded between the compression flange and the web to increase the strength of the girder. * A box girder or \\"tub girder\\" is, as the name suggests, a box shape. They consist of two vertical webs, short top flanges on top of each web, and a wide bottom flange connecting the webs together. A box girder is particularly resistant to torsion and, while expensive, are utilized in situations where a standard girder might succumb to torsion or toppling effects.

Lesbian, bisexual, and transgender gamers are often categorized under this term. This demographic has been the subject of two large surveys that attracted press coverage: by Jason Rockwood in 2006, who noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure, and by Paul Nowak in 2009 focusing on what gaymers expect of video games. A gaming convention oriented to LGBT gaming and geek culture, GaymerX, first took place on August 3 and 4, 2013, in San Francisco. Chris Vizzini, owner of the gaming site Gaymer.org, was involved with several online communities (in special with Reddit) between 2007 and 2013 in a controversy and legal dispute over the trademark of the term gaymer, which ended when Vizzini surrendered the right to the term and the trademark was cancelled. Surveys =2006 University of Illinois= In 2006, a sociological study at University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign looked at the gay gamer subgroup focusing on the profile of a \\"gaymer\\", and concerns they have regarding the perception of them in the gaming community and visibility of gay characters in games. The study's author noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure: \\"Gay gamers experience a double edged sword of prejudice... The mainstream gay culture and media is not supportive of video games. Then you have the video game culture that is not supportive of gay culture. So you have these people stuck in the middle who have this double edged prejudice.\\" With about 10,000 respondents the survey exhibited a reverse bell curve of gamer sexuality, with most people identifying as either completely heterosexual or homosexual. Only a \\"very small minority\\" of the respondents to the first survey supported the use of the term gaymer. . =2009 Full Sail University= In late August 2009, Full Sail University student Paul S. Nowak began a second survey of gaymer play preferences. The survey focused on \\"questions of content such as plot, genre, customization and other in-game experiences.\\" The survey team reported that over 7000 people participated in the survey. The results of Nowak's survey were used by Nowak to \\"build a profile of the gay gamer community and gain unique insight into this financially untapped demographic\\". These results were not published in an academic journal, though a later Nowak's book lists gaymers as preferring role-playing video games, pertaining to the hardcore explorer/achiever gamer type, and appreciating good plot and good quality homosexual content, which he defines as game content \\"which reflects homosexual orientation in a positive or equal-to-heterosexual-orientation context\\".  Social and cultural aspects  = Marketing to LGBT consumers = The misconception that young, white, heterosexual males were the force driving the industry forward was strongly challenged by the record-breaking success of The Sims. Video game developer Maxis had resisted Will Wright's goal of creating the title on the grounds that \\"girls don't play video games.\\" The title was seen as unappealing to young heterosexual males.\\"Will Wright, Game Master\\" , by John Seabrook In the 1990s, the industry began to make some effort to market games to women by creating software titles with strong, independent female characters. Even some games that are considered to appeal mainly to the non-traditional demographic continue to censor homosexuality. But some video game companies are now moving to further expand their marketing base to include the perceived market of affluent gaymers by including LGBT characters and supporting LGBT rights. Critics of the suppression of gay identity often conclude that, as homosexuality is normalized in broader culture, it will be in video games as well.games/ \\"Homosexuality in Video Games\\", by Lydia Sung\\"How Not To Address Homosexuality In Gaming\\" , by Mike Fahey = Working inside the industry = Little is known about what it is like to work within the industry as a gay individual. As a result, much of the information that does come to light is in dispute. Dani Bunten, a Trans woman, designed some of the earliest multiplayer games. In 1996, Jacque Servin, a Maxis employee, was fired when he put implied gay characters into the SimCopter game. Depending on the news source, Servin claims to have done it because he was upset at being grossly overworked at Maxis or as some type of political statement. Well-known gay writer and movie director Clive Barker was involved in the creation of games Undying and Jericho. Both of these games received a personal subtitle \\"Clive Barker's\\". = Online Communities = The umbrella term quickly expanded throughout the internet which gave rise to popular online communities which provide a safe space for LGBT gamers and the LGBT gaming culture. Most notable of those on Reddit r/gaymers, r/gayming and VoIP gaming app Discord, Gaymers, London Gaymers, Aussie Gaymer Network and UK Gaymers.  Media coverage = World of Warcraft LGBTQ guilds = One reason many cite for the lack of visible participation by gaymers is the unwelcoming regulations of in-game interactions such as the creation of and advertisement of queer-friendly guilds in MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. Players who attempt to use the general chat channel for recruitment can experience a backlash of harassment and verbal abuse from other players as well as the game moderators. In cases like this, game companies and administrators may alienate game players through intensive policing. In 2006, Sara Andrews started a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ)-friendly guild to create a safe place for this community. In January 2006, Andrews used the general chat channel, because most guilds recruit members this way, to recruit players to her LGBTQ-friendly guild ‚Äò‚ÄòOz‚Äô‚Äô. After posting this, goal administrators quickly contacted Andrews informing her that this was a breach of the games terms of service. The Blizzard terms of service asserts that ‚Äò‚Äòsexual orientation,‚Äô‚Äô including both clear and masked language, which ‚Äò‚Äòinsultingly refers to any aspect of sexual orientation pertaining to themselves or other players‚Äô‚Äô is banned. Andrews ‚Äò‚Äòwas warned by a Blizzard game master that this violated the company‚Äôs policy on harassment,‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚ÄòBlizzard went so far as to threaten Andrews with banishment from the game if she continued‚Äô‚Äô. Blizzard later apologized for this warning, saying that an administrator misinterpreted the policies against harassment. =The Escapist issue Queer Eye for the Gamer Guy= Video game magazine The Escapist devoted Issue 222 to gay gamers and characters with the title \\"Queer Eye for the Gamer Guy\\" (similar to the TV show title).Issue 222 =Same-sex marriage in The Lord of the Rings Online= The MMORPG game The Lord of the Rings Online dropped a planned online marriage feature because of the controversy around restrictions on same-sex and inter- species marriage. The online magazine for gaymers GayGamer.net commented that, while J. R. R. Tolkien was a devout Christian, his stance on gay rights isn't known as the topic wasn't a public issue at the time. = GaymerX convention = On July 31, 2012, a Kickstarter project was started for GaymerCon, which was later renamed to GaymerX, for a convention that billed itself as being \\"the first gaming convention focused on LGBTQ geek culture.\\" Within five days, the Kickstarter project passed the funding goal of $25,000 USD, and after the full funding period of 30 days, the project reached the final total of $91,389. GaymerX took place on August 3 and 4, 2013, in San Francisco. The event has received support from Electronic Arts and GLAAD. = Trademark controversy = In April 2007 Chris Vizzini, owner of the gaming site Gaymer.org, sought to trademark the term gaymer with respect to online communities and obtained it in March 2008. In 2012, he sent a cease and desist letter to reddit's /r/gaymers subreddit forum, for alleged trademark infringement. Vizzini has been criticized by the reddit and gaymer communities, who cite examples of use from as early as 1991, and a Yahoo Groups online community with that name created in 2000.Yahoo Groups - gaymers Vizzini's website was taken out of service in September, 2012; he has claimed that this was due to a denial of service attack. On two occasions Vizzini posted new threads to the /r/gaymers forum explaining his position reddit.com reddit.com and apologizing for \\"hurting his own people\\", but not for filing the trademark. at reddit.com. \\"I guess I could have worded it better when I said I didnt owe an apology. I meant I owed none in terms of my trademarking gaymer. [...] What I do feel badly about is hurting my own people, meaning you guys. So for that I do apologize. It wasnt [sic] my own people I thought I was dealing with. I thought it was a company called reddit who was swiping traffic to my site.\\" On January 24, 2013, members of /r/gaymers, supported by pro bono lawyers from Perkins Coie and Electronic Frontier Foundation, filed a petition at the US Patent and Trademark Office to cancel Vizzini's trademark on the term, on the basis that it was used with that meaning since the mid-1990s. Vizzini reinstated his intent to defend the trademark on the site's name, that he started as an online community on 2003 as a way to build a positive brand from a term that had negative connotations. On June 25, 2013, it was announced that Gaymer.org was being officially closed down. \\"The reason I‚Äôm closing the site is because the goals were accomplished but also because I feel disconnected from gay gamers having seen their ugly side though all of this. I know it‚Äôs not all gay gamers from the members of my site but its was enough of them saying hurtful things so loudly that it has put me off. What was once a source of passion has now become a source of pain and it‚Äôs time to walk away and say goodbye.\\" - Chris Vizzini On August 22, 2013, the US Patent and Trademark office officially canceled the trademark after Vizzini decided to surrender the mark. = Nintendo's Tomodachi Life controversy = In 2014 Nintendo, and their life simulator videogame, Tomodachi Life, which allows for the creation of avatars called Mii's to interact with one another came under fire for only allowing opposite sex Mii's to flirt with one another or become married leading to disappointment amongst LGBTQIA+ fans of the company. Nintendo responded by stating that \\"Nintendo never intended to make any form of social commentary with the launch of 'Tomodachi Life,'\\" Nintendo of America Inc. said in a statement. \\"The relationship options in the game represent a playful alternate world rather than a real-life simulation. We hope that all of our fans will see that 'Tomodachi Life' was intended to be a whimsical and quirky game, and that we were absolutely not trying to provide social commentary.\\" Nintendo later apologized for the incident and disappointing their fans stating \\"We apologize for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life,\\" Nintendo said in a statement released Friday. \\"Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to change this game's design, and such a significant development change can't be accomplished with a post-ship patch.\\"  See also  * LGBT characters in video games  References  Category:LGBT and video games Category:LGBT portrayals in mass media Category:LGBT terminology Category:Video game culture ","title":"Gaymer"},{"id":"5049142","text":"Marius Petipa's final revival of La Bayad√®re, with the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre shown in the scene The Kingdom of the Shades. In the center is alt= La Bayad√®re (\\"the temple dancer\\") (ru. ¬´–ë–∞—è–¥–µ—Ä–∫–∞¬ª, Bayaderka) is a ballet, originally staged in four acts and seven tableaux by French choreographer Marius Petipa to the music of Ludwig Minkus. The ballet was staged especially for the benefit performance of the Russian Prima ballerina Ekaterina Vazem, who created the principal role of Nikiya. La Bayad√®re was first presented by the Imperial Ballet at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, on . From the first performance the ballet was universally hailed by contemporary critics as one of the choreographer Petipa's supreme masterpieces, particularly the scene from the ballet known as The Kingdom of the Shades, which became one of the most celebrated pieces in all of classical ballet. By the turn-of-the 20th century, The Kingdom of the Shades scene was regularly extracted from the full-length work as an independent showpiece, and it has remained so to the present day. Nearly all modern versions of La Bayad√®re are derived from the Kirov Ballet's production of 1941, which was a severely redacted edition staged by Vakhtang Chabukiani and Vladimir Ponomarev in Leningrad in 1941. Natalia Makarova's 1980 production of La Bayad√®re for American Ballet Theatre was the first full-length production to find a permanent place in the repertories of western ballet troupes, having been staged by several theatres throughout the world. Makarova's version is itself derived from Chabukiani and Ponomarev's 1941 redaction for the Mariinsky Theatre.  Origins  La Bayad√®re was the creation of the dramatist Sergei Khudekov and of Marius Petipa, the renowned Premier ma√Ætre de ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The music was composed by Ludwig Minkus, who from 1871 until 1886 held the official post of Ballet Composer to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. =Plot outline= Khudekov's libretto for La Bayad√®re (meaning The Temple Dancer or The Temple Maiden) tells the story of the bayad√®re Nikiya and the warrior Solor, who have sworn eternal fidelity to one another. The High Brahmin, however, is also in love with Nikiya and learns of her relationship with Solor. Moreover, the Rajah Dugmanta of Golconda has selected Solor to wed his daughter Gamzatti (or Hamsatti, as she is known in the original production), and Nikiya, unaware of this arrangement, agrees to dance at the couple's betrothal celebrations. In his effort to have Solor killed and have Nikiya for himself, the jealous High Brahmin informs the Rajah that the warrior has already vowed eternal love to Nikiya over a sacred fire. But the High Brahmin's plan backfires when, rather than becoming angry with Solor, the Rajah decides that it is Nikiya who must die. Gamzatti, who has eavesdropped on this exchange, summons Nikiya to the palace in an attempt to bribe the bayad√®re into giving up her beloved. As their rivalry intensifies, Nikiya picks up a dagger in a fit of rage and attempts to kill Gamzatti, only to be stopped in the nick of time by Gamzatti's ayah. Nikiya flees in horror at what she has almost done. As did her father, Gamzatti vows that the bayad√®re must die. At the betrothal celebrations Nikiya performs a somber dance while playing her veena. She is then given a basket of flowers which she believes are from Solor, and begins a frenzied and joyous dance. Little does she know that the basket is from Gamzatti, who has concealed beneath the flowers a venomous snake. The bayad√®re then holds the basket too close and the serpent bites her on the neck. The High Brahmin offers Nikiya an antidote to the poison, but she chooses death rather than life without her beloved Solor. Ekaterina Vazem costumed as Nikiya for Act II of La Bayad√®re. St. Petersburg, 1877. Lev Ivanov costumed as Solor for Act I of La Bayad√®re. St. Petersburg, 1877. In the next scene the depressed Solor smokes opium. In his dream-like euphoria he has a vision of Nikiya's shade (or spirit) in a nirvana among the star-lit mountain peaks of the Himalayas called The Kingdom of the Shades. Here, the lovers reconcile among the shades of other bayad√®res. (In the original 1877 production, this scene took place in an illuminated enchanted palace in the sky.) When Solor awakes, preparations are underway for his wedding to Gamzatti. In the temple where the wedding is to take place the shade of Nikiya haunts Solor as he dances with Gamzatti. When the High Brahmin joins the couple's hands in marriage, the gods take revenge for Nikiya's murder by destroying the temple and all of its occupants. In an apotheosis, the shades of both Nikiya and Solor are reunited in death and eternal love.  Early productions  La Bayad√®re was created especially for the benefit performance of Ekaterina Vazem, Prima ballerina of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The role of Solor was created by the forty-three-year-old Lev Ivanov, Premier danseur of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, with the classical dances of the character Solor being performed by the younger Pavel Gerdt. The celebrated ballerina Maria Gorshenkova created the role of Gamzatti (or Hamsatti, as the character was known in the original production), while the role of the High Brahmin was created by Nikolai Golts. Dugmanta, the Rajah of Golconda was created by Christian Johansson, former Premier danseur of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres and an influential teacher. The lavish d√©cor was designed by Mikhail Bocharov for Act I-scene 1; Matvei Shishkov for Act I-scene 2 and Act II; Ivan Andreyev for Act III-scene 1 and Act IV-scene 1; Heinrich Wagner for Act III-scene 2 The Kingdom of the Shades; and Piotr Lambin for the Act IV-scene 2 Apotheosis. Petipa spent almost six months staging La Bayad√®re. During rehearsals, Petipa clashed with the Prima ballerina Vazem over the matter of her entrance in the ballet's final Grand pas d'action, while also experiencing many problems with the set designers who constructed the ballet's elaborate stage effects. Petipa was also worried that his new work would play to an empty house, as the Imperial Theatre's Director Baron Karl Kister increased the ticket prices to be higher than that of the Italian Opera, which at that time were expensive. The most celebrated and enduring passage of La Bayad√®re was Petipa's grand vision scene known as The Kingdom of the Shades. Petipa staged this scene as a Grand pas classique, completely devoid of any dramatic action. His simple and academic choreography was to become one of his most celebrated compositions, with the Sortie des bayad√®res of the thirty-two member Corps de ballet of shades arguably becoming his most celebrated composition of all. Petipa's final revival of La Bayad√®re was first given on especially for the dual benefit performance of the Imperial Theatre's Premier danseur Pavel Gerdt and the Prima ballerina Mathilde Kschessinskaya. Among Petipa's changes for this revival was the re-setting of the scene The Kingdom of the Shades from an enchanted castle in the sky on a fully lighted stage, to a dark and rocky setting on the peaks of the Himalayas. Petipa swelled the number of dancers in the Corps de ballet from thirty-two to forty-eight, making the illusion of descending spirits all the more effective in the famous Sortie des bayad√®res. In March 1903, the scene The Kingdom of the Shades was performed independently during a gala performance at Peterhof Palace in honor of a state visit from Kaiser Wilhelm II. This is the earliest known occasion where the scene The Kingdom of the Shades was performed as an independent concert piece.  Vaganova's revival  On December 13, 1932 the great pedagogue of the Soviet Ballet Agrippina Vaganova presented her version of La Bayad√®re for the Kirov Ballet (the former Imperial Ballet). Vaganova revised the ballerina's dances for her star pupil Marina Semenova, who danced Nikiya. This included triple pirouettes sur la pointe (on the toes), and fast piqu√© turns en dehors. Although Vaganova's revival did not find a permanent place in the repertory, her modifications to the Ballerina's dances would become the standard.  The Kirov Ballet's revival of 1941  In 1940 the Kirov Ballet once again made plans to revive La Bayad√®re, this time in a staging by the Balletmaster Vladimir Ponomarev and the Premier danseur Vakhtang Chabukiani. This version would be the definitive staging of La Bayad√®re from which nearly every subsequent production would be based. The Ponomarev/Chabukiani revival of La Bayad√®re premiered on February 10, 1941 to a resounding success, with Natalia Dudinskaya as Nikiya and Vakhtang Chabukiani as Solor. The choreography for the character of Nikiya went through a renaissance in when performed by the virtuoso ballerina Dudinskaya, whose revisions to the choreography remain the standard. Although her interpretation of the tragic Nikiya was looked on as unsuitable for the stellar ballerina, she nevertheless excelled in The Kingdom of the Shades, where Petipa's strict academic patterns prevailed. In the Variation de Nikiya (often referred to as the Scarf Duet) Ponomarev and Chabukiani changed the original staging of Petipa - originally, this variation called for Nikiya to perform her variation alone, with a long veil connected by wire to a fly-space above the stage, with the veil flying upward upon the final moments of the variation. The variation was changed so that Solor would now hold one end of the veil as Nikiya danced, departing the stage half-way through her solo offstage. Dudinskaya studded the choreography with multiple tours en arabesque, and included, for the first time, airy splits in her Grand jet√©s during the Entr√©e de Nikiya, as well as adding fast piqu√© turns in the Grand coda. The choreography for Solor went through a renaissance as well with the great Premier danseur Chabukiani in the role. Although the dances for the role of Solor had become far more prominent since La Bayad√®re had been performed in Imperial Russia, Chabukiani's revisions to the choreography would become the standard for all proceeding male dancers. In 1977, the Kirov Ballet's 1941 Ponomarev/Chabukiani production of La Bayad√®re was filmed and later released onto DVD/video with Gabriella Komleva as Nikiya, Tatiana Terekhova as Gamzatti, and Rejen Abdeyev as Solor.  La Bayad√®re in the West  alt= Although La Bayad√®re was considered a classic in Russia, the work was almost completely unknown in the west. The first western production of the scene The Kingdom of the Shades was mounted by Eugenia Feodorova at the Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It premiered on April 12, 1961 with Bertha Rosanova as Nikiya and Aldo Lotufo as Solor. But it was to be the Kirov Ballet's performance of The Kingdom of the Shades at the Palais Garnier in Paris on July 4, 1961 that roused widespread interest in this almost totally unknown ballet from the Imperial/Petipa repertory. Two years later, Rudolf Nureyev staged the scene for the Royal Ballet with Margot Fonteyn as Nikiya. Minkus's music was re-orchestrated by the Royal Opera House's composer/conductor John Lanchbery. The premiere was a resounding success, and is considered to be among the most important moments in the history of ballet. The dance critic Arlene Croce commented on Petipa's The Kingdom of the Shades in her review of Makarova's staging of the scene in The New Yorker: Nureyev's version of The Kingdom of the Shades was also staged by Eugen Valukin for the National Ballet of Canada, premiering on March 27, 1967. The first full-length production of La Bayad√®re was staged by the Balletmistress Natalie Conus for the Iranian National Ballet Company in 1972, in a production based almost entirely on the 1941 Ponomarev/Chabukiani production for the Kirov Ballet. For this production Minkus' score was orchestrated from a piano reduction by Robin Barker. The National Ballet of Panama's debut performance was La Bayad√®re (1972), the principal dancers were Teresa Mann, Ginela Vazquez, Armando Villamil, Nitzia Cucalon, Raisa Gutierrez and Alejandro Lugo.  Natalia Makarova‚Äôs production  alt= 300x300px In 1974 Natalia Makarova mounted The Kingdom of the Shades for American Ballet Theatre in New York City, being the first staging of any part of La Bayad√®re in the United States. In 1980 Makarova staged her own version of the full-length work for the company, based largely on the Ponomarev/Chabukiani version she danced during her career with the Kirov Ballet. Makarova's production premiered on May 21, 1980 at the Metropolitan Opera House, and was shown live on PBS during the Live from Lincoln Center broadcast. Makarova danced the role of Nikiya herself, but was replaced by Marianna Tcherkassky due to an injury during the first act. The principal roles included Anthony Dowell as Solor, Cynthia Harvey as Gamzatti, Alexander Minz as the High Brahmin and Victor Barbee as the Rajah. The d√©cor was designed by Pier Luigi Samaritani, with costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge and lighting by Toshiro Ogawa. The premiere was a triumph for American Ballet Theatre, and the company has performed it consistently ever since. In 1989, Makarova staged her version of La Bayad√®re for the Royal Ballet in a totally un-changed production, including copies of Samaritani's designs for the d√©cor, and new costumes by Yolanda Sonnabend. In 1990 her production was filmed, and later shown on PBS in 1994 and later released onto DVD/Video. The cast included Altynai Asylmuratova as Nikiya, Darcey Bussell as Gamzatti and Irek Mukhamedov as Solor. Makarova has since staged her production for many companies throughout the world, including the Ballet of La Scala (who have recently filmed their production and released it onto DVD), the Australian Ballet, the Polish National Ballet, the Stanislavsky Ballet in Moscow and the Royal Swedish Ballet.  Rudolf Nureyev's production  In late 1991, Rudolf Nureyev, artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet, began making plans for a revival of the full-length La Bayad√®re, to be derived from the traditional Ponomarev/Chabukiani version he danced during his career with the Kirov Ballet. Nureyev enlisted the assistance of his friend and colleague Ninel Kurgapkina, former Prima Ballerina of the Kirov Ballet, to assist in staging the work. The administration of the Paris Op√©ra knew that this production of La Bayad√®re would be Nureyev's last offering to the world, as his health was deteriorating more and more from advanced AIDS disease. Because of this, the cultural administration of the Paris Op√©ra gave the production an enormous budget, with even more funding coming from various private donations. Nureyev called upon the Italian opera designer Ezio Frigerio to create the d√©cor, and his wife opera designer Franca Squarciapino to create the ballet's costumes. Frigerio took inspiration from the Taj Mahal and the architecture of the Ottoman Empire, as well as drawings of the original d√©cor used for Petipa's 1877 production - Frigerio called his designs \\"a dream of the Orient through Eastern-European eyes\\". Squarciapino's costume designs were inspired by ancient Persian and Indian paintings, with elaborate head-dresses and hats, colorful shimmering fabrics, and traditional Indian garb, with much of the materials coming from Parisian boutiques that imported directly from India. Nureyev's production of La Bayad√®re was presented for the first time at the Palais Garnier (or the Paris Op√©ra) on October 8, 1992 with Isabelle Gu√©rin as Nikiya, Laurent Hilaire as Solor, and √âlisabeth Platel as Gamzatti (and was later filmed in 1994 and released onto DVD/video with the same cast). The theatre was filled with many of the most prominent people of the ballet world, along with throngs of newspaper and television reporters from around the world. The production was a resounding success, with Nureyev being honored with the prestigious Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Minister of Culture. The premiere of Nureyev's production was a special occasion for many in the world of ballet, as only three months later he died. The danseur Laurent Hilaire later commented on Nureyev's revival:  Sergei Vikharev's production  In 2000 the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet began mounting a new production of Petipa's 1900 revival of La Bayad√®re. The choreographer Sergei Vikharev made use of the Stepanov Choreographic Notation from the Sergeyev Collection to assist on mounting the choreography. The production included the long deleted final act, which included the lost Danse des fleurs de lotus (Dance of the Lotus Blossoms) and Petipa's original Grand Pas d'action, which up to that point had been performed during the second act in a revised edition from 1941 as staged by Vladimir Ponomarev and Vakhtang Chabukiani. In spite of the fact that the production was billed as a \\"reconstruction\\", Vikharev retained nearly all of the Soviet-era choreography. For the majority of the 20th century Minkus's original score for La Bayad√®re was thought to have been lost. Unbeknownst to the company, the Mariinsky Theatre's music library had in their possession two volumes of Minkus's complete, hand-written score of 1877, as well as three manuscript rehearsal r√©p√©titeurs in arrangement for two violins, which included many notes for ballet masters and performers. Sergei Vikharev commented on the restoration of Minkus's score: The Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet opened the 10th International Stars of the White Nights Festival with their reconstruction of La Bayad√®re at the Mariinsky Theatre on May 31, 2002, with Daria Pavlenko as Nikiya, Elvira Tarasova as Gamzatti, and Igor Kolb as Solor. The production received a mixed reaction from the St. Petersburg audience, which largely comprised the most prominent persons of the Russian ballet. The celebrated Ballerina of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet Altynai Asylmuratova was seen weeping after the performance, allegedly because of her shock at seeing the ballet presented in this way. When the company included the production on their tours, it caused a sensation around the world, particularly in New York and London. To date the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet only perform the Vikharev production on special occasions.  Stanton Welch's production  Stanton Welch created his version of La Bayad√®re for the Houston Ballet's 40th season in 2010, with Sara Webb as Nikiya, Connor Walsh as Solor, James Gotesky as the priest and Kelly Myernick as Gamzatti. The set and costumes were designed by Peter Farmer to give an Indian, Bollywood, look. Welch worked with live snakes during the preparation and they were used in the production. John Lanchbery's arrangement of the music by Ludwig Minkus was further modified by Ermanno Florio, the music director of the Houston Ballet Orchestra. Welch's version was the first full production of La Bayad√®re to be staged in Australia, by The Australian Ballet in 2014, with Leanne Stojmenov as Nikiya, Kevin Jackson as Solor and Laura Tong as Gamzatti. Reviewer Michaela Marshall notes particularly the performance of the corps de ballet in the Kingdom of the Shades scene which is danced in the traditional short white tutus.  Other productions  Among other notable productions is Vladimir Malakhov's staging of La Bayad√®re for Vienna State Opera in 1999 and for Staatsballett Berlin in 2002.

Because of its cultural and architectural importance the residence has been designated a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance.  History  This palace was used for living until 1829, but taking into consideration its age and state Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá had decided to build another residence. New residence as it had been called during its construction was larger and more exclusive than the Master‚Äôs as it was supposed to show the economic growth and further strengthening of power of Obrenoviƒá after having received the Hatisherif (Sultan's Edict) in 1830. The building residence is one of the most remarkable among the preserved examples of civil architecture in the first half of the 19th century Belgrade. It was built during the period from 1829 to 1830. According to plans of Prince Milo≈°, the residence was supposed to have a twofold purpose ‚Äì to be a home for his family, Princess Ljubica and his sons Milan and Mihailo, later rulers of Serbia and at the same time a residential palace. It was built according to ideas and under supervision of Had≈æi-Neimar, the pioneer of Serbian building and construction. Prince Milo≈° decided to hire a constructor from Voden, Hadzi Nikola Zivkovic, since there were none in Belgrade at that time for there were no construction activities for years. Thus Had≈æi-Neimar became the first builder of renewed Serbia and he managed all of Prince Milo≈°'s buildings during his first reign. Foundation started in July 1829, and the residence was finished in late autumn 1830. Princess Ljubica informed her husband in a letter from November 22, 1830 that \\"they have settled in the new residence\\". A new Turkish bath (hammam), with one-storey wing was built later on in 1836.  Location  It is situated at the corner of Kneza Sime Markovica Street and Kralja Petra Street, former Bogojavljanska and Dubrovacka Street, in one of the oldest parts of Belgrade. Just across the present Cathedral Church the Old palace of Prince was situated stretching from the entrance of today‚Äôs Building of the Patriarchate to the garden of current Princess Ljubica Residence. Princess Ljubica Residence is placed in a free space in the center of a garden, initially fenced by a high wall as other buildings of this type and surrounded by greenery. It had an outer yard where one could enter through the car entrance as well as the spacious inner garden toward Kosancicev venac. Princess Ljubica Residence is facing the Sava River with its main fa√ßade dominated by a bay window of the divanhana (tur. a room used for smoking and talking).  Architecture  Residence‚Äôs base has a rectangular form and is proportionally large; it has three levels ‚Äì basement, ground floor and an upper storey. The basement is covered by vaults while ground and upper storey have been built in classic brickwork and ‚Äùbondruk‚Äù manner with timber construction filled with unbaked bricks. Four slopes roof is covered with tiles with an octagonal dome and eight chimneys on it.http://beogradskonasledje.rs/wp- content/uploads/2012/06/Konak_kneginje_Ljubice.pdf This building has all characteristics of city houses of Serbian-Balkan style. Ground and upper storey have a centre hall around which all other rooms are situated, showing a traditional Oriental space concept, which originates from former closed inner yard model. There are divanhanas on both floors, which is a type of today‚Äôs dining room, but also a reception salon. The ground floor divanhana is separated from the rest of the area by two steps and lined by wooden columns divided with parapets. Wide stairs, leading into garden, are located immediately beside it and this entrance is wider than the one leading toward the street.http://beogradskonasledje.rs/wp- content/uploads/2012/06/Konak_kneginje_Ljubice.pdf The other divanhana, on the upper floor, is more intimate. It is lined with walls on the side, and it has only two columns facing the central space. Its floor was in line with the surrounding floor and they were all made out of wood. This divanhana is overviewing the street.http://beogradskonasledje.rs/wp- content/uploads/2012/06/Konak_kneginje_Ljubice.pdf Although leaning to Oriental tradition with its spacious concept, Princess Ljubica Residence represents the breaking point in architecture of Belgrade, because it largely indicates the influence of European architecture with its exterior design and decorative elements. These European concepts are especially notable in diversity of facades, broken roof lines, chimneys and dome, in secondary details of architectonic fa√ßade treatment ‚Äì pilasters, arch endings and window surroundings, profiled wreaths and some interior details. Bay windows on a fa√ßade of Princess Ljubica Residence which are usually rectangular have a half-circular base.http://beogradskonasledje.rs/wp- content/uploads/2012/06/Konak_kneginje_Ljubice.pdf  Development of the residence  Ljubica Vukomanoviƒá, Princess consort of Serbia One of the first records about Princess Ljubica Residence is from travel-writer Otto Dubislav Pirch,[–ü–∏—Ä—Ö –û—Ç–æ –î—É–±–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤, –ü—É—Ç–æ–≤–∞—ö–µ –ø–æ –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∏ —É –≥–æ–¥. 1829, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥, 1899.] from 1892: ‚ÄúOne small part of Belgrade stands out in comparison to others, and this is one small place at the Southwest end of the upper town main street. (‚Ä¶) Although not the largest in its form it is the most beautiful building I have seen in Serbia‚Äú.1 Consistent to its intended function, the new Residence differed from the common private houses and it ‚Äúcontains certain characteristics which (‚Ä¶) place it among fortified palaces of great Pashas and wealthy Beys (tur. for a leader of a small region or province)‚Äú.[–ë—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Å–ª–∞–≤ –Ç. –ö–æ—ò–∏—õ, –í–∞—Ä–æ—à–∏—Ü–µ —É –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∏ XIX –≤–µ–∫–∞, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ 1970.] Princess Ljubica, modest by nature, wanted to arrange a high life in the Palace. Saved correspondence between the Princess and Prince Milos from January 1, 1831 states that the Princess asked her husband ‚Äúto provide red socks for servants in the palace‚Äú. Presumably, the Princess got a negative reply, considering that in the letter from January 24 she claims ‚Äúthat she can manage without any servants‚Äú. The main state treasury was situated in Princess Ljubica Residence during the first reign of Prince Milos. Princedom Regency held their sessions in the Residence until the return of Prince Miahilo to Serbia in 1840, who lived there until 1842.  From the Lyceum to the gallery and the museum  The Lyceum was afterwards situated there, then the First Grammar School of Belgrade and the Supreme Court of Appeals. The Institution for education of deaf and dumb children was situated here in 1912 and Contemporary Art Museum since 1929. The Residence housed the Church Museum until April 6, 1941. Part of Patriarchate was located here from 1945‚Äì47 and the Republic Institute for Cultural Heritage Preservation since 1947.http://www.mgb.org.rs/en/visit/the- residence-of-princess-ljubica Preservation and restoration works were performed during the period from 1971 to 1979, when rehabilitation and renewal of facades and interiors were carried out. On this occasion, Princess Ljubica Residence, today an integral part of the Museum of Belgrade, was adapted for a prestigious museum exhibit.http://www.mgb.org.rs/en/visit/the-residence-of- princess-ljubica Princess Ljubica Residence has been proclaimed as 1st category cultural property in 1979.http://www.mgb.org.rs/en/visit/the- residence-of-princess-ljubica  Gallery File:R√©sidence de la princesse Ljubica.jpgPrincess Ljubica's Residence File:KonakLjubice1.jpgPrincess Ljubica's Residence 2008.

Ala Littoria routes in 1940 grew to 37,110 km, mainly in the Mediterranean and Africa. This gave Italy the fifth most extensive air routes in the world (after the US, the USSR, Germany and the UK). During the Second World War, Ala Littoria acted as a transport service for the Italian military. However the airline did not survive the war and was disbanded. It was substituted after the war by Alitalia ‚Äì Linee Aeree Italiane, that was established on 16 September 1946 as \\"Aerolinee Italiane Internazionali\\" and later was called Alitalia. Airports connected In 1940 Ala Littoria reached and connected the following airports: Italy * Alghero, Ancona, Bologna, Brindisi, Cagliari, Catania, Fiume (at that time Italian territory), Genoa, Lussino (at that time Italian territory), Milan, Naples, Palermo, Pola (at that time Italian territory), Rimini, Rhodes, Rome, Syracuse, Trapani, Trieste, Venice, Zara (at that time Italian territory).

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Palilula.  Location  Deponija was located under the Panƒçevo bridge, spawning along the Vuka Vrƒçeviƒáa street, near the right bank of the Danube. It is bordered by the neighborhood of Ada Huja to the east, Viline Vode to the west and Bogoslovija to the south.  History  Deponija is actually a slum, Brazilian type favela, officially classified as an unhygienic settlement. Settling of the area began in the mid 1970s. As the area became informal (wild) landfill (deponija, Serbian for landfill, thus the name), tens of thousands of cubic meters of garbage were dumped in the area in the next few decades. Major influx of population occurred after the expulsion of the non-Albanian population from Kosovo after the Kosovo War in 1999. Romani people who took refuge in Germany were deported back to Serbia and some of them settled in the area. Already as of 2000/01, name Deponija emerged as a name of the settlement. It is estimated that Deponija is the largest of the 15 unhygienic settlements in the territory of the municipality of Palilula where altogether 15,000 people live. The exact number of population of Deponija itself is not known and the estimates vary from 900 to 2,000. After cleaning and destruction of Kartonsko naselje in Novi Beograd, it is the largest slum of Belgrade.  Quality of life and future  Some NGOs claim it has the worst conditions of any unhygienic settlements in Belgrade, but the case of the Goveƒëi Brod in Zemun, recently destroyed by the Danube floods, is probably even worse. However Deponija do have some of the worst life conditions as it has absolutely no sewage and electricity and only very small number of houses have running water. Houses are made of hot clay and dried mud, cardboard and tin, between the hillocks of garbage and feces-infested ponds of dirty water. For the time being, the problem can't be solved as informal settlements can be turned into a formal ones (which would mean the city government would have to introduce power, sewage, water) only if they are built on city land, and the ownership of the land that Deponija is built on is disputed. Port of Belgrade, which was acquired by the Serbian tycoon Milan Beko, claims ownership of the entire city's right bank of the Danube, including this area, too. The city has been suing the Port for years, where one court would decide that city is the owner, and than the higher court would say differently and so on. Port of Belgrade stated that it is not in their jurisdiction to deal with the problem. The project of relocating population from Deponija to the new container-based temporary settlement in Reva, neighborhood of Krnjaƒça, from 2003, remained on paper only.

He describes his musical style as \\"Blufunk\\", which is a fusion between raw blues elements and hard, edgy funk rhythms. Also his Nigerian roots in Yoruba music and soul music can be considered a major influence on his sound. He is known for his distinctive style of guitar playing, including his percussive right-hand technique which is similar to a bass guitarist's slapping technique.  Life and career  Olufemi Sanyaolu a.k.a. Keziah Jones is the son of Oshodolamu Sanyaolu; Chief of the Yoruba people and successful industrialist and Abiola Sanyaolu. Born on 10 January 1968, Jones spent his early childhood in a large family in a part of Nigeria in the city of Lagos. From a young age he was being prepared to follow his father's footsteps in the family concern and was expected to have an academic career. Therefore, his father enrolled him in a Public School in London and he left Nigeria at the age of eight to be educated in England. \\"I had to find a way out of all that, and music was it!\\" By the age of 13 he had discovered the old school piano and taught himself how to play and write songs. Three years later he switched to the guitar, increasingly neglecting his studies. After scraping through exams he went against his father's wishes and family tradition even more by skipping school and busking in the streets, clubs and London Underground, constantly avoiding the police. Jones led a bohemian lifestyle for several years instead of the one envisaged for him. \\"Lose all time, love your mind, free your soul!\\" were words from his song Free Your Soul. Moving from London to Paris and back again frequently accompanied only by his guitar, the young Jones acquired a reputation as a talented musician and charismatic performer with a unique \\"hard funk\\" style. In 1990, whilst busking in London's Portobello Road, Keziah was discovered by composer and ex-keyboard player for Sailor and Culture Club, Phil Pickett quickly evolving into full-time management of the artist. Pickett signed Jones to a long-term songwriting agreement with Hit & Run Music Publishing (photo Billboard 1990) who's executive, Dave Massey, had recorded songs by Jones when at Chrysalis Music. Massey continued to be involved in Keziah's career for the next 8 years. After a brief but near disastrous flirtation with Capitol Records in the USA, in 1992, Pickett signed Keziah to Emmanuel de Buretel's Delabel label for his debut album Blufunk Is a Fact. Recording in London with producer Kevin Armstrong, included in the worldwide success of the project was Keziah's first single \\"Rhythm Is Love\\". Jones attributes his Parisian subway experiences as highly instrumental to his by now blossoming career in his official biography.Keziah Jones Official Biography By 2008, Jones had recorded five albums and one live DVD. After performing many shows and festivals throughout the world between 2009 and 2012, late in 2012 Keziah Jones was back in Lagos preparing to record his new studio album set for worldwide release on Because Music in 2013  Influences  Keziah often cites Fela Kuti, Miles Davis and Jimi Hendrix as important influences.  Art  Keziah Jones also draws, paints and writes poetry. He is a photographer and has produced short films, including one entitled BLACKSPEEDTEXT This film, his music and the other facets of his artistic life reflect his experiences on the streets.  Personal life  Keziah was married to Anglo-Nigerian singer Akure Wall in 1994. They separated in 1996. On 14 January 2012 Keziah married Hauwa Mukan, they separated in December 2013.

The award was founded by the bequest of Sir John Snell in a will made in 1677, although the original stipulation referred to the University of Oxford, rather than Balliol in particular. Snell died on 6 August 1679, but wrangling over the will meant that it was nearly twenty years before the first scholarships were awarded; the first four Snell Exhibitioners were admitted to Balliol in mid-1699. Snell had been a Royalist in the Civil War, and was later secretary to the Duke of Monmouth and had the management of his Scottish estates. He intended the bequest to be used to educate Scottish clergymen for the then-established Scottish Episcopal Church. By Adam Smith's day, the bequest was mostly regarded as an educational charity, though its exact status was not settled until later. \\"By the will of John Snell his exhibitors were under bond to take Anglican orders and return to Scotland, but the penalty was not enforced in the case of Adam Smith and numerous others.\\" (C. R. Fay, quoting The Times obituary of Smith.) Snell is buried in St Cross Church, which since 2011 has been Balliol's Special Collections Library being next to the college's graduate centre, Holywell Manor. Each year, there is an annual dinner held at Balliol and attended by delegates of Balliol, Glasgow and St John's College, Cambridge, in honour of the foundation.

(1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins .Mitchell, A. F. (1974). A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe. Collins Mitchell, A. F. (1982). The Trees of Britain and Northern Europe. Collins Description It is a medium-sized deciduous tree that grows to between ten and twenty metres tall, with a trunk up to sixty centimetres in diameter. The leaves are five to ten centimetres long and broad (rarely, up to 20 cm long and 12 cm broad), but, most typically, the leaves are approximately as broad as they are long. (Latifolia is the Latin word for 'broad-leaved'.) They are green above, downy with greyish-white hairs beneath, with six to ten small triangular teeth along each margin. The flowers are between one centimetre and 1.5 centimetres in diameter, with five creamy-white petals and yellowish stamens; they are produced in corymbs about eight centimetres in diameter in mid-spring. The fruit is a globular, dull brownish-red, pome of ten to twelve millimetres diameter, dotted with large pale lenticels, ripening in late autumn. Taxonomy The tree is of hybrid origin, between Sorbus torminalis (wild service tree) and a member of the Sorbus aria (whitebeam) group, but it exhibits apomixis and breeds true from seed. It was at one time thought to be a variety of Sorbus intermedia (Swedish whitebeam), and it was treated as such by some authors, such as A. P. de Candolle and J. C. Loudon, during the nineteenth century. Meanwhile, the horticulturalist, George Loddiges, whom Loudon held in high regard, labelled his arboretum trees at Abney Park Cemetery in 1840, as Sorbus latifolia, the currently-accepted binomial. Reflecting the considerable difference in opinion over the past two centuries as to its origins and identity, many synonyms have been used for the tree, including Crataegus latifolia Lam.; Pyrus latifolia (Lam.) Lindl.; P. intermedia var. latifolia (Lam.) D.C., and P. edulis Willd.Bean, W. J. (1980). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles 8th ed., vol. 4. John Murray . It is now placed in Karpatiosorbus. Cultivation and uses The service tree of Fontainebleau has occasionally been planted in ornamental contexts, or in arboretum schemes of woodland planting, or in gardens and parks, throughout Europe and North America, since its introduction into European horticulture about 1750. Since it is very fertile and grows true from seed, it has occasionally been able to naturalise in woodlands beyond its origins in the protected Fontainebleau woods, as at Abney Park Cemetery (an early Victorian garden cemetery in Stoke Newington, London). Although it is rare, the tree has been noted for several commercial uses. Its edible fruit was sold in open-air markets at Fontainebleau until the 1950s, and its homogeneous and long-lasting wood has proved to be valuable for certain uses.

The arcade owner would buy a base cabinet, while the games were stored on standard audio cassettes. The arcade owner would insert the cassette and a security dongle into the cabinet. When the cabinet was powered up, the program from the tape would be copied into the cabinet's RAM chips; this process took about two to three minutes. After this, the game could be played freely until the cabinet was rebooted. It was revolutionary for its time, but arcade owners complained about the potential unreliability of the cassettes (which could be demagnetized easily), as well as the medium's standard load times.http://www.atariprotos.com/deco/deco.htm Game list In bold characters are the video games that were also released in dedicated arcade cabinets. * 01: Highway Chase (also known as Mad Alien) * 02: Sengoku Ninja Tai (also known as Ninja) * 03: Manhattan * 04: Terranean * 05: Missile Sprinter * 06: Nebula * 07: Astro Fantasia * 08: The Tower * 09: Super Astro Fighter * 10: Ocean to Ocean * 11: Lock 'n' Chase * 12: The DECO Kid (also known as Flash Boy) * 13: Tournament Pro Golf (also known as Pro Golf or 18 Hole Pro Golf) * 14: DS Telejan * 15: Lucky Poker * 16: Treasure Island * 17: Bobitto * 18: Explorer * 19: Disco No. 1 (also known as Sweet Heart) * 20: Tornado * 21: Mission-X * 22: Pro Tennis * 23: 18 Challenge Pro Golf * 24: Tsumego Kaisyou * 25: Angler Dangler (also known as Fishing) * 26: BurgerTime (also known as Hamburger) * 27: Bump 'n' Jump (also known as Burnin' Rubber) * 28: Cluster Buster (also known as Graplop) * 29: Rootin' Tootin' (also known as La-Pa-Pa) * 30: Skater * 31: Pro Bowling * 32: Night Star * 33: Pro Soccer * 34: Super Doubles Tennis * 35: Bumpoline (also known as Flying Ball) * 36: Genesis (also known as Boomer Rang'r) * 37: Zeroize * 38: Scrum Try * 39: Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory * 40: Fighting Ice Hockey * 41: Oozumou - The Grand Sumo * 42: Hellow Gateball * 43: Kamikaze Cabbie (also known as Yellow Cab) * 44: Boulder Dash * UX-7: Tokyo MIE Shinryoujo (Tokyo MIE Clinic) * UX-8: Tokyo MIE Shinryoujo 2 (Tokyo MIE Clinic 2) * UX-9: Geinoujin Shikaku Shiken * ??: Burmazon See also * Nintendo VS.

It was owned by Career Education Corporation. The Bethpage campus served Nassau County, New York, and the Patchogue campus was in Suffolk County, New York. The college offered associate or bachelor programs. It stopped accepting new students in 2015 and closed in 2018,http://www.briarcliffe.edu/ citing financial difficulties, following a $10.25 million settlement with the New York state attorney general's office over inflated job placement rates in 2013. History Briarcliffe was founded in 1966, as a one-year business school in Hicksville, New York. A branch campus opened in 1969 in Mineola/Garden City. This branch was moved to Lynbrook, New York in 1983. In 1979, the New York State Education Department authorized Briarclffe to offer the two-year associate degree in occupational studies. A third campus was established in Patchogue, New York in 1981. In 1992, Briarcliffe, which had an overwhelmingly female student population, purchased Grumman Data Systems Institute, a technical school with a predominantly male enrollment. The combination of the two institutions created a coeducational college of approximately 2,000 students. The main campus was moved from Hicksville to the Grumman campus in Woodbury, New York. In 1994, the school was granted regional accreditation by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The college purchased a quarter-million square foot facility on approximately in Bethpage, New York in 1995. Students from the Lynbrook and Woodbury campuses were moved to this new main campus beginning with the fall semester in 1997. In 1996, Briarcliffe become regionally accredited and the school and faculty earned the right to be called Briarcliffe \\"College\\". One year later, the college became a 4-year college able to grant baccalaureate degrees. It was purchased by and is a subsidiary of Career Education Corporation. In 2010, the college offered its first degree programs fully online. Five years later, the college announced that it was no longer accepting new students and would be closed on December 31, 2018.

The company was established in 1955 by merging Renault heavy vehicle operations with Somua and Latil and disappeared in 1978 when was merged with former rival Berliet to form Renault V√©hicules Industriels. The company initially had various factories for vehicle production around France (mainly at the Paris area) which came from its predecessors and Chausson, but it soon centred assembly on Blainville-sur-Orne (trucks) and Annonay (buses and coaches). Saviem formed partnerships with other manufacturers, leading to technology- sharing agreements. History A Saviem SG2 =Early years= At the end of 1946, Renault abandoned the production of heavy trucks in view of its financial troubles, and the company lost the position of France's market leader which it had before World War II. However, the rapid development and production concentration on that sector made Renault to seek ways to enter into the market. In 1950, the Renault's technical chief, Fernand Picard, elaborated a plan to launch a limited range of trucks and buses with a single 105 CV engine, taking advantage of the economies of scale, which proved unsuccessful. In 1953, the strategy was changed and Renault decided to acquire rival manufacturers, starting with Somua and Latil. The company Saviem was formed in October 1955 by the merger of Renault's trucks and buses manufacturing operations with Somua and Latil and both Schneider (owner of Somua) and the Blum family (owner of Latil) had stakes in the new company. Initially, the Saviem name was added besides the existing badges of the three forming companies but, from 1957 onwards, Saviem-LRS appeared as marque's name on the company's products (the acronym representing the former marques Latil, Renault and Somua), which was simplified to Saviem in 1960. In 1959, Saviem became a whole-owned subsidiary of Renault. The early range of the company consisted of small commercial vehicles derived of Renault's existing models (Go√©lette and Galion), new medium and heavy trucks with Alfa Romeo engines and Chausson support for the coach/bus production. With an aggressive market approach focussed in volume rather than quality, Saviem became the leader by sales in France. =New vehicles and partnerships= During the early 1960s the company introduced a renovated JL heavy and medium duty trucks range with a revised design, new buses and coaches and, in 1964, a S range of medium duty trucks (with Renault and Perkins engines), unveiled at the Paris Motor Show. In January 1961, Saviem took control of the bus manufacturer Floirat, based at Annonay. That year, Saviem signed a cooperation agreement with Henschel-Werke. In 1962, Pierre Dreyfus decided to expand the European partnerships of Saviem and the company received a large capital amount from the French State for recapitalisation and modernisation. It also got the Limoges factory, which manufactured diesel engines. Between 1963 and 1966, Saviem moved most of its production from the Paris area to Blainville-sur-Orne and Annonay. In 1967, the Blainville-sur-Orne factory produced 26,000 large goods vehicles and the Annonay factory 1,777 buses/coaches. In 1965, Saviem acquired the French heavy equipment manufacturer Richard-Continental in a bid to compete with Caterpillar. From 1963 to 1977, Saviem cooperated with MAN of Germany (in 1967 such cooperation was expanded). As part of the agreement Saviem supplied cabs and in return MAN supplied axles and engines. The result of this was the launch of the SM (Saviem-MAN) and JM truck ranges in France. Renault also introduced the Super Galion, in partnership with Avia. In 1975 Saviem, together with DAF, Volvo and Magirus-Deutz (soon after to become a part of Iveco) became co-founder of the Club of Four cooperation to produce medium- sized trucks. The same year Saviem also acquired Sinpar and completed, together with Fiat and Alfa Romeo, the construction of a joint production facility for engines (Sofim) in Foggia, Italy, at a cost of . In January 1968, the main Saviem factory at Blainville-sur-Orne was the setting for one of the first workers' protests that led to the French May. =Merger with Berliet= As a result of companies' reorganisation and a French State decision of unifying the heavy vehicle production in France, in 1975 Renault also acquired the truck and bus manufacturer Berliet from the Michelin group. In 1978, Berliet and Saviem were merged to form Renault V√©hicules Industriels (RVI). Again, the old marque names were retained for two more years while the model lineups gradually were assimilated, and in April 1980 they were replaced by the name Renault, putting an end to the Saviem badging. In 1977, its last year as a separate company within Renault, Saviem manufactured 35,059 buses/coaches and trucks. Facilities , the Limoges factory is owned by thumb =V√©nissieux and Saint-Ouen= V√©nissieux and Saint-Ouen were Somua factories. V√©nissieux continued producing trucks until 1962. Saint-Ouen assembled engines until that activity was completely transferred to Limoges in 1964 and later auto parts. =Suresnes and Saint-Cloud= Suresnes and Saint- Cloud were Latil factories. Suresnes slowly ceased production but was kept as the head office and research and development base for the company. =Argenteuil= The Argenteuil factory was a former Chausson bus/coach facility operated by Saviem since 1960. It produced parts for both Saviem and Chausson. =Annonay= The coach/bus factory since 1961, originally part of Floirat and Isobloc. =Blainville-sur-Orne= Built in 1956 on the former Cahen shipyards, Blainville was the only truck factory owned by Saviem from 1966 onwards. =Limoges= In May 1964, the French government donated to Saviem the Limoges factory, a manufacturing facility for aircraft engine parts. Limoges became the main engine assembly location of the company. =Lyon= Saviem-owned Richard-Continental had two factories in Lyon.

It offered students programs leading to either a master's, bachelor's or associate's degree upon completion of the interior design, digital photography or communication design programs. Each program was credentialed with multiple levels of accreditation. The college was owned by Career Education Corporation. History The college traced its history to 1931 when Frances Harrington, a practicing interior designer, traveled to Chicago to provide a series of lectures for interior design professionals. She soon found a growing interest in the study of interior design and expanded her offerings by creating the Harrington Institute of Interior Design. As Harrington Institute grew, Harrington began providing diplomas to her qualified day division students. When she retired in 1959, her former student Robert Marks assumed leadership of the school. Marks added many programs and degree options to the school's curriculum. Changes in programs, which then under the guidance of the school's professional Advisory Board, were driven by input from the design industry's professional organizations.Online Education Database In 2003, Harrington Institute changed its name to Harrington College of Design after being purchased by Career Education Corporation, which proceeded to expand the school's design-related programs of study. The school moved to a new location at 200 W. Madison Street and mandated an annual 20% enrollment increase, which it were able to sustain for a few years until the economy faltered and then crashed in 2008. The campus at 200 W.

A local landmark, the bar is popular for its nightly live music, especially blues and bluegrass. Regular performers include Bobby Parker, Ben Andrews, Catfish Hodge, and Bob Perilla & Big Hillbilly Bluegrass. The bar offers billiards, has a rooftop deck and serves soul food. Notable regular patrons have included Euan Blair, son of Tony Blair, and the late Soviet dissident artist Alexandr Zhdanov.

Controversy Mural at Madam's Organ Blues Bar Madam's Organ features a large outdoor mural, which depicts \\"The Madam\\", the bar's burlesque mascot. The bar's owner, Bill Duggan, says he commissioned the mural as an artwork, but the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs ruled it an advertisement because it includes the name of the establishment. In court, the owner refused to remove the wording from the breasts, claiming that to do so would only further expose 9' by 13' breasts. Since Madam's Organ did not have a permit for the mural, the bar owner was fined. The case remains in the Court of Appeals.

It is located at the foot of Table Mountain in the Southern Suburbs of Cape Town, and is the wettest suburb in South Africa due to its high winter rainfall. It is home to a number of schools, including the oldest school in the country, South African College Schools (SACS) Junior and High Schools as well as Groote Schuur High School and Sans Souci Girls' High School. The neighborhood is also the location of a number of notable parks such as Newlands Forest and Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens. It is best known for Newlands Cricket Ground and Newlands Stadium, a rugby union and football venue. It is also the original home of Ohlsson's Cape Breweries, which is still located next to the rugby grounds. The original Ohlsson's Anneberg Brewery site is now location of the SACS schoolgrounds. The only remainder of the original brewery is the Josephine Mill, which used a water wheel to grind the grain for the brewery. This is now a historic monument. The pipeline from the Table Mountain spring which supplies the Newlands Brewery runs under the historic Cardiff Castle Building which is located in Newlands Village. The Liesbeek River runs through Newlands, past the Vineyard Hotel, and was the original water source used to make the first European-style beer in southern Africa. Friends of The Liesbeek maintain a walk along the river bank, past landmarks in the area. The distinctive southern half of Newlands, bordering the suburb Bishopscourt, is known as Fernwood, after a farm estate which used to occupy this area. The original manor house of this estate still exists, but is now used as a parliamentary sports club.http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SOUTH- AFRICA-CAPE-TOWN/2004-11/1099322238  Newlands spring  The fresh water springs in Newlands have played an important role in the development and history of the area. The springs are locally renowned for the high quality of the water they produce. It is still a popular practice for Capetonians to collect water at the springs. The main spring is located at the South African Breweries brewery on the corner of Main and Letterstead Road. A second popular spring was located on Kildare Road but was closed during the Cape Town water crisis in 2018 following a physical altercation between water collectors. Other reasons given for its closure by the municipality was that the council found water collection difficult to regulate at the site and due to complaints from locals about noise and traffic congestion. The water at the springs have played an important role in the brewing industry with South Africa's first licensed brewery being setup in the area at Papenboom in 1694. Water from the springs were also used to power water mills from the mid-1800s on wards.  Newlands Forest  Newlands Forest is incorporated within the Table Mountain National Park. The forest is a popular outdoor recreation area which includes surviving remnants of indigenous afro-temperate forest and endangered Granite Fynbos, as well as extensive pine plantations. There are also historic sites including the Woodcutter's Cottage and Lady Anne Barnard's Path. Newlands is home to the indigenous frog species Rose's ghost frog and sandellia, a tiny frog that lives in the waters of the Liesbeek river.

Cabral's letter said this was because the warrants are issued by a federal administrative worker not issued by a judge. Most of the sheriffs repudiated her suggestion and one of them released a notice through Fox they would continue to comply. On January 21, 2015 Governor Baker named Daniel Bennett as the new Secretary of the Executive Office for Public Safety and Security.

The Permian through Jurassic stratigraphy of the Colorado Plateau area of southeastern Utah that makes up much of the famous prominent rock formations in protected areas such as Capitol Reef National Park and Canyonlands National Park. From top to bottom: Rounded tan domes of the Navajo Sandstone, layered red Kayenta Formation, cliff-forming, vertically-jointed, red Wingate Sandstone, slope-forming, purplish Chinle Formation, layered, lighter-red Moenkopi Formation, and white, layered Cutler Formation sandstone. Picture from Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Utah. The Wingate Sandstone is a geologic formation in the Glen Canyon Group of the Colorado Plateau province of the United States which crops out in northern Arizona, northwest Colorado, Nevada, and Utah.  Geology  Wingate Sandstone is particularly prominent in southeastern Utah, where it forms attractions in a number of national parks and monuments. These include Capitol Reef National Park, the San Rafael Swell, and Canyonlands National Park. Wingate sandstone frequently appears just below the Kayenta Formation and Navajo Sandstone, two other formations of the Glen Canyon group. Together, these three formations can result in immense vertical cliffs of 2000 feet (609 meters) or more. Wingate layers are typically pale orange to red in color, the remnants of wind-born sand dunes deposited approximately 200 million years ago in the Late Triassic.  Fossils  Long dated to the Early Jurassic only, fossils (including a phytosaur skull) and other evidence indicate that part of the Wingate Sandstone is as old as Late Triassic in age. The upper part of the formation, which laterally interfingers with the Moenave Formation to the west, is Early Jurassic in age.Lucas, S. G., A. B. Heckert, J. W. Estep, and O. J. Anderson. 1997.

It runs in a north‚Äìsouth direction for from an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (US 9), NY 82, and NY 23 in Bell Pond to a junction with US 9 in Valatie. Most of the route is an easterly alternate route of US 9; however, the two routes cross near Valatie, and the northernmost mile of NY 9H runs west of US 9\\\\. NY 9H was assigned in the early 1930s to the part of its modern alignment south of Valatie. It was extended to its current length around the end of the 1930s.  Route description  NY 9H and NY 23 proceeding northward in Livingston just after the junction with US 9 and NY 82 NY 9H begins at a junction of three major Hudson Valley roadways, US 9, NY 23, and NY 82, in the Belle Pond section of Livingston. The route heads north through rural Livingston, overlapping with NY 23 as the road passes Belle Pond and farms as a two-lane road. It soon enters the town of Greenport, where NY 9H and NY 23 turn eastward and intersect with the southern terminus of County Route 29 (CR 29, named Spook Rock Road). The two roads enter the town of Claverack, crossing under power lines before bending northward through town. NY 9H and NY 23 remain mainly rural through the southern parts of Claverack, bending northward at a junction with CR 27 before entering the hamlet of Claverack. In Claverack, the two routes become residential before intersecting with the eastern terminus of NY 23B. At this junction, NY 23 turns eastward on NY 23B's continuation, while NY 9H continues north. NY 9H continues north through Claverack as a two-lane residential street, crossing CR 18 (Fish and Game Road) before turning to the northeast for a short stretch. The route remains rural for a short distance before entering the hamlet of Brick Tavern, where NY 9H intersects with NY 66 (Union Turnpike). NY 9H continues north through Brick Tavern, intersecting with the eastern segment of CR 20 and soon entering the Columbia County Airport area. Continuing north along the airport, NY 9H intersects with the western segment of CR 20, a former alignment and eastern terminus of NY 401\\\\. After leaving the airport area, NY 9H is now in the town of Ghent, passing Meadowgreens Golf Course before turning north into the hamlet of West Ghent. In West Ghent, the two- lane rural highway intersects with CR 22 before continuing into the town of Kinderhook. Signage for NY 9H's northern terminus at US 9 in Kinderhook In Kinderhook, NY 9H intersects with the western terminus of CR 25 before turning northeast near the Martin Van Buren National Historic Site. At Fischer Road, NY 9H turns northward once again, becoming a divided highway near CR 21 (Hudson Street) in Kinderhook. NY 9H bends to the northwest around the hamlet of Kinderhook before crossing US 9 (Kinderhook Street) once again in the town of Valatie. After crossing US 9, NY 9H passes west of Prospect Hill Cemetery and re-entering the town of Kinderhook. The route becomes a commercial strip for a short distance before ending at a roundabout with US 9. History NY 9H was assigned to the portion of its modern alignment south of US 9 southwest of Valatie. At the time, large parts of the road were being rebuilt as the highway had just been acquired by the state of New York sometime in the previous two years. By 1933, work had been completed on the part of NY 9H south of Union Turnpike (NY 66). The remainder of the route was an unimproved dirt road until . NY 9H was extended north around the western edge of Valatie to its current northern terminus . In May 1957, the Ghent School District lobbied the state to reduce the speed limit on NY 9H between NY 66 and CR 20\\\\. The district believed that the existing speed limit posed a danger to both children waiting for school buses and to members of the West Ghent Fire Department, located on NY 9H near NY 66\\\\. A specific speed limit was not suggested by the district at this time.

Early life and work Gerald Priestland was the son of (Joseph) Francis ('Frank') Edwin Priestland, Cambridge-educated publicity manager at Berkhamsted agricultural chemical business Cooper's (later Cooper, McDougall and Robertson- now part of GlaxoSmithkline), and a lieutenant in the Machine Gun Corps during the First World War, and Ellen Juliana, daughter of Colonel Alexander McWhirter Renny, of the 7th Bengal Lancers.Something Understood- An Autobiography, Gerald Priestland, Andre Deutsch Ltd, 1986, pp. 11-14 The owner of Cooper's was Frank Priestland's brother-in-law Sir Richard Ashmole Cooper, 2nd Baronet (married to his sister Alice).Something Understood- An Autobiography, Gerald Priestland, Andre Deutsch Ltd, 1986, pp. 11-12 Frank Priestland's father, Rev. Edward Priestland, was headmaster of Spondon House School in Derbyshire, having taken over from his father-in-law, Rev. Thomas Gascoigne.Something Understood- An Autobiography, Gerald Priestland, Andre Deutsch Ltd, 1986, p. 10 Gerald Priestland was educated at Charterhouse and New College, Oxford. He began his work at the BBC with a six-month spell writing obituary pieces for broadcast news. Indeed, he even jokingly wrote his own obituary shortly before leaving the job for a post as a sub-editor in the news gathering operation. In 1954, he became the youngest person (at 26 years) to work as a BBC foreign correspondent, having been sent by the controversial Editor of News, Tahu Hole, to the BBC's office in New Delhi. Between 1958 and 1961, Priestland was relocated to Washington, D.C. where he covered, among other things, the successful election of John F. Kennedy and the first US human spaceflight of Project Mercury. Following this, he spent most of the next four years as the BBC's Middle East correspondent, including covering the funeral of Jawaharlal Nehru, before requesting a transfer back to London as a television newsreader. BBC2 opening night Possibly Priestland's best known news broadcast occurred on the opening night of the BBC2 channel (Monday 20 April 1964). He had the onerous and unexpected task of anchoring the evening's transmission from the newsroom at Alexandra Palace as a consequence of an extensive power failure across London. The channel's output that evening was restricted to repeated readings of the news and apologies for the loss of normal service and only lasted for about three hours. Later life and work During the late 1960s, Priestland was back in the USA as chief American correspondent where he covered such events as the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the moon landing of the Apollo program and the outraged response of students to the Vietnam War. He returned to Britain at the end of the decade but his broadcasting duties were interrupted when he suffered a nervous breakdown. In the course of his recovery, Priestland became a devoted Quaker, despite having been a confirmed atheist in his youth. =Religious affairs= From the 1970s onward, he became increasingly involved in religious broadcasting and was the BBC's religious affairs correspondent from 1977 to 1982. His \\"Priestland's Postbag\\" was a controversial part of Terry Wogan's BBC breakfast programme, drawing both praise and criticism. During this period, he reported on both Papal Elections of 1978 and introduced a Saturday morning programme on BBC Radio 4 entitled Yours Faithfully. He gave the 1982 Swarthmore Lecture entitled, Reasonable Uncertainty: a Quaker approach to doctrine to the annual gathering of British Quakers. Priestland published his autobiography, Something Understood, in 1986, a work which he hastily altered before publication to express his true feelings about Tahu Hole, who had recently died: \\"He was a monster in every sense.\\" Priestland participated in a number of television and radio programmes for both the BBC and ITV until his death in 1991. After his death he received the rare honour (shared with John Reith, Huw Wheldon and Richard Dimbleby) of having a series of annually broadcast lectures named in his honour. He expressed his love of Cornwall in Postscript: with love to Penwith, published after his death.  Programmes  Priestland presented or featured on the following BBC programmes: * BBC2 news (television programme) as a newsreader *Sunday (radio programme) as a presenter *Analysis (radio programme) as a presenter - 1974 to 1975 *Yours Faithfully (radio programme) as a presenter *Priestland's Progress (radio programme) as a presenter \\\\- 1981 *Desert Island Discs (radio programme) as a guest castaway \\\\- 1984 *Radio Lives (radio programme) as the biography subject - 1995 Personal life On 14 May 1949, he married (Helen) Sylvia Rhodes (17 May 1924 - 14 January 2004), daughter of (Edward) Hugh Rhodes, C.B.E.,Who was Who: A Companion to Who's Who, A. & C.

The museum was founded in 1933 as the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences. In 1971, automotive heir, Walter P. Chrysler Jr. (whose wife, Jean Outland Chrysler, was a native of Norfolk), donated most of his extensive collection to the museum. This single gift significantly expanded the museum's collection, making it one of the major art museums in the Southeastern United States. From 1958 to 1971, the Chrysler Museum of Art was a smaller museum consisting solely of Chrysler's personal collection and housed in the historic Center Methodist Church in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Today's museum sits on a small body of water known as The Hague. Expansion and renovation The museum's main building underwent expansion and renovation and reopened on May 10, 2014. During the renovation, the Glass Studio and the Moses Myers House remained open and art was displayed at venues throughout the community. The museum's grand reopening included the Rubber Duck floating sculpture from May 17‚Äì26, 2014. The museum originally had a courtyard, but during renovations in the 1980s, the courtyard was enclosed, creating Huber Court. Concerts and events are held in Huber Court. Collection The New York Times described the Chrysler collection as \\"one any museum in the world would kill for.\\" Comprising over 30,000 objects, the collection spans over 5,000 years of world history. American and European paintings and sculpture from the Middle Ages to the present day form the core of the collection. The museum's most significant holdings include works by Tintoretto, Veronese, Peter Paul Rubens, Diego Vel√°zquez, Salvator Rosa, Gianlorenzo Bernini, John Singleton Copley, Thomas Cole, Eug√®ne Delacroix, √âdouard Manet, Paul C√©zanne, Gustave Dor√©, Albert Bierstadt, Auguste Rodin, Mary Cassatt, Paul Gauguin, Georges Rouault, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Edward Hopper, Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Richard Diebenkorn, Karen LaMonte and Franz Kline. The Chrysler Museum is home to the final sculpture of the Baroque master Gianlorenzo Bernini, a marble bust of Jesus Christ created as a gift for the artist's benefactor, Queen Christina of Sweden. The Museum also houses one of the world's greatest collections of glass (including outstanding works by Louis Comfort Tiffany), distinguished holdings in the decorative arts, and a fine and growing collection of photography. The arts of the ancient world, Asia, Africa, and Pre-Columbian America (particularly Maya ceramics) are also well represented. Programs and exhibitions The Chrysler Museum provides guided tours, lectures, films, concerts, family days, travel programs, and publications. Each year, over 100 Volunteer Docents welcome over 60,000 students from Hampton Roads' schools for tours at the museum. The Chrysler displays its permanent collection, and several changing exhibitions including works from around the globe. Recent offerings include Rembrandt's Etchings: The Embrace and Darkness of Light, From Goya to Sorolla: Masterpieces from The Hispanic Society of America, To Conserve a Legacy: American Art from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Rodin: Sculpture from the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Collection and American Chronicles: The Art of Norman Rockwell. Jean Outland Chrysler Library The Jean Outland Chrysler Library is one of the largest art libraries in the South. The collection covers the entire history of world art, with special emphasis on material relevant to the Chrysler's permanent collection. The library subscribes to several hundred art-related journals, has an extensive collection of current and historical auction catalogues, and exchanges publications with 400 art museums around the world. The library is named in honor of Jean Outland Chrysler, wife of the late Walter P. Chrysler, Jr., who played a leading role in its formation and expansion. The collection is based on the original holdings of the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences library. In 1977, the library of the London art dealer M. Knoedler & Co. was purchased, adding major historical reference volumes, periodicals, and rare annotated sales catalogues. The library also houses the museum's archives, which includes Mark Twain's original typescript of a speech he delivered at the Jamestown Tricentennial Exposition of 1907, and a collection of papers from the Moses Myers family provides unique insights into the life of an important Tidewater merchant during the United States' early history. The Jean Outland Chrysler Library moved from the Chrysler Museum of Art into a new art building on Old Dominion University campus in 2014. Historic houses In addition to its main building in downtown Norfolk, the Chrysler Museum of Art administers two important historic houses. =Moses Myers House= The Moses Myers House in downtown Norfolk is an example of Federal period architecture and retains 70 percent of its original contents. The house and its furnishings allow visitors to experience first-hand the life of a prosperous Jewish merchant and his family during the early 19th century. Moses Myers moved to Norfolk in 1787 with his wife Eliza. Five years later, he purchased a large lot where he erected a home for his family. Today the house contains an important collection of American, English and French furniture, glass, silver, ceramics, and portraits by Gilbert Stuart, Thomas Sully, and John Wesley Jarvis. All were commissioned or acquired by members of the Myers family. The house was built about 1792 and is a two-story, Federal style brick townhouse. Its facade features a pedimented gable end roof and a small aedicula type portico surrounding the front door. In 1796, a two-story octagonal ended wing attributed to Benjamin H. Latrobe was added to the rear of the house to contain a large dining room. Also on the rear are a two-story service wing and an attached two-story kitchen. A historic renovation of the house occurred in 1906 in anticipation of the Jamestown Exposition. The house was converted to a house museum in 1931. and Accompanying five photos It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, with an amendment made in 2009. =Norfolk History Museum at the Willoughby-Baylor House= The Norfolk History Museum at the Willoughby-Baylor House at the newly refurbished Willoughby-Baylor House (ca. 1794) illuminates the history of the region by providing thematic offerings and surveys including the decorative arts of Norfolk, the story of Norfolk at stages in its history as an international port and maritime center, and the area's naval and military heritage.

The film is set during World War II and regards a group of Italian soldiers who become stranded on a Greek island in the Aegean Sea, and are left behind by the war. It won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1992. Plot In 1941, one year after Italy joined Germany against the Allies in World War II, a small group of misfit Italian soldiers is sent to a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea for four months of lookout duty. The soldiers include a lieutenant who likes art, a macho sergeant, a ski instructor accompanied by his beloved donkey Silvana, and other quirky people. They are not very good soldiers, but a cross section of average, independent men. The soldiers anticipate attack from outside and on the island, and take all sorts of inept precautions. They find a small town with no people. That night, they see bombing on the horizon and by radio interception, discover that the ship that was intended to pick them up has been destroyed. Mysteriously, people reappear in the village: the villagers say they hid because the Germans had taken all the men, but having seen that the Italians are absolutely harmless they have decided to return to their lives. It's not long before everyone's sunny nature appears. The Italian soldiers, unacquainted with a war they clearly do not sense as theirs, are absorbed into the life, heat and landscape of the idyllic island. The local orthodox priest asks the lieutenant, an amateur painter, to restore the murals in his church. Two soldiers, who are brothers, befriend a lovely young woman, a shepherdess. They eventually consummate their friendship with the shepherdess who in turn - loves them both equally. Sergeant Lo Russo, the only member of the crew with a fiery spirit for war, takes up folk dancing & begins to reflect on his place in the universe. Meanwhile, the shyest soldier, Farina, falls in love with the island's prostitute, named Vasilissa. In their old age, three of the men are reunited on the islandMediterraneo (1991). March 22, 1992.

Release Mediterraneo was released in Italy on 31 January 1991 by Penta Distribuzione before premiering at the 1991 Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 1991, where its North American distribution rights were purchased by Miramax Films. Internationally, the film was truncated by 10 minutes, resulting in an 86-minute cut. The film was submitted as the Italian entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in November 1991. It was released in the United States in March 1992, a week before the Academy Awards and made its worldwide run over the next two years. =Box office= The film grossed $4.5 million in the United States and Canada, and was the highest- grossing non-English language film at the US box office that year but was later surpassed by Indochine which was released at Christmas 1992 and grossed most of its revenue in 1993. =Critical response= Mediterraneo was received positively by critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 79% score, based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 6.33/10. In 1996, Roger Ebert stated that this was the only film he ever walked out of because it was \\"utterly without redeeming merit\\". =Awards= It won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1992. Criticism The film has been criticised for its portrayal of the Royal Italian Army during World War II because it employs a comparable story arc to the Clean Wehrmacht myth that developed in post-war Germany. This was the belief that the Heer was noble and apolitical, unlike the National Socialists and the SS. The film uses the post-war Italian Republic narrative that \\"Italians are decent people\\" (Italiani, brava gente), compared to the ideologically-motivated and brutal Germans who persecuted and murdered Jews and other ethnic groups throughout occupied Europe. Modern historians have now challenged this narrative: research has shown the \\"gentle Italians\\" belief was created to avoid \\"a public debate on collective responsibility, guilt and denial, repentance and pardon\\" for the Italian Army's actual historical conduct and behaviour during the Second World War.

The company was founded in 1891 by William Sutton and Emil Alexander, who had previously founded the Laclede Car Company in 1883 also in St. Louis, and had both got their start working in the streetcar business at St. Louis' horsecar manufacturer, the Brownell Car Company. The American Car Company was a builder of electric powered streetcars. ACC was bought out by the J. G. Brill Company of Philadelphia in 1902. However, Brill continued to operate the American Car Co. under its own name until 1931, when it was reorganized as J. G. Brill of Missouri. In 1915, American Car built the very first Birney-type trolley, the prototype of a new design then known as the \\"Safety Car\\", and went on to build more Birney cars than any other manufacturer. The Fort Collins Municipal Railway, in Colorado, and the Fort Smith Trolley Museum, in Arkansas, are examples of operations where preserved Birney cars built by the American Car Company can still be seen running today. In 1931, only four months after parent company J. G. Brill discontinued use of the American Car Company name, the ex-ACC factory in St. Louis closed permanently.

The main area code, 601, was one of the original area codes implemented in 1947, and covered the entire state of Mississippi. Despite the state's relatively stagnant population growth, 601 was close to exhaustion by the mid-1990s due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. Additionally, the Memphis LATA extends for some distance into northern Mississippi, so several numbers in Memphis' area code 901 weren't available for use. In 1997, the far southeastern tip of the state, including Biloxi and the Gulf Coast, was split off as area code 228. In 1999, area code 662 was created in the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi side of the Memphis area. The 1999 split was intended as a long-term solution, but within five years 601 was close to exhaustion due to the proliferation of cell phones, particularly in the Jackson area. In 2006, Mississippi's first overlay area code, 769, was approved for use to overlay 601. Ten-digit dialing became mandatory in central Mississippi later that year.

Walker was born to Unitarian parents in London, the twenty-first child of John Walker by his second wife, Elizabeth. He was educated at a school in Barnard Castle. He was introduced to the Society of Friends in his teenage years when he worked in Newcastle for a linen draper who was a Quaker, but Walker did not become a Quaker himself until 1827. Walker also participated in the temperance movement. Walker met his future missionary partner James Backhouse in 1820 or 1821. Between September 1831 and February 1832, Walker and Backhouse travelled from England to Hobart, Van Diemen's Land (modern Tasmania). Between 1832 and 1838, they made a tour of the penal settlements in Australia, Van Diemen's Land, and Norfolk Island. Between 1838 and 1840, they left Australia and did missionary work in Mauritius and South Africa. In 1840, Walker ended his travels. He returned to Hobart in September and was married to Sarah Benson Mather on 15 December 1840. He set up a business as a draper, and, in 1844, helped establish the Hobart Savings Bank which eventually became the Trust Bank. He worked at his business and for the Quakers and temperance until he died on 2 February 1859 in Hobart. In 1994, the Hobart Savings Bank endowed a scholarship at the University of Tasmania named the \\"George Washington Walker Trust Bank Perpetual Undergraduate Scholarship\\"; it was to be awarded to students of commerce or economics. His eldest son was James Backhouse Walker.

History Wooden bridge at R√ºegsau R√ºegsau is first mentioned in 1139 as Ruxow. In 1229 it was mentioned as Ruchisowe. The name comes from ruggere aue, in modern German ruhe Aue, meaning calm floodplain. From the late 13th century until 1528 it was the location of R√ºegsau Priory, a Benedictine nunnery. The oldest trace of a settlement is a neolithic artifact discovered in R√ºegsau village. The first trace of a modern settlement is in the first half of the 12th century when R√ºegsau Abbey was probably founded. While very little is known about the early history of the Abbey, it was probably founded by Th√ºring von L√ºtzelfl√ºh around the same time that he founded Trub Abbey. It is unknown whether the village grew up around the Abbey or was already here when the Abbey was founded. The first known provost appears in the abbey in 1256-99. There was a Meisterin over the nuns in 1320 and an abbess is first mentioned in 1526-28. The Abbey ruled over a section of the lower Emmental including R√ºegsau and Affoltern im Emmental. In 1454 it had its own seal. In 1528 the city of Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and in the same year secularized all monasteries including R√ºegsau Abbey. Its goods were used to provide income for the priests of R√ºegsau and L√ºtzelfl√ºh, and part of the buildings was used to provide a priest's house. The remaining buildings were gradually dismantled: the last traces of the walls were removed between 1825 and 1831. The priory church became the village church. It was renovated in 1789-1790 and extended in 1874. Further renovations took place in 1947, 1990 and 1999. In 1763 a wooden, covered bridge was built over the Emme river connecting Hasle bei Burgdorf and R√ºegsau. In 1881 the Burgdorf-Langnau railroad built a station in Hasle- R√ºegsau. The railroad combined with the expansion of the Emmental road in 1899, brought factories to the formerly rural village. Today the services sector has surpassed industry, but agriculture and manufacturing are still an important part of the local economy.

It belongs to the missionary Ottilien Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. History The monastery developed from a place of pilgrimage founded in 1720, to the honour of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. At first there was only a small chapel with a hermitage, but in view of the growing popularity of the site it was already being proposed in the 19th century that a monastery should be founded here in order to look after it. The first monks, who were Trappists, did not however arrive until 1921. The Generalate of the order had decreed the dissolution of the community as early as 1930, and this eventually took place in 1949. Between 1951 and 1960 the monastery accommodated the novitiate of the East German province of the Jesuits. With the troubles in Africa of the 1960s many of the missionary orders found themselves obliged to withdraw their brothers from the crisis areas, to forestall their expulsion. For this reason the Ottilien Congregation acquired the buildings on the Jakobsberg at the end of the 1960s, and the first group of monks moved in on 31 January 1961.

As the name suggests, it is set up as a technical school, with trades training and special shops for auto repair, carpentry etc. Danforth was built as a specialist technical school in 1922, so it has a number of specialist areas and a fair stock of equipment. It is a part of the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). Prior to 1998 it was within the Toronto Board of Education (TBE).\\"Secondary Schools.\\" () Toronto Board of Education. November 12, 1997. Retrieved on July 23, 2013. Attached to Danforth is the Toronto Urban Studies Centre, an outdoor educational school. The school's motto is \\"Faciendo Discimus,\\" which means \\"We learn by doing.\\"  History  Originally existed in 1912 as Riverdale Branch Technical School, the building has been added to many times since it was founded in 1923, and there are sections of the school built in almost every decade of the twentieth century. Danforth has a maze-like basement. At least one basement level is permanently sealed to students creating a number of rumours about what might be down there (including a connection to the subway that runs under the school, a rifle range, and a bomb shelter). The sub-basement does in fact host the school's active Cadet Corps and National Defence course. According to the current principal the range is still mostly intact. The school has three gyms, which is remarkable in a Toronto public school, and a large 1920s auditorium which is occasionally used in films. Additional facilities include a weight room, and a swimming pool. The main school fa√ßade is Collegiate Gothic was designed by architect C.E. Cyril Dyson.https://www.acotoronto.ca/show_building.php?BuildingID=11173 In 1932, Riverdale Tech was renamed to Danforth Technical School. It was renamed to Danforth Collegiate and Technical Institute several years later. Danforth is known for having sent more of its students and staff to the Second World War than any other school in Canada, and has a large stained-glass window in the library to act as its war memorial. During World War II, the facilities of Danforth were used for Combined Operations Headquarters training. On April 25, 2012, a 3-alarm fire occurred at the school. The fire began in the school's drama studio, and quickly spread to the adjacent music room. As of April 28, it is speculated that the cause of the blaze was arson; an investigation is currently being held by Toronto police. Danforth is near other secondary schools (East York Collegiate Institute and Monarch Park Collegiate Institute) and is not at capacity, A number of specialist programs are held there, including the Gifted and Enriched programs, special classes for students with disabilities (including a special program for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing) and a number of specialist technical courses, such as the Math, Science, and Technology (\\"MaST\\") program. As a result, Danforth draws students from a wider area of the city than most other secondary schools Since Danforth's facilities can hold up to 2,130 pupils, the school is under enrolled with 879 students as of {2015}. The school became the subject of the Pupil Accommodation Review Committee set by the TDSB in November 2015. Following the closure of Scarborough's surviving technical school, Bendale Business and Technical Institute in June 2019, it is expected that Danforth will accept students residing in Scarborough whose pursuing careers in trade skills. Greenwood Secondary School In 2017, students from Greenwood Secondary School moved from 24 Mountjoy Avenue to its present location at 800 Greenwood Avenue but will retain their separate school identity.http://greenwoodsecondary.com/?m=201706  Events  Danforth's Student Council a holds an annual Grade 9 Day, a fun filled day planned for the incoming grade 9's, at the beginning of the year. Grade 9 Day often consists of 9 stations, each hosted by one of the 9 Student Council members. Danforth Collegiate hosts a Winter Holiday Show and Market Place which usually occurs the week before the winter break. Danforth's different departments often make holiday presents to sell as a fundraiser. The Drama, Music and Dance department put on the Holiday Show.

Their repertoire included such popular songs as \\"Mood Indigo,\\" \\"Mandy,\\" \\"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye,\\" and \\"Lord, If I Get My Ticket.\\":239 By 1951, the group had become much in-demand on campus for singing engagements, and they were also enthusiastically received by audiences when on tour with the Glee Club.:239 The early 1950s were a busy and tumultuous period, as the young group had inadvertently stumbled onto an entirely new and growing collegiate phenomena, the small a capella singing group. As Michael Slon ('92) wrote in his book Songs From The Hill ‚Äî A History Of The Cornell Glee Club: > Prior to the Waiters, the regimen of small group singing, traveling, and > recording, completely familiar today, did not exist at Cornell.

In 1956, the Waiters decided they could no longer split their efforts between choral and small group singing, and permanently dissociated from the Glee Club. Despite the shock of disassociation, both organizations went on to enjoy enormous success throughout the remainder of the 20th century. = Independent History (1956‚Äì2017) =  Spring Fever Concert  In 1974, The Waiters performed their first annual \\"Spring Fever\\" concert. The Waiters performed this show annually until 2016. The show was mentioned on various blogs, including Slope Media, which described the show as \\"taking [...] A Cappella to another level.\\" In the early 1990s, the Waiters added a December Holiday Show to their yearly concert repertoire. The Holiday Show was performed every December through the 2000s.  \\"We Didn't Go To Harvard\\"  In 1990, The Waiters wrote and performed \\"We Didn't Go To Harvard,\\" a parody of Billy Joel's \\"We Didn't Start The Fire.\\" The song has received over 152,000 views on YouTube, and has inspired other college singing groups to create their own parodies based on Billie Joel's 1989 #1 hit song.
