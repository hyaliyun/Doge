Mathis hints at the theme for this album in the liner notes for his 1993 box set The Music of Johnny Mathis: A Personal Collection, where he gives his thoughts on the 1964 Little Anthony and the Imperials song \\"I'm on the Outside Looking In\\" that he covered for his 1988 album Once in a While: \\"That was group singers' kind of material. I was singing other stuff. It wasn't the picture of the lone crooner standing in the spotlight. That's what I was doing when all this other stuff was going on.

Reception Although the album did not make it onto Billboard magazine's Top Pop Albums chart, it did receive praise in People magazine, where the reviewer remarks that Mathis and the album producers \\"make these songs sound reconsidered, not merely recycled.\\" It's also noted that \\"Mathis's ability to extract every last nuance from a lyric has never been employed to better advantage\\" and that \\"Take 6's presence enables him to prove that he can keep up with the younger generation.\\" The album also received a positive retrospective review from Allmusic, where Bil Carpenter wrote, \\"Clean, uncomplicated orchestration\\" and \\"One of Mathis's best recordings to date.\\" Track listing Recording dates From the liner notes for The Voice of Romance: The Columbia Original Album Collection: *May 1988–December 1988 – \\"All Alone Am I\\", \\"The End of the World\\", \\"Since I Don't Have You\\", \\"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\\", \\"True Love Ways\\", \\"You Belong to Me\\" *July 27, 1988 – \\"For Your Love\\", \\"In the Still of the Night\\", \\"It's All in the Game\\", \\"Since I Fell for You\\" Personnel From the liner notes for the original album: *Johnny Mathis – vocals *Peter Bunetta – producer *Rick Chudacoff – producer *Jay Landers – executive producer *Cedric Dent – arranger (background vocals) *Mervyn Warren – arranger (background vocals) *Gary Brandt – recording engineer *Marc Ettel – recording engineer *Daren Klein – recording engineer *Frank Wolf – recording engineer *Mick Guzauski – mixing engineer * Mixed at Conway Studios, Hollywood, California *Bernie Grundman – mastering engineer *Mastered at Bernie Grundman Mastering, Hollywood, California *Don Adey – assistant engineer (Alpha) *Bryant Arnett – assistant engineer (Conway) *Kristen Connolly – assistant engineer (Smoketree) *Richard McKernan – assistant engineer (Conway) *Marnie Riley – assistant engineer (Conway) *Steve Satkowski – assistant engineer (Alpha) *24 Collection, Bal Harbour – wardrobe *Kyle Plyer – styling *Deev – grooming *Rebecca Chamlee Keeley – art direction *David Vance – photographer =Musicians = *Garrett Adkins – trombone *Rick Braun – trumpets *Peter Bunetta – drums *Sonny Burke – organ *Alvin Chea (Take 6) – background vocals; featured vocals (\\"In the Still of the Night\\", \\"It's All in the Game\\") *Rick Chudacoff – bass *Brad Cole – keyboards *Cedric Dent (Take 6) – background vocals; featured vocals (\\"In the Still of the Night\\", \\"It's All in the Game\\") *Bill Elliott – keyboards *Melvin Franklin – background vocals *Mara Getz – background vocals *John Helliwell – clarinet and tenor sax *Dann Huff – guitar *Mark Kibble (Take 6) – background vocals; featured vocals (\\"In the Still of the Night\\", \\"It's All in the Game\\") *Darrell Leonard – trumpet *Claude McKnight III (Take 6) – background vocals; featured vocals (\\"In the Still of the Night\\", \\"It's All in the Game\\") *Doug Norwine – tenor sax *Jimmy Roberts – tenor sax *Amy Shulman – harp *Leslie Smith – background vocals *David Thomas (Take 6) – background vocals; featured vocals (\\"In the Still of the Night\\", \\"It's All in the Game\\") *Mervyn Warren (Take 6) – background vocals; featured vocals (\\"In the Still of the Night\\", \\"It's All in the Game\\") *David Woodford – baritone sax and flute References Bibliography  * Category:1989 albums Category:Johnny Mathis albums Category:Columbia Records albums ","title":"In the Still of the Night (album)"},{"id":"42409160","text":"Riverview Cemetery is a historic cemetery on North Market Street in Wilmington, Delaware. The cemetery consists of two sections, on either side of North Market Street. The southern section consists of a long, roughly rectangular plot that was purchased in 1872, when the cemetery was founded. The landscaping of this area was designed by Herman J. Schwarzmann, and is the only known example of his work in the state. In 1899 the cemetery's size was doubled by the acquisition of a trapezoidal parcel on the north side of North Market Street. This section was laid out by the cemetery's superintendent, Goldsmith C. Nailor. The northern section is the location of the state's first community mausoleum, a Classical Revival structure built in 1917 to a pattern design by the American Mausoleum Company of Clyde, Ohio. The cemetery was founded and established by a consortium of Wilmington fraternal and social organizations as the Riverview Cemetery Company. Today, it is owned and operated by the Friends of Historic Riverview Cemetery. The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

The painting is Arcimboldo's most famous work and is a portrait of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II re-imagined as Vertumnus, the Roman god of metamorphoses in nature and in life. The fruits and vegetables symbolize the abundance of the Golden Age that has returned under the Emperor's rule. Arcimboldo also used many of the pictured fruits (grape clusters, a mulberry, pear, apples, squash, cucumber, cabbage and cherries) because they are the first fruits of the season (again referring to Vertumnus). Additionally, Arcimboldo chose these foods because he drew much of his inspiration from Sextus Propertius' elegies. The painting is part of the collection at Skokloster Castle in Sweden. Painting The portrait of the emperor is created out of plants – flowers and fruits from all seasons: gourds, pears, apples, cherries, grapes, wheat, artichokes, beans, peas, corns, onions, cabbage foils, chestnuts, figs, mulberries, plums, pomegranates, various pumpkin and olives. Rudolf's portrait, composed of fruit, vegetables, and flowers, symbolized the perfect balance and harmony with nature that his reign represented. These portraits were an expression of the Renaissance mind's fascination with riddles, puzzles, and the bizarre. Arcimboldo's traditional religious subjects were later forgotten, but his portraits of human heads composed of objects were greatly admired by his contemporaries.\\"Giuseppe Arcimboldo\\", SK Kloster Slott.se.

It draws upon both the British Armed Forces and the French Armed Forces to field a deployable force with land, air and maritime components together with command and control and supporting logistics. It is distinct from the similarly named UK Joint Expeditionary Force.  Background  The Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (or CJEF) is envisaged as a deployable, combined Anglo-French military force for use in a wide range of crisis scenarios, up to and including high intensity combat operations. As a joint force it involves all three armed services: a land component composed of formations at national brigade level, maritime and air components with their associated headquarters, together with logistics and support functions. The CJEF is not conceived as a standing force; instead, is available at short notice for UK-French bilateral, NATO, European Union, United Nations or other operations. Combined air and land exercises commenced during 2011 with a view towards developing a full capability. The CJEF is also seen as a potential stimulus towards greater interoperability and coherence in military doctrine, training and equipment requirements. The UK and French defence ministries have jointly produced a User Guide (in English) to assist military staff operating at the operational and higher tactical levels of CJEF operations. This guide, jointly developed by the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre at Shrivenham, UK, and the Centre Interarmées de Concepts, de Doctrine et d'Expérimentations in Paris, has been published on the French Ministry of Defence website.Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF) User Guide, http://www.cicde.defense.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/20121218_np_cicde_dcdc_cjef-user- guide.pdf  History and development  In 2010, the governments of the UK and France signed the Lancaster House Treaties which committed both governments to the creation of an Anglo-French Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF). This was outlined as follows: In 2012, the UK-France Summit revealed further information on the CJEF. The two governments reaffirmed their commitments, stating that their recent expeditionary operations in Libya had proven the CJEF's relevance. It was announced that the CJEF would be operational from 2016 and that it would be \\"an early entry force capable of facing multiple threats up to the highest intensity\\". The two governments also agreed to continue the development of a joint maritime task group force which would be available by 2020 and comprise maritime assets owned by both countries. A joint exercise, named Exercise Corsican Lion, was also announced to test and further develop the CJEF, which subsequently took place in October 2012. In 2013, a large-scale joint amphibious exercise in the Red Sea, named Exercise Djibouti Lion, was cancelled. British Defence Minister Mark Francois stated that it was cancelled due to \\"administrative issues\\" and not due to a lack of resources as the media had reported. During the 2014 UK-France Summit, both governments announced that \\"good progress\\" was being made on the delivery of the CJEF. The creation of an integrated national Joint Task Force Headquarters was announced, as well as a Combined Logistics Support Group to sustain the CJEF. Two major exercises to take place in 2015 and 2016 were also announced. In April 2016, Exercise Griffin Strike began to take place in the UK involving up to 5,000 personnel. It was dubbed the CJEF's \\"biggest development test\\" by the UK Ministry of Defence and involved land, air and sea components. Typhoon fighters of the Royal Air Force and Rafale fighters of the French Air Force were deployed to RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire. At sea, Royal Navy ships, including , and , combined with French Navy ships, including the , and . On land, elements of the British Army’s 3rd (UK) Division and the French Army's 7th Mechanised Brigade, including paratroopers, armoured units and infantrymen, came together.  Structure of CJEF  =Role= The CJEF comprises strategic, operational and tactical level Command and Control elements, together with deployable sea, land, air and logistical components. It is seen as being able to conduct offensive and defensive operations on land, in the air, and at sea. It is designed to be rapidly deployable and, once ready in theatre, to be sustainable for up to three months of operations as a stand-alone force; as well as having the ability to include other nations as coalition partners. The UK and France see the following as the most likely tasks for the CJEF: * crisis management, involving early entry into a potentially hostile territory (including the initial enforcement of no-fly zones, embargoes and sanctions); * the protection of shared national interests abroad; * extraction operations; * non-combatant evacuation operations; * the temporary strengthening of a peacekeeping operation; * support to emergency humanitarian assistance. = Command & Control = At the strategic level Command and Control (C2) is exercised via a CJEF Current Commitments Team (CCT) which takes its direction jointly from the UK's Chief of the Defence Staff and France's Chef d’État Major des Armées. The CJEF CCT provides strategic military direction to the CJEF Operational Headquarters (OHQ) which, depending on circumstances, is to be based either in the UK at PJHQ Northwood or in France at Fort Mont-Valérien. The OHQ carries out operational level planning with the conduct of the operation being commanded by the deployed tactical headquarters the Combined Joint Force Headquarters (CJFHQ). The C2 arrangements are summarised as follows: * Strategic level – CJEF Current Commitments Team (CCT) * Operational level – CJEF Operational Headquarters (OHQ) * Tactical level – deployable Combined Joint Force Headquarters (CJFHQ), and as required: # Combined Logistics Support Group (CLSG) headquarters. # Maritime component commander. # Land component commander. # Air component commander. = Deployable Components = The CJEF is planned to be able to deploy maritime, land, and air components with the CJFHQ commanding these either directly or via individual component commanders. * A maritime component of up to a naval task group based on one or more capital ships, with the maritime forces required to conduct a particular CJEF operation being primarily depend on the circumstances. The component may include any combination of UK and French maritime assets gathered in a task group, and commanded from a UK/French combined headquarters that could be led by either nation. * A scalable land component of at least a UK battle-group and a French battle-group. It is to be capable of conducting non-enduring, complex intervention operations, facing multiple threats up to high intensity. It is planned as a high-readiness force using existing national high readiness force elements – including lead elements at very short notice. * An air component comprising an expeditionary air wing that is self-sufficient and capable of being generated within 10 days of activation. This will include all air assets across the full spectrum of air power roles. It is envisaged that the air component will be able to deliver the full spectrum of air effects. * A logistics component with which the UK and France envisage collaborating to share the logistics support of the CJEF. Cooperative logistic planning is foreseen as commencing at the earliest opportunity and logistic operations will typically be commanded by a Combined Logistics Support Group headquarters, subordinate to the CJTF headquarters.  Relationship to European Union Defence Policy  While the CJEF may, with both French and UK government agreement, be used for European Union (EU) tasks it is not formally part of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy. It does not use the separate Lisbon Treaty’s Permanent Structured Cooperation facility, nor involve the European Defence Agency.

Russians populate various regions, but mostly in those regions which had been under direct Russian military occupation in the past, thus in Russia's sphere of influence. This was an indirect result of the outcome of the last Russo- Persian Wars.Russia and Iran, 1780-1828 U of Minnesota Press, 1 mei 1980 p 160 Nowadays there are Russians located in the southern regions of the country as well (such as Bushehr), where many of them work as technicians and nuclear experts, on for example the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant. Although the community has shrunk significantly since the Second World War, the following Iran crisis of 1946 and the Iranian Revolution, Russians are known to be living in Iran since the time of the Safavids. History Russians in Iran (Persia) have a long history dating back many centuries.Russian travellers in Iran to 1917 - IranicaonlineRussia-Iran relations \\"RUSSIA i. Russo-Iranian Relations up to the Bolshevik Revolution\\" However, the first mass-immigration of Russians into Iran occurred in the early 20th century when hundreds of thousands of White émigrés had to flee from the Bolsheviks. Most of them landed in the north Iranian provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran, but also in the northwest and northeast, in Iranian Azerbaijan and Khorasan, where communities of their descendants still live. The Russian community kept increasing in the northern provinces of the country, as a result of the Russian sphere of influence which was established since the Russo-Persian War of 1826-28. This influence ended some decades later with the crisis of 1946. Russian Orthodoxy The Russian Church of Qazvin The once numerous Russian Orthodox community in Iran has shrunken over the years.

Personal life  Leighton Aspell was born 12 June 1976 in Dublin, Ireland. He grew up in Narraghmore, County Kildare. Aspell has a brother, Paddy, who is also a jockey, and was originally taught to ride by his father, Patrick. He was later apprenticed to Reg Hollinshead. Aspell has a fan club, making him \\"one of the few jockeys\\" to have such a thing. He and his brother Paddy are second cousins of former Ireland Rugby international Shane Horgan and his actress sister Sharon Horgan.  Career  Aspell has competed in seven Grand Nationals, winning both the 2014 and 2015 Grand Nationals and coming second in the 2003 Grand National (his debut), riding Supreme Glory. Aspell had several other notable successes. He won the Welsh National on Supreme Glory in 2001 and the same race on L'Aventure in 2005. Also, in 2005, Aspell won the Grade I Champion Four Year Old Hurdle at Punchestown Racecourse on the Lucy Wadham-trained mare United. In 2006, Aspell came near to victory at the Grand National, riding Ballycassidy, but he fell at Valentine's Brook second time round. In July 2007, Aspell announced his retirement from race riding, and left to work for trainer John Dunlop in Arundel. However, he began his comeback in April 2009, saying > \\"I'm really looking forward to coming back. It's something that has been in > the back of my mind, and the more I thought about it, the more I decided > that I didn't want to find myself in ten years time regretting not having > ridden for longer.\\" During the 2013–2014 season, Aspell had his best ever season, riding 61 winners so far. He was given the ride on Richard Newland's Pineau de Re in the 2014 Grand National after the horse's regular rider Sam Twiston-Davies opted to ride the more fancied Tidal Bay around three weeks prior to the race. After a false start, Aspell and Pineau de Re won the race by five lengths at odds of 25/1, winning £561,300 out of a £1,000,000 prize fund. At the 2015 Grand National, Aspell rode Many Clouds, against a field of 38 including his previous winner Pineau de Re. Pre-race, favourite A. P. McCoy had odds of 7-1 riding Shutthefrontdoor, Aspell had odds of 25-1. Aspell's victory makes him the first back-to-back Grand National winner in over 40 years since Red Rum with rider Brian Fletcher, and only the third since World War II, along with Bryan Marshall. Aspell stated after the race that \\"that's the best ride I have had in the National\\", his riding won £561,300 from the £1 million pot.

Built about 1782, it is one of the oldest houses in the eastern part of Harrisville, and was home for fifty years to the itinerant folk stenciler Moses Eaton Jr. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Moses Eaton Jr. House stands in a rural area in eastern Harrisville, at the northeast corner of Hancock Road and Sargent Camp Road. It is a 1-1/2 story plank-frame Cape style structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade faces south, and is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged around a central entry. The front roof face is pierced by a pair of two-window shed-roof dormers. A single-story ell extends to the rear, joining the house to an 18th-century barn. The interior retains some early period features, including stencilwork by its best-known resident. The house was built about 1782 by Daniel Warren, a veteran of the Battle of Bunker Hill. It is one of the best-preserved plank-style Capes in Harrisville, and the oldest building in the Eastview area of the town. It is also notable as the home for many years of the itinerant folk stenciler Moses Eaton Jr. Eaton and his father both practiced this trade, and instances of their work survive in houses scattered throughout New England. The shed-roof dormers were added to the house around 1916.

Background Pineau de Re is a bay gelding with no white markings bred in France by Michel Hardy. His sire Marresco Sorrento was a winning hurdler in France and has had some success as a sire of jumpers. His dam, Elfe du Perche was not a Thoroughbred, being of Selle Français ancestry. In July 2005 the gelding was consigned by the Ecurie Bayard to the Goffs France sale where he was bought for €20,000 by Seamus Murphy. The gelding was sent into training with Philip Fenton at Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary. Racing career =Irish career= Pineau de Re began his racing career in National Hunt Flat races in the 2007/2008 National Hunt season. He ran five times, finishing second on his debut at Limerick and recording his only success when winning at Fairyhouse on 23 February 2008. After missing the whole of the next two seasons, Pineau de Re returned as a Novice hurdler. He won on his debut over obstacles at Limerick on 17 November 2010. He was beaten in four subsequent starts but showed good form when finishing second in both the Grade I Royal Bond Novice Hurdle and the Grade II Michael Purcell Memorial Novice Hurdle. The gelding continued to compete over hurdles in the 2011/2012 season recording his only success in six attempts when winning a handicap race at Thurles Racecourse in October. In the following season, Pineau de Re was moved up to compete in steeplechases. He made little initial impact, being well beaten in his first four attempts over the larger obstacles before winning a minor event at Thurles on 3 January 2013. After two further defeats he was matched against more experienced opponent in the three and a half-mile Ulster Grand National at Downpatrick Racecourse on 3 April. Ridden by Danny Mullins, he started the 13/2 second favourite in a field of fifteen runners and won by twenty-three lengths. =British career= After his win in the Ulster National Pineau de Re was sold to John Provan and sent to be trained in England by Richard Newland at Claines in Worcestershire. Racing for his new connections, Pineau de Re ran four times without success in the summer of 2013. Pineau de Re began the 2013/2014 season by finishing fifth in a hurdle race at Cheltenham Racecourse and then fell in the Becher Chase on his first run at Aintree in December. Later that month he returned to handicap hurdling, finishing second at Carlisle Racecourse and seventh at Haydock Park. He recorded his first victory in England in a Veterans' Steeplechase (restricted to horses aged 10 or over) at Exeter Racecourse on 14 January. Ridden by Sam Twiston-Davies he started the 11/4 favourite and won by five lengths from Tullamore Dew. On his final appearance before the Grand National, Pineau de Re ran for the first time at the Cheltenham Festival when he contested the Pertemps Final, a two- mile, five furlong handicap hurdle. Starting a 33/1 outsider, he finished strongly to take third place, beaten a nose and a neck by Fingal Bay and Southfield Theatre. On 5 April, Pineau de Re started at odds of 25/1 for the 2014 Grand National at Aintree. He was ridden by the veteran jockey Leighton Aspell as Sam Twiston-Davies had opted to ride the more fancied Tidal Bay. The race was delayed by two false starts. Pineau de Re took the lead approaching the last of the thirty fences and drew away on the run-in to win by five lengths from Balthazar King, with the joint-favourite Double Seven in third place. After the race Aspell said \\"It's a wonderful day, this is what we do it for. I've been watching the National since I was a very young boy. As much as you enjoy sharing everyone's success, you crave a bit too. To get a chance to ride in the National is a great thing, and to get on one with a chance is even better\\". In the following season, Pineau de Re was again aimed at the National, but his form was poor. He finished towards the rear in hurdle races at Cheltenham in November and Exeter in February and was pulled up at Carlisle in December. He again ran in the Pertemps Final in March, but on this occasion he finished eleventh of the twenty-three runners behind Call The Cops. In the Grand National he started at odds of 25/1 and finished twelfth of the nineteen finishers behind Many Clouds. Pineau de Re returned in October 2015 and finished unplaced in a veteran's chase at Chepstow and then ran second to Vino Grigio at Sandown in November. The gelding fell at the second in the Becher Chase and then started at odds of 7/1 in a handicap hurdle at Carlisle on 13 December. Ridden by Richard Johnson he took the led at the second last and won by four lengths under a weight of 162 pounds. His victory was notable as no Grand National winner had gone on to win another race since Bindaree won the Welsh National in 2003. He was pulled up in a hurdle at Chepstow in February and then finished seventh in a veterans' chase at Newbury. He was assigned a weight of 142 pounds for the 2016 Grand National but did not qualify to run: the race was restricted to forty runners and Pineau de Re was rated forty- sixth in the handicap. Newland was unhappy at the exclusion, stating \\"The Grand National is the public's race and the public surely want to see a previous winner\\" before pointing out that many of the horses rated above Pineau de Re had earned their handicap marks over much shorter distances. Pineau is now a successful ROR horse and has been retrained as an eventer. He is on loan to and ridden by Lizzie Doolittle, who rides out at the Newlands as well as running her own event yard near Worcester with head girl Jojo Glanvill. Pineau has successfully completed several events at BE90 and BE100 level with aims to go Novice this year. Honours In July 2014 the sign welcoming visitors to the village of Claines was redesigned to read \\"Welcome to Claines, Home of 2014 Grand National winner Pineau De Re\\".

The most complex individual project was the reconstruction of the house to the Golden Libra (January 2018)The New Frankfurt Old Town (also known as the Dom-Römer Quarter or Quarter) is the centre of the old town of Frankfurt am Main, which was reconstructed from 2012 to 2018 as part of a major urban development project called the Dom-Römer Project (). The project redesigned and developed a 7,000 square meter property between Römerberg in the west and Domplatz in the east, delimited by Braubachstrasse in the north and the Schirn Kunsthalle in the south, in an effort to remake the old city centre, the Altstadt (old town) of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, which was severely damaged during World War II, in the style of the pre-war architecture. It aims to give the old town quarter between the Römerberg square and the Cathedral (Dom) new life. The old city had already been thoroughly changed in 1904 by hewing several aisles for wide streets into the medieval cluster of insalubrious houses and small alley ways, clearing the way for a tramway line through the historic centre. Due to the heavy bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II with many timber-framed buildings, most of the city's old town was destroyed. The efforts to rebuild parts of it began in the 1950s with the Römer city hall, which was built as a modern office building behind the old façade still standing after the war, and parts of the surrounding Römerberg square, building an underground multi-storey car park, and on top of that the modern Technisches RathausPhotos of the former Technisches Rathaus Frankfurt (Technical City Hall, built 1972–74), whose façade paid homage to the historic context of the city with the timber frame design (Fachwerk) of the pre-war architecture, but within the context of \\"Brutalist architecture\\". The Historisches Museum (Museum of city history) was also built, including a cinema. In its entrance way, the museum displayed a model of the old centre as it looked at the end of World War II; in ruins. The anti-brutalist movement continued in a public campaign to demolish the and to make the old city look like before the war. This did finally succeed, the and the Museum of City History were demolished in 2010/2011, and the reconstruction of the old town core began. The project is being built on top of a 1970s underground multi-storey car park and the U-Bahn Line B station underneath. Because of the demolition of the Technisches Rathaus, the underground moved and the tunnel had to be monitored closely and corrected several times. Civic engagement in particular led to the old-town-oriented planning of the Dom-Römer project. The 35 designs of new buildings were 2010/11 in several architectural competitions determined with more than 170 participants. The foundation stone was laid at the end of January 2012. At the end of 2017, all of the houses were largely completed from the outside. On May 9, 2018, the fences were removed and the new district was made fully accessible to the public.The construction fences fall: opening of the new Frankfurt old town from par.frankfurt.de, the former website of the city of Frankfurt am Main From September 28 to 30, 2018, a three-day old town festival was held for the opening.Altstadtfest Frankfurt, official website, accessed October 1, 2018.

März 2019.  History  Centre of the Dom-Römer area: the Chicken Market, 1903 Old town from 1862 with supplements until 1944 and overlay representation of the technical town hall (chromolithography by Friedrich August Ravenstein ). The yellow and green marked buildings were demolished as early as the 19th century, the violet marked for the tram lines through the newly created Braubachstrasse as part of the breakthrough of the old town in 1904 . The areas marked in dark red were torn down in 1927. The destroyed old town in June 1945 During the Second World War, the medieval old town of Frankfurt am Main, until then one of the best preserved in Central Europe, was almost completely destroyed by bombing. Only a few historical buildings remained, and in the post-war period, other damaged buildings were also demolished, mostly in favour of \\"car-friendly\\" traffic planning. There were very few external reconstructions of buildings and the majority of the former old town was rebuilt in the style of the 1950s, largely leaving the historic street network behind. Only the area between Römerberg and the cathedral remained after the rubble clearance wasteland, over whose development has long been debated. In the meantime, from 1953, archaeologists were able to uncover the remains of a Roman settlement, but also recent traces, especially from the Carolingian period, beneath the area of the high medieval layers. A centuries-long search for the origin of the city was therefore over, although the Royal Palatinate Frankfurt, which had previously only been handed down through documents, was not built by the legendary founder of Frankfurt, Charlemagne, but, according to findings, only by his son, Ludwig the Pious. In 1966 construction began on the B section of the Frankfurt subway between the main train station and the Konstablerwache. The line of the new underground also led through the old town, with a station under the previously undeveloped area used as a parking lot between the cathedral and the Roman. When the Dom/Römer underground station was built in 1970/71, due to the open construction method, it was accepted to destroy a large part of the oldest settlement floor in Frankfurt, which had not yet been archaeologically examined. Subsequently, after years of discussion on the site, the Technical City Hall was created in 1972–1974 as the seat of the technical offices of the city administration. Five old town houses on Braubachstrasse that had survived the war were demolished to excavate the construction pit. The building, built in the brutalist architectural style, represented with its enormous dimensions, dominated the former old town, not taking into account of the small-scale buildings in the area. The construction costs totalled DM 93 million. In addition to the underground, a two-storey underground car park was built under the Dom-Römer area, which extends east-west from Domstrasse to the Römer facade and north- south from Braubachstrasse to Saalgasse moves there. After the construction work was completed, the ceiling of the underground car park formed the new level, which was now about two meters above the historical floor level. The archaeological finds of the old town excavation from 1953, dating from the early days of Frankfurt, also initially removed, were preserved and made accessible to the public as an archaeological garden. In 1994 the city of Frankfurt sold the Technical City Hall for DM 148 million to Deutsche Immobilien Leasing (DIL), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. At the same time, the building was leased back to the city with the option that the city could buy back the town hall for DM 135 million after the lease expired in 2006, a so- called sale-lease-back agreement.  Planning History  = 2004–2006 = Technical City Hall, 2007 In 2004, the project developers Max Baum Immobilien and Groß & Partner, on behalf of the owner DIL, presented plans for a renovation of the 30-year-old technical town hall. According to plans by the Frankfurt office of Stefan Forster Architects, the building complex was to be divided into two houses by an alley from Braubachstrasse to the roundel of the Schirn Kunsthallebe to be created. For the concrete facades, a completely new design with a perforated facade made of natural stone was planned, for future use in the four-story base the city library as well as shops and restaurants. In addition, around 160 apartments were to be created in the three towers. The leasing contract with the city could have been extended to 20 years, subject to the modified use of the building. The facades of the technical town hall, July 2008 House of the Golden Libra, around 1900 The city council then decided in December 2004 to carry out an urban planning ideas competition in which both variants (renovation or demolition with subsequent small-scale development) were to be run through. In this context, voices could also be heard, \\"based on the small-scale Gothic structure of the old town, there [also] to achieve a small-scale structure.\\" If this was already an unusual procedure, it was made more difficult that no specifications were made for the future use of the area. The Chamber of Architects in Wiesbaden opposed this approachwho considered the obligation to submit two drafts impractical and called for a clear decision by politicians. The competition, originally announced for January 2005, ultimately did not take place.Matthias Alexander: Stadtplanung – Beim Technischen Rathaus auf dem Weg zur großen Lösung. In: faz.net, 4. September 2005. In May 2005, the Alliance of Four in the Romans, consisting of the CDU , SPD , FDP and the Greens, decided not to pursue the conversion variant any further. The following requirements were then set for the urban planning competition: small-scale buildings with facades and roofs that fit harmoniously into the old town, housing 20,000 m² of gross floor space within the property boundaries of the Technical City Hall, overbuilding of the archaeological garden with 7,000 m², continued use of the archaeological site Garden with the remains of the Royal Palatinate and the restoration of the old \\"coronation path\\" between the cathedral and the Roman. The name \\"Coronation Trail\\", an alternative name for the alley market(also known as the Old Market ), which existed until 1945, arose from the fact that a total of 16 coronation ceremonies for Roman-German kings were held in Frankfurt from the 14th to the 18th century. 20 offices took part in the urban planning competition.Abriß des Technischen Rathauses gesichert. In: faz.net, 25. Juli 2005. In July 2005, the city and DIL agreed on new contract modalities after the demolition of the technical town hall. These provided that the city would not buy back the property, but that the leasing model would continue. In August 2005, the Free Voters in the Römer submitted an application for the planned Dom-Römer area to approach the historic streets and squares and to reconstruct some important buildings in terms of urban planning, such as the Haus zur Goldenen Waage or the Haus zum Esslinger ( also known as Young Esslinger or Aunt Melber's house ). However, the winning design chosen by the Frankfurt office KSP Engel and Zimmermann in September 2005 met only a few of these requirements. The \\"Coronation Trail\\" was not laid out along the course of the market, which was even largely respected by the construction of the Technical Town Hall in 1972, but in a straight diagonal fromStone house to the cathedral tower. The overplanned areas of the technical town hall and the archaeological garden were once again occupied by large buildings; a residential complex with three courtyards was to be built on Braubachstrasse. In addition to a narrow building, a trapezoidal square was planned at the level of the archaeological garden, which, like the diagonal to the cathedral tower, had never existed in a similar form in Frankfurt's urban history. New Red House on the market , around 1910 At the presentation of the draft, however, Edwin Schwarz (CDU), head of the planning department, emphasised that it was only a suggestion of how the required building dimensions should be distributed: \\"What can be seen here will not be built this way\\". Other architectural competitions would decide on the final design. Schwarz also spoke out against the reconstruction of individual historical buildings, since these would then stand next to modern buildings.Günter Murr: Der lange Weg zur neuen Frankfurter Altstadt., In: fnp.de, 8. Mai 2018.

In: faz.net, 16. September 2005. The winning design was discussed controversially, in particular the laying of the \\"Coronation Trail\\", the buildings felt to be too massive and their flat roofs, which do not harmonise with the gable roofs of the old town, were criticized. The city council also voiced voices to revise the draft significantly and to lean more closely on the historical model.Stadtplanung: Dezernat will Architektenwettbewerbe für Frankfurts neue Mitte In: faz.net, 20. September 2005. In September 2005, the Frankfurt SPD proposed to leave the decision on the design of the Dom-Römer-area citizens and a referendum to organize. According to the SPD, two or three competing designs with historical or historicizing and modern buildings should be developed.SPD will Bürger zu künftiger Altstadt-Bebauung befragen.

It became clear that the factions in the Romans were largely able to agree on a common line: the most exact possible restoration of the historical floor plan with its alleys, squares and courtyards, as well as the reconstruction of individual, significant houses.Matthias Alexander: Sonderausschuß zur Altstadt. Viele Wünsche und manche Bedenken. In: faz.net, 8. Dezember 2005. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mayor Petra Roth (CDU) suggested that four buildings, including the Haus zur Goldenen Waage and the Neue Rote Haus, be reconstructed, but Roth believed that these could not be found in their original locations rebuild. It should therefore be considered whether these buildings should be arranged side by side or in other places.„Ich will Frankfurt sein Herz zurückgeben“. In: faz.net, 31. Dezember 2005. In May 2006, hired by the German Federal Government architect (BDA) Workshop organized architectural models based on the KSP winning design. A total of 50 architects drafted proposals for 20 plots to be built, with the spectrum of designs ranging from modern buildings with a high proportion of glass to modern interpretations of half-timbered houses (similar to the houses built in Saalgasse in the 1980s).Matthias Alexander: Ansichten zur Altstadt. In: faz.net, 7. Mai 2006. In June 2006 it was announced that the demolition of the technical town hall could not begin until 2008 at the earliest, as the relocation of the offices located there would be delayed due to renovations in the new branch. At the beginning of September 2006, the black-green coalition in the Römer, contrary to previous announcements, decided to buy back the Technical Town Hall on April 1, 2007 and thus terminate the leasing contract with DIL. A working group was also set up to present a usage concept for the site.Matthias Alexander: Altstadt. Arbeitsgruppe für das Altstadt-Areal. In: faz.net, 7. September 2006. In order to involve the citizens in the planning, a planning workshop with around 60 participants was carried out by the city in autumn 2006. The first weekend event in October was attended by one third of citizens who came from initiatives and associations proposed by the factions of the city council and which were selected by lot. After the introduction with lectures and tours, groups worked on the topics of the use of the building plots and their subdivision, overbuilding of the archaeological garden, reconstruction of old town houses and design guidelines for the buildings. In the second event in December, the same participants discussed the revised urban planning concept. The recommendations of the groups were incorporated into the following key points.stadtplanungsamt-frankfurt.de In November 2006, the black-green coalition presented key points for the future development of the old town: extensive restoration of the historical city plan, reconstruction of four buildings (Haus zur Goldenen Waage, Neues Rotes Haus, Haus zum Esslinger and Goldenes Lämmchen) at the historical location by the city itself, as well as design guidelines for the other houses. The aim was to use a high proportion of housing; the archaeological garden was to be built over in small parts and remain open to the public.Bedeutsame Altstadt- Häuser werden „qualitätvoll“ rekonstruiert.

In May 2007 it became known that the coalition had increased the number of buildings to be reconstructed to six to seven: In addition, the houses in Klein-Nürnberg and Alter Esslinger were to be rebuilt, and with them the entire row of houses north of Gasse Hinter dem Lämmchen. In addition, the possibility of initially reconstructing the Rebstock house was determined.Sieben Altstadthäuser sollen rekonstruiert werden. In: faz.net, 7.

In September 2007, the city council approved a corresponding municipal bill, which also provides for the reconstruction of additional buildings, provided that private investors can be found for them. Five years were scheduled for the construction, although the demolition of the technical town hall could not begin before mid-2009. A separate architectural competition was sought for the development of the archaeological garden. The development should be carried out from a single source, because the underground car park underneath the site and the Dom/Römer underground station require complicated construction site logistics.Eine Totalrekonstruktion ist noch denkbar. In: faz.net, 7. September 2007. In November 2008, it became known that the contract for the construction of the Dom-Römer area was to be put out to tender across Europe after the city initially favored a direct award to Frankfurter Aufbau AG and OFB Projektentwicklung. The planned invitation to tender was stopped, however, when it became known that technical problems were to be expected when the Technical Town Hall was demolished: Only if it was demolished down to the ground floor would it be ensured that the underground tunnel under the building would not be flooded by groundwater If there is a total demolition, there is a danger if the new building is not started at the same time. Central problems such as relocating the entrances to the subway in the new building are still unsolved.Claus-Jürgen Göpfert: Gefahr des Aufschwimmens. In: Frankfurter Rundschau, 29. November 2008. In March 2009, the city of Frankfurt announced that it would refrain from a Europe-wide tender and instead look after an urban project company with the new building project. According to the city, the legal requirements, which stipulate a Europe-wide tender, are not applicable to the award route chosen now, since the project company that is still to be founded will be fully owned by the city. The move of the city offices from the Technical City Hall is now planned for autumn 2009, and the demolition should begin in 2010. In July 2009, an architecture competition for the development of the archaeological garden, called \\"Stadthaus am Markt\\", was launched. In addition, the Dom-Römer GmbH was founded as an urban company for the development of the Dom-Römer area.Matthias Alexander: Stadt Frankfurt gründet Baugesellschaft für Altstadt. In: faz.net, 10. Juli 2009. According to an initial estimate by Dom-Römer GmbH, the cost of building the old town was € 95 million, of which € 20 million was due to the demolition of the town hall.Matthias Alexander: Altstadtprojekt kostet gut 100 Millionen Euro. In: faz.net, 10. Oktober 2009. In December 2009, the design by the architecture firm Prof. Bernd Winking Architects for the “Stadthaus am Markt” was awarded 1st prize. This provided for a compact building above the archaeological garden, but the draft was to be revised in consultation with the planning office of the city of Frankfurt.Matthias Alexander: Stadthaus auf Fundament der Königshalle. In: faz.net, 19. Dezember 2009. The four winners of the competition for the “Stadthaus am Markt” were asked by the city to revise their designs. This made it clear that the design that won the first prize will not necessarily be implemented.Matthias Alexander: Stadthaus-Entwürfe werden überarbeitet. In: faz.net, 26. August 2010. In March 2010, the city announced that the review of a reconstruction of the Rebstock house had given a positive result that it would also reconstruct the neighboring building at Braubachstrasse 21. This brought the number of reconstructions financed by the city to eight, namely Markt 5 (Haus zur Goldenen Waage), Markt 17 (Neues Rotes Haus), Hinter dem Lämmchen 2 (Haus zum Esslinger), Hinter dem Lämmchen 4 (Alter Esslinger), Behind the Lämmchen 6 (Goldenes Lämmchen), Behind the Lämmchen 8 (Klein-Nürnberg), Braubachstrasse 19 (Rebstock house) and Braubachstrasse 21.Dom-Römer-Projekt: Übersichtskarte des Quartiers For 15 other buildings, Dom-Römer GmbH initially considered a reconstruction based on the available documentation to be feasible, provided that private investors were found.Rainer Schulze: Weitere Rekonstruktionen an Hühnermarkt und Krönungsweg. In: faz.net, 11. Juni 2010., the number of additional reconstructions was later reduced to nine, namely Hühnermarkt 18 (Schildknecht house), Hühnermarkt 20 (Zur Flechte), Hühnermarkt 22 (golden scissors), Hühnermarkt 24 (Eichhorn), Hühnermarkt 26 (Schlegel), Markt 13 (green lime tree), Markt 15 (old red house), Markt 28 (Würzgarten) and Braubachstrasse 27. The deadline for interested parties to purchase a property in the Dom-Römer area ended on July 31, 2010.In Frankfurts Altstadt werden höchstens 17 Häuser rekonstruiert. In: faz.net, 15. März 2011. = 2010–2012 = On June 12, 2010, the statutes for the Dom-Römer area came into force. This described guidelines for the structure and design of facades and roofs as well as the use of materials. Basically, only steeply pitched gable roofs with a minimum of 55 degrees were permitted. In August 2010 an open architecture competition for the new buildings on the Dom-Römer area was announced. A total of 56 architectural firms were selected to participate and were to develop new building designs for a total of 27 plots. Together with the eight plots that were planned for urban reconstructions, a total of 35 buildings were to be built on the site. In September 2010, after a round of revisions, the fourth- placed architectural firm Meurer Architects was selected with a revised design for the “Stadthaus am Markt”. The design envisaged building almost the entire archaeological garden and moved the building close to the cathedral. In order to maintain a small appearance, the building dimensions were designed as an ensemble of five buildings.Matthias Alexander: Meurer Architekten setzen sich durch. In: faz.net, 24. September 2010. In March 2011, the results of the architecture competition for the new buildings on the Dom-Römer area were presented. A total of 24 first and 12 second prizes were awarded, plus 13 recognition's. Parcels where more than one prize was awarded were reassessed. No prices were awarded for two plots, Markt 7 and Markt 40.Dom-Römer-Projekt: Masterplanung (PDF) abgerufen am 7. November 2018. In April 2011, the designs were publicly exhibited in the Paulskirche in Frankfurt, while the planning services for the eight urban and nine optional reconstructions were put out to tender. In July 2011, Dom-Römer GmbH announced another competition for the two plots Markt 7 and Markt 40, which resulted in first and three second prizes in October 2011, plus two recognition's. On January 24, 2012, Dom-Römer GmbH presented the results of which architects were selected for the development of the Dom-Römer area and thus for the first time an overview of the future shape of the old town. In addition to the eight urban reconstructions, buyers were found for seven of the nine optional reconstructions. Only the builders of the Hühnermarkt 18 plots (Schildknecht house) and Braubachstraße 27 opted for new buildings. In total, 15 reconstructions and 20 new buildings were to be built. The chicken market as the central square of the new old town was reconstructed on three sides. The architects, who were awarded first prizes in 2011, prevailed over the new buildings, which fit harmoniously into the ensemble of the old town, but should nevertheless be recognizable as 21st century buildings. A citizens' initiative formed against the competition results in 2013 and unsuccessfully attempted to implement more reconstructions with the help of a citizens' decision.Initiative „Altstadt retten“ Frankfurt In February 2012, the budget coalition of the black and green city government submitted a list of savings proposals, which included a preliminary waiver of the construction of the “town house on the market”. The proposal triggered mixed reactions: the citizens' initiative SOS Dompanorama, which is committed to maintaining a clear view from the Römerberg to the cathedral, welcomed the decision, while others, such as Michael Guntersdorf, managing director of Dom- Römer GmbH, thereby welcomed the old town project as a whole saw in danger.Matthias Alexander: Altstadt-Projekt insgesamt in Gefahr. In: faz.net, 9. Februar 2012. Because of the necessary expenditure for indispensable technical buildings and outdoor facilities, a waiver of the town house would have resulted in a budget saving of only a maximum of 8 million euros.  Architectural History  Dom-Römer area with the remains of the technical town hall (August 2011) At the beginning of April 2010, the demolition of the technical town hall officially started with the first excavator bite.Felix Helbig: Ende eines Frankfurter Stadtkapitels. In: Frankfurter Rundschau, 12. April. 2010. By November 2010, the building was initially removed only to the ground floor, then prepared the two-storey underground car park for demolition, the entire building services has been removed. From May 2011 to early 2012, the rest of the building was demolished. The foundation stone for the development of the Dom-Römer area was laid symbolically on January 23, 2012.. With the laying of the foundation stone, work began on the floor slab for the future old town development.Dom-Römer-Projekt: Das DomRömer-Projekt macht sichtbare Fortschritte The buildings are on the ceiling of the 1970 to 1972 built, two-storey underground subway station and parking garage Dom- Romans.Dom-Römer-Projekt: Parkhaus DomRömer: … der nördliche Teil der Tiefgarage wird nach seiner Neuerstellung auch die Keller und Funktionsräume der neuen Altstadthäuser aufnehmen. Das Parkhaus ist damit Fundament der Neubebauung im Norden. For logistical reasons, the Dom-Römer area was built from south to north; the southernmost building was the town house on the market. In May 2012, the Monument Office examined whether there are other important ground monuments in the eastern area of the archaeological garden. Further parts of the Carolingian royal palatinate were discovered, which were included in the planning for the town house. In August 2012, the so-called Schirn table, an extension to the Schirn art gallery, was demolished in order to create more space for the new old town.Letzte Blicke auf den Schirn-Tisch. In: Frankfurter Neue Presse, 7. August 2012. During the foundation work for the town house and the southern row of houses on the market of the archaeological garden was geotextile packed, filled with a gravel-like material and covered with a layer of concrete. The foundation work on the town house was completed in spring 2013 and the archaeological garden was uncovered again. The shell of the town house began in May 2013. The completion of the town house, which was originally planned for 2014, was delayed until the end of 2015; the completion of the entire Dom-Römer area was planned for 2017.Grundstein für neue Altstadt gelegt. In: faz.net, 23. Januar 2012. In December 2015, it was announced that the construction costs of the project would not be around 170 million euros, but would again amount to 185.7 million euros, according to a new estimate. The townhouse was finally opened in June 2016.Rainer Schulze: Stadthaus Frankfurt: Ein neuer Rahmen für den Domturm. In: faz.net, 13. Juni 2016.

A virtual project film gave an impression of what the old town will look like after completion.Dom-Römer-Projekt: Willkommen in der neuen Mitte Frankfurts. On December 12, 2016, the managing director of the GmbH reported to the Dom-Römer special committee that the current calculation was 196 million euros. As the head of planning stated, the additional costs would arise from non-project costs, such as the renovation of the underground car park. At the same time bring only the 65 apartments on the site of a 90 million euro for the city.Claus-Jürgen Göpfert: Rekonstruktion: Frankfurter Altstadt ab Februar offen. In: Frankfurter Rundschau, 20.

From September 28 to 30, 2018, the new old town district was officially opened with an old town festival, in which more than 250,000 visitors took part. Frankfurt Am Main-Fay-BADAFAMNDN-Heft 14-Nr 163-1904-Der Huehnermarkt-UCSAR-A.jpgBuilding facade Hühnermarkt, before destruction 1944 Dom-Römer-Projekt-Hühnermarkt-803.jpgReconstructed and newly interpreted at the same site 2018 The actual total cost of the project will be available in spring 2020 when all buildings are occupied and identified deficiencies are resolved. According to the current economic plan, DomRömer GmbH anticipates total costs of “around 200, maximum 210 million euros”. The city of Frankfurt raised around 75 million euros from the sale of the apartments. Over € 80 million was also transferred to the city's fixed assets, including the Stadthaus am Markt (€ 25 million), the refurbished underground car park (€ 35 million), the Goldene Waage and Neues Rotes Haus (€ 8 million and € 3 million respectively). The value of the shops and restaurants from which the city generates ongoing rental income is around 12 million euros. About 15 to 20 percent of the additional costs incurred during the construction period are due to changes in the plan and interventions in the construction process.  Streets  In terms of approval, the Dom-Römer project comprised a single construction project - \\"Reconstruction of the underground car park and the construction of a new building with residential and business use, museum, bar and restaurant business, accommodation, sales and meeting facilities\\" - on parcel 199/41. following buildings and ensembles, connected by streets: = Braubachstraße - South Side = Inner courtyard Braubachstrasse 29 Five houses and a rear building with access from Neugasse were built on Braubachstrasse, one of them as a reconstruction. The house at Braubachstrasse 21, formerly Im Rebstock 3 is a three-storey residential and farm building, which originally came from the 16th century and was externally changed in the Baroque period. In the typical Frankfurt style of construction, two cantilevered half-timbered floors rise above a stone ground floor. The house shows the reconstructed quarry stone firewall on Braubachstrasse, which was uncovered when the street was demolished in 1905. The eaves side to the Hof Rebstock on the market is with a house with a baroque wave gable and several dormer windows. The reconstruction is a design by the Frankfurt office Jourdan & Müller. The ground floor is used by the administration of the Katharinen- and Weißfrauenstift, a non-profit foundation of the Frankfurt patrician and cleric Wicker Frosch dating back to 1353. On the north-east corner of the house, as has been the case since 1935, the preserved spolia of the winegrower monument is embedded. To the west of this is the new building at Braubachstrasse 23, designed by Einartner Khorrami Architects, Leipzig. The four-storey house with a mansard roof is completely clad with red Frankfurt region sandstone. A small statue known as the cider drinker is mounted on the northwest corner of the building on Neugasse, a relic from the previous building built by Hermann Senf in 1940. The Golden Cross house (Braubachstraße 25b) by Bernd Albers, Berlin, is a rear building to Braubachstraße 23 and connected to it by three archways based on the historical model. Like its predecessor from the 18th century, the three-story house has a gnome on the northern eaves. The two gable sides face the Neugasse and the courtyard to the vine.Dietrich-Wilhelm Dreysse, Volkmar Hepp, Björn Wissenbach, Peter Bierling: Planung Bereich Dom – Römer. Dokumentation Altstadt. Stadtplanungsamt der Stadt Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt am Main 2006, Haus 7 (S. 41)(online; PDF; 14,8 MB) The neighboring house on the western side of Neugasse is also made of red sandstone. The three-storey building Braubachstrasse 27 with a two-storey classicist gable was designed by Eckert Neebger Suselbeek, Berlin. The house Braubachstrasse 29 by Bernd Albers has two facades: The front of Braubachstrasse consists of a ground floor with five arcades, three horizontally structured upper floors, the top one of which is set off by a cornice. The recessed top floor is divided by a five-axis dwelling house, next to it two attics each. The main portal is additionally emphasized by a semi- reliefexecuted figure of Mary. It leads into the courtyard of the Golden Lamb. The rear facade of the Lämmchenhof is an exact reconstruction of the previous building from 1911, which in turn was a reconstruction of the state from 1693. The house at the Glauburger Hof (Braubachstrasse 31) was based on the Art Nouveau building from 1913, which was demolished in 1970 for the Technical City Hall. The design comes from Knerer and Lang Architects, Dresden. The lettering The new tumbles down and old life blooms from the ruins, the parody of a sentence from Schiller's Wilhelm Tell, was inserted into its facade. = Market \\"coronation\\" Street - North Side = Würzgarten House (Markt 28) The north side of the market street comprises of four new buildings between the cathedral and the chicken market. The first, separated from the Haus am Dom by a narrow passage to the Rebstock courtyard on the market, is the Großer Rebstock (Markt 8), first mentioned in 1342, a design by Jordi Keller Architects, Berlin. The five-story house is directly opposite the golden scales. The two arcades on the ground floor form the eastern entrance to the Dom / Römer underground station. Reinforced concrete foils from the Technical Town Hall are inserted into the facade. Like the new building, its classicist predecessor, built around 1800, was a stone building. The narrow house to the westSchönau (Markt 10) is a design by Ey's Berlin office. With its sandstone base and the four projecting, slated upper floors, it is reminiscent of the Gothic predecessor Schildknecht / pharmacy. The originally three-storey half- timbered house, first mentioned in 1472, was extended in the 17th century with a wave gable. The Vorderer Schildknecht house (Markt 12) comes from Dreibund architects from Bochum and is very similar to the Goldenes Haupt house (Markt 36) designed by the same office. A particularly striking slate facade in old German covering carries the corner house to the chicken market, New Paradise (Market 14) by Johannes Götz and Guido Lohmann from Cologne. The predecessor was a five-storey classicist building with a flat pent roof built around 1800. It was considered to be of little importance and was accordingly poorly documented. House to the three Romans (Markt 40) To the west of the chicken market there are two reconstructions followed by six new buildings. The southwestern corner house on Hühnermarkt is called Schlegel (Markt 26). The replica of a predecessor built around 1830 in the strict formal language of the classicist building code issued by city architect Johann Georg Christian Hess in 1809 comes from Hans Kollhoff, Berlin and Jourdan & Müller, Frankfurt am Main. Its entrance emphasizes the corner house function. The western neighbor Würzgarten (Markt 28) is a reconstruction of a house that was first mentioned in 1292. It is a plastered half-timbered house from the 16th century with a two-storey slated gable, which has a characteristic overhang directly below the ridge, known as a Frankfurt nose. The old department store (Markt 30) is a design by Morger and Dettli from Basel. The three-story building with a pointed gable is formally reduced to the outermost and is strictly limited to the basic elements specified by the design statutes. To the west are the new buildings Goldene Schachtel (Markt 32) by Tillmann Wagner Architects from Berlin and Alter Burggraf (Markt 34) by Francesco Collotti, Milan. Like the old department store, they are each connected to their rear buildings via a back yard, the facades of which lead to the narrow alley behind the lamb demonstrate. The Golden Head (Market 36) by Dreibund Architekten occupies one of the narrowest plots in the Dom-Römer district. The towering ground floor is reminiscent of the bob flooring of the previous building. There is a shop of the Höchst Porcelain Manufactory in the house. The House of Milan (Markt 38) by Michael A. Landes, Frankfurt, is unlike its baroque predecessor, gable- independent, but takes up the design elements in the form of the windows. The western end of the new development area is the House of the Three Romans (Markt 40) by Jordi Keller Architects with its three sides to the market, to Römerberg and to Gasse Hinter dem Lämmchen. Various statues and sculptures are installed on the ground floor and on the gable side. One of them is reminiscent of a member of the design advisory board for the reconstruction of the old town. Also show the sandstone arcades on the ground floor used clear traces of war damage. They come from the ground floor of the Zum Saal house, which was built in 1636 and demolished in 1950 at Saalgasse 29. The all-round three-sided banner bears the engraved and gilded inscriptions “Thorn and thistle sting very. False tongues much more. But I would rather bathe through thistle and thorn than be loaded with false tongues. And if envy made fires like fire, the wood would not be half as expensive and if the envious were so much, what God has will happen want\\". They come from the novel The Man from the Romans by the Frankfurt dialect poet Georg Wilhelm Pfeiffer. = Market \\"coronation\\" Street - South Side = View from the chicken market to the cathedral View from the Schirn to the chicken market Seven houses were built on the south side of the market, four of which were reconstructions. The House of the Golden Scales (market 5) of Jourdan & Müller was the most elaborate reconstruction of the Dom-Römer project. As before the destruction, it will in future be used as a branch of the Historical Museum, and a coffee house and the Stoltze Museum will also move in. The following three plots, Market 7 to Market 11, are of very shallow depth, as their backs meet the back of the Golden Libra. The house Weißer Bock (Markt 7) is a new building by Helmut Riemann, Lübeck. It is used for the barrier-free access to the Golden Libra, which does not have its own staircase, and is also used by the Stoltze Museum. The predecessor building, first mentioned in 1467, was a three-storey, gabled, half-timbered house with two attics, which had been rebuilt in the 18th and late 19th centuries. The three-storey new building has a simple sandstone facade with six windows per floor, as with the predecessor. The neighboring building Kleiner Vogelsang is a semi-detached house (Markt 9/11) by Dreibund Architekten. The previous buildings from the 16th century were four-storey half-timbered buildings, plastered to the gable. The two plots are extremely narrow and used to be one of the smallest plots in the old town. The baroque gable of the Markt 11 house transitions into the reconstructed green linden tree (Markt 13). The first time in 1439 mentioned building was rebuilt in the 18th century baroque. Before it was destroyed, it housed a well-known inn, and today there is a wine bar here. Two plastered half-timbered upper floors, each with six window axes, rise above a high sandstone ground floor with a bobble covering. The mansard roof has a broad dwelling with four windows and a triangular gable.Dietrich-Wilhelm Dreysse, Volkmar Hepp, Björn Wissenbach, Peter Bierling: Planung Bereich Dom – Römer. Dokumentation Altstadt. Stadtplanungsamt der Stadt Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt am Main 2006, Haus 39 (S. 74) (online; PDF; 14,8 MB) West of the green lime tree follow two other replicas of the Red House (Market 15) and the New Red House (Market 17). The New Red House, first mentioned in 1322, probably dates back to the 14th century, the neighbour from the 16th century. The two houses were previously connected to each other inside, the New Red House had no separate entrance. With its ground floor structure consisting essentially of only three oak columns, which bore the entire weight of the three-story building above it, the New Red House was unique in the entire German half-timbered landscape and a well-known attraction far beyond the city. It was considered an outstanding example of medieval town planning and community spirit in the lively centre of the old town. The Red House formed the passage to Tuchgaden and stood at the entrance to the butcher's quarter on the Lange Schirn, at which the Frankfurter sausages have been sold since ancient times. The new building is also used by a butcher, which also has a sales stand in the Kleinmarkthalle. There is a height difference of more than two meters between the street level of the reconstructed Old Market and today's Bendergasse along the Schirn. It is made clear in the section between the New Red House and the western entrance to the Dom / Römer underground station by a wall and pergola made of sandstone. Due to the protruding rotunda of the Schirn, there was not enough space in this section for a southern row of houses opposite the Markt 26 to Markt 40 houses. Before the destruction, there were three narrow alleys in this section; Goldhutgasse, Drachengasse and sword-alley which led to the Five Finger Square. = Rebstock-Hof = Hof zum Rebstock, left part of the back of Markt 2 The east side of the Rebstock-Hof is the Haus am Dom, which was built from 2001 to 2004 through the renovation and expansion of the main customs office built by Werner Hebebrand in 1927. The house at the cathedral was extended at the southern end during the renovation, so that it protrudes a few meters from the historic building of the old market and comes closer to the reconstructed House of the Golden Scales. The northern entrance to the Rebstock-Hof lies between two buildings. The north side of it is the new building Rebstock-Hof 2 (Markt 2, formerly Im Rebstock 2), a residential and commercial building by Meurer, Frankfurt. At the western edge of the courtyard, the reconstruction Hof zum Rebstock (Braubachstrasse 15, formerly Im Rebstock 1) was built by Jourdan & Müller). The building was built in the middle of the 18th century, using older components from the Gothic predecessor, first mentioned in 1392. Instead of the usual overhangs, the two half-timbered upper floors were given wooden arcades in front, also on the back to the inner courtyard on Neugasse. The gable roof is divided by a dwarf house with a Rhenish wave gable and two rows of dormer windows. The non-profit Frankfurt association runs a senior café on the ground floor of the courtyard facing the vine. The northern neighboring building Braubachstrasse 21 (formerly Im Rebstock 3) already belongs to Braubachstrasse. The famous Frankfurt writer and local poet Friedrich Stoltze was born on November 21, 1816 in the Rebstock ensemble. = Hühnermarkt = The resurrected Chicken Market. The Hühnermarkt (English: Chicken Market) is the centre of the new old town. All houses on the Chicken Market have the address Markt, except for the Haus zum Esslinger, which already belongs to the street Hinter dem Lämmchen. Eight of the eleven houses around the Chicken Market are reconstructions. Five of them are on the south side or at the corners of the market and are described in the course of the street there. These are the houses Green Lime Tree (Market 13), New Paradise (Market 14), Red House (Market 15), New Red House (Market 17) and Schlegel (Market 26). The corner house Markt 22 Goldene Schere, by Hans Kollhoff, Berlin, and Jourdan & Müller, Frankfurt is a baroque four-story building with an octagonal roof lantern. Markt 24 Eichhorn, also by Kollhof and Jourdan & Müller, like its southern neighbor Markt 26, is an example of the strict classicism of the building code of 1807 by city architect Johann Georg Christian Hess. The north side is formed by the reconstructed houses Zum Esslinger (Hinter dem Lämmchen 2) and Markt 20 Zur Flechte, between which the narrow Neugasse runs to Braubachstrasse. Both houses are of Gothic origin, with clear overhangs on the upper floors, which were later rebuilt in the Baroque style. They both have mansard roofs with a dwarf house with a triangular gable and an oculus window facing towards the Chicken Market. The Haus zum Esslinger is one of the Goethe sites in Frankfurt: it belonged to Goethe's aunt Johanna Melber and her husband, the dealer Georg Adolf Melber. The poet lived with his aunt here in 1755/56. The Struwwelpeter Museum will use the house from May 2019.Beate Zekorn-von Bebenburg: Struwwelpeter zieht um, www.struwwelpeter-museum.de, abgerufen am 29. September 2018. The three-storey Schildknecht / Spiegel (Markt 18), which was built around 1405 and was last built in the 17th century, formed the northeast corner building of the Hühnermarkt. With an almost two meter wide overhang, it had the largest overhang of all Frankfurt half-timbered houses. It had a richly painted facade and stylistically belonged to the Renaissance. The new building is in the style of the old house with elements such as the tapered wave gables. Kleine Seligeneck (Markt 16) by Van den Valentyn- Architektur, Cologne, is strongly stylistically based on its predecessor, a classicist building from around 1830. = Hinter dem Lämmchen = View down the street Hinter dem Lämmchen, towards the Chicken Market. The neighbouring houses Haus zum Esslinger, Alter Esslinger (Hinter dem Lämmchen 4) is the reconstruction of a powerful three-storey Renaissance half-timbered house built by Dreysse Architects, Frankfurt am Main, from the 17th century. Above a stone ground floor there are two cantilevered half-timbered upper floors to a remarkably tall height compared to the neighbouring buildings. The eaves saddle roof carries a two-storey slated roof with a wave gable. The \\"Old Esslinger\\" will also be used by the Struwwelpeter Museum from May 2019. The front building of the Golden Lämmchen (Behind the Lämmchen 6) was reconstructed by Macholz - Kummer Architects, Darmstadt for architect Claus Giel, Dieburg. The half-timbering on the two upper floors is plastered, as has been common in Frankfurt since the 18th century. The neighbouring house Klein Nürnberg (Behind the Lämmchen 8) stood on the corner of the Nürnberger Hofgäßchens, the southern entrance to the Nürnberger Hof. The three-storey Renaissance building from the 16th century was reconstructed by Dreysse Architects, Frankfurt am Main and Jourdan & Müller, Frankfurt am Main. The vaulted hall, whose six cross vaults rest on two central pillars, is a reminder of its former importance as a trade fair building. The new building is used by the Evangelical Regional Association Frankfurt am Main as the parish hall of the Paulsgemeinde and the Indonesian community. The only reconstruction on the south side of the alley is the house Goldene Schere (Markt 22, side entrance, formerly Hinter dem Lämmchen 1) by the architects Hans Kollhoff, Berlin and Jourdan & Müller, Frankfurt am Main. The four-story building in classicist forms was created in the 18th century by conversion from two older predecessor buildings. The overhangs of the two upper floors were still preserved on their facade to the alley behind the lamb. The neighbouring building to the west is the rear building of the old department store (Markt 30, formerly Hinter dem Lämmchen 3).  Reception  Public criticism and approval accompanied the project from the start. The lines of argumentation often followed the same pattern as since the beginning of the reconstruction debate immediately after the destruction. Dieter Bartetzko compares the old town with an unfathomably deep fountain that draws on the myths of the past and gives life in the present. He recalls that the fountain on the chicken market was drilled as early as Roman times and that the Carolingian people were probably already aware that they lived on historical ground. This explains why Frankfurt was referred to in its first documentary mention in 794 as a locus celeber, a celebrated site. He describes the old town with Nietzsche as an architectural palimpsest that always keeps the memory of the past in the minds of city dwellers, no matter how often it is overwritten. He explains this thesis using the example of the new building at Großer Rebstock (Markt 8) and the reconstruction at Braubachstraße 21. In contrast, the Technical City Hall, \\"rammed as a concrete juggernaut in the middle of the previously closed row of houses on Braubachstrasse\\", had remained a provocative and ignorant foreign body in the urban fabric for decades. In spite of its architectural quality, this was his doom.Dieter Bartetzko: Mut zum Traum, in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 11. April 2015. Dankwart Guratzsch points to the broad consensus in which the reconstruction was decided. \\"It is the will of a committed citizenry ... It is a piece of civic pride that manifests itself in these houses, and the best craftsmen, artists, monument experts and architects contribute to it ... The citizen of the almost digitally located society insures the lost anchor of its origin and provides it with rock solid reinforcement made of cement\\".Dankwart Guratzsch: Warum uns städtische Rekonstruktion gut tut – Frankfurt baut sein prächtiges historisches Zentrum neu auf. In: Die Welt, 8. April 2015. Jürgen Tietz doubts that the new old town will make a contribution to the future of the city. It is a fairytale world, the danger is great that “only a dollhouse will be created, a backdrop for photographing tourists, selfie stick drawn and thumbs up. What characterizes historic old towns cannot be ordered and also not simply built”. The creative replicas are “fake architecture”, “between the concrete structure and the exposed stone wall, the insulation wool peels out and proves that history is even possible in the face of today's building regulations cannot be reproduced true to the original”.Jürgen Tietz: Frankfurts rekonstruierte «Altstadt»: Märchenstunde am Main. In: Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 20. März 2017. Philipp Oswalt said similarly. It is absurd to build so few apartments for 200 million. The city stopped social housing, subsidized luxury apartments and thus privatized public goods.Philipp Oswalt: Geschichte, wie sie niemals war In: Merkur, Ausgabe September 2018. The entire Dom-Römer project is an expression of a conservative zeitgeist that hides the disintegration of public cohesion through symbolic-media replacement. \\"It's not a question of how you can build a city that is useful today - it's about generating an image of a city\\".Philipp Oswalt: Die neue Frankfurter Altstadt – „Fake-Ästhetik“ im öffentlichen Raum? In: deutschlandfunk, 6. Mai 2018. Stephan Trüby criticized the entire project. The New Old Town was initiated by Claus Wolfschlagback, a \\"right-wing radical with links to the extremist milieu\\". This is no coincidence, \\"the reconstruction architecture in Germany is currently developing into a key medium of authoritarian, ethnic, historical revisionist rights\\". It was \\"scandalous that the initiative of a right-wing radical without any significant civil society resistance led to a slick neighborhood with seemingly seamless repeat architectures\\". The new old town is \\"a sub-complex heal-world building that reduces history to a one- dimensional concert of your dreams ... A history in which National Socialism, the German wars of aggression and the Holocaust still survive as anecdotes of an otherwise unbroken national history\\".Stephan Trüby: Wir haben das Haus am rechten Fleck In: Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, 8. April 2018. Trüby's theses also received international attention, for example in the Observe.Rowan Moore: Is far-right ideology twisting the concept of ‚heritage‘ in German architecture? in The Guardian, 6. Oktober 2018, abgerufen am 4. Januar 2018. The architecture journalist Enrico Santifaller contradicts this. The debate about the old town has historical roots, since 1880 the design has always been struggling anew, with opponents and advocates of reconstructions not fitting in a right-left scheme. The reconstruction of the Römerberg- Ostzeile was based on an idea by the SPD Mayor Rudi Arndt. At the same time, Linke and Spontis had instigated the Frankfurt house fight, “sociologists see today as the beginning of a second homeland security movement”. Te \\"storm of indignation\\", which was triggered by the \\"remarkably mediocre facade views\\" of the winning design from the 2005 competition, was decisive for the reconstruction project of the new old town. \\"Unlike the second-place design ... which u. a. Paying tribute to the place with a multi-angle roof landscape, in the historical center of Frankfurt the \\"architectural sin\\" of the Technical Town Hall was to be replaced by the usual dreary cough of the real estate industry. \\"Only then did a dynamic develop,\\" in which the idea, tallest skyscrapers in continental Europe, building an \\"old\\" and \\"cozy\\" city suddenly became consensual\\".Enrico Santifaller: Die Frankfurter Altstadt hat viele Mütter und Väter, in: db–Deutsche Bauzeitung, 1. Juni 2018. Santifaller advocates avoiding ideological blinkers and \\"risking a second look\\".Enrico Santifaller: Ein Bisschen von Allem, in: db–Deutsche Bauzeitung, 1. Oktober 2018. Only through this was it possible to see, in addition to all banal re- creations and new creations, as well as detailed errors, the “subtle and not always legible references to breaks and discontinuity”, for example in the house of the three Romans or the building in Braubachstrasse 21. In his reply to Trüby's polemic, Matthias Alexander also points out that “reconstructions cannot be classified politically either on the right or on the left. They obtain their legitimation primarily from two sources: their craft quality and their civic acceptance. Both are given in Frankfurt“.Matthias Alexander: Neue Frankfurter Altstadt: Wir waren schon weiter. In: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 16. Mai 2018. Hanno Rauterberg contradicts the thesis that the reconstruction of the old town goes hand in hand with the erasure of history and guilt. The debate alone leads to more people thinking about the destruction and its background. On the other hand, “no one in Frankfurt felt reminded of the bomb war and Shoah when they saw the now demolished Technical Town Hall”. Most critics mocked questions of taste. \\"It is often said that this type of architecture is just a backdrop, untrue, inauthentic ... But architecture is always illusory ... Only in some residential and commercial areas, where every design claim is sacrificed, is the architecture really true\\".Hanno Rauterberg: Altstadt für alle! Frankfurt debattiert über rekonstruierte Bürgerhäuser, völkische Unterwanderung und die Zukunft der Schönheit. In: zeit.de, 16. Mai 2018. Even Laura Weißmüller emphasizes the quality and attention to detail with which the New Old Town was built. Starting with the planning and the careful construction, all parties involved, builders, architects, planners and construction companies pulled together in Frankfurt. \\"One would wish that so much attention to detail and care would be put into a construction project that did not pretend that the Second World War had never existed\\".Laura Weißmüller: Frankfurter Altstadt: Das Wirtschaftssystem entscheidet, wie gebaut wird. In: Süddeutsche Zeitung, 14. Mai 2018. Michael Guntersdorf talks to Matthias Alexander about his experiences with the Dom-Römer project. The project was essentially about city repair. One of the main benefits of the project is the recovery of Braubachstrasse. In the past 70 years, practically no urban space has emerged that has the quality of the new old town. The ensemble effect is even better than originally thought. Suddenly the architects are on the defensive and have a professional discussion about their health. One could learn from the project for future new building projects “that one needs more depth in dealing with architecture. It can no longer be about creating volume. You have to provide identification with special design elements. You have to put more effort into the details”. He opposes criticism that you could have built many social housing for the same money; this thinking is \\"totally limited\\". “It was a sensible investment, it brings the city forward. The foreigners in particular, who we led over the construction site, were of the opinion that the people of Frankfurt should have remembered their history as a European metropolis much earlier\\". He personally likes the two new buildings. Best with the Three Romans (Markt 40) and Großer Rebstock (Markt 8); the least successful are the Goldene Schachtel (Markt 32) and her neighbor Alter Burggraf.Im Gespräch: Michael Guntersdorf, Geschäftsführer der Dom-Römer GmbH, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 27. September 2018. Andreas Maier describes the New Old Town for the travel journal of the FAZ from the \\"most beautiful and useless place in Frankfurt\\", the Belvedere of the Golden Libra, \\"face to face with the cathedral tower\\".He knew Belvederchen, which was destroyed in 1944, from \\"illustrated books about old Frankfurt\\", which he studied as a young man, \\"the invocation of an era that is no longer imaginable, ... pure history ... Frankfurt as a possibility of total idyll\\". He then sits down First of all, basically with architectural reconstructions, using the example of the Dresden Zwinger, the Knochenhaueramtshaus and the Warsaw Old Town who kept the memory of their destruction in different ways. He recalls an earlier article that he wrote about the planned demolition of the Technical Town Hall and reconstructions in the old town for Die Zeit, and in which he made fun of the “half-timbered longing”, the “longing for a city like this looks like the cities that Frankfurt might like to visit as tourists”. After a tour of the construction site, however, he was impressed by the quality of the construction and also the architecture, and the enthusiasm of the craftsmen. He states: “Valuable materials, traditional craftsmanship, everything at its finest. With its new old town, which is also in the Manufactum Catalog, Frankfurt makes itself a gift. And there is the Belvederchen as praline on top\\". In addition to the Belvederchen, he is particularly impressed by the Schönau house (Market 10) “a very narrow thing with a slate facade pulled down deep… and a slightly convex curvature of the elegantly stepped front. Probably an absolutely unique piece\\".  Literature  = Summaries = * Matthias Alexander (Hrsg.): The new old town.

The Russians defeated him in an effort to pacify the Cherdyn Route, whereupon Ablegirim and his family were taken to Moscow as hostages. The fort of Pelym was built in 1592 on the site of his former residence by Prince Pyotr Gorchakov, a voivode from Cherdyn. Pelym was one of the first Russian settlements east of the Urals, marking the eastern terminus of the Cherdyn Road from Europe. A makeshift timber fort was brought down the river from Upper Lozva to Pelym in 1597. The builders took with them the family of Ignaty Khripunov—the first Russians to be exiled to Siberia.Lantzeff and Peirce.

The earliest depiction of this tree in America is in the Florentine Codex. In the 17th century, Francisco Hernández commented: \\"The juice from the flowers of this tree, given to children induces drowsiness and sleepless\\". Other sites explain that although the flower is edible, the seeds and everything else in the tree is highly toxic, in Mexico, the grounded seeds are used as rat poison and the bark is used as fish poison. Uses The flower is edible, This tree is very popular with kids who use the flowers as a little knives to stab each other. The ground seeds and bark are used as poison, The tree is also used to make traditional crafts in many Mexican states, specially traditional dance masks and is also used as fence post in many parts of Veracruz Mexico, it is a beautiful and hardy tree, some varieties even tolerate frost. The tall varieties of this plant are rarely used as a garden plant, but the dwarf varieties are used as garden plants because they tolerate frost, they tolerate heat and come from dry places, and they flower early and attract hummingbirds.

Built in 1901 by a local farmer, it is an architecturally eclectic mix of Greek Revival, Colonial Revival and Queen Anne styling. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Corban Farwell Homestead is located in a rural setting west of the village center of Harrisville, at the junction of Breed and Cricket Hill roads in the town's Silver Lake area. It is a -story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The house is distinctive as a late example of Greek Revival architecture, albeit with a number of Colonial Revival features added, as well as bands of scalloped wood shingles typical of the Queen Anne style. An enclosed porch runs across one facade and along part of another, and the main block is joined to a large carriage house. Corban Farwell built this house in 1901 on land that had been held among interrelated families since the 18th century. He was a purveyor of farm supplies, selling fresh milk and eggs to the summer residents of the resort community that sprang up around nearby Silver Lake. He also sold land along the lakeshore for expanding that development.

D.Müll.-Doblies & U.Müll.-Doblies, Feddes Repert. 105: 358 (1994) After being included in the genus Boophone for many decades, Crossyne was raised to genus status in the 1990s, most conspicuously on the basis that: * Crossyne leaves undergo the following characteristic metamorphosis, the seedling starting from paired, small, lorate leaves growing more or less erect among competing low vegetation. From the age of some four to six years however, the bulbs become large enough to produce broad, flat, prostrate leaves that compete well for space by growing over small neighbours. In this they differ from Boophone species, that grow more erectly, with distichous leaves. * The leaf margins of Crossyne are completely fringed with straight short bristles, typically 1 cm or so in length, in one or more rows; Boophone leaves are completely glabrous. * In both genera the bulb commonly grows to a mass of well over a kilogram, but the bulbs of Crossyne do not extend above ground at all unless because of erosion or similar factors, whereas Boophone bulbs tend to project perhaps halfway above the ground, depending on circumstances. General biology If not disturbed, which in the wild they seldom are, being dangerously poisonous, the bulbs grow for decades at least. As the bulb grows larger it produces more leaves, some six or eight in a season when mature. The leaves grow in a radial arrangement around the top of the bulb, emerging from a flat slit. The leaves are a decorative dark green, coriaceous in texture and mottled or spotted beneath, especially near the base. The margins of the leaves of all ages are elegantly ciliate, being fringed with eyelash-like bristles. The plant is strictly deciduous and endemic to a mainly winter-rainfall, partly semi-arid, region; the leaves emerging near the time of the first rains, about when the plant sheds the infructescence. The leaves dry out, curl up somewhat and detach towards late springtime or mid-summer, leaving little sign of the whereabouts of the dormant, buried bulb. If torn, whether live or as yet undecayed, the leaves dried sap forms silky threads that in past times cattle herders used to apply to bleeding cuts as a styptic.

He was minister plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands in Brussels under Empress Maria Theresia from 1753 until his death in 1770. Flowers in a Vase, painted by Jan Davidszoon de Heem. This painting formed a part of the collection of Count Karl von Cobenzl in Brussels which was bought by Catherine the Great in 1768. The painting is currently on view in the Hermitage Museum. Life Cobenzl was born in 1712 in Laibach, the capital of the Duchy of Carniola in the Habsburg Empire (present-day Ljubljana, Slovenia) as the son of Johann Caspar von Cobenzl (1664-1742), Imperial councillor and his second wife Carolina Sophia von Rindsmaul (1682-1756), and thus a member of the Austrian Von Cobenzl family. He studied in Leiden and Würzburg and subsequently became treasurer of the emperor in 1730. Five years later, in 1735, he was appointed Imperial councillor, in succession of his father. From 1738 onward, he was committed to solve the boundary problems between Upper Lorraine and Lower Lorraine. During the reign of Empress Maria Theresia he was travelling as an envoy throughout the Habsburg Empire solving all kinds of problems. On 19 May 1753, Cobenzl was appointed minister plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands in Brussels by Empress Maria Theresia. His predecessor was Antoniotto Botta Adorno who then became Prime minister of Tuscany. In 1759, Cobenzl was appointed member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Cobenzl's long term in office as minister plenipotentiary is seen as a successful period, although he constantly had to struggle with lack of money. Well noted is his strong ambition for arts and culture throughout his life and he collected a huge amount of art.Collection of Count Cobenzl, Brussels at arthermitage.org In 1768 in Brussels Catherine the Great bought the collections of Count Karl von Cobenzl and Prince Charles de Ligne which are now displayed in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.Collecting at the Russian court in the 18th century, hermitagemuseum.orgRubens and His Age: Treasures from the Hermitage Museum, culturekiosque.com In 1769, a 'literary society' was established by Count Johann Karl Philipp von Cobenzl in Brussels, initially led by Johann Daniel Schöpflin and with regard to its resources mainly based on the vast collection of books and manuscripts of the library of the Burgundian dukes. These books and manuscripts were saved from destruction by fire when the Coudenberg Palace, the residence of the archdukes, burnt down in 1731. However, shortly after the foundation of the society, Cobenzl died in Brussels in January 1770 at the age of 57. Georg Adam, Prince of Starhemberg (1724-1807) became his successor as minister plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands. Starhemberg continued the efforts of his predecessor in Brussels by transforming Cobenzl's 'literary society' in 1772 into the 'Imperial and Royal Academy of Brussels' with the approval of Empress Maria Theresia.History, at kvab.be (in English) Private life On 24 November 1734, Johann Karl Philipp von Cobenzl married Maria Theresia Katharina Walburga Pálffy ab Erdöd (1719 - 1771),Marriage of Johann Karl Philipp Raphael Daniel von Cobenzl and Maria Theresia Katharina Walburga Palffy d'Erdod, at geni com a granddaughter of Imperial field marshal Johann Bernhard Stephan, Graf Pálffy ab Erdöd (1664 - 1751). Ten children stemmed from this marriage, among them his famous son Johann Ludwig, Graf von Cobenzl, born in 1753.Cobenzl, Ludwig (ADB), at deutsche-biographie.de (in German) Karl von Cobenzl was a proponent of Enlightenment and a crucial figure for the promotion and support of Enlightenment in the Habsburg Netherlands.

This first racing meet in North America was supervised by New York's colonial governor, Richard Nicolls. The area is now occupied by the present Nassau County, New York, region of Greater Westbury and East Garden City. Horse racing remains a popular sport throughout the United States. Thoroughbred racing in the United States The American Stud Book was started in 1868, prompting the beginning of organized horse racing in the United States. Horse racing, especially thoroughbred racing, was a sport enjoyed by all during the progressive era. According to Steven A. Reiss \\" Thoroughbred racing was the rare sport that was trending with both social and economic elites and the lower classes\\". Horse racing was an enamored sport that was popular for its time in all regions of the United States and took a downturn for a while as the economy, gambling reformers and some interest faded. Reiss states that post-Civil War America was the rebirth of the horse racing sport and it relied on the status of men who bred and raced horses and operated jockey clubs and racetracks. \\"The powerful alliance between urban machine politicians and racetrack owners enabled thoroughbred racing in New York to flourish for about for forty-five years without interruption\\". Horse racing endured several ups and downs throughout the era to include socioeconomic status, political gain, morality imposition or just a mere stronghold for the pleasure of the sport. There were 314 tracks operating in the United States by 1890; and in 1894, the American Jockey Club was formed.\\"History of Horse Racing.\\" WinningPonies.com. April 7, 2009. The anti-gambling sentiment prevalent in the early 20th century led almost all states to ban bookmaking. Bookmaking is the process of taking bets, calculating odds, and paying out winnings.

Other more recently opened tracks include Remington Park, Oklahoma City, opened in 1988, and Lone Star Park in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex, opened in 1997; the latter track hosted the prestigious Breeders' Cup series of races in 2004. The Thoroughbred horse racing in the United States Hall of Fame is in Saratoga Springs, New York. The Hall of Fame honors remarkable horses, jockeys, owners, and trainers. In North America, most racehorses are stabled in the backstretch of the racetrack at which their trainers are based. The backstretch has extensive facilities to house the horses and workers. Types of racing Del Mar In the United States, Thoroughbred flat races are run on either dirt, synthetic or turf surfaces. Other tracks offer Quarter Horse racing and Standardbred horse racing, or combinations of these three types of racing surfaces. Racing with other breeds, such as Arabian horse racing, is found on a limited basis. American Thoroughbred races are run at a wide variety of distances, most commonly from . The shorter distances are more common but the mid-to-long distance races tend to be higher in prestige. With this in mind, breeders of Thoroughbred race horses attempt to breed horses that excel at a particular distance (see Dosage Index). The Pleasanton Fairgrounds Racetrack at the Alameda County Fairgrounds is the oldest horse racing track in America, dating back to 1858, when it was founded by the sons of the Spaniard Don Agustin Bernal. =Flat racing= In 1665, the first racetrack was constructed on Long Island. It is the oldest Thoroughbred race in North America. The American Stud Book was started in 1868, prompting the beginning of organized horse racing in the United States.

Thoroughbred horse racing in the United States has its own Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. The Hall of Fame honors remarkable horses, jockeys, owners, and trainers. =Endurance racing= The length of an endurance race varies greatly. Some are very short, only ten miles, while others can be up to one hundred miles. There are a few races that are even longer than one hundred miles and last multiple days.\\"Endurance Riding\\" Equiworld.net. April 8, 2009 These different lengths of races are divided into five categories: pleasure rides (10–20 miles), non-competitive trail rides (21–27 miles), competitive trail rides (20–45 miles), progressive trail rides (25–60 miles), and endurance rides (40–100 miles in one day, up to in multiple days). Because each race is very long, trails of natural terrain are generally used. The longest endurance race in the world is the Mongol Derby, which is 620 miles (1000 km) long. =Arabian horse= The Arabian horse was developed by the Bedouin people of the Middle East specifically for stamina over long distances, so they could outrun their enemies. It was not until 1725 that the Arabian was introduced into the United States. Arabians appeared in the United States in colonial times, though were not bred as purebreds until about the time of the Civil War. Until the formation of the Arabian Horse Registry of America in 1908, Arabians were recorded with the Jockey Club in a separate subsection from Thoroughbreds. They must be able to withstand traveling long distances at a moderate pace. Arabians have an abundance of Type I fibers. Their muscles are able to work for extended periods of time. Also, the muscles of the Arabian are not nearly as massive as those of the Quarter Horse, which allow it to travel longer distances at quicker speeds. The Arabian is primarily used today in endurance racing, but is also raced over traditional race tracks in many countries. Arabian Horse Racing is governed by IFAHR (The International Federation of Arabian Horse Racing Authorities). =Quarter horse= The ancestors of the Quarter Horse were prevalent in America in the early 17th century. These horses were a blend of Colonial Spanish horses crossed English horses that were brought over in the 1700s. The native horse and the English horse were bred together, resulting in a compact muscular horse. At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work. The American Quarter Horse was not recognized as an official breed until the formation of the American Quarter Horse Association in 1940.\\"Quarter Horse History\\" Essortment.com April 8, 2009 In order to be successful in racing, Quarter Horses need to be able to propel themselves forward at extremely fast sprinter speed. The Quarter Horse has much larger hind limb muscles than the Arabian, which make it much less suitable for endurance racing.Crook, T.C., et al. \\"Comparative Anatomy and Muscle Architecture of Selected Hind Limb Muscles in the Quarter Horse and Arab. \\" Journal of Anatomy February 2008: 144–152. Academic Search Complete EBSCO. University of Arizona Library, Tucson, AZ. March 4, 2009 They also have more Type II-b fibers, which allow the Quarter Horse to accelerate rapidly. When Quarter Horse racing began, it was very expensive to lay a full mile of track so it was agreed that a straight track of four hundred meters, or one quarter of a mile would be laid instead.\\"Quarter Horse Racing\\" HorseRacing.com. The Horse Racing Channel. March 13, 2009 It became the standard racing distance for Quarter Horses and inspired their name. With the exception of the longer, distance contests, Quarter Horse races are run flat out, with the horses running at top speed for the duration. There is less jockeying for position, as turns are rare, and many races end with several contestants grouped together at the wire. The track surface is similar to that of Thoroughbred racing and usually consists of dirt. Important races The traditional high point of US horse racing is the Kentucky Derby, held on the first Saturday of May at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Together, the Derby; the Preakness Stakes, held two weeks later at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland; and the Belmont Stakes, held three weeks after the Preakness at Belmont Park on Long Island, form the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing for three-year-olds. They are all held early in the year, throughout May and the beginning of June. The Breeders' Cup event is held in late October or early November at different race tracks every year. It receives less attention than the Triple Crown series from the general public but is of great importance in determining the American Horse of the Year and annual Eclipse Award divisional winners. It is normally held at a different track every year, though some racetracks have held back-to-back renewals. It currently consists of thirteen races held over two days with total prize-money of $28 million, with the Breeders' Cup Classic being the most prestigious. The richest horse race in the United States is the Pegasus World Cup, held in late January at Gulfstream Park in Florida since 2017. There are also a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers and a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters, as well as an Arabian Triple Crown consisting of Drinkers of the Wind Derby in California, the Texas Six Shooter Stakes, the Bob Magness Derby in Delaware. Also, the main Standardbred event is the Breeders Crown. Thoroughbred and Arabian fillies have their own \\"Triple\\" series, commonly referred to as The Triple Tiara. While there is some disagreement over which three races make up the Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing, the Arabian list is more formal and consists of Daughters of the Desert Oaks in California, the Texas Yellow Rose Stakes, and the Cre Run Oaks in Delaware. Betting American betting on horse racing is sanctioned and regulated by the state the racetrack is located in. Simulcast betting almost always exist across state lines with no oversight except the companies involved through legalized parimutuel gambling. A takeout, or \\"take\\", is removed from each betting pool and distributed according to state law, among the state, race track and horsemen. On average, 17 percent is withheld from win, place and show pools, with 83 percent being returned to the winning players. A variety of factors affect takeout, namely location and the type of wager that is placed. For example, one regional track circuit in the United States has four different takeout rates for different types of bets with a total blended rate that exceeds 20 percent. Advanced deposit wagering Advanced deposit wagering is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a cut of ADW revenues. It typically involves betting on horse or greyhound racing. Wagering may take place through parimutuel pools.

'Francis Edmunds' - Biographischer Eintrag in der Online-Dokumentation der anthroposophischen ‘’Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls’’ Biography =Early years= Louis Francis Edmunds was born into an orthodox Russian-Jewish family. His mother died when he was two years of age, whereupon his father emigrated to the United Kingdom, leaving Francis in the care of his grandparents until he was of an age to start school in England. He then joined his father in London, who had since acquired a second family with the sister of his first wife. On leaving school, Francis distanced himself from the faith of his family and embarked on a study of Medicine. From 1922-24 he was part of a Quaker mission to Russia, distributing emergency rations on horseback to the starving farming population during the Bolshevik Revolution. On returning to England, his interests having switched from Medicine to Education, he was sent to a Quaker Friends School in Lebanon, and later taught at the International School in Geneva, Switzerland. =Steiner education= Through a friend he was introduced to Rudolf Steiner’s Anthroposophy, studied briefly at the Goetheanum in Dornach and became a member of the Anthroposophical Society in 1930. In England once again, he took up contact with the teachers of “The New School” (today Michael Hall) that had been founded in Streatham, South London in 1925. In 1932 he was asked to take on the first grade, which soon led to various other responsibilities in the school. In 1936 his colleagues asked him to direct what was to become the Michael Hall Teacher Training Course, the first organised Steiner training in Britain, which he ran for years besides his teaching work. During World War II, the school, now called Michael Hall, was evacuated to Minehead in Somerset. Here Edmunds began to write the Michael Hall News and held many lectures for the soldiers stationed there to guard the coastline. After the War the school moved to Kidbrooke Hall Forest Row in Sussex. It was then that he began to travel extensively, mainly to the United States, in order to help the Waldorf Schools in those parts to develop. Besides this, he and his wife Elizabeth for many years ran the school hostel, living together with the boarders in Kidbrooke Mansion with their own three children. Concerned that the British Steiner schools begin consequentially to work together he founded and was chairman of the \\"Steiner Schools Fellowship” for many years. =Emerson College= Finally, in 1962, he was able to found an adult education centre for Anthroposophy which he named Emerson College after the American Transcendentalist philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson. He was able to attract a number of inspiring lecturers to work at the college with him, including John Davy, Michael Wilson, William Mann, Anthony Kay, Gerhard Koepf and his wife Elizabeth. The college offered a Foundation Year in Anthroposophy followed by a further year in either Education, Biodynamics or various arts. By the 1979’s it had an annual enrollment of around 200 students. In the last years of his life Edmunds began to write the books, particularly on Waldorf Education, that have become well known introductory works into these concepts. A series of audio sessions, conducted by William Hearst II and recorded by John Swain, are available at SensingTheTruth.org. These recordings span approximately 7 hours over 4 sessions, and present an extended conversation with Edmunds on a variety of topics.

While the first installations date back to the late 19th century, modern, larger scale implementations are still being manufactured by several manufacturers, as Madhouse (by Vekoma) or Mystery Swing (by Mack Rides).  Illusion  The illusion is created by separating the movement of the swing occupants sit on, and the room that surrounds them. While the swing barely moves, the room can fully rotate around the occupants. As this room is the only frame of reference visitors have, it appears as if they are turning upside down. This principle is known as vection.  History  Patent drawing showing the working of the haunted swing illusion. A patent for the ride was granted in 1893 to Amariah Lake (1836-1922), an inventor from Atlantic City, New Jersey, who was also credited with the invention of several other amusement rides. The patent describes \\"an apparatus (...) of such nature that the occupants (...) will be subject to the illusion that they are swinging to an extreme height, or even that the swing is turning completely over\\". The first haunted swings were opened around 1894 at the Atlantic City Boardwalk and the 1894 Midwinter Fair in San Francisco. In Germany, the Hexenschaukel (Witches' Swing) opened later that year, a ride that is still operating today. = Ride experience = Several accounts of the ride experience at the first installations exist. The rooms were furnished with chairs, tables, curtains, paintings, a stroller, an iron safe and a piano, which were secured to the walls or ceiling. The illusion is further enhanced by an electric light disguised as a petroleum light, which would be unable to function when inverted. Visitors were seated on a swing that was hanging from a metal pipe. Sources disagree about the swing's capacity, ranging from 12 persons to 20 or even 40 or more. After visitors were seated, an attendant would give the swing a small push and leave the room. The attendant would start manually rotating the room from the outside, giving riders the illusion that the swinging was increasing. Finally, the room would fully rotate several times and come to a halt. Wood described his experience on the haunted swing at the Midwinter Fair in San Francisco. He reported several riders suffering from dizziness and nausea. = Madhouse = Inside of the Villa Volta ride. In 1996, the illusion was reinvented in the amusement ride Villa Volta in Efteling theme park in the Netherlands. Built by Vekoma, this ride differed in the much larger capacity (78 persons) and the fact that the swing was also actuated, instead of passively swinging. Several rides of this type have since be built by Vekoma under the name Madhouse. Since 2000, Mack Rides produces a similar ride as Mystery Swing.

The organization also promotes the benefits of locally produced honey to South African honey consumers, and provides marketing opportunities. Beekeepers that partner with African Honey Bee are provided with training, mentoring and support; low cost infrastructure, equipment, consumables and logistics; and off-take agreements/partnerships with large retailers. African Honey Bee is able to guarantee its product quality to the consumer, because it requires the beekeepers to manage their bees according to its Afri-hive organic beekeeping system, its Nektar management and traceability technology, and its quality standards, as well as being managed and mentored by an African Honey Bee senior beekeeper. Prospective beekeepers from rural areas, generally between the ages of 18 – 26, spend 18 months in an incubation programme, during which time they are officially employed by the incubator as salaried working interns. During their incubation, the interns complete an African Honey Bee developed program in beekeeping. They work under guidance of senior beekeepers on an African Honey Bee commercial bee farm. The interns are also assisted to start their own beekeeping business on a small scale, with the view of increasing it once they complete the incubation process. At the end of their incubation, the beekeepers automatically become shareholders in African Honey Bee Kruger Park (Pty) Ltd, the main operating entity of the group, through a stakeholder Trust. A beekeeper development Trust (that owns 10% of the equity in African Honey Bee Kruger Park Pty Ltd) raises grant funding to provide support to partner beekeepers in the form of mentorship, training, logistics, access to low cost equipment and consumables. African Honey Bee's first incubator, Bushbuckridge, began operations in April 2013.\\"New Lowveld Honey Project is Sweet News\\" . Community Work Programme, Government of South Africa. Honey harvested from the incubation farms and procured from partner beekeepers, is transported to a central processing plant where it is strained, bottled, labelled, packaged and dispatched for distribution. African Honey Bee's Nektar management and traceability technology will allow consumers to trace their batch of honey back to the beekeeper that produced it and see on Google Earth where it comes from. The African Beekeeper Trust (development trust) has been registered as an NPO and PBO, providing African Honey Bee with a vehicle to raise grant funding for, and manage beekeeper development.

It started in Cherdyn west of the Urals and followed a number of rivers and portages, from the Vishera through the Lozva and the Tavda to the Tobol River. Around 1580, Yermak and his Cossacks ascended the Chusovaya River and crossed to the Barancha, a tributary of the Tagil River. They succeeded in penetrating the Khanate of Siberia and conquering the area. This route was abandoned because the upper Tagil was too shallow. In 1592, the Russian fort of Pelym was built to guard the eastern terminus of the Cherdyn Road.

Built in 1911 and expanded in 1916-17, the estate is one of the most sophisticated and elaborate summer estates built in the Harrisville-Dublin area during its heyday as a summer resort area. The estate is located off MacVeagh Road, south of its junction with Mason Road. Its builders were Charles MacVeagh and Fanny Davenport Rogers MacVeagh. He is notable for being United States Ambassador to Japan, and they were the parents of diplomat Lincoln MacVeagh. The estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description The MacVeaghs became interested in the Harrisville-Dublin area after visiting his uncle Franklin's estate of Knollwood. With an interest in their Scottish heritage, the MacVeaghs named their estate after a place associated with Mrs. MacVeagh's family, and built a recreation of a medieval country estate on a hill side with views of Mount Monadnock. The design inspiration of the main house is said to be Kelmscott Manor in England, the Scottish Fasnacloich having burned in the 19th century. It is a two-story masonry construction, with clusters of chimneys typical of Jacobean houses, and a slate roof. The window frames and wooden trim of the house were made of wood cut on the property. The house is in an asymmetrical U shape, with the base of the U long, and arms of (south) and (north). The house is approached by a long drive that ends in a circular are in front of the eastern facade, which has two entries sheltered by porches. The interior of the main wing includes an entry hall, three bedrooms, and a grand hall on the ground floor, whose walls are finished in half-timbering filled with stucco. The south wing houses a library and another large room, the two story \\"Terrace Room\\", which measures by , and was used as a performance space. It is three fireplaces and three monumentally large windows made of small leaded panes; these windows stand under steeply pitched gables. The south wing is connected to the north wing via a cloister-like walkway along the west side of the main wing. The north wing houses the kitchen, servant work areas, a large dining room, and smoking room on the first floor. There is an Episcopal chapel on the second floor. To the north of this wing is the 1916-17 addition, with a greatly expanded library. Bookcases line the walls, separated by paired Tuscan columns in this room, which measures . The most prominent feature of the estate's landscaping is the four-level terrace that extends down the hill from the south wing. The top level has a fieldstone retaining wall topped by a balustrade with Jacobean balusters. The garden descends to the fourth level, where there is an octagonal pool at whose center is fountain imported from Italy. History Plans for the house were drafted by A. S. Bell, although credit for most of its design and decoration go to Fanny MacVeagh. The MacVeaghs are known to have had as guests a wide variety of acquaintances from political, social, artistic, and literary circles.

January 21, 942Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.), nickname Tiehu (), was a major general of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Later Jin. Late in the reign of Later Jin's founding emperor Shi Jingtang, An, discontented with the friendly relations between Later Jin and the Khitan Liao state, often provoked Liao and eventually decided to rebel against Later Jin. He was quickly defeated, however, and then was killed by his own subordinates.  Background  It is not known when An Chongrong was born. His family was from Shuo Prefecture (朔州, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi). His grandfather An Congyi () served as the prefect of Li Prefecture (利州, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan), while his father An Quan () served as the prefect of Sheng Prefecture (勝州, in modern Ordos, Inner Mongolia) and the commander of the infantry and cavalry soldiers at Zhenwu Circuit (振武, then probably headquartered in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). An Chongrong himself was said to be strong and good at both archery and horsemanship.Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 98.  During Later Tang  During the Changxing era (930-933) of the Later Tang emperor Li Siyuan, An Chongrong served as a military commander at Zhenwu (which was then headquartered in modern Shuozhou). He had once committed an offense and was imprisoned, and then-military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenwu, Gao Xingzhou, wanted to put him to death. An Chongrong's mother went to the Later Tang imperial government, then located at Luoyang, to appeal for his life. Li Siyuan's chief of staff An Chonghui protected An Chongrong, and An Chongrong was not put to death. It was not known what the aftermaths of that incident exactly were, but apparently at some point An Chongrong was free and became an officer at Zhenwu again. In 936, Shi Jingtang (Li Siyuan's son-in-law), the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) rebelled against then-emperor Li Congke (Li Siyuan's adoptive son).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. He sent his officer Zhang Ying () to entice An Chongrong to join his rebellion. Both An Chongrong's older brother and mother tried to stop him from doing so, and tried to kill Zhang. However, An Chongrong persuaded his older brother and mother that if he could use two arrows to hit targets 100 steps away, they would be signs that Shi would become emperor and that he would be a military governor. He then hit the targets, so his older brother and mother allowed him to take his soldiers and join Shi's army.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 51. Shi was pleased, and promised him that he would be made a military governor. An subsequently served under Shi's general Liu Zhiyuan in defending Hedong's capital Taiyuan against the siege by the Later Tang general Zhang Jingda, whom Li Congke sent to attack Shi.  During Later Jin  Shi Jingtang sought aid from Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire, promising to cede 16 prefectures to the north to the Khitan if the Khitan would support him as the emperor of China. Khitan's Emperor Taizong agreed and, in fall 936, arrived at Taiyuan and crushed Zhang Jingda's troops. He then declared Shi emperor of a new state of Later Jin. The joint Khitan/Later Jin forces then advanced toward Luoyang. Believing defeat to be inevitable, Li Congke committed suicide with his family, ending Later Tang. Shi entered Luoyang and took over the Later Tang lands. During the transition from Later Tang to Later Jin, the Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) officer Mi Qiong () used the opportunity to seize control of the circuit (with Chengde's military governor Dong Wenqi ()'s having been captured by the Khitan) while trying to aid Zhang). In spring 937, Shi commissioned An Chongrong as the military governor of Chengde and Mi as the defender of Qi Prefecture (齊州, in modern Jinan, Shandong), sending An to seize control from Mi. He also first sent the officer Wang Jingchong to Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture () to persuade Mi to submit, while sending the Khitan officer Zhao Siwen () with An to intimidate Mi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. However, he secretly told An, \\"If Mi Qiong refuses to receive you, I will give you a different circuit. Do not forcibly seize the circuit, in case it creates other problems.\\" This caused An to lose respect for Shi, believing that if Shi was easily intimidated by Mi — viewed by An to be an aged administrator — then he himself could more easily intimidate the emperor with his military abilities.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Mi did not dare to resist An, however, and he allowed An to take control of the circuit and departed himself for Qi. (Mi was subsequently ambushed and killed by Fan Yanguang the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), as Fan had unsuccessfully tried to persuade Mi into a joint rebellion against Later Jin and feared that Mi would leak the news, and was also enticed by the wealth — which Mi gained by killing Dong's family and seizing Dong's wealth — that Mi was carrying.) At Chengde, An was said to be diligent — whereas the other military governors of the time often took bribes and ruled according to the amount of bribes they received, An was attentive to the administration of laws and often used logic in ruling on cases. His subordinates therefore also did not dare to receive bribes. There was one occasion when a couple was claiming that their son was not filially pious. An gave the father a sword and said, \\"Kill him yourself.\\" The father wept and stated, \\"I do not have the heart to do so.\\" The mother cursed at the father and took the sword herself, chasing the father away. An, finding this illogical, inquired further, and found out that she was a stepmother, not the son's birth mother. He chased her out and then shot her to death with an arrow. This much impressed the people of the realm, and he initially enjoyed popularity. As a result, however, he became arrogant, and he began to gather troops, believing that he could seek the throne (just as Li Congke and Shi did), stating, \\"The Son of Heaven's throne is based on those who have strong armies and healthy horses, not based on preordination.\\" However, the people began to see him as overly harsh when, on one occasion, he, out of anger, killed his officer Jia Zhang () on false excuse of Jia's committing treason, and slaughtered Jia's entire household, except for Jia's daughter. Jia's daughter, however, did not want to live alone, and sought to share her father's fate, so he killed her as well. Part of the territory that Shi ceded to the Khitan (which, by this point, has renamed their state Liao) included territory inhabited by the Tuyuhun tribespeople. The Tuyuhun were mistreated by the Liao. An enticed them to join his army, and so large Tuyuhun contingents fled to his territory in or about 940. Subsequently, Emperor Taizong angrily rebuked Shi, and Shi, under Liao pressure, forcibly expelled the Tuyuhun and sent them back to Liao. This aggravated An, who had long been (at least publicly) ashamed of how Shi had submitted to Emperor Taizong, not only as subject, but also titularly as son. (However, despite public protestations against Liao, he was also in secret communications with the Liao military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), Liu Xi () He himself was arrogant to Liao emissaries whenever they passed through Chengde, and, if they were particularly distasteful to him, would kill them. In 941, he submitted a lengthy, public petition to Shi, in which he urged, in harsh terms, the repudiation of the alliance with Liao. He also wrote letters with similar contents to the important officials at the imperial court and the military governors throughout the Later Jin realm. Shi's advisor Sang Weihan, then the military governor of Taining Circuit (泰寧, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong), wrote him and suggested that he (Shi) head to Yedu (鄴都, Tianxiong's capital) and take up court there, so that he could react quickly if An did rebel. Shi did so. Once he reached Yedu, he wrote An, stating: The letter, however, did not change An's mind, and he became even more arrogant. He also heard that An Congjin the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei) was also planning to rebel against Shi, and therefore sent secret messengers establishing an alliance with An Congjin. At the same time, Shi sent Liu Zhiyuan to Hedong to serve as its military governor, to also monitor the situation with An. Liu enticed the Tuyuhun chieftain Bai Chengfu (), who had previously submitted to An Chongrong, into joining the Hedong army with his tribesmen. That, and the failure of Dada and Qibi () tribesmen to join An Chongrong (as he had claimed that they would), hampered the impact of An's public pronouncements. Nevertheless, when An Congjin shortly after rebelled against Later Jin, An Chongrong resolved to rebel anyway. Shi sent his brother-in-law Du Chongwei against An Chongrong, with Ma Quanjie () serving as Du's deputy. When the armies encountered each other, An's officer Zhao Yanzhi () surrendered to Du (although he was nevertheless killed after the surrender), causing a general rout of An's army. An fled back to Zhen and took up defense there. In spring 942, a Chengde officer opened a water gate and allowed Du's army into the city, and An was captured and executed. Shi had An's head painted (for preservation) and delivered it to Emperor Taizong.

He is a broker at Douglas Elliman, the largest real estate brokerage in the New York Metropolitan area and the fourth largest real estate company in the United States. He is known for brokering high-end luxury real estate to a celebrity clientele and is a star of the HGTV reality television show Selling New York. Early life and education Postilio was born and raised in Queens, New York City. He was part of the first class to attend the prestigious Townsend Harris High School when it reopened in 1984. His family moved from Ozone Park, Queens to Hauppauge, Long Island and he graduated from Hauppauge High School in 1988, where he performed in many of the school's musicals. He became a fan of Frank Sinatra at an early age and entered talent shows singing songs made famous by the legendary crooner. Postilio won the Newsday Teen Talent Showcase in 1987 and was featured in the New York Times when he was 19 years old. He graduated from Suffolk County Community College with an associate degree in 1990, but opted not to further his college education when he was invited to tour as the featured vocalist with the Glenn Miller Orchestra at the age of 20. Real estate career Postilio was a founding member of CORE, a New York real estate firm, and has been ranked as one of the top real estate agents in New York City. He entered the real estate profession in 2003 at the suggestion of a friend. He was hired by Shaun Osher of Douglas Elliman, the largest residential real estate brokerage in the New York metropolitan area. In 2005, Postilio and Osher left Elliman to start a new real estate brokerage, which would become CORE. In 2015, Postilio and his partner Mickey Conlon joined Douglas Elliman, the No. 1 real estate brokerage in New York. Company chairman Howard Lorber stated that, \\"Tom & Mickey are two of the brightest superstars in the business,\\" with company president and CEO Dottie Herman adding they were, \\"well-respected for their collective experience, trusted business relationships and cultural and social influences, Tom and Mickey are true leaders in their field.\\" Postilio was ranked among the top 1000 Real Estate Professionals in the United States by REAL Trends/The Wall Street Journal. Postilio is known for working with high-net-worth celebrity clients such as Jim Carrey, Joan Collins, Michael Feinstein, Lady Gaga, and David Sanborn. He became a star on Selling New York, a reality show on HGTV that features brokers selling high-end real estate to some of New York's wealthiest residents. He frequently appears alongside his partner, Mickey Conlon, and the duo have been dubbed the show's \\"Dream Team.\\" Responsible for more than $1.5 billion in residential sales, they rank among the most successful real estate brokers in the United States and were named CORE's top-producing agents in 2013 and 2014. Postilio has appeared on numerous television shows as a real estate commentator and host, including CBS's Living Large, Fox's Good Day New York, NBC's Open House, ABC's Good Morning America, and CNBC's Mega Homes Report. He has also been featured in articles in several publications, including The New York Times, New York Daily News, the New York Post, the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, The Hollywood Reporter, and a variety of real estate trade publications. Postilio has been designated a Certified Negotiations Expert by the Real Estate Board of New York, of which he is a member. He was appointed as a juror for the Architzer A+ Awards, the world's largest architectural awards program. After Donald Trump announced he would run for president, Postilio appeared with Conlon on Inside Edition to discuss Trump's first mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, which was listed for $54 million, $50 million more than Trump paid for the estate when he bought it in 1982. In 2007, Postilio was at the center of a story that made international headlines about the astronomical pricing for parking spaces in New York City. Based on the sale and waiting list for parking spaces in the basement of a boutique luxury condominium project at 246 West 17th Street in Manhattan's pricey Chelsea neighborhood, the record price tags of $275,000 were compared to the cost of cars, home values, and income levels around the world. Still, the cost of such spaces was justified as valuable by residents and industry economists based on the lack of available parking in the city and a decline in the number of parking garages in New York City. As of late 2014, prices for some parking spaced in Manhattan have exceeded $1 million. Singing career Before getting involved in real estate, Postilio began his career as a singer of the Great American Songbook and traveled internationally with the Glenn Miller Orchestra. He traveled with the group for one year, playing in venues in Europe, Asia and the United States. He received a MAC Award for Outstanding New York Debut as well as the Backstage Bistro Award for Outstanding Vocalist. Postilio sang in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel and was noted for his Frank Sinatra singing style, with the New York Times stating \\"his carefully syncopated phrasing and exuberance suggest a softened echo of the late-50s Sinatra in his swinging mode.\\" He released two albums in the 1990s: What Matters Most (Elba, 1993) and Dream (DRG, 1998). Upon seeing his performance in 1998, Regis Philbin stated on ABC TV's Regis & Kathie Lee, \\"he looks and sounds like a young Sinatra.\\" His acclaim as a Sinatra-style singer led to his starring role in the Off- Broadway musical, Our Sinatra. He has appeared on The Today Show, PBS Great Performances, Showbiz Tonight, and BBC News. Postilio returned to the nightclub stage in 2011 with his show \\"This Time Around\\", performed at Feinstein's at Loews Regency in New York.

One of the largest medieval bridges in Britain, it is a Grade I listed building and ancient monument. Another major medieval bridge, the Bideford Long Bridge over the Torridge, is a few miles away. History The date of the first bridge as Barnstaple's main bridge across the River Taw is unclear. A will of 1274 left money for its upkeep and it underwent construction work around 1280 with further work being undertaken in 1333, and the bridge was partially destroyed in 1437 and 1646. It is unclear whether all of the arches were originally built of stone or whether three were wooden (known as \\"maiden Arches\\") until replacement in the 16th century. In 1796, the bridge was widened again. The footpath was added in the 1830s and cast iron used to strengthen the bridge under the direction of James Green. In the 1960s some of the original stonework of the deck was replaced with concrete faced with masonry, above the original stone arches, removing the Victorian ironworks to give the bridge an image identical to how it would have looked between 1796 and 1832. Traffic congestion was considerable on the bridge until, in May 2007, the Barnstaple Western Bypass was opened so traffic heading towards Braunton and Ilfracombe avoids travelling through the town centre over the ancient bridge. The bypass consists of of new road and a , five-span bridge. It was expected to have cost £42 million. In 2016 plans were announced to upgrade the bridge including widening of footpaths and the creation of cycle lanes.

He is the protagonist of the short film of the same name and appears on the production logo of every Pixar film where he hops on screen and bounces on the letter I. John Lasseter created Luxo Jr., modeling the character after his own Luxo brand lamp. The manufacturer of Luxo lamps sued Disney, the parent company of Pixar, for selling Luxo Jr. branded merchandise in 2009. Creation John Lasseter used a Luxo lamp on his drawing table as a graphic rendering model. Lasseter experimented with the model, using it for motion studies. He demonstrated the animated Luxo model at an animation festival in Brussels. Lasseter did not plan on creating a story for the lamp, but the Belgian animator Raoul Servais urged him to write a plot. Servais said that \\"No matter how short it is, it should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Don't forget the story.\\" Servais persuaded Lasseter that the length of the animation would not impede the story, telling him \\"You can tell a story in ten seconds.\\" The inspiration for the Luxo Jr. character came from Lasseter's interactions with Spencer, the young son of Tom Porter, a Pixar team member. Lasseter wondered if the body proportions of a child could be applied to a lamp. Lasseter said that \\"Spencer was about one and a half, and seeing him hold his arms up over his head made me laugh, because he couldn't really touch the top of his head yet. After he left, I started thinking, what would a baby lamp look like?\\" He changed the proportions of the lamp model to make it more infant-like, giving a large head and a small body. Lasseter did not modify the size of the light bulb. He imagined that the store-bought bulb was separate from the \\"body\\" of the lamp and did not age.  Films  =Luxo Jr.= Lasseter followed Servais' advice and conceived the plot for a short film starring Luxo Jr. as the protagonist. The story would have two characters, Luxo Jr. and a bigger lamp named Luxo Sr. Luxo Jr. plays with a small ball, but jumping on it causes it to deflate. Saddened by the loss of the toy, Luxo Jr. hops off screen. Luxo Jr. finds a beach ball and reappears chasing after it, while the parent lamp shakes its head. The film demonstrated advances in the technology of self-shadowing. Lasseter said that \\"The animation of a lamp whose head is a light-source, moving around and self-shadowing the world around him, was a perfect matching of technology and subject matter.\\" Luxo Jr. made its debut at the 1986 SIGGRAPH show in Dallas. The film received critical acclaim for its photorealistic style and emotional impact. =Sesame Street shorts= Luxo Jr. also appeared in four educational short films created by Pixar specially for Sesame Street in 1991: Light & Heavy, Surprise, Up and Down and Front and Back. *Light & Heavy: Luxo Jr. demonstrates both light and heavy by using a beach ball to demonstrate light and later a bowling ball to demonstrate heavy. *Surprise: Luxo Sr. examines a box in which Luxo Jr. pops out, demonstrating surprise. *Up and Down: Luxo Jr. demonstrates up and down by jumping on and off of a cardboard box until he falls through. *Front and Back: Luxo, Jr. demonstrates front and back by showing his front and back until he gets exhausted and falls over. =Toy Story series= In the Toy Story franchise, a red Luxo lamp appears on Andy's desk. Animatronic A 6-ft. high animatronic figure modeled after Luxo Jr. stood near the Toy Story Midway Mania attraction at the Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park. The animatronic often danced to music on a ledge near the entrance. In 2010 Disney removed the animatronic without offering an official explanation, but the Luxo ASA lawsuit may have been a factor. At Disney California Adventure, there is an animatronic of Luxo Jr. on top of the Pixar Pier marquee. Lawsuit Luxo ASA, the Norwegian company that manufactures Luxo lamps, sued Pixar and its parent company Disney in 2009 by claiming that Disney violated its trademarks by selling promotional lamps branded as the Luxo Jr. character. Disney had planned on bundling the Luxo Jr. lamp with the collector's edition of the Up Blu-ray release. Luxo ASA claimed that the Luxo Jr. merchandise would \\"cause devastating damage to Luxo and dilute the goodwill which Luxo has built up.\\" Disney settled with Luxo ASA and agreed not to sell Luxo Jr. lamps while Luxo ASA did not object to \\"artistic renditions\\" of the lamp and allowed Pixar to keep using Luxo Jr. as a character.

Since their father's demise, their families lived in hardship with their mother (Ku Faridah) living in fear caused by threats from loan sharks who came to collect their father's debt. Due to financial problems and hardship,Jai turned aggressive to the point of willing to do anything for money to change his luck,meanwhile gaining the disapproval from his family. On the other end,Malik is getting bogged down thinking about the problems they faced and coupled with the inspection results from the doctor confirming that his mother is suffering from cancer. Meanwhile, Tailong (Rosyam Nor)who himself is among the biggest gangster heads in Kuala Lumpur was actively carrying out illegal activities. All of Tailong's actions was not favoured by the other gangsters, but they had to contend with his power. At the same time, King (Ridzuan Hashim) and his stepson, Shark (Syamsul Yusof) planned to strengthen their position by taking down Tailong and calling for help from his long-time best friend, Malik, and offering huge sums of money to him. Malik accepted the offer in the intention of covering the medical cost for his mother and to pay his father's debt. But his activity was not consented by his mother and both the latter and his brother were driven out of their home. King became increasingly powerful with the help of Malik and his presence made Tailong feel threatened. He plans to eliminate King and Malik. A huge fight later ensued between the two groups when Tailong ambushed King and Malik at a night club. They were almost defeated by Tailong and King was incapacitated, but Malik's fighting skills proved to be a match even for Tailong. Shortly after, the police arrived and they managed to escape. At the same time, Malik spotted a tattoo on Tailong's body similar to the one the murderer of his father had. The conflict and animosity between Malek and Tailong grew from that point onwards. When Tailong discovered that Jai and Malik were brothers, he overpowered Jai and proceeded to kidnap Zati (Sheera Iskandar) and raped her in front of Jai. Malik went home to find his mother suffering severe injuries due to being beaten by Tailong's men. He had no clue as to what his siblings are going through, and he rushed his mother to the hospital. Tailong finally called Malik to the port if he wants to save his siblings in the final showdown. With the help of Ajib,a section head who sees Malik as his blood brother (Soffi Jikan) and his men, Malik managed to take down Tailong's men. Malik and Jai teamed up, succeeding in defeating Tailong and afterwards handed him over to Shark, who shot him dead. They then rushed to the hospital with money taken from Tailong's briefcase to pay the deposit so that their mother can undergo surgery. Although this results in their mother and sister disowning them who sees their involvement in the gang world brought upon ruin to the family, just as their late father did. In the aftermath,Jai stubbornly continues to remain in the criminal world in his quest for riches, and Malek was arrested by the police after being framed by Shark, who planted the evidence in his car. While he was being escorted to the police station, Malek prayed to God for the safety of his family while he was serving time. At the same time, Tailong's death caused a drastic change in the gang hierarchy. Credited for taking down Tailong, Shark quickly rose to prominence and he became the gang leader in KL.

Produced by R. Venkatraman, the film won the Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director at the 30th National Film Awards in 1983. The film was based on Indira Parthasarathy's novel Kuruthipunal which won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1977. It stars newcomer Vijaymohan and Poornima Jayaram in the lead roles, with Jaishankar, Rajesh, N. Viswanathan and Raveendran in pivotal roles. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by Ilaiyaraaja while cinematography was handled by Soumendu Roy. Plot Gautam, a photo journalist with revolutionary ideas, leaves his job after his editor fails to publish the true happenings of the society in their newspaper. One of Gautam's friends suggests him to organize an art exhibition to showcase his paintings. During the event, he happens to meet Arundhati, a Bharathanatyam dancer, who is keen to stage a classical ballet on Nandanar, a tenth century dalit saint. Gautam suggests Arundhati to present it in a folk- art form rather than a classical-art form like Bharathanatyam to which she agrees. Gautam and Arundhati travel to Kilvenmani, a village in Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu, to meet Thambiran, an aged exponent of Theru Koothu, a common folk-art form in Tamil Nadu. Gautam and Arudnhati both stay at the landlord's (Rajarathinam) house. In the village they happen to meet various characters – Vairam, a tea shop owner, his pregnant wife Valli, their daughter Amudha, Kaalai, a blacksmith, Pakkiri, a mad minstrel, and Papathy, a village belle who works as a maid in Rajarathinam's house. Gautam and Arundhati become more attached with these characters. Vairam and Kaalai stand up against Raja demanding higher wages for workers employed by Raja. Gautam and Arundhati happen to meet Thambiran who agrees to help them stage the ballet. An angered Raja tells the police that Vairam's teashop has encroached the temple's land, and orders his henchmen to destroy the shop. Kaalai provides shelter to Vairam and his family. Gautam, on seeing the injustice being done to Vairam, talks to Raja for which the latter advises him not to interfere in this issue. Papathy wishes to be photographed and approaches Gautam for which Raja's henchmen attack him. After this incident, Gautam and Arundhati leave Raja's house and take shelter at Thambiran's house. While researching Nandanar's biography, Gautam gets a new perspective for the story based on the events that take place in the village and develops a story based on Raja's cruel acts. In the meanwhile, Raja's goons abduct Vairam. A group of villagers led by Kaalai gather outside Raja's house. Gautam approaches Papathy to join the protest against Raja and asks her to reveal the whereabouts of Vairam. Kaalai and the villagers rescue Vairam after Papathy lets them know that Vairam is kept at Raja's rice mill. As the villagers protest demanding higher wages, Raja employs workers from nearby villages. When Vairam and Kaalai try to stop the workers, Raja arrives with a group of policemen. Kaalai beats Raja and gets immediately arrested for the act. A lawyer bails out Kaalai and ask them to take police protection to which they refuse. Vairam and Kaalai are attacked by Raja's henchmen while returning to their village during which Kaalai gets killed. With the help of the police, Raja labels Kaalai as a Naxalite to get the case closed. On hearing this, the villagers refuse to cremate Kaalai, but Vairam cremates him outside the village. Meanwhile, Raja files a complaint against Gautam, Arundhati and Vairam on a false pretext that they have stolen his possessions and attacked his mother. Arundhati gets saved by one of the villagers when Raja's goons try to molest her. The goons also set Kaalai's hut on fire, but Pakiri saves Vairam's family. He along with Vairam fight Raja's goons and kill them before being arrested by the police. The whole colony gets burnt. The following day, Raja is seen walking happily on his land. Papathy meets him and at first appears affectionate, but after they hug, she stabs him to death.

Inspired by the novel, Sreedhar Rajan made the film with a revolutionary theme, set in the backdrop of folk-arts. It marked Sreedhar Rajan's directorial debut. Sreedhar Rajan used a fusion of revolutionary communism and folk in the film. The film narrated the tale of Nandanar, a dalit saint and one of the 63 Nayanars. Bharata Natyam dancer V. P. Dhananjayan appeared in a song sequence, thus performing for the first time in a film. The sequence was meant to narrate Nandanar Charitam, the story of the saint.

It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. This species has been introduced to New Zealand and Florida. Description Conopeum seurati is an encrusting bryozoan that forms small colonies on seagrasses, shells and other hard surfaces. When a larva of Conopeum seurati settles on a suitable surface, it undergoes metamorphosis into a zooid known as an ancestrula. This is oval in shape and measures about . The ancestrula buds to produce another zooid which has a pair of long spines at the distal end and sometimes a further three to five pairs of thin spines at the sides. Further asexual reproduction takes place, with each zooid producing several buds until there is a small, roughly circular encrusting cluster of zooids, white or brownish-white in colour, with the ancestrula at the centre. On flat surfaces the colony is regular and lacy in appearance but on uneven surfaces, it is more irregular and may form lobes. Some colonies are also spherical. Each individual zooid bears a lophophore, the characteristic feeding apparatus of bryozoans, with fifteen or sixteen ciliated tentacles, used to filter phytoplankton. The operculum, a flap that hinges to form a lid over the aperture of the lophophore, has a membranous edge and is chitinised. It is thick and crescent-shaped when closed. The walls between the zooids are calcified on the proximal edge and membranous elsewhere. Distribution and habitat Conopeum seurati full distribution is unknown. It is found on the coasts of northern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. It is considered to have been introduced to the Atlantic coast of Florida and to New Zealand. It is a fouling species and is found in brackish water, estuaries and lagoons where it can tolerate a wide range of salinities; these range from eighteen to forty parts per thousand in the Indian River Lagoon, and as little as one ppt. in Europe. It usually forms colonies on seagrasses, ditch grasses, floating seaweed, mussels, oysters and man-made structures. Biology Like other bryozoans, Conopeum seurati is a suspension feeder, filtering phytoplankton from the water with its tentacles. Breeding takes place between June and October in Britain. The cyphonautes larvae are triangular in shape with brownish bivalve shells in their later developmental stages. These larvae are planktonic and drift with the currents for some time before settling and undergoing metamorphosis into ancestrulae to found new colonies.

He was the author of over 30 novels and hundreds of short stories. At one time, Bennett was one of the most popular authors in America. Several of his books reportedly sold over 100,000 copies. Bennett's work frequently appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, The New York Ledger and other periodicals. Some of his writings were translated into other languages. Bennett also wrote poetry and edited several periodicals. However these other literary endeavors never met with the commercial success of his prose fiction. Bennett wrote light, sensational and heroic adventure tales which many readers found engaging. His work sometimes first appeared in serialized form in newspapers and periodicals, which were subsequently reissued in book form. Despite selling well at times, Bennett's fiction is generally regarded as substantially lacking in literary merit. He is more remembered as one of the leading novelists of the “yaller kivers” period of mid-nineteenth century American fiction, (so called for the “yellow covers” on the cheap sensational novels sold in railway stations and by newsboys during that era.) His books have also been called \\"dime novels\\". Bennett's popularity declined significantly during his later life. Bennett was born in Monson, Massachusetts on May 16, 1822 and attended local schools and Monson Academy. At 17, he left home with the intention of becoming a writer. Little is known about this period of Bennett's life. It is known that after leaving home he moved initially to New York City, and then later to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Pittsburgh, eventually relocating to Cincinnati in 1844. During this period he lived frugally and supported himself in several sales jobs. Unable to gain steady employment as a writer, he took work going on the road throughout Ohio selling subscriptions for the Western Literary Journal. Returning from one of these sales trips, Bennett learned that a story he had written while in Philadelphia had been published. On the strength of this first successful story, Bennett was able to obtain a commission to write a serialized story for the Western Literary Journal. Many more publications of Bennett's work followed. Bennett also edited several periodical publications during his career. In 1847 Bennett married Eliza G. Daly. In 1850, he returned to Philadelphia, where he eventually retired. He spent the last few years of his life as a resident of the Masonic Home in that city, until his death in 1905 at the age of 82. Although not altogether without artistic merit, Bennett's fiction has been characterized as derivative and formulaic, lacking originality. His work was also at times overtly racist or antisemitic. Today Bennett is remembered primarily as a figure of historical interest for the depictions he rendered of life on the American frontier. Bennett at times incorporated actual historical persons and events into his fictionalized stories. Bennett himself is considered a noteworthy figure in the early history of American popular fiction.

After retiring from cycling in 2002, Bouchard-Hall pursued a career in business, including positions as a management consultant at McKinsey and as a Director at international cycling retailer, Wiggle.com. From 2015-2019, he served as the CEO and President of USA Cycling.https://www.usacycling.org/bouchard-hall-named-usa-cycling-chief- executive-officer.htm/ref>. He currently serves as the CEO of Assos of Switzerland. https://www.assos.com/}>  Biography  Cycling and Education Derek Albert Bouchard-Hall was born at the naval base in Port Hueneme, CA, where his naval officer father was based. He spent most of his childhood in Norton, MA, where he graduated from Norton High School in 1988. Though a successful runner in high school, a foot injury led Bouchard-Hall to pursue cycling at Princeton University. Bouchard-Hall graduated from Princeton in 1992, with a degree in Architectural Engineering, then moved to the West Coast to attend Stanford University. Bouchard-Hall graduated from Stanford in 1994 with an MS in Structural Engineering and began his professional cycling career, signing with Team Shaklee. Shaklee teammates introduced Bouchard-Hall to track cycling, and he soon began to train with the US track cycling team. From 1996–2000, Bouchard-Hall divided his cycling calendar into training and competing for both his professional road cycling team and for the US National track cycling team. In 1998, Bouchard-Hall moved from Team Shaklee to the newly formed Mercury Cycling Team, where he competed both domestically and internationally. It was as a member of the Mercury team where Bouchard-Hall achieved his greatest road successes, winning the United States National Criterium Championships in 2000 and competing in Paris–Roubaix, Gent–Wevelgem, and Critérium International. In 1999, Bouchard-Hall was a member of the gold medal winning team pursuit squad at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada. In 2000, Bouchard-Hall achieved another career highlight when he was selected as a member of the US Olympic team, to compete in the track cycling team pursuit event, after winning the US National Championship in the team pursuit with Erin Hartwell, Mariano Friedick, and Tommy Mulkey. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Bouchard-Hall and the US team pursuit team finished in 10th place. Bouchard-Hall continued to cycle for Mercury until the 2002 cycling season, when he announced his retirement at the age of 32 during the US Road Championships in Philadelphia, PA., in June. At the time, Mercury was ranked #1 in the NRC team standings. Exterior and Common Iliac Endofibrosis Toward the end of his cycling career, Bouchard-Hall began experiencing pain and loss of strength in his left leg when he was training. After months of various medical and physio examinations, and through his own extensive research, he sought the advice of a vascular surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. Bouchard-Hall underwent surgery at Stanford University Medical Center to correct the problem in the winter of 2000, which ultimately led to his most successful year as a professional cyclist. In 2002, however, the pain and numbness in his leg returned, and, rather than risking a second highly invasive surgery, he retired. Post-Cycling Career From 2002–2004, Bouchard- Hall attended Harvard Business School, graduating with an MBA in 2004, and began working in management consulting, first in Boston and then, in 2006, for McKinsey and Company in London. In 2009–2010, he served as interim director of the US Small Business Administration's HUBZone program, in Washington, DC, before returning to London in the summer of 2010. Since October 2011, Bouchard-Hall has been an executive with Wiggle Ltd, one of the world's largest internet retailers of cycling, running, and triathlon equipment. Bouchard-Hall succeeded Steve Johnson as President and CEO of USA Cycling in June 2015. Personal Bouchard-Hall is married with two children and resides in Colorado Springs, CO.

Background On March 18, 1976, former undisputed heavyweight champions George Foreman and Joe Frazier agreed to face one another in a rematch of their 1973 heavyweight title bout.Foreman, Frazier Sign for Rematch, Sarasota Herald-Tribune article, Retrieved on 2014-04-02 In their previous encounter, Foreman had brutalized the then-champion Frazier, scoring six knockdowns in less than two rounds to capture the WBA and WBC heavyweight championships. Foreman had then successfully defended the titles twice, easily defeating José Roman and Ken Norton by knockout in the first and second rounds respectively. Foreman, however, lost his titles to Muhammad Ali in \\"The Rumble in the Jungle\\" in October 1974, by KO in the eighth round. The following year, Frazier finally got his first chance to regain the heavyweight titles, challenging Ali in a fight dubbed the \\"Thrilla in Manila\\", though he lost by technical knockout in the 14th round. After his defeat at the hands of Ali, Foreman was out of boxing for over a year, sitting out all of 1975. He returned in January 1976 to defeat Ron Lyle and capture the less-regarded NABF heavyweight title before agreeing to face Frazier. Foreman hoped a victory over Frazier would propel him to a championship rematch with Ali, while Frazier, who was close to retirement, hoped to avenge the blowout loss Foreman had bestowed him with three years prior. The Fight At the start of the fight, Frazier abandoned his usual aggressive approach and utilized a more defensive style to avoid a repeat of his previous fight with Foreman. Frazier kept his distance throughout the first four rounds and even taunted Foreman by dropping his hands and daring him to land a punch. Foreman, however, took control of the action, getting Frazier against the ropes and weakening him with powerful body shots. In the fifth, Foreman finally broke through and landed a combination with Frazier against the ropes with the final punch being a devastating left hook that sent a bloodied Frazier to the canvas. Frazier got back up and continued the fight, but Foreman quickly sent him back down with a powerful right hand. Frazier pulled himself back up at the count of seven, but his trainer Eddie Futch jumped on the ring apron and ordered the referee to stop the fight to prevent further punishment. Foreman was then named the winner by technical knockout at 2:26 of the fifth round.Smokin' Joe Burns Out, Sports Illustrated article, 1976-06-28, Retrieved on 2014-04-04 References Category:1976 in boxing Category:Boxing matches Category:June 1976 sports events Category:1976 in sports in New York (state) ","title":"George Foreman vs. Joe Frazier II"},{"id":"42410858","text":"\\"A Farmer's Ghost\\" is a popular English poem by the Indian poet and writer Anju Makhija.

Biography =Early life and career= He was born the illegitimate son of George Pigot, 1st Baron Pigot (1719–1777), and Catherine Hill, and was thus a nephew of Lieutenant-General Robert Pigot and Admiral Hugh Pigot, and a cousin of General Henry Pigot and the notorious Captain Hugh Pigot. His brothers Richard and George both had distinguished careers in the army, rising to the rank of general and major respectively. Pigot entered the Navy on 1 May 1788, first serving aboard the 50-gun fourth-rate ship , under the command of Captain Erasmus Gower, and the flagship of Rear-Admiral John Elliot, Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland. Later in the year he moved into the sloop , Captain Edward Pakenham. He then served for three years in home waters under Captain Andrew Snape Douglas, as a midshipman in the frigate , and in the guard ships and . In 1792 he sailed for the Mediterranean aboard the 50-gun , flagship of Rear-Admiral Samuel Granston Goodall, who he followed into the 98-gun ship in May 1793.O'Byrne (1849), pp. 905–906 Following the evacuation of Toulon in December 1793, he was appointed acting-lieutenant of the 74-gun , Captain Andrew Sutherland (mariner), then served for a short period as midshipman in the Princess Royal, and in the 100-gun , flagship of Admiral William Hotham. He was officially promoted to lieutenant on 12 November 1794 to serve aboard the sloop , under the Captains the Honourable Henry Hotham, Shuldham Peard, and Edwards. His next appointments were to the , Captain John Pakenham; the frigate , under Captains Ralph Willett Miller and Edward Hamilton; the 74-gun , flagship of Vice Admiral Sir Richard Onslow; and the , Captain John William Spranger. In those ships he served in the Mediterranean, Newfoundland, the North Sea, Baltic, and Jamaica stations. Promoted to commander on 29 April 1802, Pigot commanded the brig-sloop off Seaford from 24 August 1803, until promoted to post-captain on 8 May 1804. =Post-captain= On 27 March 1805 Pigot commissioned the sloop at Sheerness, but remained in her only for three months. He commanded the sixth rate , and then from 28 June 1806 the 32-gun fifth-rate , both in the West Indies. On 5 April 1807 Circe captured the French privateer Austerlitz of 18 guns and 125 men.

He commanded the 74-gun and then the frigate , on the same station, and commanded the blockading squadron off Guadeloupe at the start of 1809 in the latter ship. On 10 February 1809, Latona assisted in the capture of French frigate Junon, of 46 guns and 323 men, whose fire wounded six of Latonas crew. The exertions and activity Pigot displayed in erecting jury-masts, and putting the prize into a seaworthy state, gained him the warm official thanks of the senior officer present, Captain George Scott, of the Horatio. On 17 April 1809 Pigot witnessed (and was much praised for his spirited exertions during the chase which preceded) the surrender of the French 74-gun ship ; and on 18 June in the same year took part in the capture of the , pierced for 42 guns, but having only 14 of her main-deck armament mounted, with a complement of 174 men, and a cargo of sugar, coffee, etc. Pigot then moved into the frigate , in which he spent the next four years stationed in the West Indies and at Halifax.

Serving HMNB Portland at Portland Harbour, the hospital is located close to Castletown. Discounting earlier, temporary incarnations of the hospital, the permanent naval hospital was built at the beginning of the 20th century. It closed in 1957, when it was handed over to the National Health Service, which still runs the hospital as NHS Portland Community Hospital. History The hospital seen from the Merchant's Railway incline. Before the main hospital was constructed, an early incarnation was established in the naval dockyard, while the Portland Royal Navy's Sick Quarters and Zymotic Hospital (Infectious Diseases branch) was located at Castle Road, near the incline of the Merchant's Railway. Around the turn of the century, a permanent general hospital at Castle Road was established. Completed by 1906, the original site was made up of an officers' block, administration block, surgical block and medical block. An un-timetabled station, Portland Hospital Halt, provided railway access to the site. During World War II, an underground operating theatre was constructed. Along with the surgical block, it was the only section of the hospital to be in full-time operation. After suffering bomb damage in 1940, a decision was made for as many patients as possible to be moved to a less vulnerable site. Minterne House, located at Minterne Magna in Dorchester, was requisitioned for this purpose, leaving Portland's hospital to become a casualty and emergency hospital only. Despite this, it would receive 5,222 inpatients over the course of the war. The hospital became surplus to requirements and was handed over to the National Health Service in 1957. The underground operating theatre, although rewired during 1954-5, was then stripped of much of its equipment. In 1996, the Portland Rotary were successful in gaining access to the theatre for a weekend of public tours.

The property features a landscape of tall cedars, as well as old English boxwoods and traces of an original rose garden like at John Blocker's father's home, the Blocker House. The gardens at Cedar Grove were reputedly laid out by Andre Michaux, the renowned botanist who had designed the gardens at Middleton Place in Charleston, South Carolina. The famous English boxwoods of Cedar Grove were sold during the Great Depression to the Rockefeller family and placed in the gardens of the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg, Virginia. Also on the property are the contributing servant's quarters and original kitchen. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

During his studies in Medicine at the University of Vienna, he met Dr Karl König and became part of a youth group whose members formed the core of what was to become Camphill in Scotland. Being of Jewish origin, he fled Austria together with his first wife, Helene Stoll, completed his doctor's degree in Basel, after which, at the outbreak of World War II he joined Dr König and the others in Scotland. Near Aberdeen, on Camphill estate, they founded the work in curative education for those they called \\"children in need of special care,\\" which was to occupy him for the rest of his life. He had a number of children with Helene, one of whom, Christine Polyblank, founded the Ringwood Waldorf School. As Camphill grew, so his responsibilities increased, ranging from farming and general handyman to doctor, educator, lecturer and writer. In 1957 he was appointed Superintendent of the Camphill work by Dr König. He had, by this time, also established a thriving practice as a doctor, including working at Dr. König's own London practice. At the same time he travelled widely, lecturing at Camphill centres throughout the world as well as to the general public. It was in this manner that he met BBC film director Jonathan Stedall, then 28 and taking a year off to study at Emerson College. Their collaboration led to the numerous films for British television that Stedall made on Camphill such as \\"Candle on the Hill\\". Weihs’ best-known work, the book Children in Need of Special Care, was published in 1971 and has since been reprinted on several occasions and translated into 14 languages. His final work, \\"Embryogenesis in Myth and Science\\", was completed on his deathbed and published posthumously. Besides this, his work as sculptor led to a considerable number of pieces set up all over the various farms and public buildings of Camphill.

Although the original image of the bro lifestyle is associated with sports apparel and fraternities, it lacks a consistent definition. Most aspects vary regionally such as in California where it overlaps with surf culture. Oxford Dictionaries have noted that bros frequently self-identify with neologisms containing the word \\"bro\\" as a prefix or suffix. Etymology and history Bro was originally an abbreviated form of the word brother but began to assume non-familial connotations in the 20th century. In this evolution, it was first used to refer to another man, such as a \\"guy\\" or \\"fellow\\". In these ways, it was semantically similar to the use of \\"brother\\". In the 1970s, bro came to refer to a male friend rather than just another friend. The word became associated with young men who spend time partying with others like themselves. Oxford Dictionaries identified the use of the term \\"bro\\" as the one \\"defining feature\\" of the changing cultural attributes of young manhood. The applications of bro subculture correlate with black people that include the word. The word is used as a modifier for compound terms such as \\"brogrammer\\" and \\"curlbro\\". The word brah is used similarly, and is sometimes combined as \\"bro-brahs\\", other variations exist such as: bruh or breh. Oxford Dictionaries wrote that the term \\"lends itself\\" to compounding and blending, with combinations such as \\"bro-hug\\" and \\"bro- step\\" and portmanteaux such as \\"bro-down\\", \\"bromance\\", and \\"brohemian\\". This creation of neologisms was called \\"portmanbros\\" by 2009. Oxford Dictionaries compared this trend to man- prefixes (e.g., man cave, mansplaining, manscaping) but noted that the bro portmanteaux subset refers to a smaller portion of masculinity. Oxford Dictionaries also noted that many of the terms were \\"stunt coinages\\" with little hope of widespread adoption. However, the term \\"bromance\\", whose first usage was recorded in a 2001 issue of TransWorld Surf, entered the Oxford English Dictionary. The term \\"bro-hug\\" was used at least eight times in The New York Times between 2010 and 2013 and \\"brogrammer\\" once became the center of Silicon Valley gender conversations. In comparison to the \\"hipster\\" modifier, Oxford Dictionaries called the \\"bro\\" modifier more playful, and responsible for making the subculture \\"ripe for (often self- inflicted) mockery\\".  Characteristics Fraternity brothers are commonly associated with bro subculture Oxford Dictionaries identify bros metonymously as those who themselves use the word to refer to others, such as in the example of \\"don't tase me, bro\\", in which the taserer is not a bro, but the tased is. The subculture is not defined consistently or concretely, but refers to a type of \\"fratty masculinity\\", predominantly \\"if not exclusively\\" white, associated with frayed-brim baseball hats, oxford shirts, sports team T-shirts, cargo shorts, and boat shoes or sandals. NPR also noted that bros could include people of color and women, though that is not the popular conception of bro subculture. Oxford Dictionaries recognized Barney Stinson's character on the sitcom How I Met Your Mother as \\"the quintessence of a certain iteration of the contemporary bro\\" and noted how his language uses the word liberally. A survey from NPR's Codeswitch blog named popular figures such as Matthew McConaughey, Brody Jenner, Joe Rogan, Dane Cook, and John Mayer as representative of bro subculture, with Ryan Lochte as their \\"platonic ideal of bro-dom\\". Ryan Lochte has been named as the \\"platonic ideal of bro-dom\\" The wide-ranging iterations of bro include \\"twenty-something investment bankers\\", fraternity brothers in flannel shirts, and \\"laconic surfers\\". NPR identified four types of bros: dudely, jockish, preppy, and stoner-ish. In their description, dudely bros form close and homosocial friendships in a group of bros, jockish bros are defined by ability at team sports tempered by interest in alcohol, preppy bros wear \\"conservatively casual\\" clothes such as Abercrombie and Fitch (and are the sons of Brooks Brothers-wearing men) and flaunt \\"social privilege\\", and stoner-ish bros may not get high but speak relaxedly and exude the air of surfers.  Use as a pejorative  In a New York Magazine article in September 2013, Ann Friedman wrote: \\"Bro once meant something specific: a self-absorbed young white guy in board shorts with a taste for cheap beer. But it’s become a shorthand for the sort of privileged ignorance that thrives in groups dominated by wealthy, white, straight men.\\"How Do You Change a Bro-Dominated Culture? Ann Friedman, New York Magazine, September 12, 2013 The term bro culture has been adopted by the media to refer to a misogynist culture within an organization or community, such as occupational inequality in Silicon Valley. =Lacrosse bro (Lax Bro)= Lax bro subculture is defined as a laid-back (\\"chill\\") lifestyle associated with lacrosse. The bounds of the subculture are loose, but its character traits include \\"understated confidence that critics call arrogance\\", long hair (known as \\"lettuce\\"), colorful board shorts, flat-brim baseball hats, and colorful half-calf socks. The bands O.A.R., Dispatch, and Dave Matthews Band are associated with lax bros. Typical lax bro \\"attitude and style\\" are common in middle schools and universities according to a 2012 report in The Boston Globe. Enthusiasts praise the subculture's \\"sense of identity\\" and popularization of a sport indigenous to the United States, while detractors take issue with the \\"preppie/frat boy image that glories elitism and wealth, and values flash over hard work\\". The gay community has coined the term \\"gaybro\\".The Reddit group of macho gay boys Slate.com 2013/03 In 2013, former Microsoft game designer Daniel Cook wrote that the company was responsible for developing the bro subculture within video gaming, explaining that the \\"Xbox put machismo, ultra-violence and chimpboys with backwards caps in the spotlight. [...] Gamers were handed a pre-packaged group identity via the propaganda machine of a mega corporation.\\" Cook writes that Microsoft has done this in order to distance the Xbox from its console competitors, which were portrayed as \\"kids platform[s]\\".

The organisation was founded under the leadership of Ratibhai Ukabhai, a modest social worker and an erstwhile Indian National Congress member. It had strong support amongst the Leua Patidar community. Initially the Khedut Sangh was intended to function as a general farmers' body within the Indian National Congress framework. But the organisation failed to obtain support from the Congress leadership and developed into a separate movement. The Socialist Party leader Jaswant Mehta was amongst the supporters of the Khedut Sangh. In its initial phase the group had a more leftist outlook. It accused the Congress Party of pro-urban and pro-Girasdar (landlord) bias, that the party neglected rural and tenants' interests. The Khedut Sangh opposed the mandatory food levy on the peasantry. Once the Girasdari system of land tenancy was abolished, the Khedut Sangh moved to a more rightist outlook and the socialists deserted the organisation. The organisation entered into an electoral alliance with Samaldas Gandhi's Praja Paksha. Nevertheless, the Saurashtra Khedut Sangh maintained more leftist postures than the Gujarat Khedut Sangh (which focused more on landowners' rights than the right of tillers to the land). In the run-up to the 1951 elections the Saurashtra Khedut Sangh was the main contender against the Congress Party in the state. It had some 42,000 paying members. But it lacked prominent leaders.

Dyer and his hoaxes have appeared in Time, Discovery News, Fox News Channel, The Huffington Post and CNN. 2008 Hoax On August 12, 2008, Matthew Whitton and Dyer released a press release and went on Steve Kulls' radio show Squatch Detective to announce they had a dead Bigfoot body in their possession. After initially leaking grainy footage that showed Bigfoot, they presented the carcass encased in a block of ice at a conference that was only open to the press. The two announced that they found the 7-foot-7-inch, 500-lbs creature while hiking in the north Georgia mountains in June. They also stated that they had spotted about three other similar creatures after making the discovery. According to Dyer, it took them a day and a half with six men to carry out the Bigfoot, all the while being followed by other Bigfoot creatures.

Upon being exposed, Dyer said that an unnamed government agency confiscated the real Bigfoot body, and, believing that he needed to produce something, fabricated the hoax. 2012 Hoax In 2012, Dyer claimed to have killed a Bigfoot-like creature in San Antonio, Texas, in early September. According to Dyer, he lured the Bigfoot out using \\"pork ribs from Wal-Mart\\" doused in a special barbecue sauce that he attached to trees. Of the experience, he told Esquire magazine, \\"We nailed 'em all around the trees, and then that night we heard Bigfoot come back. I chased him down in the middle of the night. I shot him once, he ran, I shot him again.\\" He claimed that an unnamed university in Washington state had tested the creature's DNA and told Dyer that it was an unknown species. Dyer's accomplice and self-proclaimed bigfoot skeptic, Allen Issleb (\\"Musky Allen\\") of Wauconda, Illinois, claimed to have inspected Dyer's bigfoot in Las Vegas in February 2013 and proclaimed it to be the real thing. This claim resulted in many people getting sucked into Dyer's scam. Dyer called the creature Hank and started touring the body around the United States, charging people to view it. To view the body, which lay beneath Plexiglas in a wooden coffin, adults were charged $10 and children were charged $5. The sold-out tour eventually pulled in close to $500,000. Of the creature, Dyer stated \\"DNA, DNA sequencing, scans, autopsy, everything you can imagine it was being done.\\" Some in the media endorsed Dyer, including Andrew Clacy. Critics soon pointed out that Dyer had pulled off a Bigfoot hoax in 2008, and called for Dyer to release more open testing. Throughout the course of the hoax, Dyer repeatedly slandered anyone who openly spoke up about him. Many suggested this tactic was just more proof that Dyer was hoaxing again. Professor Don Jeffrey Meldrum at the Department of Anthropology at Idaho State University stated \\"The thing has clearly been fabricated to depict a specimen that has been dissected. It smacks of images of alien autopsy.\\" Responding to the controversy, team members working with Dyer on the touring and Bigfoot projects overall confronted Dyer. Andrew Clacy, a spokesperson for the project, wrote \\"I confronted Mr. Dyer in Daytona on my suspicions of authenticity, and he admitted to me personally that the body of 'Hank' was not a real body, but rather a construct of a company from Washington State which was paid for by Rick Dyer. I am available and willing to cooperate with any Federal or State law enforcement investigations should they arise.\\" Clacy immediately flew back to Australia and abandoned both the project and Dyer. With his crew leaving, Dyer announced on his Facebook page that Hank was indeed a fake. Chris Russell of Twisted Toy Box in Washington admitted he had manufactured Hank at Dyer's request, using latex, foam and camel hair. Dyer had told Russell the prop was for a movie about killing Bigfoot that he was shooting and that he also wanted a baby Bigfoot and female to be created. Russell started receiving threatening phone calls, emails and other contact for making the prop and so decided against making the rest of the Bigfoot family. Russell stated \\"I was asked to make the prop look like a poorly made, old and rotten taxidermy prop that had not been preserved correctly. Dyer did send photos and drawings taken from the Internet and asked for certain features to be replicated.\\" Dyer maintains that he actually does have the body of a real Bigfoot that he shot and killed, but cannot produce it. Aftermath On his Facebook page, Dyer posted \\"From this moment on, I will speak the truth! No more lies, tall tales or wild goose chases to mess with the haters. I never treated anyone bad, I'm a joker, I play around, that's just me. Coming clean about everything is necessary for a new start. From this moment own I will speak the truth! No more lies, tall tales or wild goose chases to mess with the haters!\\" in March, 2014. Benjamin Radford, deputy editor of skeptic magazine Skeptical Inquirer, stated \\"If Bigfoot researchers wish to be taken seriously, they could start by cleaning their own house. The biggest threat to their credibility is not skeptics nor a ridiculing public but instead those who provide an endless stream of bogus claims and evidence.\\" References Category:Bigfoot Category:Hoaxes in the United States Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Rick Dyer (Bigfoot)"},{"id":"42411333","text":"The Lafayette County Courthouse is located in Oxford, Mississippi and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

She had an M.S. in mathematics and had been teaching at Virginia State University before starting to work at the Langley Research Center in 1967. She earned a PhD in engineering at George Washington University in 1983 and has published numerous articles in her field. She was the first African- American woman at NASA's Langley Research Center to be promoted into the Senior Executive Service, the top rank in the federal civil service. Darden is one of the researchers featured in the book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race (2016), a history of some of the influential African-American women mathematicians and engineers at NASA in the mid-20th century, by Margot Lee Shetterly. In 2019, Darden was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Early life and career Christine Mann was born September 10, 1942 to schoolteacher Desma l. Cheney and insurance agent Noah Horace Mann Sr. in Monroe, North Carolina. Both parents encouraged her to pursue a quality education. Starting from age three, Darden was brought by her mother to her own classroom where she taught, and at age four, Darden was enrolled in kindergarten. During elementary school, Darden took a great interest in breaking apart and reconstructing mechanical objects like her bicycle. Darden finished her last two years of primary school at Allen High School, a boarding school in Asheville, North Carolina. She graduated as the class valedictorian in 1958, subsequently receiving a scholarship to attend Hampton University, a historically black college then known as Hampton Institute. During her studies at Hampton, she participated in some of the early protests of the Civil Rights Movement. She participated in several student sit-ins alongside her other Black peers. Mann graduated from Hampton with a B.S. in Mathematics in 1962. She also earned a teaching certification, and taught high school mathematics for a brief time. In 1963, Mann married Walter L. Darden Jr., a middle-school science teacher. In 1965 she became a research assistant at Virginia State College, studying aerosol physics. At Virginia State, Darden earned an M.S. in 1967 and taught mathematics there. That same year she was hired by NASA as a data analyst at Langley Research Center. Darden started in the \\"computer pool\\", performing calculations as a computer for engineers. She began automating the process by writing computer programs. After moving into more aeronautical research, in 1973 Darden was promoted to a position as aerospace engineer by her superior John V. Becker. She had nearly been fired earlier. Her early findings in the 1960s and 1970s resulted in a revolution of aerodynamics design to produce low-boom sonic effects. In 1983 Darden earned a Ph.D in engineering from George Washington University. In 1989, Darden was appointed as leader of the Sonic Boom Team, a subsidiary of the High Speed Research (HSR) Program. On the Sonic Boom Team she worked on designs to decrease the negative effects of sonic booms, such as noise pollution and the depletion of the ozone layer. Her team tested new wing and nose designs for supersonic aircraft. She also designed a computer program to simulate sonic booms. The program was cancelled by the government in February 1998, \\"without fan fare or press announcement.\\" A 1998 abstract published by Darden describes the program as focused on \\"technologies needed for the development of an environmentally friendly, economically viable High-Speed Civil Transport [HSCT].\\" Darden wrote more than 50 articles in the general field of aeronautical design, specializing in supersonic flow and flap design, as well as the prediction and minimization of sonic booms.  NASA's \\"Human Computers\\"  In 1935, the first African-American women mathematicians were hired as human computers at NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), then known as NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics). Since many men were overseas fighting in World War II, more job opportunities were given to both white and African-American women. The latter computer pool became known as the \\"West Area Computers\\", in reference to their segregated office. The human computers performed calculations to support research into plane flight and, later, rockets. Because the state of Virginia, where the Langley Research Center was located, had racial segregation, Jim Crow laws were followed at the facility, which is located near Hampton. This changed after the 1964 Civil Rights Act which banned segregation. The collective, once tasked with processing scores of collected flight test data, by the 1940s had garnered a reputation as \\"human computers\\" who were essential to NASA's operation. During the 1950s and 1960s, more of these women gained opportunities to advance as technicians and engineers. Darden started working in the computer pool in 1967 at NASA, after she had completed an M.S. in mathematics at Virginia State University and taught there. By that time, computers were increasingly used for the complex calculations to support engineering and design. Darden left the computer pool in 1989 for a position as engineer, working on decreasing sonic boom in supersonic flight. She earned her PhD in 1983 (with the support of NASA), and became known for her research as \\"one of NASA's preeminent experts on supersonic flight and sonic booms.\\" Darden was promoted as a manager, and she advanced to become the first African-American woman at Langley to be promoted into the Senior Executive Service, the top rank in the federal civil service. In March 2007, Darden retired from NASA as director of the Office of Strategic Communication and Education. Awards In 1985 Darden received the Dr. A. T. Weathers Technical Achievement Award from the National Technical Association. She received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1987. She received three Certificates of Outstanding Performance from Langley Research Center: in 1989, 1991, and 1992. On January 28, 2018, Darden received the Presidential Citizenship Award at Hampton University in recognition for her contribution and service \\". Darden received an honorary degree from North Carolina State University on December 19, 2018. Darden has also received an honorary degree from the George Washington University on May 19, 2019.

Infrastructure and facilities The five deep-water berths are equipped with shore-side power capacity for vessels to plug in. The system was installed to comply with a California Air Resources Board rule requiring land-based power systems to reduce pollution coming from ships by shutting down diesel engines in order to prevent the emission of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter into the air. Two tugboats accompany ships in and out of the harbor and guide them to and from their berths. The port acquired two battery-powered terminal tractors in 2020 to move containers of fresh produce around the port. The American-made Kalmar trucks, funded with grant from the Air Resources Board, and a new tug, that came to the port in 2020, will further reduce emissions from port operations. Three auto processors are located less than from the port. The new vehicles are inspect and accessories installed before they are delivered to dealers in the western United States. While importing automobiles has long been a staple of the port, exporting them internationally began in 1996. This resulted from foreign automakers starting to build factories on U.S. soil in the early 1980s and domestic manufacturers seeking expansion in the international market.Hoops, Stephanie (December 22, 2012) \\"Vehicle exports expected to rise at Port of Hueneme\\" Ventura County Star The import and export of automobiles uses both the rail line and the easy access by truck to the nationwide freight network. =Land transportation network= The Oxnard Harbor District acquired the Ventura County Railway Company LLC, a short line railroad, in 2003. Ventura County Railroad operates the lines which connect the port, the military base, and other facilities in south Oxnard with the Union Pacific Coast route near the Oxnard Transit Center in downtown Oxnard. The port would also benefit if the rail corridor from the Port of Hueneme through the Highway 126 corridor to Santa Clarita was reestablished to carry Central Valley and Santa Clara River Valley citrus and other products to the port and on to foreign markets. The Hueneme Road/Rice Avenue intermodal corridor was established by the district along with the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, the County of Ventura, and approved by the state transportation commission in 1998 to deal with the truck traffic. This direct route connects the port to the nationwide freight network and raises the status of the port to give it access to more federal funding resulting in a competitive advantage. Funding was put in place in 2000 to improve the dedicated freight corridor by extending Rice Road southerly to connect Hueneme Road (Port Hueneme Road within Port Hueneme city limits) and totally rebuilding the interchange for State Route 1 at Pleasant Valley Road. The new interchange at Highway 101 and Rice Avenue was dedicated in 2014 after being improved and expanded from a two-lane overpass with narrow freeway ramps that required sharp difficult turns for trucks. The interchange and road improvements also made Rice Avenue, rather than Oxnard Boulevard, the main thoroughfare between the Ventura Freeway and the Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1). An overpass has been planned for almost two decades along this route at the Rice Avenue intersection with Fifth Street (State Route 34). In February 2015, a Metrolink passenger train collided with a truck at this on-grade crossing. Funding is being allocated for design with a desire by local officials to eventually get the estimated $35 million need for this grade separation project. =Historic sites= Three historic sites are highlighted at viewing points on the Promenade: the 1872 Wharf, the Oxnard Packing House, and extant Point Hueneme Light. The Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board designated the \\"Original Hueneme Wharf Site\\" as County Landmark #24 in 1972.  District governance  The Oxnard Harbor District is an independent special district formed in 1937. The harbor district is governed by a five-member commission elected at-large to staggered four year terms by the voters within the district boundary. The port is one of the five of the deep water ports governed by special districts in the state of California. The state's other six deep water ports are a function of the city in which the port is located. The District boundary includes the City of Port Hueneme, most of the City of Oxnard, and the unincorporated communities of El Rio, Nyeland Acres, Silver Strand, Hollywood Beach and Hollywood by the Sea. The district formed using the existing boundary of the Oxnard Union High School District which also encompassed Camarillo, a portion of Thousand Oaks and additional unincorporated areas of the county. At the time, this seemed like the best arrangement to provide a bond measure that would provide for construction of the port. Dissatisfaction with the boundary grew over the years and the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) recommended in 1972 and 1985 that the boundaries be changed to encompass the entire county.Watson, Carol (January 18, 1990) \\"More Cities Enter Fray Over Port of Hueneme\\" Los Angeles Times Oxnard and Port Hueneme officials requested that the boundaries be dramatically reduced in 1989 after a report showed that these two cities experienced a high percentage of the economic benefits of the port and suffered from heavy truck traffic on city streets, noise and congestion. LAFCO approved and changed the boundary to the current configuration in January, 1991. The commissioners must live within the district and LAFCO agreed with the cities that the boundary should match the area that is most influenced by actions taken by the port.Murphy, Barbara (June 03, 1993) \\"District's New Boundaries Are Upheld\\" Los Angeles Times In 1983, the district and the City of Port Hueneme developed an agreement that provided a payment to the city of 3.33 percent of the port's gross revenues for improvements and services. The agreement recognized that city roads need maintenance due to the port truck traffic and provided for improvements such as road widening. After 9/11, security was increased and the entrance to the port was moved to another street. Some improvements were no longer needed and the port no longer used additional police services from the city. By 2009, the city and port officials were at odds over the need to renegotiate the agreement. The disagreement became particularly heated as the port resolved in 2013 to stop paying a percentage of gross revenues and to only pay for the actual costs of road repair. They also accused the city of using the funds for other municipal purposes.Hoops, Stephanie (June 24, 2014) \\"Port considers cut in funding the city of Port Hueneme\\" Ventura County Star While claiming it was unrelated to the dispute, the city council put a new tax before voters in the November 2014 election that reworks the city’s business tax code to collect more money from maritime businesses at the Port and from the military contractors at Naval Base Ventura County.Hoops, Stephanie (August 6, 2014) \\"Port of Hueneme to oppose proposed city taxes\\" Ventura County StarHoops, Stephanie (September 14, 2014) \\"Effects of Port Hueneme's Measure M unclear\\" Ventura County Star Voters rejected the measure and elected two new city council members who were on good terms with harbor district leaders.Hoops, Stephanie (November 5, 2014) \\"Optimism reigns in wake of Measure M defeat\\" Ventura County Star Community impacts and events Much of the car storage is off-site in south Oxnard where several vehicle processing centers are located. Imported cars are frequently driven out of the port on public streets to these facilities. A volunteer group has special permission to feed feral cats that take care of rats at the port. The group manages the cat population to keep it at about 250 and feeds them three times a week at different locations around the port property. Once a month, volunteers trap cats that are new to the colony, take them to a spay and neuter clinic to be sterilized, given shots to prevent feline diseases, and get their right ears clipped so they can be identified. The cats are then returned to where they were found and allowed to live out their lives. Many of these cats were dumped by owners. The biggest problem with the colony is that other people feed the animals and throw the population out of balance with the harbor rodents the cats are there to control. MV Conception, a dive boat that caught fire and sank, was brought to the port from Santa Cruz Island overnight on September 13, 2019 to provide a secure location for the investigation. The boat was anchored near the island when the conflagration occurred at 3 a.m. on September 2, 2019. Five of the crew members escaped while 33 passengers and 1 crew member who were asleep below decks died. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the port partnered with various organizations such as World Central Kitchen, local restaurants, and other groups to feed essential workers. Since fresh produce flows through the port, they were able to direct food donations by their customers to field and packinghouse workers who may not be able to make it to a food bank that is only open while they are working.

Eisenhower's personal representative in the North African Theater of Operations. Brown led the division during training in the United States and left for the United Kingdom in October 1943, arriving in South Wales soon afterwards. The division trained there until late July 1944 when it was sent to Northern France to take part in the Allied invasion of Normandy, and saw its first combat in Operation Cobra, in an attempt to break out of the Normandy beachhead and end the temporary stalemate. He served until being relieved in August 1944 over concerns that his division was not progressing rapidly enough against German defenses.Michael E. Weaver, Guard Wars: The 28th Infantry Division in World War II, 2010, page 144 Brown's performance and subsequent reputation were mixed. Major General Charles H.

Unlike several other division commanders who were relieved and later received second opportunities to command, such as Terry Allen and Orlando Ward, in Brown's case Eisenhower recommended to George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he not be given another command, and Marshall concurred.Andrew Rawson, The Divisional Commander in the U.S. Army in World War II: A Case Study of the Normandy Campaign, 6 June 1944 to 24 July 1944, 2011, pages 128-129 Brown was replaced by James Edward Wharton, who was killed by a sniper while visiting his front line units soon after he took command.

The college was established in Dunfermline in 1905, moved to Aberdeen in 1950, and merged with Moray House College of Education, University of Edinburgh, in 1987.  History  = Dunfermline = Dunfermline College of Physical Education was founded on 4 October 1905 as Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Training, following the Report of the Royal Commission on Physical Training in Scotland published two years previously in 1903. Funding for the college was provided by Andrew Carnegie, who had established a trust to promote the physical wellbeing of the children of his home town of Dunfermline. The college's first principal was Flora Ogston, daughter of Sir Alexander Ogston, Regius Professor of Surgery, University of Aberdeen, who had trained at Chelsea College of Physical Education from 1901 - 1903. Other staff at this time included Warden of the College Ethel Adair Roberts, a graduate of Martina Bergman-Österberg's Hampstead Physical Training College, and member of the Ling Association which established the rules of netball; Leila Rendel, co-founder of the Caldecott Community; and Evelyn Perry, who was appointed by the War Office as physical training instructor of HM Munitions Factory, Gretna in 1916. Ogston stepped down as principal in 1906 when she married and was replaced by Ethel Roberts. Roberts held the post of principal for two years until her own marriage in 1908, when she was replaced Mary Stewart Tait. Ordinary Diplomas and Diplomas with Honours were awarded to students who completed the college's two-year course. The course included theoretical and practical aspects of physical education, anatomy and physiology, Pehr Henrik Ling’s Swedish gymnastics, remedial massage and voice production. Holders of the Diploma were recognised as qualified teachers of Physical Education on condition that they had also undertaken the necessary teacher training. Although it was established as a women's college, men were also admitted from 1908 onwards. In 1909 the college was recognised by the Scottish Education Department as a \\"central institution for the purpose of the Education (Scotland) Act of 1908\\", and became the central training institution for school medical officers throughout Scotland. Tait resigned as principal in 1910 and was replaced by interim principal M. L. Brailsford, until Dr A.T. Mackenzie was appointed in 1912. When it was founded, the college had one gymnasium located at Canmore Street Baths in Dunfermline. In 1909 a new college building was designed by David Barclay of Glasgow architect firm, H & D Barclay. The foundation stone was laid at Inglis Street, Dunfermline, in 1912, with the new building opening in 1914. At this point the college was renamed Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Education. Abbey Park House was acquired in 1905 as the college's first residential hostel for female students, followed by the British Linen Bank Agent's House on Canmore Street in 1919, and St Leonard's Hill mansion in 1931. In 1921 the college became associated with the National Committee for the Training of Teachers in Scotland and in 1931 the organisation established a management committee to oversee the management of the college. A voluntary third year was added to the degree programme in 1928 and became compulsory the following year in 1929. As a result of pressure on college resources and increased demand for male physical education teachers, male students, were transferred to the new Scottish School of Physical Education, which opened at Jordanhill College in Glasgow in 1931, and DCHPE reverted to training women only. Principal Mackenzie transferred to Jordanhill along with the male students in 1931 and Helen Drummond took up the post of principal of the women's college. From 1939-46 the college temporarily moved to the Teachers' Training College in Aberdeen, as its buildings in Dunfermline were requisitioned by the Royal Navy during World War II. = Aberdeen = Kepplestone House hostel, Aberdeen By 1950 the college had outgrown its site in Dunfermline so it transferred to Woolmanhill in Aberdeen, hostel premises were acquired at Queen's Road, Rubislaw and Kepplestone House. At this time the college changed its name to Dunfermline College of Physical Education, Aberdeen, and as it was no longer located in Dunfermline, the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust ended its connection with the institution. Ben Humble with Dunfermline students, Glenmore Lodge, 1955 Modern dance, education psychology, drama, art and music were added to the curriculum between 1950 and 1960. New games were also introduced including volleyball, badminton and basketball, swimming and athletics rose in prominence, and outdoor recreational sports including skiing, orienteering and golf became increasingly popular. From 1952 onwards students undertook a one-week outdoor education course led by Ben Humble at Glenmore Lodge in the Cairngorms, covering skiing, rock climbing, hillwalking, assailing and canoeing. In 1956 Helen Drummond retired after holding the post of principal for twenty-five years, she was awarded the Order of the British Empire for services to Physical Education, and replaced as college principal by N. Blunden. As the college grew it became increasingly difficult to accommodate the students and to provide facilities for games, therefore the college Governors agreed that a new location in Edinburgh should be sought. = Edinburgh = In 1966 the college moved to a new purpose build campus at Cramond in Edinburgh. The campus was intended to accommodate 80 day students and 200 residential students accommodated in three blocks named after the college's Aberdeen hostels; Queen's, Kepplestone and Rubislaw. The college buildings were designed by Sir Robert Matthew and included a teaching building with library, lecture theatre, science laboratory, art and music studios, tutorial and study rooms, and a gymnasium building with three gymnasia, swimming pool, assembly hall and dance studio. The campus also included outdoor hockey pitches, tennis courts, athletics track, jumping pits and netball courts. In 1987 the college merged with Moray House College of Education; and male students from Jordanhill College in Glasgow also joined the newly merged Scottish Centre for Physical Education, Movement and Leisure Studies (SCOPEMALS) at Moray House. Moray House merged with the University of Edinburgh in 1998 to become the university's School of Education, and in 2001 Cramond campus was closed and the school moved to St Leonards Land, Holyrood. In August 2019, the School of Education formally changed its name to Moray House School of Education and Sport.  Reputation and culture  Since its foundation, Dunfermline College was regarded as a national institution for teacher training, with students of a \\"distinctly better class in society than the ordinary teacher\\". Teaching physical education came to be regarded as a respectable career for women, with PE colleges attracting talented sportswomen and nurturing refined manners, poise and deportment. Ethel Adair, principal of the college 1906 - 1907, promoted \\"the Dunfermline mark\\" of decorum and respectable social standards. Dunfermline attracted sporting internationalists, as PE teaching was regarded as the occupation of choice at a time when it was difficult to make a living as a sportsperson. The college operated a \\"mother and daughter\\" support system, with new first year students, the daughters, being nurtured by second year mothers. Each year group was known as a set. A commemorative year book was published for each set on the year of their graduation. = Uniform = Uniform was strictly adhered to, with students being required to wear different uniforms for different sports and subjects. From 1905, for games and dance, students wore a heavy navy pinafore with square velvet yoke and blue cotton blouse, for hockey the tunic was replaced by a grey tweed skirt, hostel wear was a pinafore dress with thin flannel shirt. By the 1950s the navy pinafore had been replaced by a royal blue romper suit which allowed more freedom of movement. Grey shorts and blue Aertex blouses were worn for games, and black leotards and striped skirts for dance. The college cloak was dark green with a purple lining. Dunfermline College of Physical Education brooch The college brooch, awarded to students on graduation, features a spider and a lion rampant and bears the motto \\"Efforts are Successes\\" and the founding date of the college. In 1969 the college was granted Armorial Bearings of a shield featuring a tower representing the cities of Dunfermline, Aberdeen and Edinburgh, a leaping stag, representing flight and grace and lightning bolts, which symbolise movement and are also part of the Carnegie family crest. = Dunfermline College Old Students Association = Dunfermline College Old Students Association was founded in 1912 and is still extant. Its aim is to keep members in touch with each other and provide updates on the college and developments in physical education and teacher training. All former students of the college and graduates of the Bachelor of Education degree in PE from the Scottish Centre for Physical Education, Movement and Leisure Studies are eligible to join. The Association publishes an annual report and Set News Magazine, and organises regular reunions.  Archive  Archives of the college are held by the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Research Collections and University of Aberdeen Special Collections. In 2019, Body Language, a Wellcome Trust funded archive exhibition at University of Edinburgh Library explored the archives of Dunfermline College of Physical Education, Scottish Gymnastics, and choreographer and dance teacher Margaret Morris.

A portion of the building remains, including a 12th-century window in the east gable, restored in the 16th century with cut limestone. In the early 1800s the church was used as a school, and was modified to accommodate a thatched roof. It is now ruined. There are records of a castle on the shoreline near the graveyard and a monument higher up, overlooking it. The graveyard contains a small vaulted house called St. Colman's Oratory, with a Gothic doorway from the 16th century. The parish in 1837 was in the Catholic union of Clonrush and Inishcaltra, each of which held a chapel. In 1841 the population was 3,115 in 516 houses. The parish in 1848 contained the hamlets of Whitegate, Furnace and Fogarty's. At that time it was within County Galway. In 1898 the parishes of Inishcaltra and Clonrush were transferred from County Galway to County Clare. Today the civil parish is part of the Catholic parish of Mountshannon (Clonrush) in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. The church of St Flannan is in Whitegate.

It rises on the back side of the Hospital of the same name, in Via dei Penitenzieri, close to the crossing with Piazza della Rovere.  History  It is one of the most ancient gates in the wall surrounding the Vatican, as it is contemporary to the building of the walls of Pope Leo IV, around 850. Although it was the only direct connection between St. Peter's Basilica and the area of Trastevere (through Porta Settimiana), as well as the access to Via Aurelia nova, it was opened at first as a secondary passage. Its former name was Posterula Saxonum (Postern of the Saxons). In effect, in 727 King Ine of Wessex, after having abdicated, moved to Rome, where he founded a Schola Saxonum (whose purpose was to provide a Catholic instruction to English clergy and nobles), together with a church and a graveyard. Saxon presence in the area is attested until the end of 12th century, when King Lohn Lackland assigned the complex of the Schola to the building of the Church of Santa Maria in Saxia (now Church of Santo Spirito in Sassia) and of the still existing Hospital, whose foundations were settled in 794. On that occasion Pope Innocent III also modified the name of the gate, giving it the present one. The structure withstood several restorations and enlargements. A remarkable one was probably carried out at the beginning of the 15th century, maybe by Pope Gregory XII, given that the gate is called Porta Nuova (Italian for \\"New Gate\\") in a document dated 1409. At the beginning of the following century, Pope Alexander VI substantially modified this gate, together with other ones, as well as the surrounding wall; finally, about forty years later, Pope Paul III also made some interventions, using the advice and services of such engineers as Michelangelo and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. A new fear of raids by Saracen pirates, as well as the modern poliorcetic techniques suggesting a massive use of artilleries, persuaded Paul III to modernize the walls, giving them significant defensive characteristics. With regards to the well-known contrast between the two artists, it is said that the works of the gate were based on a beautiful design by SangalloGiorgio Vasari, in his “Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects”, thus describes Sangallo's design for Porta di Santo Spirito: “[...] it was neatly made, on a drawing by Antonio da Sangallo, with a rustic decoration of travertines, in a very solid and rare manner, with such magnificence, that it matched the ancient works.” and Buonarroti (who completed them after the death of the colleague, but in a hasty and rough way), since he could not demolish it, made some detrimental interventions to tarnish the work of the rival, as well as to take revenge for the merciless criticisms he received for his own design of Porta Pia. Presently the gate shows indeed an unfinished aspect (especially in the upper part) with empty niches, and is almost hidden by the imposing Sangallo's bastion rising in the vicinity. Moreover, a century later the gate had already lost its function (just like Porta Settimiana), as it was included within the larger circle of the Janiculum walls, and there was no need to complete it.

It was signed in Brussels, in the Spanish Netherlands, on 2 April 1656 and was signed, on Charles' behalf, by the Earl of Rochester and the Irish leader Ormonde. Alonso de Cárdenas, a former Spanish Ambassador to London, signed on behalf of Philip.Aubrey p.108 Background The exiled Royalists had previously been close to the French court, but the 1655 alliance between the English Commonwealth and the Kingdom of France drove them into the arms of France's enemy, Spain. Terms In exchange for future Spanish military support for a potential restoration, Charles agreed to raise forces to fight for Spain in the Franco-Spanish War. He also pledged to stop English colonisation in the Americas and return any territory that would be taken by the English Republic from Spain. He also agreed to help Spain fight Portugal's attempt to regain independence. Aftermath In 1657, the English Republic signed the Treaty of Paris with France, which formalised the developing Anglo- French alliance. Charles' alliance with the nation's traditional enemy, Spain, further undermined his support with the English public.Seel p. 92 Nonetheless, Royalist supporters joined the Spanish army in large numbers, led by his younger brother James, Duke of York.Childs p. 2 Large numbers of Irish troops deserted the French army to serve under York in the hope that they could invade England. However, hopes were largely dashed by the Spanish defeat to Anglo-French forces at the 1658 Battle of the Dunes and the surrender of Dunkirk. Spain then made peace with France at the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, and even the death of Oliver Cromwell did not lead to the immediate collapse of the English Republic. In 1660, Charles was restored to the crown with the assistance of English troops of the New Model Army, under George Monck. The failure of Spain however to assist Charles' return to London, meant he did not feel himself bound by the treaty and was consequently annulled. Under Charles, English settlement in the Americas continued to grow. In 1662, he made a dynastic marriage with the Portuguese Catharine of Braganza and supported Portugal's successful campaign for independence.Davenport pp. 57-59 The territory that was taken by England from Spain before 1660 was either kept or sold. Jamaica was turned into an English colony while Charles sold Dunkirk to his cousin Louis XIV.

Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, 1829 portrait Life He was the second son of Charles Sharpe (originally Charles Kirkpatrick) of Hoddam, Dumfriesshire, by Eleonora, youngest daughter of John Renton of Lamerton, born on 15 May 1781. He went to Edinburgh for schooling in 1796, and in October of that year joined John Robison's class at Edinburgh University. He returned home in May 1798. With a view to taking orders in the Scottish Episcopal Church, Sharpe matriculated in 1798 at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. 17 June 1802, and M.A. 28 June 1806. Not fitting in at his college in terms of social activity, he devoted himself mainly to antiquarian research and drawing. Instead of entering the church, Sharpe took up residence in Edinburgh in 1827, first living at 93 Princes Street a fine house facing directly onto Edinburgh Castle.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1827 He later moved to 28 Drummond Place in Edinburgh's Second New Town.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1850 Whilst being a welcome guest in society, he was in fact a literary recluse, who made no effort to keep up with fashion in his dress. Sharpe died unmarried, 17 March 1851. Works Sharpe contributed ballads to the second volume of Walter Scott's Border Minstrelsy. In 1807 he also published at Oxford Metrical Legends and other Poems. In 1823 he published his Ballad Book, which in 1880 was re-edited by David Laing, with additions from Sharpe's manuscripts. To Laing's edition of William Stenhouse's notes to James Johnson's Scots Musical Museum (1853), he made some contributions. In 1817 Sharpe edited James Kirkton's Secret and True History of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Year 1678, with an Account of the Murder of Archbishop Sharpe, by James Russell, an Actor therein, with notes. It was followed in 1820 by an edition of Robert Law's Memorialls; or the considerable Things that fell out within the Island of Great Britain from 1638 to 1684, containing information on witchcraft and related topics. In 1827 he edited A Part of the Life of Lady Margaret Cunninghame, daughter of the Earl of Glencairn, that she had with her first Husband, the Earl of Evandale; in 1828 (for the Bannatyne Club), The Letters of Archibald, Earl of Argyle; and in 1837, Surgundo, or the Valiant Christian, a Catholic song for the victory at the Battle of Glenlivet in 1594; and the same year, Minuets and Songs of Thomas, sixth Earl of Kellie. In drawing, Sharpe's strength was satirical or grotesque caricature. His frontispieces and illustrations in the Bannatyne Club and other antiquarian publications applied antiquarian knowledge. In 1833 he published a volume of etchings, under the title Portraits of an Amateur, and his Etchings, with Photographs from Original Drawings, Poetical and Prose Fragments, appeared after his death at Edinburgh in 1869.

Tn-seq: high-throughput parallel sequencing for fitness and genetic interaction studies in microorganisms. Nat Methods. 2009;6:767–72. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.1377.. Numerous variations have been subsequently developed and applied to diverse biological systems. Collectively, the methods are often termed Tn-Seq as they all involve monitoring the fitness of transposon insertion mutants via DNA sequencing approaches . Transposons are highly regulated, discrete DNA segments that can relocate within the genome. They are universal and are found in Eubacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, including humans. Transposons have a large influence on gene expression and can be used to determine gene function. In fact, when a transposon inserts itself in a gene, the gene's function will be disrupted. Because of that property, transposons have been manipulated for use in insertional mutagenesis. The development of microbial genome sequencing was a major advance for the use of transposon mutagenesis. The function affected by a transposon insertion could be linked to the disrupted gene by sequencing the genome to locate the transposon insertion site. Massively parallel sequencing allows simultaneous sequencing of transposon insertion sites in large mixtures of different mutants. Therefore, genome-wide analysis is feasible if transposons are positioned throughout the genome in a mutant collection. Transposon sequencing requires the creation of a transposon insertion library, which will contain a group of mutants that collectively have transposon insertions in all non-essential genes. The library is grown under an experimental condition of interest. Mutants with transposons inserted in genes required for growth under the test condition will diminish in frequency from the population. To identify mutants being lost, genomic sequences adjacent to the transposon ends are amplified by PCR and sequenced by MPS to determine the location and abundance of each insertion mutation. The importance of each gene for growth under the test condition is determined by comparing the abundance of each mutant before and after growth under the condition being examined. Tn-seq is useful for both the study of a single gene's fitness as well as gene interactions Signature–tagged mutagenesis (STM) is an older technique that also involves pooling transposon insertion mutants to determine the importance of the disrupted genes under selective growth conditions. High-throughput versions of STM use genomic microarrays, which are less accurate and have a lower dynamic range than massively-parallel sequencing. With the invention of next generation sequencing, genomic data became increasingly available. However, despite the increase in genomic data, our knowledge of gene function remains the limiting factor in our understanding of the role genes play. Therefore, a need for a high throughput approach to study genotype-phenotype relationships like Tn-seq was necessary.  Methodology  Transposon insertion using the Tn-seq method. Transposon sequencing begins by transducing bacterial populations with transposable elements using bacteriophages. Tn-seq uses the Himar I Mariner transposon, a common and stable transposon. After transduction, the DNA is cleaved and the inserted sequence amplified through PCR. The recognition sites for MmeI, a type IIS restriction endonuclease, can be introduced by a single nucleotide change in the terminal repeats of Mariner. It is located 4 bp before the end of the terminal repeat. MmeI makes a 2 bp staggered cut 20 bases downstream of the recognition site. When MmeI digests DNA from a library of transposon insertion mutants, fragmented DNA including the left and right transposon and 16 bp of surrounding genomic DNA is produced. The 16 bp fragment is enough to determine the location of the transposon insertion in the bacterial genome. The ligation of the adaptor is facilitated by the 2 base overhang. A primer specific to the adaptor and a primer specific to the transposon are used to amplify the sequence via PCR. The 120 bp product is then isolated using agarose gel or PAGE purification. Massively parallel sequencing is then used to determine the sequences of the flanking 16 bp. Gene function is inferred after looking at the effects of the insertion on gene function under certain conditions.  Advantages and disadvantages  Unlike high-throughput insertion track by deep sequencing (HITS) and transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS), Tn-seq is specific to the Himar I Mariner transposon, and cannot be applied to other transposons or insertional elements. However, the protocol for Tn-seq is less time intensive. HITS and TraDIS use a DNA shearing technique that produce a range of PCR product sizes that could cause shorter DNA templates being preferentially amplified over longer templates. Tn-seq produces a product that is uniform in size, therefore reducing the possibility of PCR bias. Tn-seq can be used to identify both the fitness of single genes and to map gene interactions in microorganisms. Existing methods for these types of study are dependent on preexisting genomic microarrays or gene knockout arrays, whereas Tn-seq is not. Tn-seq's utilization of massively parallel sequencing makes this technique easily reproducible, sensitive, and robust.  Applications  Tn-seq has proven to be a useful technique for identifying new gene functions. The highly sensitive nature of Tn-seq can be used to determine phenotype- genotype relationships that may have been deemed insignificant by less sensitive methods. Tn-seq identified essential genes and pathways that are important for the utilization of cholesterol in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tn-seq has been used to study higher order genome organization using gene interactions. Genes function as a highly linked network; in order to study a gene's impact on phenotype, gene interactions must also be considered. These gene networks can be studied by screening for synthetic lethality and gene interactions where a double mutant shows an unexpected fitness value compared to each individual mutant. Tn-seq was used to determine genetic interactions between five query genes and the rest of the genome in Streptococcus pneumoniae, which revealed both aggravating and alleviating genetic interactions.van Opijnen T, Bodi KL, Camilli A. Tn-seq: high-throughput parallel sequencing for fitness and genetic interaction studies in microorganisms. Nat Methods. 2009;6:767–72. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.1377. One of the genes studied (ccpA) was found to interact with 64 other genes and is thought to be a master regulator complex carbohydrate metabolism in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Tn-seq used in combination with RNA-seq can be utilized to examine the role of non-coding DNA regions. This method identified 56 new sRNAs in non-coding regions of S. pneumoniae.

Designed by Marcello Piacentini, chief architect of the Italian Fascist regime, it served as the Jerusalem branch of the Assicurazioni Generali insurance company from 1935 to 1946. In 1946 the British Mandatory government nationalized the building and enclosed it and several other structures at the eastern end of Jaffa Road in a fortified security zone. With the end of the Mandatory government in 1948, the building was taken by the Irgun. Since the establishment of the state, the Generali Building has housed the offices of the Jerusalem District Administration and other government agencies, and street-level stores. The building's neoclassical and modern architecture, and large, rooftop sculpture of a Lion of Saint Mark have made it a prominent landmark in downtown Jerusalem. Location The Generali Building is located in Bar Kochba Square at the intersection of Jaffa Road and Queen Shlomzion Street. Architecture Close-up of Lion of Saint Mark statue on the roof Situated at the intersection of Jaffa Road and Queen Shlomzion Street, the sides of the triangular-shaped Generali Building splay out in a V-shape, with the corner facing the intersection designed like the prow of a ship. The first story is faced with roughly-dressed stone and has arched windows and doorways. The upper stories, in contrast, are faced with finely-dressed stone and have windows and balconies opening at right angles, along with horizontal stone protrusions demarcating each story. Due to the topography of the site, the building has five stories at its western end and a wing of six stories at its eastern end. Atop the roof is a large stone sculpture of a winged lion leaning on an open book. While many observers mistakenly attribute this symbol to the Lion of Judah, emblem of the city of Jerusalem, it is in fact the Lion of Saint Mark, patron saint of Venice, and the symbol of the Generali insurance company. This symbol has appeared on all of the company's branches worldwide since 1848. The Latin words engraved on the stone book are Pax Tibi Marce Evangelista Meus (Peace unto you, Mark, my Evangelist). On the base of the sculpture are engraved the Roman numerals MDCCCXXXI, or 1831, the year that Assicurazioni Generali was founded. The sculpture was constructed in six sections and produced by Jerusalem artist David Ozhernesky together with two Italian assistants. The name of the insurance company appears in relief under the roof line. History Generali Building, circa 1935–1946. The Generali Building was one of three commercial structures built at the eastern end of Jaffa Road in the 1930s. The others, constructed by the British, were the Anglo-Palestine Bank (currently Bank Leumi) and the Central Post Office. In 1931, Assicurazioni Generali, marking its centenary since its founding in Trieste, Italy, in 1831, decided to open a branch in Jerusalem. It acquired the lot in downtown Jerusalem – which was being used as a bus parking lot – from British Mandate officials. The company hired Israeli architect Richard Kauffmann, designer of Jerusalem garden suburbs such as Rehavia, Beit Hakerem, and Talpiot, to draw up a plan. Kaufmann submitted a plan for a seven-story structure in International Style, with \\"a rounded corner and flowing lines\\". Company executives rejected Kaufmann's plan and turned to Italian architect Marcello Piacentini, chief architect of the Italian Fascist regime, for an alternative. Piacentini submitted a design for a triangular building that combined neoclassical and modern elements with a subdued and \\"non-jarring\\" appearance, a common look in 1930s Fascist architecture in Italy. Piacentini's plan was accepted and the De Farro firm was hired to begin construction in 1934. The building was completed in 1935. The Jerusalem branch of the Assicurazioni Generali insurance company occupied the main floor of the building from 1935 to 1946. Office space on upper floors and shops at street level were rented out to private businesses. =Bevingrad= Partial view of Princess Mary Street (today Queen Shlomzion Street) in Bevingrad. The Generali Building is at right. Irgun taking the Generali Building following the British evacuation, 1948 Beginning in 1944, the Irgun stepped up its attacks against British installations in Palestine, prompting the British to begin fortifying those installations. Security zones with huge coils of barbed wire filling the streets and dragon's teeth blocking the incursion of armed vehicles began appearing around Jerusalem. Jerusalemites called the fortified zones \\"Bevingrad\\", a portmanteau of the name of the British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, who had denied Holocaust survivors entry to Palestine, and the Russian city of Stalingrad, where large-scale fortifications had been emplaced prior to the 1942 Battle of Stalingrad. One such zone, established in 1946,Jewish Agency for Israel (1949). The Jewish Agency's Digest of Press and Events, Vol. 2, p. 61. encompassed the eastern end of Jaffa Road and included the Russian Compound, the Anglo-Palestine Bank, the Central Post Office, and the Generali Building. (subscription)Rosenne, Shabtai. \\"The United Nations and Israel's War of Independence\\", in An International Law Miscellany. 1993: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, p. 646. . That same year, the British had evacuated the Generali Building of its tenants and nationalized the building. From 1946 to 1948 the Generali Building housed several British military functions, including the main quartermaster. A machine gun was mounted on the \\"middle balcony\\" of the Generali Building and trained on Jaffa Road. On 14 May 1948, when the British Mandatory government pulled out of Palestine, Irgun fighters mounted Operation Kilshon to take the Bevingrad buildings. The first one to be recovered was the Generali Building, where fighters hoisted the Israeli flag over the lion sculpture on the roof before continuing on to take control of the Russian Compound. Current tenants The building houses government offices, including the Jerusalem District Administration, the Ministry of Interior, the Department of Immigration and Population Registry, and the Internal Auditing Office. Long-time businesses at street level include a branch of Union Bank of Israel and Rejwan Travel Service, one of the oldest travel agencies in Jerusalem. An Israel Meteorological Service measuring station has operated on the roof of the Generali Building since December 1949. In January 1993 this station was upgraded with an \\"automatic observation post\\" that generates weather data every ten minutes. In January 1974 the station recorded the strongest gust of wind ever in Israel, measuring .

The draw served as a staging area for freight wagons carrying supplies to the Black Hills and contains ruts caused by the wheels of the freight wagons and the animals that pulled them. The draw is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Background In 1868, the U.S. government signed the Fort Laramie Treaty, which promised the Lakota people that the Black Hills would be exempt from white settlement. However, in 1874, an expedition into the Black Hills led by George Armstrong Custer, found deposits of gold. In 1876, Custer's discovery of gold led to the Black Hills Gold Rush. Initially, the U. S. government attempted to purchase or lease the Black Hills from the Lakota, but the government was unwilling to pay the price asked by the Lakota. When the talks broke down, the U. S. government ignored the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 and allowed the gold seekers to rush into the Black Hills. The Black Hills gold rush subsequently created a high demand for supplies by the gold seekers. In 1876, Sidney, Nebraska was a small town on the Union Pacific railroad. Sidney had two main advantages over other railroad towns in Nebraska as a staging point for supplying the gold rush in the Black Hills. First, there already was a trail from Sidney north to the Red Cloud Agency, which was protected by the military between Fort Sidney and Fort Robinson. Second, the route was shorter than other possible supply points along the railroad and with the building of the Clarke Bridge toll bridge over the North Platte River by Henry T. Clarke, Sr., travel on Sidney-Black Hills Trail became easier for freight wagons. With the opening of the Clarke bridge, the Sidney-Black Hills trail began carrying larger quantities of freight to and from the Black Hills mining operations. During the summer of 1876, the Pony Express began operating along the trail, as did several stagecoach lines. In 1876, there were an estimated 10,000 gold seekers in the Black Hills and their demand for supplies was so high that approximately 50 to 75 freight wagons left daily from Sidney, each wagon carrying of supplies. In 1879, the Black Hills gold rush ended and so did the need for high passenger service along the trail. Company gold mining, however, continued and so the need for freight transportation along the trail increased. From 1878 to 1879, an estimated of supplies were transported to and from Sidney. By 1880, with the completion of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad to Pierre, the transportation of freight along the trail dramatically dropped. It was quicker and cheaper to transport supplies along the new railroad than to use freight wagons along the Sidney-Black Hills trail. By the end of 1882, the trail was completely closed. Description Deadwood Draw is located about northwest of Sidney, Nebraska, and close to the Union Pacific railroad from which supplies could be loaded onto freight wagons headed for the Black Hills via the Sidney- Black Hills trail. The draw is a wide, flat area that gently slopes up and out of Lodgepole Creek Valley and away from Union Pacific railroad and on to the Sidney-Black Hills trail. A gully channel meanders along the draw and ranges in depth from to . As of 1992, there were three sets of wagon-wheel ruts and ruts cause by the oxen and horses that pulled the wagons. The rut pairs range in width from to . Historical significance Deadwood Draw was a staging area for freight wagons using the Sidney-Black Hills trail. As of 1992, when it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, it had well- preserved ruts caused by freight wagons, stage coaches, and the animals that pulled them from 1874 to 1881. On the south end of the draw there is a depression in the ground that is thought to be the remnants of a 19th-century dugout that may have been occupied during the period of historical significance. Close to the middle of the draw is a small limestone quarry that supplied much of the limestone used to construct early buildings in Sidney.

In December 2013, the foundation laid out its goals for a national monument. They included: *Expressing the gratitude of the nation to Gold Star mothers and families; *Recognizing the loss incurred by Gold Star mothers and families; *Giving Gold Star mothers and families a place to reflect, contemplate, and meditate on their loss; *Giving Gold Star mothers and families a place to gather; *Commemorating the national service that the Gold Star Mothers Club has provided to the nation; and *Providing a place for the public to acknowledge the sacrifices of Gold Star mothers and families, and to commemorative this sacrifice. The foundation began analyzing sites suggested by the NCMAC in 2013. It rejected Freedom Plaza, the belvedere western terminus of Constitution Avenue on the shores of the Potomac River, and sites on Memorial Drive close to the Arlington National Cemetery Administration Building. On December 12, 2013, it asked the NCMAC to approve a site on Memorial Drive between the south main gate of Arlington National Cemetery and the Armored Forces Memorial.

He was born in Kirkstyle, Riccarton, Scotland. Their Riccarton farm in New Zealand was the first permanent settlement by immigrants on the Canterbury Plains. Deans emigrated to Wellington, New Zealand, after buying land orders from the New Zealand Company in 1839. He arrived in what was then known as Port Nicholson (Wellington Harbour) on 22 January 1840 on the Aurora. Disappointed with what he found at Wellington, he started looking for other land. In Port Levy, he heard in mid 1842 of the large plains to the west of Banks Peninsula and travelling up the Avon River by whaleboat, he could eventually see from atop the shoulders of one of his travelling companions the lowland forest that became known as Riccarton Bush. He exclaimed: \\"That will do for me! I will make it my home.\\" Deans returned to Wellington and convinced his brother John, who had since emigrated to Nelson and was equally disappointed, to move to Canterbury. In February 1843, William Deans sailed south with two other families (Gebbie and Manson) who also wanted to settle in Canterbury. They took timber for a building with them that Samuel Manson, a skilled carpenter, erected for him. John Deans sailed from Wellington to New South Wales to buy stock. He arrived in Port Cooper (since renamed Port Lyttelton) in June 1843, having suffered the loss of many animals in the rough passage. 61 cattle, 3 mares and 43 sheep eventually arrived at their farm. In late 1843, Manson built another house. That building is still in existence and is known as Deans Cottage. In December 1846, the Deans brothers signed a 21-year lease with a Māori chief, Te One, for land within of their farm. From 1848, they had to negotiate about land with first the New Zealand Company and then the Canterbury Association, after Canterbury had been bought from Māori in Kemp's Deed. Once a provisional agreement had been arrived at in May 1851, William Deans sailed for Australia to obtain more stock. His ship, the Maria, foundered at Cape Terawhiti and Deans was drowned on 23 July 1851. Earlier in 1851, George Grey as governor had invited Deans to join the New Zealand Legislative Council. As the council was meeting in Wellington, Deans had declined as it was \\"quite out of [his] way\\". A homestead, Riccarton House, was built on the Riccarton property in 1856; this was several years after William Deans' death.

RAT\\" pioneering the movement in the Netherlands. He was a well known supporter of the association football club AFC Ajax, and would commonly tag \\"AJAKS\\" next to his name, misspelling it on purpose. He is largely considered the pioneer of the graffiti movement in the country, emerging out of the punk rock scene of the late 1970s. Biography Born in Amsterdam 21 May 1960 to a Latvian father and a Dutch mother who were both studying at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie,Godfather van de Nederlandse graffiti geëerd, door Daniël Bertina, Het Parool, 29 juni 2011 he was the first known graffiti artist in the Netherlands, and played a major role in the punk rock scene in Amsterdam in the late 1970s. He made his first graffiti in Hondecoeterstraat as a child. It was near Nicolaas Maesstraat, where he then lived with his parents. Together with Diana Ozon he founded the famed punk club DDT666 (Dirty Dutch Trix 666), and was also a contributor the fanzine de Koekrant dedicated to punk rock and street culture, while working on other art related projects as well.Punkclub DDT666, door Diana Ozon, Punt.nl, 27 October 2007Oergraffiti Dr. Rat weer zichtbaar(in Dutch) Retrieved on 26 Feb 2018 The graffiti culture was born in Netherlands at the same time it was in the USA, but is connected with the punk rather than with hip-hop as it is in New York. He had a short lasting relationship with German singer and actress Nina Hagen, who had advised him to change his name to \\"DR. ART\\". Aside from the pseudonyms Dr. Rat and Dr. Art, Vičs other known aliases include Fritz Zanzibar, Stanley Sneeuwschoen de Verschrikkelijke, and Dr. Death, with which he would commonly sign his paintings. A majority of DR. RAT's work in Amsterdam is no longer visible. His contemporaries largely consider him as a cult figure and an enfant terrible. Ivar Vičs was always seeking out the extremities in life, frequently experimenting with drugs and alcohol which eventually led to his untimely death. After his passing Diana Ozon dedicated a poem to him, punk rock band \\"The Helmettes\\" wrote a song dedicated to Dr. Rat, and Nina Hagen released the song \\"Dr. Art\\" dedicated to Ivar as well. Rare footage of Dr. Rat was featured in the 2006 documentary film Kroonjuwelen, and in 2011, journalist Martijn Haas published a biography of Ivar Vičs under the title Dr. Rat, godfather of Dutch graffiti.

Writing under the pseudonym Maria de Bell-lloc (sometimes spelled Bell-lloch), that she used her entire career, she is notable as one of the first Spanish women folklorists and the first woman novelist to be published in Catalan.  Biography  Maria de Bell-lloc (in English: Maria of the Beautiful Place) was a writer of the Renaissance Catalan period and was very active from her start in 1865. She was influenced by trends in this movement, which became known for romanticism of medieval characters, patriotism and traditionalism. She was also one of the first folklorist women, conducting field work to collect and transcribe Catalan legends and ethnographic narratives that she later recreated and edited. Maria wrote about her Catalan heritage and her stories and poems were set in the themes and landscapes of the Vallès region near Barcelona, Spain. It was a place that was very dear to her as the Maspons family owned the manor house at Bigues and often visited there. Her poetry was published in numerous magazines and Catalan periodicals during her lifetime. Between 1865 and 1882, her writing appeared in such reviews as Calendari Català (Catalan Calendar), Lo Gay Saber, La Renaxensa, La Veu de Montserrat, La Llumanera de Nova York (The New York Feather), La Veu de Catalunya and Il·lustració Catalana. She also published two collections of poems Salabrugas (1874) and Poesies (Poems, undated). In a presentation of the book Llegendari (Book of Legends), Joan Armangué i Herrero confirmed that Maria was an essential member of the folklorist movement. She is known for being the first author to publish a novel in contemporary Catalan literature, Vigatans i botiflers (Loyalists and Traitors, published between 1878-1879), and set during the War of Spanish Succession (1701-1714). (The war was triggered by the death of the childless monarch Charles II of Spain). Her book describes the deaths of fighters for independence during the war and the loss of Catalan rights. In May 1879, Maria published two special poems and legends in a special issue of The New York Feather dedicated to Catalan women and created by writer Dolors Monserdà. On May 13, 1880, the Catalan Excursions Association organized a literary evening in which Maria's Montseny traditions were read. In 1885 Maria was named an honorary member of the Catalan Folklore Section of the Catalan Excursions Association. A few years later, Maria would face the final stage of her production with the publication in The Catalan Illustration of \\"Four Traditions\\" (1889) and \\"Four Other Traditions of the Time of the Recapture\\" (1894). Maria Maspons was known to have carried out exhaustive fieldwork of Catalan folklore with her brother, the writer Francisco Maspons y Labrós (in Catalan, his name is Francesc de Sales Maspons i Labrós), and her brother-in- law Francesc Pelai Briz. Together, they set out to gather manifestations of Catalan folk literature. Francesc de Sales collected fables, children's games and traditions, Francesc Pelai concentrated on songs and riddles, and Maria de Bell-lloc gathered legends and traditions. Selected works Her works include poems and legends. *Lloances (Praises) (1866) *Salabrugas, poesias catalanas (Salabrugas, Catalan Poetry) (1874), featuring a prologue by Joan Sardà *Narracions y llegendas (Stories and Legends) (1875) *Vigatans y botiflers, novela histórica (Loyalists and Traitors, historical novel) (1878) *Montseny (1880), a collection of six legends about this mountain. *Llegendas catalanas (Catalan legends) (1881) *Costums i tradicions del Vallès (Customs and traditions of the Vallès) (1882), with a first part dedicated to the description of customs, beliefs and popular festivals, and a second part with 22 legends about places in the Vallès region. *Elisabeth de Mur (Elizabeth of Mur) (1924), which included more than 70 stories and narratives. *Poesies (Poems, undated)  Awards  While she did not receive any prizes for her poetry, she did earn several for other writing. * First accession to the jasmine of silver in Lleida in 1869. * Special Mention at the Floral Games literary competition of Barcelona in 1875, for Narrations and legends. * Artistic and Allegorical Jewel award of the Catalan Excursions Association in 1880 for her collection of legends titled Montseny. * Scientific-Literary Prize of the Granoller's Casino in 1882 for a collection of stories, Costums i tradicions del Vallès (Customs and Traditions of the Vallès).

Her works are multilayered using devices that reflect an interest with the beginnings of language including early man-made marks and the ogham and bardic alphabets. She has exhibited across Wales, and internationally.  Work  Lloyd Jones was born in Devil's Bridge, Cardiganshire, and attended art school immediately on leaving school. Her ambition was always to be an artist. However, she did not begin to exhibit work publicly until 1966 when she was in her early 30s. Ceridwen Lloyd Morgan attributes this relatively late flowering to the fact that she was a Welsh woman from a rural background. As Lloyd Jones has stated: \\"At times I felt that I belonged to the wrong sex and was living in the wrong time and place to be a successful artist.\\" In 1989 she gave up her job as visual arts officer for Dyfed to become a full-time artist. From this point her work evolved to take the form of large irregularly shaped paintings which were unstretched. Such works were associated with cloth, stitching and dye-soaking into the cloth. Later she returned to more traditional forms of painting as well as producing proclamatory banners. Lost Language Lloyd Jones' work is greatly inspired by the landscape in which she grew up, a prominent feature of which is the scarred landscape associated with a legacy of lead mining. This sense of place is further augmented by her own Welsh language cultural inheritance. Ann Price-Owen has referred to her work as that of a custodian of her cultural heritage which is implicitly language based. Experiences outside Wales have also provided key stages in her work's development. An interest in early alphabets was precipitated by a visit to Ilkley Moor to view cup and ring marks. Incorporation of such marks into the work led to an identification with the 18th-century Welsh bard, scholar and antiquarian Iolo Morganwg who created his own bardic alphabet, \\"Coelbren\\". She counts the use of scripts such as the ancient ogham script in her work as an oblique reference to the otherness of Welshness. Iwan Bala argues that these works demand some form of contextualising revealing the artist's concerns and her position within her own culture. In the Summer of 2009 Ruthin Craft Centre showed Lloyd Jones' early textile work which led to a re-evaluation of this work by a new audience. A second show in 2013 was reviewed in the magazine Embroidery. In February 2013 she was awarded the first Artist Residency at the Old College, Aberystwyth University and moved into a new studio there. Some of her paintings are in the public collections of the National Library of Wales, National Museum of Wales and Cardiff University. In October 2014 she published her autobiography, No Mod Cons, an account of her struggles both to paint and her own attempts to organise a better world for Welsh artists.No Mod Cons, Welsh Books Council.

She was also a prominent feminist cultural and anti-Franco activist. Along with the writers Manuel de Pedrolo, Jordi Sarsanedas, Joan Perucho, and Josep Maria Espinàs, Capmany co-authored, Cita de narradors (\\"Rendezvous of Narrators\\") (1958), which was awarded the Josep Yxart Essay Prize.  Biography  Granddaughter of Sebastià Farnés (1854-1934), intellectual author of Paremiologia catalana comparada, and daughter of Aureli Capmany i Farrés, folklorist and contributor of children's magazines, she spent her youth in the family's apartment near la Rambla in Barcelona. She studied at the Institut-Escola de la Generalitat de Catalunya and she graduated on Philosophy at the University of Barcelona after the war. She practiced teaching during the 40s and 50s at the Institut Albéniz of Badalona and at the Escola Isabel de Villena in Barcelona. She also worked engraving glass, a job that she had learnt at University. With her first novel Necessitem morir (We need to die) (published in 1952), she got to the final of the Joanot Martorell Price of 1947, price that she won the following year with El cel no és trasparent (The sky is not transparent). Her prestige as a narrator would arrive with novels like Betúlia, El gust de la pols (The flavour of dust) and especially for Un lloc entre els morts (A place for the death), Sant Jordi Price of 1968. In 1981 she received the Ramon Fuster Price, given by the Col·legi Oficial de Doctors i Llicenciats en Filosofia i Lletres i en Ciències de Catalunya and in 1983 she won the Premi Crítica Serra d'Or de Literatura Infantil i Juvenil with El malefici de la reina d'Hongria (The curse of the Hungarian Queen). She was one of the most versatile Catalan writers, as apart from writing fiction, she was also devoted to translation, and she worked on the theatrical genre as well as on other literary genres. In the field of dramaturgy, she founded in 1959 the Escola d'Art Dramàtic Adrià Gual (School of Dramatic Arts Adrià Gual) together with Ricard Salvat. She exercised as a teacher, actress and headmaster. Besides, she premiered own plays, such as Preguntes i respostes sobre la vida i la mort de Francesc Layret advocat dels obrers de Catalunya (Answers and questions about life and dead of Francesc Layret, lawyer of Catalan workers). As an essay writer, she excelled for her works on the situation of women, especially with La dona a Catalunya: consciència i situació (The woman in Catalonia: awareness and situation) in 1966. The same year, she took part in the Caputxinada, an assembly against the Spanish dictator Franco. She also devoted many articles to several aspects of Catalan culture and society. The book of memories Pedra de toc (1 and 2), Mala memòria, and Això era i no era also excelled. She took part and intervened in the Míting de la Llibertat (Meeting of freedom) (June 22, 1976) and in the constitutional process of Socialist Party of Catalonia- Congress (November 1976). She was councillor and responsible for Culture and Editions at Barcelona's Town Hall during the first legislatures of the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC) and member of the Diputation of Barcelona, since 1983 until she died on 2 October 1991. She was also member of the Associació d'Escriptors en Llengua Catalana, and president of the Catalan PEN Club, the Catalan version of the PEN International.

He was also known for his set and costume designs for theatre and film. Biography Born in Havana on September 19, 1946, Randy Barceló left Cuba through Operation Pedro Pan at the age of 14. He studied art at University of Puerto Rico and in 1965 moved to New York where he enrolled in the Lester Pollard Theatre Forum School of Design. Barceló began his career as a dancer and choreographer. At the age of 24, he worked as a designer for the Broadway musical, 'Lenny'. In 1972 he designed the costumes for Jesus Christ Superstar and was nominated for a Tony Award, the first Hispanic nominee for costume design. He went on to design costumes for several on- and off- Broadway plays and musicals, ballet and dance productions, and operas. Barceló's art-work, primarily abstract and figurative sketches and paintings, have been shown in several galleries and museums including the Cooper Hewitt Museum, Hudson River Museum, and Kennedy Center for Performing Arts.

He was president of the board of regents of the Maryland Agriculture College from 1812 to 1813.  Early life  Warfield was born in Anne Arundel County, Maryland on December 3, 1751, and was the son of Azel Warfield and Sarah A Griffith He attended the University of Philadelphia without graduation. He was a leader of the Whig Club at the beginning of the American Revolution. His members wore hats inscribed \\"Liberty and Independence, or the Death in pursuit of it\\". On October 19, 1774, was one of the leaders that burned the Peggy Stewart in retaliation to sanctions on Americans following the Boston Tea Party.

The same year he started construction on his slave plantation manor home. The property later was owned by the \\"Hammond\\" family of the Major Charles Family line. The manor stood for over 150 years, burning in 1933 and demolished in 1947. A new house was built over the original foundation. In 1978 the property was purchased by the Clevenger family and had been subdivided down to 342 acres, but was still actively farmed. In 1983 it had been subdivided down to a 190-acre parcel named \\"Bushy Park Farm\\" and sold again. A portion of the original estate became the Carr's Mill Landfill, which became a site of hazardous waste dumping by Western Electric in the 1970s. Howard County spent millions of dollars to cap the landfill and dispose of hazardous materials after contamination of groundwater on the site. Warfield is buried at Bushy Park. The walled cemetery remains, but the majority of the 1300-acre farm has been redeveloped as the Western Regional Park, operated by Howard County.

Its cast was made up entirely of amateur actors, many of them the real crew of a hospital ship of the Italian navy. The production was a work of propaganda intended to support the war aims of the Fascist Italian regime during the Second World War. It was made with the close co- operation of the Italian Navy, particularly Francesco De Robertis. Vittorio Mussolini, the son of the Italian dictator, was also a supporter of the project. It was the first feature film directed by Rossellini, and commenced what has been described as his \\"Fascist Trilogy\\" which also includes A Pilot Returns (1942) and The Man with a Cross (1943). Along with a number of other films of the era, it is considered a precursor to Italian neorealism. Rossellini went on to be a leading Italian filmmaker, and a major figure in the development of neorealism. The film was screened at the 1941 Venice Film Festival, before going on general release the following year. Because of this 1941 and 1942 are both often cited as its release date. It was awarded the Cup of the National Fascist Party at Venice.Bondanella p.153 Synopsis A young Italian sailor falls in love with a schoolteacher before returning to service on a warship.

Shuhdha was called \\"the calligrapher, the pride of womanhood, a muhaddithah (female of muhaddith) of Iraq with a high Isnad.\\" Name Her full name stands Fakhr-un-Nisa Shuhdah Umm Muhammad bint Abu Nasr. Fakhr-un-Nisa, in Arabic means the \\"Glory of Womanhood.\\" She was tilted Shuhdah al-Baghdadiyyah or the \\"Writer of Baghdad\\" and al Katibah, or the female scriber. Early life and education Fakhr-un- Nisa Shuhdah was born in early 11th century in the Iranian city of Dinawar to Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn al-Faraj al-Dinawari (d.574). Her great-grandfather had been a dealer in needles, and thus acquired the soubriquet al-Ibri'. But was her father who had acquired a passion for hadith, and managed to study it with several masters of the subject. Abiding the Sunnah, he himself gave his daughter a sound academic education, ensuring that she studied under many traditionists of accepted reputation. Fakhr-un-Nisa then studied hadith with the famous teachers of Baghdad: Triad ibn Muhammad al-Zaynabi, Ibn Talhah al- Ni’ali, Anu I’Hasan ibn Ayyub, Abu I-Khattab ibn Batir, Ahmad ibn ‘Abd al- Qadir ibn Yusuf, and others. She also received Hadith lessons and studied other branches of knowledge under the guidance of reputed scholars like Abu ‘Abdullah Hasan ibn Ahmad Nomani, Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ahmad-As-Shashi, and Abu-Al-Husayni. At that time, the women would begin their studies with the knowledgeable men and women within the household. Then they would continue with local teachers outside of the family circle. If they aspired to pursue further education, they would go to the teachers in other towns and cities.  Scholarship and contributions =Hadith literature= Al-Muwatta: Imam Malik's best-known work, Al-Muwatta was the first written collection of hadith comprising the subjects of Muslim law, compiled and edited by the Imam, Malik ibn Anas. Al-Muwatta consists of approximately 1,720 hadiths. Shuhdah al Baghdadiyyah studied them all. Al-Mashyakhat: This is an arrangement of hadith by the shaykhs or teachers of those hadith. Shuhdah l-Baghdadiyyah studied the Mashayakhah of ibn Sahdhan with Abu Ghalib Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Baqillani. Al-Ajza: Al-Ajza is the plural of juz and means component section of something. Here it is referring to the hadiths of just one person or hadiths collected on just one topic. During the fourth century A.H. onward, women showed great interest in studying them. Shuhdah studied the most famous, Juz ibn Arafah, with its highest narrator Ibn Bayan; Juz Ibn hanbal, with Abu I-Hasan ibn al-Tuyuri; and Juz Hilal al-Haffar with Tirad. Al-Musalsalat: the term musalsal refers to a hadith around the narration of which there is some particular association that the tradition has deemed worthy of preserving along with the hadith itself. She studied al-Musafahah of al-Barqani. Shuhdah narrated the Mu’jam of al-Isma’ili and the Mashyakhah of Ibn Shadhan. Her student Abl al Aziz ibn Mahmud ibn al-Mubarak ibn al-Akhdar compiled the Mashayakhah Shuhdah in her lifetime. It has 114 narrations and most of them are prophetic hadiths drawn from 27 of her shaykhs. Shuhdah commanded a great name in the studies of Hadith. The seekers of learning came from distant places and took it as a mark of pride if they were allowed to join her session of Dars. Many scholars of great fame were said to be a regular audience of her tautology and would acquire authority from her to report the hadith on behalf of her. She not only exhibited her erudition in Hadith study, but also would deliver scholarly speeches on history, linguistics and literature, leaving lasting impressions on the hearts and the souls of her audience. =Calligraphy= She achieved perfection in the art of calligraphy, compelling the master calligraphist of her time to appreciate her. She came to acquire the title of Fakhr-un-Nisa (Pride of the Women) for her erudition, calligraphic art, and highly acclaimed oratory.  Later life and death  Fakhr-un-Nisa Shuhdha's husband died after forty years of marriage. She endured the great shock with courage and patience and occupied herself with learning and educating. The caliph Al-Muqtadi Bi-amr-Allah granted her a large estate to enhance the scope of her scholarly activities. She, with the help of donations established a grand institution (Darsgah) on the banks of the river Tigris, where hundreds of students pursued their studies and all expenses were taken care of by FakhrShuhdah herself. She died in 1112 at the age of more than 90. Her funeral prayer was offered at Jama’e Al-Qasr in Baghdad. Thousands of people, including the scholars, students, and state dignitaries are said to have participated in her funeral proceedings.  Legacy Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi praised her for her piety, works of calligraphy and charity. Al-Safadi notes her extensive knowledge of hadith and her piety, taqwa and benevolence.

Press and publication in Jordan On July 1, 2013, 7iber.com was blocked by the Jordanian government during a crackdown on online media. The block came after a public debate over the Press and Publication Law where Fayez Shawabkeh, the director of the government’s Press and Publication Department, was asked why the website was not blocked previously. Shawabkeh said, “If I find it's a news website, I will block it,” and later added, “if it's a blog, the law does not apply to it.\\" The Jordanian government determined that 7iber is a news website rather than a blog, and blocked access to the site until 7iber registers as a news agency. 7iber’s administration says they were informed of the ban only through a memo sent by the Press and Publication Department to the Telecom Regulatory Commission. “If the Press and Publication Department decided that 7iber.com needs a license, which is against all their public statements about blogs, they are supposed to officially inform us of this decision and give us 90 days before blocking the website,” 7iber added in an official statement. They also said that the law in question is a tool used to arbitrarily stifle freedom of expression. In order to register as a news agency, 7iber would have to have an editor in chief that has been a member of the Jordan Press Association (JPA) for at least 4 years, but membership in the JPA is not given to journalists who work in online media. 7iber was blocked again in August 2014.

The character is used as a symbol for the \\"Love Invasion,\\" a movement that aims to share love and kindness globally. He invented the idea for the campaign and character after moving to Toronto and noting the uninspired actions of city subway passengers and realizing he personally felt that people needed to express more compassion. Del Degan chose to add the heart to the robot's design to signify that people of the city have ability to love and be kind to one another. He decided to use concrete as the Lovebot's artistic medium, which he felt referenced Toronto’s urban architecture and history. The campaign was initially created as a street sticker art campaign but Del Degan and his team eventually chose to also create more than 100, 2 foot concrete statues, each weighing 200 pounds which they placed throughout Toronto. Each robot sculpture was made by hand in his backyard with over 30 volunteers. Each robot is now dedicated to a person who has made a difference in some way and is intended to inspire others into performing additional acts of kindness. In 2013 the campaign took off with a great deal of press coverage, like the Toronto Star, MTV and The Grid (which gave Del Degan a Mensch Award for his work with the Lovebot character and named him one of fifty individuals that had \\"made Toronto a better place this year\\"). Lovebot is now a brand owned and operated by Matthew Del Degan. Together the company offers Lovebot merchandise and a toy design that was crowd funded through Kickstarter. In addition, the Lovebot continues to be a vital part of Del Degan's artistic practice in street art and design. Those volunteering for Lovebot continue to work together under the name \\"The Lovebot Leaders.\\" The group has doubled since its conception has plans for global outreach. The Lovebot Leaders also emphasize work with charitable initiatives while continuing to build and distribute Lovebot sculptures.http://lovebot.com/ References External links  Official creator website Category:Culture of Toronto ","title":"Lovebot"},{"id":"42412604","text":"UE 900 and UE 900S are noise-isolating ear phones manufactured and marketed by Logitech, under the Ultimate Ears brand. They are aimed at listeners who prefer neutral sound signature. They are rated as one of the best ear phones in its price range by CNET. The ear phones received overall highly positive reviews. However, they were described as offering method of fitting that might be uncomfortable to some listeners. The ear phones include four armature drivers - two for bass, one for midrange and one for treble. They come with variety of accessories that often accompany more expensive custom models.  Design and accessories  UE 900 looks like a pair of custom earphones and provides a good fit that seals off the ear canals. There are two cables that are being provided: one in blue color that houses microphone and three-button remote control for iPhones, and one in black color for audio only. Both are in length. It has four balanced armatures in each earpiece. According to George Gill of Los Angeles Post-Examiner the UE900 utilizes a type of transducer that was originally designed for use in hearing aids and has been adapted for use in earphones.\\"http://lapostexaminer.com/ultimate-ears-ue900-hi-end-audio- everyone/2014/01/09  Reception  UE 900 received an \\"Excellent\\" rating from Tim Gideon of PC Magazine who noted: \\"The UE 900 sounds excellent overall, with a robust bass response and slightly boosted highs to match.\\" Steve Guttenberg from CNET commented that UE 900 is using separate bass, midrange and treble balanced armature drivers and is the best-sounding universal fit earphone in this price range. Matthew Miller reviewed the UE 900 for ZDNet in an article named \\"You will swear you are listening to new music with the Logitech UE 900 earphones.\\" In the summary of his review he wrote: \\"My favorite pair until now has been the UE Super.fi 5 Pro, but Logitech UE did it even better with the new UE 900s.\\" Meta review site Engadget wrote about the headset: \\"The UE 900s offer sound quality and a fit that comes close to what you'll get from UE's custom-fit in-ear models, with 9 sets of tips to fit just about any ears.\\" However they noted that it is a relatively expensive product. Michael Calore of Wired in an article \\"Ear Medicine\\" summarized his opinion about UE 900 as following: \\"The new flagship audiophile earphones from Ultimate Ears are just as awesome and perfect and beautiful-sounding as you’d expect from a $400 headset.\\" He noted, that stunning audio quality may justify the high cost. However, he somewhat disliked the fit that he called \\"intrusive\\", commenting that it might not be for everyone. BT Travel, a mainstream magazine for Business Traveling, noted that the noise isolation was very good during the test on a flight, however in his opinion it can also be a problem if someone would like to start a conversation with the listener.http://www.btmagazine.nl/logitech-ue-900-noise-isolating-earphones/ IT News Africa's staff writer wrote that the sound \\"is delivered cleanly\\".http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2012/08/logitech-launches-ue-900-noise- isolating-earphones/ Mixmag, a British electronic dance and clubbing magazine, wrote about UE 900: \\"Logitech UE have released one of their most hi-def earphones ever.\\"http://www.mixmag.net/tech/tech-news/logitech-ue-900 PC Magazine wrote, that assigning armatures to different frequencies allows for more detail in each specific range, so that deep lows and crisp highs get their own driver. The lows are subtly lifted, \\"which allows instrumental and classical pieces, like John Adams' \\"The Chairman Dances,\\" to retain a natural sound.\\" Wired was impressed by the audio quality and commented that UE 900s produce \\"some truly glorious sound, supremely rich from one end of the audio spectrum to the other. The bass is heavy and direct. Mid-range frequencies are perfectly represented, and the chiming highs are only slightly tempered at the very, very top end.\\" The reviewer also noted an excellent clarity and ability to hear details he had never picked up on before. ZDNET characterized the sound as clean, crisp, and authentic. The reviewer also noted that it seemed like he was in the recording studio with the bands and he has not heard sound this good before. While using UE900s with Beats Audio, that is introduced in a number of HTC smartphones, he noted a significant improvement in the music he was listening to. Stereophile's writer Ariel Bitran related his opinion about the sound: \\"The earphones propelled the beat with confidence, discipline, punctuation, and control, accenting the chunkiness of the groove without being edgy.\\" In his opinion the treble was chunky, resulting in a very non-fatiguing experience. Cymbals were somewhat grainy, while the midrange was ultra-clean. He could carefully discern instruments and follow them. Bass extended deep and he could hear normally inaudible or subdued whole-note bass synths in the chorus as warm and full-bodied for their entire duration. However, some highly compressed recordings such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers sounded \\"boxed\\". He also noted: \\"Most importantly, the sound is realistic, controlled and involving. Instruments are rich with tone. Attacks are carefully restrained, but the high end is still involving with its texture. Music is presented cleanly in front of the listener.\\" Witchdoctor, a New Zealand's Web magazine, wrote: \\"The 900’s are able to walk the fine line between being very revealing and being too clinical.\\"http://www.witchdoctor.co.nz/index.php/2013/01/logitech- ue-900-earphones-review/  See also  Ultimate Ears  References  Category:Products introduced in 2014 ","title":"UE 900"},{"id":"42412648","text":"Bringrr is a startup company that develops and manufactures electronic tracking systems for commonly used items, including smartphones.

He played for the Oakland Athletics from 2016 to 2017, and has played for the Rays since 2018.  Early life  Wendle was born in Wilmington, Delaware on April 26, 1990. He attended Avon Grove High School in West Grove, Pennsylvania, and West Chester University. Wendle played travel baseball for the Chester County Crawdads. Wendle was a four-year starter for the West Chester Golden Rams baseball team, where he compiled a .366 career batting average with 23 home runs and 185 runs batted in (RBIs). During his senior season, Wendle hit .399 with 12 home runs and 59 RBI as the Golden Rams went on to win the 2012 NCAA Division II Baseball Tournament. Professional career =Minor Leagues= The Cleveland Indians selected Wendle in the sixth round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft. He made his professional debut with the Mahoning Valley Scrappers of the Class A-Short Season New York- Penn League. In 61 games he hit .327/.375/.469 with four home runs and 37 (RBIs).

He won the Lou Boudreau Award as the Indians minor league player of the year. He started the 2014 season with the Akron RubberDucks of the Class AA Eastern League. = Oakland Athletics = On December 8, 2014, the Indians traded Wendle to the Oakland Athletics for Brandon Moss. On April 21, 2015, Wendle (as a member of Oakland's Triple-A affiliate, the Nashville Sounds) hit the first home run in the history of First Tennessee Park. The Athletics added him to their 40-man roster after the season. Oakland Athletics in 2017 Wendle began the 2016 season with Nashville. The Athletics promoted Wendle to the major leagues on August 31, 2016. He made his major league debut that day. Over the next season and a half, Wendle would appear in 36 games for the Athletics, collecting 29 hits in 109 at bats. Following the conclusion of the 2017 season, Wendle was designated for assignment on December 7, 2017. = Tampa Bay Rays = On December 11, 2017, the Athletics traded Wendle to the Tampa Bay Rays for Jonah Heim. Wendle entered spring training in 2018 competing for the starting second baseman job with Micah Johnson and Daniel Robertson. After hitting .327 in 52 spring training at bats, Rays manager Kevin Cash announced that Wendle had made the team's Opening Day roster to platoon at second base with Daniel Robertson. Wendle ended the season leading all rookies in wins above replacement (4.3), batting average (.300), on-base percentage (.350), and triples (6), as well as placing second in hits (146), doubles (33), and runs (62). Wendle was the first Rays player since 2011 to hit .300, and the first rookie to ever reach that mark. He tied for the major league lead in sacrifice flies (10). At the conclusion of the season, Wendle was unanimously chosen as the Rays Outstanding Rookie award for the 2018 season and finished fourth in the American League Rookie of the Year award.

For the season, Wendle hit .286 with 4 home runs and 17 RBI as the Rays clinched their first division title in ten years. In the ALDS against the Yankees, Wendle hit .353 as the Rays beat the Yankees in 5 games. Against the Houston Astros in the ALCS, Wendle made attention for his stellar defense at third base.

Feminist metaphysics overlaps with fields such as the philosophy of mind and philosophy of self. Feminist metaphysicians such as Sally Haslanger, Ásta, and Judith Butler have sought to explain the nature of gender in the interest of advancing feminist goals. Philosophers such as Robin Dembroff and Talia Mae Bettcher have sought to explain the genders of transgender and non-binary people.  Social construction  Simone de Beauvoir was the first feminist theorist to distinguish sex from gender, as is suggested by her famous line, “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.” In her seminal work The Second Sex, de Beauvoir argues that, although biological features distinguish men and women, these features neither cause nor justify the social conditions which disadvantage women. Since de Beauvoir, many feminists have argued that constructed categories re-enforce social hierarchies because they appear to be natural. Later theorists such as Judith Butler would challenge de Beauvoir's commitment to the pre-social existence of sex, arguing that sex is socially constructed as well as gender. Feminist metaphysics has thus challenged the apparent naturalness of both sex and gender. Another aim of feminist metaphysics has been to provide a basis for feminist activism by explaining what unites women as a group. These accounts have historically centered on cisgender women, but more recent accounts have sought to include transgender women as well. Robin Dembroff has introduced a metaphysical account of non- binary genders. References  Further reading  * Battersby, Christine.

History The barracks, which were originally established as the command depot i.e. convalescent camp for Northern Command, opened in April 1915 during the First World War. Wilfred Owen wrote many of his poems when based at the barracks, known at the time as Ripon Army Camp, in spring 1918. At the start of the Second World War, the School of Military Engineering, which had been based in Chatham, was split into two training Battalions, one of which re-located to the barracks. The barracks were renamed Harper Barracks, after Lieutenant-General Sir George Harper, a famous engineer general. The site was identified as a home for the School of Bomb Disposal, formed in 1941, reflecting the nomination of the Royal Engineers as being responsible for the discipline. Both the School of Military Engineering and the School of Bomb Disposal returned to Chatham in 1949. During the 1950s Harper Barracks was the home of a Royal Signals training regiment. In 1959 the barracks became the home of 38 Engineer Regiment who would remain there for nearly half a century. They were rebuilt and renamed Claro Barracks, after Claro Hill - a local beauty spot, in the 1960s. In 1974 a bomb attack by the Provisional Irish Republican Army badly damaged the barracks. The barracks went on to become the home of 21 Engineer Regiment in 2008.  Based units  The following notable units are based at Claro Barracks. = British Army = Corps of Royal Engineers * 21 Engineer Regiment  Future  The Ministry of Defence announced in March 2013 that the site had been earmarked for closure. In November 2016 the Ministry of Defence announced that the site would close in 2019. This was later extended to 2023. 21 Engineer Regiment are due to move to Marne Barracks at Catterick by 2023, and the site of Claro Barracks is due to sold off for housing. Plans were lodged with Harrogate Borough Council for an \\"urban village\\" development of 1,300 homes. If approved, work would start in 2022 and take 13 years to accomplish.

During the agency's existence its members examined over 52,000 films, over 2,000 of which required edits before approval was given; and another 157 films were rejected entirely, of which only 38 won subsequent approval. The board disbanded in 1968 following a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulings which overturned censorship statutes across the country.  Background and formation  The first ordinance for censorship of motion pictures in the United States was enacted by the city of Chicago in 1907. As many as 100 other metropolitan areas adopted censorship statutes; state governments began to follow suit and in 1922 Virginia became the last of seven states to create its own censorship board, becoming one of the leaders in film censorship in the country. The Virginia General Assembly approved an act on March 15, 1922 \\"to regulate motion picture films and reels; providing a system of examination, approval and regulation thereof, and of the banners, poster and other like advertising matter used in connection therewith; creating the board of censors; and providing penalties for the violation of this act.\\" Through issuing licenses to filmmakers and distributors, the board sought to limit films the members felt threatened \\"morality\\" or films that may cause the \\"incitement of a crime;\\" these films often involved depictions of sexual situations and/or race relations. Virginia's statutes were copied verbatim from those of New York's censorship board, but Virginia followed a slightly different mandate not written in the legislation, focusing on racial sensibilities in Virginia. = Board Members = The Act's second provision detailed the guidelines under which the board's members were selected. The board would be composed of three residents of Virginia \\"well qualified by education and experience to act as censors under this act,\\" whom would be appointed by the governor. Governor Elbert Lee Trinkle appointed the first members of the Board of Censors: Evan Chesterman, a writer and former secretary of the Board of Education; R.C.L. Moncure, a tax collector and former businessman; and Emma Speed Sampson, a Richmond native artist and writer. In an interview with The Monocle in 1929, Sampson stated: \\"We only eliminate vulgarities in comic pictures. In fact, we do not cut much from pictures because now the people are broader-minded and every day pictures getting better.\\" This original board would later be abolished then reinstated under the department of law, supervised by the attorney general, but censors remained governor appointed. Positions in censorship boards anywhere in the country became valuable patronage plums awarded by the state's respective governor, and board members often were people with little or no experience in the film industry. Censorship board positions were often held by politically connected women, and no censor appointed in Virginia ever retired from the position, although board members would occasionally step down and be replaced over time. When reviewing films that were particularly controversial, the board sometimes brought in other members of the community to help pass judgment, such public health officials or lawyers.  Censorship criteria  The Board of Censors reviewed three types of films specified in the fifth provision as: Used films (films screened in Virginia prior to the board's formation), \\"Current event\\" films (any new narrative film depicting current events), and scientific and educational films. The legislation also required any film to be licensed by the board before being publicly screened, and board certification had to be displayed on screen sometime during its exhibition. The state's legislators believed that sexuality portrayed in films was a potentially dangerous force that threatened racial traditions, economic stability, and the marital bond. As a result, the board focused on the issues of 'morality' and the 'incitement of crime' as criteria for rejecting films and devoted considerable attention to censoring what they considered immoral films; films that typically portrayed sexuality. Films that portrayed interracial socializing, be it sexual or not, and any film that showed interracial tensions of any kind also received considerable criticism from the Board of Censors. The passage of the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 gave the board their justification in censoring depictions of racial mixing. Members of the Board of Censors followed a mandate which, as stated in an annual report, \\"scrutinized with particular care all films which touch upon the relations existing between whites and blacks. Every scene or subtitle calculated to produce friction between the races is eliminated.\\" Although the board did not explicitly define what material might \\"produce friction between the races,\\" any film that did not depict segregation to the satisfaction of the board would be subject to major cuts, or rejection \\"in toto.\\"  Controversies  In most cases of disapproval, the Board of Censors would request certain sections of film prints be cut before license was granted, but these edits often created critical errors in the films in question, such as causing gaps in the story line, miss-matched shots, and problems with synchronization of sound and image in the early days of talkies. Other times the board outright banned entire films from screening regardless of any edits that could be made. In the face of the Racial Integrity Act and a film censorship board, Virginia became a leader in the South for its enhanced progressive image. Virginia and its leading citizens perpetuated a reputation of having friendlier relations than most states in the South, but the state's relations relied upon rigid racial and social control set forth by the dominant white middle and upper classes. The board's efforts were aimed at protecting the lower class from immoral material, but the freedom of speech for all Virginians was at risk because with a film censorship board the state now had the power to regulate the cultural consumption of middle and upper class standards. By policing the boundaries of gender and sexuality, the board, in effect, also policed the boundaries of class. = Oscar Micheaux = One filmmaker who constantly pushed the limits of Virginia's Board of Censers was Oscar Micheaux. Micheaux was one of several black filmmakers between the 1910s and 1950s who sought to provide black audiences with films made from a black perspective, and he is considered the foremost African American filmmaker of the era. Oscar Micheaux The Virginia Board of Censors would specifically make sure only stereotypical African American images, such as maids, butlers, and criminals would be portrayed in movies. However, Micheaux's intention with his films was to accurately depict the conditions in which black men lived in the United States. Throughout Micheaux's career the board consistently voiced their distaste for his films. Evan Chesterman wrote in a 1925 report that Micheaux's production company was, \\"a negro corporation, whose output is designed solely for colored houses, and whose actors, almost without exception, are colored people, has been severely disciplined on account of its infelicitous, not to say dangerous, treatment of the race question.\\" The board's response to Micheaux's films provides a glimpse of their larger administrative agenda of managing race relations under a code of white paternalism and a strict racial etiquette. Micheaux and the Virginia Board of Censors first came at odds over his 1924 film, Birthright. The film first screened in Virginia even though Micheaux never gained approval from the board. Chesterman investigated how this could happen and it turns out Birthright had been screening with a Virginia Board of Censors seal of approval, and he concluded Micheaux must have committed a \\"deliberate violation of the censorship act\\" by editing in the seal from a previously approved film. Micheaux never responded to letters from the board, and in response the board fined Micheaux and never reviewed Birthright nor allowed its screening in the state. In July 1924, Micheaux did submit his film, A Son of Satan, to the Virginia Board of Censors for review, which was subsequently rejected. When the filmmaker requested an appeal, the board denied his request citing the way Micheaux failed to respond to the objections of Birthright earlier in the year. The board's specific objections to A Son of Satan stemmed from images of miscegenation and race riots, as well as scenes which caused \\"blurring of racial lines in public spaces such as dance halls.\\" After paying a fine, making some cuts, and a great deal of confrontation with the members of the board, namely Chesterman, Micheaux's film was eventually licensed to be shown in Virginia. In March 1927, Micheaux's newest film, The House Behind the Cedars, generated controversy among the Board of Censors just as the filmmaker's previous two efforts had, however their ruling on this film sparked debate on the white allegiance to the Racial Integrity Act. The board's report concluded films were not the proper medium for handling sensitive topics involving race, and that The House Behind the Cedars had the potential to incite crime through race riots. Micheaux objected saying the film had been adapted from a book, which had been in circulation for thirty years, and the film had screened across the country without incident. Micheaux once again agreed to make cuts to his film, and the board licensed The House behind the Cedars, but Micheaux only screened the film in Virginia's black theaters. = The Birth of a Baby = In addition to censoring sexual situations in drama films, the Board of Censors also censored documentary films. Educational films such The Miracle of Life and Girls of the Underworld depicted stories of contraception and the consequences of venereal disease, respectively, and they were both rejected \\"in toto\\" by the board for their dramatic portrayals of what were considered sexual taboos. In 1937 Virginia, along with several other states, banned The Birth of a Baby, an educational film sponsored by the American Medical Association and the U.S. Public Health Service, among many other organizations, and looked to educate parents about safe child birth. Virginia's rejection of this film led to the first challenge against a censorship ordinance in the state, which was decided in the Virginia Supreme Court case Lynchburg v. Dominion Theatres of 1940, leading to a rare occurrence of a censorship ordinance being overturned during the time the Board of Censors existed. This would be the last successful overruling of a censorship ordinance until 1965, however the debate over censorship versus the legality of prior restraint began to gain momentum.  Board disbands  In 1952 the U.S. Supreme Court placed movies under First Amendment protection in the ruling of Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, reversing a decision that stood since 1915 and thus overturning any film censorship case to come after. However, some states raised the debate whether censorship was a question of prior restraint, or free speech, and some boards carried on censoring while working through the appeals process. By 1956, Virginia was one of only four states still with censorship boards. After a lengthy legal battle, New York's ban of the film Lady Chatterley's Lover was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1957, a decision that greatly impacted New York's censorship laws as well those remaining in the other three states, Virginia included. The U.S. Supreme Court case Freedman v. Maryland in 1965 officially overturned the censorship statutes of the remaining censorship boards in the country, and Virginia's State Board of Censors became inactive effective June 30, 1966.

She founded the Liceo Fanning (1881), a women's college, where she implemented her educational approaches. She was the widow of Juan Fanning, a Peruvian war hero who perished during the Battle of Miraflores in the War of the Pacific. Although a somewhat forgotten figure, she is deemed as the precursor to the integral education of women, with practical connotations (including labor formation) as a form of attaining liberation from the patriarchy. This is notable because, at the time, Peruvian society still considered that female education should only be aimed at improving their role as housewives. A collection of her articles, which had been published in El Comercio, were compiled in a booklet entitled Female Education (1898). It was highly critical about women's education, which till then, was exclusively geared to prepare for marriage and motherhood. Gonzalez rejected this type of curriculum, promoting in its place the study of music, writing and mathematics as broader preparation with a practical connotation. She favored job training which would provide a source of income, allowing women to emancipate themselves from dependence on a husband. At lower levels, she suggested a more practical life skills education to learn a trade. On another level, she described a more enlightened education, within scientific and philosophical disciplines. Her views were recognized as a precursor to modern educational programs for women.

She is originally from Boston and now works out of Los Angeles. Much of her work is sculptural and installation- based, incorporating found objects and materials. Her work deals with institutional critique, collecting practices, antiquity, monument-building, and the concept of material value. Many of her installations encourage public engagement and participatory performance among her audiences. She is represented by Paula Cooper Gallery in New York.Liz Glynn On the Possibility of Salvage Early life and education Glynn was born in Boston, Massachusetts. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual and Environmental Studies at Harvard College in 2003 and a Masters of Fine Arts from the California Institute of the Arts in 2008. Work =Sculptural work= Glynn is known for replicating objects of antiquity with histories that she has researched extensively using minimal materials and in a somewhat primitive manner. The works are not about perfect replication or recreating an object with equivalent material value; instead she is more interested in the subjective and historical contexts that imbue the originals with their collective—and in some ways, arbitrary—worth. In an interview with Machine Project she states, \\"...for me, the proposition is not only that you could make a bad copy, but that you can make the copy however you would like to make it. So in a sense you can literally re-materialize your own history.\\" Her first solo project RANSOM ROOM took place June 2 - July 28, 2014 in SculptureCenter with an opening reception on Sunday June 1, 5 - 7 pm.Liz Glynn: RANSOM ROOM =Installations= Similar to her sculptural work, Glynn's installations are composed of found and inexpensive materials and often index elements of political history, such as her installations that appear as public monuments. The underlying purpose of the installations is to engage her audiences both with the physical structure and with each other, providing a platform for social interaction. She has said of her installations, \\"Each of these projects reconstructs an epic narrative with 'poor' materials, and allows the audience to navigate through the space and situation through their own lived experience and conversations with fellow participants.\\" An example of her performative installations includes Black Box a speakeasy and official after-hours location for the Getty's Pacific Standard Time initiative. For 11 days, participants engaged in her licensed temporary bar in a vacant warehouse in West Hollywood. Similarly, her installation and pallet pyramid III invited audience participants to nine curated parties and performances that were decorated by Glynn's aesthetic of reconstructed antiquity. Awards Liz Glynn is the recipient of several awards including the Center for Cultural Innovation's Grant (2012), California Community Foundation Emerging Artist Fellowship (2010), and the Joan Mitchell Foundation Associate Artist Fellowship (2007).

His work often explored the meaning of cultural diversity and sought to expand awareness of multicultural issues in the arts. Life Villa was born in San Francisco, California, to immigrant parents in the Tenderloin District. He was introduced to art when taking lessons with his cousin, Leo Valledor, who taught him to study etchings by Matisse. Villa started to display his work in 1958 and went on to receive a B.F.A. in Education in 1961 from the San Francisco Art Institute, and a subsequent M.F.A. in Painting in 1963 from Mills College. Villa died March 23, 2013 in San Francisco from cancer and is survived by his wife, Mary Valledor, daughter Sydney and stepson Rio Valledor. Career Villa created multimedia projects and performances that he called \\"Actions\\"; these were often group collaborations which dealt with multicultural topics. In 1976, Villa curated a multidisciplinary, multiethnic exhibition entitled Other Sources: An American Essay, that showcased work by Bay Area artists of color. This exhibition was an alternative celebration of the United States Bicentennial, and focused on people of color and women. It showcased artists including Ruth Asawa, Bernice Bing, Rolando Castellon, Claude Clark, Robert Colescott, Frank Day, Rupert Garcia, Mike Henderson, Oliver Jackson, Frank LaPena, Linda Lomahaftewa, George Longfish, Ralph Maradiaga, José Montoya, Manuel Neri, Mary Lovelace O’Neil, Darryl Sapien, Raymond Saunders, James Suzuki, Horace Washington, Al Wong, René Yañez, Leo Valledor. Live performances by Winston and Mary Tong, Mark Izu and Ray Robles, poetry readings by Janice Mirikitani, Jessica Hagedorn, and Al Robles and numerous others. In 1995, Villa published Worlds in Collision, a book on multiculturalism in the arts. The contents were transcriptions of presentations and discussions held during the San Francisco Art Institute’s symposia series entitled Sources of a Distinct Majority (1989-1991). The Worlds In Collision project continued in subsequent symposia, web projects and courses until 2013. In 2010, Villa organized Rehistoricizing Abstract Expressionism in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1950s-1960s, a web project, symposium and exhibition at The Luggage Store Gallery that focused attention on contributions by women and artists of color (primarily abstract expressionist painters) that were overlooked by art history. In 2011, Villa had a solo retrospective of his work entitled Manongs, Some Doors and a Bouquet of Crates at the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts in San Francisco.

Since their birth in early 2012, they have written and recorded two EP's with producer Jordan Schmidt (All Time Low, Motion City Soundtrack, Sing It Loud). The band has created a following by promoting themselves at concerts across the entire country, as well as gaining a following by having multiple songs on MTV's reality television shows. History Forming in early 2012, The Role Call was created by friends who had known each other from the local music scene in Minneapolis, Minnesota. They wrote and recorded their first EP with producers Jordan Schmidt (All Time Low, Motion City Soundtrack, Sing It Loud) and Pat Brown (Sing It Loud).

After this tour, The Role Call continued building their fan base by following tours promoting. In addition to this, they started to release cover videos on YouTube including Owl City/Carly Rae Jepsen's song \\"Good Time\\". This cover has reached nearly 400,000 views since it has been released. After spending months out on the road touring, promoting and traveling thousands of miles, The Role Call went to Nashville, Tennessee to record their new EP with Jordan Schmidt (All Time Low, Motion City Soundtrack, Sing It Loud) again.

Political career From 1920 to 1924 Katharina von Oheimb was one of the 36 women amongst the 466 representatives of the 1. Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. Despite being a member of the national liberal German People's Party she tended toward socialist beliefs. Until 1931, she was entitled as the secretary of the Pro Palestine Committee. During the Weimar Republic, she hosted one of the most significant political salons in Berlin. Bankers and industrialists, ministers, military personnel, and artists socialized at her house at Kurfürstendamm (1919-1926) and later in her new apartment at Matthäikirchstreet 32. Her social and political engagement comprised a variety of activities and appointments, for instance her board membership of the East Prussia Relief. She took custodianship of illegitimate children and supported orphans. She was a friend of campaigner for women's rights Minna von Caurer, with whom she founded the \\"Bund for Mutterschutz\\" (League for Maternity Protection) together with sex educator Helene Stöcker. In 1922, she started educational courses for women hoping to prepare them for their rather new suffrage and opportunities to run for political office. Amongst the invited speakers were Gustav Stresemann and Clara Mende. As a result of her visibility in society and her turbulent private life, journalist and author Kurt Tucholsky addressed her in his derogative toned poem \\"An Frau von Oheimb\\" in 1930. Personal life Katharina von Oheimb was the daughter of the furniture and silk goods manufacturer Rudolf van Endert. After his death in 1881, her mother Elisabeth continued the proceedings. Katharina's brothers–Josef and Rudolf–later entered the business. Katharina von Oheimb was married four times. At age 19, she married the industrialist Felix Daelen who founded the \\"Glyco-Metallwerke\\". They had three children together, however, the fourth child Paul-Felix, born in the time of their marriage, was fathered by her second husband. Nevertheless, Paul-Felix later became director of Glyco factory. She and her husband divorced in 1905, after Katharina had left the family. Her second husband, Ernst Albert, was the son of industrialist Heinrich Albert. Their daughter Elisabeth's second husband was conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler making Katharina von Oheimb the grandmother of actress Kathrin Ackermann and great-grandmother of actress Maria Furtwängler. Albert died in 1911, after a mountaineering accident in Tyrol. Katharina continued the business of his ceramic factory and married Albert's best friend, and owner of a manor, Hans Joachim von Oheimb. They divorced in 1921. In 1927, she married her former parliamentary colleague Siegfried von Kardoff, who ran for second vice president of the Reichstag.

With over a quarter of Wales's land area, covering much of the eastern half of the country, it is a county of remote uplands, low population and no coastline. It was created in more or less its current form in 1974, and is the only one of the large county units created at that time to have been carried forward intact at the 1996 local government re-organisation. It comprises three historic counties, namely Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, and most of Brecknockshire. There are 950 scheduled monuments within the county. This is far more than can be sensibly covered in one list, so each of the 3 historic counties is therefore listed separately, and each of these has two lists - one for the prehistoric sites and one for the Roman, medieval and post-medieval sites. Statistics The statistics below show the total number of sites ascribed to each period, and the breakdown for the six lists of scheduled monuments in Powys. The allocation to one or another period is not always certain, particularly between the prehistoric periods, and many sites will have remains from more than one period, so the statistics below give a general guide only. { class=\\" wikitable plainrowheaders\\" border=\\"1\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"  !scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"Prehistoric !scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Roman to Modern !scope=\\"col\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Link to Lists !scope=\\"col\\" Neolithic !scope=\\"col\\" Bronze Age !scope=\\"col\\" Iron Age !scope=\\"col\\" Roman !scope=\\"col\\" Early medieval !scope=\\"col\\" Medieval !scope=\\"col\\" post- medieval !scope=\\"col\\" Total - !scope=\\"row\\"Prehistoric Montgomeryshire 211621139 - !scope=\\"row\\"Roman to modern Montgomeryshire 1414829119 - !scope=\\"row\\"Prehistoric Radnorshire 111772190 - !scope=\\"row\\"Roman to modern Radnorshire 1625629112 - !scope=\\"row\\"Prehistoric Brecknockshire 1219052254 - !scope=\\"row\\"Roman to modern Brecknockshire 1097839136 - !scope=\\"row\\"Totals  bgcolor=\\"#F0F0F0\\"15 bgcolor=\\"#F0F0F0\\"423 bgcolor=\\"#F0F0F0\\"145 bgcolor=\\"#F0F0F0\\"40 bgcolor=\\"#F0F0F0\\"48 bgcolor=\\"#F0F0F0\\"222 bgcolor=\\"#F0F0F0\\"57 bgcolor=\\"#F0F0F0\\"950 } Statutory protection Scheduled monuments have statutory protection.

Walberg, which aired on the USA Network from June 17, 1996 to September 19, 1997. Notably, the series featured a young Jon Hamm as a contestant on one episode. Susan Powter and Hank Steinberg also appeared as participants. Round 1 One bachelor/bachelorette chose one of three members of the opposite sex to try & hook up with. Host Walberg asked up to three questions to the potential couple, all of which have two choices marked \\"A\\" or \\"B\\". They made their choice individually by pressing a button corresponding to one of those letters (in earlier episodes, there were hands marked with those letters). The objective was to match their answers, and it took two matches to become a couple. If the possible couple mis-matched twice, they sat back at their own chairs. Along the way (after one match), one player could stay with the current possible mate, trade one possible mate for another, or can choose to take the \\"mystery man\\"/\\"mystery woman\\" (whoever was behind a door on either side of the set). Sometimes when choosing the door, out would come Bert Dinkel (in case of the guy, he became Fern Dinkel); if that happened, that player was out of the game and another player stepped in. As soon as two players made the two matches, they became a couple and they moved on to round two. As soon as two couples were formed, that is when round two began. Round 2 (Me or Not Me) The two formed couples played the next round to see who's more compatible than the other. Host Walberg read a series of statements in which the answers were always either \\"Me\\" or \\"Not Me\\". A typical question would go like this: \\"Me or Not Me, I've eaten a bug.\\" or like this \\"Me or Not Me, I never got along with my parents.\\" Like in the first round, the idea was to match answers with each other and the couple with the most matches won the game and advanced to the bonus round. Bonus Round In the bonus round, host Walberg read true/false questions to the winning couple and each correct answer won $50. The bonus went through two different formats in its year-plus- long run. =Format 1= In the first format, Mark read six true/false statements about the mates and their behaviors (three for each mate), the mates themselves replied to those questions before the show. Now it is up to the partner to guess if the statement is either true or false. After the partner gave his/her answer, the mate whom the question was about announced the answer he/she gave beforehand. A correct match earned the couple $50 and matching on four questions invited the couple back on Friday's show for a trip to Jamaica. =Friday Jamaica Drawing= On Friday shows, the couples who made the required four matches were entered in a drawing. Their names were put into a hat and whoever couple's names were drawn first won the Jamaican vacation. =Format 2= In this bonus format, host Walberg gave statements about dating. Some were real facts, some were from opinion polls, others were just made up. On each statement, the couple decided whether the statement was either true or false. Each correct answer was worth $50 and if the couple got six right in 60 seconds or less they won $300 and a trip.

A large rockshelter located near the Jackson River, it has been occupied by humans for thousands of years, and it has been named a historic site. Geography Hidden Valley is a tall formation with a nearly vertical rear wall; trees grow below the roof at the shelter's edge. The stone is Oriskany sandstone, located in an outcrop near the western side of the Jackson River, but it is generally safe from flooding due to its location approximately higher than the river's normal surface. Measuring approximately from end to end, and from the drip line to the base of the rear wall, the shelter is irregular in its shape; vertical striations and deep holes are found on the rear wall.Loth, Calder, ed. The Virginia Landmarks Register. 4th ed. Charlottesville and London: U of Virginia P, 1999, 58. Human presence Hidden Valley is known to have been occupied for the last several thousand years. The site's good stratigraphy has enabled archaeologists to demonstrate its occupation since the Late Archaic, three millennia before Christ, while Late Woodland cultural materials are also present. It remained in use into the historic period, as evidence of interactions between Indians and whites is likewise present.Grumet, Robert Steven. Historic Contact: Indian People and Colonists in Today's Northeastern United States in the Sixteenth Through Eighteenth Centuries. Norman: U of Oklahoma P, 1995, 297. However, the site's significance depends on the wide variety of cultural materials dating between these extremes: simple artifacts such as common projectile points and potsherds are found at all locations in the midden, and the continuity of the deposits demonstrates gradual transitions in ceramic and lithic technology from generation to generation of the shelter's occupants. Moreover, the shelter is significant for more than just its pottery and stone tools: both faunal and floral materials are exceptionally well preserved at Hidden Valley, thus enabling scholars to trace the site's environment over the last several thousand years. Human remains have also been found at the site: one human burial, an infant less than a year old, was found with a pair of canine skulls, and the bones of another dog were found mixed with those of an adolescent human. The appearance of canine skeletons may be an indication of the shelter's ritual significance, as ritual burials of dogs are known from numerous Archaic sites;Claassen, Cheryl, and Mary Elizabeth Compton. \\"Rock Features of Western North Carolina\\". The Archaeology of North Carolina: Three Archaeological Symposia, ch. 14. N.p.: North Carolina Archaeological Council, 2011, 14-3. one such site, the Carlston Annis Shell Mound in western Kentucky, produced the remains of nearly thirty intentionally buried dogs.Webb, William S. \\"The Carlson Annis Mound: Site 5 Butler County Kentucky\\". University of Kentucky Reports in Anthropology 7.4 (1950): 265-354: 272. Scholar Cheryl Claassen argues that dog-burial sites were considered places of renewal, a belief that persisted into the historic Cherokee. Preservation In mid-1986, the Hidden Valley Rockshelter was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological significance. It is one of twenty-one Bath County locations with this distinction, although none of the others are significant primarily on archaeological grounds.

Walter Ruben, based on a story by Pauline Forney and Dudley Murphy. It was moderately successful for RKO Pictures, and was released in both sound and silent versions. Plot A poor songwriter from the south, Barry Holmes, travels to New York City to be a success, bringing with him his prize possession: his piano. While he is trying to break into Tin Pan Alley, he stays at a boardinghouse run by Mrs. Langley, who insists that her house always be run with the highest propriety. A young woman, Ruth Morgan, lives in the room next to Holmes. One night, he annoys the entire boarding house as he is trying to complete a song he has been working on, \\"Someone\\". He is stuck on the ending, until he hears Ruth humming how she thinks it should go. Stunned, he goes to her room, and invites her back to his to finish the song. Unfortunately, Mrs. Langley discovers the two unmarried people in his room, and summarily kicks him out, intending to keep his piano as payment for back rent. Ruth works for a music publisher, Kemple and Klucke, and plots to get them to publish Holmes' song. Both of her bosses are interested in Ruth, although Kemple is quite a bit older than her. The two partners make a bet that the younger Klucke cannot take Ruth out to dinner. Ruth makes a deal with Kemple not to agree to the dinner, but changes her mind when Klucke agrees to listen to Holmes' song if she accompanies him. Mrs. Langley's husband, Max, has a soft spot for the young couple, and attempts to sneak Holmes' piano out of the rooming house. Unfortunately, in the attempt, the piano is dropped down a flight of stairs, and broken into pieces. Distraught, Ruth and Barry, don't know how they are going to finish the song in order to pitch it to Kemple and Klucke. To make up for the loss of the piano, Max sneaks them into a piano factory during the night, where they finalize the song. Unknown to them, the factory also has an open microphone to a radio station, and the song is actually broadcast over the air. The song is an instant hit, and a bidding war starts between Kemple and Klucke and Parker Pianos for the rights to the song. Holmes is a success, and, of course, ends up getting the girl.

Generally, NSL applies planar ordered arrays of nanometer-sized latex or silica spheres as lithography masks to fabricate nanoparticle arrays. NSL uses self-assembled monolayers of spheres (typically made of polystyrene, often available commercially as an aqueous suspension) as evaporation masks. These spheres can be deposited using multiple methods including Langmuir-Blodgett, Dip Coating, Spin Coating, solvent evaporation, force-assembly, and air-water interface.C. Zhang, et al. Fabricating Ordered 2-D Nano-Structured Arrays Using Nanosphere Lithography. MethodsX 4, 2017, pp. 229-242. DOI:10.1016/j.mex. open access This method has been used to fabricate arrays of various nanopatterns, including gold nanodots with precisely controlled spacings.  Nanosphere Monolayer Preparation  Monolayers of nanospheres, to be used as lithography masks can be created using multiple methods: Polystyrene nanoparticle coating done with the Langmuir-Blodgett method Langmuir-Blodgett is a deposition method in which the nanoparticles are placed in a Langmuir-Blodgett Trough floating on an aqueous solution, forming a monolayer. With the help of barriers and surface pressure sensor, the particles are compressed into the desired packing density automatically. The coating is done in this packing density with the help of a motorized dipper while the barriers maintain the desired particle packing density. The benefits of the Langmuir-Blodgett method include a strict control over the particle packing density and coating thickness (mono or multilayers can be created) as well as the ability to coat large homogeneous areas. Mask preparation with the Langmuir-Blodgett method has been demonstrated for example using SiO2 particles and polystyrene particles. Dip Coating is a simplified version of the Langmuir-Blodgett. In dip coating, the nanosphere packing density isn't controlled but the dipping is performed directly on a colloidal particle solution. Dip coating is an effective method for applications where a precise control over the particle distribution isn't required. Spin Coating and solvent evaporation methods are capable of producing large areas of particles, but with limited control over the layer homogeneity or thickness. Solvent evaporation is accomplished via drop coating, and is arguably the simplest method to produce a monolayer of nanospheres, as the spheres are simply dropped onto the substrate and allowed to dry, self-assembling into a monolayer. Sometimes the substrate is placed at an angle or moved in circular motions to help the suspension of spheres spread and wet the entire surface. Force-assembled monolayers are formed from a dry nanosphere powder, which can typically be obtained by centrifugation of a nanosphere suspension. The powder is then rubbed between two substrates to force them into a monolayer. The substrates are typically coated in a polymer such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to promote adhesion and spreading of the nanospheres. The air-water interface method relies on the formation of a monolayer of nanospheres on the surface of a water bath, at the air-water interface. In this method, the substrate is held below the surface of the water, and water is then pumped out to gradually lower the surface. Eventually, the water surface is lowered below the level of the substrates, and the monolayer at the air-water interface is deposited onto the substrate surface.

He was the mayor of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, from 1 January 2011 to 30 September 2013. His political projects focused on promoting education, improving the standards of living, and in bringing back a sense of public security to the citizens of the city. He also owned the newspapers Primera Hora and Última Hora. During his mayoral administration in Nuevo Laredo, Galván received numerous threats from organized crime. Five months after his term, he was kidnapped and killed by alleged members of the Los Zetas crime syndicate. Early life and career Benjamín Galván Gómez was born in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, on 10 June 1972. His parents were Benjamín Galván Maytonera and Martha Graciela Gómez. He was married to Martha Alicia Aldapa Campos and had three children. Galván graduated from the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas (UAT) in 1993 with a degree in Accounting, as well as from the Universidad Valle del Bravo with a degree in Law in 1997. As a businessman, Galván was the general-director and owner of the newspapers Primera Hora and Última Hora. He also taught as a professor at the UAT and served as president of the Cruz Roja and Casa del Migrante in Nuevo Laredo. In politics, Galván held the following positions: head of the Fiscal Office of Tamaulipas in Nuevo Laredo, director of Protección Civil y Bomberos, director and delegate of the Tamaulipas Department of Tourism, member of the Binational Committee of Tourism, and leader of Frente Juvenil. Mayoralty From 1 January 2011 to 30 September 2013, Galván served as the municipal president (mayor) of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, a border city on the U.S.-Mexico border. Sponsored by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Galván had won the mayoral election with 73% of the votes, succeeding former Nuevo Laredo mayor Ramón Garza Barrios (2008–2010). The PRI created a party coalition known as \\"Todos Tamaulipas\\" (All Tamaulipas) with the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico and the New Alliance Party. Galván won with 83,250 votes in favor, while the runner-up contender José Salvador Rosas Quintanilla of the National Action Party (PAN) received 22,330 votes. The other candidates that ran for office were Everardo Quiroz Torres of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, who received 3,917 votes; Angélica López Quiroz of the Labor Party, who received 1,138; and Jorge Alejandro García Amador of Convergence, who received 963. Galván's mayor pro tempore was Delfino Eduardo González Muñoz. During his administration Galván said his projects were based on three main pillars: bringing back tranquility to Neolaredenses (citizens of Nuevo Laredo); improving employment and the standard of living; and working to promote education. In his first annual government speech after a year in office, Galván talked about the administration's projects in security, financing, and public works. He stated that by the end of 2011, the Nuevo Laredo municipal government managed to reduce its debt by 600 million pesos (equivalent to US$45,826,200). In coordination with the state government and federal authorities, he emphasized the importance of Operation Security Tamaulipas for crime prevention in Nuevo Laredo. In his second annual speech, he talked about the projects carried out in his administration, recognizing that public debt and security were the biggest challenges and priorities in his term. In his third and final annual speech, Galván talked about the city's advances in infrastructure and other public works. City officials, including politicians from other parties and the mayor of Laredo, Texas, Raul G. Salinas, graded Galván's term as \\"Good\\". In his term Galván inaugurated the Dr. Rodolfo Torre Cantú Auditorium with a 5,000-seat capacity and the future home stadium of the Toros de Nuevo Laredo basketball team; the Unidad Deportiva Benito Juárez (Benito Juárez Sport Complex), the home stadium of the Bravos de Nuevo Laredo football club; Nuevo Laredo's first aquarium in Parque Viveros and its first amusement park with mechanical dinosaurs and other educational attractions at Park Narcisco Mendoza, as well as the reconstruction of other installations for social events. In the last year of his administration, however, the Superior Audit Office of Mexico, the audit office of the Mexican federal government, discovered two irregularities in the city's spending and budget. On 30 September 2013, at the end of his mayoral administration, Galván was succeeded by Carlos Enrique Canturosas Villarreal of the PAN. That year, the new mayor opened an investigation against eleven former city officials alleged to be involved in the financial case. On 8 November 2016, one of the city's former financial heads, Juan Fernando Miranda Macías, was arrested for illegally using city resources. He was released from prison in two days after a judge concluded that the accusations against him were inconclusive. =Threats from organized crime= During his tenure as mayor, Galván received death threats from organized crime. Nuevo Laredo has been the battleground among Mexico's drug trafficking organizations given its proximity to the U.S-Mexico border and Interstate 35, a lucrative route where most of the cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine that reaches the United States are smuggled through. In May 2012, alleged organized crime members left the headless corpses of 14 men inside a vehicle near the Nuevo Laredo city hall. Alongside the corpses was a written message reportedly from the Sinaloa Cartel that accused Galván and other city officials of working for Los Zetas (such accusations between gangsters and local officials are common in Mexico). In June 2012, a car bomb detonated outside the Nuevo Laredo city hall at Galván's parking area, injuring several bystanders. On February 2013, the Nuevo Laredo police chief Roberto Alejandro Balmori Garza was kidnapped and his two brothers were found dead. He had been appointed by Galván as head of the police in 2011 following the murder of Manuel Farfán Carriola, the former police chief of Nuevo Laredo. In an interview held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, aside from the violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated that it was a difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces step up to the job in the future. Kidnapping and death As Galván left a Farmacia Guadalajara drugstore near his home in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, on the evening of 27 February 2014, he was kidnapped along with businessman Miguel Ángel Ortiz. His vehicle was discovered abandoned with open doors in the pharmacy's parking lot by his wife. The following day, a disfigured corpse found in the trunk of a pickup truck in the town of García, Nuevo León, was taken to the hospital of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. After more than a month of forensic examination, experts officially identified the corpse as that of Galván on 31 March 2014. Post-mortem reports concluded that Galván had been tortured before being killed with a coup de grâce. The exact location of Galván's murder remains unknown, although authorities tend to believe he was most likely killed in Tamaulipas. On 11 March 2014, Mexican authorities arrested Carlos Pérez González, a former member of the Mexican Army Special Forces and ex-policeman from Nuevo León, for his involvement in Galván's murder. Pérez González confessed following his arrest, alleging that Los Zetas had recruited him. The police reported that unidentified gangsters ordered Pérez González and Oziel Enrique Medina Rangel (alias \\"El Trompas\\") to transport the former mayor's corpse through Nuevo León and into Coahuila state. But because of law enforcement surveillance on their planned route, they abandoned the truck with Galván's corpse in García, Nuevo León. For disobeying those orders, organized crime members killed \\"El Trompas\\" and dumped his body in Salinas Victoria. On 17 March 2014, José Isidro Cruz Villarreal (alias \\"El Pichilo\\") was arrested for his involvement in the murder. Investigators believe he was one of the men in charge of ordering Pérez González and \\"El Trompas\\" to transport the body to Coahuila. \\"El Pichilo\\", who had escaped from prison during the Apodaca prison riot in 2012, was arrested following information provided by Pérez González. On 12 April 2014, Pérez González was stabbed to death by unknown assailants in the restroom area at the Topo Chico prison in Monterrey. The kidnapping and murder of the former mayor came as a surprise to some law enforcement authorities given the fact that Galván was living a seemingly ordinary life as a citizen of Laredo–Nuevo Laredo border area. \\"He didn't have to worry about anything and then he gets kidnapped\\", said Webb County Sheriff Martin Cuellar. The authorities believe that the attack was perpetrated by Los Zetas, but the motives behind the incident remain unknown. =Funeral= Hundreds of people, including family members, friends, local citizens, and politicians, attended Galván's funeral at the Catholic Catedral del Espíritu Santo in Nuevo Laredo on 4 April 2014. Nuevo Laredo bishop Gustavo Rodríguez Vega and Laredo, Texas bishop James Anthony Tamayo jointly conducted the mass, assisted by 12 priests. Following the ceremony, the former mayor was buried at the Panteón de Los Ángeles cemetery.

She is also known for her work with DNA gene mutations. Her interest in DNA damage has inspired her to research radiation biology and radiation therapy and how radiation affects DNA. Jeggo has almost 170 publication that pertain to DNA damage, radiation, and cancer research and has received 3 top science awards/medals for her research. Jeggo has also been a member of several organizations that pertain to radiation biology; these organizations include Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE), National Institute for Radiation Science laboratory researcher, and the Multidisciplinary European Low Dose Initiative (MELODI). Not only is Jeggo a member of these prestigious organizations, but she is also an editor for several publication journals that are related to cancer and radiation biology. Jeggo is very passionate towards all her research and in an interview with Fiona Watt claimed that “Although my results contributed only the tiniest smidgeon to scientific knowledge, I gained immense satisfaction from it”.  Early life and education  Penny Jeggo was born in Cambridge, England. She earned a bachelor's degree in microbiology at Queen Elizabeth College, University of London in 1970. She went on to earn a PhD in genetics at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), London, in the lab of Robin Holliday. She later held postdoctoral positions with John Cairns, whom she cites as one of her biggest mentors, at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Mill Hill Laboratory, and with Miroslav Radman at the Université libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. After working for Radman, Jeggo returned in 1980 to Robin Holliday's lab where she began her research on DNA damage and the cells response to the damage. After more work in Radman's lab, Jeggo, in 1989, moved to the Cell Mutation Unit at Sussex. When Jeggo reached her thirties, she and her husband decided to start a family. She gave birth to a son, Matthew. Her husband and Matthew's father passed away from colon cancer shortly after Matthew was born. The death of Jeggo's husband almost discouraged her from continuing her research in cancer and radiation biology. Jeggo returned to her research and further researched cancer and DNA a few years after her husband's death.  Career and legacy  Jeggo's primary legacy is her work on DNA damage responses and DNA repair of double strand breaks. Much of her early worked involved Chinese hamster ovary cells, a commonly studied cell line also known as CHO. Using standard techniques of microbial genetics, she tested more than 9,000 colonies before isolating six X-ray-sensitive mutants. This was the first step in understanding the mechanisms involved in the repair of X-irradiation-induced DNA damage. Jeggo is particularly well known for identifying two components of an enzyme called DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as being important in DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a pathway by which mammalian cells repair themselves. This discovery was a major breakthrough in understanding the double strand break repair pathway in mammals. In addition, Jeggo showed that NHEJ is important for the development of the immune response. She also studied LIG4-mutant mice and how exposure to oxygen increases the number of double-stranded breaks due to the failure to repair DNA breaks.  Positions and events  Penelope Jeggo has been very active in various symposiums and conventions where she has discussed her research and given talks on cell biology in relation to radiation biology. In 2001, Jeggo became a founding member of the Genome Damage and Stability Center, a research center established at the University of Sussex. In 2002, Jeggo was a lecturer for the 6th Cancer/Genome Priority Seminar at the Nagasaki University. She discussed the importance of low-dose radiation and molecular cell biology. In 2003, Jeggo was given the title of Professorial Fellow of the University Sussex. She also attended the 2003 Gordon Research Conference on Genetic Toxicology as the conference chair. In 2012, Jeggo was elected into the Academy of Medical Science Fellows along with 46 other British researchers for their dedication to research and for their contributions to the medical sciences. In 2014, Jeggo was the chair of the Scientific Advisory Board for the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Society. Jeggo was an invited speakers for the symposium on DNA damage response to radiation in 2015 at the International Congress of Radiation Research (ICRR). Jeggo will be representing the United Kingdom as one of the keynote speakers at the World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering in Prague 2018.  Awards  In her career so far, Jeggo has won the 2011 Penelope Jeggo Bacq and Alexander Award for her research with radiation biology and cancer. She was also the 2013 recipient of the United Kingdom Genome Stability Network medal for her research in DNA damage of the cell. Penelope Jeggo won her third award in 2013 for the Silvanus Thompson Medal from the British Institute of Radiology. Her third award was also for her research in radiation and DNA damage.  Other research and publications  One of Jeggo's first publication was on her research with double stranded DNA break repair mutants and the effect it has on V(D)J recombination. Jeggo and her fellow researchers discovered that two mutants, xrs-6 and XR-1, play a role in restoring V(D)J recombination and were able to identify which genes are affected by DNA breakage. In her most recent publication, Jeggo worked with other researchers on the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein (ATR) and how mutation in ATR can damage DNA which consequently prevents cilia signaling. The team used zebrafish as a model organism in order to test the protein defect and its effects on cilia. Jeggo had researched this subject previously in 2003 when she and fellow scientists concluded that when ATR is exposed to UV radiation, caused a splice mutation in DNA which led to Seckel syndrome, a disorder that retards growth while the fetus develops in the uterus. To continue her research with DNA damage, Jeggo studied aging and stem cells. She found that the inability of DNA Ligase IV to repair breaks in stem cell DNA contributes to aging of our cells. Jeggo and her team found that breaks in the stem cell DNA come from genetics as well as environmental stress which increase inhibits the lifespan of stem cells and therefore contributes to aging. Jeggo has also began researching epigenetic changes and the effects that epigenetics have on DNA repair. She found that a mutation in ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) causes damage to DNA and chromatin structure. Jeggo's review showed that nucleosomes are important in DNA repair. However, she claims that more research on the changes in chromatin structure is necessary in further understanding of DNA damage and repair mechanisms.

He amassed La Liga totals of 110 matches and six goals during seven seasons, representing mainly Real Madrid. In 2011, he became a manager. Playing career Born in Madrid, Maqueda spent 16 years with Real Madrid youth and reserve sides comprised. He made his La Liga debut on 2 January 1988 still not aged 19, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 home win against FC Barcelona. Late in the same month he scored his first goal with the main squad, contributing to a 4–0 success over Cádiz CF also at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Maqueda returned to Real in the summer of 1990, after a season-long loan with CD Logroñés. He contributed with 24 games – 19 starts – and one goal in the first year upon his return, but the team ranked in third place; he added three appearances in the European Cup, netting in a 4–1 away win over Odense Boldklub on 18 September 1990. Maqueda spent nearly two years on the sidelines due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury, from which he never fully recovered. After leaving the Merengues, he subsequently played with six clubs in as many years, appearing for Valencia CF and Albacete Balompié in the top flight and having abroad stints with Irapuato F.C. and Panionios FC; he retired in 2000, at 31. Coaching career Maqueda spent six years as assistant manager to Juan Ramón López Caro, with the pair being in charge of Real Madrid and Levante UD in the top level and RC Celta de Vigo in Segunda División. They worked for a few months with FC Vaslui, leaving in October 2010. Maqueda began working as a head coach in 2011, with El Ittihad Alexandria in Egypt.

It derives its name from the Latin name of the mountain, Mons Jovis (mountain of Jupiter). The oldest account of the castle dates to 1278, when it was owned by Hugo of Montalban. It was probably constructed about thirty years before the first account referencing it. In 1368, it was acquired by the lords of Starkenberg, and in 1540, it passed to Sinkmoser. The period from its construction to the mid 1500s was the castle's heyday. After several more changes of ownership, in 1813, it was sold to a local farmer, Josef Blaas. The castle was passed down through generations and was owned by the Blaas family until World War II, when it was taken over by the Nazis. Since 1983, it has been the summer residence (July and August) of famous mountaineer Reinhold Messner, who has partially converted it into a museum displaying works of Tibetan art and a collection of masks from five continents. A later restoration of the castle was presided over by Vinschgau architect Karl Spitaler. It is one of the venues of the Messner Mountain Museum. The museum is closed in the summer months, when Messner resides in the castle. Around the castle there is a path open to the public along which there are informational signs relating to the botanical features on the grounds. For private individuals, the castle is accessible only on foot with an hour-long walk or by using a special bus service.

In 1871 she was wrecked near Tierra del Fuego after the crew members gallantly saved the crew of another windjammer Knight Errant. Description The Sam Cearns was built in 1864 by Scott & Co at Cartsdyke, Greenock as Yard No 97 for H T Wilson & Chambers' White Star Line. She was built with an iron hull and rigged as a three-masted full-rigged ship. She was 315.5 feet in length, 36.3 feet in breadth and had a depth of hold of 25 feet; she measured 1402 gross tons. She was launched on 22 June 1864. Commercial service She sailed from Liverpool on her maiden voyage with 367 passengers and 45 crew, arriving at Melbourne on 17 October 1864 after 80 days at sea, during which 4 passengers died. On 17 November 1864 Sam Cearns departed Hobsons Bay, Melbourne for Madras. After taking on a cargo of jute, linseed, cotton, and saltpeter, the Sam Cearns arrived at Liverpool from Calcutta on 13 August 1865. This maiden voyage could have been her last as she caught fire in the entrance lock, but it was successfully extinguished. The Sam Cearns' second voyage to Melbourne from Liverpool for White Star Line took 88 days and arrived on 25 December 1865. Thereafter she traded more widely, including Sydney NSW, Port Chalmers and San Francisco. Final voyage On this last voyage, the ship under Capt Frederick Williams had already suffered 30 days of smallpox and a near-mutiny when, off Tierra del Fuego, on 22 June 1871 she came upon the Liverpool ship Knight Errant about to break up in a heavy gale. Williams hove to and attempted to launch their lifeboat but this was destroyed by breaking seas; led by mate Edwin Wright with a volunteer crew, a second boat set off and took off all the crew of Knight Errant in three trips - on the last the boat was destroyed as it returned to Sam Cearns, the master of Knight Errant,mate Edwin Wright and five others were killed with only four getting on board; a search with Sam Cearns' last boat found no more alive - 24 from Knight Errant were saved. In the aftermath, Sam Cearns herself was wrecked on 26 June 1871 in the same heavy gale but all aboard were able to get off via the rigging to shore. In driving snow they remained in a makeshift shelter for two weeks until they were able to hail a passing schooner (actually a wrecker's vessel). All sixty survivors were taken by the schooner to Port Stanley. Capt Williams received the gold medal of the Liverpool Shipwreck & Humane Society and every volunteer member of the rescuing boat the silver medal, and a gratuity to the widow of the mate. Williams was absolved of all blame for the loss of Sam Cearns but was \\"tired of windjamming\\" and intended to go to a steamship line, where pay and conditions were better.

The game features figurines representing characters in the game and uses cards to control their behaviors, such as attacking. Both cards and figurines are placed on a game board, with their position on the board influencing their powers and abilities. After an initial release date set in 2015 and not in 2016, the studio announced that Prodigy's release would be delayed due to an upgrade of its gameplay system. A Kickstarter campaign to fund the game's alpha and beta phases began in April 2014, with a $100,000 funding goal. It reached its goal in just three days, eventually collecting $200,000 from over 1,000 backers. A incomplete version of the game was released on September 2018, physical goods from the Kickstarter campaign remain unfulfilled. Gameplay Prodigy Tactics was intended to be a tactical role-playing game played with figurines representing game characters placed on a 3x4 board. The board uses near field communication (NFC) technology. Each square on the board's grid gives different capabilities to the characters in the video game. The front row gives offensive bonuses, while the back row gives defensive bonuses. The middle line is neutral. Characters can be moved freely around the board, with no action points or other forms of limitation. There was to be an initial group of 23 figurines for the game. The player places Arcana cards on the game board to make characters perform actions such as attacking. Combinations of cards placed on the board trigger special actions unique to each character. Special skills, unlike normal actions, require mana. The game was to included a large single- player campaign including boss battles, as well as competitive multiplayer. In both modes, the player's team is controlled through the figurines, while the opponent's or IA's team is displayed on the video game screen as the physical item support was removed this is now incomplete. Plot There are two main factions in the game. The Sorcerer Kings are powerful masters of mana who control the northern territories. The Free People are slaves and soldiers who rebelled against their former masters and now control the southern territories. Henchmen are characters who can join any Company of the Sorcerer Kings, while Allies can join any Free People Company. Legends are more powerful than Henchmen and Allies, and can fight for any Company. Bosses can also be controlled by anyone, but can also be fought against. Development All of the figures are much more detailed than similar figurines for games such as Skylanders and Disney Infinity, and were designed by veteran figurine modeler Jean Bey, who had previously funded miniature figure game developer Rackham.  Kickstarter Incomplete  The physical goods from the Kickstarter campaign that was funded in 2014 have gone unfulfilled and replies regarding their status unanswered by Hanakai Studios, Forever Entertainment, or other publishers involved with the partial game release now called Prodigy Tactics. As of July 2020 Backers have received nothing that they have paid for in physical goods.

Retrieved April 7, 2014. While a college student at the University of Colorado, Roberta Cooper was majoring in Italian and philosophy when she met Barry Ramo, a medical resident whose father was a Denver physician. Barry Ramo's uncle is Simon Ramo, one of the founders of TRW Inc., the aerospace and credit reporting company now known as Experian. After Roberta and Barry married, they moved to Chicago, where Barry completed his cardiology residency and Roberta attended the University of Chicago School of Law as one of only six women in her law school class. The couple moved to North Carolina so that he could pursue a fellowship at Duke University, but Roberta was rejected by law firms there. In an interview many years later, she recalled being told directly that women lawyers were not being considered. \\"I remember interviewing with one fellow who misread his list and probably thought it said 'Robert' and was really nice and explained there was just no way his firm would ever consider hiring a woman,\\" Ramo told the Los Angeles Times. She eventually found a job with the Ford Foundation, then spent two years teaching constitutional law at historically black Shaw University in Raleigh during the civil rights struggle. Roberta Cooper Ramo and Barry Ramo have two children, Joshua Cooper Ramo, a journalist and author, and Jennifer Anne Ramo, a lawyer and anti-poverty advocate. Ramo's father, David Cooper, was chairman of Western Warehouse, a clothing-store chain based in Albuquerque.

The district covers about , and includes the town common, laid out in 1765, and the buildings arrayed around it. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Although the territory that is now Fitzwilliam was first granted in 1752, it was not settled until 1765 due to a significant number of Indian raids in the area until after the French and Indian War. Its center became the crossing point of a number of turnpikes in the first half of the 19th century, which is when most of the buildings around the common were built. Most of the buildings around the common are either Federal or Greek Revival in their styling. There are only two buildings with later styling, both Italianate: the c. 1870 Henry House, and the 1857 Fitzwilliam Community Church. The Connelly House, a c. 1795 house, was restyled in the 1830s with Greek Revival features. Prominent public buildings on the common include the 1817 town hall, separately listed on the National Register, the public library, built as a private home in 1804 and sold to the town in 1912, and an early fire engine house from c. 1827. Notable commercial buildings include the Fitzwilliam Inn (1843) and the Fitzwilliam Market (1859).

The award is named after computer game programmer Seumas McNally (1979–2000), founder of independent game development company Longbow Digital Arts. McNally died of Hodgkin's lymphoma shortly after receiving the award in 2000 for his game Tread Marks. The award is given alongside a prize of US$30,000. Nineteen video games have received the award, and more than 50 have been selected as finalists. Fire and Darkness became the first recipient of the award in the 1999 edition of the Independent Games Festival. The award was split into two for the 2004 and 2005 Independent Games Festival events, but was merged back into a single prize in 2006. From 2011 onwards, a list of \\"Honorable Mentions\\", composed of games that were not finalists, was introduced. Gish and Seed are the only games to become finalists in multiple editions of the event. Additionally, Gish is the only finalist to win the prize in a subsequent edition of the festival. FTL: Faster Than Light was the first game to have been both an honorable mention and a finalist, achieving the former in 2012 and the latter in 2013. The Stanley Parable achieved the same feat, becoming an honorable mention in 2013 and a finalist in 2014. Games do not have to be published in order to qualify for the prize. When Fez won the award in 2012, it was still undergoing pre-release certification. Some developers have won the prize twice, either solo or as part of a larger team: Alec Holowka for Aquaria and Night in the Woods, and Lucas Pope for Papers, Please and Return of the Obra Dinn.

After the initial Italian invasion starting 28 October had been stopped, Greek forces launched an counter-offensive in early November. The battle for Korytsa formed the first part of the operation against the Italians and marked the final stage of the Greek penetration in the Battle of Morava–Ivan heights sector. The Italian 9th Army was entrenched around the town, but fierce fighting over two days led to the break-through of the Italian defensive line by the Greeks and its capture. Remnants of the 9th Army itself avoided capture, as the opposing Greek forces were poorly motorized and unable to pursue the retreating Italians.

The film was released in Brazil on May 1, 2014, coinciding with the Workers' Day official holiday – in reference to the labor policies implemented by Getúlio. Plot The plot begins in August 1954, after the attempted murder of Carlos Lacerda (Alexandre Borges), owner of the opposition newspaper, then, president Getúlio has to confront with the increasing instability of his government, in addition to the charges of ordering the murder of his political enemy. Cast * Tony Ramos as Getúlio Vargas * Drica Moraes as Alzira Vargas * Alexandre Borges as Carlos Lacerda * Leonardo Medeiros as General Caiado * Fernando Luís as Benjamim Vargas * Daniel Dantas as Member of the Opposition * Murilo Elbas as João Zaratimi * Sílvio Matos as General Carneiro de Menezes * José Raposo as Nero Moura * Adriano Garib as General Genóbio da Costa * Thiago Justino as Gregório Fortunato * Luciano Chirolli as General Tavares * Marcelo Médici as Lutero Vargas *Clarisse Abujamra as Clarisse Vargas Production =Development= With experience in documentary films, the director João Jardim has gathered an extensive material research, including films and rare books, documents and biographies of contemporary politicians, as well as notes of Alzira Vargas, Getúlio's daughter. \\"This allowed a deep dive on the contradictory figure of the political leader, and nationalist dictator,\\" praises Tony Ramos. The idea for the film came about, according to the director, shortly after filming the documentary Pro Dia Nascer Feliz about education and schools in Brazil. \\"What I loved was not talking about Getúlio, but tell a story that echoes still today, which is connected with the formation of our country, with our current moment\\". Jardim revealed that chose Tony Ramos for the role due to his similarities of personality with the character. \\"Getúlio was reserved and charismatic, I was looking for someone like that, and the differential of Tony was the talent. He does everything brilliantly\\" admits, emphasizing the originality of the story in his film. \\"It's a story that completes 60 years and that had never been told,\\" he said. =Filming= Filming took place in the Catete Palace, in Rio de Janeiro, seat of the federal government at the time and where Getúlio killed himself with a gunshot to the chest, in 1954.

It was a sport touring motorcycle with more focus on touring than sports. Based on a ZZR-1100 motor without the ram air and detuned for more mid-range performance, it also had smaller carburetors and a more restrictive exhaust. The bike was more focused on being economical with budget brakes and suspension. Instead of the Ninjas ZX-11's alloy frame, the bike had a steel double cradle frame with a removable front member for engine removal. The motorcycle had a more relaxed seating position and leg position than the ZX-11D/ZZR-1100 or the air-cooled GPZ1100 of the early 1980s .The official Kawasaki designation was ZX1100E.

The book was first published on February 7, 2012 through Knopf and collects eight of Englander's short stories, including the title story \\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank.\\" The title of the collection takes its influence from Raymond Carver's 1981 short story collection What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. The book was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, losing to Adam Johnson's The Orphan Master's Son. Englander's collection was awarded the 2012 Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award. Stories *\\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank\\" was originally published in the December 12, 2011 edition of The New Yorker and was included in The Best American Short Stories of 2012. Like Carver's story, \\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,\\" Englander's story centers around two middle-aged married couples sitting around a table and sharing a bottle of liquor (in Carver's story, it is gin and in Englander's, vodka and pot). The story is told by a first-person present narrator who is married to Debbie and they live together in South Florida. Debbie's childhood friend from Yeshiva school, Lauren, who is now known as Shoshana, is visiting from Jerusalem with her husband, Mark, who has adopted the name, Yerucham. The narrator describes Shoshana and Yerucham as having gone \\"off to the Holy Land and went from Orthodox to ultra- Orthodox.\\" The climax of the story occurs when Debbie and Shoshana revive a childhood game, the Anne Frank game, in which they speculate who among their non-Jewish friends would save them in the event of a second Holocaust. *\\"Sister Hills\\" \\"traces the growth of a small Israeli settlement from a couple of shacks into a thriving Jerusalem suburb, depicts the emotionally fraught relationship between two neighbors: one, named Rena, loses her husband and her three sons to the war and unhappy accident; the other, named Yehudit, has nine children and lives a vibrant, satisfying life. When Yehudit’s daughter Aheret was a baby, on the verge of death from a high fever, Yehudit was so desperate she indulged an old superstition: to outsmart the Angel of Death, she 'sold' Aheret to Rena for a pittance. Aheret survived, grew up to be a young woman, and now Rena, alone and bitter, decides to reclaim her, insisting that the girl forfeit her freedom and come to live with her as a caregiver.\\" *\\"How We Avenged the Blums\\" first appeared in The Atlantic (Summer/Fall 2005) and was included in the Best American Short Stories 2006. *\\"Peep Show\\" was originally published in the July 26, 1999 edition of The New Yorker. Its protagonist, Allen Fein (formerly known as Ari Feinberg) is on his way to the Port Authority to go home to his pregnant, \\"beautiful blond Gentile wife,\\" when he encounters three rabbis from his old school at a peep show. Upon seeing the rabbis, Fein feels enormous guilt for leaving his religion. He also feels guilt for having been, as he believes, unfaithful to his wife, Claire, whom he imagines is on the other side of a partition as a performer in the peep show along with his mother. *\\"Everything I Know About My Family On My Mother's Side\\" first appeared in Esquire in July 2008 and was included in Best American Nonrequired Reading 2009. *\\"Camp Sundown\\" *\\"The Reader\\" first appeared in Electric Literature in September 2011. *\\"Free Fruit for Young Widows\\" was originally published in the May 17, 2010 edition of The New Yorker and was included in Best American Short Stories 2011. Reception Critical reception for What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank has been mostly positive and the book received praise from the Washington Times, Los Angeles Times, and the Jewish Book Council. In The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani gave the book a mixed-to-positive review, stating: \\"At his best, Mr. Englander manages to delineate such extreme behavior with a combination of psychological insight, allegorical gravity and sometimes uproarious comedy\\" but that \\"In several instances, however, the delicate narrative balance slips from Mr. Englander’s grasp.\\" Kakutani also notes: \\"It’s the title story and “Everything I Know About My Family” that point to Mr. Englander’s evolution as a writer, his ability to fuse humor and moral seriousness into a seamless narrative, to incorporate elliptical — yes, Carver-esque — techniques into his arsenal of talents to explore how faith and family (and the stories characters tell about faith and family) ineluctably shape an individual’s identity.\\" James Lasdun's review for The Guardian was more positive, adding: \\"If there is an abiding theme, it is the way in which notions of right and wrong, guilt and innocence, victim and oppressor, shift over time as memories fade or new perspectives open up on old struggles.\\" Lasdun also offered praise for Englander: \\"The new book (which comes garlanded with praise from just about every A-list author in America) turns out to be a remarkable collection, not least because of its courageous determination to push forward in the direction hinted at by that last story.\\" He did, however characterize the title story as a \\"dud, or semi- dud\\" and noted: \\"But I suspect Englander might have pulled it off if he hadn't constrained himself so tightly within the terms of Carver's scrupulous realism.\\" The book received an honourable mention in the Sophie Brody Award 2013.

Main characters ; : : Portrayed by: Suzu Hirose, (young) :A determined high school girl who was inspired by Arata in elementary school to play karuta and to dream of becoming the \\"Queen\\" of karuta. She begins a karuta club at her high school with Taichi. She is first introduced to competitive karuta by her childhood friend, Arata. Karuta has remained as Chihaya's passion despite being separated from Arata. She has an exceptional hearing ability that gives her an advantage in playing karuta. While she is beautiful, she is considered too weird, her classmates referring to her as a \\"beauty in vain\\". She is crazy about karuta (her friends calls her \\"karuta baka\\"), to the point that she can be oblivious to other people's feelings. Chihaya is the captain of Mizusawa Karuta Club. She works very hard at improving her karuta skills, and reaches Class A near the beginning of the series. She is a strong, passionate person who loves karuta and is dedicated to her teammates and friends. Chihaya shares a strong bond of trust and friendship with Taichi and appreciates his skill in leading the club, though oblivious towards his feelings for her. Chihaya cares deeply for Arata, despite their long-distance relationship. While on the telephone with Arata, she realizes that she will always love him and karuta. ; : : Portrayed by: Shuhei Nomura, (young) :A good-looking, all-rounded sportsman and Chihaya's childhood best friend. His mother is very strict with him, telling him that he should stick to activities he can win at. He seems to have feelings for Chihaya although he had a girlfriend at the beginning, and is jealous of her feelings for Arata. Taichi is the president of Mizusawa Karuta Club. He is a talented student and an athlete, at the beginning of the series he claims to have outgrown 'karuta', but then, after watching Chihaya excelling and obviously having fun, he decides to help her form a karuta club. He has good analytical skills and a good memory when playing karuta, but he has very bad luck. Due to this, he ends up staying in Class B longer than supposed to. He has been in love with Chihaya ever since childhood (and eventually realizes his feelings) but never confessed to her. When Sumire tried to confess to Taichi, he tells her that he would rather have a relationship with the girl he loves than with a girl who loves him, indirectly indicating Chihaya. He cares for her very deeply, being there for her every time Chihaya gets upset or sad. He has serious character to make up for Chihaya's comical character. As a child, Taichi was a rich, spoiled child and disliked Arata, making fun of him for being poor, but as soon as he, Chihaya, and Arata started to play Karuta together, they became friends. In terms of love, Taichi still views Arata as his enemy. ; : : Portrayed by: Mackenyu, (young) :Arata Wataya was a transfer student to Chihaya's elementary school, grandchild of an eternal master karuta player, Arata inspires Chihaya to take up karuta.

He has beaten \\"The Queen\\" Shinobu Wakamiya and is aiming to beat \\"Master\\" Hishashi Suo to claim the position of \\"Master\\". Arata cherishes his friendship with both Chihaya and Taichi, albeit romantically to Chihaya. Later in the manga, Arata confesses his love to Chihaya, also informing her of his move back to Tokyo.

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for Lanark, Ontario. Lanark was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1942–1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 25 September 1943 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec and launched 10 December 1943. She was commissioned into the RCN on 6 July 1944 at Montreal. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named after towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After working up in Bermuda, Lanark was assigned to the newly formed Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-7 in October 1944. Captained by John Stairs of Montreal. Until June 1945, she served as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort with the group, usually as the Senior Officer's Ship. In June 1945, she returned to Canada, beginning a tropicalization refit in mid-July in preparation for service in the South Pacific Ocean. The refit was cancelled on 31 August 1945 due to the Surrender of Japan and Lanark was paid off at Sydney, Nova Scotia on 24 October. =Postwar service= Lanark was sold to Marine Industries Ltd. in 1946. In 1954, Lanark was repurchased by the Royal Canadian Navy and sent for conversion to a Prestonian-class frigate. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti-submarine mortars. The conversion was begun in 1954 and completed in 1955. Lanark was re-commissioned into the RCN on 15 April 1956 with the new pennant number 321. Lanark served mainly on the eastern coast with the Seventh Canadian Escort Squadron as a training ship. On 12 January 1960, Lanark was sent to recover the reserve training ship off Scatari Island, after the training ship had snapped its tow while en route for a refit at Sydney, Nova Scotia. Lanark took the ship in tow in heavy seas after the ocean-going tugboat Riverton was forced to head for shelter due to the heavy seas. Lanark brought the ship to Sydney, where Riverton took over the tow into the harbour. In May 1960, the frigate began a tour of the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway, making several port visits. In March 1961, Lanark was among the ships that took part in a combined naval exercise with the United States Navy off Nova Scotia. She served until 19 March 1965 when she was paid off for the last time. She was sold in 1965 and taken to La Spezia, Italy to be broken up in 1966.

During the Cold War, the work of the FIR was closely connected with issues of peace, disarmament, understanding and cooperation of countries of different political systems. The FIR gave the former resistance fighters a voice against the policy of military confrontation and the real threat of war. Member organizations in West and East took numerous initiatives to end the policy of confrontation.  History  The FIR was founded in June 1951 in Vienna. It was formed by an earlier organization called the International Federation of Former Political Prisoners; the latter organization had been founded in Paris in 1947.Facts about international Communist front organisations p. 85 (Other sources say 1946.Hoover Institution Yearbook on international communist affairs 1966 Stanford, Calif., Hoover Institution Press. p.511 (Yearbook on International Communist Affairs series)) In the following decades, FIR organized conferences on medical, political and historical themes. The aim was also to prove that the destruction of German fascism was not only the work of Army organizations, but that the role of partisans and resistance fighters were kept in good memory. To preserve the memory of the post-war generations, FIR set-up a historical commission, which published a total of ten “International issues of the resistance movement”, studies of the antifascist resistance fight in various European countries, including impressive reports on the uprising in Paris, Prague and Northern Italy as well as documents on the resistance in the concentration and extermination camps and the international participation in the national liberation struggle in various European countries, with a specific attention to the Jewish resistance movement. The aim of this memory was the historical education of young generations. The medical and social conferences of the FIR highlighted the health consequences of persecution in Nazi prisons and the medical consequences for family members and the enforcement of appropriate compensation. There were repeated argumentation with social supply points about how long-term health damage by the prison time can be evaluated. Reputable physicians sat for the interests of a former persecuted and helped those that appropriate care and financial compensation was given. A key task was the fight against the resurgence of neo-fascist organizations and political restoration, particularly in the Federal Republic of Germany. FIR repeatedly documented the reality of fascist crimes, to show what were the inhuman results of such a policy. But FIR did not only intelligence work. As Nazi graffiti became increasingly impertinent in Germany and further to the desecration of the Cologne synagogue in December 1959, FIR suggested to convene an “International Conference against the resurgence of Nazism and anti-Semitism”. Together with the International League for Human Rights, the Union of Israeli Jewish communities in Italy, the ANPPIA and ANED, FIR organized this conference in March 1960 in Florence, which was attended by 130 delegates from 13 countries. A further step in the battle against the forces of the past, can be found in the campaign against the Association HIAG (“Aid Society of former member of the Waffen-SS”), initiated by the FIR the “International meeting against the re-emergence of Nazism and Fascism” in October 1963 in Florence. Under pressure from the FIR, HIAG call off their planned “European Convention”. During the seventies, FIR supported the creation of a system of common security and cooperation in Europe. Along with other veterans’ organizations, particularly the World Veterans Federation (FMAC), FIR organized a “world meeting of former combatants for Disarmament” in 1979 in Rome. = FIR today = In 2004, at the XIII regular congress in Berlin, FIR adopted a new statute that allowed the integration of young anti- fascists; since that time, the organization is named “International Federation of Resistance Fighters – Association of Anti-fascists” (FIR). Today, the FIR incorporate member organizations in more than 25 European countries and Israel. The political circumstances have changed, but the main problem is fixed in the slogan “never again”. This means to disclose the historical truth about the resistance struggle, the reality of fascism and the role of the anti-Hitler coalition, the allied forces – including the Soviet soldiers who bore the brunt of the war – the destruction of the fascist barbarism. Due to various activities and initiatives for disarmament and international cooperation, the Secretary General of the United Nations, on 15 September 1987, designated FIR as “Peace Messenger”. FIR is also the only antifascist organization officially accredited at the EU Transparency Register.Transparency Register  Organization  = Structure = The federation is currently structured with national associations gathered in an Advisory Council – and an Executive Committee made of 10 members.

Their musical style has been compared to that of \\"early XTC and Talking Heads,\\" Violent Femmes, Nirvana, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Bon Iver.CG: Sleeping in the Aviary History The band's two core members were guitarist-vocalist Elliott Kozel and bassist Phil Mahlstadt. They formed Sleeping in the Aviary in 2003 in Madison, where it played its first show in the spring of 2004. They cycled through several additional members before deciding on drummer Michael Sienkowski as their band's third member. Kozel has offered conflicting explanations for the origin of the band's name, such as that he came up with it after his uncle sent him a bottle of Australian cologne by the same name, or that it, in his words, \\"came from a sexual experience our guitar player Porkchop [referring to Kyle Sobczak] had as a 12-year-old boy.\\" Celeste Heule, an accordion and musical saw player, joined the band in 2008. Also that year, Kozel moved from Madison to Minneapolis. Late in 2010, after their third album, Great Vacation! was released, Kozel and his girlfriend parted ways, and several months later, he said he was planning for their next album to be a breakup record replete with “fuzzed-out, doo-wop music”. The band went on tour for nearly two months at the start of 2011. Later that year, they promoted their fourth album, You and Me, Ghost, by making a 13-minute infomercial described by the Minnesota Daily as \\"a tongue-in-cheek homage to all those late night advertisements you’ve probably fallen asleep to once or twice.\\" Fancy Ray McCloney appears in the video. Also in 2011, while the band was breaking up, Kozel formed a side project called Tickle Torture. His first release as Tickle Torture was an EP entitled Spiritual Machine, released in 2012, which was followed by the release of another EP, Spectrophilia, in 2014. Kozel has described Tickle Torture as \\"like if Prince and Justin Timberlake were [having sex] in a dumpster.\\" Reception KCMP has described Sleeping in the Aviary's music as \\"energetic pop-rock\\". A Punknews.org reviewer described the band's debut album, Oh, This Old Thing?, as \\"snotty, fuck-all lo-fi power-pop,\\" while Wisconsin Public Television described their style as \\"country-punk-rock.\\" Reviewers have also noted that Sleeping in the Aviary's music resembles that of the 1950s and 60's, and have compared the music on their fourth album, \\"You and Me, Ghost,\\" to The Clean, the Knack, and Guided by Voices. A Minnesota Daily review of You and Me, Ghost wrote that \\"Perhaps Sleeping in the Aviary’s most commendable feat is their ability to take some of the most basic elements of early rock ‘n’ roll and mold their music into something that sounds entirely original\\" and concluded that the band was \\"this city’s best-kept secret\\" [referring to Minneapolis].

Abbreviated psh, it is also known as shield plains due to the shield like structures formed in its region. It is characterized by its abundant clusters of small shield dome structures located throughout the unit and lack of pervasive tectonic deformation. The domes that characterize the unit are likely volcanic edifices, the result of multiple small volcanic eruptions over an extended period of time. It formed during the second half of the Guineverian Period, in which vast plains formed globally on Venus. It is one of 14 formations identified by Mikhail A. Ivanov and James W. Head. Description thumb  left  The planet Venus, where the Accruva Formation is located. Most of the Accruva Formation is located on the Northern half of the hemisphere. Image from Wikimedia The Accruva Formation is also known as shield plains because of the shield shaped structures that form in close proximity to each other. The surface of this area is notably different from the other 14 formations mapped on Venus due to the clusters of shield plains, the morphologically smooth transition from the shields to the plains in between the shield plains, and the low amount of deformation within this region, only observably containing a few wrinkle ridges. The shield structures themselves can range from a few kilometers to greater than 10 kilometers in diameter. The formation region tends to occur as equidimensional patches several tens to hundreds of kilometers across. The relief of the formation is hilly due to the clusters of shield domes. The hypsogram of the Accruva Formation almost perfectly matches the overall hypsogram of Venus, which indicates that this formation represents the general topographic level of Venus. thumb  right  Over time formation of shield dome, one of many that constitutes the Accruva Formation. Image created by GeoGifs4Gesus Formation The shield structures are believed to be of volcanic origin. These shields typically found in close proximity with each other and will form groups of structures. The transition between the shields and the plains in between the shields is morphologically smooth and sometimes contains wrinkle ridges. This is the first unit that display no pervasive deformation. Along with the volcanic shields, slight deformation is present evidenced by wrinkle ridges and a few fractures and grabens. Likely the shields form in multiple stages over time, rather than from a single event. Single eruption events would more likely cause very large shield volcanoes, instead of the clusters of small, approximately 10 km diameter, shield domes found within the Accruva Formation.\\"Ivanov 2004\\"> They frequently form in clusters of 100 km in diameter. This indicates that this eruption pattern of small individual eruptions was widespread and continued for an extended period of time.

This system defines and maps rock units based on the description of the observable characteristics at the surface due to lacking other information. This is the common method used for classifying formations on other planets where we lack the necessary information to classify as we do on earth, which is classifying by its position within geologic time.

He left the House after he was convicted of willful failure to file Federal income tax returns. Early life and education O'Connor was born on November 9, 1924 in Boston. His father, David I. O'Connor, was a funeral director in Roxbury. He attended Mission High School, the Boston School of Business Administration, and Staley College. After becoming a state representative he attended the Boston School of Anatomy and Embalming and University of Massachusetts Boston. After high school, O'Connor enlisted in the United States Navy. He was stationed on the USS Chester during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Political career O'Connor first became involved in politics as a community activist in Roxbury. From 1951 to 1970 he was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. During his tenure as a state representative, O'Connor's interests included finance, consumer protection, housing, and supporting the policies of Democratic governors Paul A. Dever, Foster Furcolo, and Endicott Peabody. O'Connor was a staunch supporter of the Furcolo administration and backed the governor's proposal to create a 3% sales tax. In 1960 Furcolo appointed O'Connor to a six-year term on the Boston Licensing Board. In 1956, O'Connor helped obtain the release of a Dorchester mother of four who was arrested by Boston Police at 4:30 am for parking violations. After the incident, O'Connor a bill that would make it a crime for police to serve parking warrants between 10 pm and 7 am. In 1958, O'Connor supported John F. Thompson, a friend and fellow World War II veteran, in his quest to become Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. O'Connor supported Thompson in spite of opposition from many powerful Democrats including John F. Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, and Endicott Peabody. On May 31, 1960, O'Connor purchased a vacant lot abutting his funeral home for $300 at a city auction. The sale was voided after William H. McBain, who represented abutting business owner, filed a complaint. McBain claimed that he had the site under observation on the morning the auction was to take place, but did not see anyone on the lot. The Real Property Board voided the sale and order that a second auction be held. McBain, however, withdrew his complaint and did not bid at the second auction because he wanted to keep the good will of his state representative, as there were bills under consideration that could hurt the business he worked for. O'Connor purchased the property at the second auction for $800. The incident was brought before the Boston Finance Commission in 1962 after Real Property Commissioner James J. Sullivan cited the auction as one of the complaints he had to handle since taking office. No action was taken against O'Connor, however, the Finance Commission demanded the dismissal of City Auctioneer John J. McGrath and the abolition of the City Auctioneer's position. On February 4, 1970, O'Connor was convicted of willful failure to file Federal income tax returns. According to prosecutors, O'Connor did not file income tax returns for the years 1962 and 1963, during which time he had a total income of $44,000. He was sentenced to five months in jail and fined $10,000. Later life and death After his retirement, O'Connor resided at his former summer home in Hull, Massachusetts and at the home of his longtime partner in Nokomis, Florida. He died on May 5, 2011 in Sarasota, Florida at the age of 86.

Headquartered in Markham, Ontario, it sells canned, shelf-stable, and frozen goods under the Clover Leaf and Brunswick brands. The company's products include tuna, salmon, oysters, mussels, clams, shrimp, crab, lobster and sardines. Clover Leaf Seafoods, a wholly owned subsidiary of Connors Bros., L.P., markets Bumble Bee (USA) Seafoods. History Clover Leaf Seafoods office in Markham Clover Leaf Seafoods products Clover Leaf Seafoods traces its roots back to 1871 when Alexander Ewen and three partners founded Loggie & Company, the first commercial salmon cannery in British Columbia, Canada. The cannery was located on the south shore of the Fraser River opposite New Westminster on a site that's now part of North Delta (founded as Annieville). In 1902, Loggie & Company merged with some of its local competitors to form the British Columbia Packers' Association, which was chartered as a New Jersey-based entity to take advantage of the state's favourable trust laws. Ewen emerged as the company's largest shareholder and first president. In 1908, a year after Ewen's death at age 74, the company purchased the Clover Leaf brand and began selling its canned salmon under the newly acquired trademark. Clover Leaf had been introduced in Canada in 1889 by the Anglo-American Packing Company to sell canned mackerel, among other products. In 1928, the British Columbia Packers' Association merged with Gosse Packing Company Ltd. and was federally incorporated in Canada as British Columbia Packers Limited (BC Packers). The consolidated entity consisted of 44 canneries, three cold storage facilities, five plants and shipyards, two salteries and more than 100 fishing boats, packers and coastal tenders. Up until 1945, BC Packer's fishery operations were focused on the British Columbia Coast. Post World War II, the company expanded rapidly, opening new Canadian facilities in Ontario and Atlantic Canada and foreign facilities in coastal areas of the United States, Mexico and Southeast Asia. In 1962, George Weston Limited acquired BC Packers and its Clover Leaf brand. Five years later, in 1967, it also acquired Connors Bros., makers of Brunswick Sardines and Seafood Snacks. The end of the 20th century and the first decade of the new millennium brought a number of ownership changes for Clover Leaf. In 1998, George Weston sold the Clover Leaf brand and associated trademarks to International Home Foods, which established Clover Leaf Seafoods as a separate legal entity. Shortly thereafter, International Home Foods rolled Clover Leaf into its U.S. canned seafood division, Bumble Bee. Subsequently, in 2001, ConAgra purchased International Home Foods, acquiring the Clover Leaf/Bumble Bee seafood division as part of the transaction. In 2003, ConAgra sold the division to a senior management group. A year later, Clover Leaf/Bumble Bee merged with Connors Bros. to create Connors Bros. Income Fund, North America's largest branded-seafood company. In 2008, Connors Bros. was acquired by U.S. private equity firm Centre Partners. In 2010, Centre Partners sold Connors Bros. to British private-equity firm Lion Capital LLP.

The game consists of a player controlling one of two factions, and their main mission is to defeat the enemy faction to secure the planet's resources. Its development started in 1996 and lasted for three years, with developers working mostly on summer. Although the project was incomplete, it became the first game to win the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival of 1999. The development team invested time, but no money into the project. However, the game was later cancelled indefinitely. There has since been unlikely plans of a future port, using a modern engine.  Gameplay  Fire and Darkness is a real-time strategy video game played from a three-dimensional perspective. The player controls one of two factions, and their main mission is to defeat the enemy faction to secure the planet's resources. To accomplish this mission, the player spends resources (defined in-game as terajoules) to build combat units and facilities used to engage in war against their opponents, or to produce more resources. According to the demo released by Singularity Software, five planets were featured in the game, and both factions shared the same type of combat units and facilities.Fire and Darkness (demo). Singularity Software. 1999. The game incorporates a player-controlled camera system that can be rotated and zoomed at will; this allows the player to view the world from above, from the ground, or anywhere in between. Combat units (both ground units and aircraft) have inertia incorporated into their physics programming, although it lacks polygon-level collision detection for every object. The player can make their units move anywhere in the map, given that Fire and Darkness is not designed using a grid-like system like other contemporary games such as Warcraft II.  Development  Fire and Darkness was developed by Singularity Software, an American studio composed of seven individuals. David Scherer, Adam Stubblefield and David Rosenthal started working on the game as early as 1996, with Mark Feghali helping them craft the networking engine featured in the game. Ari Heitner later joined the team, focusing on the game's user interface, sound code and scenario design. Ian Dale served as the main artist of the game, and Austin Huang provided the music. According to Scherer and Rosenthal, the game was done within three years, with the team mostly working in summer given that all of them attended either high school or college. According to Next Generation magazine, no money was spent producing the game. Despite its three-year development cycle, Fire and Darkness was not completed, and therefore never released. David Rosenthal commented after winning the Seumas McNally Grand Prize that the game was \\"sitting on a hard disk taking up bits\\". However, Rosenthal mentioned that he thought about developing a port of the game as a multiplayer real-time strategy game for tablets.  Reception  Fire and Darkness became the first game win to the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival of 1999. It also received the Audience Choice award. Next Generation named it a \\"kind of hybrid between Myth and Total Annihilation\\".

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was torpedoed and sunk in May 1944, the only River-class frigate lost by the RCN. She was named for Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Quebec. Valleyfield was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942–1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 30 November 1942 by Morton Engineering and Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City and launched 17 July 1943. She was commissioned into the RCN on 7 December 1943 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of Valleyfield, they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Valleyfield in harbour War service After beginning in St. Margaret's Bay, Valleyfield completed working up in Bermuda. Upon her return in February 1944, she was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-1 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. While en route to joining her group in the United Kingdom, she was detached to escort the convoy rescue ship Dundee and her tug to Horta in the Azores. From Horta, Valleyfield escorted and her tug to the United Kingdom. Valleyfield then made one more round-trip before her sinking. =Sinking= After parting company with convoy ONM 234 on 7 May 1944, escort group C-1 was making their way to St. John's when fired two GNATs, acoustic torpedoes, at the five ships. One of the torpedoes hit the port side boiler room on Valleyfield, splitting her in two. She sank in under four minutes. She had been travelling astern of the group and it took some time for the rest of the escorts to realize that Valleyfield had been sunk. Valleyfield and escort group C-1 had not been zig-zagging for several hours even though the conditions for attack by submarine were favourable.Lamb, James B. (1987). On the Triangle Run. Totem. p. 147. . Eventually returned to pick up survivors while the other members of the group , and searched unsuccessfully for the U-boat. 43 survivors were rescued from the water, of whom 5 died later. Some criticism was directed at Giffard which, though following procedure at the time, had hesitated before rescuing survivors. This may have increased the number of casualties.

A laser pulse incident onto the cathode of a photoinjector drives electrons out of it, and into the accelerating field of the electron gun. In comparison with the widespread thermionic electron gun, photoinjectors produce electron beams of higher brightness, which means more particles packed into smaller volume of phase space (beam emittance). Photoinjectors serve as the main electron source for single-pass synchrotron light sources, such as free-electron lasers and for ultrafast electron diffraction setups. The first RF photoinjector was developed in 1985 at Los Alamos National Laboratory and used as the source for a free-electron-laser experiment. High-brightness electron beams produced by photoinjectors are used directly or indirectly to probe the molecular, atomic and nuclear structure of matter for fundamental research, as well as material characterization. A photoinjector comprises a photocathode, electron gun (AC or DC), power supplies, driving laser system, timing and synchronization system, emittance compensation magnets. It can include vacuum system and cathode fabrication or transport system. It is usually followed by beam diagnostics and higher-energy accelerators. linear accelerator works. For a photoinjector, the source S is the cathode inside the fractional cell, followed by four booster cells of RF field. The key component of a photoinjector is a photocathode, which is located inside the cavity of electron gun (usually, a 0.6-fractional cell for optimal distribution of accelerating field). Extracted electron beam suffers from its own space-charge fields that deteriorate the beam brightness. For that reason, photoelectron guns often have one or more full-size booster cells to increase the beam energy and reduce the space-charge effect. The gun's accelerating field is RF (radio-frequency) wave provided by a klystron or other RF power source. For low-energy beams, such as ones used in electron diffraction and microscopy, electrostatic acceleration (DC) is a suitable. The photoemission on the cathode is initiated by an incident pulse from the driving laser. Depending on the material of the photocathode, the laser wavelength can vary from 1700 nm (infrared) down to 100-200 nm (ultraviolet). Emission from the cavity wall is possible with laser wavelength of about 250 nm for copper walls or cathodes. Semiconductor cathodes are often sensitive to ambient conditions and might require a clean preparation chamber located behind the photoelectron gun. The optical system of the driving laser is often designed to control the pulse structure, and consequently, the distribution of electrons in the extracted bunch. For example, a fs-scale laser pulse with an elliptical transverse profile creates a thin \\"pancake\\" electron bunch, that evolves into a uniformly filled ellipsoid under its own space-charge fields. A more sophisticated laser pulse with a comb-like longitudinal profile generates a similarly shaped, comb electron beam.

SR 675 (1937–1962) SR 675 was the name for what is now SR 685. Created in 1937, the route always started at SR 216 in Buchtel and ran east for to SR 13 in Trimble Township, south of Jacksonville. The entire route was located in Athens County. The route would remain unchanged until 1962 when the route number was changed from 675 to 685 due to the creation of Interstate 675 in Dayton. SR 680 (1937–1962) SR 680 was the former designation for SR 681 from 1937 until 1962. SR 680 was created on a road from SR 356 near Mineral to SR 7 at the Ohio River in Reedsville via Albany and Darwin. No changes occurred to the routing until 1962 when it was renumbered to SR 681 to avoid the duplication with the newly-designated Interstate 680 near Youngstown. SR 686 SR 686 was a state route in Stark County connecting SR 93 in Lawrence Township to US 21 in northern Massillon. The route existed from 1937 until 1941 when it was replaced by Stark County Road 348, also called Orrville Street NW. SR 692 SR 692 was a state route in Scipio Township connecting SR 143 between Walsh and Harrisonville to SR 680 (later SR 681) north of Pageville. The route also intersected SR 684 at SR 684's northern terminus in Pageville. The route existed from 1937 until December 2013 when most of the route was transferred to Meigs County jurisdiction. North of SR 684, the road became a part of SR 684. SR 695 SR 695 was a short-lived state route serving as the main road through the Belmont County community of Lloydsville. Prior to 1939, US 40 ran through the town, but in 1939 a bypass was built north of the community. SR 695 was designated onto the old main road when US 40 was moved to the bypass. Within one year, SR 695 was replaced by US 40 Alternate, a designation that would last until the 1960s. SR 699 SR 699 was a state highway entirely in Wyandot County in existence from 1937 until 1996. From 1937 until 1964, SR 699 started in Marseilles Township at SR 37 and ran due north past SR 294, SR 53, and the village of Kirby to end at US 30N. After 1965, SR 699 was shortened to run only between SR 53 and US 30N (later US 30) serving Kirby. The route was deleted in 1996 when it was replaced by SR 293 which had formerly been a spur route from US 30 to the village of Wharton. SR 702 SR 702 was a short state highway spur from SR 235 to Turkeyfoot Point on the Indian Lake shoreline entirely in Stokes Township, Logan County. The route was designated in 1940 and remained on this alignment until 1977. Today, the former state route is a township-maintained road (T-293). SR 704 SR 704 was the designation for what is now SR 81 between Willshire and Lima from 1937 until 1939. The route was replaced by SR 81 which formerly ended in Ada when it was extended through Lima. SR 714 SR 714 was the designation for SR 814 prior to 1983. First designated in 1937, SR 714 always ran from US 36 in Union Township to SR 290 (later SR 296) in Salem Township. The route was entirely in Champaign County. After 1983, the route designation was renumbered to SR 814. SR 723 (1939–1945) SR 723 was a state highway in Warren and Clinton Counties in central Ohio. The route started in Harveysburg at SR 73 and ran north to SR 380 near New Burlington. The entire route generally followed the Caesar Creek between its two ends. The route existed from 1939 until 1945 when it became a local road. Today, part of the road is under water as the Caesar Creek Lake was filled in the 1970s as a part of the creation of Caesar Creek State Park. SR 751 (1937–1959) SR 751 was a state highway in and around the eastern side of Columbus. When it was first designated in 1937, the route was about and ran from US 40 to SR 16, paralleling the Big Walnut Creek for its entire length. Two years later, SR 751 was extended south to US 33 southeast of the city bringing the total length to . Again, the entire route closely followed Big Walnut Creek. The route was deleted after 1959 being replaced by mostly local roads as by the time of its deletion, most of the land through which SR 751 passed through had been incorporated. SR 773 SR 773 was the designation for what is now SR 162 between Rochester and Akron in 1937. After one year signed, the entire route was replaced by SR 162, which during the time of SR 773's existence, had its eastern terminus in New London. SR 162 was routed over a new road between New London and Rochester to connect to SR 773 and continue to Akron. SR 780 SR 780 was a state route in Highland County. The route began at SR 134 in the Salem Township community of Harwood and ran northeast and east to SR 138 in the Hamer Township community of Danville. SR 780 was designated in 1937 and fully paved by 1941. After 1946, SR 131 was extended from its former end in Vera Cruz taking over the entire length of SR 780. SR 782 SR 782 was a state-maintained section of Sandusky Street in Downtown Columbus. The route started at West Broad Street (which carried US 40, US 62, and SR 3) and traveled north to US 33 (Dublin Road). When the route was created around 1949, the northern terminus was at an intersection with US 33, but by 1955 the northern terminus was reconstructed to an interchange. The route was still in existence in 1957, but later the right-of-way of Sandusky Street was obliterated by the construction of the West Innerbelt (first a section of Interstate 71, now a part of SR 315). External links *The Spring-Sandusky Interchange SR 791 SR 791 was a state route in and around Canton along Raff Road between an intersection with Navarre Road (US 62) and Canton-Massillon Road in Canton Township to Tuscarawas Street (US 30) in Canton. The route was created in 1946. Following the completion of the US 30 / US 62 freeway through Canton, the route at SR 791's northern terminus became SR 172 but the route's southern terminus remained at what used to be the Navarre Road intersection. 1976 was the last year SR 791 appeared on the official Ohio highway map, but the route remained in the Stark County traffic logs through 1988. SR 793 (1937) SR 793 was a state route located in northwestern Columbus for one year, 1937. Until 1937, the route that SR 793 would follow was signed as SR 31. In 1937, SR 31 switched the route it used to enter Columbus; SR 31 headed south to US 40 while SR 793 was routed from Marble Cliff to northwestern Columbus at US 23. Within one year, SR 31 was back on its original alignment, this time co-signed with the newly-signed US 33. SR 793 (1959–2006) SR 793 was a spur to the Southeastern Ohio Training Center (also called the Boys' Industrial School and the Fairfield School for Boys) in Hocking Township, Fairfield County to the city of Lancaster. The route started at the entrance to the training center and traveled north for to an interchange at South Memorial Drive, which carried US 33 during the time of SR 793's existence. SR 793 was designated in 1959 and had its jurisdiction transferred to Fairfield County and Lancaster City on May 23, 2006. The section of the route within the city is now only called South Broad Street while the former route outside of it is called Fairfield County Road 90. SR 794 (1937–1942) SR 794 was the designation for a state-maintained section of Washingtonville Road and short portion of Western Reserve Road in southern Mahoning County. The route started in Washingtonville at SR 14 (which straddled the Mahoning–Columbiana County line) and traveled north through Green Township before reaching a T-intersection with Western Reserve Road on the Green-Canfield Township. SR 794 then traveled east to end at a nearby intersection with SR 46 in the community of Marquis. The route was created in 1937 as a dirt road and was paved within one year. SR 794 was decommissioned between 1942 and 1945 and replaced by Mahoning County Road 95 (the north-south portion) and CR 32 (the Western Reserve Road portion). SR 794 (1950–2013) SR 794 was a route in Green Township, Clark County serving the Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport and the Springfield Air National Guard Base. The route, created in 1950, connected US 68 and SR 72 south of Springfield. It remained in existence until 2013 when the route and a new alignment built around the National Guard Base was transferred to Clark County jurisdiction. SR 796 SR 796 was the designation for a former segment of SR 31 through the Good Hope Township community of Rockbridge. In 1938, SR 31 was replaced by US 33 southeast of Columbus; as a part of this renumbering, a bypass of Rockbridge was built. SR 796 was assigned on the former two-lane road through the area. The route would remain along this alignment until 1964 when it was removed in conjunction with the construction of the US 33 expressway through the county. All of the former route along Rockbridge Road A, Main Street, and Jackson Street is now known as Hocking County Road 10. SR 797 (1939–1941) SR 797 was a state route in Portage County connecting SR 43 in Franklin Township (just north of Kent to SR 82 in the Mantua Center section of Mantua Township. Throughout its history from 1939 until 1941, the portion of the route between SR 43 and SR 14 was asphalt- paved, the section between SR 14 and SR 303 including its concurrency with it was gravel-paved, between SR 303 and halfway to Mantua Center was a dirt road, and the remainder was gravel. Today, most of the former route is called Diagonal Road and Portage County Road 155, though the latter is not designated through the portion that is now part of incorporated Streetsboro. SR 797 (1946–2014) SR 797 was a route in Perry Township, Muskingum County that served the Zanesville Municipal Airport about east of the city of Zanesville. It was initially created in 1946 running from the airport's entrance to an intersection with US 22 and US 40. In 1965, with the completion of Interstate 70 in the area, SR 797 was extended north about . The total length of the route was from the time of the extension until 2003. That year, the portion south of US 22/US 40 was transferred to county jurisdiction with the short remainder of the route between US 22/US 40 and I-70 becoming county-maintained by 2014.\\"Straight-Line Diagrams County Update Table (Muskingum County, 2006)\\". Ohio Department of Transportation. SR 798 SR 798 was a state route in Belmont County connecting SR 647 and the northern city limits of Martins Ferry at SR 7. The route ran through mostly hilly terrain between its two termini. The route was first signed in 1939 and last appeared on the Ohio state highway map in 1978 but the route did appear in the 1980 Belmont County traffic report. Today the former SR 798 is a part of Deep Run Road (Belmont County Road 2) and Nixon Run Road (CR 16). SR 824 SR 824 was the designation for the road connecting SR 338 and the West Virginia state line near Ravenswood in Lebanon Township, Meigs County. The route included the Ohio portion of the Ravenswood Bridge over the Ohio River. The route was signed in 1981 upon the opening of the bridge and was in existence until 2003 when the bridge became a part of the rerouted US 33 through Meigs County.

AIEN Executive Presidency Wachuku serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of AIEN: Agriculture and Industrial Entrepreneurs of Nigeria. This Association upholds Nigeria and African Union's Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want; adopted on 31 January 2015 at the 24th Ordinary Assembly of Heads of State and Governments of African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; especially Agenda 2063's Flagship Project 2 concerning: \\"formulation of a strategy for transforming the African economy from a supplier of raw materials to one that actively uses its own resources.\\" Also, Wachuku's AIEN: Agriculture and Industrial Entrepreneurs of Nigeria uplifts and adheres to all Global Goals: Agenda 2030, SDGs: Sustainable Development Goals of United Nations; basically SDG 2 on Zero Hunger: \\"End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture;\\" an agenda comprising 17 global goals created to be a \\"blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all\\" humankind and our planet; started in 2015 by United Nations General Assembly as a component of United Nations Resolution 70/1; and targeted to be achieved by 2030. In 2018, Wachuku led AIEN: Agriculture and Industrial Entrepreneurs of Nigeria launched an initiative called Agricultural and Industrial Clusters in all 774 Local Government Areas of Nigeria, to create jobs and sustainable agriculture and viable means of livelihoods. With the RMRDC: Raw Materials Research and Development Council, Wachuku's AIEN signed a US$41 million (₦15 billion Naira) MoU: Memorandum of Understanding to fast-track agricultural industrialization, and availability of raw materials to boost sustainable agriculture, soil improvement, crop yield, innovation, agri-business, jobs creation, manufacturing, climate friendly, green, renewable farming methods, nutrition and food security in Nigeria. NASSI Presidency Wachuku's daily mission in caring servant leadership, during his service as National President of Nigerian Association of Small Scale Industrialists was proactively helping to grow the Nigerian economy. This was aimed towards poverty eradication among the citizens, and also protecting the interests of all marginalized small scale businesses. He made it an unwavering point of presidential calling to make sure that ideals for NASSI's existence were upheld and result oriented. Established in 1978, NASSI: Nigerian Association of Small Scale Industrialists was meant to cater for the needs of the small scale business industrialist through the provision of social, political and economic support for its members. NASSI organises knowledge transfer workshops, conferences, exhibitions, trade-fairs and study tours, including the provision of advisory services for all relevant groups and individuals in business. Also, the association provides information on required global manufacturing standards, sources of raw materials, market situations, available plants and equipment. NASSI grants micro credit facilities to members and sometimes stands as sureties for verified and trusted SMEs in their relationship with finance institutions. The association connects its members to diverse opportunities within Nigeria and internationally. Serving as a strong advocate for its members against disadvantageous public policies is, also, part of the work of NASSI. =Guarantee project= In March 2011, Wachuku announced in Lagos, that NASSI was launching a guaranteed project of action for its member firms, saying that the program was aimed at filling gaps for members who lacked collateral to support their credit proposals to banks. He affirmed that NASSI would work out the critical minimum requirement for accessing credit by small industries, emphasising that NASSI was already looking at ways of accessing the US$1.2 billion or ₦200 billion naira SMSEs: Small and Medium Scale Enterprises fund put up by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Wachuku stated: \\"I want to make sure that government understands that the engine of growth of any economy rests on SMEs. It is my duty to initiate and tell people that the policy direction of NASSI is to make loans available to SMEs. I want to ensure that lack of collateral by our members is addressed such that concessionary interest rate is given to small scale borrowers.\\" =NERFUND agreement= In December 2011, Wachuku led NASSI to go into favorable agreement with Nigeria's National Economic Reconstruction Fund (NERFUND), to help finance projects for NASSI members. A memorandum of understanding was signed between the Managing Director of NERFUND, Alhaji Baba Maina Gimba and Wachuku. Under the agreement, NASSI was required to present projects that needed funding to NERFUND, accordingly, NERFUND was to evaluate and disburse helpful funds; as well as insuring all business deals. At the signing ceremony, Wachuku questioned “a country of 167 million people with some 59 million small scale industries, having only three functional Development Finance Institutions (DFIs)\\", stating that it was clearly inadequate, and calling for more DFIs. =Stable power espousal= Strategically, Wachuku has always pushed for the realization of stable power supply in Nigeria; maintaining that since the 1999 arrival of democracy in the country, many companies have been operating below capacity because of unstable power supply, insufficient financial resources and alarming labor costs. He stated that gross inadequate power supply has increased businesses' expenses, reduced productivity and stunted economic growth in Nigeria, forcing the closure of many companies or/and relocation of some others to neighboring countries. Wachuku pointed out that: \\"blackouts are negatively impacting the economy, which is grappling with a combination of slow growth, a weak currency, high inflation and the effect of flooding that is expected to drive up food prices.\\" Chuku Wachuku as Director-General: National Directorate of Employment: Nigeria =Jobs for youths advocacy= Making sure that government upholds conducive ways and capacities for the private sector to empower and create jobs for the youth in Nigeria has been one of Wachuku's abiding principles of service. In a November 2011 lecture titled: Investment Climate: What is the Weather in Nigeria, presented at Ikeja, Lagos based SOFFE: Sam Ohuabunwa Foundation for Economic Empowerment , Wachuku reflected on his vision and mission of creating jobs for Nigerian youths. According to him, \\"the private sector should be given more autonomy to direct matters that deal directly with youth empowerment and job creation. In this regard, NASSI will lead a networking initiative that will include value chain-related organisations along with states and local governments. NASSI will, through this partnership, adequately address issues and factors that militate against the growth of SMEIs and work out positive and workable frameworks that will once and for all ensure the growth of SMEIs. Government can not create jobs in a sustainable way. There is need to boost production and ensure that small-scale industries contribute 90 to 95 per cent to GDP. That is why I ask you, can government actually create jobs? To this particular question, my answer is no! And I speak as an expert on this matter. The other sustainable way I know is to create a powerful private sector-driven entrepreneurial base, propelled and predicated on small and medium scale industries and the informal sector.\\" Again, in a June 2012 interview by Nigeria's Vanguard Daily Newspaper, Wachuku stressed the crucial need for jobs and youth empowerment, in the following words: \\"Nigeria needs to create not less than five million jobs yearly to meet employment needs of her growing population.\\" =SMEs and banks= With objective consistency, Wachuku has usually let the world know that Nigerian banks pay \\"lip service\\" towards effectively funding SMEs: Small and Medium Enterprises in the so-called \\"giant\\" African country. He maintains that, in any nation, banks should be helpful partners in sustainable economic development to the viable benefit of emerging businesses and general population. In a February 2014 interview he granted The Punch, Wachuku stated: \\"We want to add value through skills acquisition. But in doing this, we have found out that the main problem is getting finance at affordable interest rates. The Federal Government talks about this and banks also talk about it. But I want to state here that Nigerian banks have not been helpful. They always say money is available. Where is the money? There is no small scale industrialist who walks into a bank and gets a loan. It is difficult for SMEs to get loans from banks because they always demand for collaterals. The collateral they ask for is over and above the worth of the loan. So, banks are not keen on lending to small scale businesses at all. They say this sub-sector is risk infested. They may claim that they have given some amount of money as loans to SMEs; but you will find out that this is not true. For instance, what can a loan that is given to 2,000 people in a nation of about 167 million people do? The last statistics conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that there were about 17 million small scale industrialists in Nigeria and you are talking about empowering 2,000 people with loans. What is that? So, Nigerian banks are paying lip service to funding SMEs.\\" =CBN Governor= As a respected financial expert and constructive economist, Wachuku was, in February 2014, called on by the media to comment on President Goodluck Jonathan's suspension of Central Bank of Nigeria's governor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. He shared his economic and political view as follows: \\"Sanusi should not have been publicly singing a different tune from that of the President. As a senior government official who has done an outstanding job in the country’s banking sector, what he should have done was talk to his principal and advise him in private. It was wrong for him to rush to the media to sing divergent tunes. No president anywhere in the world will allow that. However, Sanusi's suspension is likely to create micro-economic distortions and cause some shivers in the economy.\\" =First Bank MoU= In October 2012, Wachuku concluded Memorandum of Understanding arrangements for a new SMEs funding program between Nigerian Association of Small Scale Industrialists and First Bank of Nigeria. Concerning the new program, Wachuku explained: \\"lack of access to loan-able funds at cheap and profitable interest rates had been the bane of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises in the country. I commend First bank of Nigeria for their trail-blazing action. Before we got to First Bank, we had approached a number of banks, but their concern was primarily and solely the profit motif. It is, therefore, a major achievement that First Bank, as the leading bank, truly, agreed to our proposal. This gesture from First Bank is one laced with patriotic zeal, as it had the potential to revolutionize operations of small scale industrialists, and by extension the economy of Nigeria as a whole. The current Group Managing Director of the bank, Mr. Bisi Onasanya, gave unqualified support to the project. Onasanya saw it as a key corporate social responsibility activity with multiplier effects on the economy.The government itself agreed that the private sector contributes about 90 per cent to the nation's Gross Domestic Product. With SMEs forming about 65 per cent of private sector operations, one can only imagine what effects this new move by the First Bank will be on the economy.\\" Continuing, he said \\"banks in the country, for a long time, had been part of the problem of the real sector, saying they would rather get involved in round-tripping and short-term lending for commercial activities, than to lend to businesses with manufacturing operations. It is in this light that the new twist is commendable of emulation by other banks. First Bank, through its current General Managing Director, has shown an unusual disposition to the plight of small scale industrialists. I think Mr. Onasanya deserves all kudos.\\" Family of Chuku Chief: Mrs. Ngozi Wachuku: Wife of Chief Chuku Wachuku Late High Chief, Mrs. Lilly Wachuku, was the mother of Chukumere Anaba Ndubuisi Wachuku, and his siblings: Obimndi Wachuku, Nne Wachuku, Mrs. Nne Stanley Onyemerekeya, Okey Wachuku and Anaba Wachuku.

The film stars Kate Bosworth, Thomas Jane, Jacob Tremblay, Annabeth Gish, and Dash Mihok. Before I Wake had its world premiere at Fantasia on July 31, 2016 and was theatrically released in the United States on January 5, 2018, by Netflix. The film grossed over $4.9 million worldwide and received favourable reviews from critics, with many praising the performances, visual effects and the horror elements, but criticism for its screenplay and characters.  Plot  A frightened man with a gun enters a child's room nervously. He looks around as if expecting something to reveal itself in the shadows, when a sudden commotion makes him pull the trigger. The gunfire awakens the child and the man breaks down in tears. Later, Jessie and Mark Hobson take in a foster child, eight-year-old Cody Morgan, after their young son Sean dies from accidentally drowning in the bathtub. On his first night, before Cody goes to sleep, he reveals to Jessie about the nightmarish creature called \\"the Canker Man\\" to which Jessie brushes it off and tells Cody that it’s only a bad dream and it can't do any real damage. Later that night, the two are amazed as multicolored butterflies flutter across the living room, emitting a strong glow. Mark tries to capture a blue butterfly to show to Cody, as he has a liking for butterflies. However, Cody wakes up and the butterflies disappear. The next day at school, he befriends a girl name Annie and antagonizes a mean student. At home, Cody asks Mark who the child in the picture is, and Mark replies that he is their dead son, Sean. Cody answers that his mom is dead, too. That night, the couple see their deceased child and try to hug him. When Cody wakes up, Sean disappears. Upon discovering Cody's gift of making his dreams become reality, Jessie takes advantage of it. She lets Cody watch home videos of Sean and, that night, the couple once again sees their beloved child. Days later, Mark accuses his wife of using Cody for his gift instead of loving him. After the argument, Mark takes down the pictures of Sean. Cody falls asleep at school, and \\"the Canker Man\\" appears before the mean child, as Annie watches in horror and screams, waking him up. Meanwhile, Jessie goes to a doctor and complains that her foster child has trouble sleeping; the doctor prescribes medication. She mixes it with Cody's drink, unbeknownst to her husband. That night Sean once again appears before them but turns into a nightmare. Mark attempts to wake Cody up but can not. Jessie confesses that she drugged him. The nightmare creature devours Mark as Jessie is thrown across the room and falls unconscious. She wakes up with Cody on the phone calling 911 for help. Suspecting domestic violence and that the boy has been drugged, social services takes Cody away to an orphanage. Jessie steals Cody's social worker's files and talks to his former foster parent, the man from the beginning named Whelan Young as he tells Jessie about what happened to his wife being killed the same way Mark was killed. Whelan tells her that the only way to stop Cody's nightmares is to put an end to Cody himself. Jessie objects to this and goes to the orphanage to find Cody. At the orphanage, the staff have noticed that Cody has not been sleeping for the past two days. That night, the boy is given a tranquilizer, which he protests against helplessly. Jessie arrives to find the place dark and isolated. She sees nightmarish creatures in every room. Finally, she finds Cody, but before she can go near him, she is thrown across the hallway by one of the creatures. She pulls out a pillow shaped like a blue butterfly, and hugs the creature. As she holds it, it takes the form of Cody and disappears. Before it disappears, she whispers to him and asks him to release all the people the creatures have taken. The nightmare turns into a beautiful dream, and all the people taken by \\"the Canker Man\\" reappear, though only as dreams themselves. Jessie takes the- still unconscious Cody home. The following day, Jessie gives Cody the journal his birth mother Andrea had kept, which shows how much she had loved him and his gift. However, she had died of pancreatic cancer when Cody was just three years old. It is revealed that \\"the Canker Man\\" is actually his mother when she had cancer, but Cody had read the journal wrong and thought a monster had taken over his mother because of what the chemotherapy had done to her. Then she tells him that there is more to his recurring nightmares than meets the eye, and Cody begins to learn how to control his gift.

The former settlement was located along Water Hole Creek not far from the site of Preston, another ghost town. During the American Civil War, the town provided soldiers to the Confederate States Army as well as a Home Guard unit. Waterville had a post office intermittently between 1859 and 1880. Local residents attempted to restart postal service in 1883 but it was permanently stopped the following year. History The settlement of Waterville sprang up along Water Hole Creek near a place called Will's Water Hole. In January 1859 a post office was set up in the community. Waterville was near Preston in southeast Wharton County. The town was situated along a major trail from Matagorda on the Gulf of Mexico and San Felipe on the Brazos River. In the Civil War, Waterville raised a company of soldiers for the Confederate Army called the \\"Rough and Ready Mounted Rifles\\" under Captain C. F. Whittington. In 1861 there were 27 men enrolled but the number expanded to 39 the following year. In 1862 the town was the headquarters for Colonel Reuben R. Brown's 33rd Texas Cavalry Regiment. Waterville's Home Guard unit numbered 49 men in 1862 but 18 of the men had no firearms. The available weapons were a motley collection of nine rifles, 12 shotguns and five pistols. Postal service was discontinued in 1867, restarted in 1872 and stopped again in 1880. In 1883 a new application was submitted for postal service. Evidently there were too few residents because in August 1884 postal service was stopped and never revived. Geography The 1883 postal application located Waterville on a direct line between Wharton and Pledger. The site was from Wharton and from Pledger. Five- ninths of the distance along a straight line drawn on a map between Wharton and Pledger places Waterville very close to Farm to Market Road 1096 and Water Hole Creek. There are turf farms nearby.

Description  Liopropoma carmabi constitute a size that is smaller than most Liopropoma species and remain small, with a body length that can range up to 6.0 centimeters.Encyclopedia of Life, https://www.eol.org/pages/205931/details Typically, males on average extend to 5.1 cm and females to 4.45 cm.Joshi, Sanjay. “Fish Tales: Candy Basslet Courting ” Reefs magazine, 2011, https://reefs.com/magazine/courtship-and- possible-spawning-of-the-candy-basslet-liopropoma-carmabi/ L. carmabi are found to have approximately 67 dorsal spines and 1,213 dorsal soft rays. The head, body, and caudal fin of the candy basslet houses horizontal orange and lavender stripes, separated by red lines, giving it a defined vignette, thus signifying why the species chooses a secretive fashion of housing. They also embody a typical torpedo shaped body, one that is common among Liopropoma species.Schiemer, Gregory. “Aquarium Fish: The Candy Basslet (Liopropoma carmabi (Randall, 1963)) ” Advanced Aquarist, Oct. 2006, www.advancedaquarist.com/2006/10/fish  Distribution  Liopropoma carmabi is one of five species of Liopropoma that reside in the deep waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the Florida Keys, and along the eastern Caribbean, to as far as the northern coast of South America. It is most commonly found near the island of Curacao.The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, www.iucnredlist.org/details/16759167/0  Taxonomy  The candy basslet is part of the family Serranidae (sea bass, groupers and reef basslets). It's one of 37 species of reef basslets in the tribe Liopropomini. L. carmabi houses many similarities with two other Lioporpoma species; the Swissguard Basslet (L. rubre) and the Swales Basslet (L. swalisi), including size and coloration. However, its more defined and intense phenotypic coating can easily differentiate it from the other two.  Habitat and ecology  The species is widely distributed in the mentioned areas above. They are most notable for their cryptic style of living, and thus prefer to situate in deeper habitats. The closest distance they are found to live near the surface is at 25m below, and they can live as deep as 100m from the surface. L. carmabi are commonly found over rocky reefs, especially areas with more minimally sized corals, and instead rich rock shelter and rubble. This particular species of fish also accustom to living at a mean temperature of 27 degrees Celsius. Commercially, due to their defined and appealing phenotype, aquarium trade is desirable but rare, because of the difficulty to reach their deep habitats.  Reproductive behavior  In shadier environments, or environments that cater to being more secretive, the species are prone to swim in a manner where both sexes are traveling in parallel to each other with their operculum's in contact. This behavior indicates courtship between the two sexes, and spawning takes place: an external mode of zygote fertilization.  Diet  Feeding behavior of L. carmabi usually includes crustaceans such as brine shrimps and crabs that are of a small enough size to fit in the basslet's relatively small mouth. Candy basslets also consume other meaty seafood such as krill.  Conservation  The invasive lionfish, Pterois, is known to prey on candy basslets, but the extent of this threat has not been determined. Due to unknown major threats, and the wide distribution of the species across the tropical Atlantic, it is listed under Least Concern when categorizing the endangerment of species.

The sport is played by both men and women teams.  Gameplay  Ringball is a non- contact sporthttp://www.topendsports.com/sport/more/ringball.htm played by both men and women teams in separate games. It is similar to the game of netball,korfball and can be played on an all weather, grass, or in-door court. The court is divided into three sections. A team consists of three goal scorers, three centre players, and three defending players. The objective of the game is to throw the ball from one player to another and finally through the ring or hoop of the goalpost. A goalpost is placed at both ends of the court.Starting positions of players on a Ringball court. The red player in the semicircle holds the ball. The South African game of ringball is played by two opposing teams consisting of nine (9) players on a side. Three players of each team play in each of the three sections of the court (three (3) goal shooters, three (3) centre players and three (3) defenders). These players may at no time during play, touch ground in any adjacent section, step on or receive the ball over the lines separating the sections. The ball is passed through the air from player to player and is caught with the hands, such that the ball does not touch any other part of the body. In passing the ball, a player may not move forward or backward, feint a pass, or be in possession of the ball for longer than two (2) seconds during the attempt to pass the ball. To score, the ball must fall through the ring from above. A goal shooter may attempt to score a goal from any position in the goal section and outside the semicircle. Both hands (from below upwards) must be used when shooting a goal and must be attempted within five (5) seconds from the time the ball is received. When a penalty goal has been awarded, any of the three opposing goal shooters can attempt a goal from any position outside the goal circle. A penalty goal must be attempted within three (3) seconds. A goal shooter can also attempt a penalty from behind the penalty line within three (3) seconds. Players may try to gain possession of the ball without hitting or snatching the ball from the opponent's hands. Players are not allowed to hold, push away or obstruct their opponents in any manner to prevent them from passing the ball. Two (2) players of the same team may not touch or hold the ball simultaneously. It is an infringement if the ball crosses the section without being touched by a player in that section. When players of both teams commit a transgression simultaneously, it is called a double fault. The referee then tosses the ball into the air between two opposing players where the transgressions occurred. The two opposing players then attempt to gain possession of the ball by hitting or catching the ball on the descend. A match consists of two-halves of 25 minutes each with an interval of three (3) minutes. After each successful goal, the players must take up position as shown on the image. The centre player stands in the half circle facing his own goalpost. At the blow of the whistle the ball must be passed to one of the wings within two (2) seconds. It is an infringement when the ball is passed to another section without passing to a wing first. When the ball goes out of play crossing the outside lines, an opposing player from that section puts the ball into play on the spot where it has left the court. The team with the highest score at the end of the match is the winning team.  Rules  =The Court= 1\\\\. The courtRingball South Africa – Rules of the game, updated April 2016.

The unknown creator or creators use the pseudonym Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson (or Odinsson). They stated that they planned to distribute half of auroracoins that would ever be created to all 330,000 people listed in Iceland's national ID database beginning on March 25, 2014, free of charge, coming out to 31.8 auroracoins per person. Auroracoin was created as an alternative currency to address the government restrictions on Iceland's króna, in place since 2008, which severely restricts movement of the currency outside the country. History It has been suggested that 'in many ways, Iceland could be seen as an ideal place for a virtual currency' on account of the limited use of cash, extensive familiarity with electronic finance, and extensive interest in Bitcoin in Icelandic society, coupled with the long-term instability of the króna.Richard D.

Phase 1 of the airdrop began on March 25, 2014, with 31.8 AUR being distributed to each claimant. With a USD value of $12.11 per coin on March 24, Icelanders were receiving the equivalent of $385. Price quickly began to fall with the broad issuance of coins. Within one day of the Airdrop launch, approximately 281,000 coins had been distributed and price had dropped nearly 50% versus bitcoin. When phase one of the airdrop had completed on July 24, 2014 it was estimated that 1,126,674 AUR had been disbursed among 35,430 claimants, out of a total Iceland population of 323,002 (2013). The second phase of the airdrop ran from July 25 to November 24, 2014. With the value of AUR having fallen dramatically against the krona the amount per claim was increased to 318 coins. About 5024 claims totalling almost 1.6 million coins were made. The final phase of the airdrop took place from November 25, 2014 to March 24, 2015 with nearly 1.7 million coins being claimed by more than 2600 Icelanders. By this time the price had fallen so sharply that the payout had increased to 636 coins per recipient.

Controversy As of 2015, the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Iceland was unclear, though the Auroracoin airdrop involved government approval of Odinsson's use of the national database of citizens, Íslykill.Joshua R. Hendrickson, Thomas L. Hogan and William J. Luther, 'The Political Economy of Bitcoin', Economic Enquiry, 54 (2016), 925-39, doi:10.1111/ecin.12291. Some Icelandic politicians have taken a negative view of Auroracoin. During a parliamentary debate on March 14, 2014, MP Pétur Blöndal, vice-chair of the Parliament's Economic Affairs and Trade Committee (EATC), emphasized that potential tax evasion through the use of Auroracoin could impact Iceland's economy. He also said that the public should realize that Auroracoin \\"is not a recognized currency since no-one backs the medium\\". MP Frosti Sigurjónsson, a member of the ruling Progressive Party and Chairman of the EATC, suggested in a blog post on his website that there is evidence that Auroracoin is an illegal financial \\"scam\\". Óðinsson said that \\"(parliament) can make it illegal to own or trade Auroracoin, however, they will never be able to control such a decentralized system, or stop Icelanders from using the currency, without turning Iceland into a police state.\\" Between its peak of around 0.1 BTC and November 26, 2017, Auroracoin's value fell to 0.00008027 BTC.

It was one of The New York Times's 100 Most Notable Books of 2012 and a finalist for the 2012 National Book Award. It was awarded the 2012 The Guardian First Book Award, and the 2013 Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award. Background Much of the novel draws upon Powers's experience serving a year as a machine gunner in Mosul and Tal Afar, Iraq, from February 2004 to March 2005 after enlisting in the Army at the age of 17. After his honorable discharge, Powers enrolled in Virginia Commonwealth University, where he graduated in 2008 with a Bachelor's degree in English. He holds an MFA from the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a Michener Fellow in Poetry. Powers has said that the novel took him about four years to write. He also comes from a military family as \\"his father and grandfathers both served, and his uncle was a Marine.\\" With regard to the autobiographical elements of the novel, Powers says: \\"The core of what Bartle goes through, I empathised with it. I felt those things, and asked the same questions: is there anything about this that's redeeming; does asking in itself have value? The story is invented, but there's a definite alignment between his emotional and mental life and mine.\\" Plot The Yellow Birds begins: \\"The war tried to kill us in the spring\\" and follows Pvt. John Bartle, the novel's protagonist and narrator, in Al Tafar, Iraq; Fort Dix, New Jersey; Kaiserslautern, Germany; the author's and narrator's hometown of Richmond, Virginia; and Fort Knox, Kentucky spanning from December 2003 to April 2009. Much of the novel focuses on Bartle's promise to the mother of Murph, a fellow Private, not to let him die in the war. Bartle and Murph also make a pact not to be the 1,000th casualty in the war. The reader learns in the beginning of the novel, however, that Murph dies in the war. The Yellow Birds also examines the reactions of soldiers after their deployments. Bartle enters a state in which he does not want to leave his house upon his return from the war and slowly deteriorates as the novel progresses. Powers has stated: \\"I wanted to show the whole picture. It's not just: you get off the plane, you're back home, everything's fine. Maybe the physical danger ends, but soldiers are still deeply at risk of being injured in a different way. I thought it was important to acknowledge that.\\" The title of the novel alludes to a story Murph tells Bartle while on a guard tower about when Murph's \\"father brought a dozen caged canaries home from the mine and let them loose in the hollow where they lived, how the canaries only flitted and sang awhile before perching back atop their cages, which had been arranged in rows, his father likely thinking that the birds would not return by choice to their captivity, and that the cages should be used for something else: a pretty bed for vegetables, perhaps a place to string up candles between the trees, and in what strange silences the world worked, Murph must have wondered, as the birds settled peaceably in their formation and ceased to sing.\\" Themes For Powers, the epigraph has come to stand for: \\"the lack of control soldiers have over what happens to them. The war proceeds, no matter what you think or do; it's an entity unto itself. You're powerless, and powerlessness itself becomes the enemy. That was my emotional experience of the war. The idea of the bird resonated with the core of what I was trying to get at.\\" One of the major themes of The Yellow Birds is the separation between the American public and soldiers fighting overseas, which has dominated much of the Iraq War. It reflects the idea that Thomas Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum put forward in their book, That Used to Be Us: \\"We have also outsourced sacrifice. If World War II was 'the good war,' and the Korean War 'the forgotten war,' and Vietnam 'the controversial war,' the conflict that began with the attacks of September 11, 2001, and has sent U.S. troops to Afghanistan and Iraq for nearly a decade can be called 'the 1 percent war.' The troops deployed to these combat zones and their immediate families make up less than 1 percent of the population of the United States. The rest of us contribute nothing. We won't even increase our taxes, even through a surcharge on gasoline to pay for these wars. So we end up asking 1 percent of the country to make the ultimate sacrifice and the other 99 percent to make no sacrifice at all.\\" With regard to the lack of connection between U.S. forces and the general public, Powers has said: \\"But I also felt powerful resentment that it seemed like nobody cared that we had gotten into this thing without thinking what the consequences would be...In some ways, the dialogue itself is missing. It seems the public conversation has disappeared. There are still soldiers in Afghanistan right now. There might be a wounded soldier as we speak who is feeling his life slipping away from him. And it doesn’t warrant a mention in some venues. I think that’s tragic.\\" Upon Bartle's return from the war, he encounters a patron at an airport bar who wants to buy him a drink and express his gratitude for Bartle's service. Bartle, however, finds this gesture, like the placement of a yellow ribbon, to be disingenuous and feels guilt when he is congratulated and thanked for his participation in something he sees as immoral. With Bartle's and Murph's pact not to be the 1,000th casualty of the war, The Yellow Birds aims to deconstruct the patriotic narratives of the war like the controversies surrounding the death of Pat Tillman, the prisoner of war Jessica Lynch, and the Mission Accomplished Speech given by President George W. Bush. Bartle also contrasts with the image of a masculine, brave soldier and reflects on his need to prove his masculinity as a reason for enlisting in the Army. Reception In a review for The New York Times Benjamin Percy writes: \\"In this way, The Yellow Birds joins the conversation with books like Leslie Marmon Silko’s “Ceremony,” Brian Turner’s Phantom Noise and Tim O’Brien’s classic, The Things They Carried — and wakes the readers of 'the spoiled cities of America' to a reality most would rather not face. Percy quotes the novel, writing: \\"Here we are, fretting over our Netflix queues while halfway around the world people are being blown to bits. And though we might slap a yellow ribbon magnet to our truck’s tailgate, though we might shake a soldier’s hand in the airport, we ignore the fact that in America an average of 18 veterans are said to commit suicide every day. What a shame, we say, and then move on quickly to whatever other agonies and entertainments occupy the headlines.\\" Michiko Kakutani included it as one of her 10 favorite books of 2012 and called it: \\"a deeply affecting book that conveys the horrors of combat with harrowing poetry. At once a freshly imagined bildungsroman and a metaphysical parable about the loss of innocence and the uses of memory.\\" The National Book Award citation describes The Yellow Birds as: \\"Poetic, precise, and moving, The Yellow Birds is a work of fiercest principle, honoring loss while at the same time indicting the pieties of war...An urgent, vital, beautiful novel that reminds us through its scrupulous honesty how rarely its anguished truths are told.\\" Adaptation The book was adapted on screen in 2017, The Yellow Birds was directed by Alexandre Moors and starred Jack Huston, Alden Ehrenreich, Tye Sheridan and Jennifer Aniston.

The name comes from the name of their initial stand in Ajax's home stadium, the Amsterdam Arena.  Background  VAK410 was founded on 26 January 2001 by fanatic supporters of the club who were tired of being on the waiting list for the already existing hooligan firm F-side. On that day, young Ajacied Karel organized the first meeting of the group's in the Amstel Cup home match against SBV Vitesse in row 114. The match resulted in a 1–2 loss. However, the club took a positive stance towards the initiative to create more of an atmosphere in the North side of the stadium, and so VAK410 was born.Vak410 anno 2001 Originally known as the Ajax Ultras, with ajaxultras.nl being the official website, the group relocated to row 415 on 11 February 2001 ahead of the home match against Willem II, right next to the \\"Away row\\" for visiting supporters. Ajax' fanzine De Ajax Ster, otherwise known as DAS, reported on the development of the row, despite the low turnout of the ultras during the match. However, two weeks later, on 25 February 2001, the group celebrated its first big success when a large gathering managed to silence the visiting crowd during the home match against FC Utrecht.Ajax bestraft vak 410 na afsteken vuurwerk The first match in their current location in the stadium, from which they took the name VAK410, was held on 19 August 2001, at which point the group had approximately 400 members. Considered one of the most famous Tifosi groups in the sport, the group considered itself to be an ultra fan group, and it distanced itself from hooliganism.Vak 410 van Ajax verhuist naar zuidzijde The group dissolved in the summer of 2016, after disagreements with Ajax Amsterdam's management, over the decision of the club's board to move them away from their years long location at VAK 410 of the Amsterdam Arena.  Incidents  Since the formation of the group, there have been several incidents that have led to negative press or even to the club being fined. In August 2010, Ajax was fined €10,000 for the group's behavior during a UEFA Europa League away match against Juventus due to severe destruction inside the stadium, the lighting of fireworks, and for injuring an Italian steward in the stadium.UEFA legt Ajax boete op Ajax was fined €10,000 once more in 2013 during the UEFA Champions League home match against Manchester City after VAK410 revealed a massive banner showing a crossed out Sheikh holding a bag of money, with the phrase 'Against Modern Football!' under it. UEFA called the banner tasteless and completely unfitting.Foto: Uefa beboet Ajax voor anti-sjeikspandoekVak 410 zegt sorry tegen Ajax-fans During the final of the KNVB Cup in 2014, the group sabotaged the match by throwing fireworks onto the pitch in the vicinity of their own goalkeeper. They did this because the final was held in 'De Kuip', the stadium of rival club Feyenoord. The match was stopped twice with Ajax leading 1–0. After resuming the match, Ajax eventually lost 1–5 to PEC Zwolle. The group first stated that throwing fireworks is an inalienable part of such finals. After pressure from authorities and the F-side, the group eventually did apologise for its behaviour in what would get known as the Vuurwerkincident.  Judaism  Ajax is popularly seen as having \\"Jewish roots\\". In the 1970s, supporters of rival teams began taunting Ajax fans by calling them Jews. Ajax fans, few of whom are actually Jewish themselves, countered this by embracing Ajax's \\"Jewish\\" identity: calling themselves \\"super Jews\\", chanting \\"Joden, Joden\\" (Jews, Jews) at games, and adopting Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David and the Israeli flag. This Jewish imagery eventually became a central part of Ajax fans' culture. At one point, ringtones of \\"Hava Nagila\\", a Hebrew folk song, could be downloaded from the club's official website. Starting in the 1980s, fans of Ajax' rivals started their antisemitic rhetoric, chanting slogans like \\"Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas\\" (\\"Hamas, Hamas, joden aan het gas\\"), hissing to imitate the flow of gas, giving Nazi salutes, etc. The eventual result was that many (genuinely) Jewish Ajax fans stopped going to games. In the 2000s, the club tried to persuade fans to drop its Jewish image, but to no avail. Supporters, both on and off the pitch, employ imagery associated with Jewish history and the Israeli nation to this day. Tottenham Hotspur's Yid Army use similar symbols.Amsterdam Journal - A Dutch Soccer Riddle - Jewish Regalia Without Jews NY Times  See also  *North Up Alliance *South Crew *Barra Brava *Casual (subculture) *Curva *Hooliganism *List of hooligan firms *Major football rivalries *Torcida References External links *VAK410 Official website Category:AFC Ajax Category:Association football hooligan firms Category:Gangs in the Netherlands Category:2001 establishments in the Netherlands Category:2016 disestablishments in the Netherlands ","title":"VAK410"},{"id":"42415198","text":"Sydney Harbour is the 10-mile long Y-shaped inlet of the Atlantic, oriented southwest-northeast on the northeast shore of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada.

The products of this process are sometimes referred to as \\"complex concepts.\\" Combining concepts allows individuals to use a finite number of concepts which they already understand to construct a potentially limitless quantity of new, related concepts. It is an essential component of many abilities, such as perception, language, synthetic reasoning, creative thought and abstraction. Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of cognitive psychology and cognitive science. Mechanism The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs. =Cognitive= Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. Constraint Theory Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. Diagnosticity refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. Plausibility refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. Informativeness is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum. If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. algorithms and heuristics). Spreading Activation The spreading activation model is a model in connectionist theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, brainstorming, and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected. Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked. When one concept is employed in working memory, the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as \\"priming.\\" Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories. Feature- Based Theories The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features. For example, one might reason that the complex concept \\"white jacket,\\" if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of \\"good for winter camouflage,\\" despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts \\"white\\" nor \\"jacket.\\" This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk. This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly. =Neurological= The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis. Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination. Of particular relevance is the left anterior temporal lobe. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum. Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. Semantic dementia is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid. Language As language is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism. =Lexical Concepts= A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a lexical concept. A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept. Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of adjectives to modify nouns and the use of adverbs to modify verbs and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as \\"burnt toast,\\" \\"eat roughly,\\" and \\"readily loved.\\" Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts. Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as \\"sound wave,\\" \\"video game,\\" and \\"sleeping pill.\\" =Interpretation= In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are interpreted. The first of these is dual-process theory. Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. Relational interpretation attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase \\"snake mouse\\" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. Property interpretation identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase \\"snake mouse\\" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body. The second principal theory is known as the Competition in Relations among Nominals theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, \\"chocolate cat\\" is usually interpreted as \\"a cat made of chocolate\\" rather than \\"a chocolate-eating cat\\" simply because the \\"made of\\" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with \\"chocolate.\\" Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to spreading activation models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities. For example, consider the example, \\"John spread butter on a bagel.\\" In this sentence, the lexical concepts \\"spread,\\" \\"butter,\\" and \\"bagel\\" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, \\"John baked a computer.\\" Because \\"baked\\" and \\"computer\\" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario. However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence \\"John saw an elephant cloud.\\" \\"Elephant\\" and \\"cloud\\" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term \\"elephant cloud\\" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts. Recently, within the interpretation framework of concept combination, in the context of cognitive modelling and cognitively inspired AI systems, it has been developed a probabilistic logical framework, embedding the head-modifier cognitive heuristics, able to account for complex human-like noun-noun concept combinations (like the PET-FISH problem). Such a framework has been used and tested as a generative tool for autonomous systems. Social Context Although many theories of novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause. When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed sense generation. This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The generation hypothesis accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science. The anaphor resolution hypothesis instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning. The dual-process hypothesis not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both. Creativity Creativity necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to convergent thinking, but not divergent thinking. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods. Educational applications The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to solve new problems. Máder & Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school mathematics education.

Southcott Estates Inc was a subsidiary of Ballantry Homes Inc, a developer,Part of the Ballantry Group of Companies, see and special purpose entity created just for purchasing and developing the land. The deal was conditional upon Southcott paying a 10% deposit, and the Toronto School Board getting severance permission from Toronto's Committee of Adjustment before a certain date. However, the Committee refused without reviewing a development plan for the land, which meant severance was not granted in time. Southcott sued for specific performance or damages. At trial, Southcott stated it never had any intention to mitigate its loss and had not tried, that it had no assets other than the deposit from Ballantry Inc for the deposit, and it was never going to purchase any other land. The courts below At the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Spiegel J held that: :* had the Board used its best efforts, the severance would likely have been granted, and the transaction would have been completed by the closing date; therefore, the Board’s breach caused Southcott’s loss;ONSC, par. 93116 :* specific performance was not an appropriate remedy as the land did not have the quality of uniqueness;ONSC, par. 128133 but :* Southcott was entitled to damages, which were assessed at $1,935,500.ONSC, par. 144146 He rejected the Board's submission that Southcott had mitigated damages through several purchases subsequent to the breach of the agreement, declaring: The Board appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, where Sharpe JA held that: :* the trial judge did not err in finding that the Board's breach was the cause of the failure to obtain a severance by the closing date,ONCA, par. 1114 but :* he did err in law in finding that the Board had not shown that Southcott could have mitigated its losses,ONCA, par. 2427 :* however, Southcott failed to make out a case for either specific performance or damages.ONCA, par. 30 As a result, nominal damages were awarded in the amount of $1. Leave to appeal and cross-appeal the decision were granted by the Supreme Court of Canada in November 2011: :* Southcott, while not appealing the trial judge’s refusal to award specific performance, maintained its losses were not avoidable. :* On cross-appeal, the Board questioned whether the Court of Appeal was correct in law in dismissing its argument relating to causation. At the Supreme Court In a 6-1 ruling, the appeal was dismissed with costs. As it was therefore unnecessary to consider the cross-appeal, it was dismissed without costs. =Majority opinion= Karakatsanis J began by summarizing the principles for mitigation previously adopted by the Court in Asamera Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Sea Oil & General Corporation where Lord Haldane's observation was endorsed: The principles have since been refined in further cases at the Court, as well as at the Federal Court of Appeal.SCC, par. 2425 Southcott had argued that, as a single-purpose company, it was impecunious and unable to mitigate without significant capital investment of the parent company or without the corporate mandate to do so. In addition, it would be reasonably foreseeable to those contracting with a single-purpose corporation that such an entity would have finite resources and a confined corporate mandate.SCC, par. 26 This was held to be insufficient: :* The claims relating to specific performance and damages were premised upon resources that were not tied up as a result of the breach alleged, which in this case did not affect Southcott’s ability to obtain capital.SCC, par. 27 :* In the absence of actual evidence of impecuniosity, finding that losses cannot be reasonably avoided simply because it is a single-purpose corporation within a larger group of companies, would give an unfair advantage to those conducting business through single-purpose corporations.SCC, par. 29 :* As a separate legal entity, Southcott was required to mitigate by making diligent efforts to find a substitute property, because those who choose the benefits of incorporation must bear the corresponding burdens, including the duty to mitigate its losses.SCC, par. 30 Asamera, when read together with Semelhago v. Paramadevan, holds that it \\"cannot be assumed that damages for breach of contract for the purchase and sale of real estate will be an inadequate remedy in all cases,\\" and specific performance will be available only where money cannot compensate fully for the loss, because of some “peculiar and special value” of the land to the plaintiff.Adderley v. Dixon (1824), 1 Sim. & St. 607, 57 E.R. 239, at p. 240 =Dissent= McLachlin CJ believed that the trial judge was correct in finding in fact that the Board had not proved that Southcott had an opportunity to mitigate, which was sufficient to dispose of the appeal. She would have reversed the Court of Appeal's ruling and restored the original verdict. She saw no basis on which to conclude that Southcott acted unreasonably in maintaining its suit for specific performance instead of mitigating its loss:SCC, par. 65 #It had a “fair, real, and substantial justification” for claiming specific performance of the contract.Asamera, at pp. 667-68SCC, par. 92 #The act of filing a claim for specific performance is inconsistent with the act of acquiring a substitute property.SCC, par. 93 #Plaintiffs can never be certain that an action for specific performance will succeed, particularly as this is an equitable, discretionary remedy. Demanding that losses be mitigated unless success in obtaining specific performance is assured would deter valid claims for specific performance and hold plaintiffs to an impossible standard.SCC, par. 94 #It can be fairly argued that Southcott did not act unreasonably in pursuing specific performance of the contract. Though the common law presumption of the uniqueness of real property no longer holds, a claim for specific performance may still be reasonable if a property has unique characteristics such that a substitute property is not readily available.Semelhago, at par. 22SCC, par. 95 #Whether it could have obtained financing to buy a different property is at the very least speculative.SCC, par. 96 Impact The decision has raised significant debate on many of the issues it discussed: :* Developers normally structure as single-purpose subsidiaries so that, if a market correction reduces land values, the parent company can pull the plug on the subsidiary and avoid liability for damages for not completing a purchase. If the purchaser had backed out, and the land had declined substantially in value, the seller would have been unable to recover any damages beyond the deposit. Therefore, it is arguably fair that Southcott failed to recover damages when the shoe was on the other foot. :* However, the decision (although seen to be well-based in legal theory) does not reflect the commercial reality of real estate development, where lenders are normally reluctant to advance funds to a company with limited assets that is embroiled in litigation, even when backed by a large corporate group. :* While Southcott appears to have significantly restricted the opportunity to pursue specific performance in relation to commercial transactions, it did not conclusively restrict specific performance to residential transactions. :* Although Southcott had admitted at trial that it made no attempts to purchase a comparable property, one can argue that a complete failure to make any efforts to mitigate is tantamount to that type of admission. Either way, damages for breach of contract continue to be the only remedy that the buyer should expect. :* Southcott is significant because it confirms that a claim for specific performance will not insulate a plaintiff from the duty to mitigate. It is also noteworthy because the majority as well as the dissent seem to accept by implication that impecuniosity is a defence to a failure to mitigate. :* In the event of termination of a contract for the purchase of land, a purchaser should carefully consider its capacity to both mitigate and complete the initial transaction before proceeding with a claim for specific performance. Steps should be taken at an early stage in order to prove the uniqueness of the property in question. It can also be argued that such steps should be considered prior to the acquisition of the property. :* Notes References External links Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:2012 in Canadian case law Category:Canadian contract case law Category:Canadian property case law ","title":"Southcott Estates Inc v Toronto Catholic District School Board"},{"id":"42415276","text":"The Plehwe Complex is a set of historic saltbox houses on Boerne Stage Road near Leon Springs in Bexar County, Texas, United States.

She did tremendous work in the field of x-ray crystallography of clay minerals. She was raised by a progressive family in a traditional era. She was able to further her education and led a life where she was able to pursue her passion of physics and engage in a artistic activities such as singing, painting, and writing. Early life Purnima was born into a progressive family on 12 October 1927 as the youngest daughter of Dr. Nares Chandra Sen-Gupta who was a constitutional lawyer and a progressive writer who had written over sixty-five books and several essays in Bengali as well as in English, some of them on women’s education. He believed in equal rights for men and women. She married the eminent anthropologist professor Surajit Chandra Sinha, former vice-chancellor, Visva-Bharati University who made significant contributions to understanding the process of acculturation of tribal peoples in India. Her Daughters Supurna Sinha and Sukanya Sinha are both physicists at Raman Research Institute and Indian Statistical Institute respectively. With her husband, they also started an informal school – Mela Mesha r Pathshala in Shantiniketan for tribal children. Education and career Purnima's early education started in Lake School for girls, in Kolkata, which was founded by her elder sister Sushama Sengupta. She then attended Asutosh College, followed by the Scottish Church College, and finally the prestigious Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta. She was the first woman to earn a PhD in Physics from Calcutta University, in 1956. A protégé of Professor Satyendra Nath Bose, the celebrated theoretical physicist known for his work in quantum mechanics, she set many benchmarks as a scientist while also indulging her creative talents as an artist, writer and a musician.Her own artistic interests are varied and include learning Hindustani classical music from Yamini Ganguly, and painting from the well-known painter Gopal Ghosh. She has also taken tabla lessons from Pandit Jnan Prakash Ghosh. Her other talents include sculpting and painting. Purnima's career in science spans many decades. She earned her doctorate in x-ray crystallography of clay minerals. She received her doctorate from the University of Calcutta as a student of the Rajabazar Science College in 1956-7, under the guidance of professor Satyendra Nath Bose. She has the distinction of being the first Bengali woman to receive a doctorate in physics. At the start of joining Professor Satyendra Nath Bose, she had scoured surplus army equipment sold as scrap on the footpaths of Calcutta after the Second World War. Purnima Sinha was looking for spare parts to build the X-ray equipment she needed for her doctoral research. We must remember that X-ray techniques were being applied to unravel DNA structure on other side of the globe around 1953. Most interestingly her research was funded by Assam Oil Company (research-industry collaboration in that era was unheard of). Not only did she build it, but she also went on to study different types of clay from all over India. Later on, Dr Sinha joined the Biophysics Department at Stanford University’s ‘Origin of Life’ project, which had an interface with her work.

She launched her clothing brand, Francesca Sterlacci Ltd. in 1980, and continued designing clothes under her label until 1989. Sterlacci joined the Fashion Institute of Technology as a teacher in 1990, and became the chairwoman of the Fashion department at the institute in 2001. In 2013, Sterlacci launched University of Fashion, an online library of fashion design videos.  Early life and education  Sterlacci was born in Hoboken, and raised in and Union City. When she was ten, she used scraps from her mother's sewing machine and prepared Barbie doll costumes. Her mother did not allow her to use the sewing machine herself, so she had to hand stitch dresses, and that helped her improve her hand stitching skills. She kept some of these dresses and sold others to neighbourhood friends. While studying at the Emerson High School in Union City, she collaborated with a friend on making mini and maxi skirts and selling them to boutiques in New York. After completing high school, she joined Fashion Institute of Technology and received Associate of Applied Science degree in fashion design. Upon graduating, she joined Jersey City State College for a bachelor's degree in art.  Career  Sterlacci started her career in the late 70s working for a body suit company. She later joined a junior sportswear firm, Sunday's Workclothes, who sent her to a lot to countries like India, Hong Kong, Italy, France and Taiwan. She became a head merchandiser at Time and Place where she managed five divisions. Sterlacci developed a label of her own in her spare time. She founded Francesca Sterlacci Ltd. in 1980 and the first collection consisted of 15 sportswear pieces. Her designs were greatly influenced by her travel while at Sunday's Workclothes. By 1981, she added leather to her collection. The top- selling clothes in her line were in leather and suede. In 1981, after positive feedback on her designs, she quit her day job and started working on her label full-time. Sterlacci started her business using savings and a few loans and did not have financial backers or factors. In 1983, she added a selection of knit and weave sportswear to the line. She opened her own showroom, and kept producing clothes under her label until 1989. In 1990, Sterlacci opened a freelance design service called Design Instinct, designing clothes for other designers. In 1990, she started teaching at Fashion Institute of Technology and in 2001, she became the Chair of FIT's Fashion Design Department. She held that position until 2004, when she moved to San Francisco and started teaching at the Academy of Art University where she taught until 2010. = University of Fashion = Sterlacci launched University of Fashion, an online library of fashion design videos, in 2013.

The memorial is an outgrowth of a failed effort to erect a Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial, which was authorized in 1986 but whose memorial foundation dissolved in 2005. Congress authorized the National Liberty Monument in January 2013. Push for the memorial In 1980, Lena Santos Ferguson, an African American woman, applied for membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), an organization for descendants of those who fought in the American Revolutionary War. Despite having excellent documentation of her ancestry and her ancestor's participation in the war, she could not find two members anywhere in the national organization to sponsor her for membership. Margaret Johnston, a member of the Mary Washington chapter of the DAR and wife of a General Motors executive, said, \\"It was made clear to me that [Ferguson] was not welcome because she is black.\\" DAR national president Sarah King admitted that blacks were not being admitted as members, but also claimed that some individuals were also disliked by existing members, were divorced, or rejected out of spite. In 1983, Ferguson was granted \\"limited\\" membership in the DAR, which meant she did not have voting rights and could not belong to a local chapter (where the work of the organization was conducted). After the Council of the District of Columbia threatened to revoke the DAR's city tax exemption and Ferguson threatened to sue to revoke its federal tax exemption, the DAR admitted Ferguson as a full member. The DAR and Ferguson negotiated an agreement in which the DAR would help minorities become part of the society, state in its membership materials that all people of whatever race were eligible for membership, offer scholarships to students in the District of Columbia (where the overwhelming majority of students were black), educate the DAR membership about the role African Americans played in the Revolutionary War, and identify all African Americans (slave or free) who fought in the war. The DAR also agreed to support a congressional resolution to establish a national memorial in Washington, D.C., honoring African Americans who fought in the Revolutionary War. =Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial= Map showing Area I (within the black border) of the National Capital Area, where the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial could have been constructed. Meanwhile, momentum was building in Congress for a memorial. The memorial had its genesis in a resolution introduced in Congress by Representative Nancy Johnson, a Republican from Connecticut. Her bill was a proclamation honoring black Revolutionary War patriots. The resolution was conceived by Maurice Barboza, Ferguson's nephew and a member of the Sons of the American Revolution. Barboza saw the bill as a means of pushing the DAR to admit his aunt, but it was quickly approved by Congress and President Ronald Reagan signed it into law (P.L. 98-245) on March 27, 1984. Realizing there was support in Congress, Barboza asked Johnson to sponsor legislation for a physical memorial. She agreed. DAR President King prevailed on a friend, Senator Al Gore (a Democrat from Tennessee), to sponsor identical legislation in the Senate. He agreed. After just 17 months, the bill was adopted by Congress and President Reagan signed the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Act (P.L. 99-558) into law on October 27, 1986. The act forbade the use of federal funds to build the memorial (a typical requirement by Congress). Instead, it established a nonprofit, the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial Foundation, to solicit funds to build the memorial. The foundation selected Constitution Gardens on the National Mall for the site of its memorial. Constitution Gardens is a lightly forested area and pond bounded on the west by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, on the east by 17th Street NW, on the north by Constitution Avenue NW, and on the south by the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. The area, formerly occupied by temporary federal buildings, was created in 1976 as a United States Bicentennial tribute. In July 1982, the Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence was dedicated on the island in the lake. This memorial is a low, curved stone wall facing the water and encompassing a tiny patio. Because the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) of 1986 (P.L. 99-625) barred memorials on the National Mall unless they were of \\"preeminent\\" and \\"lasting\\" historical significance, Barboza was forced to seek congressional authorization to locate the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial in Constitution Gardens. On March 25, 1988, President Reagan signed into law P.L. 100-265, allowing the memorial to be built in \\"Area 1\\" (the National Mall and its immediate environs).\\"Memorial Legislation.\\" National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission. June 22, 2013. Accessed 2014-04-04. Under the rules imposed by the CWA, the memorial foundation had seven years to complete fundraising, win approval of its design, and begin construction. Barboza incorporated the foundation in 1985 with himself, Ferguson and Johnson as members of the founding board. After five years of self-funding the project and using volunteers, Barboza received a commitment from the General Motors Corporation to help raise funds. In May 1989, GM sponsored the \\"One Nation Dinner\\" in Washington, D.C. that raised $250,000 and introduced the project to dignitaries, corporations and government leaders. The group was off to a good start after a long and tedious struggle between 1985 and 1989. Later, after Johnson became chairman of the board, the group foundered over her efforts to wrest control from Barboza and Ferguson and recast the message of the memorial. All the while the forward movement of the project began to lose purpose. Barboza tried to oust Johnson from the board she had packed with acquaintances but was later voted off in 1992. Ferguson resigned.[12] Problems with the appropriateness of the design and the meddling of Dwight also hindered fundraising and contributed to the debacle and waste that would come later.[13] From 1992 to 2005, extensions of the memorial construction deadline were granted by Congress four times. On October 20, 1996, Congress enacted the United States Commemorative Coin Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-329), which authorized the United States Mint to manufacture no more than 500,000 $1 commemorative coins. These coins, sold for $10 each, would be used to finance the memorial. But only 100,000 of the coins were sold during the year (1998) they were offered. Between 1996 and 1999, the foundation raised another $1.5 million for a total of $3.6 million in received contributions. But it spent $800,000 designing the memorial and another $1.8 million on salaries for staff, leaving it with just $1 million in its trust fund. The memorial's design was also problematic. In 1990, architect Marshall Purnell proposed an elliptical plaza with seven high statues of African American Revolutionary War soldiers and citizens. The United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA), which had design approval over all memorials in the National Capital Area, rejected the design as too monumental and too visible compared with the nearby Signers' Memorial. It counseled the foundation to eliminate the statues and seek a \\"landscape solution\\" as a memorial. In 1991, the memorial foundation held a charrette to seek a new design. Sculptor Edward Dwight's design for a granite block with figures of African American soldiers and citizens emerging from swirling rock was chosen. The CFA liked the design, but repeatedly asked for changes over the next five years. Dwight became convinced that members of the CFA and the National Park Service had \\"an issue with putting black faces on the National Mall\\". Dwight's design was subsequently approved by the CFA. But the changes left the memorial without any monumental elements, too small and pinched to attract financial support. Congressional authority to build the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial expired on October 27, 2005.\\"Authorized Memorials – Status of Authorities.\\" National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission. April 15, 2013. Accessed 2014-04-04. The memorial foundation dissolved, out of money. National Liberty Memorial While the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial was under design consideration, Congress enacted the Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act of 2003 (CWCRA). This law barred the erection of any memorial in Area 1 without the approval of the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission (NCMAC). In 2005, Barboza established the National Mall Liberty Fund D.C., a nonprofit foundation to honor African Americans (slave and free) who fought in the American Revolutionary War, who provided assistance to the war effort as civilians, and who sought their freedom during the Revolutionary period. In April 2006, Senator Chris Dodd (Democratic from Connecticut) introduced legislation to approve the new memorial. Dodd's legislation, however, did not refer to African Americans or any other minority, simply to \\"slaves and other persons who fought\\" in the war. Barboza asked the NCMAC to transfer the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial site approval to the National Liberty Memorial, but the agency declined to do so in 2007. The Dodd legislation died at the end of the 109th United States Congress on December 8, 2006. Dodd introduced new legislation, with altered wording, in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The Congress finally authorized the National Liberty Memorial on January 2, 2013, in Section 2859 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (). Congress declared the memorial to be a \\"commemorative work to slaves and free black persons who served in the American Revolution\\" as soldiers, sailors, or civilians. The National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. was authorized to build the memorial. Congress authorized the memorial to be constructed in Area 1 or Area 2 of the National Capital Area, but not in the \\"reserved\\" area designated by federal law. National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. was also authorized to begin raising private funds to construct a memorial, which would be turned over to the federal government upon completion. Under the rules established by the 2003 CWCRA, the National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. has seven years (until January 2, 2020) to raise the necessary funds to build the memorial, and to obtain siting, design, and other approvals from the NCMAC, CFA, and National Capital Planning Commission. =Preliminary memorial design and site= The National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. hired sculptor David Newton to design a preliminary memorial. Newton's draft depicts an African American father, mother, and child. The father is armed with a rifle, but not depicted as a soldier. The mother points toward the nearby Lincoln Memorial. The child wears a tricorne hat and is beating a drum. On July 23, 2013, the memorial foundation presented its first site selection report to the NCMAC. The foundation examined 43 potential sites before creating a short-list of five preferred site: northwest of the Lincoln Memorial, the United States Department of the Interior triangle on Virginia Avenue NW, Walt Whitman Park, Freedom Plaza, and a site on the west side of the Jamie L. Whitten Building (the headquarters of the United States Department of Agriculture). The NCMAC asked the foundation to reconsider Walt Whitman Park, the Interior Department triangle, and a new site—the western terminus of Constitution Avenue NW (the \\"belvedere\\") on the shores of the Potomac River. After reconsidering these sites and the others originally studied, the foundation requested that the site at the Whitten Building be approved. The Whitten site received the support of Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Chris Murphy on November 20, 2013. Because the Whitten site is in Area 1, the most protected part of the National Mall, use of the site requires approval by Congress. On September 26, 2014, President Barack Obama signed legislation allowing the National Liberty Memorial in Washington DC to be placed on the National Mall on a site next to the Department of Agriculture Building, extending authority to begin construction to 2021.

Under the Falekaupule Act (1997), the powers and functions of the Falekaupule are now shared with the Kaupule on each island, which is the executive arm of the Falekaupule, whose members are elected. The Kaupule has an elected president - pule o kaupule; an appointed treasurer - ofisa ten tupe; and is managed by a committee appointed by the Kaupule. The Falekaupule Act (1997) defines the Falekaupule to mean \\"traditional assembly in each island ... composed in accordance with the Aganu of each island\\". Aganu means traditional customs and culture. The Falekaupule on each island has existed from time immemorial and continues to act as the local government of each island. Generally men aged 50 years, and on some islands men aged 60 years, do most of the talking and decision making at meetings of the community councils (Falekaupule), which are organised according to the law and custom of each island. Although women have the vote in meetings of the Falekaupule on 7 of the 9 islands, but most do no exercise their voting rights. The traditional island meeting hall where important matters are discussed and which is also used for wedding celebrations and community activities is also known as the falekaupule or maneapa. Establishment of the Kaupule Section 5 (1) of the Falekaupule Act (1997) establishes the Kaupule of each Falekaupule, with six members who are elected as provided for in section 8. Section 5 (1) establishes that the Kaupule is the executive arm of the Falekaupule and performs all the functions conferred on the Falekaupule by the Falekaupule Act or any other Act, except for certain specified functions. Under section 6 the Kaupule is a “body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal and shall be capable of suing and being sued and of acquiring, holding and disposing of movable and immovable property.” Under section 18 provides for the election of the Pule o Kaupule - the person elected to preside over a Kaupule. Functions of the Falekaupule As described in section 40 and Schedule 3 of the Falekaupule Act (1997) the general functions of a Falekaupule includes local government functions related to agriculture, livestock and fisheries; building and town or village planning; education; forestry and trees; land; relief of famine and drought; markets; public health; public order, peace and safety; communications and public utilities; trade and industry; and other miscellaneous functions. The educational function of the Falekaupule includes responsibility to build, equip, maintain or manage any kindergarten primary school and primary school in the Falekaupule area; to supervise the compulsory education of children or specified categories of children between the ages of 5 and 15 years in accordance with the Education Act; and to grant and maintain scholarships or bursaries to persons resident in the Falekaupule area to attend any school or other educational institution in Tuvalu or elsewhere. The government secondary school in Tuvalu is Motufoua Secondary School, which is located on Vaitupu. Students board at the school during the school term, returning to their home islands each school vacation. Fetuvalu Secondary School, a day school operated by the Church of Tuvalu, is on Funafuti. Among the miscellaneous functions the Falekaupule is responsible for registering marriages, births or deaths. The Falekaupule is also directed to preserve the heritage of each island such as promoting and regulating the development of an arts and crafts industry; and the protection and preservation of the traditional culture of the Falekaupule area, including powers to prohibit or control the removal from it of any antique artifact. In accordance with section 41 and Schedule 3 “[i]t shall be the duty of every Falekaupule and of every Kaupule to use its resources to assist the police in the detection and prevention of crime within the area of its authority.”  Falekaupule Trust Fund (FTF)  The role of each Falekaupule in the economy of each island is assisted by the operation of the Falekaupule Trust Fund (FTF), which is a trust fund for outer island development that was established following the success of the Tuvalu Trust Fund in the management of the Economy of Tuvalu. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided A$6 million in loan funds, with the FTF being established in July 1999 and with the funds being invested in February 2000. The Government of Tuvalu agreed to match the amount provided by the ADB, with contributions from each of the eight island communities of Tuvalu, and with the contributions from the island contributions also matched by the Government. The governance structure of the FTF follows that of the Tuvalu Trust Fund, but each with island community having a representative on the board and the government provides a non-voting chair. In 2001 the value of the FTF was around $15 million of which $1.2 million was contributed by the island communities. Limits to the power of the Falekaupule The traditional power of the high-chief, or ulu-aliki, and the sub-chiefs (alikis) and the Falekaupule was without challenge. The consequence of defying the customary authority of the Falekaupule could result in customary process known as falaesea (to banishment a person from the island). A possible example of banishment is that in the late 17th century fighting occurred in Niutao between competing leaders. The followers of the defeated leaders were forced off Niutao and were allowed to settle on Nanumea. Tuvalu is now parliamentary democracy with the Constitution of Tuvalu stating that it is \\"the supreme law of Tuvalu\\" and that \\"all other laws shall be interpreted and applied subject to this Constitution\\"; it sets out the Principles of the Bill of Rights and the Protection of the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. Therefore, the traditional power of the Falekaupule is proscribed by the Constitution and by other elements of the Law of Tuvalu. =The relationship with members of parliament= The role of the member of the Parliament of Tuvalu in the parliamentary democracy established in the Constitution and the ability of Falekaupule to direct an MP as to their conduct as a member, was considered by the High Court of Tuvalu in Nukufetau v. Metia. The Falekaupule of Nukufetau directed Lotoala Metia, the elected member of parliament, as to which group of members he should join and when this directive was not followed the Falekaupule ordered Metia to resign as a member of parliament. When the Falekaupule attempted to enforce these directives through legal action, Ward CJ determined that the Constitution is structured around the concept of a parliamentary democracy; and that “[o]ne of the most fundamental aspects of parliamentary democracy is that, whilst a person is elected to represent the people of the district from which he is elected, he is not bound to act in accordance with the directives of the electorate either individually or as a body. He is elected because a majority of the voters regard him as the candidate best equipped to represent them and their interests in the government of their country. He is bound by the rules of parliament and answerable to parliament for the manner in which he acts. Should he lose the confidence of the electorate, he cannot be obliged to resign and he can only be removed for one of the reasons set out in sections 96 to 99 of the Constitution.” The Chief Justice also considered the question as to whether an MP's customary obligation to obey the commands of the island as expressed by the Falekaupule, overrides the MP’s duties to Parliament. The Falekaupule asserted that the customary process known as falaesea (to banishment a person who defied the customary authority of the Falekaupule) provided the legal authority to order Metia to resign as a member of parliament. The Chief Justice stated that “[i]f the fifth principle of the Preamble is to have any real meaning, it must apply to this case. The Constitution is law for the whole of Tuvalu. It clearly and properly acknowledges the customary role of, and respect for, the falekaupule on each island but, when support for an island's custom and tradition will have a disproportionate effect on the whole country, the island's interests must be subordinated to the national interest. The constitutional preservation of those traditional values is a vital part of present day Tuvalu but I cannot accept that a decision to implement them on one island is reasonable if it will seriously have an adverse effect on the whole country. In the present case, I am satisfied that it was unreasonable for the Falekaupule to ignore the interests of the whole country over an affront to its dignity by one of the island community.” The Chief Justice went on to state that “the carrying out of those threats by the orders banishing Metia and thus preventing him from properly performing the duties for which he was elected were clearly contrary to the spirit and intent of the Constitution and a totally unacceptable intrusion into the workings of the Tuvaluan Parliament. It should be borne in mind that the supremacy given Parliament by the Constitution is over the country as a whole and must, therefore, take precedence over purely local interests if the latter are in conflict with the national interest. I am satisfied that, as it was a challenge to parliamentary supremacy, it was unreasonable and was thus a breach of the defendant's right to procedural fairness. Similarly, the order of falaesea, although a part of the customary practices of Nukufetau, was so extremely disproportionate to the actions of the Falekaupule in similar previous cases as to be unfair.” = Ability to restrict the exercise of freedoms protected by the Constitution= Teonea v. Pule o Kaupule of Nanumaga is a case that raised issues in relation to the balancing the freedoms of religion, expression and association that are set out in the Constitution of Tuvalu against the values of Tuvaluan stability and culture that are also referred to in the Constitution. The dispute arose in July 2003 when the Falekaupule of Nanumaga passed a resolution that had the effect of banning the Brethren Church from seeking converts in Nanumaga. The Falekaupule had decided that the preaching of the Brethren Church was causing division in the Nanumaga community. The decision of Ward CJ balanced the freedoms of religion, expression and association against the values of Tuvaluan stability and culture, with the Chief Justice accepting the evidence of the unrest and tension on Nanumaga. The decision of the Chief Justice was to refuse to grant the declaration sought by Mase Teonea – that the resolution was unlawful as it was contrary to the Constitution. In the Court of Appeal of Tuvalu the majority judgments of Fisher and Paterson JJA allowed the appeal, so that the judgment of the Chief Justice was set aside. The Court of Appeal made the declaration that the resolution of the Falekaupule of 4 July 2003 was contrary to the Constitution. Tomkins JA provided a minority opinion in which he accepted the decision of the Chief Justice and would have dismissed the appeal. The approach to the constitutional questions that the Court of Appeal should take was described by Paterson JA who stated: :“[I]t is my view that it is for the Court to determine whether the circumstances are such that it is necessary to regulate or place some restriction on the exercise of the rights at issue in this case. The balancing act requires a consideration of the importance of the freedoms in question and whether it is necessary to regulate or place some restrictions on the exercise of those freedoms if the exercise: : [a] may be divisive, unsettling or offensive to the people; or : [b] may directly threaten Tuvaluan values or culture. :Section 29(5) of the Constitution makes it clear that a restriction may be lawful even if it restricts religious freedom, if the exercise of the rights would lead to the results specified in section 29(4). This provision is subject to sections 12 and 15 which provides that any restriction must be reasonably justifiable in a democratic society that has a proper respect for human rights and dignity when considered in the light of the circumstances existing at the time.” References Category:Politics of Tuvalu ","title":"Falekaupule"},{"id":"42415868","text":"Góriz Góriz or Refuge of Góriz, is a mountain refuge located in the province of Huesca in the Spanish Pyrenees.

It is the homeland of the Chumburu, but Bassari, Gonjas, Kokombas and Nawuri(s) are also indigenous in the area. Land, however, can only be acquired with the permission of the village chief and the king, who are both natives and officials of the Chumburung kingdom. Chumburung is also the name of the language of the Chumburu. The kingdom of Chumburung encompasses a number of villages at both sides of the Dakar River, from Kojobonipe in the North to Lonto in the South-West and Wiae in the East, both on the shores of Lake Volta.

Most important, the kingdom of Chumburung does not spread across Lake Volta toward Banda and beyond. These parts of Volta Region belong to the kingdom and traditional area of Krachi. Furthermore, Kabesi is an exclave of the Nawuri kingdom around the town of Kpandae. Chumburung is remote from the modern world in many senses. The few roads that exist in the area can only be plied by heavy vehicles, such as lorries, Benz buses in good condition, strong pick-ups and 4WD vehicles. Since few inhabitants can afford such means of transport for private use, the most popular vehicle is the motorcycle. Public transport consists of one Benz daily between Kpandae and Salaga (leaving Kpandae at dawn, arriving in Salaga around 10 a.m., and returning in the afternoon) and one Benz bus daily between Banda and Salaga, serving almost all the villages of Chumburung (leaving Banda at dawn and also returning in the afternoon).

Practice Temples in South India, hold communal meals for people of all sects, during special religious occasions. These meals, are typically of the traditional South Indian variety, where hindu people are served food over plantain leaves on the temple floor. The ritual of Made Made Snana involves devotees rolling over the plantain leaves, once food has been partaken by Brahmins. The devotees then take a Holy dip in the nearby Kumaradhara River, after which the ritual is said to be complete. The practice is said to be more than 500 years old. It is believed that the ritual rids one of bad Karma, skin diseases and other ailments. Devotees say it is good stress relief.Devotees call it catharsis, while intellectuals call it atrocity Made Made Snana was predominantly practiced on certain festive days in Subramanya temples of Karnataka, but has also been performed at vaishnavite places such as the Krishna Math, Udupi. The practice is actively practiced in the Kukke Subramanya Temple, and in the Subramanya temples of Kalavara, Kundapura Taluk and Ramanathapura, Hassan District. The Supreme Court of India has stayed the Karnataka High Court order allowing such rituals to continue. Since the conventional Made Made Snana is now illegal, a modified version known as \\"Ede Snana\\", in which devotees roll over \\"prasada\\" (food offered to the deity) or consumed by cows is still practised. Controversy The practice in the prominent Kukke Subramanya Temple has generated controversy in the State of Karnataka, where certain groups and individuals, including the State president of the Backward Classes Awareness Forum, K S Shivaram, who suggested that the practice symbolizes slavery, are demanding a ban, calling it a campaign against “blind beliefs”.Mixed reactions to SC verdict on made snana The practice is generally performed by Hindus of all varna, including the Brahmins. The protestors however claim to be campaigning against Dalit \\"oppression\\" at the hand of Upper-caste Hindus, especially the Brahmins. .The groups claim to be protesting, the \\"casteism\\". \\"barbarism\\" and \\"superstition\\" of the practice, and against the caste-based segregation followed during the communal meals. Pejawar do support this superstitious act.Pejawar fupport for Made Snana It has also been reported that neither the Government of Karnataka, nor the Kukke Subramanya Temple administration endorses the continued practice of the ritual. The imposition of a ban, however, has been challenged in the courts by the very community the protestors claim to be defending. It has been continually challenged in the court by, the Rajya Adivasi Budakattu Hitharakshana Vedike(ರಾಜ್ಯ ಆದಿವಾಸಿ ಬುಡಕಟ್ಟು ಹಿತರಕ್ಷಣ ವೇದಿಕೆ), a tribal Adivasi (classified as Dalit) rights group, who have questioned the motives in banning a practice voluntarily undertaken by people from all walks of life: \\"“People from Brahmin communities and people hailing from all other communities perform this ritual out of their own wish. It is a sort of cathartic communication with the supreme divine for many. The ritual should never be gauged in terms of logic because it is a subjective matter governed by sentiments and belief system of the people performing it,” says Rajya Adivasi Budakattu Hitharakshana Vedike president Bhaskar Bendodi who has been fighting a legal battle to protect the ritual. He questions the intention of the intellectuals who remain silent throughout the year and plunge into action against the ritual only when the temple is all set to organise it during three days of ‘Shashti’ festival.\\" It has also been reported that members from the forest tribe, Malekudiyas, who traditionally decorate the Temple Ratha for the procession, refused to do so, were the stay on the practice, not lifted. Udayavani reports a member of the community as saying, \\"The Malekudiyas of the region refuting the charges of the intellectuals that atrocities are inflicted on the Dalits in the name of the ritual, say that no dalit is put on a gun point by anybody to perform the ritual.\\" Not surprisingly, the practice continues to draw devotees from all over the state, while simultaneously drawing harsh condemnation on the Internet. Government action The Government of Karnataka sought to bypass the courts by including a provision banning the practice, in the Anti- Superstition bill tabled -and subsequently dropped- in the Winter assembly of 2014. The legislation also included laws, which allowed the state to gain administrative control of Hindu Temples & Mutts over arbitrary transgressions. The Chief Minister has been accused of causing social strife by raising needless anti-Hindu, anti-Brahmin sentiments for political gain.

To counter the German invasion of Belgium, the French commander-in-chief, General Joseph Joffre, ordered an attack upon the centre of the German front. The attack was to be conducted by the French Fourth Army comprising the Colonial Corps and II Corps. Simultaneously, the German army turned the 5th Army southwards towards the French border. The French Colonial Corps advanced towards Neufchâteau expecting the nearest German forces to be several days march away. Advanced elements of the 3rd Colonial Infantry Division (Léon Amédée François Raffenel) marching column clashed with German cavalry north of Rossignol and soon found themselves facing a strong defensive German position. After several bayonet charges through dense woods failed to make progress, French troops retreated southwards to Rossignol. The German 11th Division and 12th Divisions pushed around both flanks and engaged that part of the Colonial Corps still on the march. With the French II Corps behind schedule and unable to offer any support, German artillery destroyed the bridge at Breuvanne. The bridge was on the only route by which the 3rd Colonial Division at Rossignol could be reinforced. The Germans then defeated the French remaining in the village, the rest of the Colonial Corps pulled back to defensive positions. The 3rd Colonial Division was destroyed as a fighting force, with casualties of about 10,520 men killed, wounded or missing. Raffenel was killed as was Charles Rondony one of his brigade commanders; Charles Montignault, the other brigade commander, was captured. Another 868 men were lost from the supporting 2nd Colonial Division; German casualties were between 3,473 and 3,984 men. The alleged involvement of francs-tireurs at Tintigny and Rossignol resulted in reprisals in which German troops killed 63 civilians shortly after the battle; another 122 were court-martialed and shot.  Background  Pre-war concentrations of forces on the Western Front Germany declared war upon Russia on 1 August 1914 and upon France two days later. The German high command sought a quick victory over France in the west before the Russian Army could complete its lengthy mobilisation process. They implemented a modified form of the Schlieffen Plan, a pre-war deployment plan that sought to outflank the French fortifications south of Verdun. On 4 August German armies advanced into Belgium, whilst holding a static defensive front in the south. The French Colonial Corps, part of the Fourth Army was situated at Stenay (North-eastern France) on the river Chiers, with the XII Corps on its left flank and the II Corps on its right. The Colonial Corps was formed of Troupes coloniales raised in France for service abroad, as well as troops raised in the colonies, such as parts of the Army of Africa. The corps comprised the 2nd and 3rd Colonial Infantry Divisions with supporting non-divisional assets. The 3rd Colonial Division, which saw the heaviest fighting at Rossignol, was composed entirely of regular army troops and was considered one of the elite formations of the French army. The men were all volunteers, as French law forbade the use of its metropolitan conscripts abroad, and almost all had seen action in the colonies. The only reserve elements in the formation, the 5th and 6th reserve squadrons of the 6th Dragoon Regiment which had recently joined the division as reinforcements, were composed mainly of former Colonial Corps soldiers and so were rated highly. The division was reckoned to be of a similar standard to that of the British regular army. General Joffre, commander-in-chief of the French armies, decided to strike against the German centre in Belgium in order to threaten the communication lines of the German right flank which would be subject to a simultaneous attack by the northern French forces. In accordance with this plan the French Grand Quartier Général (GQG, army headquarters) issued orders for the French Fourth Army to move north into Belgium at 9.30 p.m. on 20 August. The Colonial Corps was to establish itself at Tintigny, in Belgium on 22 August whilst the II Corps was to move on Léglise via Bellefontaine to cover the right flank.  Prelude  = Strategic movements = Map showing army-level movements on the Western Front in August 1914 The Colonial Corps set off northwards with an advance guard of units drawn from the 3rd Division (General Charles Montignault). This unit, comprising the 1st Colonial Infantry Regiment, the 4th battery of the 2nd Field Artillery Regiment, two platoons of the 3rd Chasseurs d'Afrique and the 6th Squadron of the 6th Dragoon Regiment, marched north to Virton, Belgium. The French troops brushed aside German cavalry reconnaissance units and met no resistance. The French advanced through Chauvenoy and St Vincent and captured the bridge at Breuvanne by nightfall on 21 August. The remainder of the 3rd Division followed on behind, hampered by late changes of orders, blocked roads, hot weather, a rainstorm and thick fog; the unit made the journey in twenty hours. The opposing German forces comprised the VI Corps (General Kurt von Pritzelwitz) which took little offensive action on 20 August except to capture Neufchâteau which was intended to house the XVIII Reserve Corps. Late on 21 August the over-riding German strategy was changed, instead of proceeding westwards the 5th Army (Crown Prince Wilhelm) was directed to turn south to capture Virton. The 11th Division (5th Army) was to take Tintigny and the 12th Division Rossignol, with the 4th Army protecting their right flank. The French 4th Army cavalry and aerial reconnaissance units had detected the strong German presence and the lack of westward movement. GQG refused to change their assessment of the situation and told French generals that the German forces were still assumed to be proceeding to the north-west at some two to three days march from the 3rd Colonial Division.  Battle  = Initial contact = Rossignol and vicinity from a 1954 map, Neufchâteau is off the north of this extract, Virton to the south-south-east and Sedan due west. At 6.40 a.m. on 22 August General Léon Amédée François Raffenel, commander of the French 3rd Division, reached St Vincent in heavy fog where he met with the Colonial Corps commander, General Jules Lefèvre. Lefèvre issued his orders for the day, stating that Raffenel's division was to march to Neufchâteau and secure billets. Lefèvre indicated that he did not expect to encounter the enemy until 23 or 24 August. The German Fourth Army spotted the advance of the Colonial Corps by aerial reconnaissance and means of their cavalry screen, but did not know whether this force intended to continue north or move eastwards. As a consequence the German 11th and 12th divisions were warned to expect contact with strong French forces. Final confirmation of the French intentions came on the morning of 22 August when the German cavalry screen encountered French troops of the 6th Dragoons moving northwards on the road to Neufchâteau. The opposing cavalry met some south of Rossignol and the French were successful in driving the Germans back and clearing the road. The remainder of the 3rd Division, following in column along a road hemmed in by thick hedgerows and wire fences, was in good spirits in anticipation of an easy march. The French dragoons soon crossed the Semois River and cleared the village of Rossignol before heading into the dense Ligny forest. Around into the forest they met with elements of the German 2nd Uhlan Regiment which had been advancing southwards from Les Fosses. The Uhlans dismounted and opened fire before withdrawing northwards. The French cavalry resumed their advance but further north came upon the 157th Infantry Regiment deployed in defensive positions behind a crest from which it could carry out enfilade fire upon the road at several kilometres range. The French cavalry suffered heavy casualties from rifle fire and withdrew behind a crest. At 7.23 a.m. the French advance guard commander requested additional orders from his superiors - he was told to recommence the advance but protested that it was impossible to do so. The 2nd Battalion, 1st Colonial Infantry Regiment was sent forwards to clear the road by the bayonet. The colonel of the colonial regiment believed he was facing only a small German detachment, with their nearest major units still believed to be some to the east. A series of frontal bayonet charges were unable to penetrate the strong German positions, with the French hampered by the dense forest that surrounded the road limited visibility to . The German forces were forced to remain in their positions, unable to counterattack due to the continuous assaults and inability to deploy their artillery within the forest. = Escalation = General Martin Chales de Beaulieu, commander of the German 12th Division General Raffenel met with his advance guard commander and decided the German forces were of no significant strength. Raffenel established his command post in the village of Rossignol and ordered the 2nd Colonial Infantry Regiment, which had arrived at 10 a.m. under the command of Charles Rondony to support the 1st Colonial Infantry in the forest. Raffenel also ordered the divisional artillery deployed near the village where it could fire on the forest under protection from the 3rd African Chasseurs and one detached battalion of the 2nd Colonial Infantry. At this point General Martin Chales de Beaulieu, commander of the German 12th Division, became aware that the 157th Infantry Regiment was under great pressure and had suffered many casualties. Chales de Beaulieu ordered the 63rd Infantry Regiment and a battery of artillery to move around the French left flank to Termes. This force entered Termes at 11 a.m. and engaged French troops still moving along the road towards Rossignol. A firefight erupted and a battery of the German artillery went into action on nearby Hill 363, supported by the machine guns of the infantry. A French artillery battery, still in column of march and unable to move off the road due to marshes and fences, deployed on the highway and within minutes had almost wiped out the German artillery - destroying three guns and killing or wounding almost all of the crews. The two remaining German batteries deployed behind the crest of Hill 363 and commenced indirect fire upon the French column. The supporting 63rd Infantry Regiment was unable to advance to the road but continued to harass the French forces. Simultaneously General Von Weber's 11th Division, moving to seize Tintigny via Ansart, discovered the French 3rd Division in Column of March on the Rossignol-Breuvanne road. Deploying some artillery onto Hill 345, near Breuvanne bridge, the remainder of the 11th Division advance guard continued its march southwards. Thus the French found themselves threatened on both flanks. = French withdrawal = The French continued to attack the German centre in the Ligny Forest and by 10.30 a.m. had managed to incapacitate almost all of the 157th Infantry Regiment's officers and caused the German troops to waver. However the French officers, easily distinguished by their gold braided kepis and white gloves, suffered particularly heavy casualties - including three battalion commanders who were felled by a single burst of machine gun fire. Lacking senior commanders the French were fragmented into squad-sized units led by subalterns and non-commissioned officers. French Lieutenant-Colonel Guerin, noting the disorganisation amongst the remaining troops, took the initiative and ordered a fighting withdrawal towards Rossignol. A covering position was established some 300m south of the forest edge. The French cavalry at Rossignol, receiving orders to defend a French battery deployed to the east failed to locate the artillery and instead attempted to charge the German artillery on Hill 363. Unable to reach the gunners due to marshland, impenetrable fences and heavy defensive fire they moved south across the Breuvanne bridge and west towards Termes. This difficult movement badly disorganised the unit and it took until the end of the day for it to reform, ruling out any effective involvement in the battle. = Encirclement of Rossignol = A contemporary photograph of the Semois River at nearby Les Bulles At 11 a.m. the bridge over the Semois, the only access to the village of Rossignol from the south, was destroyed by German artillery fire from the 11th Division at Ansart. This prevented two battalions of the 3rd Colonial Infantry Regiment, the entirety of the 7th Colonial Infantry Regiment and the Colonial Corps artillery from reaching Rossignol. Raffenel, already concerned by the delays in bringing up his reserves, was isolated in Rossignol with a fraction of his division. At this point De Beaulieu committed his reserve brigade to take the French covering position south of the woods. To the south the French artillery remained confined to the road, unable to render any support to the fight at Rossignol and being whittled down by infantry and artillery attacks from the east, west and south- east. The German 11th Division, less the one battalion of artillery at Hill 345, had reached Tintigny by 10 a.m. and continued onwards to St Vincent. At Tintigny the streets had been barricaded with wagons and German artillery units moving through the town were fired upon, injuring some horses. In response German forces set fire to a number of houses to flush out their attackers and opened fire on the church with artillery, causing some French civilian deaths. The initial attacks were blamed by the Germans on armed civilian francs-tireurs but other sources suggest the attackers to be a French patrol or mobilised Belgian forestry troops. At the same time Lefèvre and his Colonial Corps headquarters was moving through St Vincent on the way to Neufchâteau. Encountering a small unit of German cavalry north of the town which was dispersed by his Dragoon escort the headquarters staff found themselves subject to artillery and rifle fire. Lefèvre ordered the 7th Colonial Infantry Regiment and some artillery to the east of St Vincent to defend the town and removed his headquarters to Jamoigne. Here he encountered the lead elements of the 2nd Colonial Division, which, comprising the 4th Army reserve, he lacked the authority from his commander to redirect. Despite this the 2nd Division commander, General Paul Leblois, acted on his own initiative to send the 22nd Colonial Infantry Regiment to Termes to support the 3rd Division. They pushed back two German battalions and retook half of the town before being ordered to withdraw, for the loss of 2 officers and 54 men killed and 14 officers and 182 men wounded. The French II Corps was unable to render any effective support on the right flank as, three hours behind schedule, it was halted to the south of Tintigny. The 3rd Division at Rossignol, cut into two by the destruction of the bridge, hurriedly organised the defence of the village. Raffenel's forward elements were still fighting a retreat from the woods and he had no means of communication with that part of his division trapped south of the river. The 1st and 2nd battalions of the 3rd Colonial Infantry Regiment, unable to join their third battalion at Rossignol instead attacked the Germans to the west at Termes. Suffering losses from artillery and machine gun fire from Termes and in their rear from Ansart they were eventually forced to retreat to Jamoigne. = Defence of the village = Ernest Psichari who died during the last stand of the French artillery at Rossignol At 12.30 p.m. the German 157th Infantry Regiment and 2nd Uhlans, reached the southern limit of the forest and encountered Rondony's hastily organised defence force – which had orders from Raffenel to hold Rossignol \\"at all costs\\" – defending a small crest. This force comprised only some 900 men with 15 officers of the infantry but was supported by the machine gun companies of the 1st and 2nd Colonial Infantry Regiments, whose 12 guns stiffened the defence. The Germans managed to bring up two 77mm guns and two 105mm howitzers along the forest road which opened fire on Rondony's men and the clock tower in the village, further fire was directed upon the French from artillery across the Semois to their rear. For more than two hours Rondony, reinforced by ad-hoc units retreating from the woods, was able to hold the German forces in place. The first major German attack came at 2.30 p.m. and was repelled by machine gun and rifle fire but French resistance was weakening, by 3 p.m. only 500 men remained on the firing line and most of the French machine guns were out of action. A second German assault at 3.30 p.m. managed to gain the crest, despite a desperate French counter-charge, and forced the French back to the village. The divisional HQ had been dispersed by 2 p.m. and the commanding general, Raffenel, was last seen alive reporting to the commander of the 3rd Colonial Infantry Regiment, having crossed the Semois carrying a rifle, that all was lost. left An initial attack upon Rossignol at 4 p.m. was repelled after half an hour's hard fighting at the village's edge. With the covering position neutralised the German artillery was able to move through the forest and come into action, setting the village ablaze. German forces eschewed a direct assault, instead encircling the village and capturing outlying French positions and the divisional command staff – some 328 men in total. The German troops then captured the remaining French artillery trapped between Rossignol and the Semois river. The French gunners fought to the last, firing off the remainder of their ammunition, disabling their guns and killing their limber horses before surrendering. It was in this action that French author, religious thinker and artillery officer Ernest Psichari was killed whilst defending his artillery pieces. The only continuing French resistance in Rossignol was at the north of the village where mutual exhaustion had led to a pause in the battle. The Germans committed the 23rd Infantry Regiment into action from reserve, these men swept into the village with little opposition at around 5.30 p.m. Seeing that the French appeared ready to surrender they formed into column and marched into the village square with drums beating, taking the surrender of some 200 men, 10 officers and General Montignault. The remnants of the French defence force – some 400–500 men of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Colonial Infantry together with elements of the engineers and chasseurs – attempted to break-out to the south-east between the German 11th and 12th Divisions. Hit by artillery and running into the German VI Corps and V Corps command posts only a fraction of this force was able to reach French lines and join the 2nd Colonial Division at Jamoigne. After a final attack the German troops were able to take possession of Rossignol itself by 6.50 p.m., no pursuit was made of the French south of the Semois.  Aftermath  Fourth Army commander, Fernand de Langle de Cary (centre) meeting with Joffre and Adolphe Guillaumat, member of the Minister of War's cabinet At 5 p.m. Lefèvre finally received direct control of the 2nd Colonial Division but by 6 p.m. the 7th Colonial Infantry had come under heavy attack at St Vincent. The German 22nd Infantry Brigade, amounting to five-and-a-half battalions of infantry, with supporting artillery and machine guns pushed the ten French companies then in St Vincent back despite French superiority in artillery (48 guns to the German's 18 pieces). The French retreated by echelon to a defensive line on the road to Limes which the Germans declined to assault. General Fernand de Langle de Cary, commanding the Fourth Army, only became aware of the extent of the defeat his troops had suffered at the end of the day. Reporting to Joffre that he had suffered a \\"serious check at Tintigny; all troops engaged with unsatisfactory results\\" he noted that because of his losses he would be unable to carry out his orders for the 23 August. Indeed, the collapse of the 3rd Colonial Division had left a gap on the front that was practically undefended by French troops. Joffre refused to believe him and reported to Minister of War Adolphe Messimy that he had ensured the French armies were placed where \\"the enemy is most vulnerable\\" and that the troops had \\"the advantage of superiority\\", despite the fact that the French Third and Fourth armies were actually outnumbered. Joffre's strike against the supposedly weak German centre had failed and the armies in the Ardennes were forced to retreat, the Third Army to Verdun and the Fourth to Stenay and Sedan. Map showing subsequent allied withdrawals to early September 1914 French losses were extremely heavy, the 3rd Colonial Division having lost 10,520 men killed, wounded or missing (the 2nd Colonial Division lost 868 men), the divisional artillery wiped out, and much of the transport lost. Generals Rondony and Raffenel were amongst those killed, becoming the first French generals to lose their lives during the war. The Germans took 3,843 prisoners, including two generals and captured 39 artillery pieces, 103 caissons and six machine guns. German losses were between 3,473 and 3,984 men in total from the 11th and 12th Divisions. The action has been described as one of the deadliest of the Battle of the Frontiers. The 3rd Colonial Division was no longer a fighting force. The 1st and 2nd Colonial Infantry Regiments were completely destroyed as were the 2nd Colonial Field Artillery Regiment and the 3rd Chasseurs d'Afrique. The 3rd and 7th Colonial Infantry Regiments were no longer combat-effective. The latter was able to reform from two companies that had been detached to guard the corps airfield and five companies reconstituted from the original three battalions. French losses were astonishingly high with individual units suffering up to 70% fatalities and most the prisoners taken being wounded. This reflects the quality of the division, with men dying where they stood rather than surrender. In addition to the civilians killed by German troops on 22 August at Tintigny, a further group was taken prisoner and interrogated by a German officer who afterwards had forty of the men shot. Another group of civilians were marched towards Rossignol, where, upon hearing the sound of gunfire, four were executed, the remainder were taken back to Tintigny and used as human shields against French artillery fire on 23 August. In all 63 of the inhabitants of Tintigny were killed by the German forces and the hamlet itself almost completely destroyed. Subsequent to the battle the rumour spread around German troops that the French at Rossignol had been assisted by civilians. In addition to those executed by German courts-martial at nearby Arlon, 122 civilians (108 of which were from Rossignol) were accused of involvement and executed on the orders of Colonel Richard Karl von Tessmar by telephone from Luxembourg. Two francs- tireurs captured at Les Bulles by the 157th Infantry Regiment on 23 August were shot. The battle's dead were buried near to where they fell – the Germans, who possessed the battlefield, in war cemeteries, the French in unmarked graves. The Colonial Corps monument at the boundary of the woods north of Rossignol was erected in 1927 to honour the French dead of the battle. The executed civilians were originally buried at Arlon, their place of execution, but were disinterred in 1920 in the presence of King Albert of Belgium and committed to a purpose-built mausoleum in Rossignol. Queen Elisabeth unveiled a monument at the site in 1925.

Shootings and stabbing occurred throughout the city following verbal insults between students from both sides at a local school on Wednesday, two days before the violence. Cars were torched and homes were looted and burned down. The army had intervened to contain the crisis following a call by Aswan's governor. Vendetta killings are very common in Upper Egypt and can last across generations, but this recent outbreak of feudal violence was described by the police as \\"the worst in recent memory\\", threatening to turn into a wide-scale ethnic conflict.  Friday  Violence erupted in the Al-Seel Al-Refy district late Friday April 4, 2014, leaving three people dead as a result of a long running tribal dispute. The clashes were sparked when a woman was harassed and students from both sides later sprayed offensive graffiti at a local school. The injured were taken to Aswan University Hospital under tight security to avoid acts of vengeance from both sides. Gunfights spread beyond the residential area to outside the local hospital and morgue near the city’s center, a few kilometers away from the touristic and commercial realms of the city.  Saturday  The next day, a second round of intense fighting left 20 people killed and more than fifty injured. The two sides used gunfire and Molotov cocktails resulting in several houses burned to the ground before security forces were able to stop the fighting on Saturday morning. Seventeen of the dead were from the Beni Helal clan. Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab formed a fact-finding committee on the incidents to uncover the reasons behind the bloodshed after meetings with the clashing sides and a visit to the scene of incidents.  Sunday  Nubian clan members blocked a main street with burning car tyres while members of the Beni Helal tribe set ablaze carts on another main road. At least two more people were killed and five other were wounded in renewed clashes after 48 hours of violence despite heightened security presence in the region. An angry mob from the Arab clan torched more new Nubian homes after collecting the bodies of their relatives to bury. The attack pushed armed Nubians to retaliate in pitched gun battles. Police struggled to disperse the mob fighting outside the hospital. In the wake of the deaths, the Interior Ministry announced that it had arrested three members of the Bani Hilal tribe that were allegedly involved in the fighting.  Domestic response  Egypt's prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab and interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim traveled to Aswan on Saturday to meet governor Mostfa Yousri as well as tribal leaders involved to help defuse tensions and visited the site where the violence took place. Mahlab promised to arrest perpetrators and seize unlicensed weapons and military forces have already been deployed in the area to prevent further clashes. Security presence also intensified and a curfew was imposed when clashes were renewed on Sunday. The military accused the Muslim Brotherhood of involvement in the strife. Another joint statement by the two clans accused \\"invisible hands\\" of igniting the feud. A former member of parliament who had previously mediated between the two sides, told Egyptian media that the handwriting in the graffiti insulting both tribes was the same and noted that a \\"third party aimed to create strife.\\" The undersecretary of the local Ministry of Endowment office claimed that a teacher who \\"belongs to the Brotherhood\\" drew the graffiti. On 13 April 2014, Al-Azhar Sheikh Ahmed el- Tayeb went to Aswan in order to complete mediation between the two rivals. el- Tayeb announced that a committee will be formed by Al-Azhar to supervise compensation.

It was aired on April 2, 2014. The episode was written by Megan Ganz and Ben Karlin and directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller. The episode touches heavily on the theme of discomfort in settling into new phases of life. Plot Jay (Ed O'Neill) was sick the whole week and Claire (Julie Bowen) had to replace him at work, something that she performed exceptionally and cannot stop talking about it to Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter), and Luke (Nolan Gould) on their way to Jay's for the \\"Jay's Night\\" he has organized. When they get there, Claire expects to hear at least one \\"thank you\\" from her father for her good job at the office but he never says it. Claire says that she has learned all these years not to expect anything more from her father and pretends that she does not care but things between her and Jay get more intense when Jay decides to make his own sauce for the pasta despite the fact that Claire has already made one. Luke (Nolan Gould) tells Manny (Rico Rodriguez) that there is a party happening nearby to which he is not invited but wants to go to. Manny tells him that they must stay for Jay's Night instead going to a party they are not invited to. Manny catches Luke trying to leave and tries to change his mind but Luke does not hear and goes to the party. Manny follows him and when they reach the door, the party host recognizes Manny and reveals that Manny had been invited to the party making Luke feel rejected and dejected, he reveals that he felt that Manny had always been the awkward one and he the cool one, but now Manny's style was more liked. Cam's (Eric Stonestreet) dad sends him and Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) a cake topper for their wedding cake that he made himself. The topper is made of soap and it is a miniature of Cam and Mitch. Cam is excited with the gift while Mitch hates it but he can not say anything because both of them have already used their three vetoes they had for the wedding, so he tries everything he can to destroy it. Phil (Ty Burrell) helps Gloria (Sofía Vergara) sell her apartment that she lived in with Manny before she married Jay. While they are waiting for their appointment, they go to the neighbour's salon where Gloria used to work. The women who work there are excited to see her and when they ask for her help since one of the girls did not come for work, Gloria agrees to help them out while Phil, who demonstrates experience, does the shampooing. Cam and Mitch arrive at Jay's house and Cam shows everyone the new cake topper. Jay and Mitch conspire about it and Jay says that he has a friend that helps him make things disappear. Cam notices after a while that the topper is gone and Jay blames Stella the dog saying that she buries things in the garden. Cam has to find the topper and he forces Mitch to dig up the whole garden with him till they find it. When they do, Cam reveals his plan to make many miniatures and give them to all their friends at the wedding, something that finally makes Mitch to admit how much he hates the topper. They agree to use one more veto each so Mitch gets rid of the topper and Cam says he wants the wedding singer gone. It is later revealed that Cam was the one who sent the picture to his dad to make the topper, knowing that it would make Mitch mad and he could have one more veto to get rid of the singer. In the meantime, Gloria avoids Phil's reminders that they will miss the appointment with the potential buyer, something that makes Phil understand that Gloria does not really want to sell her old apartment. He manages to make her talk to him and he tells her that when she feels ready to sell, he will be there to help her. They leave the salon and go back home. The whole family is gathered together for Jay's night and when Cam and Mitch bring all the things that Stella \\"buried\\", Gloria realizes that Jay was using the dog to get rid of all the things he hated. Among them is also a gift he got from his employees that makes Claire realize that her father's behavior towards her was because he is not ready to leave the company and let her take over. She reassures him that this will only happen when he feels ready to retire and they make up. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"A Hard Jay's Night\\" was watched by 9.00 million; down by 1.09 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"A Hard Jay's Night\\" received positive reviews with some of the reviewers comparing it with the previous week's episode. Joshua Alston from The A.V. Club gave a B- rating to the episode saying that after last week's episode he was expecting a step down for this week's. \\"It isn’t a terrible episode of the show, but it does return to season five’s meh-just-okay baseline. [...] What I will give \\"A Hard Jay’s Night\\" credit for is its character development, which has generally been spot on this season, even when the plot that gives rise to the forward movement doesn't completely work.\\" Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4/5. Jordan Adler from We Got This Covered gives a good review comparing it with \\"Las Vegas\\" episode. \\"After last week’s manic, high-energy episode that was \\"Las Vegas\\" [...] \\"A Hard Jay’s Night\\" is a rather restrained, merely decent, sort of harmless half hour. If last week's Modern Family was an all-you-can-eat buffet of comedy, this episode is comfort food. The viewer gets exactly what he or she expects and little more.\\"  References   External links  \\"A Hard Jay's Night\\" at ABC.com Category:Modern Family (season 5) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Television programs directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller ","title":"A Hard Jay's Night"},{"id":"42416422","text":"Drupad Borgohain (7 November 1941 – 10 April 2019)Veteran Communist Leader Drupad Borgohain Dies.

Joining the metropolitan army as a private soldier in 1875 he rapidly rose through the ranks and was commissioned into the Troupes de marine (colonial army) in 1880. Serving in the Tonkin War in command of indigenous troops he was wounded during an attack on a fort, he was posted briefly to Senegal before returning to Tonkin in 1890. During the Pacification of Tonkin Rondony distinguished himself, being wounded twice in action, being cited in the order of the day, receiving the Tonkin and Colonial Medals and being appointed a commander of the Order of the Dragon of Annam. Returning to France in 1897 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and saw service in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900-01\\\\. Furthers postings in Tonkin and Madagascar followed before Rondony was promoted to général de brigade in France. Holding command of the 3rd Colonial Brigade upon the start of the First World War he led it in defeat at the Battle of Rossignol on 22 August 1914. Rondony and his divisional commander, Léon Amédée François Raffenel, were killed in action, the first French generals to die during the war.  Early life and non-commissioned career  Born on 6 March 1856 at Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste, Pyrénées-Orientales, to Bonaventure and Julie Tardey Rondony, Rondony enlisted in the French Army's 22nd Line Infantry Regiment as a 2nd class private on 5 November 1875. Rondony soon received promotion, first to corporal on 7 May 1876 and to quartermaster- sergeant on 11 November the same year. He was demoted to sergeant on 26 February 1877 but reappointed quartermaster-sergeant on 26 May. He was appointed to the senior non-commissioned rank of sergeant-major on 14 October 1877 and to adjutant on 6 November 1879.

Rondony served in French Indo-China from 13 January 1883 until 23 May, being promoted to lieutenant in the Tirailleurs Annamites two days later for service in Tonkin. He was wounded in the left shoulder whilst attacking a fort at Dong Lai on 15 May. Rondony transferred to the 2nd Tonkinese Rifles on 16 June 1885, and to the 2nd Marine Infantry on 29 September before his return to France in December of that year. Posted to Senegal on 8 February 1887 he was transferred to the Senegalese Tirailleurs on 21 May. He was appointed a chevalier of the Legion of Honour on 16 June. Remaining in Senegal he was promoted to captain in the 1st Marine Infantry Regiment on 21 February 1888 before leaving for France on 2 March 1889. He was transferred to the 4th Marine Infantry Regiment on 11 April 1890 and to the 3rd Tonkinese Rifles on 16 February 1891, prior to his return to Tonkin on 15 March that year. He was wounded again in the left shoulder on 23 September 1892 at Dong Rhé and once more by a bullet on 11 December 1892. Cited in the Order of the Day on 14 December for \\"great vigour\\" displayed in action at Long-Xa in July and August 1892, he also held the Colonial Medal and the Tonkin Expedition commemorative medal. Remaining in Tonkin Rondony was transferred to the 5th Marine Infantry regiment on 3 March 1893 and to the 9th Marine Infantry Regiment on 1 April 1894, where he received promotion to chef du bataillon on 13 July. He joined the 4th Marine Infantry on 19 July 1894, returned to the 3rd Tonkinese Rifles on 11 January 1896 and to the 2nd Tonkinese Rifles on 23 July that year. Rondony left Tonkin for France on 21 July 1897 where he joined the 1st Marine Infantry Regiment and was married on 18 October 1897. He had received an appointed as commander of the Order of the Dragon of Annam on 4 July 1897. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 8 March 1900 he joined the 17th Marine Infantry during the Boxer Rebellion on 1 July 1900 and served on the staff of the general commanding Indo-China from 24 September to 1 November 1901. Rondony was posted from China to Tonkin, arriving on 8 November 1901 and was again transferred to the 3rd Tonkinese Rifles on 1 February 1902. Leaving for France on 18 May 1902 Rondony was transferred to the 3rd Colonial Infantry Regiment on 31 May and to the 23rd Colonial Infantry Regiment on 16 September 1902. He was appointed an officer of the Legion of Honour on 13 July 1903. Being posted to Madagascar on 10 July 1904 Rondony was transferred to the 13th Colonial Infantry Regiment on 20 September 1904 and promoted Colonel on 21 December. He joined the 1st Tirailleurs Malgaches Regiment on 17 January 1905 and the 7th Colonial Infantry Regiment on 19 August 1906. Returning once more to Tonkin on 29 January 1912 with command of a brigade and a position with the 3rd Colonial Infantry Regiment he received promotion to général de brigade on 18 March 1913. He became a commander of the Legion of Honour on 11 July 1914.  First World War  Holding command of the 3rd Colonial Infantry Brigade (consisting of the 3rd and 7th Colonial Infantry Regiments) upon the French mobilisation in August 1914 he moved his brigade by rail from the south-west of France to the Meuse where it formed part of the 3rd Colonial Division under Général Léon Amédée François Raffenel (along with the 1st Colonial Brigade). Rondony's brigade crossed the Semois River to enter Belgium and confront the invading German army. Engaged at the Battle of Rossignol on 22 August 1914, the 3rd Colonial Division was defeated with heavy losses. Although Rondony's troops fared better than other elements of the division, which ceased to exist as a formed unit, the 3rd Colonial Infantry Regiment lost 2,085 men killed, wounded or missing and the 7th Colonial Infantry Regiment some 1,500. Rondony and Raffenel were amongst those killed, becoming the first French generals to lose their lives during the war. Rondony was cited in a general order of 19 September 1914 for his \\"glorious death\\".

He served as a member of the Politburo of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the ruling communist party in Mongolia, during the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1962, he was expelled as a 'nationalist' from the Politburo after having supported celebrations in honour of the 800th birthday of Genghis Khan. Some time later, he was also expelled from the party, and his life ended in 1985 when he was brutally murdered. Early life Tömör-Ochir grew up as an orphan. Around the age of 15 he rented himself out to shear wool and do other jobs. Some years later he then went on to pursue an education at the then recently founded National University of Mongolia. In 1950 Tömör-Ochir, seen as one of the new Mongolian intellectuals, signed a collective letter in which the possibility of socialism in Mongolia without joining the Soviet Union was doubted. The letter led to an investigation by Mongolian Prime Minister Khorloogiin Choibalsan and nationalist supporters as Choibalsan had recently fallen out with Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union. The later Mongolian Prime Minister Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal did however support Tömör-Ochir during the investigation. In 1953 Tömör-Ochir earned his Master in Philosophy from Moscow State University. In his own country in 1957 he received the title of professor. Political career Tömör-Ochir became politically active during the early years of the Tsedenbal rule. Tsedenbal had succeeded Choibalsan, who died in 1952. Tömör- Ochir became member of the Politburo of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP). By 1956 Tsendenbal started his criticism of intellectuals to which Tömör-Ochir assisted. In 1959, Tömör-Ochir personally joined in this criticism and wrote an article against Mongolian author and linguist Byambyn Rinchen, denouncing him for his nationalism. While at first Tsendenbal was impressed with Tömör-Ochir and his comprehension of the Marxist–Leninist thought he later grew suspicious of him, seeing him as an individualist and nationalist. Tömör-Ochir was however still elected as an academician to the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in 1961. By 1962, he came to retract some of his earlier ideas. He withdrew his earlier support for a unification with the Soviet Union and in book on the history of the MPRP he criticized the non- Marxist early years. In the same year he also wished to see his criticisms of intellectuals and Rinchen withdrawn. 1962 was also the year celebrating 800 years since the birth of Genghis Khan. Several celebrations were planned including a commemorative stamp and series of postcards. A monument of Genghis Khan was also placed in Dadal, his birthplace. Tömör-Ochir joined these celebrations and organized a symposium for academics and scholars on Genghis Khan. The event ended with applause, cheers and chants for Genghis Khan. Informants for the Soviet Union security agency KGB singled out Tömör-Ochir as ringleader. Tsedenbal then had him removed from the Politburo as a 'nationalist' on 10 September 1962. In the autobiography of Jamsrangiin Sambuu, the effective president of Mongolia between 1954 and 1972, he claims that Tömör-Ochir was expelled from power not about the dispute of Genghis Khan, but rather because of differences in opinion regarding Mongolia's role in the Sino-Soviet split between Tömör-Ochir and Tsedenbal. Later life and death After his expulsion from the Politburo, Tömör-Ochir wished to translate Karl Marx's book Das Kapital into Mongolian. His request was refused and he was sent to Bayankhongor Province to lead a construction office. After the office performed poorly, Tömör-Ochir was expelled from the MPRP and later fired from his job. He then returned to the capital city of Ulan Bator where he was jailed briefly only to be sent into internal exile to Khövsgöl Province shortly after. He was allowed to return to Ulan Bator for medical reasons and was later sent to the city of Darkhan in 1968. In Darkhan he worked in a local museum called Friendship while his wife, Ninjbadgar, worked at the polytechnic institute. In 1984, Tsedenbal stepped down as party leader and one year later Ninjbadgar saw a possibility to request an appeal for reconsideration of the case of Tömör-Ochir in Ulan Bator. While she was away, Tömör-Ochir was killed with an axe in his apartment in Darkhan on 2 October 1985. The killer(s) were never caught, and the motive has yet to be revealed. Tömör-Ochir's family blames the KGB.

It was written in 1844 and presented at the Schleswiger Sängerfest. The tune was written by Carl Gottlieb Bellmann (1772–1862). The text had originally been written by Berlin-based lawyer Karl Friedrich Straß (1803–1864) but rewritten by Matthäus Friedrich Chemnitz (1815–1870) shortly before the start of the Sängerfest in order to represent the then atmosphere in a better way. The song expresses the wish for a united, independent and German Schleswig-Holstein.  History  = Middle Ages = Following the death of Adolphus VIII, childless duke of Schleswig and count of Holstein, in 1459 the nobility was keen to preserve the unity of both countries under the rule of one monarch. After the failure of the first attempts to find a successor, the Danish king Christian I came into consideration. In 1460, he was finally elected after having granted certain privileges to the nobility, amongst others the independence of Schleswig and Holstein from the Kingdom of Denmark. According to the Ripener Urkunde, no legal link existed between Schleswig, Holstein and Denkmark, save the personal union. It furthermore assured that „dat se bliven ewich tosamende ungedelt“ (\\"that they [Schleswig and Holstein] remain united forever\\").Sinding, Paul C. History of Scandinavia: From the Early Times of the Northmen and Vikings to the Present Day. New York: John F. Trow & Co., 1866. Page 460. = 19th century = After the wars of liberation against Napoleonic hegemony had caused national bankruptcy for Denmark in 1813, the population of Schleswig and Holstein were taxed stronger than the Danish populace by a currency reform. Thus, the rivalry between Germans and Danes became fiercer.Glenthøj, Rasmus, Morten N. Ottosen. Experiences of War and Nationality in Denmark and Norway, 1807–1815. Palgrave Macmillan, 2014. Page 123. The southern duchies of Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg had already been constituent states of the Holy Roman Empire before 1806 and of the German Confederation in 1815 whereas the Duchy of Schleswig was a Danish fief with the Danish king as duke and liege. In 1840, Danish was introduced as official language in Northern Schleswig but the attempt to make Danish equal to German in the entire duchy failed due to the assembly of estates loyal to the German cause.Mommsen, Theodor. A History of Rome Under the Emperors. Munich: C.H. Beck'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1992. Page 35. For the original German books read History of Rome (Mommsen). = Schleswiger Sängerfest = In the context of the German national movement of the 19th century, Sängerfeste (Festivals of Singers) with a political background took place throughout Germany (for example the Hambacher Fest). Following this tradition, Schleswig had its Sängerfest in 1844 where Matthäus Friedrich Chemnitz presented his song Wanke nicht, mein Vaterland, a rewritten version of a poem by Karl Friedrich Straß, in which he uttered his wish for a united, independent and German Schleswig-Holstein, which is the reason why he famously replaced the comma of Straß's version with a hyphen, thus stressing the union between both countries.Mecking, Sabine, Yvonne Wasserloos (ed.). Musik, Macht, Staat: kulturelle, soziale und politische Wandlungsprozesse in der Moderne. Göttingen: V&R; unipress, 2012. Page 118. His version of the song became immensely popular during the Sängerfest and was promoted to a sort of \\"battle song\\" for freedom and independence. = 1848–1866 = Schleswig- Holstein as a Prussian Province within the German Empire The political tensions culminated in the First Schleswig War of 1848 that ended three years later with the victory of Denmark without resolving the underlying problems. The Danish government pledged to reinstall the Danish state in its former form, thus granting every part of it the same rights.Svendsen, Nick. The first Schleswig-Holstein War. 1848–50. Solihull: Helion & Co., 2008. In 1855, the Danish government designed a bilingual constitution that was rejected by the assembly of estates of Holstein and declared invalid by the Bundestag in Frankfurt three years later. In 1863, Denmark finally introduced a common constitution for both the Kingdom of Denmark and the Duchy of Schleswig. This violation of the agreement of 1851/1852 led to outrage in Germany. As Denmark refused to abolish this constitution in 1864, the Second Schleswig War broke out, this time ending with German victory. Thereafter, Austria and Prussia administered the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg together. After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Prussia annexed the duchies, forming the Province of Schleswig-Holstein.Embree, Michael. Bismarck's First War. The Campaign of Schleswig and Jutland 1864.

It was named by Matthew Flinders for Robert Williams who subsequently lost his life along with seven other crew in the capsize of a cutter launched from HM Sloop Investigator to search for water on 21 February 1802. Since 2004, the island has been part of the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. Description Williams Island which is approximately south-east of Port Lincoln and south-south-east of West Point on the Jussieu Peninsula is broadly a U-shaped island with a maximum height of and an area of . While the island is bordered by cliffs, a bay with a sandy beach on its north coast provides both a sheltered anchorage for most wind directions and a point of access to the island.  Formation, geology and oceanography Williams Island was formed about 9,100 years ago when sea levels began to rise at the start of the Holocene. The island's geological structure consists of an upper platform of calcarenite laying over on \\"a U-shaped ridge of pink granite, dark coloured porphyritic granite gneiss with intrusions by large, dark dolerite dykes.\\" The open end of the \\"U\\" aligns with the island's northern coast. The U-shaped ridge is visible as an \\"encircling wall of steep cliffs and talus slopes\\" over which the \\"calcarenite platform starts as a talus slope of fractured rock and scree or as low cliffs and overhangs\\" thickens into \\"a thick layer of soil\\" covering most of the island. The island rises from the sea floor at approximately over a distance of approximately to . Flora and fauna = Terrestrial plants= As of 1996, a total of 26 plant species was reported as being present. The island's upper platform is dominated by a shrubland of saltbush, dominated by marsh saltbush and grey saltbush while herbfields dominated by austral storksbill are present on low granite outcrops at several locations near the island's south east tip where the underlying granite strata has passed through the island’s calcareous topping. Visitors to the island in 1907 described the island as treeless, but supporting \\"low, stunted saltbush\\". = Terrestrial animals= An account from a 1907 expedition including Sir Douglas Mawson described the island as teeming with snakes, and noted the presence of a large, badly scarred bull seal. As of 1996, a total of one mammal, 11 bird and three reptile species were reported as being present on the island. Of particular note, is the bush rat, the black tiger snake which predates on the bush rat population and short-tailed shearwaters which are reported as using the island as a breeding colony. As of 2013, the island is reported as being an unconfirmed breeding site for flesh- footed shearwaters. In 1907, visitors to the island described it as home to muttonbirds, penguins, large black snakes and plenty of small lizards. Other birds documented during that visit include the little grassbird (Megalorus gramineus) and the Swamp hawk (Circus gouldi). History The island was first sighted by Europeans on 20 February 1802 from HMS Investigator whilst under the command of Matthew Flinders and was named on that day after seaman Robert Williams. Williams subsequently lost his life, presumably drowned, along with seven other members of the crew on 21 February 1802 when one of HMS Investigators cutters capsized near Cape Catastrophe. The island was surveyed by Thomas Lipson, RN in 1840 as part of an ongoing South Australian Government program to map the colony’s waters, identify shipping hazards and assess the suitability of the coastline for settlement. Navigation aids A navigation aid consisting of a tower with a single flashing light was located on the west side of the island since 1963. An area of land of approximately in size is reserved for use by the responsible government agency, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). Access to the Island for the maintenance of the navigation aid is via helicopter. Economic activity = Gauno= Williams Island is one of the island sites from which guano was mined under licence from the South Australian Government prior to 1919. Protected area status Since 30 September 2004, Williams Island has been part of the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. Previously, it had been part of the Lincoln National Park. As of December 2012, the waters surrounding the island are in the Thorny Passage Marine Park.

In 1975, in a national Afrikaans poetry competition for matric pupils, she won a study bursary for four years at the university of her choice. She chose Stellenbosch University, where she participated in D.J. Opperman's poetry workshops and was awarded a BA degree, majoring in Afrikaans and French, in 1978. The following year, she acquired an honours degree in journalism. She completed a master's degree in journalism several years later.

The arguments of Symonds in favour of the colony in 1609, equating the British nation with the biblical Abraham, and stating that Native Americans lacked property rights, have been seen as presaging later developments in the colonisation of North America. Life Born in Hampshire, Symonds matriculated at Oxford on 3 March 1573, and was elected a demy of Magdalen College in 1573, then described as from Oxfordshire. He graduated B.A. on 1 February 1578, was elected a probationer- fellow of Magdalen in 1578, and graduated M.A. on 5 April 1581. In 1583 Symonds was appointed by the President Laurence Humfrey to the mastership of Magdalen College School, where he was in post to 1586. During that time complaints were made against him for non-residence. In 1583 he became rector of Langton-by-Partney, Lincolnshire; in 1584 he was presented by the Queen to the rectory of Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire; on 14 November 1587 he was admitted to the rectory of Stock, Essex, by John Aylmer, the bishop of London. In 1594 Symonds obtained the rectory of Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire; in 1597 he was instituted to the rectory of Well, Lincolnshire; and in 1599 he was presented by Robert Bertie, to the rectory of Halton Holgate, Lincolnshire. Symonds was also for several years preacher at St Saviour's Church, Southwark. He was presented to the rectory of Wyberton, Lincolnshire, in 1612. According to Anthony Wood, he was created D.D. in 1613. He held the living till 1616. Works Symond's works were: *Pisgah Evangelica, according to the Method of the Revelation, presenting the History of the Church, and those Canaanites over whom she shall triumph, London, 1605. A commentary on the Book of Revelation, it terminates its history at the Union of the Crowns in 1603. The work announces a \\"first resurrection\\" as imminent. *A Heavenly Voyce. A Sermon tending to call the people of God from among the Romish Babylonians; preached at Paules Crosse, the 12 of Ianuarie 1606, London, 1606. Virginia (1609)Virginia. A Sermon preached at White-Chappel, in the presence of many honourable and worshipfull, the Adventurers and Planters for Virginia, 25 April 1609. Published for the benefit and vse of the Colony, planted and to bee planted there, and for the Aduancement of their Christian Purpose, London, 1609. was the first sermon preached before the Virginia Company. The text was , God's promise to Abram on his emigration. Related sermons of the time were those by John Donne, which put forward similar religious arguments, and William Crashaw. Symonds invoked the British Constantine as a model for James VI and I, a pacifier and propagator of the Christian gospel. Alluding to the Book of Numbers, he implied that Virginia should be taken as promised land. The sermon has been seen as picking up from the endpoint of Pisgah Evangelica. From some Observations by Symonds, printed in Captain John Smith's General History of Virginia, 1624, it was thought at one time that he had been resident in the Virginia colony; but that is now not thought to be supported by the evidence. He did look over Smith's manuscripts, and helped him in having them published at Oxford (against the wishes of the Company). Symonds has been identified as a ghost-writer of the General History.

It was named by Matthew Flinders in memory of John Little who was one of the eight crew lost from a cutter that capsized sometime after being launched from HM Sloop Investigator to search for water on 21 February 1802. Since 2004, the island has been part of the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. Description Little Island which is located approximately south-east of Port Lincoln and is located north of Lewis Island, has a maximum height of . Access to the island is limited by the absence of a coastline sheltered from swells and tidal streams, and the unsuitability of the island's terrain for the landing of helicopters. Formation, geology and oceanography Little Island was formed about 8400 years ago when sea levels rose at the start of the Holocene. The island is predominantly granite which is eroded to the extent that the island is divided into two sections. Each section has a calcarenite capping that reaches a height of above sea level. The island rises from the seabed at almost vertically on its south east face while the same transition occurs over a distance of almost on its north west face. Flora and fauna As of 1996, the flora is reported as being a shrubland composed of marsh saltbush while the fauna is reported as consisting of the following vertebrate animals: sooty oystercatchers and Pacific gulls and ‘a large colony’ of Australian sea lions. History The island was one of several first sighted by Europeans on Saturday, 20 February 1802, from HMS Investigator whilst under the command of Matthew Flinders entered what is now Spencer Gulf. Flinders named the island on Wednesday, 24 February 1802, in memory of John Little who lost his life, presumably drowned, along with seven other members of the crew on Sunday 21 February 1802 when one of HMS Investigator’s cutters capsized near Cape Catastrophe. Protected areas status Since 30 September 2004, Little Island has been part of the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. Previously, it had been part of the Lincoln National Park. It first obtained protected area status as a fauna conservation reserve declared under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967. As of December 2012, the waters surrounding the island are in the Thorny Passage Marine Park.
