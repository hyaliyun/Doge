He is currently director and coach of the Yale University 8-U and learn-to-skate programs. Previously he was the head coach for Sacred Heart during their transition from Division III to Division I and the shift from the MAAC to Atlantic Hockey. Career Hannah began his college hockey career with Cornell in 1990 joining a strong team that finished second in the ECAC. Though the Big Red fell in the semifinals they squeaked into the NCAA tournament with the final eastern berth. In the first game Hannah's team surprised the western 3rd-seeded Michigan with a 5‚Äì4 win in overtime but lost the next two games by a combined 15‚Äì7 to drop the series. Cornell's record slipped the next season but the Big Red were able to make the conference championship and have a respectable finish to their year. In Hannah's third season the Big Red posted a dismal record, winning only 6 games and failing to even make the conference tournament. There was a small rebound in his senior season, where he was named as team captain, but Cornell was knocked out of the ECAC tournament in the quarterfinals. After graduating with a degree in business management he played two years of professional hockey before retiring. In 1996 Sacred Heart, a program that was only three years old at the time, was looking for its third head coach and Hannah accepted the position. In Hannah's first season he was able to get the Pioneers to post their first winning season and just over a year later Sacred Heart joined the Division I ranks when it became a founding member of the MAAC ice hockey division. Sacred Heart joined the MAAC as an associate member to fulfill the conference's obligation and the inexperience of the program showed their first year when the team went 7‚Äì23‚Äì1. A year later, however, the Pioneers had a winning record and the team continued to post good results. Unfortunately the Pioneers could produce very little postseason success and lost five of their six conference playoffs games. In 2003 both Iona and Fairfield dropped their program and with only one full member left with a hockey program, the MAAC was able to end the division. The remaining nine members then founded a new ice hockey-only conference called Atlantic Hockey. Hannah's team responded positively to the new conference by finishing as runner-up in the first tournament. The Pioneers continued to finish in the middle of the conference for several years until Hannah pushed them to their first 20-win season in 2005‚Äì06 with was matched the following year. Sacred Heart slipped to 8th-place by 2009 and though the team was positioned for a rebound Hannah announced that he was stepping down a month before the 2009‚Äì10 season saying that he wanted to pursue other career options.

Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation.

The son of a mixed-race mother and a Saudi Arabian father, Schiendelman was raised primarily by his grandmother in Tumwater, Washington, where he was a star athlete at Tumwater High School. After attending Washington State University for one year, Schiendelman decided to drop out of college and return to Tumwater, where he worked several jobs and moved in with his grandmother and half-sister. He was last seen by his grandmother on the morning of May 19, 2016, when the two talked in their kitchen before leaving for their respective jobs. On May 20, 2016, Schiendelman's Chrysler Sebring was discovered abandoned along the southbound lane of Interstate 5 in Rochester, Washington, approximately south of his residence in Tumwater, with his wallet, driver's license, and cell phone still inside. Around 2:00 p.m. a witness placed a 9-1-1 call after witnessing Schiendelman's vehicle swerving across three lanes of the interstate; after the vehicle crashed into the center median, the witness stated he saw a man, 6 ft tall and white, exit the vehicle from the passenger side and run into the woods along the interstate. A search was done with cadaver and tracking dogs in those woods for 6 hours but to no avail. Neither Schiendelman nor any evidence of him was found. Some time later, after news of his disappearance began circulating, a witness called in to report seeing Schiendelman on the day his vehicle was found on the highway, though her claim differs from the only other eyewitness who reported seeing him that day. She reported seeing a man resembling Schiendelman standing outside the parked car on Interstate 5 earlier that morning, accompanied by two white men. A sketch was made of one of the unknown men but the identity still remains a mystery. As of 2020, Schiendelman's whereabouts remain unknown. His disappearance was profiled in 2018 on the Investigation Discovery series Disappeared. Timeline =Background= Logan Drew Schiendelman was born June 27, 1996, and raised in Tumwater, Washington by his maternal grandmother, Ginnie Gebo. His father was a Saudi Arabian native who conceived Schiendelman with his mother, Hannah, while visiting the Pacific Northwest on business. According to Gebo, Schiendelman's father left the United States before his birth, and the two never had a relationship. Schiendelman and his older half-sister, Chloe, became legal dependents of their grandmother, Gebo, after Hannah decided to move to Seattle to attend art school. Schiendelman attended Tumwater High School, where he had been a star defensive back on the school's football team and a model student. Schiendelman's mother, Hannah, lived nearby in Olympia throughout most of his life. As Schiendelman became a teenager, his grandmother stated that he experienced an \\"identity crisis\\" due to being mixed-race; Schiendelman's mother was half-white and half-black, while his father was a Saudi native, and he had been primarily raised by his white grandmother. After graduating high school in 2015, Schiendelman enrolled at Washington State University, approximately away in Pullman. He completed one year of his studies before deciding to return to Tumwater and drop out of college. After Schiendelman left college, he moved in with his grandmother Gebo and half-sister Chloe. Gebo stated she was aware he had been smoking marijuana at the time, which she worried was causing him to suffer from slight paranoia. \\"He was kind of at a loss with what he was going to do with his life,\\" she recalled. In Tumwater, Schiendelman worked several odd jobs, which included at a laundering facility and laboring on his great-aunt's farm. =Disappearance= On the morning of May 19, 2016, Schiendelman spoke with his grandmother, Gebo, while the two prepared for their respective jobs; Gebo recalled of their conversation: \\"He was just really nervous, which he isn‚Äôt usually, kind of on a mission.\\" She also stated he had claimed to have had an \\"epiphany.\\" Gebo told Schiendelman that they could continue their conversation later that evening before departing for her job at the Washington State Department of Ecology. After Schiendelman failed to arrive home, Gebo tracked his cell phone, and saw it had pinged near Olympia; this led her to assume he was visiting his mother there. By the following day, May 20, Schiendelman failed to return home, and Gebo attempted to report him missing, but found the Thurston County Police Department closed for the weekend. On Monday, May 23, she filed a missing persons report; upon doing so, she was notified that Schiendelman's car, a black 1996 Chrysler Sebring, had been impounded on May 20. The vehicle had been found parked at milepost 92 alongside southbound Interstate 5 between Tumwater and Maytown. His personal items including his wallet, several bags of food, and cell phone were all found in his car, which had been directly turned over to Gebo from the impound lot. Inside Schiendelman's wallet was his debit card, driver's license, and $25 in cash. =Investigation= Witness sightings Shortly after Schiendelman's disappearance, several witnesses came forward to Thurston County Police stating they had witnessed Schiendelman's vehicle on Interstate 5 the morning of May 20: A woman driving on the interstate that morning reported seeing Schiendelman with two caucasian men standing at the back of his car, which was parked on the right shoulder of the interstate near Exit 95. She recalled seeing the car in the same location when returning home that evening, but this time with the hood lifted, and no one visibly present. She described one of the men as being around tall with a thin build, blond hair in a bowl cut, and wearing a tank top and jean shorts that were too small for him. The other man was described as having shoulder-length blond hair, and wearing a flannel shirt with jeans. On June 30, 2017, law enforcement released a police sketch of the former man. Around 2:00 p.m. on May 20, three individuals called 9-1-1 to report a car matching Schiendelman's drifting across the lanes of Interstate 5 between Tumwater and Maytown, near the milepost where Schiendelman's car had been discovered. The witnesses reported that the car veered across three lanes toward the center divider, hitting the concrete barrier and stopping. No one appeared to be driving the car. A truck driver passing by reported seeing a caucasian man with brown or red hair jumping out of the vehicle's passenger side and running into the woods on the side of the interstate. Later in the evening of May 20, there was a potential sighting of a naked teenager in the area, though the identity of the individual is unknown; Thurston County Detective Frank Frawley stated: \\"We thought that might have been Logan... And so they did initiate a search using dogs. They didn't locate anything. Could've been Logan, could've been anybody.\\" The last clothing Schiendelman was known to be wearing included a black windbreaker, a white shirt, jeans, and possibly a pair of Nike tennis shoes. Initial investigation Schiendelman's uncle, Mike Ware, a retired Thurston County sheriff, assisted in organizing search efforts for his nephew. Searches focused on a radius surrounding the interstate where Schiendelman's car had been discovered, specifically the woods adjacent to the shoulder of the interstate. Searches were done both on foot and by aircraft, but no sign of Schiendelman was found. In June 2016, Ware told NBC News: \\"The area is extremely thick and brushy. I‚Äôve spent hours out there searching myself. Canines were brought in to search and it‚Äôs been covered extensively. But nothing has been found.\\" The Schiendelman family subsequently hired a private investigator to research his disappearance, but noted that \\"little information\\" was available, making search efforts difficult. Because Schiendelman's vehicle had been impounded and had not been processed by a crime lab, any potential evidence inside was rendered unusable. Using cell phone records, law enforcement were able to track Schiendelman's movements on the morning of May 20, which showed he had traveled towards Interstate 5 heading south; he then turned around and headed north before reversing direction again, heading south on Interstate 5 and eventually stopping where his vehicle was recovered. Early in the investigation, law enforcement questioned the boyfriend of Schiendelman's half-sister, who had recently moved into their household. Tension between Schiendelman and her boyfriend prompted detectives to question him, though he was ruled out as having any involvement in Schiendelman's disappearance after passing a polygraph examination. Facebook check-in On May 27, 2016, one week after Schiendelman disappeared, someone checked in to the Olympia Regional Airport on Schiendelman's personal Facebook page. It turned out the post was celebrating an airport check-in from the year before. Publicity Following Schiendelman's disappearance, his family launched a large internet campaign asking the community for information in his disappearance. A Facebook page was established, which had grown to over 6,500 members by June 2016. Local volunteers helped raise $10,000 in reward funds by selling bracelets bearing his name at Tumwater High School. Among these fundraisers were a large garage sale of donated items which was held in Olympia in August 2016. Schiendelman's disappearance was profiled on the Investigation Discovery docu-series Disappeared on April 8, 2018.

According to another, the arrival of so many Spaniards nearly doubled the population of the island which was already at the subsistence level, and although the Spanish paid well for what they took, competition with the local families for resources became scarce over time, and some soldiers, weakened by lack of food and water, may even have been murdered by the locals.

Preacher Mountain in spring Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago.

History A request for proposal for development and maintenance of a next-generation nuclear ICBM was made by the US Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, ICBM Systems Directorate, GBSD Division in July 2016. The GBSD would replace the Minuteman III, which was first deployed in 1970, in the land-based portion of the US nuclear triad. The new missiles, to be phased in over a decade from the late 2020s, are estimated over a fifty-year life cycle to cost around $86 billion. Boeing and Northrop Grumman competed for the contract. In August 2017, the Air Force awarded 3-year development contracts to Boeing and Northrop Grumman for $349 million and $329 million, respectively.Aaron Gregg Washington Post (21 August 2017) \\"Pentagon narrows competition for the next big U.S. nuclear missile\\" One of these companies was to be selected to produce a ground-based nuclear ICBM in 2020. In 2027, the GBSD program is expected to enter service and remain active until 2075. On 25 July 2019, Boeing announced it would not place a bid for the program, citing Northrop's recent acquisition of Orbital ATK (now Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems), Boeing's supplier of solid rocket motors. Northrop signed an agreement to firewall Boeing's proprietary data after acquiring Orbital ATK. The Air Force has since halted funding for the Boeing project, leaving only Northrop Grumman as a bidder. In December 2019, it was announced that Northrop Grumman won the competition to build the future ICBM. Northrop won by default, as their bid was the only bid left to be considered for the GBSD program. The Air Force said that they will \\"proceed with an aggressive and effective sole-source negotiation\\" in reference to Northrop's bid. On 8 September 2020 the Department of the Air Force awarded Northrop Grumman a $13.3 billion contract to develop the GBSD intercontinental ballistic missile.https://spacenews.com/northrop-grumman- receives-13-3-billion-contract-to-develop-next-generation-icbm/ Warhead In March 2019 the W87 mod 1 thermonuclear warhead was selected for GBSD, replacing the W78 warhead currently used in Minuteman III.

He appeared mostly at Drury Lane and Haymarket in minor to supporting roles, but also had prominent roles in plays like Volpone and Hamlet. Early life Parsons was born to William and Elizabeth (n√©e Latter) Parsons in 1736. His father William did carpentry work in Bow Lane, Cheapside and City of London; his mother Elizabeth was from Maidstone. Parsons attended St Paul's School where surveyor Sir Henry Cheere or Cheke was his instructor. Parsons took part in amateur entertainment with William Powell and Charles Holland. In 1756, Parsons played Kent in King Lear in Haymarket. Professional career = Earlier roles = Parsons's first professional role was that of Southampton in poet Henry Jones's Earl of Essex play in York. Most of his work during this time was high comedy and tragedy. Under the guidance of West Digges, Parsons acted at the Theatre Royale Edinburgh in 1757-8. More roles soon followed for Parsons such as the role of Don Felix in Wonder, Charino in Love Makes a Man, and Grigg in Beggar's Wedding. = 1760s and more prominent roles = Edmund Burton as Subtle (left), Parsons as Face (centre) and alt=three actors in period costume posing comically In 1763, Parsons began working with David Garrick, when Parsons played Filch in The Beggar's Opera at Drury Lane. Parsons would appear in over 200 roles at Drury Lane over the years, mostly in supporting or non important roles. Parsons took on the role of the original Nicodemus in Elizabeth Griffith's play Platonick Wife in January 1765 before appearing for the first time at the Haymarket in the role of Dr. Catgut in Foote's The Commissary later that same year. Parsons would appear regularly at the Haymarket during the summers, introducing characters in new comedies. During that season, Parsons appeared in Henry IV, Part 1 as Douglas, in Hamlet as Rosencrantz, in Love Makes a Man and as Robert in All in the Wrong. Parsons took on more character driven roles in this time period, with character driven roles such as the snitch-servant Blunt in The London Merchant and as Lord Plausible in Plain Dealer to appearing as Gobbo in The Merchant of Venice and Sir William Meadows in Love in a Village. In 1767, Parsons played his most substantial role, Polonius, in Hamlet = 1770s = Parsons as Periwinkle in A Bold Stroke for a Wife, 1777 Parsons took on his first Christmas role, appearing as the original Faladel in the Christmas Tale in 1773. This kept the trend going of Parsons playing original roles. Parsons took on one of his more prominent military roles in the 1770s, playing a decadent General Worry in Rival Candidates. He would continue the trend of playing military-court roles in this time period when he appeared in Runaway as the original Justice and as old Colonel Lovemore in the Contract which brought Parsons back to the Haymarket in June 1776. During the 1776-77 season, Parsons kept churning out original roles at Drury Lane, appearing as Sir Jacob Thrift in Hotel or Double Valet, Doctor Probe in Trip to Scarborough, and as the gossip Crabtree in The School for Scandal. Parsons took a step back in this period, playing smaller parts. Parsons also returned to the Haymarket with the trend of original roles at the theatre, playing Tony Lumpkin in Tony Lumpkin in Town. As the 1770s gave way to the 1780s, Parsons was appearing in plays such as The Lord of the Manor. = Later career = Parsons played legal roles later in his career such as playing an attorney in Divorce, and a Justice in both Love in a Village and in A New Way to pay Old Debts. Around this time, Parsons played Bale in Fair American. Sheridan double bill at Drury Lane, 1785: Parsons as Crabtree in The School for Scandal and Sir Fretful Plagiary in The Critic Parsons moved on and appeared in The Good-Natur'd Man as Twitch. Other plays that Parsons appeared in during this time included The Clandestine Marriage, Measure for Measure and Variety. Of his performance as Lord Ogleby in The Clandestine Marriage in 1784, the reviewer in a London newspaper wrote, \\"This very favourite actor, whose merit is so extensive, and whose reception by the town is equal to his merit, can hardly assume any shape in which he will not display talents of pure comedy\\".\\"Theatre: Haymarket\\", Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser, 20 August 1784, p. 2 Unlike the previous decades, Parsons scarcely played original characters in his later career. Parsons appeared in these original roles at the Haymarket which included him playing mogul-Pope Johnny Atkins in Mogul Tale or the Descent of the Balloon, the begging Squire Codger in Beggar on Horseback, Mr Euston in I'll tell you What, the servant Rohf in Disbanded Officer, Governor of Jamaica Sir Christopher Curry in Inkle and Yarico and lowly regarded but fashionable Alscrip in The Heiress. Most of these roles featured Parsons playing lowly characters. During the last years of his life, Parsons refused to quit acting, appearing in Poor Old Drury as Cobb and in Fugitives as Old Manly, the latter in August 1792. His last roles at the Haymarket Theatre occurred in June 1792 where he played Toby Thatch in London Hermit and as Lope Tocho in Mountaineers (which also was Parson's last original part). After Parsons appeared in the Confederacy as Moneytrap, he played his last role: Sir Fretful Plagiary in The Critic. Style While Parsons's rivals possessed singing talent that eluded him, Parsons relied on his mental talents as seen in his role in Peeping Tom and his exclaiming abilities as seen in Volpone (one of his most notable roles), The Confederacy and The Village Lawyer to get ahead. Parsons's niche was playing elderly men like Whittle in Irish Widow, and Colonel Oldboy in Lionel and Clarissa or playing country clowns like Scrub in The Stratagem. In 1812, the author of Biographia Dramatica, called Parsons \\"a comic actor of superlative merit\\", and added, \\"In the conception and execution of such characters as Foresight, in Love for Love; Corbaccio in Volpone; Sir Fretful Plagiary in The Critic, &c.; we never expect to see his equal\\". Painting career Besides being an actor, Parsons was also a painter and a painting judge. Parsons contributed some of his pictures to the Society of Artists and the Free Society of Artists. Some of Parsons's subjects were architectural displays and landscapes such as views of Richmond. Parsons's paintings included the Spaniards Inn St Paul's, Hampstead, St George Fields's Frog Hall amongst other subjects. Parsons's painting style was inspired by Richard Wilson. Parsons was acquainted with several prominent painters of the late eighteenth century. Parsons bought many paintings of first masters at brokers shops which he would later sell for large sums of money. Personal life and death On 21 September 1762, Parsons married Mary Price, who was in the play The Beggar's Opera with him. After Parsons's first wife died in 1787, he remarried Dorothy or Dorthea. Parsons had one child, a son named Stewart. On 3 February 1795, Parsons died, partially due to his asthma at his home in Mead's Row Lambeth. His tomb in Lee, Kent currently has a rhymed epitaph over it. Parsons left his leasehold estate Stangate and his small Bearsted freehold to his son Stewart. Parsons left 591 per annum and leasehold houses in London Road and his leasehold estate in Mead's to his wife.

A good many of her productions were of a devotional character and included mingled piety and charity, traits she probably inherited from her father. Many of her fugitive pieces were published by the Louisville Journal, the Odd Fellows' Ark, at Columbus, Ohio, and other periodicals. Early life and education Amanda Louise Ruter was born in Jeffersonville, Indiana, February 26, 1822. She was the oldest daughter of Rev. Calvin Washington Ruter, one of the pioneers of Methodism in Indiana. With his brother, the Rev. Dr. Martin Ruter, the two men were among the most highly educated and eminent ministers of the Methodist Church, who, at an early day, brought the foundations of that religion to the valley of the Mississippi River. Her mother was Harriet De Haas Ruter. The father was of Vermont and Puritan ancestry, and the mother was of Virginia and Huguenot ancestry. One of her siblings was the writer, Rebecca Ruter Springer. The years of her earliest childhood were spent on a farm near Lexington, Indiana. Adjacent to the house was a beautiful woodland pasture, in which had been rudely constructed a rustic bower; and there the solitary child used to sit alone for hours, while rhymes came to her even before she could read. When she was eight years of age, her father removed to New Albany, Indiana where her youth was passed. Conflicting circumstances conspired materially to influence her character. On the one hand her father, a man of melancholy temperament and studious habits, required absolute quiet in his household; and this gave the child many hours for lonely reflection and for the study of books. She began to commit her own thoughts to paper, and these usually assumed a poetical form. She possessed herself of some elementary Latin works from her father's library, and sought to teach herself that language. But her mother's health failing, so that many of the domestic duties devolved on her child, she was forced to stay away from books and writing materials, lest the household chores should be neglected. After a time the daughter was sent to such a school as, in those early days, was to be found; and there the avidity with which she applied her mind to study injured her health. She persevered, however, until she had acquired all that her teachers could communicate, and had herself mastered the usual qualifications of a teacher. Of these, as her father's flock was poor and his means limited, she subsequently availed herself, keeping school at Rising Sun, in order to aid her parents and to procure, for herself, the means of purchasing the books she craved. Career Dufour had an early and earnest desire to travel; to witness, in other lands, the scenes and wonders of which she had read; and there to gather that varied knowledge and experience which at home, except through reading, was beyond our reach. But her wishes were not destined to be gratified. She grew up to adult age without having once left her native State. In 1842, she married Oliver Dufour, then of New Albany, Indiana, but formerly of Vevay, Indiana. Her husband was the son of John Francis Dufour, from Montreux near Vevey, Switzerland. This gentleman came to the West in 1801, when it was all a wilderness. In 1809, he settled on the spot where Vevay (Indiana) now stands, then a dense, unbroken forest; and he laid out the town in 1813, calling it after his beautiful native place, on the Leman Lake. He was the first settler west of the mountains who ever made wine. He sent a sample of the first vintage to Thomas Jefferson, then President. It so happened that about the same time, someone had sent to the President a bottle of water from the Mississippi River. The water and wine, both from the Western wilderness, were united, and were drank together. Oliver Dufour was elected to the Indiana Legislature in 1853. He was a prominent member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, having been Grand Master of the State of Indiana, Grand Representative from that State and also from the District of Columbia for eight consecutive years. He died in November, 1891. In 1854, he received from President Franklin Pierce an appointment in the General Land Office,in Washington, D.C., to which place he removed with his family. Until the removal to Washington, consequent upon this appointment, Amanda Dufour had remained a resident of Indiana. She was, therefore, a woman of the West, by birth, by education, by marriage, and by residence, and her poetical talents were exclusively of Western culture. Still, under every discouragement, she wrote, \\"Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh.\\" Amanda Louise Ruter Dufour Dufour composed verses from a young age. Her peculiarly sensitive temperament long kept her talents from being appreciated. Having no confidence in her own abilities, she shrank from criticism. She was fond of writing for children, and published many poems adapted to their comprehension. In 1848, Hon. Joseph A. Wright, then governor of the State, sent from Indiana, for the Washington monument, a block of marble, on which was inscribed the motto: \\"No North, No South, Nothing but the Union.\\" This incident suggested to Dufour her poem entitled \\"The Ark of the Union.\\" It was first published in the Washington Union, and was afterward, without her knowledge, set to music. Some months before the death of the scientist, Baron Von Humboldt, Mrs. Dufour wrote a poem on his distinction as \\"King of Science.\\" She contributed to the Ladies' Repository, the Masonic Review, the School Day Visitor, the Republican, of Springfield, Ohio, the Louisville Journal, whose editor was the author and poet, George D. Prentice, and the Louisville Democrat. Contemporaries in time and similar in style and sentiment expressed were Julia Louisa Dumont and Mary Louisa Chitwood. In later years, owing chiefly to ill health, she was less conspicuous in the literary world. Dufour died in Washington, D.C., May 29, 1899, and was buried at that city's Rock Creek Cemetery. Style and themes Many of her productions were of a devotional character, mingled with piety and charity, which she may have inherited from her father. Her lines on \\"Thought,\\" fraught with genuine feeling and characterized by graceful imagery, were from an elaborate poem unpublished. A wild tone of sadness runs through many of this author's pieces, whether, like her piety, a paternal inheritance, or whether born of sad experiences of the world that so often tell upon a sensitive and poetic nature can only be conjectured. But there was nothing, however, of idle and sickly sentimentality in this strain of sadness; its breath came from a heart strengthened by hope and courage, for all the duties of life. Her lines entitled \\"Confession\\" might alone establish Mrs. Dufour's title to the inborn poetic temperament. There was no true poet who, in moments of inspiration, had not embodied and addressed the ideal. And there was no better test of the depth and purity of the poetic vein than the tone and manner of such an address. Its impassioned lines were wont to disclose all that was noblest at once and warmest, in the inner heart of the writer; and in them, therefore, the reader sought, with best chance of obtaining a clue to the just appreciation of the character, and just estimate of the genius which thus conceived and pictured, not what is, but what might be; not what could be found in this world, but still, what could be imagine, and may hope, perhaps, to meet with in another.

With a slight variation in the 5th contract. The special feature of this game is that it consists of a compendium of five different deals. In the first four it is a trick-taking game; the fifth contract is a melding game, rather like Elfer Raus (\\"Eleven Out\\"). If it is played for money, small stakes (e.g. 5 cents) are paid into a pot during the trick-taking games and the money is paid out in the last game. The word \\"pfennig\\" is used here to mean the stake.  Cards  Kein Stich is normally played with a pack of 32 German-suited cards. French playing cards may also be used. The cards rank as follows: Ace/Deuce, King, Ober/Queen, Unter/Jack, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven.  Rules  The following describes the most common variant, which is for 4 players who are dealt 8 cards each. There are four trick-taking deals during which players contribute 160 pfennigs to the pot, followed by a lay-off deal in which they compete to win the contents of the pot. The player to the left of the dealer leads to the first trick. Thereafter, the winner of a trick leads to the next one. The fundamental rule is that players must follow suit (this is known as Farbzwang); there are no trumps. That means that if a player has at least one card of the led suit, it must be played. Tricks are won by the highest card of the led suit. The five deals are: Cards after melding in the fifth deal # No Tricks (Kein Stich): In the first deal, players aim to take as few tricks as possible. Each trick taken costs 5 pfennigs. # No Hearts (Kein Herz): In the second deal, players pay a penalty of 5 pfennigs for each Heart card they take. The number of tricks taken is irrelevant. But Hearts are not trumps, so Heart cards may be discarded to a trick led by another suit, if the player cannot follow suit. # No Obers (Kein Ober): In the third deal, the Hearts and the number of tricks won are unimportant. This time, each Ober captured costs 10 pfennigs. # No Max (Kein Herz-K√∂nig): In the fourth deal it is now important not to capture \\"Max\\", the King of Hearts, well known from the card game, Watten. He costs 40 pfennigs. # Domino (Legerunde): In the fifth and last deal, which is basically the Domino-type game of Unteransetzen, the player who is dealt the Unter of Acorns (or in a French pack, the Jack of Clubs) leads, by playing it to the table. Each player in turn must either lay off a card to the Unter of Acorns or play another Unter. If neither is possible, they pass. Whoever, is the first out, wins 100 pfennigs; the second out wins 50; the third, 10, and the last out gets nothing. The stakes and the winnings, etc., should be agreed by the players beforehand. In other variants, the player with the Unter of Hearts leads off. Depending on which Unter is selected to be first the contract may be known locally as Eichelunteranlegen (Unter of Acorns leads) or Herzunteranlegen (Unter of Hearts leads).  Variants  = Alternative deals = * Black Pig. In the variant known as Black Pig (Schwarze Sau) the Queen of Spades takes the place of \\"Max\\" in the fourth deal.In Kartenspiele f√ºr jung und alt, Buch und Zeit- Verlagsgesellschaft, Cologne, 1973, called \\"B√∂se Dame\\" on p. 116. c.f. Hearts. = Four deals = * King Louis: the first deal is omitted and the game starts with No Hearts. The number of points or pfennigs available in the final lay- off deal reduces correspondingly to 120. = Six deals = In six-deal versions, the number of points or pfennigs won in the final lay-off deal rises to 200. * No Penultimate Trick (Kein zweitletzter Stich) involves an additional trick-taking deal in which the penultimate trick costs 40 pfennigs. * No First or Last Trick (Kein erster, letzter Stich) is like the preceding variant, except that players aim to avoid taking the first and last tricks, which each cost 20 pfennigs. = Two deals = * Power, Blitz or Hardcore The first four deals are combined into one and players pay a penalty for: each trick taken, each Heart card, each Ober and the King of Hearts. For example, if the following trick is won - D10px, O10px, 1010px, K10px it costs 1 stake for the trick, 4 for the Hearts, 2 for the Ober of Hearts and 8 for the King of Hearts. = Additional rules = * March: players may score for a march (Durchmarsch) in all the trick-taking rounds. If a player wins every trick, they win 50 pfennigs and the others pay 30 pfennigs each. = Others = Variants exist for 3 to 6 players and for playing with 24 or 52 cards.

The stamps, printed in great profusion in the 1960s, are mostly near-worthless today.  History  An Ajman 'Dunes' stamp, as with all of these collector's editions, irrelevant in subject matter to the state they purport to originate from. Britain managed the Trucial States' external relations (a result of the 1892 'Exclusive Agreement' treaty), including the management of posts and telegraphs - the states were not members of the UPO - the Universal Postal Union). The Government of India opened its first post office in Dubai in 1941 and its operation was taken over by British Postal Agencies, a subsidiary of the GPO (General Post Office) in 1948. Stamps of the time were British stamps surcharged with Rupee values, until in 1959 a set of 'Trucial States' stamps was issued from Dubai. In 1963, Britain ceded responsibility for the Trucial States' postal systems to the Rulers of the Trucial States. An American philatelic entrepreneur, Finbar Kenny, saw the opportunity to create a number of editions of stamps aimed at the lucrative collector's market and in 1964 concluded a deal with the cash-strapped emirate of Ajman to take the franchise for the production of stamps for the government. Kenny had made something of a specialty out of signing these deals, also signing with the Ruler of Fujairah in 1964, and getting involved in a bribery case in the USA over his dealings with the government of the Cook Islands. These stamps, luridly illustrated and irrelevant to the actual emirates they came from (editions included 'Space Research' and 'Tokyo Olympic Games', with two odd editions issued from Umm Al Qawain including 'British Kings and Queens' and, with summer temperatures in Umm Al Qawain reaching 50¬∞ C, 'Winter Olympics'), became known collectively as 'dunes'.  Value  Manama post office today. The sale of postage stamps was for a short time a lucrative trade for the emirates, most of whom (with the exception of Abu Dhabi, which struck oil in 1965) had few other sources of revenue. Revenues of up to ¬£70,000 for the poorer states fell, however, to ¬£30,000 with the inevitable saturation of the market. Their sale by 1966 constituted the main source of revenue for the northern Trucial States. Their proliferation eventually devalued them and, because of this, many popular catalogues today do not even list them. Among these editions, following the opening of a 'post office' in Manama on July 5, 1966, were nine editions published from 'Manama, Dependency of Ajman'. Few collectors would realise Manama was a remote agricultural village consisting of a few adobe houses on a plain overlooked by the Hajar Mountains. Kenny's arrangements ended when the United Arab Emirates was formed in 1971.

He showed good form as a three-year-old when he won three races including the Listed Grand Prix de la Region des Pays de La Loire and was placed in the Gordon Stakes, Prix Kergorlay and Prix de Lut√®ce. In the following year he ran third in the Prix Kergorlay and the Prix Gladiateur before recording his biggest win when he defeated a very strong field of stayers to take the Prix du Cadran. He was then sold and exported to Australia where he had no success. Background Chief Contender was a bay horse bred in Ireland by Jayeff 'B' Stables & Calogo Bloodstock A G. As a yearling he was sent to the United States and offered for sale at Keeneland where he was bought for $385,000 by George Harris Bloodstock. He entered the ownership of a partnership including Susan Magnier, Robert Sangster and Richard Santulli. The colt was sent into training with Peter Chapple-Hyam at Manton, Wiltshire. He was from the eighth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 and went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Chief Condender's dam Minnie Hauk was a daughter of the influential broodmare Best In Show, whose other descendants included El Gran Senor, Try My Best, Xaar, Jazil, Rags to Riches and Redoute's Choice. Minnie Hauk had previously produced the successful racehorse and broodmare Aviance. Racing career =1996: three-year-old season= Chief Contender did not race as a two-year-old and began his racing career by finishing ninth in a maiden race over one and a half miles at Newmarket Racecourse on 16 April 1996. On his next appearance on 5 May the colt ran in a maiden over the same distance at Salisbury Racecourse in which he was ridden by the apprentice jockey Robert Havlin and started at odds of 10/1 in a ten-runner field. He took the lead from the start and recorded his first success as he drew away from his opponents in the final furlong came home nine lengths clear of Wilawander. Havlin was again in the saddle when Chief Contender started 5/6 favourite for a minor race over the same course and distance. The colt again made all the running and won by three and a half lengths from the Michael Stoute trained Yom Jameel. In the 1996 Epsom Derby Chief Contender started the 15/1 eighth choice in a twenty-runner field and was ridden by David Harrison. He raced close to the leaders before tiring in the last quarter mile and finishing ninth behind Shaamit, beaten nine lengths by the winner. On 7 July Chief Contender was sent to France for the Listed Grand Prix de la Region des Pays de La Loire at Nantes in which he was again partnered by Harrison. Racing on very soft ground over 2400 metres and won by one and a half lengths from Faucon Royal. On his next race the colt contested the Group 3 Gordon Stakes (a trial race for the St Leger) over one and a half miles at Goodwood and finished and finished second, beaten a neck by St Mawes. He was back in France on 18 August for the Prix Kergorlay, a race which saw him moved up in distance to 3000 metres and matched against older horses for the first time. He disputed the lead for most of the way but came home third behind the Kassani and Nononito after tiring in the last 200 metres. His third trip to France produced a similar result as he led for most of the way in the Prix de Lut√®ce at Longchamp Racecourse before being overtaken in the closing stages and finishing third to Tarator. Chief Contender ended his season with a disappointing effort as he ran unplaced in the St Simon Stakes at Newbury Racecourse on 26 October. =1997: four-year-old season= Chief Contender began his third campaign on 19 April in the John Porter Stakes at Newbury in which he finished unplaced, more than twenty lengths behind the winner Whitewater Affair. After an absence of over four months the colt returned for a second run in the Prix Kergorlay at Deauville Racecourse in August and, after disputing the lead for most of the way, took third place behind Classic Cliche and Orchestra Stall. In the Prix Gladiateur over 3100 metres at Longchamp on 7 September he came home third behind Orchestra Stall and Double Eclipse. On 4 October at Longchamp he was one of four British challengers in a seven-runner field for the Group 1 Prix du Cadran. Celeric started favourite ahead of Always Earnest (winner of the race in 1997), Persian Punch and Double Trigger with Chief Contender (ridden by Olivier Doleuze) the 11.4/1 fifth choice in the betting. After racing in third place behind Persian Punch and Double Trigger he was switched to the outside and began to stay on strongly. Chief Contender overtook Persian Punch 100 metres from the finish and held off the late challenge of Celeric to win by a neck. Peter Chapple-Hyam had originally planned for the colt to race from the front but changed his instructions to the jockey just before the race. He explained \\"I was a little worried about him staying the trip in a truly run race, hence the change of plan. And early on I wasn't too happy as he had his ears flat back. He's a bit of a character at home and a hard ride, but he's a tough sort of horse and did it well in the end\\". On 27 October Chief Contender was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was bought for 225,000 guinea by the bloodstock agents Cormac McCormack Associates. Chief Contender was exported to race in Australia but made no impact, finishing tailed-off last in the Sydney Cup on 18 April 1998.

During World War II he flew with No. 3 Squadron, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), and commanded No. 452 Squadron, receiving a Mention in Despatches. He led No. 77 Squadron in the opening months of the Korean War, and was awarded a bar to his DFC, as well as the US Legion of Merit and the US Air Medal, for his leadership. Born in Bundaberg, Queensland, Spence worked in a bank before joining the RAAF in March 1940. In August the following year he was posted to North Africa with No. 3 Squadron, which operated P-40 Tomahawks and Kittyhawks against German and Italian forces; he was credited with shooting down two German aircraft. Spence commanded No. 452 Squadron in 1944, flying Supermarine Spitfires in defence of Australia's North-Western Area against the Japanese. After a brief return to civilian life following World War II, he rejoined the RAAF in October 1946. He took command of No. 77 Squadron, operating P-51 Mustangs as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, in February 1950. The squadron went into action within a week of the outbreak of the Korean War in June. Spence was killed during a low-level mission over South Korea in September 1950.

Stratemeyer, commander of the US Far East Air Force, cleared the RAAF of blame.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 226Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 35 Spence was recommended for the US Air Medal for \\"meritorious service\\" in operations from 25 June to 15 July. His increasingly heavy taskload included diplomatic duties and public relations, as well as squadron administration and many combat sorties.Odgers, Mr Double Seven, p. 78 No. 77 Squadron did not encounter enemy aircraft in the opening phase of the war, but often faced intense ground fire.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 227 During July and August 1950, equipped with bombs, rockets and napalm, the Mustangs supported UN troops retreating before the North Korean advance.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 92‚Äì94 According to the official history of the Air Force in 1946‚Äì1971, the squadron's part in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter earned recognition \\"not only for the RAAF but also Australia at the highest political levels in the United States\\". On 15 August, Prime Minister Robert Menzies presented the Gloucester Cup to No. 77 Squadron as the RAAF's most proficient unit of the past year. General Stratemeyer arrived at Iwakuni a week later to surprise Spence with the award of the US Legion of Merit for \\"outstanding leadership in the preparation of his unit for combat\\".Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 55Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 95 On 9 September, in cloudy conditions, Spence led three other Mustangs in a low-level napalm attack on An'gang-ni. He attempted to pull out of a very steep dive but crashed in the middle of the town and was killed.Wilson, The Brotherhood of Airmen, p. 160 Whether he was hit by ground fire or had misjudged his attack is uncertain.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 61 Spence's wife and children were still living at Iwakuni, and his death hastened the departure for Australia of all families on the base.Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 97 He was succeeded by Squadron Leader Dick Cresswell, who had twice commanded No. 77 Squadron during World War II.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 62‚Äì64 Cresswell commented that \\"thanks to Lou Spence\\", the squadron \\"was led perfectly in all the jobs it did\\".Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 64 Legacy According to his brother, quoted in the Brisbane Courier-Mail, Spence wrote in his last letter home: Flight Lieutenant (later Air Vice-Marshal) Fred Barnes described Spence's death as having \\"a tremendous impact ... He was very popular and respected as a professional. It was accepted that he was on the way to high rank.\\" The official history of the post-war Air Force contended that Spence \\"appeared destined for the highest levels of the RAAF\\". Stratemeyer rated him \\"one of the most capable field commanders I have been associated with\\", and \\"one of the noblest and finest officers of any service\\". Spence was recommended for the Distinguished Service Order for his \\"outstanding fearless leadership and distinction\\" in Korea, but the award was changed to a bar to his DFC. The decoration was promulgated in The London Gazette on 17 April 1951 and presented to his wife on 22 February 1952. His awards of the US Legion of Merit and Air Medal were gazetted on 22 June 1951; the latter was presented privately to Vernon Spence. Advancing UN troops located Spence's body near his crashed Mustang in October 1950. He is buried at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan, South Korea.

It was designed by Sir John Sulman and built from 1888 to 1889. It is also known as Christ Church of England and Springwood. The property is owned by Springwood Anglican Parish. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The church was designed by Sir John Sulman, who worked in Australia from 1885 and who had a nearby holiday residence in Lawson.Robert Staas, funding application letter, 11/2010 The major part of his practice was in commercial, institutional and ecclesiastical areas and he was responsible for more than ninety churches in England prior to his migration to New South Wales. It was built from 1888-9. The main slate roof is an important part of the aesthetic quality of the building and together with the prominent tower has high visibility from the Great Western Highway. Sulman's original conception as seen from his drawings, was never completed. This included a western and eastern transept at the rear of the church and a massive crowning tower between the two. In 1961 the church added the eastern transept, according to the original plans. This was erected in stone with considerable sensitivity. The growth of the church and its adjacent complex over a century has been significant evidence of the social role Christchurch has continued to play in the local Anglican community.Christo Aitken, grant application letter, 11/2010 Additions and alterations to the place were made in the 1980s.  Description  The building is a fine sandstone church with a simple but sensitively designed interior. It forms part of a group of buildings which includes a separate dwelling, \\"Southall\\" to the west of the property and a fine stand of trees between the two. The roof is slate and the sandstone is local. It is a fine example of a Victorian Academic Gothic style church with high quality sandstone detailing and a prominent slate pitched roof to the main body of the church and the tower. = Condition = As at 5 January 2011, sections of the slate roof require careful removal and rehanging, as the nails holding the slates have corroded and need replacement. The tower roof, valleys, ridges and loose slates are the most urgent. A recent insurance inspection report gave the church an excellent report (2011 grant application). = Modifications and dates = *1961 added the eastern transept, according to the original plans *1980s additions and alterations. *2010 $9,000 currently being spent on replacing wiring in the church. A few damaged roof tiles were repaired (supporting nails have corroded/need replacement (grant application)  Heritage listing  As at 15 December 2005, Christ Church Springwood is a fine example of a Victorian Academic Gothic style church featuring high quality sandstone detailing. Extensions to the church to create the chancel, north transept and tower are in keeping with Sulman's original design. The interior of the church has an unusually peaceful atmosphere created by the use of pale sandstone and stained timber and restrained detailing. The church is a significant landmark on the Great Western Highway. The Christ Church has high local significance as the principal centre for Anglicanism in the lower Blue Mountains for over 110 years. The growth of the church and its adjacent complex over a century has been significant evidence of the social role Christ Church has continued to play for the local Anglican community. The major pieces of church furniture are highly significant memorials to the leading players in the creation of the building in the Victorian period. The Christ Church Springwood is built to the design of John Sulman, a significant architect of the late 19th and early 20th century. Sulman was also a renowned educator and was responsible for the Sulman Medal, the highest award for architectural design in NSW.LEP 1993 The Christ Church Anglican Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Born in Germany Gustav Dentzel was born in Kreuznach, Germany, on August 3, 1846. As a child, Gustav, would travel around southwest Germany during the summer from fair to fair with his father, Michael, and the rest of his family, setting up a small, portable carousel ride. Gustav learned the art of woodworking, carving carousel animals and making wagons during the off-season, from his father. Career Michael sent Gustav, and his brothers, to the United States, in 1864, along with a carousel, which may have been the first carousel to come to the New World. Gustav first opened a cabinet making shop and hired many German and Italian immigrants, like himself, that had learned woodcarving in the \\"Old Country\\". After building a small carousel and touring the countryside with it he found that people were eager to ride it. Gustav founded the Dentzel Carousel Company (also spelled Dentzel Carrousel Company, among other variations) in 1867, in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Dentzel has been credited for introducing the first steam-powered carousel and introducing the use of menagerie animals, such as cats, lions, tigers, deer, in addition to horses and chariots. Marriage Gustav married his first wife, Alma, in 1874. Together they had five children, Augusta, William H. I., Margaret, Helen, and Charles. However, Alma died in 1880, and Gustav remarried Mary. They had a son, Edward P. Death Gustav died in 1909, his sons William and Edward, took over the company and ran it until 1928, when William died.

The test is carried out with equipment consisting of a rod with vanes mounted to it that is inserted into the ground and rotated. A gauge on the top of the rod measures the torque required to cause failure of the soil and provides a conversion to shear strength. The equipment has been in use since at least 1948. The equipment has also been used since at least 1967 to assess the shear strength of packs of snow at risk of forming a slab avalanche.  Equipment used  The shear vane consists of a straight rod with four vanes on one end, arranged in a cruciform pattern, and a combined handle/torque gauge. The rod is inserted into the soil to a depth of 500mm and rotated at a rate of between 6 and 12 degrees per minute. Once the soil fails in shear the gauge shows the maximum torque applied. The gauge is marked with a scale that converts the torque into a shear strength (measured in kiloNewtons per square metre). There are two scales for use with two different sizes of vane ‚Äì vanes are used for soils with shear strengths up to 50 kN/m2 and vanes for stronger soils. In the United Kingdom the methodology is governed by British Standard 1377 (Methods of test for soils for civil engineering purposes). The shear vane is a simple and portable piece of equipment. The test is suitable for clay soils classified as soft to firm. By remoulding the sample and retesting an indication of the sensitivity of the clay can also be found. The test has also been used to measure the shear strength of mortar mixes, where it has been shown to correlate with the slump value. The equipment has also been used since at least 1967 to assess the shear strength of packs of snow at risk of forming a slab avalanche.  History and research  The test was pioneered by L Carlson and AW Skempton in 1948. There has been some dispute over its accuracy since then. Carlson and Skempton believed that it provided a higher value than that indicated by unconfined compressive tests and in fact agreed better with the values expected in geotechnical theory. However 1973 research claimed that the test actually provided an under-estimate of shear strength compared to compressive tests where a good quality of sample is obtainable. The discrepancy has been attributed to the disturbance of the sample caused by the insertion of the shear vane.

In the middle of 2012, Super Girlies released their third single, Missing You, a remake version of the original soundtrack of Indonesian teen soap opera Cinta Cenat-Cenut 2. Later that year, the group released their fourth single, Hip Hip Hura. The single was originally released by famous Indonesian singer Chrisye in 1985, while the cover version by the group is remade with new J-pop arrangement and feel.

This article will outline some current ideas relating to the first group - personal values. It will begin by looking at the kinds of thing that have value and finish with a look at some of the theories that attempt to describe what value is.Zimmerman M.J. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Value, 2002 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2018) Reference will be made solely to Western sources although it is recognised that many, if not all, of the values discussed may be universal. Introduction It is only in the last hundred years or so that the subject of value has become a subject of study in its own right, though the subject builds on the work of such earlier thinkers as Plato, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham. A new field of enquiry called ‚Äúaxiology‚Äù (from the Greek axios meaning ‚Äúworth‚Äù), defined as ‚Äúthe philosophical study of goodness or value‚Äù, began to emerge at around the beginning of the twentieth century, and its significance lay in extending the scope of the term ‚Äúvalue‚Äù into fields other than traditional ethics.Ex.Brit. s.v. Axiology R.H.Lotze, F.Brentano and G.E.Moore have been cited as early proponents of the subject, and to Moore is attributed the important distinction made between intrinsic and instrumental value, that is, between things that have value in themselves and things that might lead to something of value.Ibid; cf. Schroeder Op.cit.5 Examples of recent articles which introduce the subject include Mark Schroeder's Value Theory,Schroeder M. Value Theory, 2008 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2018) Elinor Mason's Value PluralismMason Op.cit.1 and Michael Zimmerman's Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value.Zimmerman Op.cit.2 Schroeder defines axiology as being ‚Äúprimarily concerned with classifying what things are good‚Äù, and, in accepting that there might be a number of things that can be valued or called good, he asks is there, underlying these, just one or is there more than one fundamental intrinsic value. Mason outlines two ways in which values have been considered in relation to one another: the first is called ‚Äúmonist‚Äù, which maintains that there is just one intrinsic value to which all other values are auxiliary; and the second is called ‚Äúpluralist‚Äù, which maintains that there are many kinds of value and that the most important of these are irreducible to one another. Typical of the first school were the Utilitarians, such as Jeremy Bentham, who thought that all the values that a person might hold could be reduced to a desire for happiness or pleasure. Immanuel Kant, too, has been described as a monist in saying that the only good in itself lies in possessing a good will.Ibid; cf. Kant.I Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals, 1785, p.12 Regarding those holding pluralist views, Zimmerman in his book The Nature of Intrinsic Value (2012) gives some examples of more recent philosophers with lists of the kinds of thing that they thought had value:Zimmerman M.J. The Nature of Intrinsic Value (Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham, 2001) p.189 Brentano (1889): Pleasure, Happiness, Love, Knowledge, Beauty, Proportion, Intention, Exercise, VirtueBrentano F. The Origin of our Knowledge of Right and Wrong, 1889 (Routledge and Keegan Paul, London, 1969) Moore (1908) - Aesthetics, Affection, Knowledge, Consciousness, Pleasure, VirtueMoore G.E. Principia Ethica (Cambridge University Press, 1903) pp.122 & passim Ross (1936) - Virtue, Pleasure, Knowledge, Artistic activityRoss W.D. The Right and the Good (Oxford University Press, 1930) In particular, Zimmerman singles out the work of William Frankena who, in his book Ethics (1963), gave a comprehensive list of values and who, besides suggesting the use of headings, began to group similar values together.Frankena W.K. Ethics, 1963 (Prentice-Hall, Eaglewood Cliffs, 1973) pp.87-88; cf. Zimmerman Op.cit.2 It will be useful to discuss these in the following groups: 1\\\\. Beauty, harmony, proportion, aesthetic experience 2\\\\. Moral disposition, virtue, pleasure, happiness, contentment 3\\\\. Truth, knowledge, understanding, wisdom, honour, esteem 4\\\\. Life, health, strength, peace, security 5\\\\. Love, affection, friendship, cooperation 6\\\\. Power, achievement, freedom, adventure, novelty Frankena, in formulating his list, builds on what he called the ‚Äúclassical triad‚Äù of beauty, goodness and truthIbid; cf. O‚ÄôHear A. Philosophy: The Good, the True and the Beautiful (Cambridge University Press, 2010) cf. Perry Op.cit.49, pp.93-97, 693 and headings similar to these terms can be used to introduce a primary set of values as follows. Primary values =Aesthetic values= An exquisitely beautiful Faberg√© egg Frankena in his list of values groups beauty with harmony, proportion and aesthetic experience. There are many different kinds of value that can be included in this category and Frankena himself distinguishes between ‚Äúharmony and proportion in objects contemplated‚Äù and ‚Äúharmony and proportion in one‚Äôs own life‚Äù.Frankena Op.cit.13, p.88 He refers to Plato who, firstly, in the Philebus suggests that aesthetic pleasure lies in the ‚Äúbeauty of colour and form‚Äù, and secondly in the Republic that formal features like harmony and proportion are important not only to art and music but also to the ‚Äúgood life‚Äù which itself should contain ‚Äúform‚Äù, ‚Äúvariety‚Äù and ‚Äúbalance‚Äù.Frankena Op.cit.13, p.92; cf. Plato The Republic (ed. Ferrari G., tr. Griffith T., Cambridge University Press, 2000) pp.88-92; cf Plato Philebus 51 Another distinction results from the question of whether aesthetic value resides in the object contemplated or in the contemplative experience itself.Beardsley M.C. Aesthetics from Classical Greece to the Present, 1966 (University of Alabama Press, 1975) pp.101-102 & passim James Shelley in his article The Concept of the Aesthetic notes that the term \\"aesthetic\\" in deriving from the Greek aesthesis, which means perception or awareness, tends towards the latter interpretation;Shelley J. The Concept of the Aesthetic, 2009 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2017) George Dickie in his book Art and the Aesthetic charts the development of awareness and consciousness in their growing importance to aesthetic theory;Dickie G. Art and the Aesthetic: An Intuitional Analysis (Cornell University Press, 1975) and Zimmerman refers to G.E.Moore who wrote in relation to art and beauty that ‚Äúby far the most valuable thing we know or can imagine are certain states of consciousness‚Äù.Zimmerman Op.cit.2; cf. MooreOp.cit.11, p.122 Both Frankena and Nicolai Hartmann, who Frankena mentions, begin their lists of values with groups including consciousness, life and existence, and Hartmann makes reference to Nietzsche who considered that the value of beauty in art or nature lay in an increased awareness of life as an ‚Äúaffirmation of existence‚Äù.Hartmann N. Ethics: Part II, The Realm of Ethical Values or Axiology of Morals, 1926 (George Allen and Unwin, London, 1951) Chapters 11 and 12; cf. Nietzsche F. The Birth of Tragedy pp.263,290 Shelley describes another concept apart from ‚Äúimmediacy‚Äù or ‚Äúfocussing one‚Äôs attention on the subject‚Äù and this is the concept of ‚Äúdisinterestedness\\", a Kantian term which consists in looking at things objectively and impartially.Kant I. The Critique of Judgement (tr. Meredith J.C. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1952) He refers to Schopenhauer who realised that if perception were to be the only criterion of aesthetic value then, with a mind stripped of practical interest and cultural preconceptions, anything at all might be seen as beautiful: ‚ÄúOne thing is only taken as more beautiful than another because it makes this pure contemplation easier‚Äù, wrote Schopenhauer,Schopenhauer A. The World as Will and Representation (tr. Payne E. Dover Publications, New York, 1966) pp.271-272 a view criticised by Sartwell for making the term beauty, ultimately meaningless.Sartwell C. Beauty, 2012 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2017) Shelley, however, manages to elucidate various criteria of aesthetic value from such a standpoint: firstly, that there is value in simple formal relations, in harmony, grace and balance, and in fact in any other objective aspect that a good critic might care to point to; secondly, that there is value in recognising that people have natural tastes and preferences, whether, for example, they prefer ‚Äúdrama or comicality‚Äù, or whether the work is striking in some way; and thirdly, that there is value in recognising the presence of ‚Äúnon-exhibited properties‚Äù, realising that the work, or perception, is located within an ‚Äúart-historical context‚Äù where only knowledge of, in Danto's terminology, an ‚Äúartworld‚Äù can facilitate our feeling ‚Äúthe proper sentiments‚Äù.Shelley Op.cit.18; cf. Dickie Op.cit.19 In addition to the views that aesthetic value lies either in the object or in the subjective experience there is a third view which suggests that value lies in some kind of engagement between the two. G.E.Moore wrote that it is neither in the ‚Äúbeautiful object‚Äù nor in the ‚Äúconscious perception‚Äù where value is found but in the relationship between the two.Moore Op.cit.11 pp.18,59,122 Shelley too concludes with the idea that there is some reciprocal relationship between subject and object, his example being that of a Bartok quartet, where ‚Äúa value originally belonging to the quartet has been transferred to the experience, before being reflected back, once again, onto the quartet.‚ÄùShelley Op.cit.18 =Ethical values= Happiness by French sculptor Jef Lambeaux The second group of values listed by Frankena includes happiness, virtue, pleasure, satisfaction and contentment - values traditionally associated with the field of ethics.Frankena Op.cit.13 Zimmerman introduces Plato whose recurring concern was with the nature of the good, how we should live our lives, and whether it is pleasure or virtue that will lead to happiness.Zimmerman Op.cit.9, p.114; cf. Plato Op.cit.16, pp.37,51 Regarding pleasure, he considers food, drink and shelter to be simple goods ‚Äì people value them, they value the work that goes into providing them and the pleasure that comes from enjoying them. Zimmerman after asking why eating should be considered a value refers to Aristotle who said that value resides in ‚Äúthe proper activity or functioning of things according to their nature‚Äù and that it is the ‚Äúactive exercising of man‚Äôs faculties that give rise to pleasure‚Äù.Zimmerman Op.cit.2; cf. Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics (tr. Thomson J., Penguin, Harmondsworth, 2004) Regarding virtue, Elinor Mason refers to J.S.Mill who made the distinction between lower values and higher values.Mason Op.cit.1 The distinction is that between efficient cause and final cause: whereas efficient cause includes hunger, thirst and the need for shelter, final cause arises from our having an overview of the relation of cause and effect whereby we can determine the end we want to achieve and then decide the means to achieve it.Frankena Op.cit.13, p.86; cf. Aristotle Metaphysics 982b-983a If the end is well-being or happiness then such values as friendship, knowledge and beauty, as well as material sustenance, might be instrumental in achieving this.Mason Op.cit.1 Mason refers to G.E.Moore who, whilst recognising the virtues of ‚Äúindustry and temperance‚Äù, recognised that there exists a ‚Äúplurality of bearers of value‚Äù. Love, beauty and friendship are intrinsic values (i.e. good in themselves) rather than instrumental values, and they do not lead in all cases necessarily either to pleasure or happiness.Moore Op.cit.11 Another significant writer on value, mentioned by both Frankena and Zimmerman, is John Dewey who questioned whether intrinsic values exist at all. All values for Dewey were instrumental. He compared life to an ‚Äúongoing stream‚Äù of cause and effect, which he called the ‚Äúcontinuum of means and ends‚Äù,Dewey J. Theory of Valuation, 1923, in International Encyclopaedia of Unified Sciences Vol II (University of Chicago Press, 1939) p.43; cf. Anderson Op.cit.140 where for example a lack of food leads to human activity leading to a further expenditure of energy, the need for more food and so on. He maintained, like Aristotle, that value lay in economy and in the efficient functioning of a human being in terms of a whole range of needs and wants.Ibid. pp.15-18, 50 These needs arise from a constant ‚Äúinteraction between a human being and his environment‚Äù and Dewey introduced the notion of having a ‚Äúframework‚Äù of values to deal effectively with the various categories of being which contribute to our environment.Ibid. p.47 =Cultural values= The Owl of Athena, connoting wisdom The third of the classical values - truth ‚Äì is listed by Frankena alongside knowledge, understanding and wisdom.Frankena Op.cit.13, p.88 Given that ‚Äútruth may never be fully known‚Äù he shifted the emphasis onto knowledge, and most lists of values now tend to include knowledge rather than truth as one of the primary values. Jesse Prinz in Culture and Cognitive Science took this further discussing the relativity of the terms knowledge and truth and the role that culture has in shaping knowledge.Prinz J. Culture and Cognitive Science, 2011 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2016) This relativity is more pronounced in a second group listed by Frankena, a group which included the values of honour, esteem and good reputation. The link between the two groups was noted by Hartmann who realised that the terms ‚Äútruth‚Äù and ‚Äútruthfulness‚Äù involved two different, although related, kinds of value.Hartmann Op.cit.17, Sec.6 Whilst truth is associated with the values of knowledge and understanding, truthfulness is associated with the values of honesty, uprightness and integrity. In his article, Prinz defines culture as a complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morality and custom where the value associated with these things is acquired by people as members of society. This acquisition takes place through observing role models, imitating one's parents or learning through association with others. The telling of stories is mentionedPrinz Op.cit.39 and we may think of the value of books, whether fiction or non-fiction, and the worth of films or news programmes in disseminating knowledge and furthering understanding generally. Memory too has its place,Ibid; cf. Ruskin J. The Seven Lamps of Architecture (George Allen, London, 1880) pp.177ff and the importance of history in this respect is highlighted by Zimmerman who notes that some things may have value, not because they are beautiful or useful, but because they have meaning through either personal or cultural associations, for example a rare stamp or the pen with which Lincoln signed his letters.Zimmerman Op.cit.2 Knowledge of both culture and subculture is important in understanding people's values.Dewey Op.cit.35, pp.58-64 Jacobson in an article on fitting attitudes tells us that what people find funny or shameful, honourable or dishonourable are culturally related, and he refers back to Brentano who introduced the related value of what is appropriate, suitable or fitting.Jacobson D. Fitting Attitude Theories of Value, 2011 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2011) Such values, however, can be considered not only from the point of view of a particular culture but from ‚Äúthe point of view of the universe‚Äù where integrating one's set of values with the principles of some higher truth (‚Äúselective copying‚Äù is the example he gives) may result in instances of non- conformity and other kinds of differentiation within society.Ibid. The concept of ‚Äúfittingness‚Äù introduces the value of integrity which Cox, La Caze and Levine discuss in their article Integrity [2001].Cox D., La Caze M. & Levine M. Integrity, 2001 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2017) The concept is defined in terms of the relation between the different aspects of one's life ‚Äì aesthetic, social, intellectual etc. ‚Äì and in maintaining some sort of balance between them to give a sense of unity or wholeness. Views on integrity range from the practical requirements of honesty and truthfulness on the one hand, where Aristotle could write ‚Äúwith a true view all the data harmonise and with a false view the facts soon clash‚Äù,Aristotle Op.cit.30, 1098b to more general approaches regarding meaning and identity, or ‚Äúwisdom and self-knowledge‚Äù.Cox, La Caze & Levine Op.cit.47 Secondary values The end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries saw an expansion in the number of values over and above the ‚Äúclassical‚Äù or primary values of beauty, goodness and truth. Some, like love, friendship and affection, clearly come from the Christian tradition and were discussed by philosophers like Moore and Brentano.Frankena Op.cit. 13, pp.56-59; cf. Moore Op.cit.11 pp.131-132 A more complex group revolving around concepts such as power, spirit and the will were introduced as values by Brentano and Hartmann and owe as much to the thoughts of Kant and Schopenhauer as they do to Christianity.Chisholm R. Brentano and Intrinsic Value (Cambridge University Press, 1986) The emergence of a third group of values can be seen as a result of the expansion of the field away from traditional ethics, and in this group there begin to appear more material values ‚Äì what Plato called the ‚Äúgoods of the body‚Äù ‚Äì such as life, health and strength in the lists of Hartmann and Frankena.Hartmann Op.cit.17; cf. Plato Op.cit.16 591b; cf Plato Meno 90ff Some early attempts were made at compiling a longer set of values and three of these can be mentioned here. R.B.Perry, referred to by Frankena, and whose work The General Theory of Value [1926] was called ‚Äúthe magnum opus of the new approach‚Äù by the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, increased the total number of categories by adding to the fields of aesthetics, ethics and knowledge the three further fields of religion, economics and politics;Perry R.B. General Theory of Value (Harvard University Press; 1926) pp.693-694 An earlier work, Lebensformen [1914], by the psychologist, Eduard Spranger, set out a similar list describing six types of personality, namely the Aesthetic, Economic, Theoretic, Religious, Social and Political;Spranger E. Types of Men, 1914 (tr. Pigors P., Max Niemeyer Verlag, Halle, 1928) and Gordon Allport, who studied under Spranger, and who was mentioned in Peterson and Seligman's Character Strengths and Virtues [2004]Miller C.B. Empirical Approaches to Moral Character, 2016 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2016); cf. Peterson C. & Seligman M. Character Strengths and Virtues (Oxford University Press, New York, 2004) , together with Vernon and Lindzey, set out in their Study of Values [1950] six types of personality each of which was orientated towards a different set of values:Allport G., Vernon P.E. & Lindzey G.E. Study of Values (Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1960) Personality *Aesthetic *Economic *Theoretic *Religious *Social *Political Values *Harmony, Beauty, Artistry, Uniqueness *Usefulness, Resourcefulness, Practical *Truth, Intellectual, Cognitive *Faith, Unity, Holiness, Oneness *Love, Sympathy, Caring, Altruism *Power, Leadership, Influence, Competitiveness These early links between philosophy and psychology have been discussed by C.B. Miller in his article entitled Empirical Approaches to Moral Character and this concluded with a look at the work of Peterson and Seligman.Miller Op.cit.55 Their classification of values, \\"Values in Action\\" or VIA, arose from an empirical survey of virtues taken from around the world, which led to a six- fold classification, similar to the above, and comprising: Transcendence, Temperance, Wisdom, Justice, Humanity and Courage.Peterson and Seligman Op.cit 55 Miller suggested, however, that no valid reason has been discovered as to why there should be six categories. Altruism Regarding the content of these additional categories it is clear that their representative values differ according to who is compiling the list. One theory suggests that if the first three categories represent the cognitive or classical tradition, then the additional categories represent the non-cognitive - the ‚Äúsentimental‚Äù or ‚Äúemotivist‚Äù tradition - where neither the cognitive nor the non-cognitive necessarily takes primacy.Zimmerman Op.cit. 2; Jacobson Op.cit. 45 Zimmerman suggested that values taken from the latter viewpoint could be seen as just expressions of feeling or emotion about what is important.Ibid. A.M.Taylor in her paper, Investigation into Facts and Values [1983], suggested that there was a fundamental difference between values based on analytical understanding and values based on synthetic or ‚Äúholistic‚Äù understanding.Taylor A-M (n√©e Cushan) Investigation into Facts and Values, 1983 (Ondwell Publications, Victoria, Australia, 2014) pp.9, 14-16 The older values taken from the ‚Äúaesthetic, moral and scientific spheres‚Äù were not enough and new categories would be required to include such concepts as ‚Äúcreativity, feeling and innovation‚Äù. Jacobson also introduced a distinction between cognitive and non- cognitive values, and among the values derived from feeling or sentiment he included those of being ‚Äúpride-worthy, shameful, funny and fearsome‚Äù.Jacobson Op.cit.45 He mentioned David Hume in this respect who had used the three headings of ‚ÄúPride and Humility‚Äù, ‚ÄúLove and Hatred‚Äù and ‚ÄúWill and the Direct Passions‚Äù in the second volume of his Treatise of Human NatureHume D. A Treatise of Human Nature (ed. Selby-Bigge L.A., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1988) and it will be useful to look at the second group of values in this order. =Material values= Frankena's list of values begins with a group that contains life, health and strength and in this he closely follows Hartmann.Frankena Op.cit.13, p.88 ‚ÄúMaterial goods‚Äù were discussed by Hartmann in the introductory section of his book,The Realm of Ethical Values [1926] in relation to wealth and economics.Hartmann Op.cit.21 Frankena mentions Plato who had referred to wealth, health and strength as ‚Äúgoods of the body‚Äù.Plato Op.cit.16 Regarding wealth, Frankena, in a discussion of ‚Äúmoney, cars and other material possessions‚Äù, suggested that its value might be either instrumental or contributory, the latter term being defined in terms of ‚Äúthings that are good because they contribute to a good life or are parts of it‚Äù.Frankena Op.cit.13, pp.62,81 Money for a miser becomes part of his happiness, just as clothes, house or land may be a part of happiness for somebody else. Jacobson introduced the value of being ‚Äúpride-worthy‚Äù and he mentioned David Hume who had noted that people take pride in, such ‚Äúexternal advantages as‚Ä¶ country, family, children, gardens, houses, dogs and clothes‚Äù.Hume Op.cit.63, p.545 Elinor Mason mentioned the practical wisdom of Aristotle who saw wealth as a matter of prudence, and who advised people to value and ‚Äúnot to neglect‚Äù what belongs to them.Aristotle Op.cit.30, 1120b Health on the other hand, in relation to the body and the mind, is usually thought of as an intrinsic value. Frankena, for example, wrote that we desire health ‚Äúfor its own sake‚Äù,Frankena Op.cit.13, pp.82,87 and Zimmerman wrote that ‚ÄúBeing healthy is just a good way to be‚Äù.Zimmerman Op.cit.2 The value that we ascribe to life itself and the value of ‚Äújust being‚Äù have been mentioned previously, but it was Hartmann who reintroduced the notion from earlier German philosophy that Being has a complementary category, namely that of Becoming.Hartmann Op.cit.21; cf. Schopenhauer Op.cit.23 Everything is subject to change over time, and without human intervention, is subject to deterioration and decay. In relation to this, Mason referred to Immanuel Kant one of whose principal values lay in duty, particularly, in this respect, duty to self, and looking after the ‚Äúbasic stuff‚Äù through physical exercise and maintenance.Kant I The Metaphysics of Morals, 1797 (tr. Gregor M., Cambridge University Press, 1996) Plato had also thought that the right way of living lay in ‚Äúmedicine, bathing and exercise‚ÄùPlato Op.cit.16 but Kant added to this idea by saying that value also lay in self-improvement through the cultivation of any ‚Äúnatural talents and gifts of fortune‚Äù that a person might possess.Kant Op.cit.73 James Griffin in his book on Well-Being [1986] similarly introduced the value of ‚Äúaccomplishment‚Äù and how, in Aristotle's terminology, we might grow and ‚Äúflourish‚Äù in other ways.Griffin J. Well-Being: Its Meaning, Measurement and Moral Importance (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986) pp.35,57 =Communal values= Love by Lorenzo Quinn To the classical triad of beauty, goodness and truth various philosophers in the twentieth century began to add values from another large family: that of, in Frankena's words, ‚Äúlove, friendship, mutual affection and cooperation‚Äù;Frankena Op.cit.13, pp.42,88 G.E.Moore added ‚Äúlove‚Äù to the values of beauty, moral quality and knowledge;Moore Op.cit.11, pp.122-123; cf. Zimmerman Op.cit.9, p.189 and Jacobson added ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù to the values of beauty, pleasure and knowledge.Jacobson Op.cit.45 ‚ÄúConsider a plausible list of intrinsic values: pleasure, beauty, friendship, knowledge‚Ä¶‚Äù Moore, in reflecting Christianity's emphasis on the importance of love, suggested that ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the love of love is by far the most valuable good we know‚Ä¶ more complicated than beauty‚Ä¶ more complicated than knowledge‚Äù.Moore Op.cit.11, p.132 Both Frankena and Zimmerman mentioned Plato, who had outlined various kinds of love in the Symposium,Plato Symposium 197 and who had described sympatheia or coaffection, as ‚Äúfilling men with affection‚Ä¶ kindness‚Ä¶ friendship‚Ä¶ forgiveness‚Äù.Plato Op.cit.16, 605d For Plato, the soul was the seat of love and the affections, and its value lay in recognising the ‚Äúcommunity of feeling among mankind‚Äù.Plato Timaeus 192b; Plato Gorgias 481 Jacobson referred to David Hume who similarly linked love with sympathy, the latter feeling arising from ‚Äúthe great resemblance among human creatures‚Äù.Hume Op.cit.63, p.112 On a more practical level, Bernard Gert in his work on The Definition of Morality [2002] introduced the notion of ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù as a factor in establishing a sense of community among family and kinship groups.Gert B. & Gert J. The Definition of Morality, 2002 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2016) Regarding wider society, Gert mentioned Kant who distinguished between the values of not harming other people on the one hand and performing positive, charitable acts on the other.Ibid. Zimmerman also mentioned Kant and his view that the only thing that is good without qualification is goodwill or benevolence.Zimmerman Op.cit.2 Kant had defined friendship as ‚Äúthe coming together of two persons through mutual love, each particating and sharing their lives in a sympathetic manner‚Äù.Kant Op.cit.73, 6.450, 6.469 He also introduced the concept of ‚Äúrespect‚Äù by which he meant keeping an appropriate distance from others within the community,Ibid. 6.449 and he talked of community itself in terms of ‚Äúbeing able to communicate‚Ä¶ to perfect social intercourse‚Ä¶ and to cultivate a disposition of‚Ä¶ reciprocity‚Ä¶ agreeableness‚Ä¶ courtesy‚Ä¶ hospitality‚Äù.Ibid.6.473 Communication was introduced as a separate value by Perry;Perry Op.cit.53, pp.13-14 and Hartmann, after working through the primary values, introduced a ‚Äúsecond group‚Äù which included not only ‚Äúbrotherly love‚Äù but also ‚Äúsocial intercourse‚Äù.Hartmann Op.cit.21 Frankena introduced Aquinas who had stressed the value of communication in human relationships saying that ‚Äúthere are close parallels between the communication of words and that between lover and beloved‚Äù.Gilby T. St Thomas Aquinas: Theological Texts (Oxford University Press) pp.181ff Gert too realised that there was value in ‚Äúinterpersonal interaction‚Äù but queried how such a value could apply in the absence of other people, for example, on a desert island.Gert & Gert Op.cit.85 Frankena answered the question by widening the scope of love to include love of, or communion with, God, animals, nature and the environment.Frankena Op.cit.13 p.88 =Spiritual values= Love of the wilderness Towards the end of his list, Frankena included the values of power and achievement, freedom, adventure and novelty.Ibid. Regarding freedom, he introduced Schopenhauer who saw life as a continuous engagement with the realm of strife, a struggle against desire and the ‚Äúprimal will‚Äù, where the only moments of freedom that a person may have lay in art, music and spiritual contemplation.Beardsley Op.cit.17, p.459; cf. Carrit E.F. The Theory of Beauty (Methuen & Co, London, 1914) p.122 Strength and freedom of the will were values for Hartmann too,Hartmann Op.cit.21, Sec.3 and also for Kant who, as Zimmerman noted, saw such freedom lying in the absence of coercion either from external agencies of from internal ‚Äúsensuous impulses‚Äù.Zimmerman Op.cit.2; cf.Kant I. Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals, 1785, p.12 These latter included emotions such as desire, fear, hope and anger, whose value, or power, lay, according to Aristotle, in moving a person either towards or away from some perceived object.Aristotle De Anima 408b; Similar feelings inform our attitudes, according to Brentano, which he termed either pro-attitudes or anti-attitudes accordingly, see Chisholm Op.cit.51, p.22 Griffin distinguished between desire itself and ‚Äúinformed desire‚Äù, where the value of the latter lay in stirring the mind, not involuntarily through emotion and natural inclination, but through the voluntary power of the will.Griffin Op.cit.76; pp.26-27 Attitudes can be controlled through strength of mind, courage and self-discipline, and ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù, according to Brentano, through an informed choice about what is right, fitting or appropriate.Jacobson Op.cit.45 Frankena recorded that his list included ‚Äúall the things that Hartmann mentions‚Äù,Frankena Op.cit.13, p.88 but it is notable that Hartmann completed his list with what he called ‚Äúspiritual goods‚Äù such as ‚Äúlove of the remote‚Äù and, in a Nietzschian phrase, ‚Äúradiant virtue‚Äù.Hartmann Op.cit.21, Sec.7 Love of the remote referred to either love of the wilderness or love of God, but Michael Stocker in Plural and Conflicting Values [1990]Stocker M. Plural and Conflicting Values (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1990) suggested that value lay more, as Plato had said, not in love but in the ‚Äúcontemplation‚Äù of God or of what is good: ‚ÄúHe who proceeds aright‚Äù, said Plato, ‚Äúshould begin in youth to visit beautiful places‚Ä¶ to contemplate the vast sea‚Ä¶ until on that shore he grows and waxes strong‚Äù.Plato Symposium 210 In the Jewish tradition it was not so much the sea that bestowed strength, but the hills,Psalms 121.1 and Griffin referred to those who value mountains for the excitement or the sublimity that they might afford.Griffin Op.cit.76, p.27 Frankena referred to the values of adventure and novelty that A.N.Whitehead had introduced,Frankena Op.cit.13, p.92 but it was Ralph Waldo Emerson in the previous century who had written about the inspirational value of new things and of travel, not only for the sake of art or study, but for the value of the experience itself.Emerson R.W. Experience in Nature and Selected Essays (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1982) Hartmann suggested that it might be a great work of art such as a cathedral or a piece of music that might be inspiring,Hartmann Op.cit.21, p.57 and he mentioned Nietzsche who wrote regarding art: ‚ÄúWhat does all art do? Does it not select? Does it not highlight? By doing these art strengthens certain values‚Ä¶ It is the great stimulus of life‚Äù.Nietzsche F. Twilight of the Idols (tr. Hollingdale R., Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1968) pp.81-82 Alternatively it might be humour that lifts the spirits and Jacobson discusses the value that different kinds of humour, such as being funny or being amusing might merit.Jacobson Op.cit.45 Theories of value Various theories have been put forward in the West to try and define what a value ‚Äúis‚Äù ‚Äì as opposed to saying what kinds of value a thing may ‚Äúhave‚Äù.Zimmerman Op.cit.2 There are generally held to be three kinds of theory at present that attempt to answer the question of what a value is and these have been borrowed from the field of ethics.Mason Op.cit.1; cf. Frankena Op.cit.13, pp.14,62; cf. Schroeder Op.cit.5 Each group of theories tends to concentrate on different aspects of the subject so that if ethics can be defined as, say, the principles governing the conduct of a personFrankena Op.cit.13, p.6; cf. Gert & Gert Op.cit.85 then the first group of theories (ontology and deontology) looks at the principles themselves, the second group of theories (teleology and consequentialism) looks at the aims and outcomes of conduct, and the third group of theories (virtue ethics and fitting-attitude theory) looks at the concept of the person, their character and attitudes. =Ontology and deontology= Ontology (from the Greek Ontos meaning ‚Äúbeing‚Äù or ‚Äúthat which is‚Äù)Liddell and Scott A Greek-English Lexicon, 1940, pr.p. of ennai ‚Äúto be‚Äù is that branch of metaphysics which deals with being, and, particularly in relation to value theory, with the ‚Äúontological categories‚Äù or plain categories of being.Zimmerman Op.cit.9, p.52; cf. Moore Op.cit.11, pp.77ff Zimmerman mentions G.E.Moore who pointed out that before discussing what we ought to value we should consider the possibility that anything that exists might be of value to somebody: ‚ÄúIf we recognise that anything whatever may be good‚Ä¶ we start with a much more open mind‚Äù.Moore Op.cit.11, pp.13,74; cf. Perry Op.cit.53, pp.115-116 Zimmerman introduced the concept of ‚Äúsupervenience‚Äù through which it is held that any structuring of our values will reflect the structuring of the underlying categories of being themselves.Zimmerman Op.cit.2; cf. Zimmerman Op.cit.9, p.115 Kant is mentioned by Zimmerman in this respect, and also Christine Korsgaard who, drawing on Kant's distinction between things-in-themselves and the relation between things, draws a similar distinction between intrinsic values (values in virtue of ‚Äúnon-relational properties‚Äù) and extrinsic values (values in virtue of ‚Äúrelational properties‚Äù).Ibid; cf. Korsgaard C. Two Distinctions in Goodness (in Philosophical Review, 92, 169-95, 1983) Regarding the former an impasse is reached when all that can be said of intrinsic values is, in Moore's words, that goodness ‚Äújust is‚Äù, or in Zimmerman's words that pleasure ‚Äújust is‚Äù.Zimmerman Op.cit.2; cf Moore Op.cit.11, pp.6ff This has led to some, like Monroe Beardsley, to say that only extrinsic values, in the final analysis, exist.Ibid. Different kinds of extrinsic value in this model derive from the different underlying categories of relation, the example given being those of beauty, utility and meaning, each of which is supervenient on one of Kant's three categories of relation, namely disjunction, causality and inherence respectively.Ibid; cf. Kant I. Critique of Pure Reason (tr. Smith N.K. Macmillan, London, 1968) pp.107,113 Deontology, on the other hand, (from the Greek Deon meaning ‚Äúduty‚Äù)Liddell & Scott Op.cit.118 is the branch of ethics that bases value on moral principles which in turn form a guide to knowing what \\"ought\\" to be done in various situations. The problem in philosophy of moving from an ‚Äúis‚Äù to an ‚Äúought‚Äù (the ‚ÄúIs-ought problem\\") is said to have been introduced into philosophy by David Hume. Richmond Campbell, in discussing this, asks how one might move from a knowledge of what exists, i.e. from a whole range of possible values, to a knowledge of which, among these, one ought to value.Campbell R. Moral Epistemology, 2003 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2015) Given that ‚Äúa small number of core moral values are espoused universally‚Äù the answer would appear to lie in giving priority to those which do not ‚Äúconflict‚Äù. Frankena suggested that these moral principles are derived from three main sources: the prevailing moral rules of a culture; divine revelation as found in the holy texts; and logical or metaphysical deduction.Frankena Op.cit.13, pp.12ff Kant's categorical imperative is given as an example of the latter, although Frankena pointed out that a distinction would need to be made between arguments of logical necessity, i.e. those which contain no contradictions, and arguments of logical sufficiency which would be needed to account for the various kinds of value, whether ‚Äúaesthetic, prudential or logical‚Äù.Ibid., pp.30-33 =Teleology and consequentialism= Mark Schroeder in his article on Value Theory considers consequentialism to be ‚Äúunder the umbrella‚Äù of teleology,Schroeder Op.cit.5 where the latter can be defined as that branch of metaphysics which deals with the final end or purpose of things (the Greek Telos meaning ‚Äúthe end or purpose of an action‚Äù).Liddell & Scott Op.cit.118 According to this group of theories things are instrumentally valuable which help to achieve either specific or general ends, and underlying this, Schroeder tells us, is the relation of cause and effect.Schroeder Op.cit.5 Frankena defined instrumental value as that which is good or useful for some purpose and he referred to Aristotle who, besides defining different kinds of cause, defined the good as ‚Äúthat at which all things aim‚Äù.Frankena Op.cit.13, p.86; cf. Aristotle Op.cit.30 If for example the aim is to live a good life those things will be good or valuable which constitute the means for achieving such an end. However, what is good for a specific person and what is good for the world as a whole are two different things and are reflected, according to Schroeder, in the ideas of egoism and consequentialism respectively.Schroeder Op.cit.5 Regarding the latter, Zimmerman writes that a value is good because of a perceived final end in which ‚Äúall the consequences taken as a whole are good‚Äù.Zimmerman Op.cit.2 Regarding the end at which people aim, Bentham, according to Elinor Mason, thought that the sole end was that of ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù, and that all other values such as beauty, friendship, knowledge etc. could be measured in accordance with the quantity of pleasure which each might afford.Mason Op.cit.1 John Stuart Mill suggested that there were lower and higher pleasures and that these were fundamentally incommensurable. He went on to question, like Plato, whether the values of pleasure or satisfaction were in fact the ends at which intelligent people should aim.Ibid; cf. Plato Op.cit.16, p.505b Mason also refers to James Griffin who was of the opinion that ‚Äúwell-being‚Äù was a better name for such an end, and which he saw in terms of ‚Äúflourishing‚Äù or a ‚Äúmaximisation of life‚Äù in all its aspects.Griffin Op.cit.76, pp.34,57 A ‚Äúbalancing of elements‚Äù is required whereby those activities which we value for well-being, such as work, rest, love, solitude, health, accomplishment etc. should be considered ‚Äúin various combinations‚Äù in order to afford a ‚Äúframework‚Äù or a ‚Äúplan of life‚Äù for ourselves.Ibid., p.58; cf. Dewey Op.cit.35, p.47 re ‚Äúframework‚Äù This way of thinking was called by Elizabeth Anderson, in her article on John Dewey, ‚Äúobjective list theory‚Äù as opposed to theories like Bentham's based on pleasure or those of Dewey based on ‚Äúinformed desire‚Äù.Anderson E. Dewey‚Äôs Moral Philosophy, 2005 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2014) Dewey rejected the notion of a final end arguing instead that the ‚Äúvalue of means and ends are reciprocally determined‚Äù.Dewey Op.cit.35, pp.24,40ff According to Zimmerman, he challenged traditional metaphysical ideas with a more ‚Äúpragmatic‚Äù approach saying that only through ‚Äúcalm, informed reflection‚Äù on the ways in which people ‚Äúinteract with the environment‚Äù and deal with the ensuing consequences can value be ascertained.Zimmerman Op.cit.2; cf. Dewey Op.cit.35, p.30 =Virtue ethics and fitting-attitude theory= Mason in her article on Value Pluralism introduces virtue ethics as a third way of thinking about the subject of value and describes it as being based on how a person should ‚Äúbe‚Äù rather than what a person should ‚Äúdo‚Äù.Mason Op.cit.1 Frankena had similarly introduced an ‚Äúethics of virtue‚Äù as a third approach (following deontology and consequentialism), suggesting that there were two kinds of things that we can value: either the things around us like knowledge or physical objects; or the things inside us like our disposition, attitudes and emotions.Frankena Op.cit.13, p.62 Among the latter were the virtues and these he defined as dispositions to act in certain ways.Ibid., pp.64,68 Regarding the virtues, we can either value them in their own right or we can ask whether they tell us something about the nature of value itself. Hursthouse and Pettigrew deal with the first of these options in their article on Virtue ethics, asking questions like ‚Äúhow many virtues are there‚Äù and ‚Äúhow do they relate to each other‚Äù.Hursthouse R. & Pettigrove G. Virtue Ethics, 2003 (ed. Zalta E.N. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2016) C.B.Miller, on the other hand, in his article on moral character points to recent work which suggests that the categories used to structure the virtues are the same as those that can be used to structure values. The six ‚Äúcore virtues‚Äù listed by Peterson and Seligman have been found to be useful, for example, in the structuring of values in their ‚ÄúValues in Action‚Äù or VAI.Miller Op.cit.55 One of the similarities between virtue theory and fitting-attitude theory is that they both approach the subject of value through an emphasis on the agent.Mason Op.cit.1; cf. Frankena Op.cit.13, p.64 They are ‚Äúagent-centred‚Äù rather than ‚Äúact-centred‚Äù theories, but whereas virtues are defined purely as a disposition to act, fitting-attitude theory embraces the act as well within its field of consideration. Roderick Chisholm in his book, Brentano and Intrinsic Value [1986] suggested that value lies, for example, not just in virtue but in ‚Äúindividuals acting virtuously‚Äù or not just in pleasure but in ‚Äúindividuals experiencing pleasure‚Äù.Chisholm Op.cit.51, p.17 However, just as there is conceived to be a necessary interaction between the agent and the environment so there is, in other circumstances, a necessary engagement between the agent and an object. Jacobson in his article on Fitting-Attitude Theory suggests that there is a reciprocity between ‚Äúfacts about human nature‚Äù and ‚Äúfacts about the object‚Äù,Jacobson Op.cit.45 and that ‚Äúto be valuable‚Äù requires either that one's ‚Äúfeelings are adequate to the object‚Äù, or that ‚Äúthe object is ‚Äúfitting‚Äù in respect of some particular attitude.Ibid. The concept of fittingness, or what might fit together, is extended to the relation between different values and, in particular, the possible conflicts between them, the examples given being between that of humour and good taste, or between what is considered funny and what is considered fair or just. Both MasonMason Op.cit.1 and ZimmermanZimmerman Op.cit. 2 discuss the problem of conflicting values, as did Philippa Foot who, in the field of virtue ethics, suggested that the answer to possible conflict lay in bringing the virtues, or values, into relation with one another saying ‚Äúthat even such concepts as love and justice can become dangerously distorted\\" if not tempered with a consideration of other fundamental values.Foot P.

Plot Voodoo queen Dinah Stevens is seen performing a ritual on a man who is guilty of having extramarital sex. Dinah gets paid by the cheated wife and surprises her with the woman's ripped-out heart which she puts in a blender, together with some other concoctions. After forcing the husband to swallow the potion, Dinah leaves and is confronted outside by Cordelia. The witch reveals she needs Dinah's help with summoning Papa Legba in order to stop Michael. On the set of a slasher movie, witch actress Bubbles McGee is visited by Madison. The ex-coven member is needed back within the circle in order to use her power of thought reading on Ariel Augustus and Baldwin Pennypacker. Meanwhile, Cordelia and Dinah summon Papa Legba who is accompanied by the soul of dead witch Nan. Cordelia tells Legba about preparing a trap for Michael: banishing him to Hell forever. Legba demands the souls of all the witches in return but the Supreme refuses and Legba disappears. At Miss Robichaux's, Coco discovers a new power, she can now guess the right calorie content of sweets like muffins. While eating a snowball, Coco begins to choke and dies, but Mallory opens Coco's neck and removes the snowball and saves her life. Zoe thinks it's rather Mallory than Michael who's responsible for Cordelia's supreme powers decreasing. Bubbles prepares a meal and dines with Ariel, Baldwin and Myrtle. Bubbles learns about the planned death of fellow warlock John Henry Moore and about the warlocks' urge to kill all the witches through her powers. The coven travels to the gas station where Moore was killed in order for Mallory to bring him back. Mallory brings the warlock back to life and therefore accomplishes her last task of The Seven Wonders. Coco is given the task of tracking down Mead, who killed Moore. When Coco confronts the satanist, Mead shoots the witch with a tranquilizer gun but two men appear and kidnap Mead.

Lynch has a great eye, and she's adept at the house style of American Horror Story, particularly the newsreel of John Henry's resurrection. She also has a great handle on the actors involved, and the choice to have Miriam face her fiery death with a gleeful grin was a brilliant one. She might not have magical powers or be the child of Satan, but there's something truly evil about her that gives her true power that the others cannot replicate.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an B. She criticized the scene with Papa Legba and Nan, commenting that it \\"serves mostly as fan service [...] and the plot of the series advances by, like, a millimeter.\\" She was also not a fan of the multiple plot conveniences, like during the dinner scene with the warlocks or how Coco somehow located Mead. However, she enjoyed Collins' new character, calling her \\"an aging glamazon\\" and \\"a useful asset for the coven‚Äôs next play\\". She also praised the development of Dinah' character, but also the characters of Mallory and Behold. Vultures Ziwe Fumudoh gave the episode a 4 out of 5.

She also appreciated the fact that the character of John Henry was not forgotten, and the developments of Mallory and Dinah. However, she criticized the character of Coco, saying that she is \\"like the Weight Watchers of witches, which isn't particularly interesting\\", and the dinner scene with the warlocks.

Written by Crystal Liu and directed by Sarah Paulson, it aired on October 17, 2018, on the cable network FX. The episode saw a return to the setting used for season one, Murder House, as well as the reappearance of original cast members Connie Britton, Dylan McDermott, and Jessica Lange. \\"Return to Murder House\\" received critical acclaim from reviewers, who praised Paulson's direction, Lange's return, and the performances and chemistry of Emma Roberts and Billy Porter. For her performance in the episode, Lange was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Plot Madison Montgomery and Behold Chablis purchase the Murder House in Los Angeles, which has been abandoned for several years. Arriving at the house, the two perform a spell which will allow them to see the ghosts, who can otherwise hide themselves from the living. In the living room, the ghosts of Tate Langdon and Dr. Ben Harmon are talking about Tate's frustration at being ignored by Ben's daughter, Violet. They are interrupted by Madison and Behold, who announce that they have come to learn about Michael Langdon's origins, but both refuse to speak. Madison is then attacked by the deformed boy, Beauregard Langdon, but medium Billie Dean Howard arrives and subdues Beauregard. Constance Langdon, Tate and Beauregard's mother, appears and states that she is the true owner of the house. Behold and Madison express their desire to talk about Michael. Constance says that she will talk only if they rid her rival Moira's spirit from the house. They unearth Moira's remains from the backyard and buries them with Moira's mother. Her spirit is released from her earthly hold and greeted by the spirit of her mother. The two pass peacefully into the afterlife. Constance tells the story of Michael Langdon to Madison and Behold, revealing that his father is her son Tate. After Vivien Harmon gave birth, Constance took Michael from the house and raised him as her own son, believing she had been given a new chance at being a mother. However, Michael quickly becomes violent, first killing small animals and eventually murdering his nanny at the age of three. Soon after, Michael aged ten years overnight and appeared as a teenager. Michael attacked Constance, then murdered a priest from whom she sought help. With her dreams of motherhood shattered, Constance returned to the Murder House and committed suicide by overdose. Behold and Madison approach Ben, who is estranged from Vivien. He tells the two that a father-son relationship developed between the two, much to Vivien's disappointment. However, Michael learned that Tate is his father and grew darker after being rejected by him. Ben witnessed Michael mutilating the ghost of Elizabeth Short, as well as murdering and permanently expelling the spirits of two new residents from existence. Afterwards, Ben ended their sessions. At this point, Vivien appears and reconciles with Ben. Vivien tells the story of a group of Satanists who arrived at the house, consisting of Miriam Mead, Samantha Crowe and Church of Satan founder, Anton LaVey. The Satanists kidnapped a young woman and brought her to the house to perform a Black Mass. Vivien failed in her attempt to murder Michael, and narrowly escapes the destruction of her own spirit through the intervention of Tate. Vivien tells Behold and Madison that Michael Langdon is not a warlock but the Antichrist. Before leaving, Madison meets Violet. Violet tells Madison that Tate is a monster, but Madison believes that Tate was a vessel used by the house to conceive Michael and tells Violet that Tate is not the true evil. Madison uses her magic to prove it to Violet, leading to their reconciliation. Madison locks the gates as she and Behold depart the house. Reception =Ratings= \\"Return to Murder House\\" was watched by 2.01 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.9 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. =Reviews= The episode has received widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike.

It feels like something of a return to form. The season has been very impressive, and a lot of fun to boot. The shorter episode order seems to be beneficial to the pace of the show, and the merged seasons has given Apocalypse the best parts of both Murder House and Coven, with horror, weirdness, and wit in equal measure.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A. She praised the return of multiple Murder House characters, especially Vivien's (Britton) and Constance's (Lange). She also enjoyed the latter's flashbacks with Michael, calling them \\"an illuminating history for Michael as well as an epic monologue for Jessica Lange\\". Finally, she was a big fan of the dynamics between Billy Porter and Emma Roberts, commenting that it was the \\"greatest thing about this season\\" after Lange's return. Vultures Ziwe Fumudoh gave the episode a 5 out of 5, with a positive review. She commented that \\"this episode was everything I dreamed of\\", calling it \\"the most ambitious crossover event in history\\". Much like Rosenfield, she praised the dynamics between Porter and Roberts, and was a huge fan of Jessica Lange's performance. Moreover, she enjoyed the reunion between Moira and her mother, saying that the scene was \\"a touching moment\\". Finally, she praised the writing and direction of the episode. =Reaction from individuals involved= The Church of Satan criticized the episode for its inaccurate portrayal of Anton LaVey and of Satanists in general, pointing out that LaVey did not believe in the Antichrist or practice ritual sacrifice.

Her whereabouts are unknown, but two coronial inquests have found that she had been murdered. In December 2018, Chris Dawson was charged with her murder and, in June 2019, pleaded not guilty. Background Lynette Simms and Chris Dawson, both aged sixteen, met at a high-school function in 1965. They were married in 1970 at St Jude's Church, Randwick in Sydney and later had two children. A former professional rugby league footballer for the Newtown Jets, Chris Dawson was a physical education teacher at Cromer High School. In 1981, he commenced an extramarital affair with student Joanne Curtis. In October 1981, Curtis temporarily moved into the Dawson family home at Chris Dawson's invitation. Dawson was phoned by her mother on 8 January 1982, the last time they would communicate with each other. She planned to meet her mother and family at Northbridge Baths the following day, but she never arrived. Curtis permanently moved into the Dawson residence on 10 January 1982. Chris Dawson reported his wife missing on 18 February 1982, six weeks after her disappearance. Chris Dawson claimed that she left after marital problems caused over her Bankcard spending. In a statement to police, he suggested that there was a possibility that she joined a religious organisation. Chris Dawson finalised divorce proceedings against Dawson in 1983; and the following year married Curtis.  Investigation  Early investigations by New South Wales Police were inconclusive. The NSW State Coroner conducted two coronial inquiries into the disappearance of Dawson. At the first inquest held in February 2001, the Deputy State Coroner Jan Stevenson determined that Dawson had been murdered and that her killer was someone she knew. The coroner recommended charges be laid; however Nicholas Cowdery , the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions, assessed that there was insufficient evidence for a criminal conviction. A second inquest, held in February 2003 by State Coroner Carl Milovanovich, recommended Chris be charged with the murder of Dawson. Cowdery again refused to prosecute Dawson, citing the lack of evidence. In April 2018, following extensive investigations, NSW Police requested the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to review its brief of evidence. Chris Dawson was arrested in Queensland in December 2018, extradited to New South Wales, and charged with the murder of Dawson. He was granted bail; and in June 2019 pleaded not guilty to her murder. In February 2020, he was committed to stand trial for the murder of Dawson. He is also facing a charge of carnal knowledge with a girl between the ages of 10 and 17. This charge relates to his time as a teacher in the 1970s and 1980s.  Media  A 16-episode podcast series, The Teacher's Pet, by Walkley Award winning journalist Hedley Thomas, was broadcast in 2018 with large amounts of evidence that was not collected by any of the police investigations. The series had over 28 million downloads before being taken down, and has seen a large media and public interest in the case.

It was completed in 1930 as a cine-variety theatre with a capacity of 2226 seats. Architect George Coles decided for an Egyptian style facade dressed in multi-coloured Hathernware tiles. The discovery of Tutankhamun‚Äôs tomb in November 1922 influenced the Art Deco style and the buildings erected in that period, particularly cinemas and theatres. Inside the building is mainly Empire style, with Egyptian decorations in the foyer, whilst the auditorium has a French Renaissance style. The Carlton Cinema was taken over by Associated British Cinemas Ltd. (ABC) in February 1935. It was re-named ABC in 1962.

It was released on October 4, 2018 by SM Entertainment and distributed by IRIVER. The album debuted at number two on the Gaon Album Chart in its first week and also charted at number ten on Billboards World Albums chart. Background The First Scene was recorded between 2017 and 2018 and was difficult to prepare due to Yuri's tight schedule with her acting career, reality TV filming and various activities with her group, Girls' Generation. In January 2018, after the release of her single \\"Always Find You\\" featuring DJ Raiden, Yuri addressed her fans' requests for a solo album on the SBS Power FM radio show Park So Hyun's Love Game and stated that \\"the timing wasn't right\\" but she's \\"always thinking about it and preparing for it\\". She then said that if they're willing to wait, she will \\"release one at any time\\". On September 20, it was reported that the singer was planning on making her solo debut, 11 years into her career, through the release of an album which was subsequently confirmed by a source from her label SM Entertainment. On September 27, SM Entertainment posted a series of teasers for the album on their official SNS accounts, which Forbes stated exuded \\"confident sensuality\\" that would have been unthinkable years ago when the group's \\"brand of peppy girlishness was at its peak\\". Yuri wanted her album to reflect her personal image in her group, so she made sure it showed \\"sexiness, femininity and beauty\\". A timeline for the remaining teasers and the release of the album was also included, along with some details about the extended play which will contain six tracks, including the lead single \\"Into You (Îπ†Ï†∏Í∞Ä)\\". Yonhap News also reported that Yuri planned on doing active promotions for the album. The album was released on October 4, 2018. Composition Tamar Herman of Billboard described the title track \\"Into You\\" as \\"a rhythmic dance track with a captivating melody\\". She also wrote that throughout the song, Yuri \\"plays up her airy tone, vacillating between piano-backed croons and dramatic belts over whirring synths as she pulls back and lets loose, letting her vocals blend with pulsating, rumbling beats, and one-off quirks, like the popping sound of a champagne bottle being opened, to create a soundscape of a dreamy night out\\". At her debut showcase on October 4, Yuri revealed that the Girls' Generation unit Oh!GG's debut song \\"Lil' Touch\\", which was released the previous month and Yuri was also a part of, was one of the two choices for her debut single but the company ultimately went with \\"Into You\\" since \\"Lil' Touch\\" was faster and would fit a group more. Herman characterized the second track \\"Illusion\\" as a groovy dance track, \\"C'est La Vie! (That's LIFE!)\\" as a creeping retro-pop track, \\"Butterfly\\" as a soft pop song and \\"Chapter 2\\" as a ballad. Promotions Yuri appeared as a guest on the October 3, 2018 episode of the MBC variety show Weekly Idol where she discussed her upcoming debut album and performed a snippet of her song. She held a debut showcase in Seoul on October 4, 2018, which was broadcast live through the Naver app V Live. There, the singer performed the single \\"Into You\\" live for the first time, along with another track from the album, \\"Illusion\\". She also discussed her preparations for the album. Yuri had her debut stage on the music program Music Bank on October 5, 2018, performing both \\"Into You\\" and \\"Illusion\\". The singer also performed the two songs on Show! Music Core and Inkigayo. Reception Upon its release, The First Scene topped the iTunes album chart in more than 14 countries' all over the world and debuted at number 10 on Billboards World Albums chart in its first week with only one day to garner points to enter it.

Ita-bags began to appear in Japanese popular culture in the 2010s, and were covered by national news beginning in 2015. They have themselves been depicted in anime, e.g. in Sh≈çnen Hollywood (2014).

In both cases, the \\"pain\\" refers to the pain inflicted on the bag or car, and to the owner's wallet. Ita-bags are an expensive hobby, given that some buttons are of a limited edition and command high prices. Some fans spend more than the equivalent of a thousand U.S. dollars on their ita- bags.

History The building, located on Lowside, Bowness, dates from around 1650. Thomas Longmire, a noted wrestler of his era, was landlord of the inn between 1852 and 1862. The New Hall Inn gained its pub licence in 1866. The New Hall Inn was acquired by John Booth of the Old Brewery, Ulverston, in 1880, and numerous changes to the pub were made. The pub was one of the largest in Bowness by 1890, by which time it was known locally as the \\"Hole in the Wall\\", or \\"Hole in t'Wall\\" in regional dialect. The origin of the name is not entirely certain; there may have been in a literal hole in the wall of the building to pass drinks to the neighbouring blacksmith and ostlers. The inn was the oldest licensed house in Bowness by 1907, and appealed to a working class clientele, particularly boatmen. A 1931 account describes the pub as a place where dominoes and darts could be played, and where mild beer was served. The building gained its Grade II listing in 1973.

The abbey has an early-Gothic Basilica with the largest organ in the Westerwald, a library, a brewery with restaurant, a shop for books and art, a guest house, and a privately supported secondary school, the Privates Gymnasium Marienstatt.  History  Exterior of the church The abbey was established by Heisterbach Abbey, which was created by Himmerod Abbey, which in turn was founded from Clairvaux Abbey in 1134, in a direct succession. In 1212, it was first founded in Neunkhausen, made possible by a donation from Eberhard of Arenberg and his wife Adelheid von Molsberg. The site was abandoned because of the climate and soil, and the monastery was transferred to the present location in 1222. According to legend, the abbot had a dream of a hawthorn bush that flowered in winter, which led him to choose the new site. The first church there was consecrated on 27 December 1227 under Conrad, the third abbot. The monastery at the time belonged to the Diocese of Cologne. From 1476, lay people were permitted to attend services in the abbey church, and in 1485 the pilgrimage day was made the octave of Corpus Christi.abtei- marienstatt.de: Geschichte (Year 1486). From 1561, the Counts of Sayn introduced the Reformation in their territories.Daniel Schneider: Die Entwicklung der Konfessionen in der Grafschaft Sayn im Grundriss, in: Heimat- Jahrbuch des Kreises Altenkirchen 58 (2015), pp. 74‚Äì80. In the Thirty Years' War, Sweden claimed the property as Swedish crown land on 3 October 1633, expelling the brothers and vandalizing the premises. Some brothers returned when the Swedes left. However, abbot Johannes Wittig lived with only one brother and one novice there in 1637. After the war, the monastery flourished again, and most present buildings were erected. Under abbot Benedikt Bach, the church was decorated in Baroque style. The old buildings were demolished and replaced from 1735 to 1751 under Petrus Emons. The monastery served as an infirmary during the War of the First Coalition in 1794/95 and 1796/97. On 19 October 1802, the abbey was dissolved as part of secularisation and was given to Frederick William, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg. The last brothers left in 1803, but Catholic masses were still held. From 1831, masses were officially tolerated by the Nassau government, when the abbey church became the church of a new parish, Marienstatt, saving it from demolition. In 1842, Nassau County bought the buildings back in poor condition, but plans for a workhouse were not carried out. On 18 May 1864 the county sold Marienstatt to the Bishop of Limburg, , who established a home for neglected boys. It was directed by members of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit. When the order was dissolved during the 1873 Kulturkampf, diocesan priests took over. They were supported by sisters of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ. Eventually, the institution was moved to Kloster Marienhausen in Aulhausen.Katharina Kasper: Schriften. vol. I, pp. 166ff. In 1888, the abbey was bought back by brothers of the Wettingen-Mehrerau Abbey. The abbot (and later Bishop of Limburg) cared for a new settlement, now as part of the . In 1909, abbot Konrad II Kolb built a library and in 1910 opened an Oblatenschule, a school for the preparation of young men for the order. During the Nazi regime, the abbey was almost closed. During World War II, it served again as an infirmary, and as a home for children from Dormagen, senior citizens from Frankfurt am Main, and the Jesuit college Sankt Georgen. After the war, the school was reopened and expanded into a gymnasium with boarding facility, .Privates Gymnasium der Zisterzienserabtei Marienstatt (ed.): Einhundertjahrbuch. 100 Jahre Schule in Marienstatt. 1910‚Äì2010.

The church belongs to the state of Rhineland- Palatinate, while the other buildings belong to the Cistercian abbey. In 2015, the parish was merged into a larger parish, Maria Himmelfahrt Hachenburg. Church organ In the 16th century, the church had an organ installed in a Schwalbennest on the north wall. At the end of the 18th century, a large organ was on a balcony in front of the west window. In 1854, Daniel Ra√ümann from M√∂ttau replaced it with an instrument with 16 stops on two manuals and pedal, reusing some material from the former instrument. The organ and the balcony were demolished in 1941 when the church was restored. A choir organ served the chorale singing from 1912, with 45 stops. During the restoration, it was relocated to the parish hall. In 1950, Anton Feith from Paderborn used material from this organ to build a new instrument. It was sold to the parish St. Peter (K√∂ln-Neuehrenfeld) in 1964, while the abbey church used a small rented organ. Rieger organ The present organ was built from 1969 to 1970 by Franz Rieger. The organ features the only authentic Spanische Trompete outside Spain, dating back to 1732. The organ was expanded in 2006 and 2007 by Orgelbau Romanus Seifert & Sohn from Kevelaer. In 2015, the organ was expanded by three stops. It now has 67 stops (more than 5,000 pipes) on four manuals and pedal, the largest organ in the region.Die gro√üe Rieger-Orgel July 2018  Gallery  Abtei Marienstatt - Klostergeb√§ude.jpgAbbey buildings Wallfahrer in Marienstatt.jpgPilgrims arriving Wallfahrt in Marienstatt.jpgPilgrimage Wallfahrer mit Fahnen in Marienstatt.jpgPilgrims with flags  Literature  * R.

She was the co-founder of the Caldecott Community, a pioneering boarding school in Kent for distressed and vulnerable children, and served as its director for over 50 years. Life and career Rendel was born in London to an upper-middle-class family active in liberal and radical causes. Her father, William Stuart Rendel, was a civil engineer. He was the son of Alexander Meadows Rendel and the nephew of Stuart Rendel. Her mother, Ruth Frances n√©e Paul, was the daughter of the publisher Kegan Paul. Leila was the eldest of three siblings. Her sister, Olive, became an obstetrician and later wrote a book on the use of exercise in the post-war rehabilitation of children. Her brother, Robert, became a stage and film actor. Rendel left school at 15 after which she was educated by a governess and later attended a school in Wimbledon run by the French feminist Marie Souvestre. After her father's death in 1898, Rendel spent most of her early adult life at the Bloomsbury home of her grandfather, Alexander Rendel. During that period she developed close relationships with her aunt, Edith Rendel, and her cousin, Mary Stocks, both of whom were active suffragists and social reformers. Rendel initially trained as teacher of physical education at Chelsea College of Physical Training from 1902 to 1904. In 1905 she was appointed to the teaching staff of the newly established Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Training, and in 1908 was the first woman to be appointed an inspector of physical training by the Board of Education. However, from her early 20s, she had also developed a keen interest in nursery education and the ideas of the nursery education pioneer Margaret McMillan. Her interest was further spurred in 1908 when her aunt Edith opened a large day nursery in the St Pancras district of London. In her spare time Rendel and her friend Phyllis Potter began running a nursery class in Whitefield's Tabernacle on Tottenham Court Road. In 1911, Rendel and Potter decided to set up their own nursery school based on the progressive ideas of McMillan and Edith Rendel. It was located at Cartwright Gardens in St Pancras and mainly catered to the children of women working in a nearby matchbox factory. An admirer of Randolph Caldecott's children's book illustrations, she named the school The Caldecott Community and adorned its walls with Caldecott's pictures. Rendel's grandfather, Alexander, provided them with an endowment and further donations were received from her large circle of family and friends. By 1914 the school was well-established with a written constitution and the Professor of Education at the University of London as its chairman. Princess Louise served as its president. The condemnation of the St Pancras building by the local council in 1917 and the continued German bombing of London led the Caldecott Community to move with its teachers and children to Maidstone. In the process it became the first co-educational boarding school in the UK for working-class children. Over the course of the next 20 years, the school increasingly took in distressed and vulnerable children whose family lives had been disrupted by death, illness, and divorce. The school moved several more times before finding a permanent home on 1947 in Mersham-le-Hatch, a large house surrounded by parkland located near Ashford in Kent. That same year with a grant from the Nuffield Trust, Rendel set up the first experimental reception centre in England to assess the most appropriate placement for children who had been taken into care. She was awarded an OBE for her work in the 1948 New Year Honours. In 1967, Rendel began retiring from active directorship of the Caldecott Community but remained active in the school's life. She died two years later at the age of 86 while undergoing surgery after a fall at her house on the grounds of the school. According to her biographer, Simon Rodway, she had suffered a broken hip in the fall and while lying on the floor and waiting for the ambulance, she insisted on reading the latest book on child care.

This open acknowledgment of the Macedonian national identity led to the creation of a revisionist historiography whose goal has been to affirm the existence of the Macedonian nation through the history. Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans. Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history. The claim is that most of the Slavic population of Macedonia in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was ethnic Macedonian. For more see: Victor Roudometof, Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, , p. 58; Victor Roudometof, Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question in Journal of Modern Greek Studies 14.2 (1996) 253-301.Yugoslav Communists recognized the existence of a Macedonian nationality during WWII to quiet fears of the Macedonian population that a communist Yugoslavia would continue to follow the former Yugoslav policy of forced Serbianization. Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia. For more see: Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R. King, Yugoslav communism and the Macedonian question, Archon Books, 1971, , Chapter 9: The encouragement of Macedonian culture. he was ethnic Macedonian.Although Yugoslav-era historians in the Republic of Macedonia objected to Kirov- Majski's classification of Macedonia's Slavic population as Bulgarian, they quickly embraced all else in his narrative of events and attitudes in 1903 as definitive.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The complex has been converted to residential use. Description and history The former Meriden Curtain Fixture Company Factory is located two blocks south of Main Street in central Meriden, occupying most of one city block on the north side of Charles Street between Broad Street and Parker Avenue. The factory consists of six buildings, five of which are connected in a roughly linear east-west arrangement; the sixth, the generator/boiler house, is detached and stands to the north. The buildings range in height from one to six stories, with building 3, the tallest, capped by a distinctive mansard roof. The complex is unified visually by band of decorative tilework just below the roofline. With The curtain fixture business was begun in 1869 by Sawyer & Buckley, and was later taken over by the Charles Parker Company. Parker, then managed by Charles Parker's son Wilbur, greatly expanded the business, overseeing construction of the majority of this complex in 1892. It was the largest manufacturer in the nation that produced curtain rollers, fringing, and curtain cloth. The business was acquired in 1905 by the Columbia Shade Company. In the 20th century it had a variety of smaller tenants, and was eventually converted to residential use.

Each one of these armed forces and their subsections have their own uniforms. The style of these historical uniforms can be traced back to the Royal Sardinian Army in the mid-19th Century, which was the predecessor of the current Italian Armed Forces. History The uniforms of the Italian Armed Forces, at first, had symbolic meanings and later on, became more function and grade-based. During Spedizione dei Mille (an event during the war for the Italian Unification, nationally called Risorgimento), where Giuseppe Garibaldi's volunteer troops unofficially helped the King of Savoy to conquer the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, all of the troops wore red shirts, following the example of Garibaldi's Italian Legion that had fought in the Guerra Grande in South America. This earned the volunteer troops the nickname: the Camicie rosse. The first historical records of the actual Italian military uniform are dated back to the Statute conceded by the King (called Statuto Albertino) of the Royal Italian Army () in 1861, the year of Italian Unification. The soldiers of the Royal Army dressed in green coloured uniforms with black boots and helmets. The black uniforms of Mussolini's militia, the Camicie Nere, is another symbolic army uniform in Italian history. Il Duce based these black uniforms on the uniforms of the Arditi, a special unit of the Italian Royal Army that fought in the First World War. During the World Wars, uniforms were prepared and manufactured in military factories. In 2000, the voluntary military service for women was started and female uniforms now represent 7% of all Italian military uniforms. Marina Militare (Navy) thumb The Italian Navy (, abbreviated as MM) is the Navy of the Italian Republic. The Italian Navy is divided into different corps: Corps of Staff Officers (SM), Corps of Naval Engineering (GN), Corps of the Naval Arms (AN), Maritime Military Medical Corps (MD) for medics and for Pharmacists (FM), Corps of Military Maritime Commissariat (CM), Corps of the Port Captaincies (CP), Corps of the Military Maritime Crews (CEMM). Since 1861, the materials and uniforms used by the Italian Navy have been adjusted and often re-designed as the service evolved. The current uniforms are based on the Marina Militare rank system, and come with variations in rank and on a seasonal basis. The uniforms also vary depending on the location where the personnel are serving, with different uniforms for serving on ships, naval planes, submarines or land locations. =Design= The design of the uniforms is based on the rank of the personnel (officers, marshals, troops and cadets). The uniforms change seasonally for summer and winter, and have different uniforms for the different departments of the Navy. The uniforms are also made of different textile materials. There is also an operational uniform that the Navy uses. Regular Uniform The standard uniform used by regular troops is the same for male and female personnel, with the exception of the jacket in the winter version (six-buttons for male and a three-buttons for female personnel), and it presents two seasonal variations for summer and winter. The winter uniform is fully colored in a dark-blue, with the same color for its accessories, such as the hat's brim (the hat itself is white on top, with the MM symbol sewn on it), the gloves, shoes and tie. A white shirt is worn underneath. The female personnel are also allowed to carry a bag and substitute the classic cut trousers with a skirt. The summer uniform is composed of a short-sleeved white shirt, worn with another white T-shirt underneath, both of which are tucked into the classical-cut white trousers and tightened by a belt with a golden colored buckle. The shoes are white, as well as the hat (whose brim remains black like the winter version). As for the winter version, female personnel can carry a white bag. Ceremonial Uniform The Ceremonial Uniform has two seasonal variations for summer and winter. There are some common features such as the hat, which remains white on top with a black brim and the Italian Navy symbol sewn on the front; the light blue band passing from the right shoulder and tied to the opposite hip; the black shoes and a sword, the hilt of which is coloured in gold. The different variations are mainly based on the choice of the color and in the weight of the material used. The summer version is lighter and almost entirely white colored, with black and golden shoulder pads. The winter version comes with a six-button black jacket, classical cut black trousers and a white shirt worn underneath. A black tie completes the uniform. =Special Forces= GOI The Operational Raider Group (, abbreviated as GOI) is part of the Italian Special Forces and is one of the two sections that form the COMSUBIN. The GOI have different uniforms, including a scuba diving one. After being transported in a submarine, they use diving in order to stealthily reach places while remaining undercover. Another characteristic of this uniform is the harness used for steep access and egress points above water. GOS The Operational Divers Group (, abbreviated as GOS) is a special unit that is deployed for conducting any interventions in depths (of the sea) that reach more than 1000 meters underwater. The uniform used is fully black, with transparent scuba glasses, a torch mounted on top of the helmet and two oxygen tanks attached to the back of the operator. Esercito Italiano (Army) alt= The uniforms that are currently in use by the Italian Army (, abbreviated as EI) can be divided into four \\"families\\": the Regular Uniform (the only one that includes seasonal variations), the Service Uniform, the Service Combat Uniform, and the Ceremonial Uniform. There are precise laws that regulate Armed Forces‚Äô uniforms regarding the type of material, color and badge. These military uniforms can only be sold to verified collectors and Army personnel. Civilians are allowed buy the ordinary uniform without the Army's coat of arms. =Design= Regular Uniform The Regular Uniform consists of a single-breasted jacket with four buttons and four pockets. Trousers come with a classic cut and the front pleats have five pockets, one of which is for a pocket watch. The shirt worn underneath also has two small pockets. The uniform is completed with a necktie, brown leather gloves, brown shoes, khaki socks and a cap or headdress. Both summer and winter versions differ from each other in the materials that are used when making them.  Service Uniform  thumb The summer and winter Service Uniform have identical cuts and colors with the Regular uniform, while active military personnel always utilize a special headdress. Service Combat Uniform The Service Combat Uniform is the most used uniform, and it is distributed to all soldiers with the same mimetic pattern (paratroopers have a different model with a strengthening on the shoulders). It is composed of a beret, a five button closure jacket with two internal pockets, and trousers with four pockets: two posterior and one in the middle of each thigh. Accessories completing the uniform include gloves, special footwear and a T-shirt with short or long sleeves, depending on the season. If the activity or the situation requires so, a raincoat made up of a thermo lining and a warm windbreaker are added. The Combat version is composed of a helmet, an anti-reflection tarp, a scarf and a belt with glove compartment to the basic Service Uniform. When needed, the uniform is equipped with a bulletproof vest. Alpines troops utilize a different hat, with an eagle feather on the left side, and each unit has a different pompom color. Ceremonial Uniform The Ceremonial Uniform includes a double-breasted jacket with six buttons and two pockets on the hips. Trousers come with a classic cut in fabric, as well as the jacket. The winter version is composed of a blue cape infantry, a black rigid cap, white gloves and black shoes. There are other accessories such as the necktie, a light blue scarf and a sabre that complete the uniform. alt= =Historical Uniforms= Historical uniforms are used in Military schools, the Military Academy, NCO schools and some regiments. They recall the light blue uniforms of the Savoy army. The Armed Force's choice of headgear is the beret, used since the 1980s (adapted from the side cap), and is the most worn headdress by Italian troops. Each color or model has an historical reason and it also exists in a female version. The ribbon on the cylindrical part of the headgear differs for the Officials. Grey-green Italian military troops adopted the grey-green uniform prior to WWI in 1908. It was Luigi Brioschi, president of the Milanese section of the C.A.I. (Italian Alpine Club) in 1905 who presented a combat uniform more suitable for modern war, replacing the showy uniforms of the Royal Sardinian Army. Brioschi demonstrated the benefits of his grey green uniform on painted targets set out at varying distances, and so the project was financed and uniforms in his \\"Grigio Verde\\" were adopted December 4, 1908. Grey-green uniforms have been utilized for forty years, including in the two World Wars. Nowadays they are a symbol for the Army and some Army Corps still currently use them for special occasions. Model 40 It was possible to update the grey-green uniforms in order to adjust them for World War II. The Officers, NCOs and troops uniforms differed from each other in the cloth's quality and workmanship. The Model 40 uniform abolished the colored or black velvet collars. Troops had a three-button jacket (known also as a sahariana), which included four patch-pockets with a central pleat closed by small buttons, and it was partially lined. Trousers were different for cavalry and infantry. They were secured on the calf by knee-length socks or by leather chaps. A cloth belt with small buttons clamped around the waist. NCOs and Officials utilized a lighter color than troops, and they were allowed to adapt their uniforms during the war. Khaki During the Italian War of Liberation in 1943, the personnel received khaki uniforms from the British Army, including a short jacket with a button panel in sight and two large pockets with a button and turn-up. Trousers had six pockets and they were secured to the ankles through two canvas buckles. The footwear used were long black boots that came up to the ankle. A campaign hat and pan helmet completed the uniform. The recognizable elements of the Italian khaki uniforms were the insignia and the grade emblems. Despite paratroopers preferring the khaki uniforms, they continued to wear the grey-green berets, helmets and the traditional campaign hats. =Special Forces= Folgore On 10 June 1967, the Paratroopers Brigade granted the name ‚ÄúFolgore‚Äù to the Battaglione Paracadutisti, and the beret's color subsequently changed to amaranth (a colour adopted by many paratrooper units all over the world).left Col Moschin The Italian 9th paratrooper assault regiment is a special forces‚Äô department of the Italian Army. In 1997, Col Moschin re-adopted the traditional insignia of the Arditi in the Great War. It was added to the bomb with a flame on the left, overlapped by two crossed daggers, the paratrooper's canopy and the right wing of the Aviotruppe's medal. Granatieri di Sardegna The Granatieri di Sardegna is one of the oldest regiments in the Italian army. The force originated in Sardinia is now based in Rome. This corp is responsible for the guarding of the president. The regiment has its own traditional uniform. The uniform is black with red ornaments and contains a big black hat almost similar to that of the British Queen's Guard. Alpini The Alpini are the oldest mountain infantry in the world and one of the Italian special forces. A special feature of their uniform is the Cappello Alpino, that carries a black raven feather, a garment that gave this force the nickname: \\"The Black feathers\\" (). Officers traditionally had a white eagle feather instead of the black one. When the force was created, the hat worn was made of black felt. This was changed when the new green-grey uniform was adopted in 1909. Since then, the hat was changed to the distinctive grey felt that is currently being used. The Alpini has distinctive green cuffs on the dark blue tunics worn for full dress and barrack dress before 1915, and by the green piping on their light blue/grey trousers. When grey-green service uniforms were tried out by the Alpini in 1906, before the entire army adopted them in 1909, the distinctive green collar patches and typical headdress were retained and are still in service. Aeronautica Militare (Air Force) alt= =Design= The uniforms of the Italian Air Force (, abbreviated as AM) includes a hand-tailored dress tunic that is made of a medium blue-grey colored wool. The uniform consists of a buttoned jacket and trousers, with a double buckled belt holding the jacket together to make the appearance of the serviceman more neat and trimmed down. It is worn with a white shirt and a blue or black tie. The first planes of the Italian Air Force were not equipped with a closed cabin for the pilots, so earlier versions of the uniforms for pilots included helmets and goggles. Regular Uniform The Air Force uniform no longer includes the helmets as part of the standard uniform. The uniforms vary also according to their department. These can be classified in the training department, flight department, support department, aerial defence department and a unit consisting of production. Unique to the Air Force uniforms is that in the public sector, the brand Aeronautica Militare has the license given by the Italian Air Force to produce and sell fashion that is based on the looks and designs of the Air Force uniforms. =Special Forces= 17¬∞ Stormo Incursori This Italian Air Force special forces unit, the 17th Raiders Wing (), was created during the Second World War. They are equipped with a military green uniform, including a multi- pocket jacket used to hold any kind of equipment or other devices needed in order to ensure versatility and total functionality when in use. Arma dei Carabinieri (Gendarmerie) alt= thumb In Italy, there are two mainItalian state police forces also include Guardia di Finanza, essentially responsible for dealing with financial crime and smuggling, and Polizia Penitenziaria, i.e. penitentiary police ( La sicurezza e le Forze dell‚ÄôOrdine in Italia ‚Äî \\"Il grande portale della lingua italiana\\"). A fifth law enforcement agency, Corpo forestale dello stato, was disbanded in 2016. police forces. The regular state police, the Polizia, and the Carabinieri. The Carabinieri were part of the Italian Army until the early 2000s. Since then, they are considered as an independent part of the Italian Armed Forces. The first nine written rules about Tuscany uniforms for Carabinieri date back to 9 August 1814 and recite the first design of the uniforms. =Design= The uniform that the Gendarmerie wore in 1814 consisted of a turquoise fabric buttoned suit with a blue collar and padded gloves. Since 1822, some small changes have been made to the uniform. Officials and Marshals had silver swords and sabers, both in a black leather scabbard. At the beginning of the 20th Century, the rules of the dress code were reinforced because of World War I. Troops had three different types of uniforms: the Complete uniform, the Ordinary uniform, and the Effort uniform. In 1940, Italy was one of the many countries that fought in World War II. The Carabinieri's uniform at that time was made of a green-grey cloth material, and was used by all soldiers. Ceremonial Uniform For historical and ceremonial use, the Carabinieri uniform consists of a distinctive black uniform made of silver braids around the collar and cuffs, edges trimmed in scarlet and epaulettes in silver. The fringes of the mounted division are white, and the infantry has light blue. The headgear used is the traditional two-pointed hat for Carabinieri, known as the Lucerna, also called a bicorne. In the Eighties Giorgio Armani designed the new more modern uniforms. Regular Uniform The modern Carabinieri Force uniform is colored in black for every seasonal version, with small variations on weather basis (coat or wind jacket), and is composed of a four-button jacket with shoulder pads: all buttons on the uniform are silvered. The shirt underneath is white, with two pockets. The trousers have a classic cut, with four pockets and has two vertical red stripes along the outer side of both legs, stretching from the hips to the ankles. Flat black shoes are worn. The uniform is accompanied by accessories such as the black tie and, occasionally, black leather gloves. The rigid hat presents the Arma's frieze.alt= =Special Forces= Under the Carabinieri, there are also special police forces in charge with both internal and external security, each with their own uniforms. GIS The Carabinieri's section of Special Intervention Group (, abbreviated as GIS) is an anti-terrorism unit founded in 1978. The color of the uniform utilized by this √©lite force is usually the dark blue, even though mimetic and desert variations exist. Reinforcements such as helmets, knee pads, elbow pads or bulletproof jackets are composed of fireproof and insulating materials. Calabrian and Sardinian Hunters Calabrian and Sardinian Hunters () are one of the special section of support for the Arma dei Carabinieri. Due to the generally milder weather and the rocky features of the southern landscape, the Hunters' uniforms consist of a lighter battle dress with a dark green camouflage pattern, together with leather gloves and combat boots. Also present with the uniform is a distinctive bright red beret, with the Carabinieri symbol sewn onto it. Sicilian Hunters The Sicilian Hunters () are a special paratroop unit of the Carabinieri based in Sicily. This unit is mainly tasked to search for fugitives in the Sicilian mountains. Besides the normal Carabinieri uniforms, this troop also possesses operational uniforms like the other Hunter squadrons. The operative uniform has an extra blue neckerchief, leather gloves and combat boots.

Purpose The militias that were listed in the army of Queen Victoria were those units created by the Militia Act of 1757. In 1881, the British army was reorganised and militia regiments were then directly associated with county regiments of the regular army (losing their unique status), adopting their county regiment's name and battalion numbering system. In 1908 they would designated Special Reserve battalions. The purpose of these units was to act as a territorially based force of able-bodied men to serve in Dorset and in time of war would report for duty such as defending against invasion by the French. They were not supposed to serve overseas, although the county militias acted as feeder units for officers and recruits to the regular army in times of needAnn Hudson, Volunteer soldiers in Sussex during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1793-1815, Sussex Archaeological Collections 122, pp. 165-81. In the case although militias had been complete throughout England, it was in 1794 that greater emphasis was put on the defensive value, particularly in the coastal regions of the kingdom. This was the period in our history that the French would be so much our implacable foe, Napoleon Bonaparte's power grew in Europe. However, in 1798 the Dorset did deploy to assist in a force suppressing a French-supported rebellion in southern Ireland; along with its neighbouring militia from Devon.. Insignia Examples of the Dorset Militia cap badge are not common and where they do exist they appear to be of a standard Victorian Shako Plate with a crown an facetted eight-pointed star, with a central motif of an ornate numeral one surrounded by a belted title bearing the title \\"Dorset Militia\\", or in the case of the Glengarry badge a centre with the Gibraltar castle with motto Primus In Indis (First in India) and a circlet with \\"Dorsetshire\\" inscribed. Unit history There are records from the 16th Century that the counties of Dorset, Devon and Cornwall were of special interest in terms defending against invasion; and the Duke of Bedford was charged as Lord Lieutenant to compile lists of what indigenous supplies of men, horses and fighting equipment could be mustered as local militia. Members of the local Dorset gentry joined the militia and a number were painted in their uniforms, notably: * Colonel David Robert Michel painted by Thomas Gainsborough circa 1760 * Lieutenant Sir Gerard Napier painted by Joshua Reynolds circa 1762 * Colonel George Pitt, First Lord Rivers painted by Thomas Gainsborough circa 1768; and then by Thomas Beach circa 1780 and Thomas Gooch circa 1782 In 1814 the Dorset Militia were listed as serving in Ireland (along with other county militias) with the following as command group: * Colonel Richard Bingham (appointed as colonel in 1799) * Lieutenant Colonel Richard T Steward * Major Nathaniel T Still The Dorset Militia was wound down and disembodied at the end of the Napoleonic Wars ‚Äì surviving with barely any staff, as was the case with most of the county militias; although recalled briefly in 1830 to contain the spread of the Swing Riots; which never really affected Dorset. In 1842 & 1843 Hart's Army Lists record the Dorset Militia as disembodied (not active) with its honorary colonel as Edward the 2nd Earl of Rigby; the Adjutant was listed as Captain G WyattHart's Army Lists, New annual army list 1843. It was based at Dorchester. However, with the elevation of Napoleon III as Emperor in 1851 Britain again feared French continental adventurism (particularly in Belgium) and county militias were remobilised. In 1852 Dorset was expected to raise a militia of 506; augmented in 1853 with a further 308 men. This mobilisation prompted a change in unit command and Richard Hippisley Bingham became Colonel, relieving the Dorset Militia's former colonel Sir John James Smith, Bart on 26 July 1852. In 1881 (in common with all militias in Britain) the Dorset Militia ceased to exist as a unique unit. It became the 3rd Battalion the Dorset Regiment. Battle honours Unlike many militia units as well as funnelling reinforcements to its associated regiment on overseas operations in the late Georgian and Victorian Eras, the unit did deploy to Ireland in the late 18th Century. The Times of 1 September 1798Times Newspaper 1 September 1798 reported that the Dorset and Devon Militias deployed aboard the frigate to join a force that was opposing a French landing in support of the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

He was a descendant of the first Francis Daniel Pastorius, the founder of Germantown, Philadelphia, and his family relocated back to Philadelphia when Pastorius was a child. He graduated from William Penn Charter School and Harvard University. He joined the United States Navy during World War II and served aboard . After the war, Pastorius attended the University of Pennsylvania Law School, graduating in 1948. He was active in Republican Party politics in Philadelphia, and in 1952 Governor John S. Fine appointed him city treasurer to fill the unexpired term of Richardson Dilworth, who had been elected district attorney. City charter reforms that passed in 1951 purported to abolish the office of treasurer, but lawsuits over whether the office was a city office or a state office (and thus immune from the effects of the city charter) lingered into 1953. Pastorius was nominated for a full term in the election that year, but just before the election the Democratic-majority City Council abolished the office, converting the office to a civil service position. Pastorius was elected to the abolished office, leading the entire ticket with 288,707 votes, nearly 20,000 more than Jones. After the election, Pastorius and city coroner Edward E. Holloway announced plans for a lawsuit challenging the abolition of their offices. He claimed the abolition subverted democracy, saying \\"[i]f you permit an office to be abolished after the process of election has begun, you open the door to rigged elections.\\" He took his oath of office in January 1954 for the term to which he had been elected, but did not pursue the lawsuit and relinquished the office the next day. Pastorius returned to his law practice, and also served as head of the Cruiser Olympia Association, which saved the historic from destruction and turned it into a museum. In 1962, Pastorius died suddenly following a heart attack at the age of 41. He left no survivors. After a funeral at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Chestnut Hill, he was buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery.

This exposes the brain and allows operations like craniotomy and craniectomy to be done. The drill itself can be manually or electrically driven, and primarily consists of a hand piece and a drill bit which is a sharp tool that has the form similar to Archimedes screw, this instrument must be inserted into the drill chuck to perform holes and remove materials. The trepanation tool is generally equipped with a clutch which automatically disengages once it touches a softer tissue, thus preventing tears in the dura. For larger openings, the craniotome is a surgical instrument that has replaced manually pulled saw wires in craniotomies from the 1980s.  History  = Cranial drill = The oldest evidence of a hole being applied on a human's brain with a drill dates from c. 4,000 B.C. The oldest cranial drilling instrument was found in France, and subsequent use evidenced by the Ancient Romans, Egyptians, and in Trepanation in Mesoamerica. The practice of trepanning is also evidenced from Ancient Greece, North and South America, Africa, Polynesia and the Far East. The conceivable reasons why ancient humans developed the technique of drilling the head could be religious, ritual or medical factors. The first trepanning procedure consisted of different types or tools and techniques: at the beginning the only material that was available for use was a sharp and carved rock. The development of The Hippocratic Corpus, written in the fifth century B.C., is the first written source that can be found about trepanning. The aim of the procedure described in \\"on Wounds in the head\\" was to allow the stagnant blood to escape from the head through a hole. The drill that was used at the time is similar to the modern ones, but was operated by hand rotation. In the 15th century, people began to believe that drilling was a cure for mental problems due to a magical stone of madness or stone of folly in the head, which had to be removed. Paintings that portray this practice exist, the most significate ones include The Extraction of the Stone of Madness c. 1488-1516 by Hieronymus Bosch and A Surgeon Extracting the Stone of Folly by Pieter Huys. The exstraction of the stone of Madness, Hieronymus Bosch - Trepanation From the Renaissance ages, cranial drilling continued to evolve and surgical practice was used less due to the high mortality rate. It was used only for some interventions, such as the treatment of hemorrhages, depressed fractures and penetrating the head. Also the name for the surgery changed from trepanning to craniotomy. In the late 1860s, E.G. Squier a well- educated man who was an expert in archaeology discovered a skull in an ancient Inca cemetery. This specific skull was anticipated to be of pre-Columbian era. The skull exhibited a large rectangle-shaped hole on the top. The skull was brought it back to the United States, and his findings presented to the New York Academy of Medicine. Squier argued that the brain was injected with a tool called a burin which was used on woods and metals before. Traces showed human hand prints. He concluded that the skull and brain evidenced recovery from prehistoric brain surgery, potentially prolonging the patients life. Metallurgy was a technique that allowed the use of saws and scalpels. Other cultures came about experimenting through the usage of glass. Dr Bart Hughes has declared that evolution caused a decrease in partial brain functions, mainly in the human consciousness. Whereas others increased, like speech and reasoning. The changes in performance are due to the enhancement of the extensiveness of blood. Which is located in the capillaries of the human brain. These performances in the human brain are related to a higher level of vision. That a child still copes with because their membranes around the brain let them get in touch with dreams, imagination and intense perception. To reach ones goal, to increase his level of vision one must decideto remove a part of there skull by cutting a small disc of its bone. Hughes, conducted his first operation in 1962 on himself using an electric drill, surgical knife and a hypodermic needle. Amongst other surgeries on fellow collogues he operated. The medical and legal authorities declared that his discovery was awful and Hughes was sent to Dutch lunatic asylum. Craniontonomy set, 18th century; Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg Improvements in technology are replacing the basic hand cranial drill by an robotic drill. The robotic drill is a high pace drill that will allow surgeons to experience performance over 50 times faster. The robotic drill is still not used in the point of time.  Application  A cranial drill is currently used for Neurosurgery operations. The procedure of trepanning is applied to patients who suffer for example a traumatic brain injury or a stroke. In these cases, it might be necessary to drill a hole in the skull to be able to access the dura mater or the brain itself, and to relieve brain pressure or blood clots. With the use of modern types of cranial drills, surgeons are able to create holes in the bone structure without traumatizing underlying brain tissue. The drill's working tool tip consists of a spiral blade that is framed by a guard device with an angled cranium guide that rests against the inner layer of the skull bone. The dura guard pushes the dura mater downward while the craniotome is moved forward thus preventing dural tearing.  Types and design  A cranial drill is an essential instrument used by surgeons to drill in to the skull bone. Various types of drills are used by surgeons from the craniotomy, or oral surgeries. The cranial drill can be differentiated by the examinations of what kind of surgery have to be performed. They can be manually operated, operated by electricity, or by pneumatic motors. = Manual cranial drill = Vilebrequin - Mus√©e des Hospices civils de Lyon, Manual drill The rotating crank is typically connected to several cogs that sets pressure on the skull. This specific drill is not connected to any external power, and is used very little in today's operations. The manual cranial drill is the most used and predominant type of drill in surgery, and performs manually. Which, has an adjusted stopper based on the setting and where the bone is the most thickest to prevent plunging. Surgeons use this drill manually without any other procedures. Surgeons that use a hand-cranked drill often are required to employ a lot of upper body strength. = Electric cranial drill = The electric cranial drill is powered either by a battery or by electricity via wall sockets. = Pneumatic cranial drill = The pneumatic motor is known for its great speed, which makes surgery much easier and faster. It is driven by expanding compressed air. The use of this kind of mechanism has many advantages such as the ease of use through high peak velocities. Thanks to superior torque, this system has great performance and it is essential for complex revision operations. The surgical procedure is shorter than usual, so patients spend less time under anesthesia . Pneumatic high-speed craniotomes usually run at 40,000 to 80,000 rpm and have greatly facilitated intracranial approaches in neurosurgery. They are also employed to temporarily remove the vertebral arch in laminotomy. Scientific progress Technological progress to reduce surgery time and minimize risks for patients during surgery have been introduced in the field of cranial drills, primarily from machining. =CAD/CAM= CAD/CAM stands for computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing. Recentely in the medical field as well. It is used by surgeons to simplify and ease surgeries: in the case of trepanning, a processor collects information from 2D images, and then turns them into 3D images. The processor codifies this information so that the drill can, without any trouble, pierce the correct portion of the skull.

The poem is one of Hayden's most recognised works, together with another poem entitled The Middle Passage. The poem is about the father/son relationship ‚Äì recalling the poet's memories of his father, realizing that despite the distance between them there was a kind of love, real and intangible, shown by the father's efforts to improve his son's life, rather than by gifts or demonstrative affection. The author's words suggest that the son feels remorse that he failed to recognise this in his father's lifetime. History = Authorship history= 3-23-12 RobertHaydenRobert Hayden was born on August 4, 1913 and was brought up in a poor neighborhood by his foster parents, Sue Ellen Westerfield and William Hayden. His life with his foster parents was tumultuous with frequent bouts of verbal and physical violence. He was the first African American to be named as Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress (Poet Laureate). He is famous for writing about cultural themes and African American history. He died on February 25, 1980 at the age of 66. =Background= Those Winter Sundays is about Robert Hayden's boyhood. Robert grew up in a difficult environment, surrounded by fights and poverty, and due to these facts he didn't appreciate his foster parents' love as he should have. Through mental maturity, he regretfully learned that he neither knew nor appreciated the sacrifices that his parents and, generally, every parent makes out of parental love. = Publishing history= The first, original version of the poem, which was slightly different from the definitive version, was published in Hayden's A Ballad of Remembrance (1962). The common version is part of the book called Collected Poems by Robert Hayden, edited by Frederick Glaysher. In 1997, the poem was ranked in a Columbia University Press survey as the 266th most anthologized poem in English. Title The author wants the title to imply a sense of old age and exhausted behaviour. He is reminding us about those cold and dark Sundays during his youth. The poem is featured by a presence of alliteration and a narrative of many similar Sundays that seemed an enormous obstacle. Even if this poem is characterised by a mundane and unhappy moment of the author's life, he remembers these memories because of their unique coldness and silence. Themes and symbols The main focus of this poem is the love of parents for their children, but this kind of love can be easily misunderstood by the latter, as it isn't about being kind and saying lovely words but instead are all the sacrifices that parents do; for instance, as it is implied in the poem, keeping the house warm and polishing the \\"good shoes\\". \\"When the rooms were warm, he‚Äôd call, and slowly I would rise and dress [...]\\" \\"[...]who had driven out the cold and polished my good shoes as well.\\" The poem reflects how Hayden's perspective of his father's love has changed, and his understanding of it has actually gotten deeper as the years have gone by; eventually the speaker starts to appreciate the selflessness of parental actions, while feeling a sense of regret for not having ever thanked him for he has done. Statue of the Good Shepherd The main symbol is temperature: Imageries such as \\"blueblack cold\\" make the reader aware of the cold temperature. However, soon in the poem, it becomes warm and words such as \\"fires blaze\\" enhance this image. The difference in temperature outside and inside the house reflects the author's relationship with his father. The image of cold also evokes solitude and emotional human distance. \\"from labor in the weekday weather made banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.\\" A small part of the poem is stated above, this summarises the main idea of the poem itself: the father works to keep the family safe and warm without expecting appreciation for it. Another symbol found in the poem is the symbol of the \\"good shoes\\". As the titles reminds the readers, it is a Sunday, a religious day. This shows how the father cares about his appearance like he cares about protecting his family. The author tells the readers that his father had \\"driven out the cold\\", an image which evokes a shepherd's behaviour with his herd. This can be linked to the idea of the Good Shepherd, thus creating a biblical reference. Analysis Those Winter Sundays contains 14 lines in 3 stanza. This makes it look like a typical Sonnet even though it isn't, it neither has a rhyme nor a regular iambic pentameter. The first line does not have a metrical pattern. In comparison, the second line is in a metrical pattern. Both lines are 10 syllables long. The third line is much shorter, and it does not have a rhyme. There is a repetition in line 13 \\"What did I know\\". Those Winter Sundays is a poem of discovery and definition. For example, it discovered the synchronicity of sound between certain words that remind the theme of reconciliation while reading it. Listening to the repetitive sound of the letter \\"K\\" in words like blueblack, cracked, ached, weekday, the reader can draw a melodic map of how to read the entire poem, connecting the fire, the season, the fire, and the son. Hayden also uses a metaphor, using the image of his father building the fire, that suggests the speaker finally discovered his father's love which he thought it never existed before. The speaker ends the poem with a rhetorical question by which he realizes his father's love towards him. This question changes the tone of the poem from nostalgic to regretful. Popular culture *The poem was the subject of the third episode of the first (and unique until now) season of Poetry in America with Elisa New (2018‚Äì ),produced by Verse Video Education that follow a storyline that is a plot summary and first aired on April 1, 2018 . The programme featured by an important person of the world panorama as the Vice President of the United States Joe Biden,and even by a renowned poet as Elizabeth Alexander (poet), Angela Duckworth, and working fathers and sons. This shows the international recognition of the work, and how it has the power to make readers travel to different eras in time, such as when industries were the main economic forces in 1960s America. * In 2009, Hayden's poem was included in the Poetry Foundation's DC Poetry Tour, a multimedia tour of Washington DC under leads poets point of view, through a collaboration lived in a fully way . *Those Winter Sundays was one of the poems which were celebrated at the Black History Month 2018 in February. It was celebrated with poems, podcasts and articles which are dealing with the African American history.

Built beginning in 1918, it was home to a maker of French worsted wool textiles, part of a major industrial development push in northern Rhode Island at the time. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. Description and history The former Andrews Mill Company Plant is located in North Smithfield's Branch Village, on the north side of Great Road (Rhode Island Route 146A) a short way east of the Route 146 highway. It is set on of land bordered on the north and east by the Branch River, a tributary of the Blackstone River. The complex has three historic buildings: the main weave shed, a connected boiler house, and a freestanding machine shop. The weave shed is a large building that is two stories in height, but presents a single story to the street, due to sloping terrain. The building is notable in part for its late-stage example of a sawtooth roof, a type that was eventually phased out with the advent of improved indoor lighting. There are several other later-20th century buildings on the site that are not historic. The site has seen industrial uses of some form since at least 1795, when the water power of the river was first harnessed for the manufacture of scythes. Its first use for textile production was about 1870, and a major textile works that operated there was destroyed by fire in 1915. It was purchased in 1918 by the Andrews Mill Company of Frankford, Pennsylvania, the American subsidiary of a French textile manufacturer. Its decision to locate there was based in part on the efforts of Aram Pothier, a French Canadian businessman and politician, and the presence in nearby Woonsocket of a large French-speaking working class. The mill operated only into the 1920s under this ownership, and was acquired by the Uxbridge Worsted Company in 1936. In 1955 it was leased to the Tupper Corporation, maker of Tupperware, which purchased it in 1958. Tupper shuttered the plant in 1994, after which it was used as a recycling plant. As of 2018, it has been vacant for some time.

Group of bonobos relaxing and grooming.Primate sociality is an area of primatology that aims to study the interactions between three main elements of a primate social network: the social organisation, the social structure and the mating system. The intersection of these three structures describe the socially complex behaviours and relationships occurring among adult males and females of a particular species. Cohesion and stability of groups are maintained through a confluence of factors, including: kinship, willingness to cooperate, frequency of agonistic behaviours, or varying intensities of dominance structures. Primate social organisation exists along a spectrum, with networks ranging from the solitary neighbourhood systems to the multi-individual units to the complex multilevel societies that are composed of hierarchically-organised social units. The evolution of diverse primate social systems is considered to be a naturally selected anti-predation response. Increased resource detection, cooperation and social learning are also considered as co-benefits of group living.  Emergence of group living  Similar to genetic traits, behavioural characteristics can similarly result from natural selection processes. In opposition to many animal-decision making strategies which encourage individual fitness, group living (or sociality) prioritises an inclusive group fitness. Socioecological factors are thought to influence primate social organisation. For example, the main benefits of group living are hypothesised to be: * Improved predator detection. Predator vigilance (or awareness) and predator defence are thought to increase with group living. More eyes means detection will occur sooner, communication among members will ensure appropriate responses and actions are taken, minimising the primates' susceptibility to predation. * Improved resource (water or food) detection. The hypothesis is that more individuals infer a heightened spatial knowledge and an increased ability to detect resources if more landscape is being covered. * Opportunity for cooperation. Primate sociality and living in close proximity bolsters cooperative behaviours necessary for participating in activities such as hunting, alloparenting, and/or territory or mate defence. * Reduced risk of infanticide. There have been observations from certain baboon populations that suggest a correlation between infant survival and group size: e.g. infants are likelier to survive in larger groups. * Increased opportunity for social learning. The main constraining factors of social group sizes are related to: * Resource abundance. Because living in groups requires members to share access to essential resources (like food, water, mates, sleeping sites) there are selective costs that constrain group size. * Pathogen transmission. Larger groups increases exposure to pathogens among its members. * Competition and aggression. If intra-group competition becomes too high, the associated stress can potentially impose negative health impacts. * Cognitive capabilities. There is an assumption that cognitive abilities must be able to interpret the complex information of group living (including information resulting from social relationships). Interestingly, there are competing hypotheses for the role feeding takes in influencing primate sociality. It is interpreted as having both as a positive (resource detection) and negative (resource competition) effect depending on the analysis. In order for sociality to have been selected for via natural selection, the collective benefits of group living must outweigh the collective costs. Thus, if intra- group competition becomes too great, the group is likely to fracture into smaller units. A thorough review of the literature suggests that the lower threshold of primate group living is determined by risk of predation while the upper limit of group size is determined by feeding competition among individuals.  Primate social organisation  Social organisation refers to the size (number of individuals), composition (variation between the sexes), and cohesion (relating to proximity and bond strengths among individuals) of the society in consideration. The synchronisation of individuals, or lack thereof, also provides insight into relationships among individuals. There are seven types of primate social organisations identified in the literature (discussed below), including: solitary primate systems, pair-bonded systems, one-male-multi-female systems, one-female-multi-male systems, multi-male- multi-female systems, fission fusion societies, and multilevel societies. Interestingly, primate social organisation is not necessarily species- specific. For instance, an example of within species (intra-species) variation would be tamarins and marmosets. These two primates are part of the callitrichidae family and have been observed to demonstrate pair-bonding systems in some populations while others have one-male unit (OMU) systems. Solitary female orangutan (Pongo) with her offspring. Solitary primate systems, sometimes referred to as neighbourhood systems, occur when an adult male's territory overlaps with one (or more) adult female's territory and individuals conduct activities (most often foraging or offspring care) independently from one another. In this system, solitary does not imply antisocial, but rather behaviour is characterised by this lack of synchronisation among the individuals. In fact, many solitary primates maintain social networks by using vocal or olfactory signals to communicate. Examples of solitary primates: orangutans, galagos, lorises, some species of lemurs, some tarsiers Lar gibbon (Hylobates lar) pair-bond. Pair-bonded systems, or pair-living primates, are small social units consisting of one adult male and one adult female, and their immature offspring. There are factors of time and space that define this type social system. Firstly, pair-bonds must demonstrate a long- term affiliative partnership for at least one year or one seasonal cycle. Secondly, there must also be a higher frequency of association (spatial proximity) between the bonded-pair individuals than there is with other individuals. Paternal care of offspring is a relatively uncommon trait in primate social systems; however, the monogamous mating system often observed (though it should not be assumed) in pair-bonding generates an equal variance for offspring success for both pair members. Thus, paternal involvement in off-spring rearing is much likelier to be observed in primate species where pair-living occurs. Examples of pair-bonded primate species: titi monkeys, owl monkeys, some species of marmosets and tamarins, many species of siamangs and gibbons Group of saddle-back tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis). One-female-multi-male groups are composed of one reproductive adult female and two or more adult male partners in the group. If there are other associated females within the group, they will likely have their reproductivity suppressed either via agonistic behaviours (aggressive and submissive interactions) or olfactory signals (such as pheromones). This social system promotes cooperative breeding (or alloparenting), where the non-breeding individuals assist in providing care for the off-spring produced by the main breeding female. Examples of one- female-multi-male structured primate species: many species of tamarin and marmoset Group of patas monkeys (Erthrocebus patas). One-male-multi-female groups are usually characterised by a single resident male who defends a group of (often related) adult females against males from outside the group. While tenure ship is held, this form of social organisation allows a male exclusive access to reproductive females for breeding purposes. A resident male often suffers challenges from extra-group males (perhaps belonging to all-male bachelor groups) whereby these males may attempt takeovers with the goal of gaining sole access to the reproductive females. A takeover by a new resident male could lead to infanticide (infant killing). This behaviour is interpreted as a strategic attempt to bring females back into estrous, which allows mating opportunities to occur sooner for the new resident male. Examples of one-male- multi-female structured primate species: some species of gorillas, numerous colobine and guenon species, patas monkeys, howler monkeys Multi-male-multi-female group of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur cata) Multi-male- multi-female social systems are characterised by associations between larger numbers of individuals forming groups. Since individuals are able to mate with multiple partners, paternity is often hidden or skewed which helps ensure the survival of off-spring. A variety of social relationships and bonds exist among multi-male-multi-female group members. For instance, some research has led to observations of dyadic relationships, or friendships. These friendships are more moderate forms of the pair-bonded social structures, existing within the multi-male-multi-female system. For instance, one study of savannah baboons (Papio cynocephalusI) observed that the lactating females in the group would more closely associate with specific adult males. As further research is conducted on primate friendships, three main benefits have been hypothesised: close associations with a specific male (1) tends to discourage infanticide, (2) tends to reduce incidence of harassment of the female, and (3) stimulates paternal investment and care in the offspring. The benefits of friendships within the multi-male-multi-female group systems demonstrate similar advantages as pair-bonded systems. Examples of multi-male-multi-female structured primate species: many species of macaques, baboons, vervet monkeys, mangabeys, capuchins, squirrel monkeys, woolly monkeys, some colobine species, some lemurs (ring-tailed and sifaka). Group of bonobos (Pan paniscus) Fission fusion societies demonstrate a high degree of fluidity by splitting (fission) and merging (fusion) as the group moves across a landscape. This type of organisation is less cohesive than multi-male-multi-female groups, with patterns often reflecting the local availability of resources. For instance, if foraging patch sizes are small, the larger group will often break apart to forage and later merge in order to sleep. This type of society is typically characterised by female philopatry, where female kin lineages make up the core of the groups and males disperse to other groups. Interestingly, some researchers hypothesise that fission fusion societies may have been socially inherited from the last shared common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees and bonobos. Examples of primate species with fission fusion societies: humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, spider monkeys Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus avunculus) Multilevel societies, sometimes referred to as hierarchical or modular societies, are the largest and most complex form of primate social organisation. Social stratification of these societies is discrete and has at least one stable core unit. Typically, multilevel societies are composed of between two and four levels of social structures: one-male units (OMUs, or harems) nested within clans, which are nested within bands, which are nested within a troop. OMUs are composed of a single-male breeding unit (a leader male), several females, and may even have a follower male. Similar to the resident male of a one-male-multi-female group, the OMU leader male is susceptible to takeovers by outside adult males. In some species, there is an additional level to the society: clans. The clan level is nested between the OMU and the band level. Clans consist of OMUs and of all-male units (AMUs) of bachelor males (either kin-related or not). Finally, a band is a coalesced grouping of OMUs who routinely sleep and forage together. The troop is a temporary aggregation of bands who might also forage or sleep in the same sites depending on environmental constraints. While multilevel societies might seem similar to fission fusion societies, they are not. Fission fusion societies have a dynamic element with routine variability whereas multilevel societies maintain stability through the hierarchy of core units. In order to fully understand how these complex societies function, it is important to observe social relationships and their interactions not only within tiers, but between them as well. Modular systems are considered to be an evolutionary construct resulting from the need to split up larger groups, whether they are large multi-male-multi-female groups or an amalgamation of closely related units. Examples of primate species with multilevel societies: hamadryas baboons, geladas, snub-nosed monkeys  Primate social structures  Primate social structures are meant to describe the diverse relationships that exist between individuals, as well as, the patterns of interactions that define them. Researchers hypothesise that environmental and social pressures have allowed for a whole array of inter-individual (between individuals) relationships that promote inclusive group fitness. Inter-individual relationships are thought to be influenced by sex-related variables and can occur (1) between females, (2) between males or (3) between members of the opposite sex. Factors influencing inter-female relationships are primarily thought to be: food competition; group size; and dispersal patterns. These three elements will characterise the degree of competition among female group members. For instance, in a female philopatric society there are often stable kin-based hierarchies that develop. Conversely, in male philopatric species or egalitarian societies, females regularly transfer between groups (eliminating the potential for hierarchies or coalitions) leading to female bonding as a sole mechanism for resource defence against other groups. Inter-male relationships tend to be characterised by agonism and competition over access to females. Socioecological theory predicts that fierce competition exists among male group members over access to females, leading to higher frequencies of agonistic interactions being common. Some species of primates demonstrate male-male relationships leading to alliances and affiliative behaviours when inclusive group fitness is being prioritised over individual fitness. Finally, intersexual relationships (between adult male and adult female individuals) are also shaped by a number of factors, including sexual selection, dispersal patterns, dominance structures, certainty of paternity, risk of infanticide and/or the level of sexual dimorphism that is present within a species. Affinity and affiliation between individuals is often largely determined by the dispersal patterns characterising a primate social system. For instance, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have patrilineal social systems, where the males usually remain in their natal groups and the females emigrate into neighbouring groups. Conversely, in the matrilineal societies of bonobos (Pan paniscus), it is the females who remain in their natal groups and the males who disperse to new groups. Dispersal patterns will also likely affect the structure or organisation of social hierarchies. thumb There are also affiliative behaviours which encourage stronger associations among individuals over time. Close proximity, grooming and non-aggressive social interactions are expected characteristics of well-bonded primates. Grooming is a multifunctional behaviour. Firstly, it is practical. Grooming allows the opportunity for unwanted dirt, dead skin, debris or ectoparasites to be removed from an individual's hair or fur. Moreover, it is a social activity. Grooming helps initiate new relationships and maintain existing ones; it can be used to deflate aggressive social interactions; and, it is beneficial to an individual's health since grooming has been linked to reductions in stress. Agonistic interactions, or agonism, refers to the frequency and degree of aggressive and submissive interactions occurring between individuals. The frequency at which individuals are being subjected to agonistic interactions could be related to factors such as rank (there is evidence of both high- and low-ranking individuals being targets of conspecific harassment) or dispersal patterns (non-resident individuals attempting to emigrate into other groups can often be at higher-risk of harassment from resident group members). Primate social systems and their organisation exist across a spectrum. While some systems reflect a strict dominance hierarchy, others are characterised by more egalitarian structures. A confluence of variables and behaviours, such as diet or dispersal patterns, are thought to shape social systems. Many forms of social hierarchies exist in primate systems. In resident-nepotistic intolerant hierarchies, the stable hierarchy is based on kinship and rank can be linearly traced, as it is inherited. In contrast, in resident-nepotistic-tolerant hierarchies, stability is maintained via inter-individual coalitions and tolerance by dominant individuals. In this system, power is not ultimate; it is partially mitigated by cooperation among subordinate individuals. Another form of dominance structure is related to age. For example, some gorillas demonstrate an age-graded dominance structure: wherein the eldest male member is the highest-ranking dominant male (or alpha).  Primate mating systems  Primate mating systems infer both a social element and a genetic element. Therefore, a mating system should describe: (1) the interactions and resulting relationship between the mating pairs involved; and (2) the reproductive outcomes from the mating system. For instance, monogamy infers exclusive mating access and, thus, greater paternity certainty. Observed mating systems in primates include: monogamy, polyandry, polygyny and polygamy (as described below). Monogamy, or a monogamous mating system, is when one adult male and one adult female have a preferential partner for copulation. There is a long- term temporal element to this category of mating system (longer than one year or one seasonal cycle) and offspring resulting from this mating system will belong to the pair. Additionally, there is an assumption that each member in this partnership have relatively equal likelihood for successfully reproducing. Though strict monogamy is rare in nature, some primate bonded pairs demonstrate monogamous (or partially monogamous) mating systems. In some monogamous pair-bonded species there have been observations of extra-pair copulations, wherein a male or female member and a partner of the opposite sex, other than the so-called mate, have been witnessed mating. Polyandry, or a polyandrous mating system, is when one reproductive adult female mates with two or more different adult males. In this mating system, the adult males mate exclusively with the adult female. Polygyny, or a polygynous mating system, is when one adult male mates with two or more adult females. It is the most commonly type of mating system in observed in primate studies. Polygyny can occur as a result of spatial constraints where solitary males are able to defend access to nearby solitary females. Another pattern reflects a scramble competition, wherein adult males roam the landscape in search of sexually receptive females, moving on shortly after mating. Harem-polygyny occurs when a single adult male defends access to multiple females in order to gain exclusive mating access. Finally, groups of males might form coalitions in order to successfully defend mating access to females. Polygamy, or a polygamous mating system, is when both males and females mate with two or more partners. In this mating system offspring paternity might remain unknown.

Capaldi was born in Leeds, England, and holds dual citizenship with the United States and the European Union. She attended the University of York and obtained a Bachelor of the Arts in Sociology in 1970. Capaldi continued her education at the University of Oregon, where she completed a Masters of Science in Industrial/Organizational Psychology in 1983 and a PhD in Developmental Psychology in 1991. Her dissertation, conducted under the supervision of Gerald Patterson, was titled The co-occurrence of conduct problems and depressive symptoms in early adolescent boys: A longitudinal study of general adjustment and familial factors. From 1983 to the present, Capaldi has worked as a scientist at the Oregon Social Learning Center where her research has been supported by grants from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  Research  Capaldi is known for her research on the developmental trajectories of youth, especially males, growing up under conditions of adversity due to poverty and family circumstances. Some of her most influential work has examined environmental factors, such as a history of parental transitions due to break- ups or divorce and ineffective parental monitoring practices, in relation to adjustment problems, antisocial conduct, deviant behavior, and depression in adolescent males. Her longitudinal research indicates considerable stability in both conduct problems and depressive symptoms of adolescent males. Capaldi is a senior scientist with the Oregon Youth Study, a longitudinal study of the etiology and life course of antisocial behaviors in males. The Oregon Youth Study focuses on men's relationships with their intimate partners and children. The study has documented over three generations the intergenerational transmission of parenting style, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and substance use. This longitudinal study also established associations between parental history of abuse and their own abusive behavior towards their children: A group of parents reported their experiences of abuse during childhood; ten years later, their adolescent male children reported their parents‚Äô abusive behavior towards them. The researchers found that parents who had experienced child abuse over multiple occasions were more likely to become abusive themselves. Capaldi and her colleagues have also studied factors associated with increased risk for dysfunctional romantic relationships in young adult males. Their longitudinal research identifies impulsive aggression and suicide attempts in adolescence as risk factors for later maladaptive relationship behaviors, such as physical and psychological aggression toward an intimate partner and domestic violence. Capaldi's research has also shown that a history of substance use problems, especially involving cannabis and hallucinogens, is predictive of increased risk of intimate partner violence among men. Other research has linked antisocial behavior, substance use, and low parental monitoring with heightened sexual risk behaviors, including increased numbers of intimate partners and contraction of sexually transmitted diseases.

Bullock is an American social psychologist. She is Professor of Psychology and Director of the Blum Center on Poverty, Social Enterprise, and Participatory Governance at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Bullock is known for her research on people's beliefs about economic disparities and the consequences of stereotypical beliefs about the poor on public policy. This includes work examining attributions about poverty made by news media, and how such attributions influence public support of welfare policies. Bullock participated in the APA Task Force on Socioeconomic Status in 2006 and served as the first Chair of the American Psychological Association (APA) Committee on Socioeconomic Status from 2007-2009. The Committee honored Bullock with its Distinguished Psychologist Leadership Award in 2013. With Bernice Lott, Bullock co-authored the book Psychology and Economic Injustice: Personal, Professional, and Political Intersections, which received the Distinguished Publication Award from the Association for Women in Psychology, and recognition from the American Library Association. Bullock is also author of Women and Poverty: Psychology, Public Policy, and Social Justice. In 2018, Bullock was appointed to serve on the APA Working Group on Deep Poverty, which aims to use psychological science to \\"challenge prejudicial attitudes and beliefs, inform policy and improve practice and programming... [ ] and move beyond current understandings of causes and consequences of poverty.\\"  Biography  Bullock received her B.A. from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. She went to graduate school at the University of Rhode Island where she obtained her Ph.D in Psychology in 1995 under the supervision of Bernice Lott. Bullock's dissertation examined attributions for poverty by asking middle class people and welfare recipients to explain poverty. Bullock has served as editor of the journal Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy. She was awarded the Iva Patterson Gilmore Prize in Psychology from Allegheny College in 1988.  Research  In Intersections of Ethnicity and Social Class in Provider Advice Regarding Reproductive Health, Bullock and her colleagues Roberta Downing, and Thomas A. LaVeist explored whether low income women experience stigma related to child bearing. They assessed whether low income women perceived their healthcare providers as advising them to limit the number of future children. They found that, in comparison to middle class white women, low income women of color and low income Latinas were at increased odds of being discouraged from having children. The findings demonstrate how ethnicity and social class may influence women's interactions with reproductive health care providers. In Media Images of the Poor, Bullock and her colleagues Karen Fraser Wyche, and Wendy R. Williams examined stereotypical images of the poor presented in mainstream media. They assessed the prevalence of such imagery as well as classist, racist and sexist imagery, and were particularly interested in whether media depictions of the poor changed after welfare reform in 1999. They determined that most articles expressed the obstacles welfare recipients and the poor faced with sympathy. They felt the media did not do a good enough job conceptualizing poverty, exploring its causes, and seeking solutions. Overall they felt the media presented economic inequality and poverty superficially and felt it was the media's responsibility to challenge beliefs about poverty and generate a movement towards welfare and social class reform.

Alabama, 586 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, barring cruel and unusual punishment. The case deals with whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits executing a person for a crime they do not remember. Background Vernon Madison shot police officer Julius Schulte twice in the back of the head in Mobile, Alabama in April 1985. Schulte was mediating a domestic disturbance between Madison and his ex-girlfriend; Madison also shot and injured her. Madison is an inmate at Holman Correctional Facility and has been since September 1985. Three trials were held, as the convictions from the first two were overturned: the first because prosecutors unconstitutionally excluded black people from the jury and the second because they introduced evidence improperly. In the third trial, the jury decided on a sentence of life in prison, but the judge Ferrill McRae overruled them and gave Madison a sentence of death in 1994. The execution was scheduled to occur in May 2016; the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay on the day of the execution, which the Supreme Court upheld 5-3 (at the time, one seat on the nine-member court was empty owing to Justice Antonin Scalia's death a few months prior). In Dunn v. Madison, in November 2017, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned a 2-1 decision by the 11th Circuit, which had stopped the execution on the basis that Madison \\"does not rationally understand the connection between his crime and his execution\\".Madison v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 851 F.3d 1173 (11th Cir. 2017); reversed sub. nom., Dunn v. Madison, 138 S. Ct. 9 (2017). The Circuit Court was overruling a state court decision that had denied Madison's petition on the basis that Supreme Court precedent only barred execution if he lacked \\"understanding he is being executed as punishment for a crime\\". The Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of the case, but ruled that the Circuit Court overstepped its authority under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which set the standard for which federal courts can overturn a lower court's decision. The execution was scheduled for January 2018; the Supreme Court granted a stay 30 minutes before Madison was scheduled to be executed, with Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissenting. Madison's health Madison had severe strokes in 2015 and 2016, resulting in vascular dementia and inability to remember killing police officer Schulte in 1985. Prior to his death, he was blind and had suffered a significant mental decline; he only remembered the alphabet up to the letter G and had slurred speech. The strokes caused physical damage as well, leaving him incontinent, unable to walk without a walker, and with slurred speech. However, according to the psychologist appointed by Alabama courts seeking his execution, he understood that he would be executed and the reason for that. On Saturday, February 22, 2020, Vernon Madison died while he was still on death row at Alabama's Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore. He was 69 years old. He was never executed. Officials did not cite a cause of death, but they did say that foul play was unlikely. News reports said shortly after his death that results of an autopsy were pending. Precedent In Ford v. Wainwright,. the Supreme Court held in 1986 that executing the insane is not allowed due to the Eight Amendment, and in Panetti v. Quarterman,. they held in 2007 that to be sentenced to death, an inmate must understand \\"the meaning and purpose of\\" his death sentence. Case The Supreme Court decided to hear the case in February 2018. Oral arguments were held on October 2, 2018. At oral argument, Alabama Deputy Attorney General Thomas Govan surprised some observers as well as Justices by agreeing with defense counsel Bryan Stevenson that dementia could be a form of incapacitation sufficient to meet the Ford and Panetti standards prohibiting the execution of some incapacitated inmates. Govan argued only that Madison's condition did not meet those tests because he still had the cognitive ability to understand why he was being executed, even if he could not recall the crime. Stevenson argued that Madison was disabled beyond solely memory loss and thus his execution would violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Decision In a 5-3 opinion, authored by Justice Kagan, the Court held that the Eighth Amendment may permit executing a prisoner even if he or she cannot remember committing his or her crime, but it may prohibit executing a prisoner who suffers from dementia or another disorder, rather than psychotic delusions. The Court held that if a prisoner is unable to rationally understand the reasons for his sentence, the Eighth Amendment forbids his execution. Justice Alito in dissent, joined by Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch, would not have reached this question, stating that Madison presented only the first question (whether a state can execute a prisoner who cannot remember committing his crime) in his petition. The Court remanded the case for the lower court to determine whether Madison was able to rationally understand the reasons for his sentence.

Morgenstern, who was a Jew, gained some importance in Hitler's research, since the good relationship he held with Hitler was sometimes taken as evidence that he was not yet an anti-Semite at that point.  Life and work  = Early years (1875 to 1911) = Morgenstern was born in 1875 as the son of Hungarian Jews in Budapest. In his youth he learned the craft of glassmaking, and served in the Austro-Hungarian Army for several years. Later Mogenstern moved to Vienna, where he opened in 1903 a glass shop with associated workshop. The store in the backyard of the house Liechensteinstra√üe No. 4 was conveniently located near the center of Vienna, which probably contributed to the rapid success of the company. In 1904 he married Emma Pragan (born 1871), the daughter of a Jewish family from Vienna. They had a son born in 1911. In the course of his professional career, Morgenstern achieved modest prosperity, so that he was able to gain a country estate in Strebersdorf near Vienna for the price of 5,000 crowns. In May 1914 he bought another piece of land at Gro√üjedlersdorf for 50,000 crowns. = Relationship with Adolf Hitler (1911/1912 to 1913) = Morgenstern stated in 1937 at the request of the main archive of the Nazi Party in Munich that Adolf Hitler first appeared in his Viennese shop in 1911 or 1912. Hitler's offer to include some of his pictures (especially watercolors) in Morgenstern's assortment was taken up by Glaser, who also sold picture frames. As a result, Hitler regularly supplied Morgenstern's business with his pictures until his emigration to Germany in May 1913. Morgenstern later said he bought them to fill empty frames that were for sale, attracting the customer's eye. The motifs of Hitler's paintings were mostly historical views in the style of Rudolf von Alt. Morgenstern also knew the Viennese lawyer Dr. Joseph Feingold. Feingold's wife, Elsa, n√©e Sch√§fer, liked the pictures, and he bought several for his apartment and law firm. After the invasion of the German Army, the pictures were picked up by the Gestapo. The Feingolds were arrested while fleeing to the Nice area, deported to Auschwitz via Drancy internment camp, and murdered. = Later life (1913‚Äì1943) = Morgenstern participated in the First World War as an officer of the Austro-Hungary's army on the Romanian front. After the war, when he was honored with two military diplomas for exemplary behavior, he returned to his old profession. After the annexation of Austria in March 1938, Morgenstern soon became the target of the anti-Semitic policy of the National Socialists. After the Kristallnacht, his business was closed by the authorities, and on 24 November 1938, it was \\"aryanized\\", i.e. Morgenstern was forced to sell it to an Aryan. However, the purchase price of 620 Reichsmark for workshop, shop and an extensive warehouse was never paid. Morgenstern was also deprived of his license to practice his trade; he was banned from working. In the following months, he depended on public generosity. Morgenstern wrote a letter to his former associate, Hitler, on 10 August 1939 addressed to \\"His Excellency the Chancellor and leader of the German Reich\\". It was apparently intercepted by bureaucrats as it has markings, such as underlines and \\"Jew!\\" added to the margin. In his letter, Morgenstern asked that the authorities, in exchange for the transfer of his landed property, pay compensation for the confiscation of his property (in foreign currency, so that he could emigrate). The letter went unanswered. Morgenstern could not leave the Nazi sphere of power because he could not afford travel expenses and the Reich Flight Tax. Shortly after the outbreak of World War II, the Morgensterns were expropriated and deported as Jews to the occupied Poland, where they were imprisoned in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto. There Samuel Morgenstern died of wasting in August 1943. He was buried in the ghetto cemetery. His wife, Emma, who, as her brother-in-law Wilhelm Abeles (who also lived in the ghetto and survived Auschwitz) witnessed her husband's death, was most likely deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp at the same month. Since it was a standard practice in Auschwitz to send most newcomers, especially old women unable to work, directly to the gas chambers, their death can be considered certain. Accordingly, a Viennese court ruled in December 1946 that they could not have survived to the end of the war and pronounced them dead, in agreement with a motion filed by their brother Max Pragan.Hamann: Hitler's Vienna.  Hitler's antisemitism  Some scholars argue that Hitler was not a pronounced anti-Semite during his time in Vienna (despite his enthusiastic Pan-German League attitude). As evidence for this, they state that young Hitler not only did business with Morgenstern, but also maintained a friendly relationship with him and his wife. For a while, he visited the two once a week as a guest in their home. This idea is supported by Hitler's good relationship with other Viennese Jews such as Jakob Altenberg or his cohabitants at the men's dormitory, Josef Neumann and Siegfried L√∂ffner, whom Hitler trusted more in business affairs than, for example, his petty criminal friend Reinhold Hanisch, a fervent anti-Semite. This behavior is in direct contradiction to Hitler's own claim in Mein Kampf, where he claims to have already been convinced in Vienna of the perishability of Judaism. However, researchers including Brigitte Hamann see Hitler's assertion in the light of his good relationship with Jews and the Morgenstern as a political statement purported to give the impression that his anti-Semitism developed in a straightforward line, and conceal changes in his thinking. That Morgenstern could have contributed in any way to provoke or nourish Hitler's prejudices or a bad image of \\"the Jew\\" can be considered as ruled out. Not only was Morgenstern the most important source of income for the young Hitler in the years around 1912, he also offered, as Peter Jahn of the main archive of the NSDAP still noted in 1937, good prices for Hitler's pictures. In addition, Hitler gave Jahn an appreciative statement in the 1930s that Morgenstern had been his \\"savior\\" during the Vienna period and had given him many important commissions.Sheree O.

She co-edited The Oxford Handbook of Counseling Psychology and the APA Handbook of Testing and Assessment in Psychology.  Biography  Hansen attended the University of Minnesota where she completed a B.A. in 1969, a M.A. in 1971, and a PhD in Psychology in 1974. Hansen received the E. K. Strong, Jr. Gold Medal Award in 1983 to honor her research contributions in the measurement of vocational interests, and the Exemplary Practices Award of the Association for Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development in 1986 and 1990. Hansen also received the Extended Research Award of the American Association of Counseling and Development in 1990 and American Counseling Association Research Award (with Sharon Sackett) in 1996. Prior to her retirement, Hansen was a member of the faculty in the area of Counseling Psychology at the University of Minnesota, where she served as Director of the Center for Interest Measurement Research. Hansen was an early advocate for the discipline of counseling psychology and served as Editor of the Journal of Counseling Psychology. She emphasized \\"...[ ] counseling psychology was one of the first areas within applied psychology to devote attention to issues of diversity, social action, and justice; this tradition continues with diversity broadly defined.\\" Hansen was involved in developing a long-standing partnership between the University of Minnesota's Vocational Assessment Clinic and a Neighborhood Involvement Program that provided mental health programs for the uninsured.  Research  Hansen's research explored vocational interests in relation to gender, cultural background, and personality with the goal of using the information to help people make career decisions. In graduate school, she worked with Charles Johansson in exploring vocational interests in relation to personality characteristics, such as dogmatism (i.e., rigid certainty about the correctness of one's views). In an early study (involving men only), high dogmatism was associated with interests in military, business, and management-related occupations while low dogmatism was associated with interest in arts. Hansen was involved in updating the Strong Interest Inventory, originally developed by Edward Kellog Strong Jr., as an assessment of vocational interests. The Strong Interest Inventory has been widely used to identify people's preferred activities as a means of helping them to find suitable careers. Originally called the Strong Vocational Interest Blank, the inventory had separate forms for men and women. In 1974, Hansen was part of the team that published a new version (called the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory) that combined the men's and women's inventories into a single form. With David P. Campbell and others, Hansen wrote the manual, user's guide, and applications and technical guide for the revised Strong Interest Inventory. Early in her career, Hansen aimed to relate John Holland's vocational model, which delineated six occupational themes (known as Holland codes), to women's responses on the Strong Interest Inventory. Notably, Hansen and her colleagues observed gender differences in the structure of interests using Holland's scheme, even when male and female participants were matched in occupational titles ‚Äì suggesting that the theoretical model may need some adjustments to better account for women's behavior. Hansen's later work confirmed the stability of the observed gender differences in interests using data conducted over a span of decades. Hansen collaborated with Thomas J. Bouchard and others on research exploring the vocational interests of twins, including some who had been reared apart due to adoption. This study aimed to estimate genetic and environmental effects on responses to the Strong Interest Inventory.  Representative Publications  * Hansen, J. I. C. (1987).

Role of the Prague Spring  By the early 1960s, Czechoslovak president and Communist Party head, Antonin Novotny, grew concerned that the military opposed increasing involvement in the Warsaw Pact. Accordingly, he moved to reorganize the CPA and reassign several generals. In 1965, Novotny reorganized the 1st Army into the Western Military District (Czechoslovakia), and the commander of the 1st Army, Lt. Gen Stanislav Prochazka, saw his power significantly reduced. Nonetheless, he initially earned the favor of the new president, Ludvik Svoboa, in 1968. When the Prague Spring uprising occurred under Alexander Dubcek, Svoboda initially sympathized with the protests. Prochazka then publicly expressed sympathy for the uprising as well. Additionally, Prochazka publicly expressed his opposition to Warsaw Pact intervention in Czechoslovakia's internal affairs. When Svoboda decided to support Warsaw Pact intervention and Soviet suzerainty over Czechoslovakia, General Prochazka was forced into early retirement and the 1st Army reformed again under General Karel Rusov.PARALLEL HISTORY PROJECT ON NATO AND THE WARSAW PACT (PHP): Oral History Interviews with Czechoslovak Generals: Soviet- Czechoslovak Military Planning in the Cold War.

The production process takes approximately eight years and results in a high alcohol concentration. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the specific use of certain body parts is capable of healing diseases according to the characteristics of the animal used to obtain the product, that is believed to be connected with the disease of the person. History In the Chinese culture, it was a tradition to use wines as a cure for diseases; this practice dates back to the Han dynasty's period of domination. The first reference to the specific involvement of tigers in the creation of the wine is around 500 AD. The demand for products containing animal body parts accelerated in the 1980s, during the process of industrialisation and the concomitant population increase: in this way, the booming of the middle class has led to more affordability to the purchase of these. The decreasing availability of tiger parts resulted in substantially higher prices, with bottles sold for hundreds of dollars each. In the 1990s, biologists and other researchers identified that the number of tigers used to make tiger bone wine (which were mainly from South China) had severely decreased. Traditional medicine's excessive demand for exotic-animal body parts is claimed to be a major factor in the tiger's current state of functional extinction. A tiger being fed in Thailand's Tiger Temple. Tiger wine production and commercialisation continued, although the ingredient of the animal has been omitted from the labels since then: the production of the tonic wine went on despite the ban on trading the animal components due to the existence of tiger farms together with legal shortcomings and few government regulations. In 1986, the first tiger farm was created in South China. This type of facility was classified as a zoo, until it was discovered that its actual function was to breed tigers like livestock. These facilities are managed so that tigers reproduce quickly, and newborns are removed from their mothers soon after birth so that the females can more quickly produce another cob. Tiger farms are located in China,Southeast Asia, and South Africa. In February 2018, these facilities were estimated to host more than 8,000 tigers, double the number in the wild. An investigation in Thailand led to the discovery of a disguised tiger farm with an income of about 3 million dollars a year. In a raid in 2016, Thai authorities seized the 137 tigers in a temple that lead to the discovery of tiger parts and 40 dead tiger cubs which were about to be used for wines and medical purposes. The consumption of tiger bone wine is believed to be limited mostly to the elder part of the population, since traditional medicine is being replaced by more modern, evidence-based medicine among younger people.  Geography  The concept of tiger bone wine originated in China, but its use has spread throughout Asia and worldwide. Although the tigers used to make wine were traded from various places, most countries' import and export operations have been disguised. Since 1992 China has continued to export tigers‚Äô bones to South Korea, as well as to India and Malaysia. Also European countries, such as Czech Republic, are believed to have contributed to the commerce of various parts of the animal in interest to Asia. The tigers used to make Tiger Bone Wine are taken from the farms. The farms are mostly allocated in China, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. Even if the trade of tigers to make health tonics is said to be furnished by indigenous tigers, many safari and wildlife parks used to promote that the tiger bone wine was produced by captive tigers. Examples of this are the Badaling Safari Park in Beijing (October, 2005) and a park in Shanghai, which also sold the wine. In 2007 the tiger breeding center in Heilongjiang was defined as another place where the wine was commercialised. In 2004, it was established a new factory, the Xiongsen Wine Producing Ltd. Co, in the Guilin-based Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village, where the wine was produced and sold. Typical ingredients The main component of tiger bone wine is tiger bones, which are crushed and then left to macerate for several years in a liqueur made from rice. For each of bones about of wine are obtained. Their price increases according to the period of ageing.214x214pxThe active ingredient per unit volume is fixed and, therefore, it may be used to control the therapeutic dose. In addition to the bones of the animal, other ingredients are: *rice wine (or white wine); *ginger; *sage. Two kinds of tiger bone wine are sold: the true one, made with the bones of tigers and other felines; and the common tiger bone wine, containing bones obtained from various other species, such as dogs, pigs, bears and horses. The cost of \\"common\\" tiger bone wine is significantly cheaper than a \\"true\\" one. =Variants= The original ingredients are often commonly substituted with herbs, similarly as in the case of the liniment Dit Da Jow: even in those cases, the beverage is still referred to as \\"tiger bone wine.\\" There are more than 200 variants, produced with angelica, licorice, scutellaria, and/or Ligusticum striatum (Â∑ùËäé chuƒÅnxi≈çng), which generally generate the same effects and reactions in those who use them. Goat blood, python meat, psoralen, cockroaches, bezoars, moss, rhinoceros horns, and Cordyceps sinensis are sometimes included in the beverage. Production The production has not changed over the past centuries, using the following steps: # After the skin and muscles are peeled off, bones and even entire skeletons arrive at the distillery where they are soaked several times in alcohol. # The bones are then removed and the remaining liquid is put into phials. # The phials are stored in batches to mature for a minimum of three years, before they are ready to be distributed. Tiger bone wine is easier to preserve in its bottle form and, being alcoholic, it may be stored for a long time without spoiling. Medical purposes In China, in accordance with the field of medical research, tiger bone cannot legally be used for testing after government authorization. It can be used as a beauty emollient. The calcium and protein found in tiger bones are said to have healing properties, and they are often used as an anti- inflammatory drug to treat: * rheumatism; * arthritis; * general weakness; * headaches; * stiffness or paralysis in lower back and legs; * dysentery. Apart from stimulating blood flow, the popular belief is that it is also considered to have properties that boost intelligence quotient and that increase virility in men. The \\"Compendium of Materia Medica\\" is a catalogue that was written over four hundreds years ago by the Chinese physician-scientist Li Shizhen. It credits tiger bones with driving off evil spirits, ghosts, and poisons; stopping convulsions; and treating acne. Controversy and conservation issues This product is packaged in tiger-shaped bottles. Examinations conducted by different NGOs, such as the Environmental Investigation Agency, have reported that several 'farms' are closely linked to the production and distribution of the liquor on the black markets. Around 1.800 tigers are kept in the tiger farms of Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village, in Guilin, in southwest China, in order to be used to produce as many as 200,000 bottles every year. In 2008, the U.K.-based Sunday Telegraph reported that undercover investigators had been offered the chance to buy wine made from the crushed bones of tigers at the Qinhuangdao Wildlife Park rescue centre in north China's Hebei Province, as well as at the Badaling safari park in Beijing. Starting from January 2017, as suggested by the former Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs of South Africa Edna Molewa, a dispatch of approximately 800 skeleton of lions coming from captive breeding will be sent in Asia in order to be used as a substitute of the traditional local tiger ingredients used. The trade in endangered species has been subject to international ban since 1987, and has been prohibited by the government since 1993, when China joined the Convention on Biological Diversity, previously opened for signature for the Earth Summit in 1992. From 29 October 2018, the commerce of both rhino horns and tiger bones has been legalised for scientific research and traditional medicine. According to the announcement, tiger parts have to be taken from farmed species, and can be used only in 'recognised structures by qualified doctors recognised by the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine'. This unpredictable decision has yet to be explained to the public, but experts believe that it can be considered as an economic move, due to the high value that the commerce of traditional Chinese medicine has on Asian markets. Other pictures In December 2011, an auction house based in Beijing auctioned about 400 bottles, in the guise of health tonics and liquors. The auction was interrupted due to the intervention of IFAW. Eventually, the Chinese government agreed to stop the sale of hundreds of bottles that were exposed at the auction.

Meyer Burger develops and produces systems with which solar cells can be manufactured and electrically connected for use in solar modules. The focus is on heterojunction technology (HJT) and the exclusive SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT). High-precision measuring systems for silicon wafers, solar cells and modules are also offered. From spring 2021, the company will produce solar cells and solar modules itself at two locations in Germany. Meyer Burger also develops and sells industrial inkjet, plasma and microwave systems, primarily for the semiconductor and optical industries, in other divisions and through subsidiaries.  History  The company was founded in 1953 as a manufacturer of watch stone processing machines and subsequently specialised in special sawing machines. In 1999, the company set up a holding structure with the foundation of Meyer & Burger Holding AG in Zug and launched the first band saw for the solar industry on the market in the same year. In the course of the growing solar industry, the company began to open up the Russian, Asian and American markets in 2003 and continued its expansion with the establishment of subsidiaries in China and Japan. In 2006, the Group was renamed Meyer & Burger Holding Ltd to Meyer Burger Technology Ltd and its headquarters moved to Baar. The company went public in November 2007. In 2012, the Group headquarters were relocated to Thun following the move into the new building. Between 2010 and 2012, the Group was significantly enlarged through various corporate takeovers in order to be able to cover the entire value chain (wafer - cell - module) in photovoltaic production with its own production machines. The most important products were diamond wire saws for cutting ultra-thin silicon wafers, coating systems to build functioning solar cells from wafers, and systems for the manufacture of complete solar modules. In the meantime, the corporate structure has been adapted and the focus has been placed on the areas of solar cell production and connection, i.e. on heterojunction cell coating and SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCTTM) for cell connection. In this context, the entire \\"Sawing and Cutting Technology\\" division was sold to Precision Surfacing Solutions in May 2019. While the company is still headquartered in Thun, Meyer Burger operates its main production site in Hohenstein-Ernstthal (Germany), where Meyer Burger acquired a majority stake in Roth & Rau in 2011. In 2019, Meyer Burger became the largest shareholder in Oxford Photovoltaics, a spin-off company from the University of Oxford in the field of perovskite photovoltaics and solar cells. The company has developed new solar cells that extract more energy from sunshine. Meyer Burger will also mass-produce their perovskite solar cells on silicon heterojunction (HJT) tandem cells, under a strategic and exclusive cooperation agreement. On 1 April 2020, the former Chief Technology Officer, Gunter Erfurt, took over the position of Group CEO. He was previously Managing Director of Meyer Burger Germany Ltd and previously managed the main production site in Hohenstein- Ernstthal.http://taiyangnews.info/people/meyer-burger-ceo-to-retire-as-cto- assumes-charge/ In June 2020, a change in strategy was announced, which will transform Meyer Burger into a technologically leading manufacturer of solar cells and solar modules. Initially, a production capacity of 400 megawatts per year is to be started at production facilities in Freiberg in Saxony and Bitterfeld-Wolfen in Saxony-Anhalt. By 2022 the capacities are to be expanded to 1.4 gigawatt cell and 0.8 gigawatt module production. In the long term, the production volume of 5 gigawatts per year is targeted. Meyer Burger manufactures the production facilities in Hohenstein-Ernstthal. The plan is to create up to 3,000 jobs. At an Extraordinary General Meeting on July 10, 2020, the shareholders approved the transformation of the company from a supplier to a module manufacturer and the associated capital increase. In this capital increase, just under 99 percent of the subscription rights were exercised, thus raising 165 million Swiss francs. Here, Sentis Capital has committed to assume 50 million Swiss Francs gross proceeds as backstop. The change in strategy followed a public debate between the Board of Directors, led by Remo L√ºtolf as Chairman and Hans Br√§ndle as CEO, and the shareholders, including Sentis Capital and Elysium Capital, which resulted in the election of shareholder representatives Mark Kerekes and Urs F√§hndrich to the Board of Directors.  Heterojunction & SmartWire Product  On May 11, 2020 Uwe Rau, German physicist and well-known photvoltaic scientist from Forschungszentrum J√ºlich confirmed in a radio interview in Germany‚Äòs largest federal state North Rhine-Wesphalia that Meyer Burger's new technology in photovoltaics can be compared to the technological step from 4G to 5G in mobile technology. In addition, he said that compared to standard modules from China, Meyer Burger's technology enables to generate more electricity using less space. According to a company investor presentation Meyer Burger Heterojunction Module efficiency reaches similar levels compared to High Efficiency IBC Technology of Sunpower and LG (chart p. 11). Also, Meyer Burger Heterojunction/SCWT enables three to ten times higher gross profit margins compared to mono-PERC (p. 18). This is a result of the much higher ASPs/wp (chart p. 11) for high efficiency modules with similar performance specifications and the already low production costs of Meyer Burger Heterojunction/SCWT which is nearing levels of Mono-PERC (chart p. 17). In addition, Meyer Burger HJT/SmartWire modules not only enable much higher gross profit margins but also compare very favorably on average selling prices (ASPs) compared to HJT competition. Furthermore, Meyer Burger HJT/SCWT offers the lowest possible LCOE, which is key purchase criterion for utility providers (p. 15). Moreover, HJT has some inherent advantages over PERC: higher efficiency with more power (Watt) per m2, higher energy yield (more kWh per installed kW) due to better temperature coefficient etc., less degradation over lifetime. Meyer Burger also states that while large-scale manufacturers achieved significant efficiency gains by implementing mono PERC and could decrease ASP advantage of existing HJT producers to only ~2 cts/Wp over time HJT could not reap the benefits of large-scale manufacturing so far. But the company adds that Meyer Burger's proprietary HJT/SmartWire offers substantial additional advantages even versus HJT competition, e.g. * additional reduction of degradation over lifetime due to proprietary technology and * additional power per m2. Therefore, an average selling price premium (ASP) of up to 12 cts/Wp for same LCOE of HJT/SmartWire vs PERC modules is estimated by Meyer Burger.  Corporate structure  In 2010 Meyer Burger merged with the previously independent company 3S Industries. The former competence centres of 3S Industries (3S Modultec, 3S Photovoltaics, Somont and Pasan) were and are since then business divisions of Meyer Burger. = Meyer Burger (Germany) GmbH = Roth & Rau was renamed Meyer Burger (Germany) in 2014. The company develops and produces various systems and machines for surface treatment in the photovoltaic industry and played a key role in the industrialization of the so-called PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact) technology, which represents the current standard in solar cell production. The company also develops and builds mass production systems for the manufacture of highly efficient solar cells using heterojunction technology (HJT). = Pasan SA = In the course of the merger with 3S Industries, Pasan became part of Meyer Burger in 2010. The company focuses on the development and manufacture of test and measurement systems for solar cells and modules. These include solar simulators, which are used by leading international certification bodies and numerous cell and module manufacturers thanks to their high accuracy and reliability. The company is headquartered in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland. = Oxford Photovoltaics Ltd. = In 2019, Meyer Burger became the largest shareholder in Oxford Photovoltaics, a spin-off company from the University of Oxford in the field of perovskite photovoltaics and solar cells. The company has developed new solar cells that extract more energy from sunshine. Meyer Burger will also mass-produce perovskite solar cells on silicon heterojunction (HJT) tandem cells as part of a strategic and exclusive cooperation agreement.  Former divisions  = Meyer Burger AG (MB Wafertec) = With the development and production of cutting and sawing systems for the solar industry, Meyer Burger's rapid growth began in 2000. The diamond wire cutting technology used today in the PV industry was primarily developed by Meyer Burger and industrialized for mass production. The entire \\"Sawing and Cutting Technology\\" division was sold to Precision Surfacing Solutions (PSS) at the end of April 2019 for CHF 50 million. = 3S Solar Plus AG = The company 3S Industries with the divisions 3S Modultec and 3S Photovoltaics among others merged with Meyer Burger in 2010 and was initially continued as the 3S Photovoltaics division. Subsequently, the two brands 3S Modultec and Solar Building Technologies were created. This division developed and produced building-integrated solar systems. The frameless solar modules of the MegaSlate brand contain solar cells between two glass layers. As a result, the modules have the same properties as laminated safety glass and can be used directly as a building housing, replacing roofing with roof tiles. The division was later integrated into the \\"Energy Systems\\" business unit of Meyer Burger and in 2018 outsourced to the separate company 3S Solar Plus AG and sold. = AIS Automation Dresden GmbH = Until 2019, AIS Automation Dresden GmbH also belonged to the Meyer Burger Group. As a system and software company, AIS has been developing software solutions in the field of automation technology and information technology since 1990. It acts as a full-service provider from the conception to the realization and installation of the system on site. The business areas include plant and system controls, factory automation, system integration and railway technology. At the end of 2019, the system was sold to S&T; AG in Linz (Austria). = Meyer Burger (Netherlands) B.V. = As part of the takeover of Roth & Rau AG in 2011, Roth & Rau Netherlands B.V. (formerly OTB Solar) in Eindhoven (Netherlands), which had belonged to the Roth & Rau Group since 2010, also became part of the Meyer Burger Group. They develop and build systems for industrial inkjet printing under the PiXDRO brand. The system size ranges from compact printers for the research sector to mass production systems for various applications and industries (e.g. printed electronics, displays, OLEDs, sensors, printed circuit boards, semiconductor assembly, etching techniques, photovoltaics, optics, life sciences). Meyer Burger (Netherlands) B.V. was sold in December 2019. = Muegge GmbH = As part of the takeover of Roth & Rau AG in 2011, Muegge GmbH in Reichelsheim (Germany), which had belonged to the Roth & Rau Group since 2008, also became part of the Meyer Burger Group. Muegge is one of the world's leading suppliers of industrial microwaves and plasma systems. Its portfolio includes microwave generators and components as well as plasma systems for a wide variety of applications in various industries such as the semiconductor industry, OLED and MEMS production and medical technology. Muegge GmbH was sold in August 2020 as Meyer Burger moves form being an equipment provider to a major European supplier of solar cells and panels. The transaction provides a cash inflow of 24 million Swiss Frans and book profit of 4 million Swiss Francs.

Other  On May 6, 2020, Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt suggested to think about constructing a gigantic solar park in the Hambach open-pit coal mine in North Rhine-Westphalia.This would generate electricity with a capacity of around ten gigawatts, which would roughly correspond to the capacity of the Weisweiler, Neurath, Niederaussem and Frimmersdorf coal-fired power plants, which are currently dependent on the open-pit mines. Considerations for a later use of the gigantic area with an area of 50 square kilometres include flooding to form a lake landscape. According to Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt, it would be conceivable to cover Lake Hambach with solar modules. Up to 50 million solar modules with a capacity of 10 gigawatts could be installed as a floating solar park, as has already been realised in other parts of the world. According to Meyer Burger CEO Gunter Erfurt the construction of a state-of-the-art plant for cell and module production in Germany is currently being evaluated. German physicist Uwe Rau confirmed that such a project is feasible and that a major advantage of the Hambach open-pit coal mine is that power transmission lines are already in place and can be used because of the power plants. RWE Power AG announced in May 2020 that photovoltaic projects for the Sophienh√∂he are conceivable. Andreas Pinkwart, Minister for Economic Affairs, Innovation, Digitisation and Energy of North Rhine-Westphalia, also expressed his support for the project.

She is likely to have attended Adam Mahrburg's lectures in the 1890s. From 1897 to 1899 she studied at the University of Berlin. Financial considerations forced her to return to Warsaw and work as a home tutor again from 1897 to 1807: she translated works by Richard Avenarius and Ferdinand T√∂nnies into Polish. From 1907 to 1909 she studied at the University of Zurich, encountering the work of Eugen Bleuler and Carl Jung. She gained a doctorate under Friedrich Schumann with a thesis on stereoscopic vision, 'Experimental Contributions to Analysis of Depth Vision'. Returning to Warsaw, Karpi≈Ñska defended Freudian psychoanalysis at the first Congress of Polish Neurologists, Psychiatrists and Psychologists, where a presentation by Ludwig Jekels provoked \\"violent debate\\". In 1909-10 she and Jekels attended four gatherings of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society: her criticisms of the society's ignorance of philosophy caused Freud to refer to her as a \\"Polish lady philosopher\\". Karpi≈Ñska herself underwent psychoanalysis with an unknown German psychoanalyst. After continuing to support herself as a home tutor in Warsaw, she relocated to Zakopane in 1911, possibly for health reasons. During the war she joined the Polish Legions as a nurse. She married Marcin Wyczynski, a doctor specializing in pulmonary disease. In May 1920 Ludwika Karpi≈Ñska-Woyczy≈Ñska became director of the Municipal Psychological Lab in Lodz, where she worked on the psychological testing of children and young people. Her husband became personal physician to J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, and the couple accompanied him on a 1931 holiday trip to Egypt. However in 1935 Pi≈Çsudski became suspicious that Karpi≈Ñska-Woyczy≈Ñska was a Communist spy, and had her arrested and interrogated for several weeks at Pawiak prison. No evidence was found.

He has worked as a painter, draftsman, collage artist, sculptor and graphic artist.  Style and work  From 1951 onwards, Guy Vandenbranden said goodbye to figuration and started to work lyrically abstract. In 1952, Vandenbranden ended up in the Brussels art scene and became friends with Pol Bury, Jo Delahaut, Kurt Lewy, Jean Rets and Jean Milo. Thanks to these contacts, Guy Vandenbranden joined the artists' group \\"Art Abstrait\\" in 1956. Vandenbranden worked completely geometrically abstract from 1954 on and practiced this visual language consistently until his death in 2014. Around 1958, Vandenbranden worked mainly in black and white, his artworks almost coming to monochromy and there was a clear connection with the work of the American Hard Edge of that time. From 1961, Vandenbranden started working with relief and his first abstract sculptures were created. From 1967 onwards Guy Vandenbranden started to spray cellulose lacquer directly on panels with the aim to create visual illusions (akin to the Op Art).  New Flemish School  In 1959, Vandenbranden and Jef Verheyen planned to open an Antwerp avant- garde gallery to bring together artists with a like-minded spirit. Piero Manzoni, Jean Tinguely and Lucio Fontana had pledged to work together, but in the end this project jumped and G58 took the role as platform for a new (European) avant-garde at the Hessenhuis in Antwerp.David Vermeiren, 'Guy Vandenbranden. Een abstract leven', Antwerpen, Callewaert Vanlangendonck Gallery, 2014, pg. 13 After their project ended, Vandenbranden and Jef Verheyen forged plans with Englebert Van Anderlecht to the establishment of the New Flemish School in 1960. This artists' group, including Paul Van Hoeydonck, Jan Dries and Vic Gentils, aimed to promote their art internationally with exhibitions in Germany, Switzerland and Italy.

Studies have shown that while the lenses alter the perception of already perceived colors, they do not restore normal color vision, and claims in excess of this by the manufacturer have been characterized as marketing hype.  History  Glass scientist Donald McPherson invented EnChroma glasses by accident. He originally was trying to develop lenses to protect and aid surgeons during laser operations.  Technology  thumb The lenses focus on the most common color vision deficiency which is caused by the red and green retinal cone cells that, when responding to light, coincide. To eliminate the overlapping of the wavelengths of light, there is an optical material called a 'multi-notch' filter, which is capable of removing the exact wavelengths of light in the location where it overlaps, getting a simplified differentiation of colors. The glasses block specific wavelengths to create a clearer separation of different color signals so that they can be better calculated by the brain. The separation of signals allows most people with color blindness to distinguish colors, but the glasses will have little to no effect on the 20% of color blind people who have severe color impairment.  Scientific analysis  A study involving 23 males aged from 20 to 25 years with normal trichromatic color vision showed that Enchroma Cx-14 lens notches the blue and violet region of the visible spectrum. This induced participants with normal color vision to experience tritan defect when wearing the lens. In a subsequent study involving ten individuals with hereditary deficiencies (nine males and one female from age 19 to 52), the EnChroma Cx-14 filters did not significantly influence the vision of color blind subjects and \\"improved the error score in only two subjects\\". In 2018, a study of EnChroma lenses proved that they merely helped color blind people to see the same colors in a different way since the colored filter altered the way colors appeared in their eyes. The researchers found the effect of using EnChroma glasses is similar to glasses where the use of color filters changes the user's perception and increases the contrast among the colors, such as those used for shooting or hunting. The research showed that EnChroma glasses did not reveal any improvement in the Ishihara test and Farnsworth‚ÄìMunsell 100 hue test. A November 2018 article published by Skeptical Science, detailed the studies performed to date on EnChroma glasses. The article stated that, The article concluded that \\"the magic glasses did not deliver on the promises\\". And discussing the manufacturer's claims for the lenses vs the science regarding color deficient vision, the report answered the question, \\"How could they possibly work?\\", as follows: \\"The answer is that they can‚Äôt\\".

Her cover name within the Siegl resistance group was \\"Walli\\". She was executed, along with two of her resistance comrades, by guillotine at the district court complex in Vienna on 23 September 1943.  Biography  Katharina \\"K√§the\\" Wanek was born at Hulken, a small and ancient South Moravian town about 100 miles (160 km) to the north-east of Vienna, and which since 1993 has been in the extreme south- east of the Czech Republic. She was youngest of the six children of the farm workers Franz and Maria Wanek. The family relocated to Vienna in 1905. She attended the junior school in the Favoriten quarter on the southern side of the city for six years and then undertook a succession \\"assistant\\" jobs. In 1921 she married Franz Odwody, a machinist-assistant five years older than she. He emigrated to America in 1922 but returned to Vienna in 1924. That year K√§the was recruited to work at the \\"Ankerbot\\" bakery, Austria's leading industrial bakery, where she worked till 1934, also serving on the factory's works council. She was active as a member of the Austrian Free Trades Union of Food and Drink Workers between 1923 and 1934. The \\"Ankerbot\\" bakery was well known as a centre of labour activism. Back in 1918 employees had created a \\"workers' army\\" of around 1,000 men to protect the factory: this ad hoc militia had at that time been one of the largest quasi-military organisations in Vienna. During the short-lived (and brutally suppressed) insurrection in February 1934 the factory became a centre for the anti-government protection league and other socialist resistance groups. Workers responded to the strike call of the trades union movement and many were involved in armed street fighting against forces backing the post-democratic Dollfu√ü r√©gime. The protection league member Alexander Scheck, whose shooting by government forces on 13 February 1934 marked the collapse of the resistance, was an \\"Ankerbot\\" worker. K√§the Odwody herself was among the Ankerbrot workers arrested in the aftermath of the street fighting. She was held in custody between 17 February and 11 May 1934. It was only a few weeks after her release, on 14 June 1934, that she was charged at the Vienna district court with \\"Insurrection and High Treason\\" (\\"Aufstand und Hochverrat\\"). She was acquitted. However, the court also dismissed her claim for compensation because the \\"suspicion that she had participated in the disturbances\\" had not been sufficiently invalidated. The indictment against her had alleged that during the days of fighting she had loaded up the gun belts of the fighters with cartridges in the canteen used by the bakery \\"coachmen\\" (delivery drivers). Despite her acquittal she lost her job with the bakery and remained unemployed till 1938. In March 1938 Fascist Austria was formally incorporated into an enlarged Nazi Germany following a largely unresisted military invasion from the north-west. That year K√§the Odwody returned to her job at the \\"Ankerbot\\" bakery. It was also that year that the factory owners, the Mendl family, whom the authorities had identified as Jewish, escaped to Switzerland. The factory was expropriated by the authorities and \\"aryanised\\" but it remained a focus of trades union activism. At the start of 1939 a strike took place at the factory against the equalisation of payroll taxes (which before 1938 had been much higher in Germany than in Austria). There had been no compensating wage increase at the bakery to compensate. The Gestapo crushed the strike and intensified their surveillance and supervision activities at the plant. Odwody reacted by joining the (since 1933 illegal) Communist Party. In Autumn 1940 she was accepted into the local leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for the Favoriten district of Vienna, which was still her home. She became a party official and contributed to party work by collecting membership subscriptions and secretly distributing Die Rote Fahne (\\"Red Flag\\"), the party newspaper. She became a member of the so-called \\"Siegl Group\\", a resistance group which took its name from the cover name used by its leader, Rudolf Fischer. Odwody's own cover name in the group was \\"Walli\\". Rudolf and Maria Fischer were arrested on 29 April 1941. Franz and K√§the Odwody were arrested the same day. Franz was suspected of having collaborated with his wife in respect of her resistance activities. He was nevertheless released on 17 May 1941. His wife remained in state custody. Rudolf and Maria Fischer were executed at the district court complex on 28 January 1943 and 30 March 1943. K√§the Odwody finally faced the special people's court in Vienna on 9 November 1942. The charge was the usual one under these circumstances of \\"preparing to commit High Treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). She was convicted and sentenced to death. Like her comrades the Fischers she was executed on the guillotine which the authorities had installed at the district court complex in 1938, shortly after the annexation of Austria. K√§the Odwody's execution took place on 23 September 1943.

Unlike the U.S. Open and USBC Masters, which allow qualifying amateurs to participate, the PBA Players Championship is open to PBA members only. Tournament history The tournament began as the PBA Touring Players Championship in 1983 and ran every PBA Tour season through 2000. There were no Players Championship events under any name from 2001 to 2010. After the tournament returned to major status in the 2016 season, the PBA voted to retroactively award major titles to the winners of the three previous Players Championship events that decade (2011, 2013, 2015), stating the tournament \\"is a members-only event, and includes all of the elements of a major.\\" The current tournament includes a maximum starting field of 92 PBA players. The top PBA members in earnings from the previous season have entry priority over the general membership, and can fill up to 82 spots. The remaining 10 spots in the starting field are filled from a ten-game pre-tournament qualifier (PTQ). The tournament format has changed over the years. The current format includes 42 games of qualifying: three rounds of six games each to determine the top 24 for match play, followed by three match play rounds of eight games each. All pins from the initial 18 games carry over into the match play round, with the match play rounds adding 30 bonus pins per victory to the total pinfall in the round. The field is then cut to the top five for the televised stepladder finals. There is no set oil pattern. The 2018 Players Championship used the 44-foot Carmen Salvino oil pattern, while the 2019 event used the 45-foot Dragon pattern. The 2020 event featured the 38-foot Wayne Webb oil pattern, named after the PBA Hall of Famer whose bowling center in Columbus, Ohio has hosted this tournament since 2016.

She is Professor of Psychological Sciences at the University of Connecticut. Pratto is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science. Pratto is co-author, with Jim Sidanius, of Social dominance: An intergroup theory of social hierarchy and oppression. This book describes how societies are structured through group-based social hierarchies, and how societal structures lead to intergroup conflict, racism, classism, and patriarchy.  Biography  Pratto grew up in Boulder, CO. She received her BA at Carnegie Mellon University in 1983, where she conducted research with Susan Fiske on people's conceptions about nuclear war. She continued her education at New York University where she received her Master of Arts degree in 1987 and her Ph.D in Psychology in 1988. Pratto was an Associate Professor of Psychology at Stanford University from 1990-1997 prior to joining the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Connecticut.  Research  Pratto has studied the processes and consequences of inequality, encompassing race and sex discrimination in hiring and workplace environments, prejudice against the LGBTQ community and immigrants, violations of International Humanitarian Law in war-time, terrorism and counter-terrorism, and the Arab uprisings. Pratto and her colleagues received the Morton Deutsch Conflict Resolution Award in 2008 for their co-authored paper \\"Power Dynamics in an Experimental Game\\" published in Social Justice Research. Their study examined relational and structural aspects of power dynamics and the emergence of inequalities as pairs of students played an interactive game. Pratto was part of the research team awarded the Gordon Allport prize in 2011 for their co-authored paper \\"Diversity policy, social dominance, and intergroup relations: Predicting prejudice in changing social and political contexts\\" published in Social Justice Research. This multinational study examined anti-Muslim prejudice across countries varying in social norms related to multiculturalism and assimilation. In another multinational study, Pratto and her colleagues were awarded the Otto Klineberg Intercultural and Intergroup Relations Award in 2015 for their coauthored paper ‚ÄúInternational support for the Arab uprisings: Understanding sympathetic collective action using theories of social dominance and social identity.\\" This study used social identity theory and social dominance theory to account for sympathetic collective actions observed throughout the world in response to the Arab Spring. Pratto uses a variety of research methods, from international surveys and comparative studies to interactive games in the laboratory and field experiments. In collaboration with Oliver John, Pratto examined cognitive processes that direct attention towards negative stimuli that have the potential to adversely impact one's well-being. Her research with Peter Hegarty focused on social constructionism and group differences, with relevance to feminist psychology and lesbian and gay psychology.

Gregor von Bochmann, 2016  Biography Gregor von Bochmann grew up in an artistic family, two of his great-grandfathers being well-known painters (Gregor von Bochmann and Hans Peter Feddersen). From 1952 to 1961, he attended the Johann-Heinrich-Vo√ü- Gymnasium in Eutin. Then he studied physics at the universities of Kiel, T√ºbingen, Grenoble (France) and M√ºnchen. In between, he studied for one year cello and piano at the Musikhochschule L√ºbeck. He completed his master's in 1968 with a thesis about his participation in the second muon g-2 experiment at CERN. Then he moved to Canada and completed his PhD in 1971 at McGill University in the field of theoretical high-energy physics. With programming experience in machine, assembler and high-level languages obtained during his work on the master and PhD theses, he used a post-doctoral scholarship from the National Research Council of Canada to get familiar with certain fields of computer science. 1972 he became assistant professor in the computer science department of the Universit√© de Montr√©al. His first research topic in computer science was related to neural networks. But soon he moved to the field of compiler construction, and wrote a paper on the description of the semantics of programming languages which was much cited. But in 1975 he moved to the very new field of computer networks and concentrated his efforts on the description, verification and implementation of communication protocols. He wrote a seminal paper on finite state description of protocols and proposed the approach of reachability analysis for the verification of the behavior of distributed systems. He participated also, in the name of the Canadian government, in the international standardization activities on \\"Formal Description Techniques for communication protocols and services\\" that took place in ISO and ITU during the 1980s. He spent a sabbatical year in 1979-80 at Stanford University and in 1986-87 with Siemens in M√ºnchen. From 1989 to 1997, he held the \\"Industrial Research Chair\\" on testing communication protocols at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. He was also a scientific director of the from 1990 to 1997. During this period, he organized many collaborative research projects with industry and university colleagues. In 1998 he moved to the University of Ottawa where he was full professor until 2016. During this time, his research covered several areas, such as software engineering for distributed systems, distributed multimedia applications, peer-to-peer systems, control procedures for optical networks, and Internet security.

It was the parent unit for a number of batteries in the later Territorial Force, including heavy batteries of the Royal Garrison Artillery that fought on the Western Front during World War I. It later formed a heavy regiment that served in the Battle of France and the campaign in North West Europe during World War II, while a spin-off medium regiment fought in Sicily and Italy. Its successor units continued in the postwar Territorial Army until the 1960s. Volunteers The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular Royal Artillery in time of need.Beckett.Grierson, pp. 1‚Äì12.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 1‚Äì4.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. The 1st Edinburgh (City) Artillery Volunteer Corps was raised in the City of Edinburgh on 4 November 1859. Its members were mainly artists, and the first commanding officer (CO) was Captain Joseph (later Sir Joseph) Noel Paton, the illustrator and sculptor, with the painter John Faed as lieutenant. By October 1860, the unit had a strength of nine batteries:Beckett, Appendix VIII.Grierson, pp. 128‚Äì30.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 62‚Äì5. * No 1 Battery, raised 4 November 1859 * No 2 Battery, raised 10 January 1860 * No 3 Battery, raised 28 January 1860 * No 4 Battery, raised 6 March 1860 * No 5 Battery, raised 24 March 1860 * No 6 Battery, raised 23 May 1860 * No 7 Battery, raised 6 June 1860 * No 8 Battery, raised 13 August 1860 * No 9 Battery, raised 16 October 1860 The 2nd and 4th Batteries were mainly composed of artisans, but the members of the other batteries paid for their own uniforms and equipment. The unit's badges and accoutrements bore the inscription 'EDINBURGH CITY ARTILLERY'. Its headquarters (HQ) was established at 21 Castle Street (later at King's Stables Road, and then 28 York Place), Edinburgh, and it used the Argyle Battery (12-pounder guns) at Edinburgh Castle for drill. It carried out firing practice at a 32-pounder battery at Leith Fort, and for Carbine practice it used the Queen's Edinburgh Rifles' range at Hunter's Bog in Holyrood Park.Army List, various dates. Once the unit reached full size, a retired professional officer, William M.G.M. Wellwood (formerly Captain in the 2nd Bengal Light Cavalry), was appointed CO with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on 13 September 1860. He was succeeded by Thomas Bell on 4 April 1864, and then in turn by Sir William Baillie, 2nd Baronet, on 6 December 1866. Baillie remained in command until 1884. From 1864, the 1st and 2nd Berwickshire AVCs were attached to the Edinburgh City Artillery. The 1st had been raised at Eyemouth on 6 April 1860, and the 2nd at Coldingham appeared in the Army List in February 1861 but no officers were commissioned into it until 10 July 1863.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 32. The 2nd Berwickshire AVC was disbanded in 1883. 16-Pounder RML gun manned by Artillery Volunteers. The AVCs were intended to serve as garrison artillery manning fixed defences, but a number of the early units manned semi- mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. However, the War Office (WO) refused to pay for the upkeep of field guns and the concept died out in the 1870s. It was revived in 1888 when some Volunteer batteries were reorganised as 'position artillery' to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. In February 1889, the 1st Edinburgh AVC was issued with two position batteries of 16-pounder Rifled Muzzle-Loading guns, which were manned by four of the garrison batteries. In 1892, the two position batteries were numbered 1 and 2, and the remaining garrison batteries were redesignated Nos 3‚Äì7 Companies. The 16-pounders were replaced by 4.7-inch breechloading guns in February 1903, and position batteries were officially referred to as 'heavy' batteries from 1902.Beckett, pp. 178‚Äì9.Litchfield and Westlake, p. 6. From 1 April 1882, the unit formed part of the Scottish Division of the Royal Artillery (RA); on 1 July 1889, the Volunteer artillery were regrouped into three large divisions, the 1st Edinburgh being assigned to the Southern Division. In 1899, the artillery Volunteers were transferred to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA), the Edinburgh unit becoming the 1st Edinburgh (City) RGA (V) with the 1st Berwickshire RGA (V) still attached.Litchfield and Westlake, pp. 3‚Äì6. By the early 20th Century the unit carried out its gun practice from the Inchkeith Batteries. In 1907, the unit's detachment won the King's Prize at the National Artillery Association meeting at Lydd. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the personnel of the Edinburgh City Artillery was distributed to several new units:London Gazette 20 March 1908.Litchfield, pp. 295‚Äì8. * The Lowland (City of Edinburgh) RGA * Some personnel merged with parts of the 1st Argyll RGA and the 1st Renfrewshire RGA to form the Forth & Clyde RGA, a coast defence unit based at Edinburgh * The 1st (City of Edinburgh) Battery was formed in the 1st Lowland Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, the rest of which came from the 1st Midlothian RGA * Members of Edinburgh University who had served in Left Half, 1st Heavy Battery, transferred to the Edinburgh University contingent of the Senior Division of the Officers' Training Corps (OTC) * 1st Berwickshire RGA (V) was disbanded Subsequently, the Lowland (City of Edinburgh) RGA became the Lowland (City of Edinburgh) Heavy Battery, RGA, based at McDonald Road, Edinburgh, with its own ammunition column.Lothians at Great War Centenary Drill Halls. It formed part of the Lowland Division of the TF.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 111‚Äì4.Conrad, 1914.52 Div at Long, Long Trail. World War I =Mobilisation= On the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, the Lowland Hvy Bty began mobilising at Edinburgh with its four 4.7-inch guns, under the command of Major J.B. Cameron.RGA (TF) at Regimental Warpath. Almost immediately, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the WO issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form them into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. The 2/1st Lowland (City of Edinburgh) battery was formed in the 2nd Lowland Division.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 64‚Äì5.65 Div at Long, Long Trail. =1/1st Lowland (City of Edinburgh) Heavy Battery= The battery and ammunition column completed mobilisation on 14 August and moved out to its war station at Stirling in the Scottish Coastal Defences the following day. When the Lowland Division (numbered as the 52nd (Lowland) Division) embarked for the Gallipoli Campaign in May and June 1915, its heavy battery remained training in Scotland. It moved from Stirling to Cupar on 25 October, then on 26 January 1916 it moved south to the RA depot at Woolwich to prepare for overseas service.MacDonald, Offensive Spirit, pp. 199‚Äì20.MacDonald, Pro Patria, pp. 178‚Äì9. 1/1st Lowland Hvy Bty was sent to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, disembarking at Le Havre in France on 16 February. Two days later, it joined XVII Brigade, RGA, at Authie.'Allocation of Heavy Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/2. The RGA brigades were renamed Heavy Artillery Groups (HAGs) shortly afterwards, and the policy was move batteries between HAGs as required. 1/1st Lowland Hvy Bty moved to 16th HAG on 3 March, then to 48th HAG on 17 April.Farndale, Western Front, Annex E. Gommecourt Somme. 48th Heavy Artillery Group was assigned to support VII Corps' Attack on the Gommecourt Salient in the forthcoming 'Big Push' (the Battle of the Somme). The battery was ordered to Berles-au-Bois north of Gommecourt at the beginning of May and spent a week preparing positions for its guns. It was then ordered to hand these over to 116th Hvy Bty, which would move in during June, so for several weeks the battery's gunners had to labour both to finish these positions for 116th Hvy Bty, and their own new positions, including a shell store for 400 rounds. Throughout May and through most of June, the battery fired on German positions around Adinfer Wood. 48th Heavy Artillery Group's main role was Counter-battery fire to destroy the German artillery facing 56th (1st London) Division's attack front, although the Territorials' 4.7-inch guns could not actually reach the German heavy gun positions in the rear, and accuracy of the 4.7-inch batteries was generally poor. The planned seven-day bombardment of the German positions began on 24 June but 1/1st Lowland Hvy Bty did not begin registering its guns on Bucquoy until 27 June (X Day). Later, the guns practised a six-minute 'hurricane' bombardment on the German positions in which the battery fired 68 rounds. Y Day was spent shelling German gun positions, but the weather was poor for observation, and the battery only fired 20 rounds. Because of the weather, the attack was postponed for two days, and the additional days (Y1 and Y2) were used for further bombardment. The battery was silent on Y1. On Y2, 48th HAG engaged 18 separate targets, and 1/1st Lowland Hvy Bty fired 220 rounds, but this was far below the 400 per battery permitted, because of continuing difficulties of observation. Many of these rounds were wide of their intended targets. The failure to neutralise the German guns would have disastrous results for the attacking infantry.MacDonald, Pro Patria, pp. 192‚Äì6.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, p. 460.Farndale, Western Front, p. 148.Ward, pp. 34 and 45. On Z Day (1 July), the entire artillery supporting 56th Division fired a 65-minute bombardment of the German front, starting at 06.25. At 07.30, the guns lifted onto their pre- arranged targets in the German support and reserve lines as the infantry got out of their forward trenches and advanced towards Gommecourt. At first, this went well for 56th Division. Despite casualties from the German counter- bombardment on their jumping-off trenches, the smoke and morning mist helped the infantry, and they reached the German front line with little loss and moved on towards the second and reserve lines. The artillery Observation Posts (OPs) reported the signboards erected by the leading waves to mark their progress. However, the OPs themselves came under attack from the German guns, which laid a Barrage across No man's land preventing supplies and reinforcements from reaching the leading infantry waves who had entered the German trenches. The heavy guns tried to suppress the German artillery, but the commander of 56th Division commented that although 'our counter-battery groups engaged a large number of German batteries ‚Äì the results were not apparent'. From 07.25 1/1st Lowland Hvy Bty spent the day firing mainly at battery positions around Le Quesnoy Farm at ranges around . Left and Right Sections (two guns each) each took a different target, then switched to another pair of targets at 07.40. It was not until 09.30 that the CO of 48th HAG could report that one of the Group's target batteries had been silenced. 1/1st Lowland Hvy Bty engaged the same four German batteries again at 10.46 and at 11.30, and fired on another battery near Adinfer Wood at 14.35, but none of these targets received more that 43 shells during the day (barely half the battery's allowance) and as the fire was unobserved the damage was probably negligible. (Although No 8 Squadron Royal Flying Corps identified 63 German batteries firing on VII Corps' front, many of these were out of range, and the aircrews were unable to spot fall of shot for the British guns because of smoke, haze and confusion.) By mid-afternoon, 56th Division's slight gains were being eroded by German counter-attacks, and all the remaining gains had to be abandoned after dark. VII Corps' costly attack was only a diversion from the main BEF attack further south, and was not renewed after the first day.Edmonds, pp. 462‚Äì4, 471‚Äì3.MacDonald, Pro Patria, pp. 258‚Äì67, 345, 364-8, 373‚Äì6, 385, 392‚Äì405.MacDonald, Offensive Spirit, pp. 426‚Äì7, 432, 519‚Äì20.Ward, p. 45. Arras RGA manhandling a 60-pounder gun, 1917. Over the next year, the 1/1st Lowland Hvy Bty was moved from one HAG to another as circumstances demanded. It was transferred to 46th on 28 August, 47th on 13 September and 8th on 5 October before returning to 47th on 29 December. All these moves were within Third Army, which was no longer involved in the Somme Offensive.'Allocation of HA Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1. The obsolescent 4.7-inch guns were progressively replaced in the BEF by 60-pounders during 1916. In December 1916, the WO decided that all heavy batteries should be composed of six guns and 1/1st Lowland Hvy Bty was brought up to that strength on 23 January 1917 when it was joined by a section of 201st Hvy Bty (newly arrived in France and immediately broken up). The battery rejoined 8th HAG on 13 January 1917. This group supported VII Corps in its attack at the opening of the Battle of Arras on 9 April. This time there were many more guns available and the artillery plan was much more carefully worked out. After the preliminary bombardment, howitzers laid a standing barrage on the German trenches at Zero hour while the 60-pounders swept and searched in depth to catch machine gunners and moving infantry. As the attacking infantry reached their second objective (the Blue Line), their field guns moved up in support and the 60-pounder batteries moved forward into the vacated positions. On VII Corps' front, the attack was partially successful, but infantry‚Äìartillery communication was still limited, and follow-up attacks over succeeding days suffered from hastily-prepared artillery plans.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 164‚Äì82.Ward, pp. 117‚Äì31. Later war After the Arras offensive, the 1/1st Lowland Hvy Bty was rested from 15 to 30 May. It then joined XVII Corps' Heavy Artillery on 8 June, being assigned to 35th HAG from 18 June, then 22nd HAG from 9 July, and then moved to 45th HAG in Fourth Army from 28 August. At the time, Fourth Army was on the Flanders Coast waiting to exploit a breakthrough from the Ypres Salient that never came. The battery was withdrawn from the line on 7 November, and was then resting, moving and training until 16 December. By now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed. From 28 December 1917 until the Armistice, 1/1st Lowland Hvy Bty was in 81st HAG, which became 81st Mixed Brigade, RGA, on 1 February 1918. The German Army opened its Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918 against Third and Fifth Armies. At the end of the first day 81st Bde was sent up to reinforce Third Army. During the 'Great Retreat' of March and early April, the artillery did their best to support rearguards until a new line was stabilised.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 265‚Äì71. 81st Brigade was transferred from Third Army to First Army on 1 May, and remained with it until the Armistice with Germany.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M. After the German offensive was held, the Allies went over to the attack themselves during the summer of 1918 (the Hundred Days Offensive). By now, British attacks were supported by massive artillery concentrations. When XXII Corps attacked on 24 October at the Battle of the Selle, its two divisions were supported by no fewer than eight RGA heavy brigades including the 81st. Half of the 'heavies' were used for counter-battery tasks, the rest for the bombardment and barrage.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 313‚Äì4.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 381‚Äì3. When the BEF demobilised in 1919, the battery was placed in suspended animation. =2/1st Lowland (City of Edinburgh) Heavy Battery= 2/1st Lowland Heavy Battery was raised at Edinburgh before the end of 1914. The 2nd Lowland Division (later numbered the 65th (2nd Lowland) Division) slowly assembled in early 1915, hampered by lack of equipment for training. By August 1915, it had concentrated around Bridge of Allan, with 2/1st Lowland Hvy Bty training alongside its 1st Line parent at Stirling. In November, the division moved into winter quarters, with the heavy battery at Buddon. Western Front In May 1916, the 2/1st Lowland Hvy Bty was sent to join the BEF, disembarking at Le Havre on 30 May. It joined VI Corps' Heavy Artillery in Third Army near Arras on 1 June, and was assigned to 8th HAG on 10 June. The battery was brought up to six guns on 31 July 1916, when it was joined by a section from the newly arrived 149th Hvy Bty. 8th HAG was not involved in the Gommecourt attack, and spent the rest of 1916 in routine trench warfare under Third Army. Like the 1/1st Battery, the 2/1st (also with 60-pounders) was moved from one HAG to another. On 25 November 1916, it was transferred to 35th HAG, on 17 December to 65th, then two days later to 54th, returning to 35th on 8 January 1917, then to 39th on 11 February, all within Third Army. Like its parent unit, 2/1st Lowland Hvy Bty in 39th HAG fired in support of VII Corps in the Arras offensive (see above). After Arras, 2/1st Lowland Hvy Bty moved back to 35th HAG on 30 May, to 58th on 9 June, and then on 16 June it returned to 39th HAG. On 5 October, it moved to 92nd HAG in Fifth Army, which was engaged in the final stages of the Battle of Passchendaele. Conditions for the gunners in this battle were appalling, with immense labour being required to position guns and gun platforms in thick mud on a bare slope without any cover. Exhausted artillery units were having to be rotated. After the battle ended, 2/1st Lowland Hvy Bty was rested from 18 December.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 211‚Äì4. A 60-pounder gun being moved up in 1918. On 5 January 1918, 2/1st Lowland Hvy Bty joined the mixed-calibre 93rd HAG (93rd (Mixed) Brigade, RGA, from 1 February), and remained with this brigade for the rest of the war. 93rd Brigade was at the time with Fourth Army, but on 14 March it transferred to Fifth Army, just in time to be caught up in the Spring Offensive and Great Retreat. 93rd Brigade moved to Fourth Army for the Battle of Amiens on 8 August 1918, supporting the Australian Corps in a barrage that was so thick and accurate that all the Australians' Phase 1 objectives were secured by 07.00, and scarcely a German shell fell after 05.40. The Australians continued to advance rapidly, sometimes running into their own barrage in their eagerness.Blaxland, pp. 167‚Äì71.Farndale, Western Front, p. 290. The advance continued in a succession of bounds through the Hundred Days Offensive. By early October the Australians were taken out of the line for rest, handing their artillery including 93rd Bde over to the II US Corps for the Battle of Cambrai, in which the Americans advanced up to the River Selle.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 188.Yockelson, pp. 193‚Äì8. By the time of the Battle of the Selle (see above), II US Corps was about to be withdrawn for rest, and 93rd Bde was assigned to IX Corps' Reserve. The heavy batteries were well forward so that they could shell the Germans' lines of retreat across the Sambre. 93rd Brigade was part of the massive artillery support for IX Corps' attack on 23 October. After the Battle of the Sambre, the campaign continued as a pursuit until the Armistice, in which the heavy artillery could only play a limited part.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 354‚Äì7.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 307‚Äì12.Yockelson, p. 209. When the BEF demobilised in 1919, the battery was disbanded. Interwar Dalmeny Street drill hall today When the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army in 1920‚Äì1, the Lowland (City of Edinburgh) Hvy Bty formed the basis of a new 2nd (Lowland) Medium Brigade, RGA, quickly renumbered as the 57th (Lowland) Medium Brigade, RGA. It consisted of one battery derived from the Lowland (City of Edinburgh) Hvy Bty, the others being converted from the 6th and 8th Battalions of the Royal Scots: * HQ at 6 Wemyss Place, Edinburgh * 225 (City of Edinburgh) Medium Bty at Drill Hall, 124 McDonald Road, Edinburgh ‚Äì from Lowland Hy Bty, RGA * 226 (City of Edinburgh) Medium Bty (Howitzers) at Drill Hall, Dalmeny Street, Leith ‚Äì from 6th Bn Royal Scots * 227 (Haddingtonshire) Medium Bty (Howitzers) at Drill Hall, Dalmeny Street, Leith ‚Äì from 8th Bn Royal Scots * 228 (Peeblesshire and Midlothian) Medium Bty (Howitzers) at High Street, Dunbar ‚Äì from 8th Bn Royal Scots (The Leith and Dunbar Drill Halls had previously belonged to the 7th Battalion, Royal Scots.) The CO (Lt-Col J.B. Cameron, DSO, TD) and senior major (E.G. Thompson, MC) of the new brigade were prewar officers of the 1st Lowland (City of Edinburgh) Hvy Bty. Affiliated to it were the cadet corps of North Berwick, Haddington, and Tranent Industrial School. The brigade served as 'Army Troops' in 52nd (Lowland) Divisional Area of Scottish Command.Titles and Designations, 1927. In 1924, the RGA was subsumed into the RA, and in 1938 RA brigades were redesignated as regiments. When the TA was doubled in size after the Munich Crisis of 1938, the regiment split into two:Scottish Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. * 57th (Lowland) Medium Rgt  Regimental HQ, 225 and 226 (City of Edinburgh) Btys at Edinburgh * 66th Medium Rgt  RHQ and 227 (Haddingtonshire) Bty at Prestonpans  228 (Peeblesshire and Midlothian) Bty at Leith Shortly after the outbreak of war in September 1939, 57th (Lowland) Medium Rgt was converted to the heavy artillery role, being redesignated 51st (Lowland) Heavy Regiment at Leith.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M. In 1942, the 66th Medium Rgt gained the 'Lowland' subtitle. World War II =51st (Lowland) Heavy Regiment= Battle of France At this time heavy regiments consisted of four 4-gun batteries, which in the 51st were designated A, B, C, and D. 51st (Lowland) Hvy Rgt would have been equipped with 6-inch guns (one Bty) and 9.2-inch howitzers (three batteries), both of World War I vintage.Forty, pp. 222‚Äì6. In November 1939, the newly converted regiment deployed to join the British Expeditionary Force in France under Lt-Col D. McDowell, who had been CO since 1936.Joslen, p. 462. On 10 May 1940, the Phoney War ended with the German invasion of the Low Countries, and the BEF followed the pre-arranged Plan D and advanced into Belgium to take up defences along the River Dyle. It was largely in position by 15 May and subject to German probing attacks.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter III. However, the Panzers of the Wehrmacht's Army Group A had broken through the Ardennes and threatened the BEF's flank, so on 16 May it began to withdraw to the River Escaut.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter IV. On 17 May a gap opened up between the BEF and the Belgian Army, and a battery of 51sth (L) Hvy Rgt was among the artillery reinforcements thrown into this gap along the River Dendre, where there was fierce fighting.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 45. After leaving rearguards on the Dendre, the BEF occupied the Escaut line on 21 May, but by now the enemy was in its rear. To hold the line of the Aire Canal north of Saint-Omer the BEF organised a scratch force of rear elements ('Polforce'), including 51st (L) Hvy Rgt, to defend the crossings. The bridge at Saint-Momelin was held for three days against 1st Panzer Division by one gun of 98th (Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry) Field Rgt and the gunners of 51st (L) Hvy Rgt acting as infantry, equipped with nothing more than rifles and a few Bren guns. They had the satisfaction of intercepting a German radio message that said 'Bridge at Momelin strongly held, try elsewhere'. The defenders at St Momelin were relieved by French troops on 25 May and fell back into the 'pocket' round Dunkirk from which the BEF was preparing evacuation (Operation Dynamo).Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 60, 74, Map 16.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter VII.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter VIII. Home defence All the BEF's heavy equipment such as artillery had to be disabled and left behind in France, and this could only be slowly replaced. By the Autumn of 1940, 51st (L) Hvy Rgt with its attached Royal Corps of Signals section had joined Western Command, facing the possibility of German invasion by sea and air. The available heavy guns were sited within range of likely landing places.Farndale, pp. 95‚Äì6.Collier, Chapter VIII.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery, 26 December 1940, TNA files WO 212/4 and WO 33/2365.

The anticipated invasion never came, and the field force in the UK began to prepare for offensive action once more. One innovation was the Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA), a powerful artillery brigade, usually comprising one heavy, three medium and one field regiment, which could be rapidly moved about the battlefield, and had the punch to destroy enemy artillery.Buckley, p. 41 & fn 60, p. 309.Ellis, Victory in the West, Vol I, Appendix IV.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 99. 51st (L) Hvy Rgt, together with its attached signal section and LAD, was assigned to 4 AGRA, formed in May 1943 as part of Second Army.Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/238.4 AGRA at RA 1939-45. By now, the RA's heavy regiments were equipped with two batteries of 7.2-inch howitzers and two of US-made 155mm 'Long Tom' guns. North West Europe 7.2-inch howitzer of 51st (Lowland) Heavy Regiment in France, 2 September 1944. 7.2-inch howitzer firing, 2 September 1944. 51st (Lowland) Heavy Rgt landed in Normandy with 4 AGRA in June 1944, shortly after D-Day.Joslen, p. 463. On 8 and 9 July, the guns of 4 AGRA were part of the massive artillery support for I Corps' attack on Caen (Operation Charnwood).Ellis, Victory in the West, Vol I, pp. 311‚Äì5. After the breakout from the Normandy beachhead, I Corps was tasked with clearing the port of Le Havre on 10 September (Operation Astonia), again supported by 4 AGRA engaged in counter-battery (CB) fire.Buckley, p. 193.Doherty, pp. 104‚Äì1.Ellis, Victory in the West, Vol II, p. 14. By now, I Corps was operating under the command of First Canadian Army advancing into the southern Netherlands.Ellis, Victory in the West, Vol II, p. 6. At the end of October, 51st (L) Hvy Rgt was detached from 4 AGRA to support II Canadian Corps in its attack on Walcheren (Operation Infatuate). It returned to 4 AGRA in I Corps on 4 November and deployed around Etten-Leur, with a section of 7.2s west of Breda, directing harassing fire (HF) against German movements on the Moerdijk bridges. From 5 to 8 November, the regiment was engaged in CB and HF tasks around the Maas estuary, 2 and 6 Btys expending 800 rounds on CB tasks on 6 November alone. On 11 November, the regiment moved, establishing RHQ at De Rips, with 1 and 2 Btys (7.2-inch) on 11th Armoured Division's front east of Deurne, 4 and 6 Btys (155mm) on 3rd Division's front between Oploo and Overloon. The gunners then spent the next few days preparing gun positions. From 15 to 24 November, 1 and 2 Btys supported 11th Armd Division and 15th (Scottish) Division in their attack towards the Mass, though there was only a little CB and counter-mortar (CM) fire. On 25 and 27 November, 4 Bty carried out shoots against a German strongpoint at Kasteel, directed by Air Observation Post (AOP) aircraft. On 28 and 29 November, 4 and 6 Btys carried out small CB programmes, but 1 and 2 Btys were now out of range. RA gunners load a US 155mm 'Long Tom' gun. On 1 December, the regiment moved back into Belgium to join XXX Corps. During late December the corps was diverted south to strengthen the northern side of the 'Bulge' formed by the German Ardennes Offensive, and by early January 1945, 51st (L) Hvy Rgt was with 9 AGRA in XII Corps in the southern Netherlands, supporting 7th Armoured and 52nd (Lowland) Divisions with CB and HF missions.Buckley, pp. 260‚Äì1.Ellis, Victory in the West, Vol II, p. 190. Once the Ardennes crisis was passed, Second Army began planning Operation Blackcock to clear the Roer Triangle. The regiment was split up, with the 7.2-inch howitzers of 1 Bty west of Sittard attached to 13th Medium Rgt in 3 AGRA, supporting 7th Armd Division, while 4 Bty was attached to 43rd (Wessex) Division for CM tasks. 51st (L) Heavy Rgt supplied 9 AGRA's liaison representatives at these two divisional HQs. The bulk of the regiment moved to Gangelt and began the artillery preparation for 'Blackcock' on 15 January. During this bombardment, 4 Bty fired on dug-in tanks near Berberen. On 20 January, the regiment shifted its positions so that the 155mm guns could reach targets across the River Ruhr. The fire tasks were completed and 4 Bty reverted to regimental control by 23 January. The regiment moved to 'harbour' at Loon op Zand 1‚Äì3 February except 2 Bty, which was under 68th Medium Rgt supporting the Canadians. For Operation Veritable (the clearance of the Klever Reichswald), 51st (L) Hvy Rgt reverted to 4 AGRA, which was assigned to XXX Corps to support 51st (Highland) Division. The batteries moved into 'hides' near Beers ahead of the operation. The assembly of heavy guns and ammunition in forward areas for this offensive along inadequate roads was a major achievement. The concentration of artillery fire was the greatest employed by the British Army so far in the war.Buckley, pp. 270‚Äì2.Ellis, Victory in the West, Vol II, pp. 255‚Äì7. The guns opened fire at H Hour (10.30) on 8 February. XXX Corps' commander, Lt-Gen Sir Brian Horrocks, later recalled that 'The noise was appalling, and the sight was awe-inspiring. All across the front shells were exploding. ... It soon became clear that the enemy was completely bemused as a result of our colossal bombardment; their resistance was slight'.Horrocks, pp. 248‚Äì9. The infantry followed the artillery fire closely, at the risk of incurring casualties from friendly fire, and overran the German forward positions. However, the battle slowed down into a series of short- range night and dawn attacks through flooded country from one 'island' village to another behind a barrage: 'it was a slog in which only two things mattered, training and guns ... Slowly and bitterly we advanced through the mud supported by our superb artillery'.Horrocks, pp. 250‚Äì1. The British artillery prevented the Germans from assembling effective counter-attack forces.Buckley, pp. 272‚Äì7. 51st (L) Heavy Rgt fired in support of 51st (H) Division, 15th (S) Division and 32nd Guards Brigade over succeeding days, shifting its position to near Gennep on 15 February. 'Veritable' ground on until 10 March, but succeeded in clearing the ground west of the Rhine.Buckley, p. 278. The Rhine crossing (Operation Plunder), involved an even greater concentration of artillery. 4 AGRA was once again supporting XXX Corps. The artillery opened fire at 17.00 on 23 March with CB fire to neutralise the 150 enemy guns that had been identified on the corps front, and that night the infantry crossings began. By 28 March, Second Army had broken out of its Rhine bridgehead and was pursuing the enemy across North Germany.Buckley, pp. 283‚Äì5.Ellis, Victory in the West, Vol II, pp. 285‚Äì8, 297.Horrocks, pp. 257‚Äì8. In early April, 51st (L) Hvy Rgt returned to the Netherlands to come under the command of 1st Canadian AGRA near Bemmel. From 12 to 17 April the regiment supported 49th (West Riding) Division's assault crossing of the River Ijssel and clearance of the enemy pocket at Arnhem. On the last day of this action 1 Bty supported the Independent Belgian Brigade by firing on an enemy-held factory. The battery commander personally established the OP and after 10 ranging shots the battery fired 20 rounds 'for effect', of which 12 were direct hits. The regiment moved to the Otterloo area, where there was little firing apart from night HF tasks, though 4 Bty sent a fighting patrol on foot to comb nearby woods for Germans. On 23 April, the regiment fired on two hostile batteries, but the fighting was coming to an end. Victory in Europe Day was declared on 8 May. The regiment was placed in suspended animation in 1946. =66th (Lowland) Medium Regiment= Home Defence 66th Medium Regiment was not deployed to France with the BEF, and thus avoided the evacuation from Dunkirk. During the 'invasion summer' of 1940 and up to the end of 1941 it formed the medium artillery component of V Corps in southern England.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D. At the beginning of the war, medium batteries were equipped with eight World War I 60-pounders or 6-inch howitzers. From 1941, however, these were progressively replaced by 4.5-inch and 5.5-inch medium guns. 66th Medium Rgt moved to Eastern Command in December 1941 and gained a signal section and LAD. During this period, it trained alongside 3rd Division. The regiment left Eastern Command in December 1942 and came under direct WO control preparatory to embarking for overseas service. By mid-February, it had sailed for the Middle East. Sicily and Italy On arrival in Egypt the regiment joined 6 AGRA, formed in May 1943 at Almaza. Shortly afterwards it came under Eighth Army, which at that time was planning for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky).6 AGRA at RA 1939‚Äì45. 66th (L) Medium Rgt landed in Sicily with one battery of 4.5-inch guns and one of 5.5s. It came into action on 17 July, together with six field regiments, in support of an attack on the Fossa Bottaceto, south of Catania, by 6th and 9th Bns Durham Light Infantry and the tanks of 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters). The guns fired a concentration for 30 minutes before Zero (which was at 01.00), then barrages and concentrations as required. The operation bogged down in close country and an attempt to restart it the next night broke down when the artillery was directed to fire on the Bottaceto itself, while German troops were still in position in front of it.Molony, Vol V, pp. 104‚Äì5. After Sicily had been secured, Eighth Army moved to the invasion of mainland Italy, with 6 AGRA supporting XIII Corps, tasked with crossing the Strait of Messina to land around Reggio di Calabria on 3 September (Operation Baytown). The assembled guns fired vast amounts of ammunition without reply, and the assault troops met little opposition on the lightly-held shore.Molony, Vol V, pp. 234, 238. By November, the Allies had advanced to the German Winter Line. 66th (L) Medium Rgt with 6 AGRA supported V Corps in the Battle of the Sangro. For three days from 29 November, the guns helped 78th and 8th Indian Divisions to break into the Bernhardt Line, the 5.5s firing over 350 rounds per gun and the 4.5s over 327, despite there being only one road up which to supply this ammunition. In the first half of December, during the Moro River Campaign, 2nd New Zealand Division supported by 6 AGRA and 66th (L) Medium Rgt made sustained but unsuccessful attempts to take the hilltop town of Orsogna.Molony, Vol V, pp. 489‚Äì500. After the long winter stalemate round Monte Cassino the Allied forces were reorganised for a spring offensive in 1944. Additional AOP aircraft were allocated, and 6 AGRA benefited from 'Rover David', a 'cab rank system' for direct fighter-bomber support that could be called down on fleeting targets.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 67‚Äì8. Once Rome had fallen in June, 6 AGRA was with XIII Corps in the pursuit to the Trasimene Line and the advance on Florence. During four days of preparation for 2nd New Zealand Division to assault the Arezzo position (10‚Äì14 July), the guns fired on enemy artillery batteries to cover the lull. The attack was an anti-climax, the terrain offering more resistance than the enemy, but the steep nature of the ground made accurate artillery support difficult, and there was heavier fighting on 15 July before the Germans broke contact and retreated. In the subsequent advance to the Gothic Line, the AGRAs were decentralised across the wide front, with medium regiments assigned to individual divisions.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 5, 76‚Äì9, 90. 6 AGRA continued with XIII Corps when that formation fought under Fifth US Army to breach the Gothic Line in September 1944.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 263. When 78th Division came back into the line in October, taking over positions in the Santerno Valley, 66th (L) Medium Rgt was directly attached to it, though the precarious bridges across the Santero made the relief and subsequent supply a very slow business.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 390‚Äì1. 6 AGRA remained in XIII Corps for the victorious Spring 1945 offensive in Italy (Operation Grapeshot).Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, p. 223. Sometime after the end of the war, either in 1946 or 1947, the 66th (Lowland) Medium Regiment was disbanded. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment reformed at Edinburgh as 357th (Lothians) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery, changing the 'Lothians' subtitle to 'Lowland' in 1955. It formed part of 85 AGRA.Litchfield, Appendix 5.

(278th Field Rgt was descended from the 1st Lowland Brigade, RFA, to which the Edinburgh City Artillery had contributed one battery in 1908, see above.)266‚Äì288 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. When the TA was reduced in 1967, 278th Fd Rgt became Q (City of Edinburgh) Battery in a combined Lowland Regiment, Royal Artillery, which was disbanded in 1975.Litchfield, p. 294.  Reformation  As a result of Army 2020, on 5 November 2014, 278 (Lowland) Battery was formed in Livingston, and shortly thereafter formed a detachment in Edinburgh completing the lineage link. As part of the 105th Regiment Royal Artillery, the battery was equipped with the L118 light gun as part of 105th Regiment Royal Artillery. Uniforms and insignia The original uniform of the Edinburgh City Artillery was a dark blue tunic, black braided, with blue collar and cuffs that were later changed to scarlet, and a red stripe down the trousers. Officers wore black lace at first, later changed to white or silver cord and then red from 1878. A Busby was worn in full dress up to 1908, and a round peakless Forage cap in undress, with a different badge for each battery. Most of the battery badges were a variation on the Royal Arms of Scotland. The badge on the grenade-shape busby plume holder and officers' Sabretaches used the arms of Edinburgh above a scroll inscribed 'EDINBURGH CITY ARTILLERY'. While training with 3rd Division in 1942, 66th (Lowland) Medium Rgt wore a blue diamond-shaped shoulder flash bearing the numeral 7 embroidered in red. In 1958 the sword and full-dress pouch that had belonged to Sir Joseph Noel Paton, was presented by his family to 278th (Lowland) Fd Rgt, successors to 1st Lowland Brigade. They were worn by the commander of P (1st City of Edinburgh) Battery on every Royal saluting parade until 1967.

History Ambulance of American Medical Bureau in Spain (1937) In 1941, the Joint Anti- Fascist Refugee Committee was formed by Lincoln Battalion veterans of the Spanish Civil War to provide aid to Spanish Loyalists refugees from Francoist Spain. JAFRC superseded previous groups, including the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy and American Medical Bureau (the latter of which Barsky had founded in 1936). Specifically, JAFRC was \\"dedicated to the rescue and relief of thousands of anti-fascist fighters trapped in Vichy, France, and North Africa\\" so that they might \\"return to the active fight against the Axis.\\" JAFRC established a fundraising organization called \\"Spanish Refugee Appeal\\" of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee.\\" Dorothy Parker took charge of the committee's fundraising and the anti-fascists soon attracted the support of Leonard Bernstein, Albert Einstein, Lillian Hellman, Langston Hughes, and Orson Welles. In 1942, it was licensed to do so in Vichy France by President Franklin Roosevelt's wartime administration, and the anti- fascists were then granted tax-exempt status. In 1946, the JAFRC began to face nearly-constant attack from federal government organizations. In 1948, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) rescinded JAFRC's tax-exempt status. Thereafter, the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB) tried to force JAFRC to register as a communist front organization. In April 1951, Allan Rosenberg successfully argued for the complainant Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee in Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath before the US Supreme Court. In 1955, the JAFRC board voted to disband. People =Leaders= According to letterhead dated March 17, 1944, leaders included: * Walter Rautenstrauch, National Honorary Chairman * Edward K.

Life and career Robertson was born in Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, in 1885. He played juvenile football for the Bonhill Union club before signing for Vale of Leven in 1903. In the 1904‚Äì05 season, he scored in all but three of Vale's matches, and his goalscoring attracted attention from major clubs on both sides of the border, including Aston Villa and Rangers. In May 1905, he went to England to join Blackburn Rovers. The additional ¬£50 payable should Robertson play for Rovers' first team was soon forthcoming, as he went on to score 22 goals from 78 Football League First Division matches over three seasons, before moving on to the English Southern League with Brighton & Hove Albion. After a single season in which both he and his team struggled for form, he was one of several players released and he returned to Vale of Leven, by then a member of the Scottish League. He was appointed captain of Vale, and returned to form, topping the Division Two scoring charts in 1909‚Äì10. In February 1911, he was transferred to Division One club Falkirk: Blackburn Rovers still held his league registration, and included it as a makeweight in their purchase of Jock Simpson. Vale of Leven had hoped that Falkirk would not want the player and would immediately transfer him back to them, but that did not happen. He went straight into Falkirk's team for the next match, against Clyde, and scored twice in a 4‚Äì1 win. Thus he began a lengthy stay, interrupted by the First World War, in which he scored 75 goals from 160 Division One matches and was Falkirk's top scorer for each of his first four full seasons. In 1912‚Äì13, he played for the Home Scots against the Anglos in an international trial. The Glasgow Herald reporter thought the \\"disappointing\\" match would be of little value to the selectors, in part because of a perceived lack of effort by some of the participants compared with that shown in a competitive fixture. Robertson hit the crossbar in the first half, the match finished goalless, and no call-up ensued. That same season, he helped Falkirk reach the Cup Final, in which they faced Raith Rovers at Celtic Park. Despite the Courier view that Robertson was \\"the least noticeable\\" of Falkirk's forwards, as [James] Logan \\"saw to it that the bulky centre did not get off the leash\\", he was off it long enough to open the scoring after Jimmy Croal's shot was saved, and Tom Logan's second-half goal gave his team a 2‚Äì0 win and their first Scottish Cup. During the war, Robertson served as a sergeant in the Highland Light Infantry, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Military Medal. He was able to play wartime football, when his military duties allowed, and turned out for teams including Dunfermline Athletic, Armadale and Vale of Leven. He played for Vale after the war, as well as for Dumbarton Harp, and had one last season in Division One with Dumbarton. Robertson died in London in 1968 at the age of 83.

Long Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana after the war. Early life Creger was born on December 24, 1918 to Charles and Rosa Creger, in Noble, Oklahoma. She was the fourth of six children and graduated from high school in Norman, Oklahoma, afterwards she worked as a professional dancer for Catherine Duffy's Productions in Oklahoma City, continuing on to become a professional model for Kickerknick Lingerie with plans to become a designer. Her first flight was with renowned aviator Wiley Post in 1927 when she was eight years old as part of a contest to collect bread wrappers. Military service Creger received her WASP flight training at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas, and graduated in the final WASP class (44-W-10) in W 10-Flight I on December 7, 1944. She began her training in class 44-W-8, but was held back due to illness. Because there were no medical facilities at the training location in Sweetwater, Creger was transferred‚Äîalong with trainees Mary Shaw and Laura Rutledge‚Äîto the hospital at Big Spring Army Air Field, under the care of Dr. Weldon W. Stephen. Creger later used this experience to help in lobbying for militarization of women who served as WASPs so that they could gain veteran benefits, which was granted on November 23, 1977 after a unanimous Senate vote. During World War II she served as a pilot and an engineering test pilot at Waco Army Air Field. Retired U.S. Air Force Col.

It stars Ben Affleck, Al Madrigal, Michaela Watkins, and Janina Gavankar, and follows an alcoholic construction worker who is recruited to become head coach of the basketball team at the high school he used to attend. The film was theatrically released in the United States on March 6, 2020, by Warner Bros. Pictures. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic causing movie theaters across the globe to close, Warner Bros. made the film available to own digitally on March 24, 2020. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with Affleck's performance receiving praise. Plot Jack Cunningham is an alcoholic construction worker who is separated from his wife, Angela. While at Thanksgiving dinner with his mother, his sister Beth, and her family, Beth reveals that friends, including Angela, have expressed concern about his drinking and isolation from friends and family. The next day, Jack receives a call from Father Devine at his Catholic high school Bishop Hayes, where he was a star basketball player and led the team to multiple championships. Father Devine asks him to step in as the school's basketball coach, as the current coach has suffered a heart attack. Jack is initially reluctant, but accepts the job. Jack is introduced to assistant coach and algebra teacher Dan, as well as members of the team. Bishop Hayes has only won one game, and has not gone to the playoffs since Jack was a student. As a result, student interest in basketball has dropped greatly, leaving the team with just six varsity players. Among these players are Brandon, the team's introverted point guard and most talented player, and Marcus, the team's center, who aggravates his teammates and Jack with his attitude. Angela meets with Jack and reveals that she is seeing someone new. Jack continues drinking heavily; his friend Doc takes him home from the bar every night, making sure he arrives safely. The team faces Memorial, a larger school with a much more talented team, in one of Jack's first games as coach. Trailing significantly and frustrated at a perceived lack of effort, Jack benches Marcus and demands the team play with more toughness. Nevertheless, Bishop Hayes loses badly. Dan begins to notice signs of Jack's alcoholism, including an allusion to his drinking habits by Memorial's coach and finding beer cans in Jack's office. After a game one night, Jack drives by Brandon walking alone and gives him a ride home. Brandon reveals that his mother is dead and his father cares for his younger brothers, leaving him unable to attend his games. Jack begins to institute strategic changes to the team, adopting a full-court press defense and a focus on conditioning to make up for the team's relative lack of size and talent. The team is initially annoyed by the stricter practices and Jack's aggressive attitude, but soon grow to respect him. When Marcus arrives late for the next game, Jack kicks him off of the team. Jack's changes result in a close game, and he draws up a play that allows Brandon to pass to a teammate for the game- winning shot. Jack encourages him to take the shot himself as the team's best player, and to develop his leadership skills. He pushes Brandon to be more vocal on the court, eventually naming him team captain. Marcus comes to Jack's house unannounced to ask to be allowed back on the team, and Jack eventually relents. The team continues to succeed, and Jack develops a bond with his players. His drinking decreases, and he begins to spend more time with his family and friends. Jack and Angela attend a birthday party for David, the son of Jack and Angela's friend Miguel. It is revealed that Jack and Angela had a son, Michael, who died from cancer. David and Michael were in the hospital together; David is now in remission. On a drive home, Jack reveals to Brandon that his father was neglectful, only paying attention to Jack when his basketball talent was discovered. As a result, Jack turned down a full athletic scholarship to the perennial powerhouse basketball program at the University of Kansas, and has not touched a basketball since. With Bishop Hayes needing just one win to make the playoffs, they give up a 4th quarter lead to an inferior team. While protesting a call, Jack is ejected; Bishop Hayes loses the game. Their final game of the season is a rematch with Memorial. Jack visits Brandon's father Russ at his work, informing him that Brandon has received attention from college recruiters. Russ, who was a college basketball player himself, has discouraged his son from using basketball as a ticket to a better life. At the game, Memorial jumps out to an early lead, but Bishop Hayes gradually mounts a comeback. On the final play, Jack draws up a play for Brandon to pass out for an open shot, but reconsiders, telling Brandon to take the shot himself. Brandon makes the shot, winning the game for Bishop Hayes. Later, Jack receives a call from Angela, telling him David is in the hospital. While visiting, Jack and Angela overhear a doctor informing David's parents his cancer has returned. The sight of their grief disturbs Jack, who leaves the hospital and returns to his regular bar, where he begins drinking again. The following morning, Jack arrives to practice late and still drunk, falsely blaming his absence on a power outage. Dan informs Father Devine, who fires Jack, telling him he is unable to trust him around the team and fears he has a serious problem. Jack resumes drinking heavily. One night, while driving drunk with a woman he meets at the bar, Jack rear-ends a boat hitched to a parked car. The woman flees, telling him to enter her house through the back. Jack accidentally enters the wrong house, where he is confronted by its occupants. Jack attempts to leave before the police arrive, but the confrontation becomes physical. He is pushed down the front steps of the house and is knocked unconscious in the street. Jack awakens in the hospital where he is met by Beth, who demands he get help for his alcoholism. Jack begins to attend therapy, and starts to open up about his son's death. He meets with his wife and apologizes for his past mistakes. The Bishop Hayes team dedicates their first playoff game to Jack; Brandon sees that his father and brothers are in attendance. Meanwhile, at an outdoor court, Jack picks up a basketball, beginning to shoot.

Release The film was originally scheduled to be released on October 18, 2019. However, in March 2019, it was pushed back several months to March 6, 2020. On March 19, Warner Bros. Pictures announced that the film would be available digitally in the United States and Canada through Premium VOD on March 24 due to movie theaters closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. This was just two weeks after the film's theatrical debut and before the end of the usual 90-day theatrical run. Another film distributed by the studio, Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn, was also released earlier than expected for the same reason. The film was released on Blu-ray, and DVD on May 19, 2020.https://www.newdvdreleasedates.com/m5838/the-way-back-dvd-release- date Reception =Box office= The Way Back grossed $13.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $14.7 million, against a production budget of $21‚Äì25 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Onward and the wide expansion of Emma, and was projected to gross $7‚Äì10 million from 2,718 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $2.6 million on its first day. The film went on to debut to $8.5 million, finishing third at the box office. The film fell 70% in its second weekend to $2.4 million, finishing seventh, largely caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 186 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"The Way Backs occasionally frustrating treatment of a formulaic story is often outweighed by Ben Affleck's outstanding work in the central role.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 3.5 out of 5 stars from viewers they polled, with 54% saying they would definitely recommend it. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Affleck gives the impression of intimate familiarity with the anguish and self-disgust that dominate Jack's life; this character and project clearly meant something important to him, as the title bluntly suggests, and he gives it his all without overdoing the melodrama.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety said that \\"Ben Affleck is compelling in a drama of addiction and redemption that plays off his own tabloid odyssey. But the tabloid version was better.\\"  References   External links   * Category:2020 films Category:2020s high school films Category:2020s sports drama films Category:American films Category:American basketball films Category:American high school films Category:American sports drama films Category:English- language films Category:Films about alcoholism Category:Films directed by Gavin O'Connor Category:Films scored by Rob Simonsen Category:Films set in California Category:Pearl Street Films films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Teen sports films ","title":"The Way Back (2020 film)"},{"id":"58593208","text":"Lauderhill 6-12 STEM-MED is a secondary (middle and high) school in Lauderhill, Florida.

Turnbull founded and owned the Green Bay Press-Gazette and was the first president of the Green Bay Football Corporation, the non-profit organization that owns the Green Bay Packers. He served as publisher, general manager, and business manager of the Press- Gazette for 45 years. During the early years of the Green Bay Packers, Turnbull helped convert the team from a privately held franchise to a publicly owned, non-profit corporation. He also helped the team through multiple financially challenging periods, which saw him identified as part of The Hungry Five, a group of early Packers supporters. Between 1923 and 1928, he served as the first president of the Green Bay Football Corporation and remained on the corporation's board of directors and executive committee until 1949. Turnbull died in 1960 and was elected to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1977. Early life Andrew Blair Turnbull was born in London, Ontario, on February 26, 1884, to John and Janet () Turnbull; he was the youngest of four children. In 1887 the family moved to Windsor, Ontario, where Turnbull attended public school until the age of 15. In 1893 Turnbull's father, who was a train conductor, died from injuries sustained in a railroad accident. Newspaper career In 1899 at the age of 15, Turnbull moved to the United States to take a job as an office boy for The Detroit News. After six years in Detroit, he moved to Bay City, Michigan and worked as an office manager for The Bay City Times. In 1907, he became the advertising manager for the Duluth News Tribune, but only worked there for one year. He moved on to the Saginaw Daily News in Michigan, working as the advertising manager. In 1914, Turnbull became a United States citizen. He moved from Saginaw to Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1915 and formed the Green Bay Newspaper Company with John Kline and Victor Minahan. Turnbull had met Kline while working in Saginaw; together the three men purchased the Green Bay Gazette and the Green Bay Free Press, which at the time were competitors and both struggling. The three men merged the papers into the Green Bay Press-Gazette, an afternoon daily paper. In 1920, Turnbull and his associates again purchased and merged two competing papersThe Appleton Post and The Appleton Crescentto form the Appleton Post-Crescent. From 1915 to 1930, Turnbull was the business manager and treasurer of the Green Bay Newspaper Company. His business partner John Kline passed away in 1930; Turnbull took over his role as general manager. He would hold this position until 1953, while also serving as the executive vice president. In 1954, he became the president of the Green Bay Newspaper Company after Victor Minahan died. He decreased his day-to-day management of the company in 1950s and 1960s due to poor health, but retained his ownership shares until his death. Green Bay Packers Turnbull was an early fan of the Green Bay Packers and was acquainted with its two founders, Curly Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun. Calhoun worked with Turnbull as an editor for the Press-Gazette. His newspaper has also been recognized for playing an essential role in the early development of the team. Since the Packers were a small-town team, they relied on local businessmen and civic leaders for support. One of the first recorded interactions between Turnbull and the Packers came in 1922. The Packers were set to play a team from Duluth, Minnesota on Thanksgiving; however, 12 straight hours of rain threatened to cancel it. If the game was cancelled, the Packers would have still needed to pay the Duluth team, which without any tickets sales or other financing would have bankrupted the team. Lambeau, Calhoun, and other team leaders met in the Press-Gazette building to discuss what should be done. Turnbull happened to stop by the building and was quickly brought into the group to make a decision. Turnbull convinced the Packers to play the game, even though they would lose a significant amount of money, by promising to rally local business leaders to support the team. Turnbull fulfilled his promise, organizing a stock sale that raised $5,500 and converted the Packers into a publicly owned, non-profit football team. In 1923, Turnbull was elected to lead the new publicly owned Green Bay Football Corporation as its first president. Turnbull served as president of the corporation until 1928 and was on the board of directors until 1949. His primary contribution as president was helping to keep the Packers in Green Bay during a time when the National Football League (NFL) was paring its member teams down to those located in large cities. Turnbull represented the Packers at NFL meetings and was appointed to a committee in 1926 to help rewrite the NFL's constitution and by-laws. He was so widely respected in the NFL that after resigning as president of the Packers, he was appointed to the NFL's executive committee. Personal life Turnbull was active in many local civic institutions, including as the founder and first president of the Oneida Golf and Riding Club. He also served on the board of directors for two banks in the Green Bay area: the Peoples Trust & Savings Bank and the Bank of Green Bay. During World War I and World War II, he volunteered for various war efforts, including selling Liberty Bonds and organizing membership drives for the Red Cross. Turnbull married Susan Boyle in 1908; they had two daughters: Catherine Beisel () and Janet Schneiderman (). Boyle died on August 9, 1944. Turnbull married Jessie Whelan in 1949; Whelan died nine years later in 1958. After suffering from various ailments for the last part of his life, Turnbull suffered a heart attack at his home in Allouez, Wisconsin and died on October 17, 1960, at the age of 76. Legacy Turnbull was well-respected as a newspaper executive for establishing the Green Bay Press-Gazette and the Appleton Post-Crescent, two successful newspapers that are still in distribution . He was also widely respected for helping to lead the early development of the Green Bay Packers and the NFL. He was informally identified as part of The Hungry Five, a nickname given by Arch Ward, a writer for the Chicago Tribune, to five of the early Green Bay business leaders who supported the Packers. Multiple writers have identified Turnbull as a key figure in the early formation and continued success of the Packers. His contributions include the organization of the Green Bay Football Corporation, leading the first stock sale, and raising additional funds during periods of financial difficulties. He also provided leadership as the first president of the Corporation, especially when representing the Packers during NFL meetings and the drafting of the League's constitution and by-laws. In recognition of his leadership during the early years of the Packers, as well as his role as the first team president under the non-profit corporation structure, Turnbull was elected to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1977.

Early life and career St. Louis receives the Patriarch of Jerusalem in Damietta, Jean-Marie Oscar Gu√© (1847) Robert was a native of the Saintonge.\\"Catalogue historique des √©v√™ques et abb√©s de Bretagne\\", p. xvii, in Charles Taillandier, Histoire eccl√©siastique et civile de Bretagne, t. II (Paris, 1756). He was a bishop in Apulia, but was expelled by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. In 1236, Pope Gregory IX appointed him bishop of Nantes. In Nantes, Robert came into conflict with Peter I, Duke of Brittany and Peter's son John, whom the church accused of appropriating ecclesiastical property. Robert complained several times to Gregory and appealed to the pope in person in Rome in 1238.Louis de Mas Latrie, \\"Les patriaches latins de J√©rusalem\\", in Revue de l'Orient latin, vol. 1 (1893), pp. 22‚Äì23. Meanwhile, Emperor Frederick claimed the regency of the Kingdom of Jerusalem for his underage son Conrad II, whose mother, Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem, had died in childbirth. However, Frederick had been excommunicated by Gregory IX. In 1239, Gerold of Lausanne, Patriarch of Jerusalem, died during the Barons' Crusade. The canons of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem selected the former Bishop of Acre, Jacques de Vitry, as his replacement, but as Jacques had recently died, Gregory IX appointed Robert instead in May 1240. Gregory likely appointed Robert because of his experience with Frederick in Apulia.Bernard Hamilton, The Latin Church in the Crusader States: The Secular Church (London: Variorum, 1980), p. 262. Gregory IX died in 1241 and was eventually succeeded by Pope Innocent IV in 1243. In the meantime, Robert remained in Europe and did not arrive in Jerusalem until 1244. Soon after his arrival, the Khwarazmian Turks captured Jerusalem. The Khwarazmians allied with Egypt and defeated a combined army from Jerusalem and Damascus at the Battle of La Forbie in October of the same year. Robert was present at the battle and barely escaped. In 1247, Robert sent a relic of the Holy Blood to Henry III of England in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to convince him to go on crusade. The subsequent Seventh Crusade was instead led by King Louis IX of France, who invaded Egypt in 1250. Louis was defeated and taken captive at the Battle of al-Mansourah, and Robert was imprisoned along with him.Hamilton, pp. 263‚Äì265.  Death  Robert died on 8 June 1254.Hamilton, p. 267. He may have been over 80 years old; Jean of Joinville describes him as \\"an old and venerable man aged eighty years\\" at the time of his captivity with Louis in 1250.Caroline Smith, ed., Joinville and Villehardouin: Chronicles of the Crusades (Penguin, 2008), p. 235. The canons of the Holy Sepulchre chose Opizzo Fieschi, Latin patriarch of Antioch, to succeed Robert. Opizio was the nephew of Innocent IV, but Innocent died before he could confirm this choice. Innocent's successor Pope Alexander IV appointed the bishop of Verdun and future pope Jacques Pantaleon as patriarch.Hamilton, p. 233.

Music and lyrics Like \\"The Horizontal Bop\\", and unlike the more successful previous singles from Against the Wind, \\"Her Strut\\" is a fast-paced rocker. Journalist Bill King described it as being \\"screechy voiced\\" and said it reminded him of the Eagles' song \\"The Long Run\\". Roy Trakin of The Daily News felt it lacked the drive of the more popular, slower songs from Against the Wind. But Arizona Daily Star critic Pam Parrish felt it has \\"the same rhythmic tension that characterized [earlier Seger fan favorites] 'The Fire Down Below' and 'Come to Poppa.'\\" Some listeners criticized the lyrics of \\"Her Strut\\" for objectifying women. Music journalist Jimmy Guterman and arts editor Owen O'Donnell criticized \\"Her Strut\\" as a \\"bewildering lame ditty\\" whose singer \\"sounds like an aging high school football jerk who never grew out of thinking of 'girls' as either virgins or whores.\\" Rolling Stone critic Dave Marsh criticized it for belittling women when they try to assert themselves. Seger objected to Marsh's accusation of misogyny stating \\"My God, I don't hate women. I'm for women standing up.\\" Seger went on to state that he used the sexist sounding chorus because he liked the way the sound of the word \\"strut\\" worked in the song and that he attempted to counter any sexist connotations in the verses, saying: > But anyway, \\"Her Strut.\\" The very title conjures up an image to me, ya know? > And it's something I had to work my way around, 'cause saying \\"I love to > watch her strut\\" is almost an automatic sexist thing. \\"Her Strut.\\" I really > struggled with that, I did.

Women have to > understand that it's still gonna be human nature. Can't turn off the > hormones. I didn't wanna look like I'm some sort of sexist monster, and I'm > not. I'm really not. Honest to God. Seger has also stated that \\"Her Strut\\" was inspired by political activist Jane Fonda and her appearance before the Campaign for Economic Democracies. He stated \\"I was quite proud of her for doing that. I admired her crust. For going in there and having the strength to speak her mind, so I kind of wrote 'Her Strut' for an '80s woman ... you know, it was the dawn of the '80s, and I wanted to write a song about how women have become so confident and stepped out so much, and I thought Jane was a great role model.\\" AXS critic Jeff Wallace feels that Seger succeeded in his objective stating that the song tells of \\"a strong independent woman and how she won't be controlled by anyone.\\" Fonda has claimed to be flattered by the song, stating that \\"you‚Äôll know why when you hear the lyrics.\\" Other appearances \\"Her Strut\\" was included on Seger's 2003 compilation album Greatest Hits 2 and on the 2011 compilation album Ultimate Hits: Rock and Roll Never Forgets.

He was a speculator in mining. Normanton Hall, Rutland - the Mackworth family seat Biography Mackworth was the only surviving son of Sir Thomas Mackworth, 3rd Baronet and his second wife Anne Mackworth, daughter of Colonel Humphrey Mackworth, of Betton, Shropshire. His father died in November 1694 and he succeeded to his estates, his seat in Parliament and the baronetcy. Mackworth was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Rutland at a by- election on 17 December 1694 following the death of his father. He did not stand for election in 1695 but was High Sheriff of Rutland for the year 1696 to 1697. At the first general election in 1701 Mackworth was returned unopposed as MP for Rutland and was returned again in the second general election of 1701, 1702 and 1705. He did not stand in the general elections in 1708 and 1710. He became involved with his cousin Sir Humphrey Mackworth in mining and smelting ventures in south Wales and acted as a partner when Sir Humphrey bought some lead mines formerly owned by Sir Carbery Pryse, 4th Baronet and when the Company of Mine Adventurers was floated in 1698. He was a director of the company from the outset. In 1704 the Company of Mine Adventurers received a Royal Charter, but by 1710 was running into financial difficulties which resulted in a parliamentary enquiry. Mackworth pleaded lack of financial expertise and lack of involvement in the decisions that led to failure, but was debarred from being a Director of the Company. At the 1713 general election he was returned on behalf of the administration as MP for Portsmouth, but did not stand for Parliament in 1715. It was said in 1716 that he had profited greatly by shrewd investments at the time of the Jacobite rebellion. He invested further in the Company of Mine Adventurers, of which he became a Director again in 1721. He was returned unopposed for Rutland as a Tory at a by-election on 5 April 1721 and headed the poll in 1722. However, he was ruined financially by the cost of this contest and his estates including Normanton Hall were sold by order of the court of Chancery to pay his debts, He did not stand at the 1727 general election. On a visit to Paris in 1729 he expressed strong pro-Jacobite sentiments. Private life Mackworth died unmarried at Kentish Town in North London in February 1745, leaving most of his property to his sisters, and the baronetcy passed to a cousin Thomas Mackworth, an apothecary in Huntingdon He also left some property in trust for a supposed illegitimate son, Thomas Mackworth.

Reception The album received generally favorable reviews, with both Punk Rock Theory and Ghost Cult magazine praising the band for picking up where they left of seven years before. Mixed reviews came from Sleaze Roxx, which criticized the album's focus on pop-punk as opposed to the band's heavier sound on previous albums, while Pure Rawk disdained the album's attempts at ballads and bluesy rock songs.

Texas is a state with a unique cultural history and complex story of development. This individuality has shaped a state-wide construct of indomitable demographic pride. Texas has officially been nicknamed \\"The Lone Star State\\" as a tribute to the state's time as a sovereign nation. While Texans are also proud to be Americans, the spirit of independence still exists among Texans. Exactly where this symbolism came from is up for debate as many historians have different arguments. However, the Texas State Legislature says the following regarding The Lone Star State: > \\"Whatever its origins, and whatever its uses, from the serious to the > playful, the phrase 'The Lone Star State' has achieved universal currency as > a sharp and memorable way to evoke the unique legacy of Texas and the > indomitable spirit of its people\\"Guillen. ‚ÄúConcurrent Resolution.‚Äù 84(R) HCR > 78 - Introduced Version - Bill Text, > capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/HC00078I.htm.  Events  The Lone Star State The events of Texas history contribute to the state-wide identity and cultural nationalism that Texans possess. The Battle of the Alamo was a pivotal event in Texas history and arguably sparked the flame of Texas pride.Defenders of the Alamo: Who Were They , and Why Did They Do It?\\" Torch Magazine, Spring 2016, 8-11. During this fight for freedom, people from across the United States came to Texas to support the cause. However, contrary to popular belief, they didn‚Äôt come as courageous men who had a burning desire to fight for Texan Independence. Instead, many were drawn to Texas by the hopeful prospect of a new beginning. Their stories and struggles inevitably became part of Texas history and contributed to what would soon emerge as intense state pride. As the war for independence went on, this iconic pride that Americans known so well today, began to develop. Men like James Bowie, David Crockett, as well as lesser-known Texas heroes, like James Bonham and Almeron Dickenson, began to emerge as the cause for the fight became more personal and the pride in Texas and desire for independence grew. Eventually, the war came to a point where victory seemed impossible. Many, justifiably so, chose to leave in order to spare their own lives. However, others chose to risk their lives in a war that seemed unwinnable. While the battle was lost, the cry \\"Remember the Alamo\\" still rings across the land as a memorial of the acts of courage that took place nearly two centuries ago. These men, these volunteers, these martyrs mark the beginning of an unmatched cultural nationalism that would stand tall and true through decades of change. The Battle of the Alamo In April 1836, Texas gained independence after defeating the Mexican army at The Battle of San Jacinto. Their status as an independent country remained intact until 1845 when they became the 28th state to be seceded into the Union.Alchin, Linda. ‚ÄúTexas History Timeline.‚Äù Texas History Timeline, Siteseen Ltd, Mar. 2018, www.datesandevents.org/american- timelines/43-texas-history-timeline.htm. During this period of independence that lasted almost a decade, patriotism flourished. This patriotism that was developed during this period of sovereignty undoubtedly continued once Texas became part of the Union and remains a thriving aspect of Texas culture today.  Media  Media plays a large role in promoting this cultural unity and nationalistic state pride. A song written by June Hershey and Don Swander called ‚ÄúDeep in the Heart of Texas‚Äù can be heard at events across the state. Sports teams like the San Antonio Spurs, Texas Rangers, Dallas Stars, and Dallas Mavericks feature this song at home games. Texas pride is channeled as thousands of fans stand up and shout the lyrics. In 1985, the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Mess With Texas‚Äù campaign was launched. It was originally launched by the Texas Department of Transportation as an ad discouraging littering on Texas roadways. Today, it has morphed into a slogan that is used to promote Texas pride. The Texas Department of Transportation prides themselves on the creation of this slogan as it still fuels Texas state pride.\\"Don't Mess with Texas.\\" Don‚Äôt Mess With Texas .http://www.dontmesswithtexas.org/about/history/. From 1978-1991 an American Primetime TV show aired called ‚ÄúDallas.‚Äù The show depicted a wealthy family, who own an independent oil company. A picture perfect family like this, tied directly to Texas, furthers the Texas superiority stereotype and fuels Texas pride. Texas historian and fanatic T.R. Fehrenbach authored books that told the Texas tale. He wrote that \\"Texas was not a society, but a people\\" and he believed that the history of Texas was so powerful that it was \\"based on, but not limited by facts.\\" Fehrenbach was considered one of Texas' greatest historians and fearlessly promoted the narrative that everything is, indeed, bigger and better in Texas.  Psychology  Demographic pride in Texas has been created and furthered as children are taught at a young age what Texas is all about. Studies show that exposing children to stereotypes good or bad, reinforces the validity of the stereotypes in their minds and creates a long- lasting bias towards these subjects. This is displayed in the Texas education system as they encourage vast amounts of curriculum centered on Texas history. In fact, when compared to every other state, the Texas Education Agency demands that a greater amount of state history curriculum be incorporated into the school year as young students are expected to extensively understand different eras of Texas history through the modern day.Erenkrantz, Justin R. ‚ÄúDon't Mess With Texas Justin R.

The children who grow up learning to take such pride in their state grow up to be adults who continue to push the \\"Texas is the best\\" narrative. This cycle continues and as a result, Texans, as a whole, outwardly portray immense amounts of state pride. In addition to regulated curriculum, Texas law requires that the pledge of allegiance to the United States flag as well as the pledge of allegiance to the Texas flag be said on a daily basis followed by a moment of silence.‚ÄúTexas Education Code Sec. ¬ß 25.082 Pledges of Allegiance; Minute of Silence.‚Äù Texas Education Code Section 25.082 - Pledges of Allegiance; Minute of Silence - 2017 Texas Statutes - Texas.Public.Law, 2013, texas.public.law/statutes/tex._educ._code_section_25.082.

As a child, he sang well, and his parents actively encouraged the development of his vocal capabilities. In addition to secondary education, Ionesyan had a diploma from music school, thanks to which he, as a good student, was accepted in the Tbilisi State Conservatoire. In the second year of the conservatoire he went to work in the theater, where he worked until December 13, 1963. Details of Ionesyan's biography differ in various sources. According to one version, when Ionesyan was still in school, his father was sentenced to seven years for trading fraud, which is why, presumably, Vladimir went along the crooked path, which led him to the fact that in 1954, after graduating from high school, Ionesyan was caught for theft and sentenced to 5 years conditional imprisonment. In 1959 he was drafted into the army, as he, while studying in the university, had to give up training because of, as he said at the interrogation, \\"a purely nervous illness.\\" When he came to the military registration and enlistment office for an examination, he was sent for examination to the first hospital in Tbilisi, where doctors gave a conclusion that he could not serve. He brought the documents to the military enlistment office, where a certain person, he said, destroyed them, as he was attracted to Ionesyan and did not want him to evade military service. Vladimir was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. At the trial, he tried to prove his innocence, but for some reason the person who destroyed his certificates did not call the court. According to another version of the biography, Ionesyan received the first term for evading military service after school (in which his parents actively helped), because he believed that the service in the army would ruin his vocal talent, and this period was the same for two years. While he was serving his term, his father was arrested. There is also a third version of Ionesyan's biography, set forth in the \\"Komsomolskaya Pravda\\", which brought excerpts from the records of his interrogation. According to these records, he received his first term for evading military service in 1959; on the criminal record from 1954, there was no such thing. After the trial, Ionesyan was sent to a facilitated camp in Gori. There he behaved well and even worked as a cultivator, because of which he was sometimes released into the city. During one dismissal, Ionesyan did not return to the camp, because, unable to restrain himself nervously, he went home. After that, his imprisonment was replaced by one year of forced labor and soon was released. After liberation, Ionesyan was again drafted into the army and again sent to the central neurological dispensary, where he was told he could not serve due to his nervousness. After that, he finally received a military ticket. After a while he married a graduate of the Tbilisi Conservatoire named Medea, and had a son with her. Having failed to find a well-paid job, he decided to engage in group theft, and was arrested. This time, the court, given his age and marital status, gave him 5 years of a suspended sentence. At the request of his wife, who wanted to protect him from communicating with friends and associates, Ionesyan moved to Orenburg, where he began working as a tenor (according to another source - a concertmaster) in the local Musical Comedy Theater. In November 1963, the theater troupe from Kazan came to work with a certain artist along with his wife, who, in turn, was a ballerina named Alevtina Nikolaevna Dmitrieva (b. 1942). The spouse and Dmitrieva settled near the Ionesyan family, and Vladimir and Alevtina soon began a romance. However, the theater management was unhappy with Dmitrieva's work, she was told that she was not suitable for the theater and still had to learn how to dance. As Ionesyan explained during the interrogation, for her this was a serious blow, with Vladimir deciding to help her, as he put it, \\"a very good person in every sense\\" and offered her to go with him to Ivanovo, where he had a friend who was a former director of the Orenburg operetta. For the sake of Dmitrieva, Ionesyan decided to abandon his family and leave the workplace without a remand. Since Dmitrieva was not very interested in him, he lied that he worked for the KGB and, with the help of connections, managed to get a job at the Bolshoi Theatre.–°–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –≤–µ–ª–∏‚Ä¶ It did not work out for the lovers in Ivanovo, and Vladimir began to persuade Alevtina to go to Moscow, telling her that he had an inheritance there, which was left to him from a deceased uncle who lived in Germany. In Moscow, they rented an apartment on Meshchanskaya Street near the Rizhsky railway station from a pensioner, whom they in the first hours of their arrival in the capital. However, there was not enough money to live - Dmitrieva was not taken by any of the capital's theaters - and Ionesyan decided to get money from robberies. He again lied to Alevtina that he had received a promotion and will often be forced to leave for \\"assignments\\". The fact that the \\"KGB agent\\" wore very modest clothes, Ionesyan explained to her that he was \\"under cover\\" and should not stand out. = Motives = As the authorities rushed with the execution, Ionesyan's motives were not set in detail. Officially, the motive in the case was theft, which did not quite fit with Ionesyan's actions, since in half of the cases he did not take really valuable things lying in view and instead took a different trifle, which, in his opinion, could please Dmitrieva, and then gave them to her. Ionesyan's biographers do not have information about a difficult childhood, and, presumably, a detailed study of Ionesyan's childhood to find any factors that could explain his future crimes. During the interrogation, Ionesyan claimed that he was simply looking for money. The first murder he was motivated by the fact that due to a lack of money he was in a neuro-stressful state, but could not explain the reasons for subsequent murders. Researchers in the field of criminology, in particular the well-known anthropologist and sculptor Mikhail Gerasimov, came to the conclusion that Ionesyan belonged to the hysteroid type, and that he committed he crimes for self-affirmation, as he wanted to achieve universal recognition. This is confirmed by the fact that in the Orenburg Musical Comedy Theater Ionesyan, despite his vocal education, played second-class roles, but believed he deserved more. This was the main reason that in 1963 he moved to Moscow - to proven that he deserved better. There is also an opinion that Ionesyan was not a spree killer, for which the killing and suffering of the victims should be the main goal of the crimes, and the robbery, which was his main motive, and he only killed to eliminate witnesses.  Murders  Ionesyan never planned his crimes beforehand. Pretending to be a controller from Mosgaz or an employee of ZhEkA No. 13, he went to apartments, took reading from meters and checked gas burners. While choosing the place of the future robbery, he was guided not so much by the rich decoration of the apartment, but by the number of people in it. As a weapon he used a tourist hatchet, bought from GUM. Oustretched outer detail was the ushanka, which Ionesyan, unlike the overwhelming number of Muscovites, tied at the back of the head, and not on the top, which immediately gave investigators a tip to the fact that the killer is non-resident. Nevertheless, there are cases when Ionesyan put on a kepi instead of an ushanka. = The first victim = Ionesyan committed the first murder on December 20, 1963 in apartment No. 95 on the fourth floor on Baltiskaya Street in the Sokol District. Under the guise of a Mosgaz employee, he walked through several apartments at a time, where he inspected for a convenient victim under the pretext of a preventative inspection of gas equipment. That convenient victim was 12-year-old Konstantin Sobolev. After making sure that there was no one at home, Ionesyan inflicted a large number of blows with the axe on the boy (according to other sources, the killer used a knife, and this was the only time he supposedly used a knife).–ù.–°–∏–∑–æ–≤. –ó–∞–ø—É—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Å–ª–µ–¥ // –ù–µ–≤—ã–¥—É–º–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑—ã.-–ú., 1972 After killing the child, Ionesyan took his sweater, 60 rubles, a bottle of cologne \\"Shipr\\" and beach glasses.–ù. –ú–æ–¥–µ—Å—Ç–æ–≤. –ú–∞–Ω—å—è–∫–∏‚Ä¶ –°–ª–µ–ø–∞—è —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç—å. ‚Äî 1997. After questioning the tenants of the house, the police went to 9-year-old Vladimir Teplov (to protect the witness in all documents, including at court, his name was listed as Artem Frolov). The three-room communal apartment No. 86, located on the second floor, was the first one Ionesyan entered when he was in the house (there were no residential premises on the first floor). Ionesyan, who was there, asked if there was anyone else at home, to which the boy answered mechanically: \\"Everybody is at home\\", although in the apartment, except for him, was only his 70-year-old grandmother and a baby. Probably, because of this, Ionesyan did not attack the boy, but, in hesitation, went into the kitchen and inspected the gas stove, from the handle of which policemen removed the clear fingerprints of his fingers. Teplov's testimony (in particular, that the stranger was slightly hunchbacked, although his Caucasian appearance was not pronounced) played a big role in the work of criminalist Sophia Feinstein, who made a facial composite. To recreate the criminal's appearance, they also sought help from the artist Naum Karpovsky and famous sculptor and anthropologist Mikhail Gerasimov. At some point, while Feinstein was working with Teplov, one of MUR's officers glanced into her office, who coincidentally turned out to be very similar to Ionesyan, which allowed to make a more accurate portrait of the murderer. It was Teplov who first said about the hat of the stranger and how it was tied on the back of the head, which was then not typical for Muscovites and betrayed him as an outsider. Subsequently, Teplov identified the criminal during the investigative experiment and gave a testimony at a closed trial in the Supreme Court of the RSFSR. = Murders in Ivanovo = On December 25, 1963, Ionesyan, together with Dmitrieva, came to Ivanovo, where he committed two murders. Continuing to pretend to be a gas worker, he entered apartments and looked for suitable victims. In an apartment on Kalinin Street he killed a 12-year-old boy named Mikhail Kuleshov with an axe, then stole his jacket, a pullover, two pens and several bonds. In another apartment, on Oktyabrskaya Street, he killed a 74-year-old woman, but only took a pocket flashlight and 70 kopeks from her apartment. Returning to Kalinin Street, he again began to walk around the apartments. In one of them he attacked 15-year- old Galina Petropavlovskaya, who was raped and then struck nine times to the head with the axe. Ionesyan then took a sweater, a jacket, a fluffy shawl and 90 rubles. Despite her injuries, Petropavlovskaya survived and was able to describe her attacker's appearance. In the evening Ionesyan told Dmitrieva that because of the \\"government task\\" he carried out, both of them could be killed, and said it was urgent to leave Ivanovo. They left on foot, walked 10 kilometers towards Moscow and only then took a bus. After the murders in Ivanovo, the case of the \\"Mosgaz Murderer\\" was given special status, and was taken under the personal control by the Minister of Public Order Protection (as it was then called the Ministry of Internal Affairs) Vadim Tikunov and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Alexei Kosygin. Nikita Khrushchev was also interested in the matter. = The fourth murder = On December 28 in Moscow, in an apartment on Leningradsky Avenue, Ionesyan killed 11-year-old Alexander Lisovets. When he struck him first with the axe, the boy ran to the toilet and tried to lock it behind him, but the perpetrator managed to overtake him and killed Alexander in the toilet. Ionesyan did not take anything from the apartment: the door to the room where the cabinet stood was locked, and he could not find the key and crack it. = The last murder = Ionesyan committed his last murder on January 8, 1964 in an apartment on Sheremetyevskaya Street, near the Marina Grove. The victim was 46-year-old Maria Ermakova, to whom he introduced himself as an employee of the housing office. Ionesyan struck her about twenty times with his axe, then took from her apartment five skeins of yarn, three pairs of socks, a purse, 30 rubles, a Mir clock and a Start-3 television set.  Arrest  Several residents of the Marina Grove told the police that they saw how on the day of the murder a young man of southern appearance with a turned off TV in a sheet had left the street in a truck. The district commissioner Malyshev had also seen it, and managed to remember the first digits of the truck's license plate - 96. The detectives quickly learned the full number - MOG 96-26. The driver admitted that he really had driven a man of Caucasian appearance and dropped him off between the Trifonovskaya and Meshchanskaya Streets. Survey of tenants from nearby houses was carried out. A woman who lived on Shchepkina Street reported that her neighbor has a niece with her husband who looks like a Caucasian, had recently brought a TV and immediately sold it to a tenant from a neighboring house. While investigating the tenant, police found out that it was the same TV that disappeared from Ermakova's apartment. Ionesyan's apartment was ambushed, but Alevtina Dmitrieva was detained instead of the murderer himself, telling the detectives that Ionesyan was working for the KGB and is on a secret mission (during the arrest, Ionesyan himself introduced himself as a KGB major). A quick check, led by the then chairman of the KGB, Vladimir Semichastny, showed that Vladimir Ionesyan was not listed. Dmitrieva was put in solitary confinement, and confessed that her cohabitant went to Kazan, where after a while she was supposed to come too. At the station it was Ionesyan who was to meet her \\"on demand\\". As bait, instead of Dmitrieva, they sent a MUR employee instead. Ionesyan's detention was supervised personally by the Minister of Public Order Protection of the Tatar ASSR Salikh Yapeyev. On January 12, 1964, without any difficulties, the murderer, nicknamed \\"Mosgaz\\", was arrested on a platform of the Kazan railway station.  Trial and sentence  In the documentary film from NTV \\"Open, Mosgaz!\\", evidence is provided that Ionesyan talked personally to the General Prosecutor of the USSR Roman Rudenko, who on his behalf took the killer to the office of the then state of head Nikita Khrushchev. According to this version, while looking at Ionesyan, Khrushchev ordered: \\"In order that in two weeks he should no longer be here...\\". Ionesyan's trial was short-lived and was of a closed nature. In fact, the fate of the accused was resolved before the trial. Since his brutal crimes were widely publicized and shocked the public, the Ministry of Public Order Protection proposed that the investigation be completed as soon as possible, that a court be held and the execution sentence be passed to Ionesyan. The correspondence of the police authorities with the Central Committee mentioned the proposal \\"to sentence Ionesyan to death by hanging and for the sentenced to be done publicly.\\" Other, more sophisticated punitive measures were also suggested. First Deputy Chairman of the KGB Philipp Bobkov, while in retirement, mentioned in 2001 that he received letters from citizens and labor collectives, which, in view of the terrible cruelty committed against children, demanded that the criminal be hanged publicly or quartered in Lobnoye Mesto. The plans of the leadership of the CPSU Central Committee, however, did not include a broad coverage of the process, which some workers of this organization also insisted on. At the same time, the nationality of the offender was taken into account, the need to avoid the heat of passion on this sensitive soil. This letter was sent for signature to the heads of the administrative departments of the CPSU Central Committee and Central Committee of the RSFSR, Mironov and Laputin: \\"We believe that the desire to make the upcoming trial sensational is not justified. In our opinion, it would be advisable, in accordance with the law on jurisdiction the Ionesyan case be considered in the Supreme Court of the RSFSR...The trial of the press, radio and television should not be covered, limiting itself to a brief report on the verdict in the central press. The Procuracy of the USSR (Comrade Rudenko) and the Supreme Court of the USSR (Comrade Kulikov) support this proposal. We ask for consent.\\" The investigation and the trial took only two weeks. On January 30, 1964, the Supreme Court of the USSR issued a verdict: the death penalty. In the verdict of the court it was clarified that \\"the verdict is final and can not be appealed.\\" The petition for a pardon was immediately rejected, and on the next day, on January 31, 1964, at 23:00, Vladimir Ionesyan was executed by firing squad at the Butyrka Prison. Alevtina Dmitrieva was recognized as an accomplice, although Ionesyan shielded her during interrogations, claiming that she knew nothing about the murders, and even her fault, according to later testimonies of forensics experts, was not proven by the court. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but later in 1972 (or in 1974) she was released early.

The type and only species is L. mafube, known from a singular incomplete postcranial specimen. A quadruped, it was one of the first giant sauropodomorphs, reaching a weight of around , despite not having evolved columnar limbs like its later huge relatives. Description Ledumahadi was likely a quadruped, as determined by analysis of the circumference of its humerus and femur compared to those of other dinosaurs. It would have had very large, robust forelimbs, consistent with those of its relatives. Unlike those of later sauropods, these limbs were naturally flexed, as opposed to being purely columnar. =Size= Size of Ledumahadi compared to a human At its time in the Early Jurassic epoch, Ledumahadi is thought to have been the largest land animal that had ever lived. It is estimated to have reached a maximum size of around in weight; well over twice any confident weight estimates for a Triassic sauropod (around 3 tonnes, in Camelotia), and still significantly larger than the highest estimates for Lessemsaurus, around 7 tonnes; even early true sauropods, such as Vulcanodon, are not known to have been this large; L. mafube was more comparable to the later sauropod Diplodocus in weight. Classification A phylogenetic analysis of Ledumahadi mafube was performed by McPhee and colleagues, which found it to belong to a recently recognised clade of sauropodiformes called Lessemsauridae, including the closely related South African Antetonitrus and Lessemsaurus from Argentina. Another lessemsaurid described in 2018, Ingentia, could not be included in their analysis but was also recognised as belonging to Lessemsauridae. The results of McPhee and colleagues' analysis are shown in the cladogram below: The size of the taxon was deemed to be important in the wider picture of sauropod evolution, similar to its other lessemsaurid relatives. Living only a few million years after the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, it indicates that this event must have either had only a small effect on body size within the sauropod lineage, or may have not affected it at all. Significance was also found in the magnitude of the size itself‚Äîit lacked the columnar limbs that characterized its more derived relatives, thought to be a key adaptation in body size evolution. Ornithischian dinosaurs reach their largest sizes around a similar size of 12 to 17 tonnes in weight. This may have been the upper limit for dinosaurs without adopting the characteristics found in true sauropods, which grew to be several times the weight of Ledumahadi.

U.S. armed forces radio that had been broadcast to troops stationed nearby during the Vietnam War was also a primary influence. This music scene was abruptly crushed by the Khmer Rouge communists in 1975, and many of its musicians disappeared or were executed during the ensuing Cambodian genocide. Due to its unique sounds and the tragic fate of many of its performers, the Cambodian rock scene has attracted the interest of music historians and record collectors, and the genre gained new popularity upon the international release of numerous compilation albums starting in the late 1990s. Post-independence period The young Norodom Sihanouk fostered Cambodian popular music starting in the 1950s. Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953, under the leadership of young king Norodom Sihanouk.Dommen, A. The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans, Indiana University Press, 2001, p.318 Sihanouk was a musician and songwriter, and fostered the development of homegrown popular music in the newly independent country. Under Sihanouk's rule, it was common for government ministries to have their own orchestras or singing groups to perform at official state functions and royal receptions. For example, Sihanouk's mother, Queen Sisowath Kossamak, sponsored the Vong Phleng Preah Reach Troap (the classical ensemble of the Royal Treasury), and in approximately 1957 invited the young Sinn Sisamouth to join the ensemble as his first professional music job. Cambodia's international relations with France and various countries in Latin America fostered the importation of pop records into the country, while children from wealthy Cambodian families often attended school in France and returned with French pop records that were widely traded among fans in Phnom Penh. French pop singers Sylvie Vartan and Johnny Hallyday were particularly popular.John Pirozzi and LinDa Saphan, liner notes, Don't Think I've Forgotten, soundtrack, 2015. Latin jazz, cha cha cha, and √Ä gogo records imported from Latin America also became popular in the capital city. By the late 1950s, these genres inspired a flourishing pop music scene in Phnom Penh, featuring singers who created a unique sound by combining traditional Cambodian music forms with these new international influences. Sinn Sisamouth, Mao Sareth, So Savoeun, Chhuon Malay, Sieng Di, and Sos Math were among the earliest stars in this pop scene, with Sisamouth in particular becoming a leader of popular trends in which Cambodian musicians absorbed more international influences, eventually leading to the development of Cambodian rock music. By 1959, American and British pop and early rock and roll records began to appear in Cambodia, inspiring teenage fans in particular. That year, teen brothers Mol Kagnol and Mol Kamach formed Baksey Cham Krong, widely considered to be Cambodia's first rock band. The band originally performed crooning vocal music inspired by Paul Anka and Pat Boone, then added inspiration from the guitar-driven music of The Ventures and Chuck Berry. They likened themselves to Cliff Richard and The Shadows, and modeled their stage presence after Richard's 1961 movie The Young Ones. Baksey Cham Krong exerted a wide influence on the Cambodian rock and pop scene, and their popularity inspired older singers like Sinn Sisamouth to add rock songs to their repertoires. Many later Cambodian rock musicians cited the band as a formative influence. Sinn Sisamouth, often called \\"The King of Cambodian Music\\", c. late 1960s. By the mid-1960s, Sinn Sisamouth had become Cambodia's most well-known pop music performer, and his music increasingly incorporated rock music influences, including psychedelic rock and garage rock. By this time, the Cambodian music scene was further influenced by Western rock and soul music via U.S. armed forces radio that had been broadcast to troops stationed nearby during the Vietnam War. Sisamouth fostered the careers of younger singers and musicians, writing songs for them while also utilizing them in many of his own songs. Pen Ran (also known as Pan Ron) was one of the earliest rock-oriented female singers in the Cambodian scene, first emerging in 1963 with traditional pop songs but moving into rock music by 1966 via duets with Sisamouth as well as her own songs.Jeff Cole, liner notes, Cambodia Rock Spectacular!, 2011. Pen Ran was particularly influential, known for her flirtatious dancing and risque lyrics that subverted traditional Khmer gender roles. Sisamouth was also instrumental in launching the career of Ros Serey Sothea, who had been singing at weddings and quickly became the leading female singer in the Cambodian rock scene after her emergence in 1967. Sothea received wide recognition for her high and clear singing voice, and her ability to convey emotions from mischief and flirtation to heartbreak and tragedy. Sothea was also one of many female singers in the rock scene to utilize the traditional \\"ghost voice\\" Cambodian singing technique, featuring a high register with quick jumps among octaves, creating an effect that has been compared to yodeling. This was another factor in the genre's unique sound. Sothea maintained an active career with her own songs as well as many popular duets with Sisamouth. In a reflection of her popularity with the Cambodian people, Sothea was honored by Head of State Norodom Sihanouk with the royal title of Preah Reich Theany Somlang Meas, the \\"Queen with the Golden Voice\\". Sihanouk continued to support the Cambodian music scene through his patronage of the National Radio station, allowing the station to promote local music. A regular rock music show hosted by DJ Huoy Meas was popular with teenagers and college students, making Meas a national celebrity. She became a popular singer as well, known particularly for highly personal lyrics that subverted the social expectations placed on Khmer women, and a melancholic voice that Sihanouk compared to Edith Piaf. The Cambodian rock scene was also notable for its prolific nature, with musicians recording large numbers of songs that were continuously released as singles. For example, Sinn Sisamouth is confirmed to have written more than one thousand songs, and the true total is likely to be much higher. Sisamouth, Ros Serey Sothea, Pen Ran and others also maintained separate music careers concurrently. Their rock n' roll records, which were popular with younger people, were released alongside works in other genres including traditional Cambodian music, romantic ballads, and film music, with those latter genres remaining popular with the country's older music fans. Ros Serey Sothea and Pen Ran are both believed to have sung on hundreds of songs, and Pen Ran wrote many of her songs herself. Khmer Republic period Singer Pen Ran, known for her risque lyrics, c. 1968. By 1969, Norodom Sihanouk had lost the support of many urban and educated Cambodians due to his inability to keep the hostilities of the Vietnam War from spilling across the country's borders. In March 1970, Sihanouk was deposed by the Cambodian National Assembly and replaced by military leader Lon Nol,Burchett (1973), p. 50. thus forming the right-wing, pro-American Khmer Republic. Rock musicians in Phnom Penh generally favored the new Khmer Republic government and turned against Sihanouk, particularly after he attempted to maintain his support in Cambodia's rural countryside by aligning with the communist Khmer Rouge insurgents. Many singers, including Sinn Sisamouth, released patriotic songs and made public appearances to support the Khmer Republic military. Ros Serey Sothea released a song called \\"The Traitor\\" that directly criticized Sihanouk, her former patron. Sothea also directly participated in the Khmer Republic military; a film of her parachuting out of a plane during a paratrooper exercise is the only known video footage of her to have survived. The Khmer Republic's increased relations with the United States, plus the prevalence of U.S. Armed Forces Radio that had been broadcast to troops in nearby South Vietnam and could be picked up in Phnom Penh, allowed new musical influences to infiltrate the Cambodian rock scene. This inspired a diversification in that scene's sounds, fashions, and lyrical content starting in about 1970. For example, singer/guitarist Yol Aularong was influenced by garage rock and specialized in sarcastic lyrics that poked fun at conservative Cambodian society. Aularong has been described as a \\"proto-punk\\" by the New York Times. Additional examples of this new wave of Cambodian rock musicians include Meas Samon, who combined the showmanship of a comedian with satirical lyrics and psychedelic rock sounds. Liev Tuk adopted American soul and funk, with a belting vocal style that has been compared to Wilson Pickett and James Brown. Pou Vannary, unusually for a female singer in the genre, was also an instrumentalist who could accompany herself on acoustic guitar in the mode of an American singer-songwriter, displaying a vocal style that was much more relaxed and intimate than her contemporaries. The self-contained band Drakkar played hard rock music that has been compared to Santana and Led Zeppelin. These musicians also adopted hippie hairstyles and fashions, as further indicators of American influence in Cambodia at the time. This latest wave of rock musicians, plus established stars like Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Serey Sothea, continued their music careers throughout the early 1970s. However, the Cambodian Civil War took its toll on the country, as did American bombing campaigns associated with the Vietnam War. Due to wartime curfews, musicians often had to play in clubs during the day and often heard nearby gunfire and explosions during their performances. The Cambodian rock scene persevered in this fashion until the fall of the Khmer Republic in April 1975. Khmer Rouge period and the Cambodian genocide The Cambodian Civil War ended in April 1975 when the communist Khmer Rouge defeated the Khmer Republic and gained control of the country. The Khmer Rouge ordered the two million residents of Phnom Penh to evacuate the city and move to prison farms and labor camps, The city's musicians were included in this forced exodus. The Khmer Rouge regime, led by Pol Pot, wanted to return the nation of Cambodia to an idyllic notion of the past by implementing a radical form of agrarian socialism while simultaneously shunning outside aid and influence. In order to build and protect their utopian goals, the Khmer Rouge perceived enmity in anyone tied to the previous Cambodian governments, ethnic and religious minorities, intellectuals, and members of certain professions. In the ensuing Cambodian genocide, about 25 percent of the Cambodian population perished. More than half of those who died during the genocide are believed to have been directly executed. The rest died through forced labor, malnutrition, and disease due to the Khmer Rouge's cruelty and poor management of its utopian project. Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge targeted musicians during the Cambodian genocide. Musicians posed an apparent threat to the Khmer Rouge regime due to their influence on culture, incompatibility with an agrarian lifestyle, and foreign influences. Many of Cambodia's rock musicians disappeared during the genocide and their exact fates have never been confirmed. Due to these musicians' enduring popularity with the Cambodian people, reports differ on how some of them died. Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Serey Sothea are both believed to have been summarily executed by Khmer Rouge soldiers out of fear that their popularity could foment resistance among the population. However, these reports have never been confirmed. Meas Samon is believed to have been executed at a work site after refusing to stop playing music during breaks. Other musicians like Pen Ran, Yol Aularong, and Pou Vannary simply disappeared sometime between 1975 and 1979 with no information available about their fates, as is the case with most of the ordinary Cambodians who perished during the genocide. Some Cambodian rock musicians survived the genocide through various hardships. For example, Drakkar guitarist Touch Chhatha was among many professional musicians who were forced to play traditional and patriotic music every day to Khmer Rouge troops. Chhatha's bandmate Touch Seang Tana survived several years' imprisonment at a work camp by pretending to be a common peasant. During the Khmer Rouge takeover of Phnom Penh, singer Sieng Vannthy was confronted by insurgents who demanded to know her occupation. She lied and said she was a banana seller, which probably saved her life as the Khmer Rouge were already known to target musicians for imprisonment or execution. As with many other aspects of pre-Khmer Rouge Cambodian culture, much of the country's rock music and information about the musicians was lost during the chaos of the regime. In their attempt to \\"purify\\" Cambodian society and culture, Khmer Rouge soldiers were known to destroy records and master tapes containing any Western-influenced music genres, and often forced residents to burn their record collections. The only Cambodian rock records to survive were the few that citizens managed to hide in personal collections, and many of those were damaged to the point at which artist names or song titles had been lost. Therefore, except for fans' personal memories, much of the 1960s‚Äì1970s rock music of Cambodia was lost until it was slowly rediscovered starting in the 1990s. Relations between the Khmer Rouge regime and neighboring Vietnam collapsed in late 1978, igniting the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War. Vietnam launched a full-scale military invasion of Cambodia in December 1978\\"1978-1979 - Vietnamese Invasion of Cambodia\\", Globalsecurity.com and captured Phnom Penh the following month, thus ending the Khmer Rouge regime and the Cambodian genocide. Vietnamese forces sent the Khmer Rouge into exile in Thailand and installed Heng Samrin as the new leader of the restored Cambodia. Residents who had been exiled to farm camps and other Khmer Rouge installations were invited to return to Phnom Penh. Singer Sieng Vannthy, who had survived the genocide, was invited to make an announcement on Cambodia's National Radio station that residents were welcome to return to the city. Those who did not return were considered dead, including musicians. Rediscovery After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, surviving Cambodian rock musicians regrouped and attempted to locate missing colleagues. Many musicians contacted Ros Saboeut, older sister of Ros Serey Sothea, to inquire about Sothea's fate. Sothea did not survive the genocide but Saboeut took the opportunity to reunite Cambodia's surviving rock musicians, maintaining a list of contacts. Saboeut's efforts are widely credited with reviving Cambodian popular music in the aftermath of the genocide. According to Youk Chhang, the executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, Saboeut sought to restore Cambodian music as a tribute to her sister, saying \\"I think she was bound by the legacy of her sister to help.\\" As with all other aspects of Cambodian society and culture, the country's music scene faced a tough but relatively fast recovery. The post-Khmer Rouge government made specific moves to re-establish the country's radio industry, allowing surviving singers and musicians to resume their careers by creating new entertainment content. For example, Drakkar drummer Ouk Sam Art and guitarist Touch Chhatha were able to return to music work at Cambodia's National Radio station. The Cambodian music scene moved on to more modern pop forms, consigning the country's 1960s‚Äì1970s rock music to the memories of older fans who had survived the genocide. In the ensuing years, fans of Cambodian rock music found and reproduced the few records and master tapes that survived the chaos of the Khmer Rouge regime. A black market in remixed and reprinted works by popular but now-deceased (and some still- living) musicians developed, with little regard for intellectual property rights, which were not enforced in Cambodia until 2003. Black marketeers were known to remix songs by artists like Ros Serey Sothea and Pen Ran to make them more dance-able for current music fans, often with unknown musicians adding stronger drum beats and other effects; some songs were also artificially sped up so more could be squeezed onto inexpensive cassettes to be sold on the street. This unauthorized marketplace allowed Cambodian rock songs to remain popular well into the 1990s; original and authentic master recordings are highly sought by collectors and preservationists, though few are known to have survived the Khmer Rouge regime. Siem Reap, where an American tourist discovered Cambodian rock music in the 1990s. The Cambodian rock genre of the 1960s‚Äì1970s remained largely unknown to the outside world until the late 1990s. While on a tourist trip to Cambodia in 1994, American Paul Wheeler became interested in music he had been hearing around Siem Reap. He purchased some unmarked cassettes from a market vendor and assembled a mixtape of his favorite tracks. The Parallel World label, upon hearing Wheeler's mixtape, assembled the 13-track compilation album Cambodian Rocks and released 1,000 copies on vinyl in 1996. When those sold out, the label issued the much more widely known CD version with 22 tracks. Wheeler made no effort to discover the song titles or the names of the artists, and Cambodian Rocks was released with no supporting information, thus giving it the appearance of a bootleg. In the years since the CD's release, interested listeners have collaborated on the Internet to confirm the artist names and song titles, discovering that ten of the album's 22 songs were by Ros Serey Sothea, with other tracks by Sinn Sisamouth, Pen Ran, Yol Aularong, Meas Samon, and Liev Tuk. Cambodian Rocks was widely praised by the Western rock community. Rolling Stone called it \\"a marvel of cultural appropriation,\\" and Far East Audio called it an \\"instant classic.\\" Further illustrating the unique nature of the music to Western ears, writer Nick Hanover called the album \\"a continuous surprise, a fusion of elements that should be contradictory but somehow strike a balance of West and East.\\" The New York Times said the album and the circumstances of its release \\"established a lasting aura of mystery around the music.\\" Cambodian Rocks was the first release of its kind, followed by a number of similar compilations like Cambodian Cassette Archives and others with similar titles. The 2002 film City of Ghosts, a crime thriller that takes place in Cambodia, featured songs by Sinn Sisamouth, Pen Ran, Ros Serey Sothea, Meas Samon, and Chhuon Malay on its soundtrack. American filmmaker John Pirozzi, a production assistant for City of Ghosts, was given a copy of Cambodian Rocks while working in the country and decided to research the musicians on the album and their fates at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. His research ultimately resulted in the 2015 film Don't Think I've Forgotten, which was named after a Sinn Sisamouth song. Pirozzi's first film project on Cambodian rock music was the 2009 documentary Sleepwalking Through the Mekong that covered a 2005 Cambodian tour by the band Dengue Fever. The film finds that the 1960s‚Äì1970s Cambodian rock music played by the band was still popular with the country's people, and fans were interested in seeing a mostly American band perform the songs.Synopsis , Sleepwalking Through The Mekong (2007 documentary about Dengue Fever) Dengue Fever also released a non-profit compilation of 1960s‚Äì1970s Cambodian rock songs called Electric Cambodia in 2010. After ten years of research in conjunction with Cambodian-born artist and sociology professor LinDa Saphan, Pirozzi completed the documentary Don't Think I've Forgotten in 2015, featuring in-depth profiles of many of the Cambodian rock scene's most influential performers. The film received almost universally positive reviews, further igniting worldwide interest in the Cambodian rock music scene. The film's international release inspired reunion concerts by surviving members of Drakkar, and concerts celebrating the legacy of Sinn Sisamouth and his contemporaries. The film's soundtrack album contained many professionally restored songs that had not been available on other compilations, including some by rarely compiled artists like Baksey Cham Krong, Pou Vannary, Huoy Meas, and Sieng Vannthy. Legacy and influence Singer Chhom Nimol and drummer Paul Smith of the Cambodian-American band Dengue Fever. The Cambodian Rocks album and similar compilations are believed to have inspired the formation of several modern bands who perform cover versions of original Cambodian rock songs and create new music based on that genre. For example, in the late 1990s American rock keyboardist Ethan Holtzman discovered the genre while traveling in Cambodia, and his guitarist brother Zac Holtzman had coincidentally discovered the same music while working at a California record store. In 2001, the brothers formed the band Dengue Fever with Cambodian-born Chhom Nimol, who had previously been a well-known singer in her native country before emigrating to the United States. Dengue Fever first performed covers of original Cambodian rock songs discovered by the Holtzman brothers, but have since released several albums of original material inspired by the genre. Meanwhile, the band Cambodian Space Project was formed in 2009 in Cambodia by singer Kak Channthy and Australian enthusiast Julien Poulson; that band released five albums of covers of 1960s‚Äì1970s Cambodian rock songs and original songs inspired by the genre. Cambodian Space Project disbanded in March 2018 when Channthy was killed in a car accident. The Cambodian rock scene of the 1960s‚Äì1970s has also become a matter of interest to record collectors around the world, while specialists like Dust-to-Digital have embarked on projects to locate and restore surviving records. In addition to enthusiasts like Dengue Fever, other western musicians have become fans of the genre. One example is hip-hop songwriter/producer Danger Mouse, who noted \\"There were these groups... who took Beatles songs and whatever else, put their own lyrics in and called it whatever they wanted to. [...] It sounds like nothing you've ever heard.\\" Cambodian-American singer Bochan Huy is one of a new generation of musicians from that culture who are revisiting 1960s‚Äì1970s Cambodian rock with the goal of preserving the music and addressing its troubled history.  Notable artists  The Cambodian rock scene of the 1960s‚Äì1970s was very robust, with hundreds of active performers. Information on many of them remains lost after the chaos of the Khmer Rouge regime, while some others remain to be discovered by Western journalists and enthusiasts.

The park opened in 1912 to celebrate the reign of Queen Victoria, the gates erected for the opening are listed with Historic England. There is a bandstand surrounded by nine cannons and facilities including rugby and cricket. History The park opened in 1912 to celebrate Queen Victoria's reign.http://www.thenorthdevonfocus.co.uk/Victoria%20Park.htm In 1944 an oak tree was planted to celebrate the good relations between the people of Bideford and US Army personnel who were stationed in the town between 1940-1944. Rose beds were dedicated to Princess Diana after her burial and in 2000 a Millennium Time Capsule was put in the ground near the entrance. Landmarks The gates and gate piers at the entrance to the park are Grade II listed with Historic England. They were erected in 1912 for the opening of the park and have scrollwork and foliage. In the centre of each gate there is a cartouche showing the borough insignia. On the East pier there is a plaque noting the opening of the park on 9 November 1912 and saying the gates were given by Geo. Oliver Peard in memory of his wife. The bandstand is surrounded by nine 16th century cannons. Richard Grenville after being in a ship battle in 1585 captured a Spanish ship called the Santa Maria de Vincente, which he took to Bideford and converted into an English ship called Galleon Dudley. The cannons from Santa Maria de San Vicente were discovered by the quayside of Bideford in 1895. They were later placed in the park and erroneously labelled 'Armada cannons'. The Galleon Dudley saw action against the Spanish Armada but the Santa Maria de Vincente cannons did not.

She was the daughter of a wealthy cotton farmer and slaveholder in the Southern United States. She is remembered in American history and literature for her diary, Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone, 1861-1865, edited by John Q. Anderson, which she kept during the time of the American Civil War, printed in 1955, which she kept continuously from May 1861 to November 1865; shorter supplements date from 1867 and 1868. In addition to the diaries of two other ladies of the upper southern society, Mary Boykin Chesnut and Sarah Morgan, Stone's journal since its first publication has often been used by historians to illustrate the Southern world. Early years and education Sarah Katherine Stone was born January 8, 1841, in Mississippi Springs, Hinds County, Mississippi. In 1861, the year the war broke out, Stone was twenty years old and a fairly typical example of a Southern belle, seeking to meet the usual expectations of a debutante of Southern society. She was one of seven surviving children of the cotton planter William Patrick Stone, who moved the family to Stonington Plantation near Delta, Louisiana, and died in 1855. After her mother, Amanda Susan Ragan Stone, became widowed, she purchased and managed the plantation called \\"Brokenburn\\", and its 150 slaves; it was located in northeastern Louisiana, not far from the city of Vicksburg, Mississippi. She graduated from Stephen Elliott's academy in Nashville, Tennessee. Career In May 1861, a month after the outbreak of the war, Stone began to keep a diary that, as an \\"ego document\\", provides insights into her own sensitivities and looks at her social environment, providing a revealing moral portrait of her time. Stone supported the cause of the Southern States with a youthful-romantic enthusiasm, even though the picture of just war, in which \\"dashing young officers in magnificent uniforms are inspired by patriotic maidens to heroic exploits,\\"Anderson: Introduction zu Brokenburn, S. xvii gave way to cruel reality how the front approached their homeland. In 1862, after the Union's first gunboats took up position on the banks of the Mississippi River just a few miles from their plantation, the skirmishes in the area increased with the Vicksburg campaign, leaving the family in March 1863 for a daring escape through the swamps of Louisiana forced to look. As refugees, the Stones reached Tyler, Texas, where they spent two and a half years - much to the disfavor of the spoiled Kate Stone, who disliked anything but refined Texan manners. In this \\"dark corner of the Confederacy,\\" as Stone calls it, she received news of the deaths of her brothers Walter and Coleman on the battlefield, further eclipsing her mood. After the defeat of the Southern Confederation, Stone returned in 1865 to Louisiana and found the family mansion looted and the plantation devastated. With the difficult reconstruction, the entries become rarer; the diary ends in 1868. Personal life She was affiliated with the Madison Infantry Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Madison Parish Book Club. In 1869, she married Lieutenant Henry Bry Holmes, at Walton Bend Plantation, near Yazoo City, Mississippi. They had four children, Emmet, William, and twins Katy Bry and Amanda Julia. She died December 28, 1907, in Tallulah, Louisiana. References =Bibliography=   * Wilson, Edmund: Patriotic Gore: Studies in the Literature of the American Civil War.

Johannes von der M√ºhll-Faesch (1754-1815) by Nicholas LeJeune, Basel, 1778. Von der M√ºhll or Von der M√ºhl is a Swiss patrician (see the Daig of Basel) and noble family. From the 18th century, with a few other patrician families in Basel (Merian, Burckhardt, Faesch, Vischer), the Von der M√ºhll family dominated the city of Basel's political, economic and social life. The coat of arms of the Von der M√ºhll family is a shield in or (gold), set with 3 fer de moline sable (three black mill irons). The crest is an eagle sable (black eagle) in flight, its beak and talons in gold.  History  The family probably originated from Moulins, France, in the 12th century. In the 15th century a branch emigrated to Delft, from where Johannes fled in the 16th century for confessional reasons. A religious refugee in Herborn (Hessen), he is mentioned there as a linen merchant and mayor in 1561. His son, Christoffel (Stoffel), was a banker and linen merchant in Herborn. Christoffel's son, Johannes, was the house-master and chamberlain of the princes of the House of Orange-Nassau in Dillenburg. The family coat of arms still appears today on the frontispiece of the town hall in Herborn, and was restored in 2016. The coat of arms of the family Von der M√ºhll on the facade of the town hall of Herborn in Hessen, Germany. Johannes' great-grandsons, Hans Georg (1648-1727) and Johann Valentin (1656-1732), came to Basel, Switzerland, in 1674 to work as saddlers and shoemakers, eventually becoming masters of their trade. The still existing Basel branch descends from Hans Georg, who became burgher of Basel in 1681. He sat on the Grand Council of Basel and became secretary of the Zunft zum Himmel in 1690. His son, Johannes von der M√ºhll-Burckhardt (1695-1774), was Gerischtsherr and turned to the silk trade, the family company later becoming Von der M√ºhll & S√∂hne, then Von der M√ºhll & Cie. In 1899, Von der M√ºhll & Cie merged with Kern Sohn & Cie. and F. U. Bally S√∂hne to form the Gesellschaft f√ºr Bandfabrikation. The new stock joint company produced ribbons, sewing threads and traded in silk until 1930, when it finally closed. Hans Georg von der M√ºhll-Gemuseus (1725-1783), son of Johannes, was master of the Zunft des Hausgenossen from 1777 until his death in 1784 and was the first representative of the family to sit on the Small Council of Basel. Johannes von der M√ºhll-Faesch (1754-1815), son of Hans Georg, was elected president of the city of Basel under the Swiss Confederation in 1805. Johann Georg von der M√ºhll-Burckhardt (1789-1853), nephew of Johannes, was in 1814 one of the founders of the trading, shipping and banking company Burckhardt & Von der M√ºhll. From 1816 to 1847, he was a member of the Grand Council of Basel, where he specifically campaigned for the introduction of progressive income tax on revenue. This so-called \\"Basel system\\", introduced in Basel in 1840, quickly became a model for other cantons. A self taught architect, he designed the Basel Sommercasino, built in 1824. From the 17th century, the Von der M√ºhll family intermarried with the other leading families of the Basel patriciate (Burckhardt, Faesch, Hoffmann, Merian, Sarasin, Staehelin, Vischer). alt= In the 19th century, the family became patrons to various causes, and in particular housed Clara Schumann on several of her visits to Switzerland and later the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, who dedicated a poem to Theodora von der M√ºhll-Burckhardt, sister of Carl Jacob Burckhardt. Elisabeth von der M√ºhll-Staehelin (1882‚Äì1970) married Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche in 1919, the founder of Hoffmann-La Roche.

The farm was condemned by the county in April 1972. The family was offered $73,800 to sell the land for future developments including the Oxboro Library.

The Oldbury Branch Railway was a short branch line which ran from Langley Green on the Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster line to the town of Oldbury. It also served the Oldbury Division of the manufacturing company, Albright and Wilson. It was owned and operated by the Great Western Railway. Opening The Dudley and Oldbury Junction Railway was incorporated on 21 July 1873 for a line from Langley Green, Dudley to Halesowen; there were also to be two branches. The company entered into a working agreement with the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1876, and on 11 August 1881 the name was altered to the Oldbury Railway. The line was opened for goods in 1884, and to passengers the following year; services were operated by the GWR under the working agreement of 1876. The Oldbury Railway was fully absorbed by the GWR following an Act of 31 July 1894. The line was built in 1885 by the Great Western Railway and was built on a short stub of line near the present day, Halesowen Street. There was also a goods yard on an embankment via a bridge on Seven Stars Road, a short distance north of the station. Closure The station at Oldbury had a very short lifespan, closing in 1916 as a result of the first world war and never reopened, although the line remained in use for goods traffic to the local factories until 1960s when the section from Albright and Wilson Oldbury Division to the site of Oldbury was severed by the building of the M5 Motorway. This meant the stub north had been closed but the section near Langley Green remained open for freight traffic until the 1980s/90s when the entire line was put out of use. Present Day Today, the station site at Oldbury has been redeveloped for both industrial use near the former goods yard and the station site is now a Mecca Bingo hall. The trackbed to Tat Bank Road near the former Albright and Wilson Oldbury Division has been blocked by the M5 Viaduct and the section built on by both housing and road realignments.

He stood unsuccessfully at Woodstock at the 1705 English general election and was elected MP for Oxford at a by- election on 11 December 1706. He was returned unopposed there at the 1708 British general election. He was one of a group of wine-bibbing Tories who came together under the Duke of Beaufort's lead in July 1709 to establish the ‚ÄòBoard of Brothers‚Äô. He was a High Church supporter of Dr Sacheverell, and voted against his impeachment early in 1710. At the 1710 British general election he was returned again for Oxford, and was listed as a ‚Äòworthy patriot‚Äô who assisted in exposing the mismanagements of the previous Whig administration, and in 1711 as a ‚ÄòTory patriot‚Äô opposed to the continuance of war. In 1711 he was appointed Clerk of the Green Cloth and held the post until 1714. He was returned unopposed for Oxford again at the 1713 British general election. He was returned unopposed as a Tory for Oxford in 1715 and 1722. He voted against the Administration in every recorded division Private life Walter was a bon viveur who enjoyed drinking (particularly fine French wines), smart fashion, gambling and horse racing and was a popular socialite. His friend Jonathan Swift described him as ‚Äùan honest drunken fellow‚Äù. However his extravagance forced him to sell off property to pay his debts. He sold Godstow to the Earl of Abingdon in 1702, most of Cutteslowe to William Breach in 1703, and the remainder of Cutteslowe and Wolvercote to the Duke of Marlborough in 1710. Walter died on 11 June 1722 and was buried at Sarsden. His marriage had been childless and he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his half-brother Robert. He left the Sarsden estate to his wife with reversion to Robert upon her death. He also left ¬£1,000 to his friend Lord Harcourt who in 1724 married Walter's widow. The baronetcy became extinct in 1731 when Sir Robert died childless, and the estate then became caught up in a protracted Chancery suit.

Tritaea or Tritaia () was a polis (city-state) of Achaea, and the most inland of the 12 Achaean cities, was distant 120 stadia from Pharae. According Pausanias, Tritaea's foundation was said to be due to either: Celbidas, who came from Cumae; or Melanippus, a son of Ares and Triteia, herself a daughter of Triton and priestess of Athena, and that Melanippus named the town after his mother. It was one of the four cities that took the lead in reviving the Achaean League during the 124th Olympiad (). In the Social War it suffered from the attacks of the Aetolians and Eleians. Its territory was annexed to Patrae by Augustus, when he made the latter city a colony after the Battle of Actium. et seq.}} Tritaea was home to Agesarchus of Tritaea, an Olympic victor around 120 BCE, whose statue graced Olympia. Highlights of Pausanias's visit in the 2nd century included a white marble tomb with paintings by Nicias in the vicinity of the city. Also in the city there was a sanctuary of the gods, with images of clay and in honour of which an annual feast was celebrated, and also a temple of Athena with a stone image that had replaced another that the Romans had taken to Rome. There sacrifices were celebrated to Ares and to Triteia. In Triteia there was a sanctuary of the gods called Almighty (ŒúŒµŒ≥ŒØœÉœÑœâŒΩ Œ∏Œµ·ø∂ŒΩ), and their statues in the sanctuary were made of clay. In honor of these gods every year a festival was held.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 7.22.9 The site of Tritaea is located at modern Agia Marina.

He passed his PhD in 1980 and his Doctorat d'√âtat (State doctorate) in 1985, both in the University of Montpellier, under the supervision of Professors Xavier Mattei and Louis Euzet. From 1978 to 1985, Justine was Assistant then Ma√Ætre-Assistant (Assistant Professor) at the University of Dakar, Senegal. He entered the National Museum of Natural History (MNHN) in 1985 to join, as Ma√Ætre-Assistant (Assistant Professor) the laboratory directed at that time by Professor Alain Chabaud. He is a member of the MNHN since, and a full Professor since 1995, but spent several years (2003-2011) as visiting scholar in Noum√©a, New Caledonia. Justine is the curator of the parasitic worms in the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, France, and, since 2013, a deputy-director the Institute of Systematics, Evolution and Biodiversity (ISYEB), one of the largest units in the MNHN. He is also a member of the EASIN (European Alien Species Information Network) Editorial Board since 2015 and the Editor-in-Chief of the journal Parasite since 2012. Research Drawings of spermatozoa from a paper authored by Justine Justine has worked on several fields during his career. His early research and his theses were about sperm ultrastructure in parasitic flatworms and its use for phylogeny. He then worked on systematics of nematodes, monogeneans and other parasites, especially the species from coral reef fish. Justine has published more than 250 papers since 1981 and described more than one hundred new species, which are all parasitic animals belonging mainly to the Nematoda and Monogenea, and also Digenea, Cestoda, and Crustacea. After 2013, Justine undertook a research about invasive land planarians, such as Platydemus manokwari. The papers issued from this research had some impact on the media, including French radios, televisions and newspapers, and newspapers and media from the USA, UK and other countries. Editing activities Justine has been the Editor-in- chief of the M√©moires du Mus√©um National d‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle, from 1992 to 1998, and of Zoosystema, a journal of zoology, from 1998 to 2002; both are journals published by the National Museum of Natural History in Paris.

A concept album and sequel to the band's fourth album Chronometree (2000), it features the same character, Tom Timely, now struggling to reach success with his progressive rock band The Elf King in the eighties. It was conceived as a stand-alone story rather than a direct continuation of the earlier album.  Story  The album follows Tom Timely in the 1980s, after the events of Chronometree. Now the member of a progressive rock band named The Elf King. Together with his bandmates, which include guitarist Dwight -who often misses rehearsals- and vocalist Arianna, Tom tries to reach success and become a \\"prog god\\"; the story also involves him travelling back in the time to the golden age of progressive rock in the 1970s, and going missing.  Reception  Progradar stated \\"Glass Hammer make a bold new statement with Chronomonaut‚Äô, a new direction that gives them a definitive sound of their own. [...] While not completely straying from their roots, Glass Hammer have taken a path less trodden and delivered what is, without a doubt, their best album yet and a fantastic new direction of power, precision and downright soul.\\" Roie Avin of The Prog Report called the album \\"a progressive psychedelic trip with a captivating story and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing throughout. 25 years into their career Glass Hammer continue to take risks and the result here is another gem in their impressive catalog.\\" Brad Birzer of Progarchy stated \\"I could review this as a distinctive piece of American culture and Americana; as a treasure hunt and quest; as a progressive rock album; as a philosophical examination of nostalgia; as a theological pondering on the nature of time; or as a fully- blown science fiction tale worthy of anything written by Robert Heinlein or Kevin J. Anderson. In some way, no review of this album can really be faithful to the material if it doesn‚Äôt take into account all of these things.\\", and called Chronomonaut \\"a majestic album that calls forth all that is best within us.

Completed in mid-1944, the boat was assigned to convoy escort duties and supporting German forces in the Baltic. On 18 August 1944, a navigational error led her to enter a German minefield as she was preparing to lay another minefield in the Gulf of Finland off the Estonian coast. T32 struck two mines that crippled her. She was sunk by Soviet aircraft with the loss of 137 crewmen later that morning. Design and description The Type 39 torpedo boat was conceived as a general-purpose design, much larger than preceding German torpedo boats.Whitley 1991, p. 52 The boats had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. They had a beam of , a draft of at deep load and displaced at standard load and at deep load.Gr√∂ner, p. 195 Their crew numbered 206 officers and sailors.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 239 The Type 39s were fitted with a pair of geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller, using steam from four high-pressure water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce which was intended give the ships a maximum speed of . They carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at .Whitley 1991, pp. 54, 203 As built, the Type 39 ships mounted four SK C/32 guns in single mounts protected by gun shields; one forward of the superstructure, one between the funnels, and two aft, one superfiring over the other. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by four SK C/30 AA guns in two twin-gun mounts on platforms abaft the rear funnel and a dozen C/38 guns. One quadruple mount was positioned on the aft superstructure and two more were fitted on the bridge wings. They carried six above-water torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry 30 mines; the full complement of 60 mines made the ships top-heavy which could be dangerous in bad weather. For anti-submarine work the boats were fitted with a S-Ger√§t sonar and four depth charge launchers. The Type 39s were equipped with a FuMO 21 radar and various FumB radar detectors were installed late in the war.Friedman, p. 205; Whitley 1991, pp. 52‚Äì55; Whitley 2000, p. 73 Construction and career T32 was ordered on 20 January 1941 from Schichau, laid down at their Elbing, East Prussia, shipyard on 27 October 1942 as yard number 1514, launched on 17 April 1943 and commissioned on 8 May 1944. Working up until August, T32 was then assigned to the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla operating in the Baltic. The flotilla, consisting of T32 as the flotilla leader, and her sisters T22 and T30, was tasked to lay a minefield in Narva Bay on the night of 17/18 August. Reinforced by their sister T23 from the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, the boats loaded 54 mines in Helsinki, Finland, and departed on the evening of the 17th. Shortly after midnight, they started to lay their mines, but had only just begun when T30 struck a pair of mines about 00:25 which knocked out her power and gave her a list to port. About a minute after that T32 also struck a pair of mines that blew her bow off and disabled her engines. At 00:30 T30 exploded and broke in half, probably after hitting another mine. T22 struck a pair of mines while maneuvering to go alongside T32 and blew up at around 01:14. The Germans thought that she had been torpedoed by the Soviet motor torpedo boats that they believed were present and T23s captain ordered his boat to leave the area without rescuing any of the survivors in the water or aboard T32.Rohwer, p. 338; Whitley 1991, pp. 175‚Äì179, 212 The ship was sunk by Soviet aircraft after dawn at with the loss of 137 crewmen after T23s departure.Gr√∂ner, p. 195 The Soviets never claimed to have torpedoed any of the boats that night and naval historian Michael J. Whitley believes that the most likely explanation is that they accidentally entered a nearby German minefield, either through their own errors in navigation or because the minefield was misplotted when laid.Whitley 1991, pp. 179‚Äì180 Notes Citations References    External links * T32 at german navy.de Category:Type 39 torpedo boats Category:1943 ships Category:Ships built by Schichau Category:Ships built in Elbing Category:Maritime incidents in August 1944 ","title":"German torpedo boat T32"},{"id":"58595453","text":"An American Pickle is a 2020 American comedy-drama film directed by Brandon Trost (in his solo directorial debut) and written by Simon Rich, based on his 2013 short story \\"Sell Out\\". The film stars Seth Rogen as an Eastern European Jewish immigrant who gets preserved in a vat of pickles and wakes up in modern-day New York City, attempting to fit in with the assistance of his last remaining descendant (also played by Rogen); Sarah Snook also stars. Originally intended to be released by Sony Pictures, the film's rights were sold to Warner Bros. in April 2020. It was digitally released in the United States on August 6, 2020, the first original film released by HBO Max, and theatrically in the United Kingdom the following day. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with Rogen's dual performance being praised. Plot Herschel Greenbaum, and his spouse, Sarah Greenbaum, are struggling Jewish laborers. They emigrate from their shtetl to America in 1919 after their village is rampaged by Russian Cossacks. Herschel finds a job at a pickle factory, and is able to save up for two graves at a Jewish cemetery. One day, while working at his job, he falls into a vat of pickles as the factory is closed and he is brined for 100 years. Having woken up in Brooklyn, 2019, Herschel discovers that his only living relative is his great grandson Ben. Ben works as a freelance app developer and is currently developing his own app \\"Boop Bop\\", a service that checks companies' ethics when buying their products. Ben reluctantly agrees to go with Herschel to the cemetery where Sarah and his son are buried, along with Ben's parents. Herschel is disgusted to find that the cemetery was left in shambles, along with a Russian vodka billboard overlooking it. This causes him to assault the construction workers putting up the billboard, leading to his and Ben's arrest. Ben is able to bail them out of jail; however, he is now unable to get investors for his app due to his new criminal record, causing him to disown Herschel. Herschel decides to begin a pickle business in order to buy and take down the billboard overlooking the cemetery. Herschel's business is a huge success over social media. However, Ben tells health inspectors that Herschel has been using produce found in the trash bins, causing him to be charged $12,000. Herschel is able to come back from this with the assistance of unpaid interns, causing his business to become even more popular and allowing him to refurbish the cemetery and remove the billboard. Herschel's success leads to Ben envying him even more. Ben then tells Herschel to download Twitter, and he begins tweeting controversial statements. While initially met with protests and boycotts, Herschel is then seen as an icon of free speech and empowerment. While Herschel is hosting a friendly debate, Ben shows up and questions his thoughts on Christianity. This leads to a rant about Christianity, causing Herschel to become despised by the public. His immigration files are also not to be found, causing the government to try and deport him. Herschel arrives at Ben's apartment, and Ben reluctantly agrees to help him get to the Canadian border. Through this, Ben and Herschel begin to reconcile their relationship. However, Ben admits that he tried to sabotage Herschel's business, causing Herschel to admit that he is disappointed that Ben is more committed to his app than his family's legacy, leading to a physical fight between the two. Herschel is able to steal Ben's backpack, and uses his razor to shave and puts on his clothes to pose as Ben, alerting the police that the real Ben is Herschel. This causes the real Ben's arrest and deportation. While at Ben's apartment, Herschel discovers that the app's name, \\"Boop Bop\\", was actually the nickname Ben gave his late parents, leading Herschel to realize that family was always in Ben's heart. He returns to his home country to find Ben, who is staying at a local synagogue. They reconcile, and sometime later return to Brooklyn, hoping to develop a pickle-selling website.

On May 29, 2013, it was announced that Sony Pictures had acquired the screen rights to the short story Sell Out by Rich. Producers were set to consist of Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and James Weaver, while Rich was expected to serve as an executive producer. Production companies involved with the film were slated to include Point Grey Pictures. On September 27, 2018, it was announced that Brandon Trost was attached to direct the film, that Rich would write the film, and that additional producers now included Alexandria McAtee. Alongside the directing announcement, it was confirmed that the film would star Rogen. On November 26, 2018, it was announced that Maya Erskine, Sarah Snook, Eliot Glazer, Kalen Allen, Molly Evensen, and Kevin O'Rourke had joined the cast (although Erskine ultimately did not appear in the film). Principal photography took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from October 29 to December 22, 2018; Pittsburgh being a fitting locale for filming due to the longtime presence of locally-based H.J. Heinz Company and the company's long association with pickles, including the Heinz pickle pin. Music Nami Melumad has been set to compose the music while Michael Giacchino was tasked to write the themes for the film, including a suite titled \\"Pickles, Suite or Sour.\\"http://filmmusicreporter.com/2020/08/06/an-american-pickle-soundtrack- to-be-released/ Release On April 27, 2020, it was announced Warner Bros. had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film from Sony Pictures. It was digitally released in the United States on HBO Max and Canada on VOD partner Crave on August 6, 2020, and theatrically in the United Kingdom the following day. The film made $36,194 from 162 theaters in its UK debut, finishing fourth at the box office.  Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 152 reviews, with an average rating of 6.13/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"An American Pickle lacks the tart snap viewers might expect given its creative premise, but Seth Rogen's dual performance makes this a low-key comedy to relish.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney said: \\"An American Pickle is neither the most substantial nor the most sophisticated comedy, but its soulful sweetness outweighs its flaws.\\" Barry Hertz of The Globe and Mail gave the film three out of four stars and wrote: \\"[Rogen] also manages to make the film's har-har dual-role conceit work beyond mere shtick. There is Herschel, and there is Ben, and Rogen plays each one of them with a decidedly unique energy. Meanwhile, director Brandon Trost, a longtime cinematographer for such Rogen films as Neighbors and The Interview, makes the mensch-on-mensch action seem as real as can be.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety called the film \\"too cantankerous to be funny and too preposterous to believe\\" and wrote that \\"An American Pickle, in its ethnically satirical and scattered way, lacks the integrity of its own ridiculousness. It's pungent but flavorless: an unkosher dill.\\" References External links  Category:2020 films Category:English-language films Category:2020 comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films set in Brooklyn Category:Films shot in Pittsburgh Category:Films shot in Pennsylvania Category:HBO Max films Category:Films about Jews and Judaism Category:Films about immigration to the United States Category:Rip Van Winkle-type stories Category:Films set in 1919 Category:Films set in 2019 ","title":"An American Pickle"},{"id":"58595460","text":"Guido Sandleris (born 11 May 1971) is an Argentine economist who was President of the Central Bank of Argentina.

Early life He was born in Aberdeen, Scotland. As a teenager, he relocated to the United States. He tried his hand at various trades, including gold mining, eventually settling in California, where he became engaged in the mercantile business. In 1854, he sailed for Hawaii, intending to return to California. He eventually worked for Hackfield & Co. in Honolulu, and then Thomas Spencer, and became successful with his own import and export business in the kingdom. Cabinet minister King KalƒÅkaua appointed him Minister of Finance on November 7, 1874, during which he was a member of the House of Nobles in the legislature. The announcement cited Walker's business success in Hawaii as the factor in his being appointed. Within the next month, Walker publicly released \\"Statement of the Revenues and Expenditures of the Hawaiian Kingdom for eighteen years.\\" In 1876, Walker left the cabinet to work for William G. Irwin. Along with Zephaniah Swift Spalding, Walker and Irwin organized William G. Irwin & Co.

The Life and Death of a Racehorse, completed in 1792 was a popular work and reproduced as aquatint prints and often accompanied with a thought-provoking text on animal cruelty.

Early life and family Jane Mitchel was born Jane Verner around 1820 near Newry, County Down. At the time she, her brother and her mother Mary Ward were living with Captain James Verner (1777‚Äì1847). James Verner was from a prominent Armagh family, and was involved in the Orange Order, going on to become Orange deputy grandmaster of Ireland in 1824. Although James Verner raised Mitchel, she is not believed to be his child. Mitchel attended Miss Bryden's School for Young Ladies in Newry. She met her husband, John Mitchel, when she was 15. The couple eloped in November 1836, but did not marry as James Verner pursued them to Chester and brought her home to Ireland. They eloped again in 1837, and were married at Drumcree Church, County Armagh on 3 February. At this point Mitchel was disowned by James Verner, and went to live with her in-laws at Dromalane, County Down. They then moved to Banbridge in 1839 where her husband practised law. The couple went on to have six children, three daughters and three sons. Life The couple moved to Dublin in October 1845 when John Mitchel became the assistant editor of The Nation. They lived at 8 Ontario Terrace, Rathmines, where there were Young Irelanders met. She was a full supporter of her husband's nationalism. She aided in his work with The Nation, reading other newspapers, keeping and filing reference clippings, going on to become and editor and anonymous contributor to the United Irishman from February 1848. John Mitchel was convicted of treason for inciting insurrection in May 1848, and was sentenced to fourteen years' transportation. Mitchel urged his fellow Young Irelanders to fight his removal, and denounced them when they failed to come out in support of him. Due to her standing in the nationalist community, ¬£1,450 was raised to support her and her family. For three years, Mitchel lived in Newry and Dublin, before she joined her husband Van Diemen's Land in June 1851, where they settled in the village of Bothwell. Their youngest child, Isabel, was born there in 1853. Mitchel travelled around the island with her husband, visiting fellow Irish exiles, becoming fond of William Smith O'Brien in particular. When John Mitchel escaped in July 1853, Mitchel travelled with her children to join him in Sydney, from where they sailed to America. They lived for a time in Brooklyn, New York from 1853 to 1855, rekindling friendships with old friends who were fellow Young Ireland exiles. In May 1855, the family moved to a remote farm at Tucaleechee Cove in the Allegheny Mountains, Tennessee. Mitchel feared that the isolation and life in a primitive log cabin would be detrimental to their children's education, and at her behest the family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee in September 1856. From here John Mitchel ran a pro-slavery newspaper, the Southern Citizen. The family moved again in December 1858 to Washington, D.C. Mitchel shared her husband's support of the Southern States and of slavery. Mitchel accompanied her husband to Paris in September 1860, and in opposition to some of the family, she supported her daughter Henrietta's conversion to Catholicism and entrance into a convent. She remained in Paris and Ireland with her daughters, while her husband and sons assisted the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Without letting her husband know, Mitchel resolved to return to America when she heard of her youngest son, William's, death at Gettysburg in July 1863. She sailed with her daughters, Mary and Isabel, as Henrietta had died earlier the same year. Whilst their ship ran a blockade by the Union, the ship was shelled, ran aground, and caught fire near the coast of North Carolina. Mitchel and her daughters were unhurt, but lost all of their possessions. By December 1863, Mitchel had joined her husband in Richmond, Virginia, remaining their for the rest of the Civil War. Their eldest son, John, was killed in action in July 1864. Later life The family returned to New York after the war, and John Mitchel set up another paper, the Irish Citizen (1867‚Äì72). Due to lack of funding for the Irish-American press and her husband's ill health resulted in the family falling into poverty. This was alleviated by a testimonial raised by William and John Dillon in 1873. Mitchel was widowed in March 1875, going on to receive $30,000 from nationalist sympathisers. She invested this money in a photolithographic firm she and her son, James, ran. Mitchel died at home in Bedford Park, New York on 31 December 1899. She is buried in Woodlawn cemetery, New York, with her plot marked with a large Celtic cross. She was survived by two of her children, James (1840‚Äì1908) and Mary (1846‚Äì1910).

During his time with the Huskies Marottolo was listed as a member of the team but never played in a game and is not listed as having revived a letter. After graduating Marottolo went to France, joining the French division IV Hockey Club de Metz as a player/coach for two years and also coached the Euro-Sport/Drummond Hockey School. In 1992 Marottolo returned to the North Haven area to serve as an assistant at Trinity in Hartford and later transitioned to the same position at Yale. Marottolo worked for Yale for thirteen seasons, helping the team reach the NCAA tournament in 1998, the first time the program had done so in 46 years. In 2009 the Bulldogs won their first conference tournament championship and returned to the NCAA bracket. Marottolo was expected to continue his role at Yale until Shaun Hannah, the head coach at nearby Sacred Heart, suddenly resigned a month before the 2009‚Äì10 season began. Marottolo was enticed to take over as the fourth head coach in program history. The team responded to the new hire by winning 10 more games than they had done the year before, finishing the year as runner-up for both the regular season and tournament title in Atlantic Hockey and earning Marottolo the conference coach of the year award. The following year, Sacred Heart dropped in the standings and remained there for three years, winning a school-low 2 games in 2013. After the three-year slump the Pioneers started to recover and produced double-digit wins in each of the following five seasons, but weren't able to produce a winning record.

Like many other deities of the Svan pantheon, her name is derived from a Christian figure; in her case, Mary, mother of Jesus. Lamaria is the goddess of the hearth, protector of cattle, and a protector of women ‚Äì particularly during childbirth. She also ensured the fertility of a village's grain fields. She was also known as a patron of beekeeping, although that function was later assigned to the Svan interpretation of St. George. Lamaria is generally categorized today as a goddess of female functions and spaces. She was venerated by women either inside their homes in the absence of men (the \\"interior of the interior\\"), or in small shrines in uninhabited spaces outside a village's boundaries (the \\"exterior of the exterior\\"). This was in contrast to religious rituals performed by men for male functions, which were either performed at public rituals inside the home, or within remote churches far up mountainsides (the \\"exterior of the interior\\" and the \\"interior of the exterior\\", respectively). Offerings made to Lamaria included cloth, jewelry, and beads. Sometimes, portable hearths were used for outdoor rituals involving Lamaria. Lamaria was also sometimes associated with or considered equivalent to Barbol, another goddess of feminine and domestic functions. Some scholars have suggested that both originate from the same pre-Christian deity. The French scholar Georges Charachidz√© believed Lamaria was derived from an Indo-European deity, possibly the Ossetians or their ancestors, the Alans. He viewed Lamaria as a hearth goddess similar to the Roman goddess Vesta. In contrast, linguist Kevin Tuite viewed her as a multi-faceted figure displaying Vestal traits as well as associations with remote wilderness, like the Khevsurian goddess Samdzimari. There was a festival in lower Svaneti called the \\"tower feast\\" which involved Lamaria. The festival revolved around a snow tower built by participants. A sacred tree would be placed at the top of the tower, and a figurine of the goddess would be attached to the top of the tree. The figurine was given a dagger and a wooden phallus, and its face was covered. A round dance would be performed and the tree shaken until the figurine's face covering fell off. Then the village's children would race to climb the tower and make the Lamaria figurine fall to the ground. Anthropologist Kevin Tuite noted that the ritual had significant elements of liminality.

Gerard initially produced the painting as an official portrait of Napoleon I for his throne room at the Tuileries Palace. It was later moved to the Palace of Versailles. It spent time in the Louvre Museum, at the √âlys√©e Palace from 1849 to 1851 under the presidency of Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte, then at the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud, and returned to Versailles in 1894. Description The painting depicts the emperor Napoleon I at his coronation on 2 December 1804. He is standing before a blue-cushioned gilt throne, wearing a white robe embroidered with gold thread, a long red trimmed with ermine, and white . His head is crowned with golden laurels, and he is wearing a golden collar of the L√©gion d'honneur. He is holding a staff topped by an eagle in his right hand, and his left hand is resting by his side; further to his right is a stool bearing an orb and cross and an ivory-headed sceptre, a typical of the French Crown Jewels. The work measures - with its frame, - and weighs . Many copies were produced during the First French Empire. There are workshop paintings in, for example, the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau, the H√¥tel des Invalides in Paris, in the Rijksmuseum (on loan from the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen since 1922), in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow, the Hofburg in Vienna, and the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin Naples Vienna  Capodimonte Museum A copy is now in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples, probably after being taken there by Joachim Murat, although it is not known where it was first exhibitedTouring Club Italiano, p. 228.. When the Bourbons were restored to the throne of Naples, the painting was initially moved off public display and into a barn at the Palace of Portici. The work was attributed to G√©rard in the 1840s and the work was moved to the main floor of the palace. In an 1874 inventory the work was reattributed to Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson and moved to the Palace of Capodimonte, where it still hangs in Room 54 within the Royal ApartmentsTouring Club Italiano, p. 226-228.. Despite being a copy, the work also has several notable differences to the original - in the copy the figure's pose is modelled on that of Michaelangelo's David, standing with the sceptre of Charles V of France in one hand and a gold laurel wreath on his head. To his left is a cushion bearing the hand of justice and an orb, whilst there is a throne in the background. The work's celebratory tone is reinforced by a French-made frame surmounted by emblems of Napoleon.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1965 and a Master of Business Administration from the University of North Carolina in 1966. He also graduated with a Master of Divinity in 1977 and with a Doctor of Divinity in 1989 from the University of the South. From 1977 till 1981 he was College chaplain at Western Kentucky University and Vicar of Trinity Church in Russellville, Kentucky from 1977 till 1985. He was also Archdeacon of Kentucky from 1981 till 1986,when he was elected Bishop of Montana. In 2000 an allegation was made against Bishop Jones alleging that he had a sexual relationship with a parishioner and parish employee who sought pastoral counseling from him when he was the rector of a parish in Kentucky, hence violating Title IV, Canon 1. Jones submitted his resignation to the diocesan council on February 26, 2001. The resignation, which became effective on February 28, followed a February 14 decision by the Court for the Trial of a Bishop deposing Jones for sexual misconduct. In exchange for Jones' resignation, the Standing Committee and Diocesan Council agreed to give him a $170,000 settlement. The agreement included forgiving his home mortgage with the diocese, which had a balance of slightly less than $55,000, and the remainder covering 15 months of his salary, minus travel pay.

Ida, p. 227; Tripp, s.v. Ida, p. 315; Gantz, pp. 2, 743; Hard, p. 75.  Mythology  According to Apollodorus, Rhea gave the infant Zeus to the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus, leader of the Kuretes of Crete, to nurse, and they fed Zeus on the milk of the goat Amalthea.Apollodorus, 1.1.6-7\\\\.

She was associated with the Cretan Mount Ida. According to the second- century geographer Pausanias, Ida was represented, on the altar of Athena Alea at Tegea.Larson, p. 153; Pausanias, 8.47.2-3. Ida was one of eight nymphs on either side of the central figures of Rhea and the nymph Oenoe holding the infant Zeus.

The pegs have been used by the NHL since 1991. Various sizes of Marsh pegs  History  Fred Marsh (1934-2016) was a Canadian who worked as a Zamboni driver at various hockey arenas throughout western Canada. Marsh invented the pegs in the 1980s, aiming to design a product that was both flexible enough to absorb shock when a player hit the net, yet strong enough to keep the net in place. The pegs were first used in Moose Jaw and Saskatoon, in Saskatchewan, Canada, as well as Kitimat, in British Columbia before spreading throughout the WHL. In 1991, the NHL made Marsh Pegs the standard. They have been used in the Winter Olympics since the 1998 and also in World Cup games.  Recognition  In 2000, Marsh won the Ernest C. Manning Innovation Award for his invention. After his passing in 2016, Marsh was mentioned on the television show Hockey Night in Canada by Don Cherry.  Controversy  Steven Stamkos broke his right leg after colliding with a net in a 2013 match between Tampa Bay and the Boston Bruins. Some players claimed that the net came off the moorings too easily. Marsh disagreed, insisting that \\"the net reacted the way it should,\\" and that the overhead replay showed that the goalpost had been dislodged prior to Stamkos' leg colliding with the net.

The intestinal atresia is of the \\"apple-peel\\" type, in which the remaining intestine is twisted around its main artery. The front third of the eye is typically underdeveloped, and there is usually moderate developmental delay. Less common features include an atrial septal defect, increased muscle tone or skeletal abnormalities. Physical features may include short stature, large, low-set ears, a small jaw, a large mouth, epicanthic folds or fine, sparse hair. The syndrome is caused by mutations in both copies of the CENPF gene, which codes for centromere protein F. This protein is involved in cell division, in which it forms part of a disc-shaped protein complex known as a kinetochore. CENPF also has a role in orienting long, cylindrical structures called microtubules to form thin cell protrusions called cilia, which send and receive signals to trigger cell division, migration or differentiation. Mutations in the gene result in slower cell division and some embryonic developmental processes being disrupted or not completed, and the syndrome can be classified as a ciliopathy. The syndrome is typically diagnosed based on the symptoms, but genetic testing provides a full confirmation. Treatment centres around the symptoms. The intestinal atresia is usually surgically correctable in infancy with anastomosis. The prognosis is not yet certain. Those who have survived birth and infancy (the majority) have continued to live through childhood and adolescence, but a large minority with the most severe cases have died before or shortly after birth. The prevalence is not yet known. , around 13 individuals had been diagnosed. The syndrome was first identified based on symptoms in two siblings by Norwegian paediatrician Petter Str√∏mme and his associates in 1993. It was named after him in a 2008 study describing another patient. In 2015, mutations in CENPF were first identified as pathogenic, and a 2016 genetic analysis of Str√∏mme's original two siblings found that both had mutations in both of their copies of CENPF, establishing it as the cause of the syndrome.  Signs and symptoms  The most common symptoms of Str√∏mme syndrome are intestinal atresia, eye abnormalities and microcephaly. However, the syndrome has a wide range of severity that generally runs in the family it presents in, ranging from only mild learning disability and microcephaly with no other features in some families to death in utero with severe kidney, heart, eye, skeletal, brain and intestinal malformations in others. The variable severity is usually due to the presence or absence in each family of mutations in other genes with similar functions to CENPF. = Intestinal = Individuals with Str√∏mme syndrome are typically born with intestinal atresia, in which parts of the intestine are narrow or missing, leading to neonatal bowel obstruction that must be operated on. The intestinal atresia is of the \\"apple-peel\\" type, an uncommon type in which the remaining portion of the intestine is found twisted around its main artery, and this usually affects the jejunum. Often, much of the bowel is missing in this form of atresia. There can sometimes also be intestinal malrotation. At least two individuals with the syndrome in literature have avoided intestinal atresia, one of which had a sibling with the same mutations who did not. In two siblings who did not survive to term, the intestinal atresia (which also included duodenal atresia) and malrotation were more severe. = Eyes = The eyes are often smaller and underdeveloped, usually more severely in one eye than the other. This can manifest as a coloboma (hole) in the iris, cataracts, opacity of the cornea (leukoma), sclerocornea (in which the white of the eye blends into the cornea), a small cornea (microcornea) and synechia (in which the iris adheres to the cornea or lens). This underdevelopment of the front of the eye, known as anterior segment dysgenesis (which includes Peters' anomaly), can lead to an increased risk of glaucoma from high intraocular pressure, due to impaired eye fluid drainage, though this hadn't been reported in any of the affected individuals . There may also be crossing of the eyes (esotropia), and less commonly there may be twisted retinal blood vessels or optic nerve hypoplasia. The eye anomalies can result in an inability to focus (astigmatism) as well as amblyopia, in which the brain begins to fail to process input from the weaker eye during childhood. = Neurological = Those affected with the syndrome usually have microcephaly. A large minority also have pachygyria (fewer ridges in the brain) or lissencephaly (shallower ridges). Developmental delay is usually present. It has usually been moderate-to-severe, but in some cases it has been mild. A few of those affected have had increased muscle tone. One individual had cortical heterotopia, which is a sign of impaired neuronal cell migration during neural development. Agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and cerebellum have been found in at least one living affected individual and several who did not survive to term. Hydrocephalus occurred in one living individual 9 months after birth and in four who did not survive to term. Hydrocephalus was also observed in zebrafish whose CENPF genes were experimentally knocked out. Cerebellar hypoplasia in association with hydrocephalus is called Dandy‚ÄìWalker malformation and is found in a number of other ciliopathies, sometimes together with agenesis of the corpus callosum. = Physical features = Physical features are variable but usually include short stature, large, low-set ears, a high nasal bridge, a small jaw and a large mouth. Some of those affected have had epicanthal folds or fine, sparse hair. One individual was born with a skin tag on the left cheek. Four affected individuals who did not survive to term had cleft palate. = Heart = A minority of those affected have been born with an atrial septal defect, a type of congenital heart defect. One affected individual had a ventricular septal defect and neonatal peripheral oedema in the legs. Two individuals who did not survive to term had a patent foramen ovale, a specific type of atrial septal defect, as well as reduced heart muscle tissue (myocardium) and abnormally small heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes). = Skeletal = One affected individual had hip dysplasia, leading to dislocation, and another had metopic craniosynostosis, leading to a metopic ridge. Two individuals who did not survive to term had polydactyly of the thumb (preaxial polydactyly), flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly) and a rare chest wall malformation called a sternal cleft. = Kidneys = One living individual had underdeveloped and malformed kidneys, and two siblings who did not survive to term had underdeveloped kidneys and ureters, leading to a build-up of urine called hydronephrosis. = Blood = One affected person had a reduced number of platelets (thrombocytopaenia) in infancy, requiring transfusion. Platelets are cellular fragments formed from protrusions on megakaryocytes that enable blood clotting. Blood symptoms have not yet been reported in any other affected individuals.  Cause  392x392px Str√∏mme syndrome is caused by mutations in both copies of the CENPF gene, located on the long arm of chromosome 1. CENPF codes for centromere protein F. Centromere proteins are involved in the separation of chromosomes during cell division. This is through forming part of kinetochores, which are disc-shaped protein complexes that allow the centromeres of chromosomes (in the dividing form, known as chromatids) to attach to microtubules in the cell (forming what is called the spindle apparatus). This allows the microtubules to pull the chromosomes apart in the process of dividing the cell. Mutations in this gene lead to impaired cell division during early development. Mitosis has been found to take longer when CENPF is mutated. Microtubules are protein structures that are part of the cytoskeleton and are necessary for cells to have diverse, complex shapes and migratory ability. They are made by the centrosome, which contains a pair of cylindrical centrioles at right-angles to each other. Before division, CENPF localises at the end of one of the centrioles (the mother centriole) in order to orient microtubules correctly to form thin cellular projections called cilia. Most cilia are primary cilia, which are involved in cell signalling, sending and receiving signals to trigger cell migration, division or differentiation. Mutations in CENPF disrupt this ability to form cilia; cilia have been found to be fewer in number and shorter when CENPF is mutated. Str√∏mme syndrome therefore falls under the classification of diseases known as ciliopathies. Mutations that have been identified in CENPF have been mostly nonsense mutations, which result in the protein being cut short and usually non-functional as a result, but frameshift and splice-site mutations have also been identified. Several of the nonsense mutations that have led to this syndrome have been in exon 12 of the gene (out of 20), but mutations in other exons have been identified. Severity and symptoms of the syndrome have been variable regardless of the type of mutation but generally consistent within families, suggesting the severity may depend on the presence of mutations in other genes that perform similar functions to or otherwise interact with or affect CENPF (a phenomenon known as epistasis). It has been suggested that an interaction between CENPF and NDE1, which causes microlissencephaly when mutated, is related to the microcephaly in Str√∏mme syndrome.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is typically achieved by observation of symptoms, however genetic testing provides a full confirmation. The microcephaly, intestinal atresia and some of the eye abnormalities are observable on prenatal ultrasound. Brain MRI scans can reveal any brain anomalies that could be associated with the syndrome. Methods of genetic detection include whole exome sequencing and panel testing, which involves sequencing a selection of potential genes involved. Sanger sequencing can confirm the nature of the mutation. Once a family has been identified as being carriers for mutated CENPF genes, prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis can be offered for future conceptions.  Treatment  Treatment targets the symptoms. The intestinal atresia is usually surgically correctable in infancy with anastomosis, however no eye surgery had been reported . Van Bever et al. recommended monitoring patients for glaucoma.  Prognosis  The prognosis is not yet certain. The majority of those affected have survived birth and infancy, and these individuals have continued to live through childhood and adolescence. However, a large minority with the most severe presentations have died before birth or shortly after. The oldest known people with the syndrome, Str√∏mme's original two siblings, who had a mild-to-moderate presentation, were in their twenties and in employment .  Epidemiology  The prevalence of the syndrome is not yet known. , around 13 individuals had been diagnosed.  History  The condition was first identified in 1993, when Norwegian paediatrician Petter Str√∏mme and his associates observed two infant siblings with microcephaly and eye abnormalities alongside apple-peel intestinal atresia at Rogaland Central Hospital in Stavanger, Norway. They proposed that it constituted a new syndrome. Later studies by Slee and Goldblatt (1996), Shanske et al. (2002), Bellini et al. (2002) and others observed other patients with similar symptoms who appeared to have the syndrome. In 2008, Van Bever et al. proposed that the syndrome be named after Str√∏mme, after encountering another patient who seemed to have the syndrome. In 2015, Waters et al. conducted a genetic analysis on a British family in which four foetuses had miscarried with symptoms of a ciliopathy. They found that the foetuses had mutations in both copies of CENPF. They subsequently analysed a cohort of 1,000 individuals with microcephaly and found that one of them, a girl, had mutations in both of her copies of CENPF. Her learning delay was mild-to-moderate, and she did not have any other issues with her bodily systems. This confirmed for the first time that mutations in CENPF are pathogenic. In 2016, Filges et al. followed up with Str√∏mme's original two siblings and found using whole exome sequencing that they both had mutations in both of their copies of CENPF, establishing mutations in CENPF as the cause of Str√∏mme syndrome.  Notable cases  * In May 2017, Ruby Ardolf (born 2004), from Minnesota, United States and diagnosed with Str√∏mme syndrome, appeared in an Instagram video answering questions from her mother Angela which went viral, gaining over 500,000 views in a week. Angela manages a website, online store and YouTube channel for her daughter, with over 170,000 subscribers .

Their father rejoiced and sent a group of soldiers with them. When they arrived at the place, they asked the soldiers to return to their parents and tell them that they had decided to stay there. They recognized a monk named Hanna who asked them to go to Syria to learn the origins of monastic life by a monk named Aghabus. When Aghabus felt close to the date of his death, he told them that he saw a vision and a man named Macarius of Egypt told him that Maximos and Domadious should go to him in Egypt after his death. At that time, the Patriarch of Constantinople died. King Theodosius asked to see the monk Maximos to told him he wished to make him the patriarch of Constantinople. When Maximos and Domadious learned of this, they fled together and stayed with one of the shepherds, where they prayed to Christ to guide them to Macarius. They traveled about nine days near the seashore, and found themselves in ≈†ihƒìt (the valley of Natrun now). Macarius met them and helped them build a modest house and taught them a simple work to support themselves. They did not deal with anyone or go out of their house except to go to Saint Macarius to take holy sacraments. Macarius marveled at their silence and that during that time they did not talk to him, so he went to their place of residence and stayed there. And during the night he awoke and saw Maximos and Domadious praying, surrounded by a light from heaven and an angel guarding them with a sword of fire.

And be my grace and strength, my God and my lord, because you are the Lord of light and the Savior of the world\\". And light surrounded the place and a group of prophets, apostles, saints, John the Baptist and the king Constantine were all standing around the saint until he delivered his pure spirit. Macarius cried and said, \\"Blessed are you Maximos\\" this was on the 14th of the month of Tobi. Dumadios cried bitterly, and asked St. Macarius to ask Christ to bring him to his brother. Three days later, he suffered from a severe fever, and Macarius was told about it and went to visit him. While he was on the way, he stood for a long time looking toward the cave, then turned to the east. Those people with him thought that he was praying but he was contemplating the Church of the Saints who were advancing the spirit of St. Domadius. Macarius looked up at the sky, crying and knocking his chest, saying, \\"Domadius has departed\\". This was on the 17th of the month of Tobi. Macarius built a church in their place of residence, the first church built in the wilderness. Maximos and Domadious were the first monks to die in ≈†ihƒìt.

The focal point of the \\"Cabellera vs. Cabellera\\" series of shows is one or more traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet matches\\", where all competitors in the match risk their hair on the outcome of the match. The Lucha de Apuestas is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre, especially when a wrestlers mask is on the line, but the \\"hair vs. hair\\" stipulation is held in almost as high regard. The July Cabellera vs. Cabellera event was the third under that name held by IWRG in 2018, preceded by a January event and a June event. For the July 2018 Cabellera vs. Cabellera event Obett defeated X-Fly in the culmination of a several months long storyline that also included Obett' s son Lunatic Xtreme and X-Fly's son, El Hijo de X-Fly. After X-Fly was forced to have all his hair shaved off. The show featured five additional matches. Production =Background= In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so-called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. By the same token a wrestler betting his hair in a Lucha de Apuestas is seen as highly prestigious, usually a step below the mask match. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The park's theme was American Old Western, modeled after 1850s Las Vegas. The site included various amusement rides and a replica of Las Vegas' Old Mormon Fort, which contained the Hondo Casino. As of 1979, the casino accounted for half of Old Vegas. The park also featured several relocated buildings from the former El Rancho Vegas hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. The Eureka Locomotive was also on display at the park during the 1980s. Old Vegas was developed as a sister property to Old Tucson, a similar theme park in Arizona. Old Vegas was approved by the Henderson City Council in January 1975, and construction was underway in 1977. Old Vegas opened the first of two phases in November 1978, with more than 100 employees. The park briefly closed for alterations during 1979, following its sale to television producer Burt Sugarman and Mexican industrialist Gabriel Alarcon Jr. Sugarman and Alarcon reopened the park under the name Westworld, although the park reverted to its original name later that year. Sugarman and Alarcon applied for a gaming license to continue operating Old Vegas' casino, although Alarcon was denied a license because of state investigators' inability to adequately trace the source of his money. Construction of a second phase began in July 1980, and was completed later that year. The park closed in 1986 for remodeling, but was never reopened. During the 1990s, there were plans to add three hotel-casinos on the site, but none materialized. Old Vegas was demolished in 1997, and a 631-unit housing subdivision, also named Old Vegas, was approved for the land in 2001. History In January 1975, the Henderson City Council unanimously approved plans for Old Vegas, a American Old West project that would be built along Boulder Highway. The project would include a western village, apartments, a dude ranch, and stables. The project was also intended to be used as a filming location for television series and western films. The project would be developed by a group that also owned Arizona's Old Tucson theme park and was led by Robert Shelton. The project was expected to begin construction within six months, with an opening expected in late 1976. The park's target audience was tourists and families. The $8.1 million project was proposed by Old Vegas Corporation (later Old West Corporation), and would feature the history of southern Nevada, with a recreation of 1850s Las Vegas as its theme. Cecil Simmons was the primary organizer of Old Vegas and would later become one of the main financiers for the project. The western theme park and film studio was designed by Shelton with architecture firm Wells, Tate and Kennedy. The project was master planned by Dallas-based LARC (Leisure and Recreation Concepts) with Robert L. Smith Construction as the general contractor. Old Vegas was to be constructed in two phases, with the second phase initially planned to be completed by the end of October 1978. The first phase was under construction in 1977, and was expected to cost $2.5 million, with completion expected in spring 1978. The project would be built on 55 of the 124 acres. Future plans for the remaining 69 acres included a resort ranch, a motel, a camp site, and an apartment complex, all of which would be built after Old Vegas generated the necessary funds. The project's sound stage would be similar to Old Tucson and would include wardrobe and production facilities. The layout of the project's western streets was done by Hollywood art directors to be accommodating to film production companies. The opening of the park's first phase was later scheduled for mid-June 1978, with the entire park expected to be complete by summer 1979. Old Vegas' first phase was later scheduled to open in September 1978, with a cost of $3.5 million. The final cost of the project was expected to be between $7 million and $10 million. During mid-1978, three buildings from the former El Rancho Vegas hotel on the Las Vegas Strip were relocated to become part of Old Vegas, to be restored for future television and film appearances. In August 1978, Old Tucson Corporation reached an agreement to merge with Old West Corporation, the park's developer. Old Vegas was developed as a sister property to Old Tucson, and was built at the southeastern edge of Henderson. =Opening and sale= Old Vegas opened its first phase in November 1978, with over 100 employees. Phase two would include western buildings and amusement rides, including a stage coach and a steam train. A third phase was also being planned at the time of opening. Located along Boulder Highway was an 11-foot-high bronze statue of Raphael Rivera, advertising the theme park. Also located along Boulder Highway was a replica of Las Vegas' Old Mormon Fort. The $3.5 million fort housed several attractions, including a sutler store and a blacksmith area. The fort also included the Hondo Cantina, featuring a first-floor saloon and steakhouse, and a 225-seat banquet room on the second floor. Also within the fort was the Hondo Casino, and a historical museum. Additionally, the fort included the 300-seat Commandant's Theatre, which showed visitors a film presentation narrated by Dale Robertson, depicting the history of the local area. The theme park advertised with the slogan \\"A Passport to the Past\\". In November 1978, the city council approved plans for 140 townhouses to be built at Old Vegas. Later that month, Old West Corporation received unanimous approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission to operate 87 slot machines at Old Vegas' casino, which began operations in December 1978, with 70 machines. In February 1979, a fire began in the attic of an employee locker room, but was quickly extinguished. A former employee was found to have set the fire and was arrested for arson. That month, the directors of Old Tucson Corporation agreed to sell a majority of the company's shares to Burt Sugarman, a Los Angeles television producer; and Gabriel Alarcon Jr., a Mexico City industrialist. =Westworld= Old Vegas was temporarily closed on March 13, 1979, to undergo alterations for a planned reopening the following month under the name Westworld. Mary Kempner, the park's marketing manager, stated that while Shelton had wanted Old Vegas \\"along the lines of Knott's Berry Farm, Sugarman has more of a Disneyland type of park in mind so it is planned to be a blend of the two with the authenticity of the old.\\" Among the alterations was the remodeling of the park's kitchen facilities to ensure faster service. Other planned upgrades would include more youth attractions, including a video game arcade and a train exhibit, as well as eight major amusement rides and four children's rides, all of which was to be opened by June 30, 1979. Also considered was the showing of approximately nine hours of Priscilla Presley's home movies of her husband Elvis that had never been showed to the public. Other future plans included a covered rodeo ground. The new board of directors applied for a gaming license to continue operating 92 slot machines in the casino. Westworld's opening became uncertain when the Nevada Gaming Commission denied a request by Sugarman and Alarcon to operate the casino while they underwent a state-mandated gaming license investigation. The casino accounted for half of the park at that time. In May 1979, the city council approved Sugarman to operate three blackjack tables at Westworld, and the gaming commission gave him unanimous approval for gambling operations. That month, Old Tucson Corporation announced that it had acquired many items and memorabilia from Paramount Pictures' western street that would be incorporated into Westworld's western street. Old Tucson Corporation also announced that it had purchased the rights to showcase the Elvis Presley home movies at Westworld and Old Tucson. Old Tucson Corporation was renamed Westworld Inc. during May 1979. Westworld opened in early June 1979. Priscilla Presley visited the park shortly before its opening to film an introduction to the home movies that the park planned to show in its theater. Later in June 1979, the city council approved plans for amusement rides to be built on land that was previously planned for Old Vegas buildings. At the end of the month, Alarcon was denied a gaming license as state investigators could not satisfactorily trace the source of his money, due to Mexico's different accounting procedures. In August 1979, LARC reached an agreement to assist in the management and operations of Westworld and Old Tucson. =Expansions and fire= In September 1979, Sugarman sold his interest in Westworld Inc. and the park reverted to its original Old Vegas name. By that point, Simmons was the overseer of gambling operations at the park. By 1980, Old Vegas included two restaurants and a casino, and there were plans to rebuild the Paramount Pictures western street adjacent to the park's Old Mormon Fort. Westworld Inc. began construction of the second phase in July 1980. The second phase would include a railroad museum and other historic exhibits, as well as the Wagon Camp picnic and barbecue areas. Part of the second phase was the Eureka Locomotive, which went on permanent display at Old Vegas, along with Virginia and Truckee Railroad equipment. Other additions would include a merry-go- round, go-karts, and an antique steam locomotive. The second phase cost $1.5 million, and was opened in October 1980. More than 10,000 people attended Old Vegas during the opening weekend of the second phase. The third phase, consisting of a western street and additional rides, was scheduled to begin construction in December or January. Nearby residents subsequently complained about noise coming from the park, including music, simulated gun fights, and late-night fireworks. Westworld Inc. suffered financial losses in 1982, mostly resulting because of poor customer attendance at Old Vegas. Plans to renovate the park were indefinitely shelved. Old Vegas ultimately consisted of several small streets, but not a full western town. The park had little use as a filming location. To raise revenue, Westworld Inc. attempted to sell land surrounding Old Vegas, but had ruled out a sale of the park for the time being. During 1984 and 1985, Westworld planned to sell Old West Corporation. A Tony Roma's restaurant operated at the park during the mid-1980s. A fire occurred at the park on the night of May 8, 1985, burning down the park's rock shop, which collapsed onto the Eureka locomotive. After less than an hour, the fire was put out by the local fire department. A police detective stated that the fire was not started naturally and likely was not due to an electrical issue; arson was considered a possibility. Westworld subsequently was given three extended deadlines to install a retrofit fire sprinkler system, with the final deadline being July 1, 1986. =Closure and redevelopment plans= Westworld Inc. chose to close the park on July 1, 1986 to install the fire sprinkler system and conduct other remodeling. Old Vegas was expected to reopen in approximately 60 days. However, later in July, Westworld Inc. instead put the closed theme park and the entire 125-acre property up for sale at a price of $5.6 million. For the previous two years, Westworld Inc. had made private attempts to sell the park. At the time of the closure, the Henderson Home News stated, \\"Park managers have kept Old Vegas' local profile very low and seem to only actively recruit bus tour and other visitor-related customers.\\" In late December 1986, Las Vegas resident Steve Allen and local developer Maurice Threinen agreed to purchase 43.5 acres that included the Old Vegas facilities, with plans to reopen the park in March 1987. In February 1987, Westworld Inc. put Old Vegas into Chapter 11 bankruptcy during the impending sale. By the following month, Allen and Threinen had experienced undisclosed problems and had yet to complete their purchase of the park. They had also not yet applied for various city and state licenses needed to operate the property, including gambling licenses. By April 1987, Threinen's purchase contract with Westworld Inc. had defaulted and the company then began negotiations with MarCor Development, a development firm based in Las Vegas that agreed to purchase the entire 125-acre property. MarCor had unfinalized plans to develop the 125 acres into a multi-use tourist and residential project. MarCor's purchase of the property was complete in September 1987; the debt issue had been resolved by Westworld Inc. MarCor and Boyd Group, among other entities, then formed Sunset Partners to develop a hotel-casino project on the 125-acre property. The partnership hoped to begin construction in early 1988, with an opening by the end of the year. Tentative plans would include a 200-room hotel, a 200-space RV park, and a small theme park. The overall project would cost $20 million to $30 million, and would include the removal of the fort. The rides would also be removed, and other family attractions such as a bowling alley and a picnic area would be added. MarCor remained undecided on whether to keep the Old Vegas name. Groundbreaking for the new resort was delayed for various reasons, including the opening of several new resorts in the Las Vegas Valley. Focus 2000, formerly MarCor Development, announced plans in July 1992 to refurbish and reopen Old Vegas, including the fort and its restaurant and casino. Focus 2000 was a spinoff of MarCor Resorts, which owned the Rio hotel-casino in the Las Vegas Valley. Following the planned reopening, Focus 2000 intended to build up to three hotel-casino projects afterward to accompany Old Vegas. Also planned were three truck and RV centers and a possible factory outlet mall. Over the next year, Focus 2000 worked on the project plan with nearby residents who were concerned about its impact on their neighborhood. In June 1993, Focus 2000 proposed a master plan for the Old Vegas site consisting of three hotel-casinos and an RV park. Work on the new project was not expected to start until early 1995, approximately one year after the scheduled completion of a nearby road project to reroute U.S. Route 95. Marnell Corrao Associates was chosen by Focus 2000 as the general contractor for the hotel-casino complex. Zoning changes for the site were approved in September 1993. The project would include a 522-space RV park and three hotels with a total of 4,000 rooms, as well as a convenience store located on three acres, to be known as Old Vegas Convenience Store. Retail space, totaling , would also be a part of the project. The entire project was expected to be built out gradually over the course of seven to ten years. Residents approved of the project on the condition that Focus 2000 construct a 2,200-foot-long wall to separate the project from the residential neighborhood. Focus 2000 had concerns about obtaining funding for the wall, which was expected to cost over $200,000. As of 1995, the closed theme park was used only for special occasions. That year, Rio Hotel and Casino Inc. purchased 60 acres of the site as a partner, as part of a strategic growth plan by the company. Rio planned to focus on expanding its eponymous resort, while groundbreaking on the Old Vegas project was planned for a future date. The company had tentative plans for the site to build a hotel-casino with 600 to 700 rooms. A decision on whether to demolish Old Vegas was contingent on the theme of the future project that would be built around it; Rio senior vice president and chief financial officer Harlan Braaten said about Old Vegas, \\"If we have a western theme, then that might work with the overall plan. But if we decide not to go with a western theme, then it wouldn't fit in.\\" Because of safety concerns, Old Vegas was demolished in 1997, although the sign was left standing for several years. During 1997, at a cost of $30 million, Focus 2000 put the Old Vegas property up for sale as the potential site of a future casino project. However, real estate brokers and gaming analysts believed the site was in a poor location for such a project. Anthony Marnell II, who owned the Rio and Focus 2000, had plans in 1998 to build a casino on 20 acres of the land, as well as a gas and convenience store on another three acres. The casino would include between 75 and 199 slot machines, and up to nine table games. Flying J was interested in building the truck stop, which was opposed by nearby residents who believed that such a business would be a nuisance. In 2001, the Henderson planning commission and city council approved D. R. Horton to construct a 631-unit housing subdivision on the site. The new housing community retained the Old Vegas name. Construction of the Old Vegas housing project was underway in 2002.

This was the second meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and the United States, following their first meeting in Singapore the previous year. On February 28, 2019, the White House announced that the summit was cut short and that no agreement was reached. Trump later clarified that it was due to North Korea's request to end all sanctions. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho asserted that the country only sought a partial lifting of the five United Nations sanctions placed on North Korea between 2016 and 2017. Background The first North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit between Kim and Trump took place in June 2018 in Singapore with the objectives of resolving the long-term Korean conflict involving ICBM nuclear weapons and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. A series of bilateral summits was held between North Korea's Kim Jong-un, China's Xi Jinping, South Korea's Moon Jae-in, and Donald Trump of the United States. Announcement The White House confirmed the planned summit between North Korean WPK Chairman Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump on September 11, 2018. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the DPRK and the U.S. were \\"working diligently\\" to make sure the conditions were right for the summit. Trump stated the host country would be Vietnam, and the dates to be February 27‚Äì28, during his second State of the Union Address on February 5, 2019. He later announced that the summit would be in Hanoi.  Vietnam's reactions and preparations  US, North Korea and Vietnam flags on Nguyen Chi Thanh street. Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ph·∫°m B√¨nh Minh visited North Korea at the invitation of DPRK Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho from February 12‚Äì14. The visit came ahead of the summit between Chairman Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump planned to take place in H√† N·ªôi, Vietnam on February 27 and 28, which a spokeswoman from the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on Twitter. Developments since the June 2018 Summit Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appointed Stephen Biegun as United States Special Representative for North Korea on August 23, 2018. In September 2018, The New York Times reported that \\"North Korea is making nuclear fuel and building weapons as actively as ever\\" but is doing so quietly, \\"allowing Mr. Trump to portray a denuclearization effort as on track.\\" Two months later, The Times reported that North Korea appeared to be engaged in a \\"great deception\\" by offering to dismantle one missile base while developing sixteen others. The Times reported this expansion program was long known to American intelligence but contradicted Trump‚Äôs public assertions that his diplomacy was yielding results. Immediately following the June 2018 summit, Trump had declared \\"There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea... sleep well tonight!\\" A third inter-Korean summit was held on September 18‚Äì20 in 2018, seeking a breakthrough in the hampered talks with the U.S. and a solution for the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. In November 2018, North Korea repeated its demand that U.S. economic sanctions be lifted as a condition for proceeding with talks, while the Trump administration continued to insist that North Korea make concessions first. Meetings between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean officials were scheduled, canceled due to disagreements, and then rescheduled. The February 2019 summit was confirmed after Kim Yong Chol, North Korea‚Äôs top negotiator met with Trump in the Oval Office on January 18, 2019. In the days leading up to the summit, Trump declared that former president Barack Obama had been on the verge of going to war with North Korea and had told Trump so during the transition, which suggested that Trump had pulled the U.S. back from the brink of war; however former Obama aides denied these claims. Trump also suggested that he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomacy with North Korea, with the U.S. informally asking Japan to nominate Trump, according to Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, which Shinzo Abe did so according to the it, but reports were neither confirmed nor denied, as it is tradition to keep nominations confidential. Noting that one of North Korea's primary objectives is to replace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, Scott Snyder, the senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, observed, \\"What I worry about is the president may want the peace most ‚Äî more than the denuclearization...[o]ne of the big worries that people have is that somehow the president is going to trade the alliance for the prospect of a Nobel Peace Prize.\\" Top American intelligence officials testified to Congress in January 2019 that it was unlikely North Korea would fully dismantle its nuclear arsenal, and Trump national security advisor John Bolton continued to believe North Korea could not be trusted and that denuclearization efforts would fail. Trump asserted that North Korea‚Äôs pause of weapons testing since the Singapore summit was a sign of progress, but Bruce Klingner of the Heritage Foundation said there had been longer testing pauses during previous administrations. Going into the summit, wide gaps persisted between the two countries, including disputes on what the exact definition of denuclearization entailed. In January, Biegun had repeated the official American stance was that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted until the country had fully denuclearized. On January 31, 2019, Biegun indicated that American negotiators may not demand that North Korea provide a full inventory of its nuclear and missile programs as a first step toward denuclearization, a demand that North Korea had been resisting. Preparations =Preparatory talks= United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with North Korea's Chairman Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. On October 7, 2018, Pompeo traveled to Pyongyang to negotiate the second summit between President Trump and Chairman Kim. Pompeo later met with Moon in Seoul to inform him of the upcoming summit. On January 8, 2019, Kim Jong-un met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to consult with him on the possibility of the Kim‚ÄìTrump summit in Vietnam. On January 18, 2019, The White House announced that President Trump and North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un would meet for the second time in February. On February 5, 2019, Trump announced during his State Of The Union address that the summit would take place on February 27‚Äì28 in Vietnam. On February 16, 2019, Reuters reported that Kim would arrive in Vietnam on February 25 ahead of the summit. = Train journey to Vietnam = Kim Jong-un stayed in Melia Hanoi Hotel during the summit Kim Jong-un departed from Pyongyang on February 23, according to images released by the KCNA news agency. The exact itinerary was kept secret. The trip took about 60 hours. The train arrived in ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng railway station of the Vietnamese border city of ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng on Tuesday February 26, and Kim was scheduled to travel to Hanoi by vehicle. Some experts analyzed the reason for long train trip instead of swift air travel, Kim Jong-un opts to follow his grandfather Kim Il Sung's footsteps in 1958 to Vietnam through China by using the train for a long journey.ARIRANG NEWS- 24 Feb 2019:[ISSUE TALK] N. Korean leader on way to Vietnam; U.S. president to depart on Monday ARIRANG NEWS  Meeting location  = Locations considered = Regarding the release from Bloomberg and the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo anticipated the location of the second Trump‚ÄìKim Summit as Vietnam's capital city, Hanoi, because Vietnam is a long-standing partner of DPRK, and there is also an excellent foreign relationship between Vietnam and the US. During the 2019 State of the Union Address, President Trump announced Vietnam as the host of the second meeting between the two leaders. = City choice = Presidential Palace in Hanoi; the second Trump- Kim summit location was confirmed to take place in Hanoi, Vietnam There was a list of several cities that were considered potential to host this event. It includes government direct-administered cities (Hanoi, ƒê√† N·∫µng, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City) and some other places like H·∫° Long, Nha Trang, Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc. However, Hanoi was said to be the best candidate for many reasons, such as being presented with the title ‚ÄúCity for Peace‚Äù by the UNESCO, being the capital of Vietnam, and being a favorable place for Vietnamese leaders to meet DPRK leaders and USA leaders. It was reported that when the city in Vietnam was still being discussed, the main contenders were Hanoi (favored by North Korea because it has its Embassy there) and Da Nang (favored by the United States because the 2017 APEC Vietnam summit was held there).Trump announces second Kim summit will take place in Vietnam , Kylie Atwood and Zachary Cohen, CNN, February 6, 2019. On February 8, 2019, President Trump confirmed that Hanoi was to host the summit meeting. = Venue choice = The French Colonial Metropole Hotel was chosen as the summit venue DPRK officials had repeatedly investigated the Government Guesthouse and the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi, Hanoi's first international hotel. The summit was held at Sofitel Legend Metropole Hotel in Hanoi.  Summit meeting  = First day =  Meeting with Vietnamese leaders  President Donald Trump and General Secretary Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng, February 27, 2019 President Trump met Vietnamese President and General Secretary Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng around at 11:42 am local time. They watched the Vietnamese airline executives sign a series of business deals with U.S. companies. Some examples of contracts were that VietJet Aviation JSC announced it would acquire 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, and also signed an agreement to purchase CFM International LEAP engines and maintenance services from General Electric. Bamboo Airways signed a deal to buy 10 Boeing 787-9 aircraft. President Trump also had a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Ph√∫c on February 27. One-on-one meeting At Hanoi‚Äôs Metropole Hotel, Trump and Kim had a one-on-one meeting for 30 minutes on Wednesday evening. They started the summit at 6:30 pm local time (6:30am Eastern Standard Time) with a handshake and then participated in a one-on-one meeting, with interpreters only.  Dinner  U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un having dinner, along with their delegation President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim started with a social dinner in Hanoi on Wednesday. There were a few key attendees at the dinner; seated at the round table were U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, DPRK Vice Chairman Kim Yong-chol, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho. President Trump assured North Korea a \\"tremendous future for your country\\" in his initial comments with Chairman Kim. Chairman Kim described the second summit as a \\"courageous political decision\\" by Trump and also added that there had been \\"a lot of thinking, effort, and patience\\" between now and previous June summit in Singapore. On the first night of the summit, the White House announced that Trump and Kim would sign a ‚Äújoint agreement‚Äù the next afternoon. = Second day = One-on-one meeting During the one-on-one meeting in Hanoi, Kim was asked by a reporter if he would consider opening a US liaison office in Pyongyang. Kim initially hesitated to answer the question and asked Trump to excuse the press from the summit room, but Trump urged Kim to answer the question, to which he responded through an interpreter that the idea was ‚Äúwelcomeable‚Äù. Trump acknowledged the response as a positive one. After that, another reporter asked if Kim was willing to shut down his nuclear program, to which he responded, \\"If I‚Äôm not willing to do that, I wouldn‚Äôt be here right now.\\" The leaders then went into a closed-room meeting. However, the planned working lunch between Trump and Kim was canceled, as well as the potential joint signing ceremony. After preliminary negotiations between Trump and Kim went over a period of time, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters waiting to cover the lunch that it had been called off. One month after the summit ended, Reuters reported that on the second day of the summit Trump passed Kim a note that bluntly called for North Korea to surrender all its nuclear weapons and fuel, in similar fashion to the ‚ÄúLibya model,‚Äù a proposal the North Koreans had repeatedly rejected. The scheduled ceremonial luncheon was then abruptly canceled and the summit ended.  End of summit  President Donald Trump and Secretary Mike Pompeo at the press conference after the summit The White House on Thursday, February 28, 2019, announced that the summit was cut short and that no agreement was reached. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not tell reporters why the schedule was changed and whether there was going to be a signing ceremony. This unexpected turn of events caused stocks on the South Korea stock exchange to fall. President Trump said in a press conference after the summit in Hanoi that the summit was cut short because North Korea wanted an end to economics sanctions. President Trump elaborated by saying \\"Basically, they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn‚Äôt do that,\\" Trump said. \\"We had to walk away from that particular suggestion. We had to walk away from that.\\" During the press conference after the summit, Trump discussed American student Otto Warmbier, who was imprisoned for 17 months by North Korea for conviction of subversion , and who died shortly after being returned comatose to the U.S. Trump said he believed Kim's word that Kim did not personally know about Warmbier's alleged poor treatment when Warmbier was in North Korean custody. Trump also stated that it was not to Kim's benefit to allow Warmbier to be treated poorly. = A news conference from DPRK = Hours later, in a rare move, North Korean officials called a news conference. North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-ho offered a different account of his country's position compared to Trump; that North Korea had proposed only a partial lifting of sanctions. 5 out of a total of key 11 United Nations sanctions, Ri stated that North Korea wanted 5 sanctions originally imposed in 2016 and 2017 lifted. In exchange, Ri said that North Korea offered to \\"permanently and completely\\" dismantle its primary nuclear facility in Yongbyon, and that American experts would be allowed to observe. Ri also quoted North Korea as proposing to put in writing that the country would end all nuclear tests and long-range missile tests. Ri continued that the North Koreans saw that no agreement could be made after the United States demanded one further measure in addition to destroying the Yongbyon nuclear facility. Lastly, Ri concluded that North Korea's proposal would not be changed. According to NK News, Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui made the proposal to dismantle Yongbyon just before the talks collapsed, but the U.S. team walked out when Choe was unable to give details. News report NBC News reported on the second day of the summit that American negotiators had dropped their demand that North Korea provide a detailed inventory of its nuclear and missile programs. NBC also quoted U.S. official's speech: the current focus of deal is the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. Nuclear scientist Dr. Siegfried Hecker claimed: \\"Yongbyon is the heart of North Korea's nuclear program, and if we are completely dismantling the Yongbyon nuclear facility, North Korea would never be able to make plutonium there again\\".  Reactions and analysis  = Pre-summit = Cheong Seong-chang, vice president of research planning at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said: \\"After the first Trump‚ÄìKim summit, for 260 days, they did not waste their timeliness. Instead, they continuously finalized their negotiation strategies for the two leaders' agreement and terms for the next step to be discussed on the second Trump‚ÄìKim summit.\\"NBC-NEWS-JAPAN - 17 April 2018: Second Trump-Kim summit seen coming as North Korea continues to 'nuclearize'  Japantimes.co.jp BBC News believed that DPRK Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un could potentially learn from Vietnam's social, political and economic history during the second Trump-Kim summit. While the country has strict rules against political liberalization, it is fairly lax in their social, religious, and economic guidelines. Citizens were able to travel to neighboring countries often. Vietnam also pursued multi-front foreign policies so they would not be dependent on just one economy and built modern systems for banking and finance. According to the BBC, the DPRK can also learn from Vietnam's mistakes in the past regarding managing their natural resources and handling political unrest. The BBC believes these are some cases the DPRK could learn from Vietnam's practice to help them in improving their economy by attracting foreign investors and developing closer relations with other countries. It is also assumed by the BBC that Vietnam's economic reform is a better pattern for the DPRK to follow than China's. Al Jazeera assumed that the impact of China on the second Trump‚ÄìKim summit would be significant. The relationship between China and North Korea is centered on \\"mutual benefit\\", but it differs from \\"mutual trust\\". Australian professor Carlyle Thayer claimed China and the DPRK are of the corresponding inclination after Kims' four visits to China and \\"it indicates some kind of coordination\\". China believes that it is impossible for North Korea to abruptly destroy nuclear missiles. However, it is hoped that North Korea's nuclear missile program will be shut down gradually, as economic sanctions against North Korea will be eased.aljazeera.com - 22 Feb 2018:China's shadow looms large over second Trump-Kim summit ‚Äô  aljazeera.com News Andrew Kim, former head of the CIA's Korea Mission Center, believes in Supreme Leader Kim's genuine desire to achieve denuclearization and get a concession from the United States. In a speech Andrew Kim made on Friday, February 22, at Stanford University, Kim said that Supreme Leader Kim told United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \\"[that] he is a father and husband and he does not want his children to live their lives carrying nuclear weapons on their back\\". He also believes that the DPRK tried to strike a deal with previous administrations, but they waited too long, and they aim to finalize the deal with the Trump administration before it's too late. Kim assessed that the closure of the Yongbyon nuclear facility will be the beginning of full denuclearization and that this could lead to a peace treaty. The Yongbyon facility is known to be the center of nuclear development and research in North Korea. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Kim's previous propaganda was changed into patriotism and economy, and in improving the relationship between the United States, China and South Korea. = Post- summit =  South Korea and Japan  South Korea and Japan both supported Trump's decision to cut the summit short. However, a spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-in said \\"We do regret that President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un did not reach a complete agreement at today's summit,‚Äù but also that the summit \\"made more meaningful progress than any other time in the past.\\" = South Korea = Jung Da-min, Staff Reporter at The Korea Times newspaper, believes that the Hanoi summit was not a total loss since it still resulted in diplomacy between the two countries. Though no concrete agreement regarding denuclearization was reached, DPRK President Kim was quoted last Tuesday (5 March) that he was committed to the complete denuclearization of his country. However, the description of denuclearization seems to be different between the U.S. and North Korea, which was why Stephen Biegun, Special Representative for North Korea, advised that the U.S. will not accept a ‚Äúphased denuclearization‚Äù. Even though no agreement was signed in Hanoi, both countries are open to future talks, which shows that some agreement was made regarding few agendas, like the installation of a liaison office in Pyongyang, North Korea. Hwang Jihwan, a Professor in the Department of International Relations at the University of Seoul, believes the no-deal outcome of the Hanoi summit was because both parties asked for more than what each could give. However, a no-deal is better than a bad-deal, and suggests that the two leaders should aim for realistic goals in future summits. Asking for huge deals from each other would not yield favorable results for both sides, but working on smaller, workable agreements that would be meritorious for both countries was better than leaving the negotiation table empty-handed. The Chosun Ilbo, one of the south Korean newspapers, reported on May 30, 2019 that Kim Hyok-chol, the lead working-level negotiator for North Korea at the Hanoi summit, was executed in March 2019, along with four other diplomats. The paper also reported that Kim Yong-chol, a top aide to Kim Jong-un, was sentenced to hard labor. However, several photos were later released on June 3, 2019 showing Kim Yong-chol alive and attending a musical performance alongside Kim Jong Un and Ri Sol-ju  United States  A Monmouth University poll found that while 65% of those surveyed ‚Äî including 42% of Democrats ‚Äî agreed that holding the summit was a good idea, 44% said it was likely to help reduce the North Korean nuclear threat. Former special assistant to U.S. President Ronald Reagan, and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, Doug Bandow, compared the DPPK and U.S. relations to that of Reagan and Gorbachev, where the agreement resulted in the end of the Cold War. Bandow contended that President Trump was demanding unrealistically for Kim Jong Un to dismantle all his nuclear facilities, whereas Kim was only agreeing to shut down the Nyongbyon Nuclear facility in exchange for a partial lifting of a few UN sanctions against his country. Asking continuously for an all nukes for sanctions deal is deemed as malicious in its intent and illogical and that it would put a strain on the U.S.-North Korean relationship, which was volatile in the past, and could result in more problems for Washington and its allies in Asia, according to Bandow. Douglas Dillon, Professor of Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, and former director of Harvard‚Äôs Belfer Center, Graham T. Allison, believes that the Hanoi summit is not a complete failure, despite some public opinion, and also compared the state of affairs to the Reagan- Gorbachev era. Like Trump, Reagan also had to deal with negative public opinion regarding his dealings with the USSR, but he was able to remove all of the Soviet Union‚Äôs intermediate nuclear-armed missiles with an INF deal. Compared to the USSR, North Korea is also not a normalized country, but President Trump was able to engage with the top leader of North Korea directly, something his predecessors George W. Bush and Barack Obama were not able to do in their combined 16 year term. U.S. Senior Expert on North Korea, Frank Aum, said that future goals of the Trump administration should be the founding of smaller deals that resulted from the Hanoi summit. Deals that include the declaration of the end of the Korean War, exchange of liaison offices in both Pyongyang and Washington, some sanctions relief, and verified dismantling of some of North Korea's nuclear facilities (Nyngbyon, Punggye-ri, and Dongchang-ri) are attainable. According to Aum, Trump‚Äôs \\"Big Deal\\" approach to North Korea would have been unrealistic, since it is not possible to achieve complete denuclearization in two years. He also said that some of the road-maps to establishing complete denuclearization might be the most hopeful solution. A political scientist specializing in international security, Christopher J. Watterson, argued in The Diplomat that \\"North Korea‚Äôs willingness to give up fissile material production in Nyongbyon might reflect an intent to shift operations to Kangson, rather than an intent to cease fissile material production altogether.\\" Reuters revealed the existence of a document handed to President Kim by President Trump that may have caused the collapse of the Hanoi summit. The document and its contents were first proposed by John Bolton in 2004 and‚Äîaccording to Washington-based expert on North Korea, Jenny Town‚Äîhas been rejected more than once and \\"... to bring it up again ... would rather be insulting.\\" She also said that the U.S. should have learned that this was not effective diplomacy, and shows they have not learned how to properly negotiate with North Korea. According to Abby Bard, a research associate for Asia policy at the Center for American Progress, President Trump‚Äôs and President Kim‚Äôs teams need critical space between them to build trust and verify the intentions between the two parties. Without regular communication from both sides, it will be impossible to reach an agreement as they are both skeptical of one another‚Äôs intent. Stephen Biegun did not meet with his North Korean counterpart before the summit at Hanoi took place, which resulted in the meeting not having enough support for negotiations. Meetings between both teams are needed to arrange the details that would result in bigger bargains without miscalculations and misunderstandings. In order for the two leaders to reach a deal, their teams need to work together. Before the end of 2019, nine months left for the Trump administration to negotiate a deal with DPRK, since Donald Trump will need to run for re-election in 2020, the time to strike a bargain with President Kim is getting short with very little breathing space for another painstaking dialogue. Despite the collapse of the Hanoi summit, Katharine Moon, professor of Political Science and the Wasserman Chair of Asian Studies at Wellesley College, said that there were good things that came out of it: It has opened doors for further negotiations in the future, and these talks require working- level counterparts that aim to pursue respective and mutual interests between the two countries to breakthrough their engagement. North Korea needs to stay at the negotiating table for economic reasons, as long as the Trump administration stays committed to continuing the dialogue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she was glad the president walked away from the second summit with the DPRK without a joint agreement. She also emphasized that \\"What we want is the denuclearization of North Korea,\\" and she also believes that, although the DPRK wanted the sanctions lifted, but because they didn't agree to give up their nuclear weapons entirely, it was right that President Trump decided not to sign any deal. Se Young Jang, a fellow at the Stanton Nuclear Security at MIT‚Äôs Security Studies Program, said timing is crucial compared to the previous Clinton Administration‚Äôs Agreed Framework with North Korea that failed to proceed. Trump and Kim both revealed details of the Hanoi summit, which leaves very little room for flexible compromises for future negotiations This means another summit would might be more realistic after the working- level renew their trust-building process. To achieve this, the role of South Korea as a bridge-maker or mediator is more significant than ever before. U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo said in an interview with CBS on April 5 that he believed that the Hanoi summit was an opportunity for both the U.S. and DPRK to have a deeper understanding of each other, and hoped that a third Trump-Kim summit will happen in the near future. He also believes that South Korea is helping with the denuclearization efforts, and he understands that many North and South Koreans have the same blood and they are family.  Malaysia  Dr. Chiew-Ping Hoo, a professor at the National University of Malaysia, said that the negotiations at the Hanoi summit changed the minute John Bolton was added at the eleventh-hour to the panel. He advised to change the goal-post from the Yongbyon nuclear site, to add other sites that produced weapons of mass destruction. Trump had to agree with Bolton‚Äôs advice due to U.S. domestic issues, which resulted in a no-deal outcome for the summit. She also believes that North Korea is not convinced that changing the deal is the right course, but to return to the pre-Hanoi agreement details. South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, is ready to meet with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, for a fourth time to try and save the stalled denuclearization deals between the US and DPRK. President Kim, however, has asked President Moon to support a common goal to unite North and South Korea, rather than support the United States. In previous talks, both Leaders have agreed to reconnect the railways and roads that run through both their countries, normalize a factory park in Kaesong Industrial Zone, and allow South Korean tourists to once again visit the Mount Kumgang resort. However, this joint project is still waiting for the partial relief of U.N. sanctions to begin operations. South Korean President, Moon is also planning to inviting DPRK leader Kim to Asean-South Korea commemorative summit in November 2019. Despite the unresolved Hanoi deal, President Trump is optimistic that a denuclearization deal can still be achieved from North Korea. The summit taught them the limits of top-down diplomacy, and discussions between working-level officials from both sides is necessary, and while no concrete agreement was met, they were still able to establish something that can be molded into a deal both leaders will agree to in the future. The DPRK has yet to respond to senior working-level talks, but President Kim prefers to deal directly with Trump. President Trump can go back to the U.N. and ask for a new Security Council resolution authorizing to suspend some of the sanctions against North Korea along with their dismantling of their Nuclear weapons program, but with snapback provisions. It is better than the all-or-nothing option, since it will allow the United States flexibility to offer the sanctions relief without giving up all its advantages. DPRK Leader Kim said that \\"We maintain good relations with U.S. president, as to be able to exchange letters asking about health anytime if we want\\" and He is also willing to attend another summit with Washington by the end of the year 2019. but Kim desires to the U.S. comes to the table with a constructive attitude for the nuclear deal. Joseph Yun, until March 2018 the American Special Representative for North Korea Policy, said of the summit's outcome, ‚ÄúThis really speaks to the lack of preparation. You cannot draft a joint statement out of nothing. They never quite got around to building a consensus around sanctions, and that led to the deadlock.‚Äù Veteran diplomacy and national security journalist Michael Gordon reported in The Wall Street Journal: \\"If the two sides had opted for the traditional bottom-up approach to diplomacy, their diplomats would have worked to close the divide and only arranged for a summit when they appeared to be within striking distance of an agreement. However, U.S. and North Korean diplomats have had only intermittent meetings since the June summit, and both sides bet they would be more successful by pressing their case at another summit. Mr. Kim calculated that Mr. Trump would be more flexible in agreeing to lift sanctions than his subordinates. Mr. Trump, for his part, assumed that he was the best person to pursue the art of the nuclear deal.\\" Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, stated, ‚ÄúNo deal is better than a bad deal, and the president was right to walk. But this should not have happened. A busted summit is the risk you run when too much faith is placed in personal relations with a leader like Kim, when the summit is inadequately prepared, and when the president had signaled he was confident of success.‚Äù US President, Donald Trump, got negative reviews for his stance regarding the Otto Warmbier incident. His supportive remarks for the North Korean leader in his speeches while negotiating denuclearization, was not received well even by the Warmbier family who were grateful to him after their son‚Äôs return. In the case of Otto Warmbier, President Trump said that it's a very \\"delicate balance,\\" since he is trying to establish a big denuclearization deal with Chairman Kim, but at the same time, he feels for the Warmbier family. In the speech he gave to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), he mentioned that there is positive developments in negotiating the return of American prisoners in North Korea as well as the remains of soldiers killed in the Korean War. The improvement of his relationship with Kim is also in keeping with the U.S. National interest and that further progress is to be expected in the next couple of months.  China and Russia  A meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin is confirmed to be held on 25‚Äì26 April 2019. Top U.S. envoy Stephen Biegun is scheduled to visit Russia that month to discuss the full denuclearization of North Korea. However, there are unconfirmed reports that President Kim and President Putin will be meeting soon. President Putin is going to attend the One Belt, One Road forum in Beijing on April 26 to 27, and the meeting between Kim and Putin is expected to happen before or shortly after this forum. Perhaps this meeting with Russia is what President Kim believes might help ease international and unilateral sanctions for his country, which will help improve North Korea‚Äôs weakened economy. Russian President Putin believed that DPRK Kim Jong Un needs international security guarantees to give up nuclear arsenal and program. =Plans for another summit= On June 12, 2019, Trump received a letter from Kim Jong-un which he described as \\"beautiful.\\" On June 26, 2019, it was announced that talks were underway to hold a third US-North Korean summit. Trump previously tweeted in April 2019 that a third summit ‚Äúwould be good.‚Äù On June 22, 2019, An undated photo was also released by the North Korean government of Kim Jong-un reading a letter from Trump. Kim described the letter as \\"excellent\\" and described Trump as the \\"supreme leader\\" of the United States. However, Kim later denied reports of continued talks with the United States, and relations with the US State Department still remained hostile. June 2019 DMZ Summit On 30 June 2019, Kim Jong-un again met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the Korean Demilitarized Zone with Trump being the first sitting US president to set foot on North Korean soil, shaking hands warmly and expressing hope for peace. Kim and Trump then joined South Korea‚Äôs President Moon Jae-in for a brief chat, marking an unprecedented three-way gathering. The two leaders agreed to restart negotiations for the Korean denuclearization process.  Satellite imagery of Sohae Launching Station  Days after conclusion of the summit, commercial satellite imagery indicated that reconstruction of the Sohae ICBM launch site, which North Korea previously appeared to be dismantling, may have been underway even during the summit, and the site could be operational. A senior State Department official acknowledged ‚Äúsome level of reassembly‚Äù but stopped short of concluding the site was operational. Jenny Town, managing editor of 38 North, remarked, ‚ÄúGiven how much has been done at this site, it looks like more than a couple days‚Äô worth of activity...It‚Äôs hard to say if it happened immediately after the summit and they just rushed everything ‚Äî I guess it‚Äôs possible ‚Äî but it‚Äôs more likely that it started just before.‚Äù South Korean National Intelligence Service chief Suh Hoon said there was recent transport vehicle activity at the Sanumdong ICBM factory. Some analysts believed that the renewed activity at Sohae and Sanumdong was designed to pressure Washington back to the negotiating table, rather than to actually restart the nuclear testing program.

She is a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, elected in 2018, representing the south and west parts of Madison, Wisconsin. She is also a member of the Dane County Board of Supervisors, since 2006; she is the only African American on the County Board and is Dane County's first African American representative in the Wisconsin Legislature.  Background  Stubbs was born in Camden, Arkansas, but moved to Beloit, Wisconsin, as a child (Walter Knight, her uncle, served on Beloit's city council and its police and fire commission). She graduated from Beloit Memorial High School and attended Tougaloo College, earning a baccalaureate degree in political science. She went on to study at Mount Senario College, earning a second baccalaureate, in criminal justice management, and then earned a master's in management at Milwaukee's Cardinal Stritch University. She had worked for eight years as a probation and parole agent with the Wisconsin Department of Corrections before first being elected to the Dane County Board in 2006.

It is a portrait of Peale's younger brother, Rubens, who helped run the family museums and raised plants and animals. It is an early painting by Rembrandt Peale, painted when he was 23 and Rubens was 17. It is signed \\"Rem Peale 1801\\". The National Gallery of Art describes it as \\"among the finest portraits in the history of American art\\".Torchia, 48, 51  Analysis  The portrait is informal and reveals Rubens' sensitive nature. He has an unstudied posture, and he is accompanied by a geranium (possibly Pelargonium inquinans) in a terracotta pot, which takes up so much space in the composition as to compete for attention with the ostensible subject, Rubens. This is a departure from traditional European portraiture, and valued for its \\"embodiment of an ideal in American art that favors candor over pretension, clarity over complexity, and the natural over the conventional\\".Soltis, 5 The National Gallery suggests that the work is almost a double portrait of Rubens and the geranium, which may be the first specimen of the plant grown in the US. Stylistic aspects of the plant can be seen in the young man's posture and clothing. The \\"V\\" shape of Rubens' lapels and shirt is echoed in the rising stalks of the geranium, and similarly the locks of hair on his forehead are echoed by the curves of the leftmost stalks. As two of his fingers rest on the lip of the pot, the two pointed fronds at the top of the plant are close to his hair. Rubens is both wearing and holding glasses. In this era, portraits subjects rarely wore glasses. The historian Billie Follensbee suggests that Peale sat for the portrait holding his glasses in his hand, with Rembrandt Peale returning to the canvas later and overpainting another pair of glasses on his face. This would account for the impossible combination of the strong lens refractions seen on his cheeks with the lack of visual distortion seen through the lenses. There is no physical evidence that the glasses were added later, but Rubens' daughter, who received the painting in 1854, wrote that they were a later addition.Torchia, 54, 50  History  The painting was acquired by his relative James Claypoole Copper, who later gave it to Rubens' daughter Mary Jane Peale (1827‚Äì1902), and the painting descended through the Peale family. It was sold to the art collector Lawrence A. Fleischman, and then before 1963 to Pauline E. Woolworth, wife of Norman Bailey Woolworth. In 1985 it was sold at Sotheby's to the National Gallery of Art, which paid $3.7 million (before buyer's premium). This set a record for an American work of art sold at auction, replacing Frederic Edwin Church's The Icebergs ($2.5 million).

It consists of a small, private harbor that belongs to the Petersgaard estate and a few scattered houses. Several of the buildings have been listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. Petersv√¶rft is situated at the foot of a hill, Stehlebakken. It is surrounded by Langeb√¶k Skov to the east and Stensby Skov to the west. History Peter Johansen, a merchant and shipowner from Copenhagen, acquired the estate Kalvehave in auction from the Crown in 1774. He renamed it Petersgaard and constructed a Neoclassical main building on the land in the period 17667-80. In 1777 he also established a dockyard at the site.Ships built at the dockyard included Enigheden (1781) Cron Princesse Louice Augusta (1784) and Christiane (1785). Cron Princesse Louice Augusta was built for the Danish Asiatic Company and was the largest Danish ship built outside Copenhagen at the time. Peter Johansen died on the Petersgaard estate in 1798 and his heirs sold it to the Crown the following year. The Crown sold Petersgaard to Jacob Bentzon Resch but kept the forests and dockyard. Petersv√¶rft was from 1807 to 1814 used as a naval base and for rebuilding the Danish navy which had been confiscated by the Royal Navy in the aftermath of the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807. Several new buildings were constructed at the site. Harbour The harbor comprises a 30 x 20 m harbor basin situated on the west side of a 69 m long pier. The harbor basin is reserved for the owner of the harbor (Petersgaard) and the residents of T√¶r√∏. Other sailors are allowed to berth at the end of the pier for periods of up to 24 hours. Buildings The Forest Coachman's House (Skovkuskeboligen, Petersv√¶rft 5), also known as Forpagterboligen, dates from the late 18th century. It is a thatched building with half-timbered gables. Skovriderg√•rden (Petersv√¶rft 3) dates from circa 1800. It is a brick building with a red tile roof. It also comprises an L-shaped, half-timbered, thatched barn. The Officers' House (Petersv√¶rt4) is the only surviving building from Petersv√¶rft's years as a navel base. The oldest part of the building is from 1807 but it was expanded in 1885 and 1903. It is an L-shaped brick building with a half hipped red tile roof. Skovfogedstedet (Petersv√¶rft 2) is a one- storey, thatched house from 1905 which was expanded in 1916. It also comprises a thatched outbuilding. Both buildings were listed in 1994.

Influenza D viruses are known to infect pigs and cattle; no human infections from this virus have been observed. First isolated from pigs in 2011, the virus was categorized as a new genus of Orthomyxoviridae in 2016, distinct from the previously-known Influenzavirus C genus; before then, Influenza D virus was thought to be a subtype of Influenzavirus C. Cases of infections from the Type D virus are rare compared to Types A, B, and C. Similar to Type C, Type D has 7 RNA segments and encodes 9 proteins, while Types A and B have 8 RNA segments and encode at least 10 proteins.  Influenza D virus  The influenza viruses are members of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza viruses A, B, C, and D represent the four antigenic types of influenza viruses.‚ÄúSeasonal Influenza (Flu)‚Äù Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. March 22, 2012. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm Of the four antigenic types, influenza A virus is the most severe, influenza B virus is less severe but can still cause outbreaks, and influenza C virus is usually only associated with minor symptoms.Margaret Hunt. ‚ÄúMicrobiology and Immunology On-line‚Äù University of South Carolina School of Medicine. 2009. http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/mhunt/flu.htm Influenzavirus D is less common than the other antigenic types, and it is not known to cause any human infections. No samples of influenza D virus were detected in serum samples from humans; however, hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies against influenza D virus have been detected in humans, with an estimated occurrence of 1.3% in the general population, suggesting that this virus may infect humans as well. However, those antibodies may have been produced after an infection by influenza C virus, the antibodies for which cross-react with the Type D virus. More studies are needed to conclude whether or not the Type D virus can infect humans. Influenza D virus is 50% similar in amino acid composition to influenza C virus, similar to the level of divergence between types A and B, while types C and D have a much greater level of divergence from types A and B. Influenzaviruses C and D were estimated to have diverged from a single ancestor over 1,500 years ago, around 482 AD. Influenzavirus D itself currently has two lineages, which were estimated to have emerged over 45 years ago, around 1972 AD. Influenza A virus can infect a variety of animals as well as humans, and its natural host or reservoir is birds, whereas influenza viruses B, C, and D do not have animal reservoirs. Influenza viruses C and D are not as easily isolated so less information is known about these types, but studies show that they occur worldwide. This virus may be spread through respiratory droplets or by fomites (non-living material) due to its ability to survive on surfaces for short durations. Influenza viruses have a relatively short incubation period (lapse of time from exposure to pathogen to the appearance of symptoms) of 18‚Äì72 hours and infect the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. In cell culture, influenza D virus has demonstrated an ability to replicate well at 37¬∞C, the normal lung temperature, and can also replicate better and in more types of cells than the Type C virus. This study suggests that influenza D virus may be only a few genetic changes away from being able to invade the lower lung, even though the virus does not actively spread among humans and has a much slower mutation rate than the other influenza viruses.  Structure and Variation  Influenza viruses, like all viruses in the family Orthomyxoviridae, are enveloped RNA viruses with single stranded genomes. The antigens, matrix protein (M1) and nucleoprotein (NP), are used to determine if an influenza virus is type A, B, C, or D. The M1 protein is required for virus assembly and NP functions in transcription and replication. These viruses also contain proteins on the surface of the cell membrane called glycoproteins. Type A and B have two glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Types C and D have only one glycoprotein: hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF). These glycoproteins allow for attachment and fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Fusion of these membranes allows the viral proteins and genome to be released into the host cell, which then causes the infection. Types C and D are the only influenza viruses to express the enzyme esterase. This enzyme is similar to the enzyme neuraminidase produced by Types A and B in that they both function in destroying the host cell receptors. Glycoproteins may undergo mutations (antigenic drift) or reassortment in which a new HA or NA is produced (antigenic shift). Influenza viruses C and D are only capable of antigenic drift whereas Type A undergoes antigenic shift, as well. When either of these processes occur, the antibodies formed by the immune system no longer protect against these altered glycoproteins. Because of this, viruses continually cause infections.  Identification  Influenza viruses C and D are different from Types A and B in their growth requirements. Because of this, Influenzavirus D is not isolated and identified as frequently. Diagnosis is by virus isolation, serology, and other tests. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) is one method of serology that detects antibodies for diagnostic purposes. Western blot (immunoblot assay) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are two other methods used to detect proteins (or antigens) in serum. In each of these techniques, the antibodies for the protein of interest are added and the presence of the specific protein is indicated by a color change. ELISA was shown to have higher sensitivity to the HEF than the HI test. Because only Influenza viruses C and D produce esterase, In Situ Esterase Assays provide a quick and inexpensive method of detecting just Types C and D.  Vaccination  Because influenza virus A has an animal reservoir that contains all the known subtypes and can undergo antigenic shift, this type of influenza virus is capable of producing pandemics. Influenza viruses A and B also cause seasonal epidemics every year due to their ability to antigenic shift. Influenza viruses C and D do not have this capability, and they have not been implicated in any pandemics; thus, there are currently no human vaccines available for Influenza viruses C or D. An inactivated Influenzavirus D vaccine was developed for cattle; however, the vaccine only provided partial protection in challenge experiments.

There are two types of cerebellar degeneration; paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and alcoholic or nutritional cerebellar degeneration. As the cerebellum contributes to the coordination and regulation of motor activities, as well as controlling equilibrium of the human body, any degeneration to this part of the organ can be life-threatening. Cerebellar degeneration can result in disorders in fine movement, posture, and motor learning in humans, due to a disturbance of the vestibular system. This condition may not only cause cerebellar damage on a temporary or permanent basis, but can also affect other tissues of the central nervous system, those including the cerebral cortex, spinal cord and the brainstem (made up of the medulla oblongata, midbrain, and pons). Cerebellar degeneration can be attributed to a plethora of hereditary and non-hereditary conditions. More commonly, cerebellar degeneration can also be classified according to conditions that an individual may acquire during their lifetime, including infectious, metabolic, autoimmune, paraneoplastic, nutritional or toxic triggers.  Signs and symptoms  Diplopia is a symptom that individuals with cerebellar degeneration may experience. Patients suffering from cerebellar degeneration experience a progressive loss of nerve cells (Purkinje cells) throughout the cerebellum. As well as this, it is common to incur an elevated blood protein level and a high volume of lymph cells within the cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in swelling and enlargement of the brain. The most characteristic signs and symptoms experienced by patients with cerebellar degeneration include: * muscle weakness *an uncoordinated, staggering walk * quivering of the torso * jerky arm and leg movements *tendency to falling over * dysarthria (difficulty in articulating speech) * dysphagia (difficulty in deglutition/swallowing of solids and liquids) * vertigo (dizziness) * nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movements), causing sleep disturbances * ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of extraocular muscles) * diplopia (double vision) Scientific studies have revealed that psychiatric symptoms are also common in patients with cerebellar degeneration, where dementia is a typical psychiatric disorder resulting from cerebellar damage. Approximately 50% of all patients suffer from dementia as a result of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.  Causes  The root cause of incurring a cerebellar degenerative condition can be due to a range of different inherited or acquired (non-genetic and non-inherited) conditions, including neurological diseases, paraneoplastic disorders, nutritional deficiency, and chronic alcohol abuse. = Neurological diseases = A neurological disease refers to any ailment of the central nervous system, including abnormalities of the brain, spinal cord and other connecting nerve fibres.. Where millions of people are affected by neurological diseases on a worldwide scale,. it has been identified that the number of different types of neurological diseases exceeds six hundred,. any of which an individual can incur. Some of the most prevalent types include Alzheimer's disease, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and stroke.Agamanolis D. \\"Ataxia and cerebellar degeneration\\". neuropathology-web.org. Retrieved 2018-10-09. More specifically, the neurological diseases that can cause cerebellar degeneration include:\\"Spinocerebellar ataxia\\". Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) ‚Äì an NCATS Program. U.S. National Institutes of Health. Retrieved 2018-10-09. Diagram of two different nerve cells. The diagram on the left shows a nerve cell that is healthy and normally-functioning. The diagram on the right shows a nerve cell with a damaged myelin sheath, being the cause of multiple sclerosis.  Inherited  * Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), which refers to a group of conditions caused by mutations in the genes of a human, and are characterised by degenerative changes to many parts of the central nervous system, inclusive of the cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. If a parent is affected by SCA, each of their children will have a 50% risk of inheriting the mutated gene. * Multiple sclerosis (MS), a progressive and incurable condition caused by the combination of an individual's genetic influences and environmental circumstances. It occurs when the myelin sheath of the nerve cells becomes damaged. As the myelin sheath is responsible for protecting the nerves and conducting rapid impulses between them, any damage to this lipid-rich layer will result in delayed and interrupted nerve impulses to and from the brain.  Non-inherited  *Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which refers to a combination of diseases caused by the subsistence of foreign proteins in the blood, called prions. Prions originate in the bloodstream via ingestion of contaminated foods or through contact with contaminated medical instruments, body fluids, or infected tissue. This causes severe inflammation of the brain, impairing one's memory, personality and muscular coordination. *Acute & haemorrhagic stroke, resulting in the death of neurons in the cerebellum due to a disrupted flow of oxygen to the brain. This disrupted flow may be due to one of two causes; either a narrowing or blocked artery which derives from a build-up of plaque in the inner walls of the coronary arteries, or a ruptured blood vessel, commonly deriving from high blood pressure or head trauma. = Paraneoplastic disorders = Paraneoplastic disorders are a combination of non-inherited conditions that are activated by an individual's autoimmune response to a malignant tumour. These disorders prevail when T-cells (also known as white blood cells) begin to harm familiar cells in the central nervous system rather than the cancerous cells, resulting in degeneration of neurons in the cerebellum. Other signs and symptoms that commonly result from the incursion of a paraneoplastic disorder include an impaired ability to talk, walk, sleep, maintain balance and coordinate muscle activity, as well as experiencing seizures and hallucinations. Paraneoplastic disorders are prevalent among middle-aged individuals, typically those suffering from lung, lymphatic, ovarian or breast cancer. = Nutritional deficiency = Nutritional deficiency relates to an insufficient amount of macronutrients and micronutrients being provided to the body. Nutrient deficiencies are most prevalent among infants, the elderly, the poverty-stricken, and individuals with eating disorders. Chronic alcohol abuse is the diagnosis of which an individual frequently consumes excessive amounts of alcohol, and thus becomes dependent on the intoxicating substance. Studies show that men of every age group consume more alcohol than women, where the prevalence is higher in some regions of the world than others, such as across Western Europe and Australia. Both nutritional deficiency and chronic alcohol abuse are non-inherited conditions that lead to impaired absorption or utilisation of the vitamin thiamine (B-1) by the body, thus causing temporary or permanent damage to cerebellar cells. Alcoholic degeneration of cerebellar cells is the most common trigger of spinocerebellar ataxia.  Diagnosis  Magnetic resonance imaging scans of two different brains. The scan of the brain on the left indicates a weakened, deteriorated cerebellum of a human with cerebellar degeneration. The scan of the brain on the right indicates a healthy, normally-functioning cerebellum of a human. To select an appropriate and accurate diagnostic test for cerebellar degeneration, it is crucial that a range of factors specific to each patient are taken into consideration. These include; the patient's age, acuity of their signs and symptoms, associated neurological conditions, and family history of hereditary forms of cerebellar degeneration. A diagnosis for cerebellar degeneration is regarded after any of the aforementioned signs and symptoms surface. For genetically-classified forms of cerebellar degeneration, genetic testing can be carried out in order to confirm or deny the diagnosis, where this form of testing is only possible if the gene responsible for the cause of the condition is recognised. In saying this, for most conditions the genetic cause of cerebellar degeneration is unidentified, hence these patients cannot proceed with genetic testing. In cases where cerebellar degeneration is acquired, a diagnosis can be established using imaging methods such as computerised tomography (CT scans) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), necessary to detect brain abnormalities in patients suffering from cerebellar degeneration.  Treatment  Like any other disease, treatment for cerebellar degeneration is contingent on the underlying cause, unique to each patient. As of present time, hereditary forms of cerebellar degeneration are incurable, though they can be managed. Management is centred around coping with symptoms and improving a patient's quality of life. In these cases, immediate management of inherited cerebellum damage should involve consultation with a neurologist, followed by specific management approaches based on the signs and symptoms experienced by each unique patient. These management approaches aim to provide supportive care to the patient, consisting of physical therapy to strengthen muscles, occupational therapy, and speech pathology. Long-term management of inherited cerebellar degeneration involves an ongoing commitment to supportive care therapies, as well as a longitudinal relationship with a neurologist. In some instances adjustments need to be made in the patients home, to improve accessibility and mobility in and around their living environment, to optimise safety. For non-hereditary types of cerebellar degeneration, some physical and mental indicators can be reversed by treating the fundamental cause. For instance, the signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration can be managed by initially terminating the underlying cancer with treatments such as surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In cases of nutritional or alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, symptoms of these conditions can be relieved by initially consuming a balanced diet and discontinuing the consumption of alcohol respectively, followed by dietary supplementation with thiamine.  Prognosis  The long-term prospect for patients suffering from cerebellar degeneration differs according to the underlying cause of the disease. Each inherited or acquired disease that results in cerebellar degeneration has its own specific prognosis, however most are generally poor, progressive and often fatal.  Epidemiology  Cerebellar degeneration continues to carry a considerable burden on the health of the world population, as well as on health agencies and governing bodies across the globe. Cerebellum-related disorders generally transpire in individuals between the ages of 45 to 65 years, however the age of symptomatic onset differs in accordance with the underlying cause of the degenerative disorder. For paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, the average age of onset is 50 years, generally affecting a greater population of males than females. Nutritional and alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, being more prevalent than paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, affects individuals with a thiamine deficiency and dipsomaniacs, respectively. Recent epidemiological studies on cerebellar degeneration estimated a global prevalence rate of 26 per 100,000 cases of cerebellar degeneration in children.

It is named after Baron Freyberg who was a prominent soldier and the first New Zealand-raised Governor-General of New Zealand.  History  The square was first opened in 1946, and the decision to name it Freyberg Place was befitting, given that it is a small square and Freyberg's nickname was \\"Tiny\\". The square underwent significant renovations, costing $4 million, and was reopened on 15 September 2017. It now contains a pohutukawa tree, some nikau palms and many concrete steps which double as seating. Contained within the square is an ornamental fountain and statue of Baron Freyberg in his World War 2 attire. After the renovation, the road that traversed the square was made into a shared space. Later, in 2018, it was proposed that this be converted completely to a pedestrian mall with bollard access available to emergency vehicles only.  Surroundings  Freyberg Place is located between High St and O'Connell St, near the centre of Auckland's CBD. It is adjacent to Chancery Square and serves as frontage to the Ellen Melville Centre which was opened in 1962. One the other side of the square, there is the Metropolis building.

Dewell and his wife, Celia H. Elliott, were the first white permanent settlers in Lake County, California. Dewell was a member of the \\"Bear Flag Party\\" and participated in the Bear Flag Revolt. Early life Benjamin Dewell was born in 1821 in Jefferson County, Ohio. In 1840, Dewell moved with his family to Indiana. He was hired in 1845 to serve as a drover for William Bell Elliott, based in Dade County, Missouri. That same year, Dewell traveled with Elliott and his family to California on a wagon train. Dewell settled in Napa County, California in October, spending the winter in Calistoga. In 1846, he moved to Sonoma. Bear Flag Rebellion and Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War By 1846, Dewell was living in Sonoma, California, where the Elliot family lived. Upon his arrival, Dewell became a supporter of the California Republic and fought in the Bear Flag Revolt. The wife of William Elliot provided flannel that would comprise the California Republic flag that was raised on the Sonoma Plaza on the day of the revolt and her daughter, Celia, would help sew the flag. After the revolt, Dewell joined John C. Fr√©mont's California Battalion. The Battalion was sent to Los Angeles in late 1846. Upon arrival the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed, and there were no further armed conflicts of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in California. Dewell returned to Sonoma, settling in Rancho Los Guilicos, where he would become involved in ranching. Life in Lake County Dewell married William Elliott's daughter, Celia, on May 5, 1850, in Santa Rosa, California. On May 24, 1854, the couple moved to Lake County, California. They were the first white people to move permanently to the county. On their move, they brought with them 22 horses and 100 cattle and the settled just north of the then village of Upper Lake, California. Dewell acquired the land by visiting Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo. He lived the remainder of his life at his ranch in Upper Lake. Dewell sold a portion of his ranch land to a Mr. McCray, which would become the founding plot of land for Upper Lake. Dewell was active in local politics, helping to shape local affairs with his opinion and advice. The Dewell's were not active churchgoers, however, they helped build the first founding churches of Upper Lake.

In the beginning of the organization's activism, their definition for sexual harassment was \\"the treatment of women workers as sexual objects,\\" but the organization did not specify which behaviors constituted such harassment.Loy, Pamela Hewitt, and Lea P. Stewart. \\"The extent and effects of the sexual harassment of working women.\\" Sociological focus 17, no. 1 (1984): 31-43. Carmita Wood The founding of the group was inspired by the case of Carmita Wood, who quit her job at Cornell University due to sexual harassment and became one of the first women in the US to sue her employer on such grounds.Fitzgerald, Louise F. \\"Sexual harassment: The definition and measurement of a construct.\\" Ivory power: Sexual harassment on campus 21, no. 22 (1990): 24-30. In 1975, Carmita Wood quit her position at Cornell University due to harassment from her supervisor, Boyce McDaniel, and the University's refusal to approve her request for a transfer. Subsequently, Wood filed for unemployment benefits from the university. Cornell refused to approve the benefits, stating Wood had quit for \\"personal reasons.\\" Working Women United was active in response to the incident and Wood's subsequent lawsuit. Cornell instructor Lin Farley, a key organiser in Working Women United, used the phrase \\"sexual harassment\\" at a hearing, and The New York Times reported on the hearing and the phrase used, helping to introduce the concept and phrase \\"sexual harassment\\" into the national lexicon. Ane Becker On April 15, 1975 Ane Becker filed a complaint with the New York State Human Rights Commission against her employer, Borg Warner, an international automotive supply corporation, alleging sexual discrimination. She did this on her own. Shortly thereafter the WWU hearing of her situation in the local media reached out to offer their support and guidance. With no resources she gratefully accepted their support. Following on July 24, 1975 with the support of the WWU she filed suit against Morse Chain division of Borg Warner in Ithaca NY alleging sexual discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission. Ms. Becker an employee of 17 years said she‚Äôd been denied equal opportunities protected by the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Ms. Becker had worked as a purchasing in clerk for 13 years. She claimed that her responsibilities were virtually the same as the buyers making $30-$96 more per week. ‚ÄúIf I had been a man, and done exactly what I have, the same thing, I would‚Äôve been promoted 13 years ago‚Äù Ms. Yacknin of the WWU agreed that Ane Becker‚Äôs case met many criteria for a discrimination case. Ms. Yacknin said ‚Äúthere are no women buyers at the Morse Chain Ithaca plant, and there has not been for at least the past 18 years.‚Äù ‚ÄúWorking women United believes that this situation indicates discrimination in hiring, promotion, wages, training, and titles,‚Äù she said. Ms. Becker said that she had been ‚Äúterribly nervous‚Äù for a long time to take that first step. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have the guts for a long time, but I have a small son, and my finances were (less) drastic.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo I dared,‚Äù Becker said. (Ithaca Journal, July 24, 1975) In November 1975, with the support from the WWU Becker was victorious in her lawsuit. Although Borg Warner automotive denied any wrongdoing, Ms. Becker was promoted to a Buyer classification, given a pay raise and two years of backpay. (Ithaca Journal, November 8, 1975) Ane Becker retired from Borg Warner in 1988 after 30 years of service. Following her retirement she was routinely called back to work as a buyer for many years. Ane Becker died in 2015 at the age of 89 and is remembered as a loving, feisty and independent spirit who championed change in the workplace to help women become more valued.  History  In the mid-1970's, the feminist movement created social and conceptual spaces where women could speak out on the job about sexual harassment. As women had done previously with abortion, rape, and domestic abuse, identifying and speaking out about the violation legitimized their feelings of violation. This time, they focused on sexual harassment in the workplace, and the case of Carmita Wood inspired the movement. She was declined unemployment benefits when resigning as an administrative assistant to a professor at Cornell University because she had been physically ill from the pressure of avoiding his unwanted sexual advances. The first organized response to sexual harassment grew out of the women's movement, arising at the intersection between protests against sexism in jobs and feminist opposition to violence against women. The problem of sexual harassment placed together complaints about women working in the workforce with opposition to male sexual violence. Two groups founded in the mid-1970's to concentrate specifically on sexual harassment ‚Äî Working Women United in Ithaca, New York, and the Cambridge, Massachusetts Alliance Against Sexual Coercion. On a Sunday afternoon, 4 May 1975, 275 women gathered for the country's initial speech opposing sexual assault at the Greater Ithaca Activities Center. Working Women United (WWU), as well as the Human Affairs Program at Cornell University and the National Organization for Women's Chapter in Ithaca. This campaign developed out of the wider women's movement, which provided the leaders of the fight against sexual assault with an institutional foundation, contact networks, policies, and philosophy.

Cummings served as the University of Arizona‚Äôs 9th president (1927-28), Arizona State Museum‚Äôs first director (1915-38), founding head of UofA's Department of Archaeology (1915-37), and the founder of the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society (est. 1916). Cummings was by all accounts a remarkable man. Remembered as the Dean of Southwestern Archaeology, he was an energetic teacher and brilliant scholar. He was also an American football coach and professor at the University of Utah. He served as the head football coach at the University of Utah 1897 where he was also a professor from 1893 to 1915. He later served as a professor at the University of Arizona, where he became president. Southwestern archaeology Professor Cummings did pioneering archaeological fieldwork in the early 1900s in southern Utah's San Juan country. Archaeologist Neil Judd, then Cummings' student, assisted in this work, as did other of Cummings' field students. Cummings was the first to discover Pleistocene man in southern Arizona and his discoveries led to the eventual recognition of the Cochise culture that has been dated to before 6,000 B.C. He authored numerous articles, pamphlets and books about Southwestern cultures based on the sites and ruins he explored. One of his dreams was realized when in 1936 the doors of a new Arizona State Museum building were opened to the public. He retired from the department of archaeology in 1937 and from the museum in 1938, but remained Director Emeritus until his death in Tucson in 1954 at the age of 93.  Discovery of Rainbow Bridge, 1909  Prof. Cummings was co-head of the US party attempting to be the first Americans to visit this landmark, along with William B. Douglass, Examiner of Surveys for the General Land Office. John Wetherill organized the Cummings expedition. There had been apparent friction between Cummings and Douglass over who would be the first to visit Rainbow Bridge. On August 14, 1909, the party reached the Bridge. Cummings and Douglass both spurred their horses in an attempt to be the first Americans to ride under the bridge. John Wetherill saw what was happening and, being closer to the bridge, went on ahead and rode first under the span. Judging Byron and Isabelle Cummings by the Content of Their Character, by David R.

It's located at the western edge of the Cascade Range on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The Pulpit is more notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. The nearest higher peak is Preacher Mountain, to the southeast. Precipitation runoff from The Pulpit drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. Climate The Pulpit is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The Pulpit (left) with Preacher Mountain Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Cascade Range.

It was written by showrunner Angela Kang and directed by executive producer Greg Nicotero. This episode marks the final appearance of Xander Berkeley (Gregory), who first appeared in the sixth season episode \\"Knots Untie\\". The episode was dedicated to Scott Wilson, the actor who played Hershel Greene during seasons 2-4, who died the day before the episode's first broadcast. Plot Eighteen months have passed since Rick defeated Negan. The communities of Alexandria, the Hilltop, the Kingdom, Oceanside, and the Sanctuary have rebuilt what they can to make more viable societies. Rick and Michonne are raising Judith and overseeing Alexandria. Maggie has given birth to her and Glenn's child, which she named for her father Hershel. She has defeated Gregory in an election to be leader of Hilltop, but is still distressed about Rick's decision to keep Negan alive. Carol and Ezekiel at the Kingdom have grown as a couple. Daryl and Eugene oversee the remaining Saviors at the Sanctuary, where infertile ground makes it difficult to grow anything. Rick leads a group up into the remains of Washington, D.C. to salvage pioneering supplies, such as plows, canoes, seed samples, and a covered wagon from a museum. This is made difficult by the need to cross over a floor made of weakened glass, under which a horde of walkers have amassed. Ezekiel falls through on the last crossing, but they have tied themselves together with ropes to catch each other, and Carol and others quickly rescue him. They head back to the communities with their haul. They find a recent rainstorm has raised water levels in a river and destroyed one of the bridges towards Hilltop. While Rick suggests they can get to Alexandria and wait out the water levels, Maggie wants to get back to her child at Hilltop, and lets Rick's group take the supplies to Alexandria. Rick's group continues on but the wagon gets stuck in a muddy part of the road. As walkers bear down on them, they decide to abandon the supplies and come back for them later. Ken goes back to cut loose the horses, but ends up bitten by a walker. Despite them amputating his arm and immediate medical care, he still dies. Some time later, Maggie talks to Tammy and Earl Rose, Ken's parents, who are angry their son died for nothing of value since the supplies will ultimately go to the Saviors at the Sanctuary. They hold a funeral for Ken overseen by Gregory. Later, Gregory talks to Earl over a shot of whiskey, suggesting that the election was illegitimate and that others, like himself, are angry. Rick, Daryl and Michonne bring the recovered supplies to the Sanctuary. Daryl sees graffiti on the walls still proclaiming loyalty to Negan. Daryl talks with Rick about no longer wanting to be the one in charge of the Sanctuary, and prefers the old way of being in smaller groups with people he can trust. Carol talks to Daryl alone, and offers to take over the Sanctuary for him, as she is somewhat concerned that Ezekiel has indicated he wants to marry her. Michonne, after seeing Negan's name at the wall at Sanctuary and inspired by a display at the museum, suggests to Rick that they establish a charter between the communities to act as a new code of laws. At Hilltop, Maggie is walking Hershel to sleep when Gregory tells her someone has defaced Glenn's grave. She goes there but is assaulted by a hooded man. Enid and others come to her rescue, revealing the man to be Earl. Maggie accosts Gregory, who does not deny his act, and taunts her that she will refuse to run off to Alexandria for help because Negan is being held prisoner there. Gregory attempts to kill Maggie but she overpowers him. The next day, Rick and Michonne come to visit Hilltop, and Rick tries to get Maggie to agree to give supplies to the Sanctuary and help with repairing the bridge. She asserts that she will only provide supplies if the Sanctuary supply half the workforce for the work on the bridge. Maggie tells Rick that she's no longer following his way. Before they leave, Maggie has Gregory hanged while Rick and Michonne look on in horror. Production Xander Berkeley made his final regular appearance as Gregory in this episode. \\"A New Beginning\\" represents the first episode of several changes to the series. It is the first episode with Angela Kang as the showrunner, taking over for Scott M. Gimple who will oversee the Walking Dead franchise for AMC. It also represents the last season for Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes, who had announced his departure from the show earlier in 2018. To facilitate this, several elements of \\"A New Beginning\\" are designed to accommodate Lincoln's departure. According to Kang, they continued the hostility between Rick and Maggie over differences of how Rick saved Negan's life, and expanding that to some of Rick's other closer allies. Thus, the washed-out bridge that must be fixed and serves as a plot element for several more episodes was envisioned as a literal representation of the bridge that Rick needs to make to his friends and allies to keep the various communities working together, according to Kang. The episode includes the death of main character Gregory, played by Xander Berkeley. Prior to season 9, Berkeley said that there had been some long-term plan for Gregory's death, stating that \\"There's only so long a douchebag like Gregory can stay alive\\". With season 9's change in showrunner alongside the changes necessary to accommodate the departure of Lincoln and the limited schedule of Lauren Cohan, Berkeley learned his character's death had been pushed up much sooner, which he learned nearly last minute. Berkeley had no qualms about the change, and considered that being hanged would add to his actor's portfolio of deaths from previous works. Gregory's death was adapted from the comic book in issue #141, where Gregory similarly plotted for Maggie's death due to being ousted as Hilltop's leader, and Maggie opted to hang him as punishment.

Filming of the museum scenes primarily took place at the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta across two days. The production team created a fake glass floor made of plexiglass to use at the base of the building's staircase for some of the scenes. The episode was dedicated to memory of Scott Wilson, the actor for Hershel Greene on the series. Wilson died on October 6, 2018, shortly after news earlier that day that he had already reprised his role of Hershel for season 9.

It was written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer. Plot Rick speaks to an unseen individual about the status of the communities over the past month as they work to rebuild the washed-out bridge. Earlier that day, Rick oversees the makeshift camp where most of his close allies help to watch over the Saviors as they labor in rebuilding the bridge. Eugene keeps him up to date on progress, noting that they have not been able to account for a half-dozen Savior walk-offs, and that they plan to detonate a roadblock later that day and their plans to route a nearby walker horde away using sirens. Rick sees Siddiq has trained Enid in basic field medic work, and has Siddiq return to the safety of the communities. Carol and Ezekiel discuss their relationship, and Anne and Fr. Gabriel start to recognize a bond between them. During work, as Henry is passing out water, Justin, a Savior, tries to take more than his share and pushes Henry. Daryl rushes in to subdue Justin before Rick can assert his control on the group. Rick and Daryl realize the Saviors are starting to get out of hand, due to Rick's hurry to finish the bridge and the lack of food. Later, they set off the dynamite, and track the nearby walker horde as it diverts towards the first siren. However, when the second siren, manned by Justin, fails to sound, Rick realizes the group of men at a logging site nearby are in trouble. There, Daryl sees the horde and orders everyone to flee, but in the haste, Aaron's arm is crushed under a giant log. Rick and the others arrive to help defend them, allowing Daryl to rush Aaron to the medical tent. Enid is flummoxed at the injury and determines the only action they can take is to amputate Aaron's arm. The surgery is successful, but Rick takes full blame for Aaron's loss. Rick chastises Justin for failing to sound the alarm. Justin claims their radio equipment failed, but when Rick refuses to accept this excuse, he walks off. Michonne goes to the Hilltop to speak to Maggie. Michonne knows that the Hilltop was waiting for a supply of ethanol being produced at the Sanctuary, which they would exchange for food to provide to the Saviors, but the supply has gone missing; Michonne requests Maggie provide the food on trust that they will get the ethanol. Maggie refuses, pointing out that they have no fuel for their tractor, and with Earl, their blacksmith, being held in custody, they cannot repair the plow they took from the museum, and thus must conserve their food supply. Michonne urges Maggie to reconsider, but Maggie remains steadfast that Earl must be punished. Maggie does allow Tammy to see Earl under her watch, and learns that Earl's actions were a result of Gregory giving him his first drink of alcohol in years. After some time, Maggie relents; she allows Earl to return to his blacksmith work under guard, and agrees to provide the food to Michonne, as well as being open to discuss a code of laws between the communities, as long as she retains some authority at Hilltop. That night, Rick's conversation continues, revealed to be with Negan, who is held in a cell within Alexandria. Negan cares little for how Rick is rebuilding the communities, believing that Rick is just helping to repair the world for him. Anne keeps watch at night and spots a helicopter flying overhead. Justin, walking alone back to Sanctuary, appears to see someone he recognizes before the figure jumps and attacks him.

It was written by Corey Reed and directed by Dan Liu. Plot Construction on the bridge continues. As she promised to Michonne, Maggie brings a wagon load of supplies from the Hilltop to the Sanctuary when she is stopped by a group of Saviors who are looking for their missing member, Justin. Some of the Saviors start calling Maggie \\"the Widow\\", the name Negan had used demeaningly, but Arat and Laura, two of the lead Saviors, quickly put a stop to it. As they discuss this, the re-animated body of Justin appears from the woods. After they put it down, it is clear that Justin had died by human hands before reanimating. As word of Justin's murder spreads, tempers start to flare at the construction camp between the Saviors and the other groups. Rick arrives in time to stop any immediate violence and promises the Saviors they will investigate. Rick starts talking to his own people to see if they saw anything. Fr. Gabriel, who was to be on watch with Anne but had secretly stepped away, reports seeing nothing. Daryl is somewhat affronted when Rick suggests he might have killed Justin. Gabriel speaks to Anne later, but she affirms she saw nothing, though in reality she had seen a helicopter pass over. Anne expresses concern that she feels she is distrusted by the Saviors, having been called \\"the Garbage Lady\\". Rick decides to pair off several teams to look for clues in the area for Justin's killer. One team includes Maggie and Cyndie, who find walkers being drawn towards a house where a piece of sheet metal hangs off its roof, making noise. As they approach the house to clear it out and stop the noise, Cyndie explains this is where some of her Oceanside members used to live before Simon and the Saviors came and killed all their men. Maggie and Cyndie work to clear the house but get into a bit of trouble just before Rick and other pairs arrive, dispatching the walkers. They find one team, Arat and Beatrice, that should have been closer to help not present, and out of radio contact. They go looking for the two, and eventually find Beatrice knocked unconscious, while Arat's things have been left on the ground nearby. Regrouping at camp, Rick and his most trusted allies decide to break off and search again, but without any Savior help, in case they are at fault. Rick and Carol go off as one group, and they run into some of the Saviors led by Jed. Jed holds Carol under a knife, demanding Rick drop his weapon so they can safely return to Sanctuary, but Carol manages to overpower Jed and stab him in the shoulder. Daryl and Maggie find a few walker bodies, one with a harpoon through it, and follow them back to a recover center building where several Oceanside members, including Cyndie and Beatrice, are holding Arat. Cyndie reveals they have been the ones behind some of the Savior deaths, getting back at those that had murdered their husbands, sons, and brothers, justified by Maggie's decision to hang Gregory. Arat was responsible for Cyndie's brother's death, and Cyndie remembers what Arat had said when they executed their men: \\"No exceptions\\". After hearing this, Maggie and Daryl turn away, while Cyndie executes Arat. Anne returns to the Scavengers' junk yard. She locates a hidden cache and recovers a radio with which she makes a call requesting a pickup by helicopter. The male voice on the other end asks if she has an \\"A\\" or a \\"B\\", but she has neither. The man tells her to be ready the next day but only if she has an \\"A\\". As the call ends, Anne sees that Gabriel had followed her there and overheard the call. Gabriel deduces that Anne had previously traded people to this unknown agent for supplies, and had planned to do that with both Rick and him earlier. Anne suggests that if he helps her, he could also possibly join them. Gabriel refuses and plans to tell Rick, but Anne stops him. She tells him she once thought of him as a \\"B\\" but he might be the \\"A\\" she needs. The next day, the bulk of the Saviors leave the construction camp to return to Sanctuary. Maggie and Daryl walk along a different path; Maggie tells Daryl they tried Rick's way, and it failed to work, so now they need to take another direction, and it is time to meet Negan. Development and production The cabin which Maggie and Cyndie clear out of walkers was arranged to be a homage to George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead. The setting around the cabin includes a burnt-out gas pump and a pickup truck, the latter with the charred remains of a passenger, an Easter egg to events from the film. Anne's \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" were elements that the production team had laid in before in earlier episodes in Season 8, where Rick, having being taken prisoner by Anne (Jadis at the time), kept him locked up in a storage container labeled \\"A\\". This episode marks the departure of the recurring characters Arat (Elizabeth Ludlow) and Justin (Zach McGowan), due to their characters being killed by Beatrice (Briana Venskus).

It was written by Geraldine Inoa and directed by Rosemary Rodriguez. Plot In Alexandria, Michonne oversees the community, raising Judith, and writing her proposed code of laws for the communities, but at night, ventures out to fend off walkers. During one event, she loses her katana briefly, and finds the closest weapon at hand to defend herself, a baseball bat. This causes her to start considering Negan, held within a cell inside Alexandria. She goes to see him after learning he is on a hunger strike. The two talk about their past, Negan having lost his wife Lucille, and Michonne having lost her own son Andre. When Negan asks what happened to his baseball bat, \\"Lucille\\", Michonne asserts it's still out there somewhere, causing Negan to fall into anguish. At the Scavengers' junkyard, Anne has secured Gabriel and threatens to let loose an armless walker on him. Gabriel tries to convince her to let him go, apologizing for his own past mistakes. Anne cannot bring herself to kill him, and instead knocks him out. When Gabriel awakes he finds himself alone in the junkyard, a note from Anne in his coat explaining that she has left for places unknown. Maggie, Daryl, and the Oceanside group conspire to assassinate Negan. They know Rick will not let Maggie into Alexandria as she has made her intentions clear, and start to work out a plan to bring Maggie into Alexandria without Rick's knowledge. Jesus, who is hesitant about this course of action, covertly contacts Rick to warn him. Rick is overseeing the takedown of the bridge-construction camp, as without the Saviors, it is unlikely they will be able to finish the bridge in time before rising waters wash it away. Eugene warns Rick of two large hordes seen in the area, but both are moving divergent to their routes. Rick gets Jesus' word, and decides to head to Alexandria. He contacts one of the Alexandria watch points to tell them to be on the lookout for Maggie, unaware that the watch point is a member of Oceanside and complicit in Maggie's plan. When Rick prepares to go by horseback, Daryl offers to drive him there instead via motorcycle. Rick becomes concerned when Daryl purposely misses the turnoff for Alexandria. He demands Daryl stop the bike, and the two get into a fistfight. Both end up falling into a deep pit off the road that they cannot easily climb out of. They realize their conflict, with Daryl reminding how many people have helped him and how some of his decisions have come to hurt those and others, like Glenn. The two agree to work together to escape the pit. At the construction camp, the remaining survivors are preparing to move out when a group of Saviors, led by Jed, hold them at gunpoint. He demands the group turn over weapons for the Saviors to protect themselves, since they know Oceanside has been killing off the other Saviors. Carol lowers her weapon, but when Judd approaches her, the Oceanside survivors intervene. A firefight breaks out, Rick and Daryl hear the sounds of gunfire and rush to escape. Just as they start clearing the edge, walkers from one of the approaching hordes, drawn by the sound of gunfire, start falling into the pit, but both still manage to get out alive. Rick sees a loose horse nearby and offers to lead the walker horde away from the camp while Daryl drives off to warn them. Rick, on horseback, leads the horde along but is surprised when the other horde that Eugene warned him of is converging on the same point. The horse becomes frightened by the two hordes and rears, knocking Rick off its back. Rick lands hard on a concrete block and finds a piece of rebar has impaled his side, and is unable to move. Rick loses consciousness as the two hordes converge on him.  Production  The scene between Rick and Daryl was added to this episode based on how showrunner Angela Kang had seen Daryl's actor, Norman Reedus, act during the finale of \\"Wrath\\", where Maggie reacts vengefully at Rick's decision to keep Negan alive. Kang said that Reedus had played that scene representing Daryl's distributed state, feeling the need to help out Maggie but wanting to stay loyal to Rick. As part of closing out Rick's arc, they wanted to have closure on that angle, and thus crafted this scene for the two characters to come to terms. Kang worked with the scriptwriter Geraldine Inoa, her premiere story on the show, and with both Lincoln and Reedus to establish the dialog and actions for the scene. With Rick's departure from the show, they instead put Michonne in Rick's role from the comic series with respect to Negan, become a person that Negan connects through in somewhat contentious ways.

The episode's teleplay was written by Matthew Negrete, from a story by Scott M. Gimple and Negrete, and it was directed by Greg Nicotero. In the episode, a heavily-wounded Rick Grimes struggles to divert a zombie herd while he questions his legacy in maintaining his vision of the united communities. This episode included guest appearances by former regular cast members Jon Bernthal (Shane Walsh), Sarah Wayne Callies (Lori Grimes), Sonequa Martin-Green (Sasha Williams), and Scott Wilson (Hershel Greene). It was Wilson's penultimate on-screen appearance before his death. It also marks the final appearances of Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes), and Pollyanna McIntosh (Anne). It was also the last appearance for Lauren Cohan (Maggie Greene) in the season, due to other acting commitments. She returned to the show in late season 10 and will be a series regular in season 11, the final one. Plot Rick manages to pry himself off the rebar he had been impaled on after being thrown off by his spooked horse, but is bleeding profusely. He makes it back to his horse, barely holding onto consciousness to lead the merged walker hordes away from the construction camp. Getting enough of a lead, he finds an abandoned cabin nearby to create makeshift bandages, before leading the hordes onwards. Throughout this, Rick falls in and out of consciousness and has lucid dreams of him trying to find his family, which includes conversations with Shane and Hershel, both of whom urge him to wake back up to reality and stay ahead of the horde. In another vision, he walks onto a field filled with the bodies of all his friends, where he speaks to Sasha, who reminds him that all that he has done has been for the good of all. Sasha tells him that he will find his family, as they are not lost. Anne is trying to make her way to a planned rendezvous point, and told by the man on the other end of the walkie- talkie that she had misled them before. She assures them she has the \\"A\\" they need and needs to get out of this place. Maggie continues onto Alexandria; Michonne hears of this and intercepts her before she reaches the cage where Negan is being kept. Maggie is able to convince Michonne to hand over the keys, telling her she will be able to live with this decision. Negan taunts Maggie over his enjoyment of killing Glenn, but Maggie remains steadfast. Negan soon starts begging her to kill him. Thinking it another trick, Maggie pulls Negan out of the cell into the light (wanting to see his face as she kills him), seeing that he has become a weak, desperate man, who begs to be killed to be with his wife. Maggie puts him back in his cell, walking out satisfied with a better understanding of why Rick kept him alive. They then hear word of trouble outside, and race to see what is happening with other residents. Rick wakes from his last lucid dream with Sasha to find himself at the now-abandoned camp, with the horse having fled. With walkers closing in on him, Rick keeps on leading them towards the bridge. He stumbles just short of the bridge, but as the walkers near him, Michonne leads a large group of his allies to dispatch the walkers. Michonne urges Rick to keep on fighting, and Rick comes to realize that Michonne is now his family. He realizes this is just another vision; he finds himself alone just off the bridge with the horde still following him. He gets back up and continues to lead the walkers across the bridge as the river waters rise. To Rick's dismay, the weight of the walkers is not sufficient to cause the bridge to fall. A group from the united communities ‚Äì including Saviors ‚Äì arrive and begin killing off the walkers near Rick. Maggie worries that if the walkers cross, they will continue onto Hilltop, and leads a group to try to turn the horde around, but Rick waves them off, muttering to himself that he found his family. Rick sees some of the dynamite left on the bridge, and fires at it, destroying the bridge and most of the walker horde, the remaining horde continuing on and falling into the river. To his allies, Rick appears to have been lost in the explosion, and several break out in tears and grief at his loss. Anne sees the smoke from the explosion and chatter over the walkie-talkies about Rick's action while a helicopter lands nearby. She sees Rick on the bank of the river, still alive. She tells the pilot that she has a \\"B\\", and convinces the helicopter to rescue Rick. She and Rick are airlifted away to places unknown. Six years later, a small group of survivors, Magna, Connie, Kelly, Yumiko, and Luke are trying to hold off a walker horde when a few are shot from a forest nearby. The group is told to take cover, and find that they have been rescued by a now-preteen Judith.  Production  This episode marks the last appearance of both Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes) as well as Pollyanna McIntosh (Jadis/Anne). Both actors have been confirmed to take a role in a series of three AMC Original Films to continue Rick's story, with production on the first to start in 2019. Lincoln had been working with Scott Gimple, the former showrunner and now current content manager for all of AMC's The Walking Dead properties, about how Rick's story could continue for some time. They had established early on that it needed to involve Jadis and the helicopter, and established these elements in earlier seasons to prepare for this point. Showrunner Angela Kang also confirmed that this episode would be the last episode of this season for Lauren Cohan as Maggie, due to previous commitments she had made for the show Whiskey Cavalier prior to signing on for the ninth season, though it is uncertain yet if she will return to the show; Kang stated they have additional stories they can tell with Maggie's character should Cohan be able to return. As to close out Maggie's story, they introduced the scene with Maggie and Negan which took place much later in the comic book series (after the introduction of the Whisperers). This gave them a way to move Maggie forward and beyond her obsession with Negan, should Cohan be able to return. The cabin that Rick stops to rest was modeled after the cabin from the film The Evil Dead, including a replica of its Necronomicon on the table. The episode's producer, Greg Nicotero, had previously worked on Evil Dead 2. All of the lucid dream shots were filmed on a sound stage at Raleigh Studios, using green-screen effects for the backgrounds. These scenes were to play on the Third Man factor, bringing in people from Rick's past that would help keep him moving as he struggled with his blood loss. This led to some discussion about whom to bring back for these shots between Kang and writers Scott Gimple and Matt Negrete, needed characters that were essential to Rick. Shane, as played by Jon Bernthal, was considered essential given Shane's impact on Rick's story throughout the show. Hershel as played by Scott Wilson was seen as a father- figure to Rick, and Sasha as played by Sonequa Martin-Green was seen as a soldier who knew how to put the bigger picture first in her priorities. They had considered bringing back others like Steven Yeun who played Glenn, but there were scheduling conflicts, and the production felt the three guests they had worked strongest for the story. This ended up being Wilson's last on- screen role before his death; on the day that they announced that Bernthal, Wilson, and Martin-Green would return in guest roles for this episode during the 2018 New York Comic Con in October 2018, Wilson died from complications from leukemia. Additionally, former The Walking Dead actors Lennie James, Sarah Wayne Callies, Emily Kinney, and Michael Cudlitz all provided voice-line cameos as their former characters Morgan Jones, Lori Grimes, Beth Greene, and Abraham Ford respectively as part of Rick's lucid dreams. The shot of Rick walking among the bodies of those he knew include a mix of his fellow actors, body doubles of former characters, and dummies for other characters. The scene itself was inspired by one of the special covers for issue #100 of the comic book, where Glenn is killed by Negan. This scene was originally to have some of the bodies rise up to make it more harrowing towards Rick, including Negan, but this was ultimately cut. Kang stated they felt that Shane served well- enough as an antagonizing character to Rick but had a friendship and connection with him, while Negan's hostility would have been more direct. The final scenes shot for the episode involved the hospital setting where Rick first woke up in the pilot episode \\"Days Gone Bye\\", though with small changes. To further bookend Rick's arc, they reused the song \\"Space Junk\\" by Wang Chung which was also featured in \\"Days Gone Bye\\". The episode includes an estimated six-year time jump, according to Kang. The episode introduces Cailey Fleming as an older Judith, as well as the members of Magna's (Nadia Hilker) group, including Lauren Ridloff as Connie, Angel Theory as Kelly, Eleanor Matsuura as Yumiko, and Dan Fogler as Luke, who are key elements related to the Whisperers arc in the comic book series. Reception =Critical reception= \\"What Comes After\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise being aimed at Andrew Lincoln's performance and the return of Jon Bernthal as Shane Walsh. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 76% with an average score of 6.4 out of 10, based on 33 reviews, the lowest scoring episode of the season on the site.

They further discuss the situation between the Hilltop and Alexandria, the two communities having refused to work together due to past events. Later, Jesus sneaks out of Hilltop and meets with Aaron, where they practice close-quarters combat and discuss in private how they can help restore the trust between their two communities.

Luke, a former music teacher, recovers a supply of recorders he had stashed there. Michonne states that this will be as far as she goes and prepares to return to Alexandria, but Magna convinces her she needs to stay with them to argue their case to Maggie. They find shelter for the evening. During the night, Luke scavenges from junk in the building, alerting Michonne, and when he emerges with an object, she slashes it in two. He reveals that the object was a rare Stradivarius violin, one he had found earlier in their group's travels and states that he believes that by bringing art and music back, they will be able to overcome the walkers. They prepare to set out the next morning, but a walker horde has surrounded the building. The group efficiently dispatches the walkers until they see one they recognize as Bernie, a former member of Magna's group. Michonne dispatches Bernie with some degree of respect before they set out. As they near Hilltop, Michonne again states her intention to return to Alexandria, but Siddiq reveals that Maggie has long departed there. Two riders from the Hilltop come by, on their way to Alexandria to inform them about Rosita, but since they are here, the group, including Michonne, prepare to continue to Hilltop. Connie thinks she sees something in the woods, but later says it was nothing. However, unseen by the convoy, someone is spying on them as they depart. Daryl leads Carol and Henry to his camp, and introduces them to his dog, named Dog. Carol fears for Daryl's health as he has not eaten much, but Daryl has become accustomed to that, and in his course of searching for Rick Grimes' body, has gotten used to living on his own. That night, as Daryl takes Dog to check his traps, they are followed by Henry. Dog gets stuck in one of the traps, and while Daryl frees it, they are overwhelmed by walkers. Henry steps in to help dispatch them. When they return to camp, Henry explains that he's learned that it is better to look at the big picture of everyone's survival than just one person. The three continue on to Hilltop. There, they learn of Rosita's injury, and that Eugene is still out there. Aaron, Daryl and Jesus head out in search of Eugene.  Production  The episode was directed by former cast member Michael Cudlitz \\"Stradivarius\\" is the directorial debut of Michael Cudlitz, who had played Abraham Ford from seasons 4 through 7 on the show. Cudlitz said that, after his casting, he had spoken to Scott Gimple about the potential to direct episodes in the future. Cudlitz had been in line to direct episodes of Southland, a previous series he had starred in before The Walking Dead, but the show was cancelled before he could get his chance. Cudlitz and Gimple discussed this possibility during his time on the show, and Cudlitz made mention of this again after his departure. Once the new showrunner Angela Kang took over for Gimple, Gimple put her in touch with Cudlitz to explore the opportunity to direct. Knowing that Kang was giving the show a more Western feel, Cudlitz took inspiration from films like The Searchers and Shane for how to frame some of the scenes. A significant part of the episode was developing Daryl's backstory and why he had separated from the groups, as well as how he would be re-integrated. Norman Reedus, the actor that plays Daryl, scriptwriter Vivian Tse, and Cudlitz had various ideas of how these elements should play out, and the three worked to create a cohesive story that will be developed upon. Cudlitz was also responsible in this episode of making sure that an \\"X\\"-shaped scar on Daryl was featured, mimicking one seen on Michonne's back in the previous episode. Cudlitz did not fully explain the significance of the marks but indicated they were tied to the breakdown of the relationship between Michonne, Maggie, and Daryl during the time jump. The episode features a cameo appearance from C. Thomas Howell, who took the role after being asked by Cudlitz, as they \\"needed someone who could ride a horse and act.\\" Cudlitz and Howell are friends and they previously worked together on Southland. Reception =Critical reception= \\"Stradivarius\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 79% with an average score of 6.03 out of 10, based on 16 reviews.

Plot Daryl, Jesus, and Aaron follow a missing Eugene's tracks. They observe a herd of walkers milling around in the middle of a field and talk about how unusual it is of the walkers to be doing this, and decide to walk around it. As they depart, an odd looking walker watches them from the herd. Michonne, Siddiq, and DJ lead Magna's group to the Hilltop, though they are met with clear hostility. Tara explains that Eugene's still missing and that Aaron is out with Jesus searching for him. Michonne and Siddiq help to introduce Magna's group to the Hilltop residents, as well as Carol. Michonne and Carol have a private conversation, revealing that there is a lot of \\"broken world\\" between Alexandria, the Hilltop, and the Kingdom, making it difficult to continue their past friendship, or for Alexandria to participate in an upcoming fair. Henry gets settled into the Hilltop as apprentice to blacksmith Earl, as Carol returns to the Kingdom, but discovers that Enid, his crush, is in a relationship with Alden. Depressed, Henry meets with a group of teenagers, who invite him to join them that evening for some debauchery at a secret shelter outside the gates. After drinking heavily, they show him a walker that they have been using as a plaything, but Henry quickly dispatches it and the rest of the group abandons him. When he returns on his own, Tara and Earl put him in a cell for drunken disobedience. Though Earl considers sending Henry back to the Kingdom, he becomes sympathetic to Henry due to his own drunken mistakes and promises to speak to Jesus on his behalf. At Alexandria, Gabriel sits with Negan, trying to comfort him, but Negan continues to antagonize his efforts. Later, the riders from the Hilltop arrive with news that Rosita was injured and has been taken to the Hilltop. When Gabriel next sees Negan, he goes off on Negan's behavior, telling him that he is forced to stay to watch over Negan instead of seeing to Rosita, earning Negan's genuine sympathy; Gabriel brushes it off. That night, Negan discovers that the door to his cell was left unlocked and exits it. At the Hilltop, Rosita wakes and immediately warns Michonne and Tara of the threat she and Eugene discovered, and that Daryl's group is not safe. Daryl's group lures the herd away and goes to a barn that was near Rosita's location, where they find Eugene hidden under its floor. Eugene explains to them that Rosita stashed him there due to his knee injury and warns them that the herd outside is unusual, having heard them speaking before and that they have come through twice before looking for him. He suggests the possibility that the walkers may have evolved into more intelligent foes. The group quickly find that the herd is approaching the barn and evacuate. Daryl offers to lead the herd away while the others take Eugene back to the Hilltop. However, despite creating a distraction with fireworks and Dog's barking, the herd continues on following the others. Aaron, Eugene, and Jesus eventually get trapped into a walled cemetery, and as they take out the front line of walkers, Michonne arrives with others from the Hilltop to help rescue them, but Jesus decides to stay back to cover the others. Jesus dispatches several walkers, but one of them ducks his blade, grabs and stabs him, warning him that they are where they \\"do not belong.\\" Suddenly, Daryl arrives and takes out the walker while the group clears the rest. As Aaron mourns over Jesus' body, Daryl examines the walker that killed Jesus, revealing it was a living human wearing a mask made out of a walker's skin. Before they can process the situation, whispers around them get louder; the group circles up preparing for a fight. Production Paul \\"Jesus\\" Rovia played by Tom Payne \\"Evolution\\" marked the death of Paul \\"Jesus\\" Rovia (Tom Payne). Jesus was at first a recurring character in the sixth season, but then became part of the main cast since. His death to the Whisperers is a significant change from the comic arc, in which Jesus helps to spearhead the communities' fight against the Whisperers and comes to have a long-term relationship with Aaron. Payne stated that he was not disappointed in leaving the show as he had become frustrated by how little the character has been used, despite the fact that he had taken efforts to train for various action roles that had been suggested by the comic storyline during the war with the Saviors and Whisperers. He stated \\"it was mutual and they knew I would be OK with it. It's an amazing show and I was so honored to be a part of it, but at the same time, being the same character without anything fun to do is a bit frustrating.\\" Payne did ask showrunner Angela Kang to make sure his departure was done \\"to make sure we were telling a story that surprises the audience\\" and was happy that his death formally presented the human Whisperers on the show. He did not rule out his reappearance in the second half of season nine, alluding to the show's plans to have flashbacks into the six-year time jump following Rick Grimes' disappearance in \\"What Comes After\\" that led to the current division between the survivor communities. Reception =Critical reception= \\"Evolution\\" received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 81% with an average score of 7.4 out of 10, based on 21 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \\"The Walking Dead delivers an unnerving midseason cliffhanger  and a new and terrifying threat  although some viewers may feel that the ghoulish Whisperers are a retread of the same old antagonists with a new, rotting face. =Ratings= \\"Evolution\\" received a total viewership of 5.09 million with a 2.0 rating in adults aged 18‚Äì49. It was the highest-rated cable program of the night and the episode increased in viewership from the previous week.

Establishment  Before the arrival of the crusaders to Syria in the late 11th century, the Orthodox bishops of Sidon had been suffragans of the archbishops of Tyre, who were in turn subject to the authority of the Orthodox patriarchs of Antioch. The first crusader king of Jerusalem, Baldwin I captured Sidon with the assistance of Venetian and Norwegian fleets on 5 December 1110. He wanted to ensure that all sees in his kingdom were subject to the Latin patriarchs of Jerusalem. He and Patriarch Ghibbelin, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, asked Pope Paschal II to authorize the expansion of the jurisdiction of the see of Jerusalem to include the diocese of Sidon. The Pope accepted their proposal and declared in 1111 that the boundaries of the ecclesiastic provinces should follow the political borders, making Sidon subject to Jerusalem. However, the patriarchs of Antioch, Bernard of Valence, lodged an objection with the Holy See and prevented the appointment of a bishop subject to Jerusalem at Sidon. From the 14th-century, the Sidon became a Titular see.

NGC 2936 is interacting with elliptical galaxy NGC 2937, located just beneath it. They were both discovered by Albert Marth on Mar 3, 1864.. To some astronomers, the galaxy looks like a penguin or a porpoise. NGC 2936, NGC 2937, and PGC 1237172 are included in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 142 in the category \\"Galaxy triplet\\". On 20 June 2013, the Hubble Space Telescope examined and photographed NGC 2936. NGC 2936 was once part of a flat, spiral disk. The orbits of the galaxies stars have been mixed due to gravitational tidal interactions with NGC 2937. Gas from the center of NGC 2936 became compressed out during the encounter with NGC 2937, which is shown as blue knots closest to NGC 2937. The red dust that has been inside the center of the galaxy has been mostly thrown out due to the collision. During the collision, gas coming from NGC 2936 triggered star formation. PGC 1237172, an unrelated bluish irregular galaxy or edge-on spiral galaxy, is located just off to the side of NGC 2936. It is located 230 million light years away, making it closer to the Earth than the NGC 2936 collision, which it happens to be located next to two unrelated stars from the Milky Way.
